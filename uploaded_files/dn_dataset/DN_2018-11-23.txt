Corruption of previous regime  aggravated economy
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Chamal Rajapaksa said corruption, waste and theft committed during the previous regime has aggravated the economy.
During the previous regime, trafficking in weapons and illicit drugs became grave threats to the people. Expenditure on projects that did not bring any financial dividends was the reason that the country was saddled with an enormous debt burden, Minister Rajapaksa said, speaking at a meeting in Tissamaharama.
A fully-fledged general hospital with 900 beds will be opened at the earliest possible date. The hospital was funded by the Netherlands and has remained unopened for a few years. While there is an acute shortage of beds and medical facilities, the 900-bed general hospital still remains unopened, he said.
The Minister said certain sectors tried to highlight Sri Lanka as an undemocratic country to the world. President Maithripala Sirisena had appointed Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister to shoulder the legacy of the problems of the Ranil Wickremesinghe regime, and forge ahead with development projects.
We must condemn the imprisonment of war heroes and monks without valid reason, the Health Minister said.

Sarath  Malalasekara
He loved us unconditionally
As the eldest granddaughter of senior journalist Sarath Malalasekara, this article is my tribute to an iconic personality who passed away a week ago.
Its been seven days since his departure and we are still in shock over losing him. November 16, 2018, was one of the darkest days of our lives. We are still trying to comprehend our grief, but know that it is not possible.
Seeya was truly a selfless person and was always willing to help others who were in need. I can still remember how he used to give Rs.50 and Rs.100 notes to poor people whenever he met them. He was a lovable person who loved us unconditionally. He used to call anyone younger than him Puthu.
He was a fun and a joyful person who tried to make us happy in every way he could. Though he was a pure vegetarian, he used to take us to fast food outlets to make us happy. He was a special person who earned the love of people, but not money. He didnt care about wealth or status. All he cared about was people and relationships. He was such an influence to our lives and he was truly a role model for us.
Seeya was a hardworking person and loved his profession as a journalist more than anything else. He used to spend most of the day with his colleagues at Lake House. He worked very closely with police officers and they were very fond of him and used to praise him a lot.
He tried his best to produce accurate, relevant, complete and understandable legal and police information to the public without misleading them. Though he was so dedicated to his profession, he never messed up his work life and his personal life. He tried to balance both remarkably.
Each and every person who worked with him at Lake House adored Seeya. He never spoke a hurtful word to them and no one even spoke ill of him. Whenever we visited Lake House, all of them treated us very well because of their love for Seeya. He was like a father to everyone there.
We know that we will have a very difficult road ahead to recover from this huge loss. He was truly a remarkable person and I certainly know that I wont meet such a great personality throughout my lifetime. So, goodbye Seeya. We will miss you a lot and you were the best Seeya in the whole world for the four of us. Love you so much, Seeya.
May you attain
the Supreme Bliss of
Nibbana!

Reinforced electric fences, the best solution to HEC
The Tourism and Wildlife Ministry said that there was no better method to prevent the human-elephant conflict (HEC) other than the setting up of reinforced electric fences.
Digging trenches or setting up fences by growing plants such as bougainvillea, jute, lime and palmyrah had proven to be inefficient and expensive, ministry sources said.
Sixteen districts affected by the human-elephant conflict had been identified, they said, adding that the existing 4,349-kilometre-long electric fence would be extended by 2,500 kilometres to cover more areas under threat.
It would cost Rs.650,000 to Rs.700,000 to extend the fence by one kilometre, sources added.
It had also been reported that the lives of 245 wild elephants and 80 humans had been claimed by the human-elephant conflict so far, this year. Furthermore, 15 Wildlife officials had also died during attempts to drive wild elephants away from villages.
The Wildlife Conservation Department's statistics state that an average of 80 to 90 humans and 150 to 170 elephants lose their lives in the conflict every year.
Elephants usually invade villages and farms in search of food and water during droughts. However, elephants had been recently spotted invading villages in areas such as Thalawa, Korakahawewa, Kahatagasdigiliya, Wahalkada and Palagala, after the rainy season began as well.
Villagers in the affected areas said that they were not provided with enough crackers. They also added that Wildlife officials had not provided any assistance in the matter.
Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando, Chairman of the Centre for Conservation and Research, said studies show that the clearing of forest reserves for farming, or to set up institutions and factories, had aggravated the human-elephant conflict.
"Reinforced electric fences should be erected around villages and not around forest reserves. Furthermore, such fences are being tested in Hambantota, Trincomalee and Kurunegala, and the results have been promising," he added.
Dr. Fernando said that tracking collars would be put on wild elephants in order to locate them and study their movements. This would be useful to develop strategies to minimise the damage caused by the human-elephant conflict.

Badulla District UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri said UNP MPs should give preference to country rather than the political party they represent. The UNP party leadership should be given to a person of the peoples choice.
He was speaking at a media briefing in Bandarawela.
UNP MP Wijesiri went on to say that in the event the party decides to name a common candidate, that candidate should be a person representing the United National Party.
He told the media that the party intends naming a common candidate at the next Presidential Election and that candidate should be from the UNP. I will not agree to any other person being named and I am committed to seeing that our party names the UNP candidate at the next Presidential Election, he said. If the UNP fails to name a candidate from our party, I will have to take a decision giving preference to country and not to the political party to which I belong, he said.

Xi diplomacy provides momentum  for Asia-Pacific development
CHINA: As Chinese President Xi Jinping wrapped up a three-nation Asia-Pacific tour on Wednesday, his proposals on tackling global challenges and promoting win-win cooperation are expected to keep invigorating regional development.
In the latest round of his diplomatic endeavors, or Xiplomacy, Xi paid state visits to Papua New Guinea (PNG), Brunei and the Philippines, and attended the 26th Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC) Economic Leaders Meeting.
Observers say that the strong messages China sent out during the week-long trip, particularly its commitment to opening-up and international collaboration, matter greatly in today's world.
Building a digital future topped the agenda of this year's APEC meeting. As a leading innovator and investor in digital technologies, China has promised to share opportunities with other nations in the region for inclusive and more sustainable growth.
Our goal should be for the benefits of digital economy to reach all member economies at different stages of development and for the people of the Asia-Pacific to get aboard the fast train of a growing digital economy, Xi said at the meeting.
According to official statistics, China's digital economy reached 27.2 trillion yuan (about 3.9 trillion U.S. dollars) in 2017, up 20.3 percent year on year and accounting for 32.9 percent of the country's GDP.
Chinese tech giants like Alibaba and Huawei have expanded their business in Asia-Pacific countries including PNG, offering digital services such as mobile payment and e-trade platforms and providing Internet infrastructure to create jobs and momentum for the local economy.
Meanwhile, the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), proposed by China in 2013 and aimed at building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe, Africa and beyond, has entered a new phase of full implementation.
Xi emphasized that China will work with all countries involved under the principle of consultation and collaboration for shared benefits to pursue the BRI against high standards so that it will create even greater development opportunities for the people in the Asia-Pacific and beyond.
In April next year, China will host the second Belt and Road Forum for International Cooperation in Beijing, and we welcome members of the Asia-Pacific business community to this event, he announced at the 2018 APEC CEO Summit.
In a show of Beijing's commitment to engaging more closely with the rest of the world, China lifted its relations with PNG, Brunei and the Philippines to higher levels during Xi's trip.
During Xi's state visit to PNG, the first by a Chinese head of state to the Pacific island nation, the two sides agreed to upgrade their relationship to a comprehensive strategic partnership, opening a new chapter in the development of bilateral interaction.
Also in PNG, Xi met with leaders of the eight Pacific island countries that have diplomatic ties with China, and they agreed to elevate their relations to a comprehensive strategic partnership featuring mutual respect and common development.
Xi's visit ignited a China passion in the PNG public. China has helped us a lot. Look at the schools here, the road before the parliament, said Kila Vali, a farmer from central PNG. They help teach us how to plant rice. This is important for people here who live by planting to sustain their lives.
In Brunei, the two countries agreed to upgrade their relations to a strategic cooperative partnership, and pledged to be good partners featuring mutual trust in politics, mutual benefit in economy, mutual understanding in people-to-people and cultural exchanges, and mutual assistance in multilateral affairs.
In the Philippines, the two Asian neighbors agreed to lift their ties to a comprehensive strategic cooperative relationship based on mutual respect, sincerity, equality and mutual benefit, and win-win cooperation.
Against the backdrop of increasing unilateralist and protectionist shadows over the global horizon, Xi's statements drew worldwide attention and were widely believed to have infused a dose of confidence and certainty into international relations and global development.
Openness and cooperation are the only way to ensure inclusive and sustainable development, said David Morris, trade commissioner with the Pacific Islands Forum Secretariat, when commenting on Xi's speech at the APEC CEO Summit.
The achievements of APEC and the World Trade Organization have proven the benefits of free trade and open economies, and countries should all recommit to further opening up, he said.
In their meeting with Xi, the leaders of Pacific island countries spoke highly of the leading role played by China in promoting sustainable development, tackling climate change and other areas, and vowed to strengthen communication and coordination with China on international affairs.
Philippine Finance Undersecretary Gil Beltran said his country appreciates Xi's pledge that China welcomes the Philippines and other countries aboard the express train of its development.
Many infrastructure projects are being implemented and I believe there will be more cooperation in the future, Beltran said.
Joahnna Esquivias, a Philippine delegate of the APEC Voices of the Future program, said she looks forward to the implementation of Xi's various proposals in the coming years.
President Xi's speech was truly inspiring and focused on a future of prosperity shared by all, she said.

Blue eye in dogs Infectious Canine Hepatitis
Infectious canine hepatitis is an acute liver infection in dogs caused by canine adenovirus type-1 (CAV-1). There is no treatment for this viral disease, so if your dog is infected it is a matter of managing the illness and allowing your dogs immune system to fight it off and allow him time to recover.
The Virus
Adenovirus type 1 is the more common virus that will attack your dogs liver and other vital organs Adenovirus type 2 causes a contagious infection of the respiratory system and causes a coughing in your dog
Other animals affected
The virus causes disease in wolves, coyotes, and bears, and encephalitis in foxes.
Susceptible age
Young dogs and small puppies are most at risk, as their immune systems are still developing.
Organs affected
This highly contagious viral disease attacks the vital organs of your dogs body such as the liver, kidneys and spleen causing trauma. It also affects the eye coursing corneal opacity.
Signs
The signs are vary from a slight fever of >104F (40C) to death. You must be alert for notice following sings suspecting your dog is affected with Canine Hepatitis. They are; loss of appetite, thirst, tiredness, runny eyes may look bluish and cloudy and nose, red gums of the mouth, develops a cough, vomiting often, swelling around the head and neck area, stomach pain, enlarged tonsils, increase or no urination due kidney damage and severely infected dogs may develop convulsions from forebrain damage. Paresis may result from brain stem hemorrhages.
On recovery, dogs eat well but regain weight slowly. In 25% of recovered dogs, bilateral corneal opacity develops 710 days after acute signs disappear and usually resolves spontaneously.
Spread
Normally virus shed by all excreted body fluids of dogs. If your dog had this disease and recovered, be aware that your dog may still be expelling the virus through his urine and other fluids (nasal drips) up to (9) nine months after infection so if you have other dogs on the property they may get infected. The disease is never transmitted to human.
Diagnosis
The veterinarian can confirm just through a physical examination or by a blood test.
Most of the labs in Sri Lanka have the facilities to diagnose this disease.
Other tests such as radiographs and urine tests may also be performed to diagnose the disease.
Treatment
There is no treatment for the viral infection, it is a matter of supporting your dog through the course of the disease until your dogs body immunity takes over and recovery begins. Treatment is symptomatic and supportive. Intravenous fluids to reduce dehydration and to reduce secondary infection a course of antibiotics to protect your dog will be given by the vet. It is highly advisable to keep the dog in ICU to prevent secondary infection and to support quick recovery. Eye drops to ease the irritation as they heal, but protect your dog from bright light until his eyes have recovered.
In serious cases
There is excessive internal bleeding and blood clotting, your veterinarian may suggest a Plasma or whole blood transfusions may be necessary in severely ill dogs.
Prevention
Disease can be prevented by vaccination. There are different types of vaccines available in the world against this disease. In Sri Lanka also vets practice vaccination.
Vaccines available
The vaccine is a couple vaccine against other two diseases which is called as DHL vaccine. The H stands for Cannine Heapatitis. The vaccine is available at your veterinarian.
Vaccination schedule in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka dogs should get the 1st shot of vaccine at the 8th week of age as the presence of maternal antibodies in the puppies body decrease at the age of 8 weeks. Thereafter a booster vaccine is recommended at 3 months of age. The shelf life of the vaccine is one year. An annual vaccination is suggested to continue the immunity of your dog.
Caring for infected dog
You have to understand the disease may end up with death. Dogs affected with hepatitis are very weak and recovery is just a matter of time, rest, plenty of liquids and lots of love and care. Regular health checks with your veterinarian are advised, just to make sure there are no secondary infections. Your dog may not have a lot of energy for a while, so allow him time to rest and respect that it will take time until your dog is back to full health. Keeping your dogs bedding clean and sterile is advisable, especially if there are other pets in the vicinity, to avoid them being infected. If you do have other dogs or a cat, make sure you get them vaccinated immediately. The virus survives outside the host for weeks or months, but a 1%3% solution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach) is an effective disinfectant.

Agro-based industries: An extended arm  of agriculture
Agro-based industries are important for a developing country for its economic prosperity. It leads to the creation of forward and backward linkages in the development process on a large scale by making agriculture and industries mutually beneficial to each other. On the other hand, the development of agro-based industries can help realise various linkages or inter-relationships between industry and agriculture. This article explains the nature and classifications of agro-based industries, the importance of agro-based industries for a developing country, the best location, and key success and failure factors of agro-based industries. In addition, the status of agro-based industries in the Sri Lankan context is also presented. Therefore, this will help the reader to understand the nature, importance and factors determining the sustainability of agro-based industries in detail.
Nature of agro-based industries
Industries which have either direct or indirect links with the agriculture sector are considered as agro-based industries. Therefore, industries which are based on agricultural produce and industries which support agriculture come under agro-based industries. There are a number of classifications for agro-based industries.
Agro-based industries can be divided into four main sub-sectors based on the final product as follows:
Agro-produce processing units: These industrial units simply process the agriculture produce. They do not manufacture any new products, but the bulkiness of the produce is reduced. They simply process raw materials so that it can be preserved or transported. Rice mills are a good example of this sector.
Agro-produce manufacturing units: These units manufacture entirely new products based on agricultural produce as the main raw material. Therefore, the finished goods will be entirely different when compared to the original raw material. Tomato processing factories can be categorised under this sector.
Agro-input manufacturing units: These industrial units produce goods either for mechanisation of agriculture or for increasing productivity of agriculture. These units are directly linked with agriculture as they support agriculture at various stages.
Agro-service units: These are the workshops and service centres engaging in repairing and servicing of agricultural implements and machinery.
Agro-based industries can also be categorised into three groups based on their scale of production and are presented here.
Village industries: These industries are owned and managed by rural households with very little capital investment and a high level of manual labour.
Small-scale industries: These industries can be characterised by medium investment and semi-automation.
Large-scale industries: These industries involve large investments and a high level of automation.
Another way of classifying agro-based industries is the level of processing. The processing level can be at the primary, secondary or tertiary stage.
Primary staged agro-based industries: The output will be a semi-processed item.
Secondary staged agro-based industries: The output will be a fully processed item.
Tertiary staged agro-based industries: Branding and packaging the product will be carried out at this stage and the output will be ready for use by the consumer.
Further, the level of processing and manufacturing in an agro-based industry can also be classified into three groups as manual, mechanical and chemical and a combination thereof.
Importance of agro-based industries in a developing country
Agro-based industries help create new markets for agricultural produce, provide a stable income to the farmers, reduce post harvest losses, generate new employment opportunities on a large scale mainly in the rural sector, provide consumer choice for the consumables, improve both social and physical infrastructure, and finally increase the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of a country with a value added income. Consequently, economic prosperity of a country can be achieved by developing agro-based industries.
Agro-based industries mainly comprise the post-harvest activities of processing and preserving agricultural products for intermediate or final consumption. It is well-known, particularly in the context of industrial development that the importance of agro-based industries relative to agriculture increases as economies develop. It is also emphasised in the present food consumption scenario that food is not just produce. Food also encompasses a wide variety of processed products. Hence the agro-based industry is an important and a vital part of the manufacturing sector in developing countries and the means for building industrial capacities.
The global market is looking forward to processed spices, vegetables and fruits. Further, food processing has a wide scope that transforms raw and semi-processed agri-produce into specified consumables providing the consumer a qualified choice. The competitiveness of the processed food industry is totally dependent on its ability to successfully access and manage its supply chain downstream to the producer and upstream to its consumer. Therefore, the processed food industry plays an important role in the national economy by linking the rural producer base to the national and international marketplace while adding value and creating off-farm employment.
The increasing environmental concerns also provide further stimulus to agro-based industries. Jute and cotton bags which have begun to replace plastic bags are good proof. It is the right time to engage in mass production of low-cost jute or cotton bags to replace plastic bags. Therefore, this indicates that agro-based industries are not only to produce food, but also to produce other usable items.
Only with mass production coupled with modern technology and intensive marketing can the domestic market as well as the export market of agro-based products be exploited to the fullest extent. On the other hand, large-scale investment and adoption of the latest technologies, intensive marketing efforts, brand name and international collaborations are important to capture a high demand in the local market and obtain a fair share of the export market.
Agro-based industries appeared to offer important commercial opportunities for the private sector too. However, the private sector is yet to actualise the full potential of the agro industry. At the same time, at present, the lack of linkages between production, processing and marketing is the primary factor constraining the development of the industry and this constraint has a large impact on small-scale farmers as those farmers generally have no reliable markets for their goods.
The best location for agro-based industries
Establishment of agro-based industries at a particular place is mainly based on the availability of raw material. Therefore, it is feasible to set up these industries in rural areas where raw materials are available in plenty. On the other hand, establishment of agro-industries in rural areas helps developing the rural economy. They provide employment opportunities to the rural population and will generate income and thereby improve the economic conditions of the people. This in turn will create potential for demand-based industries too. Other benefits of establishing agro-based industries in rural areas are reducing the exploitation of producers by middlemen, assuring a better price for producers, bringing more areas under different crops, reducing the transport costs of produce and thereby the price of the finished products, and reducing wastage of perishable agricultural commodities.
At the macro level, establishment of agro-based industries in rural areas helps decentralise and disperse industries, bring the rural economy on par with the urban economy, achieve a balanced growth of industry and agriculture, improve infrastructure facilities in rural areas and create potential for the establishment of other industries in rural areas, and develop backward areas preventing the migration of people from rural areas to urban areas.
Key success factors of agro-based industries
A list of success factors of agro-based industries can be identified and some of the main factors are presented here.
1. Strong controls on the purchase price of raw material need to be observed. Generally, supply of raw material is not stable throughout the year and as a result, there can be huge variations in prices. It is therefore recommended to estimate the raw material requirement for the year and this should be contracted in advance with the suppliers to avoid drastic changes in the prices of raw materials.
2. The entire production process has to be monitored very closely. Special attention should be paid to appropriate technology, technical feasibility of raw materials, and accessibility of raw materials.
3. Quality maintenance will play an important role as it is evident from the behaviour of the general consumers that they are more specific towards health issues than ever before.
4. Waste production should be kept at minimum.
5. Advance orders for sale can ensure the success of the business.
6. The cost accounting system should be strengthened to monitor the entire process and determine the reasons for major variances in the process, such as material, labour and factory overhead variance.
Agro-based industries: failure factors
Similar to success factors, a list of failure factors of agro-based industries can also be identified and the main factors are presented here.
1. A main constraint leading to failures of these industries is the non-availability of raw material throughout the year. On the other hand, agro-based industries are in a vulnerable state mainly due to irregular supply of raw materials.
2. Changing cropping patterns can make the factory defunct.
3. Failure of the monsoon may hit the supply of raw material.
4. Lack of proper guidance for entrepreneurs.
5. Difficulties in financing certain capital-intensive agro-basedunits by institutions.
6. Inadequate promotional activities by governments anddepartments.
7. Uncertainty about market demand due to absence ofinformation regarding the market.
8. Absence of a proper integration and coordination mechanismamong various relevant institutions and agencies.
Agro-based industries: Sri Lankan context
Other than a few large, medium and small-scale companies, most of the agro-based industries in Sri Lanka comprise a multitude of self-employed proprietorships. At the same time, the industries registered in the formal sector are prominent in the export and local market though they are small in number. Most of the self-employed manufacturers carry out small-scale operations and the quantity of produce is not up to the satisfaction of leading importers of products in the international market. However, these producers are playing a key role in the rural market.
Researchers have identified the strengths, weaknesses, threats and opportunities pertaining to agro-based industries in Sri Lanka and the identified factors are presented here.
Strengths
1. Small country with easy access and communication facilities toany part. This helps to have a feasible and efficient managementof any project.
2. Suitable climate for year-round production.
3. Availability of literate, trainable, skilled and unskilledworkforce.
4. Availability of a quick-to-respond farming community.
5. Experience and knowledge available in the support systems
such as the Agriculture Department, universities and researchorganizations.
6. Reputation achieved by Sri Lankan tea and coconut productsin the international markets. This could be taken an advantage inmarketing other processed fruits and vegetables in theinternational market.
7. Strategic location close to sea levelWeaknesses
1. Low productivity
2. High cost of production causing the products to be notcompetitive in the market
3. High levels of post-harvest losses and inadequate assistance
and incentives to minimise post-harvest losses
4. Weak supply situation or no investment in cultivation ofcrops for the processing industry
5. Crop surplus during the harvest season is inevitable.However, the high cost of transport and storage are disincentivesto the processing sector to increase purchase during the harvest
season.
6. Poor flow of information to relevant stakeholders.
7. Lack of coordination between regulatory bodies and industry.
8. Lack of policies, incentives and development fundsfor the sector.
Threats
1. Lack of a conducive environment.
2. Competition from other developing countries.
3. Availability of cheap imports in the local market.
4. Availability of well-financed promotional programmes
for imported and junk foods.
5. Difficulties to compete with imported products.
Opportunities
1. The British made Sri Lanka as the tea garden of the world.
It is a good opportunity for us to explore the international
market.
2. Changes in food habits.
3. Increasing Asian population in the developed markets.

Australia, England, S. Korea  share lead at Golf World Cup
Melbourne, Thursday: Cameron Smith birdied the 18th to give Australia a share of the lead with England and South Korea on the opening day of the golf World Cup Thursday.
They conquered the Metropolitan Golf Club in Melbourne with 10-under par 62s in opening fourball action, with Malaysia, Belgium and defending champions Denmark a stroke further back.
The American pairing of Kyle Stanley and Matt Kuchar are four off the pace in a group of seven nations, including France and Japan.
Smith and partner Mark Leishman were among the favourites coming into the US$7 million tournament and they lived up to expectations in blustery conditions, although forecast storms held off.
I think we just combined really well, Smith said at the 28-team tournament.
Leish was saying once one of us was in trouble, the other just had to hit the centre of the green and give ourselves a birdie opportunity from 20 or 30 feet. We both played really well all day and just kept being smart.
Nothing would make English Ryder Cup teammates Ian Poulter and Tyrrell Hatton happier than spoiling the Australian party.
It looked like the rival sporting nations would be playing together in the second-round foursomes, but a late charge by the impressive South Korean team of An Byeong-hun and Kim Si-woo vaulted them into a share of the lead.
Australia will instead tee-off on Friday with Malaysian duo Gavin Green and Ben Leong, who combined for two eagles and five birdies.
It was good team golf really. I think it was just solid all around, said Green.
The holes I birdied, he didnt birdie, so we always had alternate holes, which we did well on and it is a good thing especially in this format.
England sunk 10 birdies, and Poulter, a team event veteran, said it was crucial to do so in the fourball format to get into a good position.
In fourballs, or better ball, both players have a ball but only the better score counts for each hole. In foursomes, or alternate shot, teammates take it in turns to play the same ball.
Foursomes (the second and fourth rounds) is a completely different game, Poulter said.
You need to put the ball in play and if we get blustery weather, its going to be tricky.
Foursomes is the day when you can take yourself out of the tournament pretty quickly. The tournament will be won or lost on Friday and Sunday in the foursomes rounds.
Hatton said Poulter saved the team on the back nine, with his putting helping them drop six birdies to come home in 30, two better than the Australians could muster on the homeward stretch. AFP

Baby survives being  run over by train
An Indian baby who was dropped onto railway tracks moments before a train passed through the station has escaped unscathed.
The dramatic incident, captured on cell phone footage Thursday, showed a train rolling over the infant in Uttar Pradesh state as screaming onlookers stand by hopelessly.
The one-year-old reportedly fell into the gap between the carriage and the platform as the girl's parents were stepping off the train.
She was wedged flat on her back alongside the track as the train left the platform, picking up speed and thundering overhead -- but just missing her.
Once the train passed a man quickly scooped up the tiny child who, apart from crying, was astonishingly left unscathed by the terrifying incident.
Indian media reported that the girl's parents lost grip of their child as a crowd surged from the train onto the platform in Mathura city.
Indian railway officials said the lucky escape was a reminder to be cautious at all times on crowded trains.
We are actively running campaigns to sensitise people against travelling on rooftops or standing on foot boards of the train doors, said G K Bansal, a railways spokesman.
India's huge railway network is notorious for overcrowding and accidents, including scores who die while crossing the tracks illegally or falling off over-capacity trains. A 2012 government report described the loss of 15,000 passengers to rail accidents every year in India as a massacre. The government has pledged $137 billion over five years to modernise the crumbling network. - AFP

Bajaj upbeat on Lankan market
Top officials of Bajaj Auto Limited addressing media in Pune India at the Bajaj Headquarters said the company through its partner David Pieris Motor Company (Pvt) Ltd (DPMC) has maintained a steady growth in the market share over the years in Sri Lanka and is optimistic the growth will continue despite domestic and global slowdowns.
Bajaj enjoys a market share of 92 % for three-wheelers and 65 % for two-wheelers in Sri Lanka.
Bajaj recorded sales of over four million vehicles which is a nine percent growth over the previous year exporting to over 75 countries. From April to September this year, the company has sold over one million vehicles globally. Bajajas latest addition, the quadricycle Qute is poised to make a mark in the Sri Lankas transportation sector as a family, cost efficient and convenient mode of transportation. Known as My Family Vehicle in Sri Lanka, sales of Qute crossed 650 units since its launch in April this year.

For Bajaj Qute, we already have received central government approval in June 2018 to sell in India. As of today, we have received STA (State transport Authority) approvals in 18 states.

The sale of Bajaj Qute is expected to rise sharply in Sri Lanka Shanaka Jayaweera, Director Vehicle Sales David Pieris Motor Company (Pvt) Ltd said. This is in the backdrop of Qute gaining vastly popular in Europe, America and Japan. Jayaweera said the company has the capacity to localise and go up to value addition of the Bajaj range of vehicles in Sri Lanka. However, he said the project has not been able to take off so far due to absence of concessions from the Government.

Grihapathy said they expect a higher penetration in the Sri Lankan market despite a minor slowdown in sles last year and Bajaj has the ability to adapt to volatile situations in markets across the globe. The situation in Sri Lanka is only a temporary setback which will fade off in a matter of time, he said adding Bajaj has faced similar situations in Turkey, Argentina and Nigeria. The state of affairs in Sri Lanka will re-bounce and business will be back to normal, Grihapathy said.
Bajaj is also considering moving into electric vehicles as it upgrades and promotes environment friendly transportation across countries.
We will look into this aspect. However, we also have to ensure the specifications and eco-systems are right. We will watch the situation in countries and embark on the project, Bajaj Vice President Marketing, Manish Sigh Rathore said. The Qute has been designed in response to requirements of low cost, first and last mile public transport across the world by optimising size, weight, cost and speed.

## Title: BARCLAY GORDON BUDDY REID

BARCLAY GORDON BUDDY REID
There have been a few instances of sets of brothers playing for their schools, clubs and with some of them going on to sport Sri Lanka caps.
Among them the leaders were the nine Fernandopulle brothers who played and all kept wickets for St.Benedicts College, Kotahena which deserves mention in the Guinness Book of the records, AMENDRA brothers from Mahinda College Galle, the RANATUNGA and WETTIMUNY brothers from Ananda College also come to mind.
But five brothers to play school cricket and excel for St. Thomas College, the school by the sea at Mount Lavinia were the REID brothers  CLAUDE, RONNIE, BUDDY, BARNEY and TINY.
It is said that there were five Saram brothers who played for the Mount Lavinia school before the REIDS.
Most outstanding
But of the five brothers the most outstanding and who became a double international was BARCLAY GORDON BUDDY REID who played cricket and Table Tennis for the country and also captained Ceylon against MCC in 1968/69. A rare and proud feat one might say who is our SPORTS LEGEND today..
BUDDY started his cricketing career as an opener. And how he became an opener is interesting. The coach at STCML at that time Lassie Abeywardena had picked 10 out of the under 12 squad and was looking for an opening batsman to make up the final eleven.
BUDDY who was not in the 10 . When Abeywardena mentioned that he was looking for an opener who could face the new ball, BUDDY put his hand up and padded up in that position and hugged that slot as he moved on playing in the first XI side, University, BRC and Ceylon.
Only one season
Interestingly he played for the school only in one season. That was in 1959 under tearaway fast man Dennis Ferdinands. He was keen and looking forward like all Royal-Thomian cricketers do, to play in the Battle of the Blues. He was all keyed up when he received a letter saying that he was eligible for admission to Medical College. That ended his school career.
BUDDY was a buddy to anyone who made his acquaintance. He was a reliable opening batsman with tons of concentration offering a straight bat and made big runs while his career progressed. He was a crafty leg spinner too and troubled the best of batsmen with bowling variations.
After a promising school career in both cricket and ping pong, BUDDY had his first feel of ball on bat at the University was when he came under the captaincy of that former Peterite batsman, captain and wicket keeper who was later classed the best gloveman in Asia Dr. Herbert I.K. Fernando.
Bright future
Fernando who spotted BUDDY the first time predicted a bright future for him. He did not prove Fernando wrong and lived up to his prediction by making big runs in the Uni and in making a big 170 against Catamarans in 1960 in Sara Trophy cricket. He pocketed the Macan Markar trophy for the highest score of the season. Whatever has happened to that trophy now.
BUDDY during his career headed the SARA trophy averages twice in the 62/63 and the 63/64. The 62/63 season saw Carlyle Perera as captain when the Colombo University emerged champions. And in 63/64 BUDDY captained.
BUDDYS achievements did not go unnoticed by the cricket selectors of that era who rightfully gave him his national cap selecting him to front up to Australias side led by Bobby Simpson in 1964. Making his debut he left his mark with a stand of 68 in just 29 minutes with his school mate Michael Tissera who was the captain.
Member ofwinning team
BUDDY was a member of the team that chalked up its first unofficial Test victory against Pakistan led by that dashing opening batsman Imtiaz Ahmed. If my memory serves me right at the end of the game Ahmed made some flimsy excuses blaming the wicket and the weather for their defeat which criticism did not go down well with the Pakistan Cricket Board who reprimanded Ahmed.
BUDDY also played in the first Sri Lankan team to beat England in a 60-over game in 1969 where with the writers team mate at SBC Ranjit Fernando they hoisted an opening stand of 121 with Buddy digging in with 57 and Fernando 58. Both remaining unbeaten.
Then again the pair was involved in an unbroken stand of 118 in the second innings in an unofficial Test against England with BUDDY unbeaten on 50 and Fernando too unbeaten on 59. Of the bowlers England had in that team was fast man John Snow.
Tormentedbatsmen
Snow had tormented the Aussie batsmen down under. An Aussie spectator annoyed by the short pitched bowling by Snow pulled him by the shirt when he was fielding on the boundary which prompted Captain Ray Illingworth to take the team off the field for a while to allow tempers to cool. BUDDY also had the good fortune of captaining Sri Lanka.
But it was in table tennis that he represented the country most. To be a great TT player one must be fit, have a quick eye, agile and have the repertoire of strokes that could make one a player of international class. And BUDDY had it all in full abundance.
He pocketed the national singles title for three years. He also showed his dexterity in the doubles event by winning the title six times. His partner in winning it four times was Nimo Ramachand and once with that great player and administrator Charlie Daniel and again with his brother Barney.
Captained the country
Not satisfied, he went on to also captain the country at TT at the Asian Games in Bangkok, the Asian TT Championships in Singapore and the international in Peking, China.
BUDDY and his family later moved to Australia, where he continued to be better than most Australians in TT. In 2007 he won the Victorian State Championship Masters event and repeated this success in New Zealand. But a treasured moment was when he won Silver Medal at the World Masters Championships in 2006 partnered by Igor Klaf.
BUDDY showed that he has not lost the thirst for further success when a few months back also partnered by Igor Kalf they won the over 75 doubles title at the World TT Championships in Las Vegas. Great when one considers that DR. BUDDY REID a Sri Lankan still continues to stay in the game keeping himself extremely fit. An example to all sports people.

Beaten All Blacks keep faith with  Barrett, McKenzie
Rome, Thursday: The All Blacks will persist with a two-pronged attack against Italy on Saturday, despite coach Steve Hansen ringing the changes after last weeks loss to Ireland.
Hansen retained fly-half Beauden Barrett and fullback Damien McKenzie in a starting line-up featuring 11 changes from the side that ran out in Dublin, resisting calls to start the in-form Richie Mounga.
Instead Mounga stays on the bench as Hansen sticks with his strategy of using Barrett and McKenzie as dual playmakers.
The combination has failed to fire so far, with the world champions scraping to a 16-15 win over England then losing 16-9 to Ireland last week.
Hansen was confident Barrett and McKenzie, with Mounga as backup, would improve before next years World Cup in Japan.
Thats the three guys that we see at the moment that would most likely go to the World Cup, so getting them combining, either at the beginning of the game or during the course of the game, is important, he said.
We havent got too many games left so the more we play them together, the better it will be.
Captain Kieran Read and flanker Ardie Savea were the only other starters retained after the Ireland loss as Hansen opted to give some of his big names a break in the final match of the season against Italy.
Notable selections include Jordie Barrett on the right wing and Dane Coles returning as hooker in a new-look front row also featuring Nepo Laulala and Ofa Tuungafasi.
Hansen expected a strong defensive performance from Italy, saying the All Blacks could not allow them to dictate terms.
Our goal will be to create quality set-piece ball and lightning quick ruck ball, coupled with a real accuracy in our decision-making so we can use our skillsets accordingly, he said.
Team (15-1)
Damian McKenzie; Jordie Barrett, Anton Lienert-Brown, Ngani Laumape, Waisake Naholo; Beauden Barrett, TJ Perenara; Kieran Read (capt), Ardie Savea, Vaea Fifita; Scott Barrett, Patrick Tuipulotu; Nepo Laulala, Dane Coles, Ofa Tuungafasi

Brain games help prevent Alzheimers
As we age, keeping our brain sharp becomes more and more important. No one knows this better than Jessica Langbaum, a specialist in Alzheimers prevention and associate director of the Alzheimers Prevention Initiative in Phoenix, Arizona.
While some suggest crossword puzzles and games like Sudoku to give the brain mental stimulation, Langbaum shares that Alzheimers prevention is a bit more complex.
Just sitting down and doing Sudoku isnt probably going to be the one key thing thats going to prevent you from developing Alzheimers disease, she tells NPR. Something as simple as getting up and going to work actually can help do the trick. Langbaum points out that daily multitasking, processing of information, and remembering things that come up during the workday are all incredible forms of brain training.
Langbaum, who was spurred to study Alzheimers after her grandfather was diagnosed when she was in graduate school, has learned over time that puzzles and games focus too narrowly on just one part of the brain. This can lead to other areas going into decline. She equates it with exercising just one muscle in the body instead of focusing on overall fitness.
Instead, the brain training programs used in research are quite challenging. Langbaum would know. She tried them when taking part in a revolutionary study on the effectiveness of brain training. In the study, about 2,800 people age 65 and up trained for more than five weeks doing exercises that tested memory, reasoning, or speed. The results showed that the reasoning and speed tests had a positive impact, even some years later.
While it remains unclear if brain training can really delay or prevent Alzheimers, new research is showing that another good form of mental stimulation comes from social interaction. People who have a lot of social interactions, particularly in mid-life, have a lower risk of Alzheimers dementia in later life, shares Langbaum. Theres something about being around people thats helpful for our brains.
All told, Langbaums advice is to keep yourself active and well-rounded. This means doing crossword puzzles if you enjoy them, but also continuing to push yourself out of your comfort zone and try new things.

Bride and cross-dressing groom wear matching wedding dresses
Most brides would cringe at the idea of someone turning up on their wedding day in a white dress. But for Emma Sparre-Newman, 51, it made her big day extra special  particularly as it was the groom who was wearing it.
Her husband Ian Newman, 53, has been dressing almost exclusively in womens clothing for the past two years so when it came to the wedding day, Emma knew that they would both wear a dress. But when they went shopping together, they happened to fall in love with the same 50s style strapless gown.
So at their wedding in Las Vegas on 21 September, they said their vows in matching dresses and heels.
Emma and Ian met at the Larmer Tree Festival in Tollard Royal in Dorset in 2014. Emma was co-managing one of the stages and Ian was performing with one of the acts  The Antipoet, an anarchic punk poetry/comedy act.
Standing at around 6ft 8 in his high heeled patent fetish boots, top hat and with his long hair and kilt, he does rather make an impression; not to mention that he is accompanied by an equally flamboyant poet and a double bass; so it is fair to say that Ian had caught my eye, Emma told Metro.co.uk.
However, the first few years that I was running the stage, Ian wasnt single and so ours was nothing more than a professional working relationship. Im not sure that Ian even really noticed me but he claims that he assumed I was partnered up with my fellow stage manager.
But in 2016, they discovered they were both single. They got talking between sets and hit it off. With Emma living and working as communications manager at My Aerial Home in London and Ian based in St Albans, they spent a month texting and emailing before they met up again a month later. And when Emma went to visit Ian in St Albans a few weeks later, she discovered another side to his life.
She explained, Before I arrived he told me that when he was at home, he preferred to dress more fabulously. I had only ever seen him dressed in a kilt and an assortment of velvet and lace jackets so wasnt sure how much more fabulous he was going to be able to get, but when I arrived at his house he was dressed as a woman. It was the first I knew of his interest in cross-dressing, so it was a bit of a surprise, but it didnt stop me from giving him a hug and telling him that he certainly did look fabulous. He then said that he had an alter ego who was called Diane, so I shook his hand and said Hallo, Diane, Im delighted to meet you.
Although Emma was surprised, she realised that this was something that was an important aspect of Ians life.
After two years together, the couple started planning a trip to Vegas and they decided to get married while they were there.
Initially, they wanted to keep the big day secret and just get married in a Las Vegas chapel but Ian wanted to tell his daughter from his previous marriage and Emma felt like she had to tell her family too.
Although they had gained a few guests, they still didnt want an elaborate wedding. Emma thought she would just wear something she had in her wardrobe  but then Ian interjected.
Emma explained, I was still desperately trying to downplay it all, when my friend Amanda asked dont you want a lovely frock Just as I was replying that I already had many lovely frocks, Ian piped up with, I do.
That pretty much signified the turning point. Amanda set about organising taking me to some wedding dress shops and we were going to leave Ian to make his own arrangements.
While Emma was trying on dresses at FairyGothmother, in Deptford, South East London, she asked the manager if she would object to a man trying on dresses.
Emma picked out the strapless tea-length dress but never expected Ian to choose the same thing when he visited the store a few weeks later.
Ian and I have very different ideas about what constitutes a good outfit and so we had no expectations that we would wear the same dress, she said.
As Ian tried on various styles, it was Emma, the shop manager, who asked him if he had seen my dress. She then pointed out that we were the exact same dress size and asked him if he wanted to try it on. Ian asked me if I would mind if he did and it didnt bother me at all. Even before Emma had done it up, Amanda and I both just said thats it, thats the dress.
He looked amazing.
It never occurred to me to be precious about my dress. It was our wedding and I never once considered that I wouldnt want to share the entire experience with Ian being just as important and involved in the whole thing.

The absence of a bridge over the Kelani river on the Yatiberiya - Thebuwa road in the Ambagamuwa, Nuwara-Eliya, has inconvenienced the residents of Thebuwa and Yatiberiya.
Hence, villagers have been compelled to cross the river using an outrigger canoe. They said that the river often overflowed during rainy seasons, and added that they had to risk their lives every time they crossed it.

British MPs slam MI5 over  Manchester Arena bombing
MPs investigating Britain's 2017 terror attacks said Thursday that the MI5 security service missed key opportunities to stop the Manchester Arena bomber.
Parliament's Intelligence and Security Committee, a cross-party panel of lawmakers that scrutinises the work of government in these fields, slammed communications service providers (CSPs) for giving terrorists a safe haven.
The ISC also said their recommendations on previous failings had gone ignored.
Britain suffered five terrorist attacks in 2017: at Westminster, London Bridge, Finsbury Park and Parsons Green in London; and at the Manchester Arena, where 22 were killed in a suicide bombing.
Thirty-six people were killed in total in the attacks.
The Manchester Arena attack, as concert-goers were leaving an Ariana Grande show, was perpetrated by 22-year-old Salman Abedi, a Mancunian of Libyan descent.
The ISC's report said the MI5 domestic security agency missed chances to stop Abedi, moving too slowly after his case had been flagged for review and failing to consider him for referral to the anti-radicalisation scheme.
Abedi also visited an extremist contact in prison on more than one occasion but no follow-up action was taken by either MI5 or the police.
MI5 did not place travel monitoring or restrictions on Abedi, meaning he was allowed to return undetected from Libya to Britain shortly before the bombing.
There were a number of failures in the handling of Salman Abedi's case and while it is impossible to say whether these would have prevented the devastating attack on May 22, we have concluded that, as a result of the failings, potential opportunities to prevent it were missed, the ISC said.
Responding to the report, UK counter-terrorism police said they would study the report's findings carefully.
We are deeply committed to learning so that we can refine our response to the evolving threat, he said.
The committee found 12 cross-cutting issues which played a part in at least two attacks.
On explosives, the system for regulating and reporting purchases of the ingredients used to make explosives was hopelessly out of date in dealing with the threat posed, it said, adding that it had facilitated the perpetrators' actions.
Meanwhile appeals to CSPs to tighten up their loopholes had fallen on deaf ears. The committee said that four years ago they concluded that CSPs were failing to stop their systems being used as a safe haven for extremists and terrorists. - AFP

Car sales drop pending tax cuts
Sri Lankas brand new and reconditioned motor vehicle sales have reached a record low, said Chairman Vehicle Importers Association of Lanka, Sampath Merenchige.
This may be because people are expecting a reduction of taxes for vehicle imports from the new Finance Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, he told Daily News Business.
He disclosed that sales have dropped drastically and a motor sales company that was selling on average around 30 to 35 vehicles per month has now come down to around 3 or 4 vehicles per month.
Soon after the new Prime Minister and Finance Minister was appointed there were a series of concessions that were offered including slashes in taxes.
Merenchige said that people are expecting a similes adjustment of taxes for the motor vehicle sales. However we dont foresee this happening for motor vehicle imports as well as imports of luxury items imports right now.
He said that with the escalating of the US dollar the motor vehicle prices would zoom up after the current consignments were sold out. (SS)

CHENGDU CHAMBER OPENS IN COLOMBO
The Chengdu Association of Foreign Trade and Economic Cooperation (CAFTEC) opened its Colombo Office at the Hilton Residencies (JAIC Hilton) on Monday night.
The opening of the CAFTEC Colombo Office was a soft opening and the Colombo operations would be continued from there which usher in unprecedented economic and trade opportunities for Sri Lanka, a news release said.
CAFTEC Secretary- General Chen Xiao remarked that the reason for the opening of the Colombo office was to promote Chinese investors to come into the Hambantota Industrial Zone and also to promote Sri Lankan exports also into China.
The CAFTEC Secretary General also said that there will be opportunities for the display of Sri Lankan products and particularly in the arenas of tea with a special emphasis on black tea, spices, coconut products and especially virgin coconut oil, apparel, rubber and rubber products gems and Jewellery and many other exportable products to China.
The CAFTEC will also assist Sri Lankan Travel and Tourism companies to attract Chinese tourists into Sri Lanka. Also the Air China four weekly nonstop direct flights from Chengdu to Colombo will also support the cause for tourism.
Meanwhile, President of the International Chamber of Commerce Kosala Wickramanayake said that Chengdu was one of the most dynamic and fastest growing areas in the world and that it was up to Sri Lankan businessmen to synergize their growth opportunities there with 20 million people there.
We have been working closely with CAFTEC from 2015 and we have also signed a MoU in 2017. Opening of the Colombo Branch office has also been a part of that initiative.
Sri Lankan businessmen will also have the opportunity to establish joint venture partnerships at that forum, he said.
He also noted that Sri Lankan business houses will be able to merge synergies with Chengdu businessmen as Chengdu is also on the One Belt One Road route on the Yangetse River which is an open gateway to both Pan Europe and Pan Asia.

Citizens' Mail
Country is everyones concern
Anti-democratic pandemonium staged by the pseudo-patriots the other day in the parliament compels me to speak my heart out because of the very fact that I am away from my motherland on a sojourn in Australia to have a retreat from the unpleasant hustle and bustle of undemocratic demeanour of the wrongly elected members to the supreme body of legislature.
Mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga, so says a Sanskrit proverb. My woe is that while most of the other countries are heading steadily toward development, our country is day-by-day becoming hell-bound.
It is discernible to any Tom, Dick and Harry that most of the people in our country are ignorant. Universal suffrage has proved unfitting to our country.
The pith of the matter is vividly exhibited in the ludicrous election pledges such as rice from the moon, eight measures of grain, giving bread at a low price and so on. The worst of the things is that every ruling party takes the school going population as a guinea pig to intellectually ruin the backbone of the nation.
The whole country is dragged into a treacherous bog of intellectual malnutrition to have their political ride forever.
The long-term tragedy is that almost all the rulers, ministers and parliamentarians send their sons and daughters to advanced countries for their higher education while ruining the national system of education. In other words, these rulers who appear as true leaders seem to turn no stone unturned to come to power through devious channels.
People in other countries label us as a very primitive nation that is not able to digest democracy. The whole country seems to have a loose motion of democracy due to indigestion.
The countrys welfare is every citizens concern at the final count. Therefore only a handful of bogus patriots should not take it as their birthright. That is where the problem lies. The newly elected parliamentarians below O/L, A/L and below ought to be given a thorough footing on religion, literature, history, sociology, political science and other relevant disciplines to politics.
Before becoming the matters worse, in my opinion, it is opportune to remind our leaders Americas first president Abraham Lincoln's definition of democracy Democracy is by the people, for the people, of the people. To cap them all, The ruler thinks of the next election; the statesman thinks of the nation.
The ongoing situation seems to be purely because of the very reason that present-day Sri Lanka has become a battlefield of rulers, but not of the statesmanlike patriots.

Colourful hair art installations
Icelandic artist Hrafnhildur Arnardttir, also known as Shoplifter, uses something unusual to create her colorful art installations - hair. Using both synthetic and real hair, she creates giant fantasy landscapes and sculptures that are at once whimsical and mesmerizing. Braided, molded, brushed, and even melted, hair is layered together to create dynamic artwork that radiates energy.
Her fascination with hair began as a child when she saw her grandmother store one of her cut-off braids in a drawer. Later, it became a way for her to explore a medium that is beautiful and comforting, yet can also spark disgust. I find it fascinating that we have this forever changing vegetation all over our bodies, which we have to groom and tame, Shoplifter shared with Infringe. Hair is a remnant of the wildness that we possess, and one of the few things that survives our existence. Its like a shield, or alternatively it can be a way of showing yourself to the world.
Shoplifter, who has collaborated with Bjrk in the past, brings whimsy and humor to her work. Her large-scale Nervescape installations see vibrant tufts of hair used to create an environment that she hopes embraces visitors. Seeing the work as a world of imaginary nerve endings, for Shoplifter the pieces are both a reflection of our internal landscape and also a fantasy meant to provide a means of escape. This playfulness is a call to remember our youth and to push positive energy into the world.
Big opportunities continue to come Shoplifters way. In 2019, she will represent Iceland in the Venice Biennale. The world will be waiting anxiously to see what she creates given this huge international platform.

Countrys education system needs total revamp  - Dr. Amunugama
Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama yesterday said the countrys educational system does not reflect the capabilities or the determination of young people in the country.
The Minister said the existing education system does not produce the type of young persons who can take the country forward.
Roughly around 250,000 youth seek university education a year in the country and only 30,000 get into universities. This is no reflection of the capabilities or the determination of young people
The Minister stressed the importance of acquiring knowledge on the latest trends of education and technology if the country needs to make progress.
We cannot think of a progress unless we achieve latest trends of education and technology, he said.
Dr. Amunugama was speaking at the convocation of Londontec City Campus held at the BMICH yesterday. Dr Amunugama conferred degrees to a group of promising students who completed the BSc in computing.
The Foreign Minister queried as to what country can do for hundreds and hundreds of capable young people who miss university admission by one mark in the Z-Score or they were not in the best of spirits when they faced the examination. He emphasized that young population in the country should be given an opportunity to contribute the future of the country by ensuring them easy access to modern day technology and management skills.
We have very advanced educational and health systems The country has a safety net for less advantaged people in the country, he added.
He added that the government has a responsibility to see that these young people are trained in the modern trends in education by looking at their aptitudes and help them to make contribution to the countrys progress.
The Minister added that investors coming to Sri Lanka raise questions about the number of young persons trained in modern technologies and management and vital industries in sciences.
If we do not have people trained in modern trends in education and technology, our country will not attract new industries, he said.
He predicted that young population trained in modern technological trends would be main thrust in the countrys economy in the years to come.
Today we are going through an information society, a knowledge based society and we are talking of cloud computing and artificial intelligence. We are thinking of all sorts of new communication methods which are changing everyday.The young population in Sri Lanka are best adjusted to make use of this new technology,"he said.
Londontec City Campus Principal M. H. A. Zulfer was also present.

Dave Group introduces John  Deere farming technology in SL
The internationally renowned John Deere range of farming equipment that has been one of the leading brands in Sri Lanka is to be further enhanced with the introduction of innovative technology.
Dave Group, pioneers in the field of agricultural equipment, and representatives of John Deere in Sri Lanka since 1990, has plans to introduce new technology to farmers in Sri Lanka to increase productivity and enhance profitability.
John Deere which has a history of over 180 years with over thirty factories and offices around the world, has a wide range of agricultural products from 20  650 HP Tractors to Harvesting Equipment, Hay and Forage Equipment,Planting Equipment, Precision Ag Technology, Seeding Equipment and Sprayers and Applicators.
Speaking about the partnership, the Executive Director of Dave Group, Minelle Siriwardena said, Currently, the Dave Group markets agricultural equipment such as 2WD and 4WDtractors, implements, combine harvesters, front end loaders, sprayers and agricultural tools. We also have construction equipment such as excavators and motor graders as well as forestry equipment such as log loaders and timber jacks. In Sri Lanka our staple food is rice and since we cannot fulfill the demand, as a country we import rice from many parts of the world. However, if we do the farming in a scientific way we can easily be self-sufficient. Modern agriculture methodologies will help to improve productivity and provide a greater yield.
Explaining further, Siriwardena said, The traditional farming methods such as ploughing using buffaloes is now on the wane and land isprepared using tractors. We at Dave Group plan to introduce innovations that would help farmers to prepare land faster and mechanize sowing, spraying and harvesting.
Vinayak Vasagade, Sales Manager, John Deere Asia (Singapore), Jurgen Sieber, Director, Sales and Marketing, John Deere Asia, Minelle Siriwardena, Executive Director, Dave Group, Dave Siriwardena, Chairman, Dave Group, Menika, Territory Sales Manager, John Deere Asia (Singapore)
The effects of climate change have a major impact on rice production in Sri Lanka. It is believed that innovative mechanization will help farmers to adapt to these changes and make recovery faster. These innovations could be well within the reach of the farmers.
Siriwardena also spoke about the shortage of manpower in Sri Lanka. This is an issue that needs to be addressed by all stakeholders in the agricultural industry. This is where innovative mechanization can play a vital role in increasing both productivity and profits of farmers.We will be encouraging more farmers to access the newer machinery with innovative technology.
The product range offered by the Dave Group is not limited to the agricultural industry. There is also golf and turf equipment such as mowers, as well as trailers, fully covered garbage tipping trailers, water bowsers and gully bowsers.
The Dave Group has an extensive range of John Deere equipment for the Sri Lankan market and the brand has won global recognition as the leading brand for agricultural machinery and equipment. This leadership in Sri Lanka has been possible through the partnership between John Deere and Dave Group over the past two decades.
We have over 100 dealers Island-wide, and we provide an unbeatable after-sales service. In the years to come we plan to strengthen our partnerships and help Sri Lankan farmers in their bid to reach self-sufficiency, added Siriwardena.

DEMAND FROM RUSSIA MUCH LESS; JAPAN, HONG KONG SELECTIVE
This weeks Colombo Tea Auction which was held on Monday and Wednesday with Tuesdays public Holiday on account of Prophet Mohameds Birthday, saw the demand from Russia much less whilst Japan and Hong Kong were selective, Lanka Commodity Brokers Director Jehan Algama told Daily News Business yesterday.
He also said that there was some interest from the Tea Bag sector operating for selected Middle Eastern Countries and Europe and that the Leafy Low Growns generally held last levels with fair activity from the C.I.S., Middle East and Turkey. Tippy teas however, were irregularly lower on account of weaker demand from Iran in particular, he said.
Meanwhile, Iraq has emerged as the top most importer of Sri Lanka Tea for the period January to October, 2018 having absorbed almost 33 Million kilos, compared to 27.9 Million kilos during the same period last year. Turkey, Russia and Iran follow with intakes of 29.7 Million kilos, 25.9 Million kilos and 20.1 Million kilos respectively, during the first ten months of this year.
Algama also said that Crop intakes in estates of all elevations have been maintained over the past week following favorable weather conditions.
The upcountry plantations reported bright mornings and scattered evening showers whilst Low Growns generally experienced dry conditions, he said.
The Department of Meteorology however, predicts shower conditions during the upcoming days on account of a depression developing in the Bay of Bengal. Latest reports indicate that rains have already been experienced in the Maskeliya /Upcot areas.
This weeks sale quantity of 6.8 Million kilos comprised of 2.9 Million kilos of Low Growns and 1 Million kilos of Ex Estate teas. The Low Grown quality was mostly similar to last, whilst, High Growns on offer in the Ex Estate catalogue saw a further decline both in leaf appearance and liquors.
A total of 1.06 Million kilos were on offer at this weeks Ex-Estate sale which was met with fair general demand at slightly lower rates. Better Western BOPs were lower by Rs. 20 to Rs. 30, whilst the others were lower Rs. 30 to Rs. 40 and at times even more.
Meanwhile, Asia Siyaka Commodities PLC Director/ Senior Vice President Sohan Samaranayake told Daily News Business yesterday Low Growns met with general demand. Except for a Select best BOP1s, most others were firm on last. Well-made stylish OP1s were discounted, whilst others held firm on last weeks levels, he said.
In the Tippy Small leaf catalogues FBOP1s held firm. Select best FBOPs were firm to dearer; best teas were irregularly lower, others were firm on last. Select best FBOPF1s sold at lower rates, whilst others held firm.
Except for a few select Western BOPFs which were about firm, others including below best and bottom were lower Rs. 20 to Rs. 40. Nuwara Eliya BOPs were sharply lower and difficult of sale, whilst their BOPFs were lower Rs. 20 to Rs. 40.
Udapussellawa BOP / BOPFs were a lower market by about Rs. 10 to Rs. 30. Clean Uva BOP / BOPFs were about firm; others were lower Rs. 10 to Rs. 20.
Record tea crop in Kenya has given a tough competition to Indian tea in the global markets in the second half of the year.
Indian teas have failed to maintain higher prices in the world market as Kenya is routing its higher produce in three key black tea markets  Europe, Pakistan and Egypt.
Prices of Indian teas in the global market which was higher by 10% in the first half of 2018, compared with H1of 2017, have come down significantly in the second half.
Indian tea production in the first nine months of 2018 stands at 941.18 million kg which is almost at par with last years production for the same period.

Engineer volunteers  to market machine
Following an article published in the Daily News about a student at the Thambuttegama Central College who had made several innovative equipment, including an aquatic weed harvester to collect water hyacinths spreading in tanks, an engineer had volunteered to assist the youth to sell his machines.
Hence, Ashoka Kumara of Kurana, Negombo, who is employed as a Project Engineer of a number of hotels in Negombo, promised to purchase the first aquatic weed harvester built by the 18-year-old inventor W.M. Harshaka Prabath Darmapala. He said he would find more buyers as well.
Kumara visited the youth at his residence, yesterday. He said the hotels that he was employed at were located near lagoons overrun by aquatic plants, and added that it was a hindrance to the tourism industry. He said that machines in the market cost more than Rs.9 million.
"As they were costly, I employed several people to remove the weeds, but it had also affected the industry as the workers were loitering," Kumara said, "Hence, when I read the article that appeared in the Daily News on October 31, I thought of meeting Darmapala."
The engineer said that the machine was relatively cheap and was meant for fresh water sources. He said that there were some modifications that were needed to be done before it could be used, and added that the young inventor was keen to make the required changes.
Darmapala's aquatic weed harvester could reach any part of the tank easily and collect 120 kilograms of water hyacinth in an hour. The machine can also store 30kg of water hyacinth and consumes only a half-a-litre of petrol per hour.
The student had also invented another machine to turn water hyacinths into compost. Furthermore, among his many other inventions is one that could protect houses from lightning strikes. Darmapala's Engineering Technology teacher is S.M. Nalinda Sampath.

An essential requirement
Sri Lanka has an impeccable record when it comes to debt servicing. The country has not defaulted on any repayments despite volatile global and local economic conditions on some occasions. With the recent change of Government, concerns have been expressed in certain quarters and also by the Opposition that the incoming Government might not be able to fulfill debt service requirements.
However, the Government has debunked these pessimistic projections and assured all lenders that it will repay the loans that will fall due during the financial year beginning January 1, 2019, on time. The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs in a statement said, the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL) has raised loans in terms of the provisions of the specific laws including the Registered Stock and Securities Ordinance, No. 7 of 1937, Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, No. 8 of 1923 and the Foreign Loans Act, No. 29 of 1957.
As such, any dues on such loans that may arise, in accordance with the respective terms and conditions attributed to such borrowings, can validly be charged on the Consolidated Fund as provided for, in the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and such specific laws as noted.
Therefore, the GOSL wishes to assure all lenders that all such dues will be met on the due dates as has been the time honoured tradition where we have maintained an unblemished track record of debt payments. Further we wish to note that this Ministry has been closely collaborating with the Central Bank to ensure that adequate buffers are created and maintained in view of the dues that will arise in 2019 specially the repayment of the International Sovereign Bond (ISB) amounting to US$ 1,500 million maturing during 2019.
This was rather reassuring, given the plethora of reports circulating in the traditional and social media that the Government would not be able to repay the loans this year. The Central Bank and the Treasury have assured the Cabinet that there was no threat to the repayment of process of the Government loans.
This follows a meeting and a presentation that Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy and Treasury Secretary Sajith Attygalle had with the Cabinet to assure the Cabinet that there were no fears of insecurity of the Governments repayment processes on the external debt. It was a praiseworthy move on the part of the Central Bank to engage in this presentation in the backdrop of apprehensions spread mainly by the Opposition.
Accordingly, the Central Bank Governor and the Treasury Secretary had debunked to the Cabinet the rumour mills doing the rounds which claimed that the Government was in difficulty in debt repayments following Rating Agency Moodys down degrading the rating on Sri Lanka. With reference to Moodys, the Central Bank said it is of the view that the decision by Moodys Investors Service on November 20, 2018 to downgrade the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) does not properly reflect the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals, and therefore unwarranted. The CBSL reiterated that Sri Lankas macroeconomic position has neither deteriorated nor has there been any policy slippage since Moodys last rating decision in July 2018, in spite of the recent developments in the countrys political sphere.
We have often heard the term debt trap in recent times, particularly with regard to loans granted by China. However, emerging economies such as Sri Lanka cannot finance many projects on their own and have to seek foreign loans. Since Sri Lanka is now classified as a Middle Income country, most OECD countries do not grant aid any longer. Hence we have to seek foreign loans, sometimes at commercial rates, to finance development projects. There are many ongoing and upcoming development projects that have to be financed through loans.
It is in this context that we should laud Chinese Ambassador in Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan for his statement that close cooperation between Sri Lanka and China has greatly contributed towards Sri Lankas development. He described Sri Lanka as one of the first countries to openly support and join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In the last five years, in-depth exchanges and cooperation in various fields has blossomed under the BRI framework.
The ambassador noted that the completion of the Norochcholai Power Station provided about 40% of the nations electricity supply, the Colombo Airport Expressway has brought great convenience to domestic and international travellers and the CICT has become the fastest growing container terminal in Asia. In fact, none of these projects would have been possible without Chinese assistance.
Speaking at the recent ASEAN meetings in Singapore, Chinese President Xi Jinping also hit out at critics for liberally using the term debt trap for its international assistance programme. He pointed out that the BRI would spur development in a host of nations that would otherwise lag behind in terms of development. The bottom line is that loans are essential for countries such as Sri Lanka seeking rapid development as long as the repayment process is handled well.

Full-Bench requested to hear  dissolution petitions - Gammanpila
Leader of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, Buddhasasana and Religious Affairs Minister Udaya Gammanpila said that he requested the Supreme Court to appoint a full-bench of judges to consider the petitions that have been filed against the dissolution of Parliament.
He said that the he would also file a defamation case against former Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake for insulting the Supreme Court.
Minister made these statements addressing media at his party office in Pitakotte yesterday.
Accusing the Speaker that he acted in a biased manner in the Parliament so far, he said that the Speaker had once again violated the Constitution by including a motion suspending the right of the Secretary to the Prime Minister to spend money under the expenditure head of the Prime Minister to the order paper for November 29.
Minister Gammanpila also accused Ven. Dambara Amila Thera of being a Non-Governmental activist. I have a doubt whether he is a disciple of the Buddha or of Ranil Wickremesinghe.
MP Ajith P. Perera at the recently held all party meeting stated that they could present affidavits of 113 MPs in support of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Not only that, he said that they would bring it by 10.00 a.m. next day. By now, five days have passed. There is no sight of bringing those affidavits. The truth is that the United National Party does not have the support of 113 MPs. Although, they said that they have 122 MPs with them, already two of them are with us. Then the number has decreased to 120.
According to him, the 14 TNA MPs and the six JVP MPs had stated that they would not support for resolutions that creates Prime Ministers. Therefore, the United National Party now has only 100 MPs with them. So, we tell them to think about securing 113 in their support despite the others issues, he added.
Speaking further about the motion that is to be moved on November 29 in Parliament to suspend the Prime Ministers expenditure head, he said that the Speaker could suspend the Standing Orders with the support of the MPs in parliament, but, nobody in this world could suspend the Constitution. He said that MP Anura Kumara stated that there are no ministers in parliament and only MPs are there. Then, he should tell us as to how that motion, which should be moved by a minister was presented in parliament by an MP, he stated.
Commenting on the Parliamentary Select Committee that is to be appointed, Gammanpila said that no Standing Order indicates the ratio of sharing of memberships of that committee between the government party and the Opposition.According to the prevailing tradition, the government party should have the majority, he said.
An adjournment motion would be presented in the parliament today. The United National Party is attempting to scare the President through letters.Those are their childish works.

November 25 is International day for the Elimination of Violence against Women
Hear me too
Violence against women and girls is one of the most widespread and devastating human rights violations currently. It also remains largely unreported due to the stigma and shame surrounding it.
Violence against women continues to be an obstacle to achieving equality, development and peace. In Sri Lanka, during the past few decades, communities both in the North and the East were exposed to several stresses, natural and man-made and the entire population was exposed to widespread trauma and losses to both human lives and infrastructure.
Mostly women were affected by the traumatic events and violence that occurred in such instances exposing them to grief and distress, as well as a variety of other psychological problems. This has left an impact, not only on the individual, but also on the family, community and society.
Adverse Impact
If the trauma and losses are not addressed, it can impact families and societies, causing changes at the family, community and societal levels. The detrimental repercussions of these events are visible in almost all aspects of trauma survivors lives; family relations, education, health, social identity, civic constructs, etc. The effects of traumatic incidents, such as frustration, feeling helpless, displacement, and loss of traditional roles, increase the incidents of psychosocial problems within the communities, Family Rehabilitaion Centres Clinical Psychologist, Anagi Gunasekara said.
She points out that according to the National Institute of Mental Health statistics, one out of five persons in Sri Lanka suffers from a mental health problem, out of which only 20 per cent receive services.
The consequences of trauma and problems created by the rapid change within communities, causes people psychological problems such as depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, sleep difficulties, emotional distress, suicide attempts, low self-esteem, prolonged grief due to bereavement, and demoralization. People who display such symptoms further suffer from social isolation, an inability to find work, loss of income and an inability to care for their children and family. Such conditions further increase issues like domestic violence, sexual abuse, alcohol addiction and the behavioral and emotional disturbance, Gunasekara explained.
Since its inception, Family Rehabilitation Centre has been committed to constantly assessing and improving the quality of services providing physical and psychological relief and rehabilitation, including livelihood support and basic needs to the victims of torture and trauma, while increasing its coverage.
Through FRC we are able to take measures to address peoples other needs such as medical treatment, legal services, vocational training etc. through the referral system while providing psychological assistance. We are mostly present in North and we have a minor presence Kalutara District. FRC currently implements two core programmes. The Trauma Rehabilitation Programme delivers services and implements activities, with the purpose of providing holistic treatment and care to those who have been affected by trauma. Under the Trauma Prevention Programme, FRC lobbies, decision makers, and decision making institutions and organizations, and conducts advocacy campaigns aimed at preventing trauma in Sri Lanka, Gunasekara added.
Tackling trauma
FRCs psychologist, Harithra Chandrasehar said FRC currently has offices established in the Colombo, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Jaffna, Manner and Vavuniya Districts in Sri Lanka, implementing long-term programmes to provide holistic treatment and care for those who have been affected by trauma, prevent trauma and increase capacity of different stake holders including communities on Mental Health and Psychosocial Services (MHPSS).
The Family Rehabilitation Centre (FRC) is a humanitarian, non-profit, non-governmental organization, registered in August 1992. It is an independent organization with its own Memorandum and Articles of Association and is incorporated under Section 21 of the Companies Act No. 17 of 1982. Through the organization we hope to effectively address and prevent trauma in Sri Lanka. Using this vision and broad framework, FRC is focusing its work on three specific spheres in the psychosocial field: Rehabilitation for trauma survivors, prevention of trauma and (re) victimization of trauma survivors and capacity building for relevant stakeholders, Chandrasehar explained.
She added that their services are offered to survivors of gender based violence, survivors of domestic violence, sexual violence, trauma survivors, torture victims, widows and widowers affected by trauma, internally displaced persons affected by war, migrant workers affected by trauma, survivors of natural disasters, women and men who have been disabled as a result of trauma.
We offer them counseling and psychosocial support and raise awareness on psychosocial wellbeing, training and capacity building and advocacy. In Sri Lanka, the impact of facing mental health problems is exacerbated by social and cultural norms that deter survivors of trauma from openly discussing their condition or seeking treatment due to stigmatization. Vulnerable communities need greater awareness about trauma, causes of trauma, psychological/ behavioural changes due to trauma and services available to them. Lack of resources and expertise in treating people affected by trauma, limited awareness about mental health issues prevalent in communities and lack of livelihood opportunities are the constrains that need to be overcome to ensure holistic care, she added.
Forum Theatre Performances
Chandrasehar said that the organization had the first phase of its walk `Path to Healing to raise awareness on mental wellbeing. The first phase was from Mannar to Vavuniya and the next will take place early February from Vavuniya to Mulativ while the final phase will be from Mulativ to Jaffna end of next year, she said.
Meanwhile FRC in collaboration with the Legal Aid Commission of Sri Lanka and Act4: Theatre for Change conducted several forum theatre performances in the North Central and Eastern provinces.
The performances are part of an innovative approach to creating community awareness on the legal rights and responsibilities of citizens in upholding human dignity, and the need for rehabilitating survivors of trauma. The significant number of participants at the performances included local residents of communities in the areas as well as civil society representatives and representatives from the Human Rights Commission and The Legal Aid Commission. It was encouraging to note the enthusiasm and appreciation of participants in all locations at which the performances took place, Chandrasehar added.Global Action: Orange the World
United Nation (UN) has designated the 25th of every month as Orange Day by the UN Women campaign Say No, UNiTE launched in 2009 to mobilize civil society, activists, governments and the UN system in order amplify the impact of the UN Secretary-Generals campaign, UNiTE to End Violence against Women. Participants the world over are encouraged to wear a touch of orange in solidarity with the cause - the colour symbolizes a brighter future and a world free from violence against women and girls.This year, the International day for the Elimination of Violence against Women will be on November 25, and the theme is Orange the World: #HearMeToo and like previous editions, the date marks the launch of 16 days of activism that will conclude on December 10, International Human Rights Day.
A host of public events are being coordinated, among which iconic buildings and landmarks will be oranged to recall the need for a violence-free future.
UN says the adverse psychological, sexual and reproductive health consequences of violence against women and children, affect women at all stages of their life. For example, early-set educational disadvantages not only represent the primary obstacle to universal schooling and the right to education for girls; down the line they are also to blame for restricting access to higher education and even translate into limited opportunities for women in the labour market.
While gender-based violence can happen to anyone, anywhere, some women and girls are particularly vulnerable - for instance, young girls and older women, women who identify as lesbian, bisexual, transgender or intersex, migrants and refugees, indigenous women and ethnic minorities, or women and girls living with HIV and disabilities, and those living through humanitarian crises.

Heavy rains unearth Iraqi mines in Kuwaiti desert
KUWAIT: Unprecedented heavy rains which recently lashed Kuwait unearthed dozens of land mines planted by Iraqi troops during their 1990-91 occupation, disrupting the emirates popular desert camping season, officials said Wednesday.
Authorities have closed 18 desert sites and have so far removed at least 48 mines after receiving complaints from the campers, they said.
The civil defence committee has urged campers to delay their plans until after the defence ministry has searched the areas, said Fahad al-Shutaily, deputy director of Kuwaits Jahra and Farwaniya governorates.
Floods have uncovered and carried away scores of mines, bombs and ammunition left by the Iraqi army in desert areas. We are waiting for the defence ministry to hand over the areas after clearing them, Shutaily told AFP.
The ministry of defence is currently searching at least 18 sites which are normally used for camping.
Iraqi troops, under former president Saddam Hussein, invaded and occupied Kuwait on August 2, 1990 before they were evicted seven months later by a US-led international coalition.
But before that, Kuwaiti authorities say Iraqis planted some two million mines mostly in the desert.
Through multi-billion dollar contracts, Kuwait removed some 1.65 million mines, leaving behind 350,000 others.
Since early November the desert state of Kuwait has received about 300 mm of rain -- almost three times its annual average rainfall -- which has caused widespread damage to residential zones.
The flooding of desert areas has come at the start of the camping season, when hundreds of thousands of Kuwaitis set up modern camps for around four months.
After waiting to enjoy the beautiful and usually uninhabited desert areas, some campers are refusing to heed the warnings.
A majority of my relatives and neighbours are camping, Yousef Abdullah told AFP.
No one is backing down because of fear from mines... We impatiently wait for the camping season, he added.
Shutaily however said that over the past two days, authorities have removed 36 camps and warned 60 others. - AFP

HUAWEI Introduces Mate 20 Series in Sri Lanka
HUAWEI introduced the worlds first 7 Nano meter process; Kirin 980 to Sri Lanka at an exclusive preview held recently at the Huawei Head Office in World Trade Center, Colombo.
Commenting on the occasion, Peter Liuyi, Country Head Huawei Device Sri Lanka added, Leading the trend as usual, just within a few months of launching the nova3 series, HUAWEI recently launched the Mate 20 series in London with the Kirin 980, a high performance mobile AI chipset fabricated on a 7nm process. This chipset is the worlds first dual NPU design, and the worlds first chip to support LTE Cat.21, providing users with impressive mobile performance. The Huawei Mate 20 series is the first product series to bring this innovation. The Huawei Mate 20 series has already inspired the international market, and we believe that Sri Lankans will be excited to use the Mate 20 series due to its best-in-class performance, efficiency and connectivity features. 
With this introduction of 7nm technology to the Kirin 980, the chipset performs with improved processor speed by approximately 20 percent and consume approximately 40 percent less power compared to the 10nm Chipset. The efficient performance of the chipset is driven by the faster switching transistors and the power efficiency is complimented with these features, due to lower resistance and a lower requirement of current for switching the transistors. To add to the many benefits of a denser chip, due to the less power the chip generates, less heat will be generated from the device. Alternatively, a smaller chip can enable the designers to embed more exciting new features such as AI processors, ISPs and DSPs, and flaunt its features. So introducing the latest 7nm Chipset has enabled the designers to give users an efficient, power saving and smooth experience integrated with improved and exciting features.
In addition, The Kirin 980 integrates 6.9 billion transistors in an area of less than 1 square centimeter which is a 1.6x fold increase in density to empower better performance. The Kirin 980 also includes the worlds first commercial use GPU Mali-G76 MP10 with an improvement in performance of 46%. The LPDDR4X memory operates at speeds up to 2133 MHz. The fourth-generation ISP utilizes a multi-pass noise reduction to capture quality images and preserve important details. This ISP also has a dedicated video pipeline to effectively improve video clarity and reduce shooting delays by 33%.
Huawei has made over 50 million smartphone shipments in 2018 with a strong number 2 position in the global smartphone market.
In Sri Lanka, HUAWEI has succeeded in securing the number one position in Smartphone sales according to GfK reports.
And Poised as the most preferred Smartphone brand among Sri Lankan consumers, HUAWEI aims to enhance the lifestyle of all consumers by offering the best quality state of the art smart phones at an attractive price.

Headline inflation as measured by the year-on-year change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100)1 continued to decline for the third consecutive month, recording 0.1 per cent in October 2018, the lowest since January 2016.
The deceleration observed in year-on-year inflation in October 2018 is mainly driven by the higher base prevailed during the corresponding month of the previous year due to higher food prices. Year-on-year Food inflation dropped for the third consecutive month and recorded -6.6 per cent in October 2018. However, year-on-year Non-food inflation continued to increase and reached 5.8 per cent during the month.
The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased to 3.3 per cent in October 2018 from 4 per cent in September 2018.
The month on month change of the NCPI increased by 0.4 per cent in October 2018 due to increase in the prices of the items in the Non-food category particularly that of transport (petrol, diesel, bus fare and train fare) and miscellaneous goods and services sub categories. Meanwhile, prices of the items in the Food category declined during the month where prominent price declines were observed in fresh fish, eggs and coconuts.
The core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, increased to 3.4 percent in October 2018 from 3.1 per cent in September2018 on year -on-year basis. Meanwhile, annual average core inflation remained unchanged at 2.4 per cent in October 2018.

Janashakthi Insurance appoints  new Chairman, Board Members
Janashakthi Insurance PLC announced the appointment of renowned business leader Prakash Schaffter as its Executive Chairman.
Schaffter, who has three decades of experience in the Insurance industry, had led Janashakthi as its Managing Director since 2006.
This announcement comes with the addition of two new board members, Nathan Sivagananathan and Avindra Rodrigo. These appointments, which are subject to regulatory approval, came as Husein Esufally and Anushya Coomaraswamy stepped down from their roles of Chairman and Director of the Board respectively.
Esufally took on the mantle as the Chairman of Janashakthi Insurance PLC in 2016. He was a key driver of the Companys post-segregation strategy and played an important role in the acquisition of AIA General.
He was instrumental in bringing specialised focus to the Life and General Insurance categories with the appointment of dedicated Chief Executive Officers to head each business. He also saw the Company through the recent divestment of Janashakthi General Insurance Limited, one of the largest transactions in not only the Insurance industry, but the entire corporate sector.
As a member of the Board of Directors of Janashakthi Insurance PLC since 2006, Coomaraswamy has been known for her technical expertise in Finance and Accounting, as well as her strategic contribution and leadership to the Board Audit Committee and the Related Party Transactions Review Committee.
While we bid adieu to Esufally and Coomaraswamy, we thank them for their leadership, support and guidance to the Janashakthi business. Their experience and contribution have helped place Janashakthi well on our journey of becoming one of the key players in the Life Insurance industry. I am pleased to welcome Nathan Sivagananathan and Avindra Rodrigo to the Board of Directors of Janashakthi Insurance, and I am confident that their expertise will add greatly to the strategic growth journey of our Life Insurance business, said Prakash Schaffter, Chairman of Janashakthi Insurance PLC.
In addition to the three decades of invaluable industry experience which Schaffter brings in, the company believes that the diverse experience and skills of the new appointees to the board will strengthen its efforts of building a specialised Life Insurance business.
Under Schaffters leadership, the Company became the countrys third largest insurer, acquired AIAs General Insurance business, and most recently engaged in the divestment of Janashakthis Non Life segment.

## Title: JVP, shame  on you!

JVP, shame  on you!
As one of the most dynamic and deeply rooted smaller political movements in Sri Lanka, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is in the middle of a deep internal political crisis right now. It started with the unexpected ousting of Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister last week and appointing former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to the position of premier.
Since the August 2015 parliamentary election the political arena had been shaped by the coalition between the United National Party (UNP) and the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP). The most important thing in these political parties is the historical rivalry. Therefore, it is not a secret to any political analyst that there were serious differences on policy issues between President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe since the end of the honeymoon period of first 100 days of Unity Government formed in 2015. Indeed, this serious conflict reached its peak and was revealed to the whole world on October 26, 2018.
Then, the JVP becomes extremely busy backing the opposition move for a vote of no-confidence motion against current Premier Mahinda Rajapaksa. It is indeed ironical, in Sri Lankas political history, the UNP and the JVP to come together to share a common political platform.
Parliamentary democracy
The JVP, a party which claims to be the champion of parliamentary democracy - the cause of Parliamentary tradition and norms, Standing Orders, the Constitution and Law and Order has breached the same norms through its present behaviour aimed at protecting the class enemy, the UNP, its leader former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and his elitist political gang.
On the one hand, many JVP grass roots level cadres led by popular Trade Union Activist, Lal Kantha reportedly expressed their vehement opposition to extending any support to the UNP or its leader. However, the JVP parliamentary leaders including Anura Kumara Dissanayake, Vijitha Herath and few others said they would join with the UNP to defeat the government. However they would not associate with the UNP to form a Government. Although the JVP brought the No Confidence Motion against the new administration of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, its Propaganda Secretary Vijitha Herath noted that there is false news that the JVP is supporting Ranil Wickremesinghe. However, he defended the No Confidence Motion by stating that the current move by President Sirisena was unconstitutional and undemocratic and also against morality.
However, the JVP reiterated that it would never help the UNP to form a government. These diverse positions amply display the duplicity of the JVP policy.
It is sad to see the JVP losing its strength among the youth due to these double standards, because it has served a purpose in Parliament as the main socialist party in the country. The committed JVP cadres lament that the party that had adhered to the original JVP principles is being hoodwinked by the UNP again and again.
Nevertheless, after January 8, 2015, Sri Lanka has a democratic government. At the moment, indeed, good governance (yahapalana) government, is facing midlife crises. Considering the current political situation anyone would say we need a general election to elect a new Parliament. The JVP points out that the reasons given by government for its decision to go for a general election is not genuine.
Second insurrection of 1988-89
Although people are quite happy about the role played by the JVP as a Parliamentary party, they have not forgotten its recorded history of blood- shed. The first insurrection of the JVP in 1971 had claimed the lives of 8,000 to 10,000 people, mostly youths. The government at that time estimated that the cost of the damages caused by the 1971 insurrection amounted to over Rs 20 million. The second insurrection of 1988-89 claimed over 50,000 lives and massive losses of property.
Even in fatal situations, the people acknowledged and admired the commitment of the JVP and the honesty of its leaders. However, one thing is clear today, the so-called dynamic and deeply rooted political party in Sri Lanka, the JVP is acting today on short term expediencies. This is in contrast to the JVP policies. In the early days of the JVP, it had a very clear vision. According to Shyamon Jayasinghes analysis in the Colombo Telegraph, the most important thing is that the JVP had a clear and unambiguous eventual goal, to which it had been working under the leadership of Rohana Wijeweera, Gamanayake etc. (Colombo Telegraph, March, 28, 2018)
Nowadays, many scholars argue that the major crisis of the JVP is that it has lost their own purpose. They have now aligned themselves with one of the major political parties for self gain. This policy cannot be attractive to its cadres and they will find it difficult to attract new members to the party. At this stage, JVP is going to find it hard to be the third political force in the country in the future political context.
The JVP was a major actor in the prevailing turbulence situation in parliament over the last three weeks. Finally, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna should understand its responsibilities towards democracy and the fact that creating chaos is not democracy.

Kalhari wins Gold Award for Recycling
Kalhari Group won the Gold Award for Recycled Products at the recently held NCE Export Awards 2018.
The company which has consistently won NCE Awards over more than ten years is today a leader in the field of exporting recycled products to various countries around the world. This is also the first time the National Chamber of Exporters introduced a Gold Award for Recycled Products.
I owe this award to my team. They have been with me and have worked hard to bring this success to Kalhari, Chairman / Managing Director, Indhra Kaushal Rajapaksa said. This is the tenth award we have won at the NCE National Export Awards.
The Kalhari Group which exports recycled tyre waste, rubber waste, post-consumer PET bottles and steel dust, has factories in Sapugaskanda, Mahara and Minuwangoda while its head office is in the rural village of Heiyantuduwa.
We commenced operations in 2003 and have come a long way, said Rajapaksa. He has steered Kalhari towards greater success each year, consolidating and expanding to newer fields while developing the community around the village of Heiyantuduwa which provides eighty percent of the workforce.
The Kalhari Group has exported significant quantities of recycled material to five countries including Thailand and Pakistan. The company has made a major impact on controlling environmental pollution and waste management in Sri Lanka and enjoys the confidence of key regulatory bodies.
Rajapaksa is also a Director of Building-A-Future Foundation, an organisation dedicated to the training of youth in ocean-based activities. He is in addition a Director of the SailLanka Yachting Group, the leading yacht manufacturing and chartering group of companies in Sri Lanka.
Kaushal Rajapaksa was twice the recipient of the Asia Pacific Entrepreneurship Award. In 2014, Rajapaksa received the prestigious Merit Award from the Plastic and Rubber Institute of Sri Lanka for his significant contribution towards the development and growth of the countrys Polymer Industry.
Rajapaksa is a widely respected industrialist and holds several posts of responsibility in industrial bodies. He is the Vice President of the Plastics and Rubber Institute, Vice President of the Chartered Institute of Management UK-Sri Lanka Branch, Chairman of the Minuwangoda Industrial Estate, Management Committee Member of the National Chamber of Exporters and also Executive Committee Member of the Institute of Environmental Professionals - Sri Lanka.
As an active member of Lions District 306 B2 he is currently the Chairman of the Environment Committee. Kaushal Rajapaksa not only contributes to the community but also encourages his staff to share their success generously with others. Last year, he organised awareness seminars for 2000 students with the help of The Institute of Environmental Professionals and the Lions District B2. These seminars were held in Biyagama, Gampaha, Kurunegala and Anuradhapura. He also plans to distribute Jak plants following an MOU to be signed this year with the Hadabima Authority under the Ministry of Agriculture.
Our main export product is tyre waste, a large amount of which is produced in the tyre rebuilding industry. In Japan, Australia and New Zealand, they use this tyre dust to make artificial green playing fields as well as rubber floor tiles, Rajapaksa explained. Pakistan produces oil from tyres. They also make shoe soles. Thailand produces solid tyres and conveyor belts. The Chairman of the Kalhari Group says that they export Sri Lankas waste material for which they earn valuable foreign exchange.
My knowledge is readily available to anyone who wishes to grow as an entrepreneur in the field of recycling. We need more and more small and medium entrepreneurs. I am keen to change attitudes in Sri Lanka and am interested in diversifying only into areas that directly benefit the community.
Recycling should be the responsibility of the producer and we need to create more awareness on the disposal of plastic and rubber products by implementing EPR  Extended Producer Responsibility which will enable Sri Lanka to address the waste disposal and management problem to a great extent. We are planning to build up partnerships in the provinces to expand the recycling industry and also educate the public on the responsible disposal of waste. We are very grateful to the government authorities for the assistance given so far, and look forward to working with them even more closely in the future. This award is for them too, Kaushal Rajapaksa added.

Lanka looking down the barrel at a 3-0 whitewash
Lakmal blames spinners for defeats when batsmen have failed
In the first two Tests of the ongoing three-Test series it is clear as day that it is the Sri Lankan batting that has been the downfall of the team who find themselves trailing 0-2 in the series and having a fight on their hands to prevent England from completing a 3-0 whitewash by winning the third and final Test starting at the SSC grounds from today.
However acting captain Suranga Lakmal was of the view that it was the spinners who had contributed largely to the two defeats.
When weve play in Sri Lanka, our strength has been our spinners. Unfortunately in the last two games we didnt get as many wickets from the spinners as quickly as we expected. The England batsmen played them really well. If we had bowled a little better we would have been able to win those two Tests. Everyone tries to stick to their strengths playing at home and for us it is our spinners, said Lakmal at the pre-match press conference held at the SSC yesterday.
When it was pointed out that Sri Lanka had passed 300 only once in the series and no batsmen had so far scored a hundred against Englands three, Lakmal replied: Our batsmen are a little low in confidence at the moment. The England batsmen are playing really well. If you look at the world, the next best players of spin after India are England. Although we didnt get 20 wickets, I thought our spinners bowled okay. As a captain I am satisfied with their efforts.
Their batsmen dont let our spinners bowl in one spot to them. They sweep in both directions - the normal sweep and the reverse. They do that from the first ball of their innings. Thats something we should learn from when we play in Sri Lanka in the future. Weve lost two games, but were in a good mental state to somehow win this match.
Like in the previous two Tests, Lakmal said that they had requested for a pitch that favours spin.
However in this spin dominated series it is the England batters who have held the upperhand outscoring the home teams batsmen who are renowned to play spin, but in this series are nowhere close to emulating their opponents.
In both Tests Sri Lanka had removed the England top order cheaply only to be frustrated by their lower order who has contributed to their match winning totals.
In Pallekele there was a dropped catch, and if we had taken that the match could really have changed. Their last three batsmen in both games were able to contribute to partnerships worth over 100 runs. Were trying to stop that in this game, said Lakmal.
Their top five are always trying to score runs quickly. After that they start to understand the pitch and start playing the spinners better. They also have a good batting line up. We cant be making spinning pitches and letting their tail get runs. In the last two matches their final five scored about 250 - so in this match were trying to change that,
KUSAL MENDIS FORM
The value of persisting with Kusal Mendis as a batsman despite his continued failures came into question. In his last 10 innings for his country in Tests and ODIs his contribution has been 117 runs from 10 innings which includes three ducks and a top score of 45. He has got out to the left-arm spin of Jack Leach on all four occasions in the series.
In the last few years when weve won Tests, hes a player who has contributed to those performances in a big way. As a captain, Kusal is definitely in my team. Dinesh Chandimal is out, and a lot of the batsmen dont have a lot of experience. He was among the runs until recently - its only in the last six or seven games that hes failed, pointed out Lakmal.
Hell play in this game, because the next tours are important as well. Were going to New Zealand soon. We cant drop him for this match and bring him back for that game, because then he will fall down even more mentally. What were looking to do is to try to carry the players who arent performing and try and get them into a better frame of mind. Mendis is a valuable player for now and in the future, he said.
Following Rangana Heraths retirement from cricket at the end of the Galle Test, Sri Lanka find themselves without another wicket-taking spinner for this Test Akila Dananjaya who has gone to Brisbane to have his bowling action assessed after being reported. Dananjaya took a career best 6/115 in Englands second innings of the Pallekele Test.
Were missing Rangana Herath and Akila Dananjaya. They are the ones who bowled really well in the last three or four matches. Thats a big loss, but weve got two options (uncapped) Nishan Pieris and Lakshan Sandakan. Itll be between those two, said Lakmal.
Sri Lanka have also brought in opener Danushka Gunathilaka who probably will replace Kaushal Silva whos had a poor series so far with scores of 1, 30, 6 and 4. Gunathilakas advantage as a spinner gives him an edge.

Lankan Parliament not  bound to follow House of  Commons tradition - Minister
Media Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera yesterday said former Minister and UNP member Lakshman Kiriella seems to be living in the pre-1972 era and has forgotten history.
Minister Jayasekera was expressing his views on the recent comments made by Kiriella that Sri Lankan Parliament was bound to follow the tradition of House of Commons of the UK when the Sri Lankan Constitution is unclear about certain situations.
Minister Jayasekera noted that in 1972, the new Republican Constitution, declared Sri Lanka a Republic and the monarchy abolished.
In 1978, the Second Amendment to the Constitution moved from a Westminster system into a Presidential system with the President serving as both Head of State and head of government.
Minister Jayasekera speaking at the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department said Kiriella seems to have forgotten history and that the country has been governed by an Executive President since 1978.
In lighter vein, the minister said Kiriella was a politician who likes to live in the past rather than the present.
Local media reported Kiriella as saying that the House was bound to follow Section 7 of Parliament Powers and Privileges Act where it said the House was bound to follow the tradition of the House of Commons when the local constitution was unclear on certain situations. He was referring to the appointment of a new Prime Minister by the President.

Mannar from heaven!
Juliet Coombe explores the mysterious South Eastern Mannar coastline for the truth about the legendary much talked about Adams Bridge to India and to see the fading grandeur of Mannar colonial fort.
The helicopter blades whirled around and suddenly we were off to explore the island and to see Mannar Fort, once a pivotal military spot and today a fantastic spot to see marine life. An ethereal historic place with a chain of random sandbanks and tiny islands, that can be crossed on foot at low tide and has been used as a bridge for thousands of years. The greatest legend of all about it is that the first man Adam to cross by foot from India to Sri Lanka used it, and on this famous trip he visited the now named site Adams Peak, where he left his giant footprint.
The bridge explained one of the old fishing guys is also known as Ramas Bridge as it is talked about in the Sanskrit Epic Ramayana, where it is said that the bridge was built by the Vanara, and an army of powerful men, when they came to Sri Lanka in search of his wife Sita. Spanning a distance of 48km and with waters as shallow as 3ft in places and 30ft deep at others, they say the bridge can be crossed at low tide as some of the shoals are compounded enough sand banks to do so, but I am yet to find anyone in recent times that will have a go. However old, or whatever the legend about it, the bridge is a spectacular sight when viewed from the air in a helicopter or thirty-seater plane.
A bridge that leads to the gargantuan Baobab tree, like an elephants mammoth foot stuck in the landscape welcoming all those that come to visit the colonial fort town of Mannar. A fascinating often-hollow tree in the middle where stories of mythical creatures live is told by island story tellers and the local fisherman say was planted by visiting Arab traders hundreds of years ago at the height of the Golden Age of trade. The tree appears out of the deserted landscape like a giant dwarf, gnarled and monstrous in form, that even when three people join hands you cant put your arms around its circumference. Mannar even now is a lost world of hang mans nooses and a once grand colonial fort, now only occupied by a bunch of rather frisky donkeys and the howling winds of time.
Mannar is still only for the truly adventurous traveller, a time locked trinket, a Machu Picchu, a true lost city, a wonderful settlement hidden courtyards, cabanas and occasional banana or coconut tree breaking the idyllic historic views of fishing life today. One wonders how such an important building was created in such a challenging spot and what life must have been like living inside its ancient walls.
The action in Mannar centres around the busy old harbour, both broken and ravaged by time, tinged with the violent repose of man. Can hope, however dissolute, exist in these scenes one wonders as one moves between the boxes of fish to the colorfully entangled nets Here you can meet the local fisherman all characters in their own right and view the hardy ones waist deep near their moored boats hanging out nets to the stick poles high corners. Inside the stone decked fishery atop a brick laden hull of a building you will find the days catch for sale, even some that are illegal to trawl in other parts of the world. The master fisherman has frazzled white curled hair, white long sleeves rolled at the elbows and a gold chain; a bluish green towel turban covers his hair.
The area is it seems always full of crows in pensive sance, their black long fish tailed coats perched on the boats wooden boudoir like a scene out of Alfred Hitchcocks film The Birds with letters from the Tamil dialect flecking the yellow signage on starboard side. Its hard not to be awe struck by the manta ray and blue flecked crabs for sale in the early morning sun dripping ice in all directions, which look so delicious it brings on a desire to try these fishy delicacies raw.
Desolate braying donkeys lead me from the fishy fish market to the majestic abandoned Portuguese fort, where they have turned this magnificent spot into their nightly stable. The fort has four bastions and as you enter the original gate a sense of wonder creeps in and surprise as you discover the original gallows still stands on the main bastion, complete with rope and the wood groans as the beam sways in the wind. The donkeys trot along the ramparts enjoying the scenic sea views, oblivious of its colorful past.
The Fort walls vary in size and stature, and a passing coconut seller tells me it was built with African slaves in 1696. On October 5, 1795 the Dutch finally surrendered this stoic garrison to the British, who used it for military purposes during the first and Second World War. It was militarised until 1948, when the country finally received independence from the British. Looking out from the walls across the ocean where the legendary Adams Bridge Lies and back past the thick octopus like tree trunks deeply intertwined into the ancient citadel historic walls, it is easy to see why people fought so hard for this heavenly spot. A place rich in fishing bounty and raw natural beauty one half expects to find a Harry Potter movie being shot. It is a hypnotic spot full of mystical charm with its crazy giant size tree, majestic stone fort and old school harbour.

Meghan returns to Grenfell kitchen
UK: The pregnant Duchess of Sussex made an emotional return visit to a community kitchen which inspired her collaborative work on a Grenfell Tower charity cookbook, telling the women: I'm so proud of you.
Meghan went to the Hubb Community Kitchen, not far from the site of the deadly tower block blaze in West London, to see first hand the progress made since the Together cookbook went on sale in September.
The mother-to-be was greeted warmly by kitchen co-ordinator Zaheera Sufyaan - whom she gave a big hug - and Abdurahman Sayed, chief executive of the Al Manaar Muslim Cultural Centre in North Kensington.
Meghan, who has been making private visits to the kitchen since January, quickly abandoned any formality when she got inside. She threw her arms around each of the women and kissed them, chattering excitedly about what they had been up to since she last saw them. Hi, how are you Wow, it's so quiet in here, she said, giggling.
Wearing a burgundy dress and coat by Club Monaco, a Canadian company now owned by US fashion giant Polo Ralph Lauren, Meghan soon put on an apron, rolled up her sleeves and got stuck into helping prepare food.
She said to a group of women: It starts from one idea and from this one idea starts so much. I'm so proud of you.
The book - full title Together: Our Community Cookbook - took the number one spot on Amazon within hours of being unveiled two months ago and has since sold nearly 40,000 copies in the UK, raising 210,000.
Bumper sales of the cookbook, which features more than 50 recipes from women whose community was affected by the fire, have allowed a total makeover of the kitchen as well as longer opening hours.
Meghan, who suggested the idea of a fundraising cookbook when she first met the women, has previously described it as a tremendous labour of love'.
The kitchen, redesigned with the women's input to capture its spirit as a place for the community to come together over meals, now opens seven days a week, up from just two when it began last year.
Those involved have also been able to obtain food hygiene qualifications and been empowered to start their own projects for the benefit of the wider community.
Projects, supported by the social entrepreneur foundation UnLtd, include a group for women affected by domestic violence, a scheme to deliver freshly cooked meals for women on maternity wards, and a project to produce healthy treats for children.
Today, 200 meals being prepared in the kitchen were destined for local groups, including elderly people's homes, homeless shelters and women's refuges. The dishes include Egyptian lamb fattah, Persian chicken and barberry rice.
The meals she helped prepare today included rainbow roasted vegetables, a recipe in the book from Ahlam Saeid, an Iraqi chemist, who stood chatting to the Duchess as she mixed the vegetables.
Meghan drank ginger tea as she spoke to some of the women who have been motivated to go on and develop further projects including making healthy snacks for children, and preparing food for the homeless.
She also introduced chef Clare Smyth, a friend of hers, to the volunteers in the kitchen. Smiling, Meghan said: I'm so proud of you. It's really exciting.
The people involved in the kitchen are incredible, said Ms Smyth, who visited the kitchen for the first time with Meghan.

Mominul, Gabriel shine on day one of Bangladesh Test
Chittagong, Thursday: Shannon Gabriel took four wickets in three overs after Mominul Haque slammed a century on the opening day of the first Test between Bangladesh and West Indies in Chittagong on Thursday.
Bangladesh reached 315 for eight at stumps, thanks to Mominuls 120 off 167 balls -- his eighth Test hundred. He now shares the record with Tamim Iqbal for scoring the most Test centuries for Bangladesh.
It was his fourth century this year -- only Indias Virat Kohli has scored as many Test centuries in 2018 so far.
Gabriel ended Mominuls record innings after the tea break to finish with 4-69 in a devastating spell that also included the prized wickets of Shakib Al Hasan (34), Mushfiqur Rahim (four) and Mahmudullah Riyad (three).
Electing to bat first, Bangladesh seemed to be coasting towards a big total once Mominul brought his hundred with a six and four in successive overs before the tea break.
But Gabriel struck back in the final session. He first had Mominul caught behind before successfully reviewing a not out leg-before decision against Mushfiqur Rahim in the same over.
In his next two overs, Gabriel bowled Mahmudullah and Shakib respectively to leave Bangladesh reeling on 235 for seven, from a solid 222 for three.
Left-arm spinner Jomel Warrican bowled Mehidy Hasan for 22 to pile misery on Bangladesh, before the tail-enders restored some parity.
Taijul Islam and teenage debutant Nayeem Hasan added 56 runs for the unbroken ninth-wicket stand, guiding Bangladesh past the 300-run mark.
Taijul -- who was reprieved twice by the third umpire -- was unbeaten on 32 while Nayeem was 24 not out when bad light brought early stumps.
Mominul, who hit 10 fours and a six, dominated the opening two sessions to complete his third century in consecutive innings at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury Stadium.
He helped steady Bangladeshs innings after pace bowler Kemar Roach struck in the first over of the morning, dismissing opening batsman Soumya Sarkar for a duck.
Mominul shared 104 runs with Imrul Kayes for the second wicket and another 48 runs with Mohammad Mithun for the third.
Leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo dismissed Mithun for 20 to give West Indies their only success of the second session.

No intention to deviate from  fiscal  discipline - NEC SG
National Economic Council (NEC) Secretary General Prof. Lalith Samarakoon reiterated that there is no question about Sri Lankas capacity as well as willingness to service its debt obligations on time.
There is no intention to deviate from our fiscal discipline either which we have agreed with the financial institutions in our medium term framework.
If there are minor deviations with respect to revenue shortfall or increase in expenditure we will be able to come up with counter balancing adjustments to maintain the target, he told the media yesterday.
Samarakoon stressed that Sri Lankas commitment to service debt obligations as well as the capacity as well as fiscal discipline will stay without change and will be strong.
Samarakoon was commenting about Moody's Investors Service downgrading the Government of Sri Lanka's foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) on November 20.
Speaking to the media at the Government Information Department, Prof.Samarakoon said he and the Central Bank Governor and the Finance and Economic Development Ministry Secretary had briefed the Cabinet of Ministers about the countrys economic situation.
Prof.Samarakoon went on to say that Moodys decision to downgrade Sri Lanka is primarily based on two factors. The first is the tightening of financial conditions worldwide with US treasury expected to increase interest rates in December.There is an idea the financial situation outside Sri Lanka can become more tighter and Moodys believe when this happens Sri Lanka will face challenges when raising funds outside to meet the debt requirement.
Second is the slower pace of fiscal consolidation he added.
We have more than adequate capacity to pay our debt obligations.We have sovereign bonds which are maturing next year to the tune of 1.5 billion USD. We already have 650 million USD remaining from the Hambantota Port transaction lying in the treasury accounts.
The CBSL and the Finance Ministry are working to raise up to one billion USD by way of investing in Sri Lanka development bonds through the People's Bank, Bank of Ceylon and National Savings Bank.
In addition we plan to raise 500 million USD by way of bonds issued to the China Development Bank. These are only a few initiatives. We have in excess of 2 billion USD that are clearly available over the next few months.
Therefore there is no question whatsoever about our ability to service 1.5 billion USD sovereign bonds which are outstanding he added.
He also said the Central Bank has initiated negotiations with Central Banks of friendly nations with regard to obtaining foreign currency SWAP facilities of sizeable amounts. These measures will further strengthen the country's foreign reserve adequacy, and would enable timely servicing of external obligations he added.
Prof.Samarakoon revealed that it was in last July that the Moodys had informed their intention to the Central bank. According to the Professor, Moodys main concerns were high external risk, balance of payment, low economic growth and high political risk.
He said the macro economic imbalances in the country had not developed overnight and were the result of long term effects.
Prof.Samarakoon went on to point out that the countrys debt had grown 49 percent from 2014 and debt which was Rs.7,391 billion in 2014 had risen to Rs.10,994 billion at present. He said the budget deficit too had grown since 2014 and the economic growth was one of the lowest after several years in 2017 and 2018.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said some UNP members led by former Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera were trying to create a bleak picture on the countrys economy to the international community to gain petty political mileage.
Minister Samarasinghe said the UNP was trying to spread canards in order to curtail foreign investments and tarnish the countrys reputation.

Pakistan takes rare credit for  helping U.S. kill al-Qaida Chief
PAKISTAN: Pakistan summoned Tuesday the top U.S. diplomat in the country to formally protest President Donald Trumps allegations that Islamabad had sheltered al-Qaida chief Osama bin Laden, despite receiving billions of dollars in U.S. assistance.
Foreign Secretary Tehmina Janjua told American charge daffairs Paul Jones that Trumps baseless rhetoric and unsubstantiated allegations were totally unacceptable for her country, according to a foreign ministry statement issued after the meeting.
Rejecting the insinuations about OBL (Osama bin Laden), Foreign Secretary (Janjua) reminded the U.S. CdA (charge daffairs) that it was Pakistans intelligence cooperation that provided the initial evidence to trace the whereabouts of OBL, the statement noted.
This is the first time Pakistan has publicly admitted it had played a role in helping the U.S. locate and kill bin Laden in 2011 during a night helicopter raid on his hideout not far from the countrys prime military training academy in Abbottabad.
Until now, Pakistani leaders have insisted state security institutions were unaware of bin Ladens presence in the country and complained Washington conducted the unilateral raid without informing Islamabad.
Janjua stopped short of warning Trumps tirade against Pakistan would undermine bilateral working with the U.S. in coordination with regional stakeholders to seek a politically negotiated end to the prolonged conflict in Afghanistan. At this critical juncture, baseless allegations about a closed chapter of history could seriously undermine this vital cooperation, she said.
The United States has recently opened direct talks with Taliban officials based in Qatar to try to begin an Afghan peace process. Washington has acknowledged Islamabads cooperation in furthering the nascent dialogue process with the insurgents whose leaders are allegedly using Pakistani territory for planning attacks on the Afghan side of the border, charges Pakistani officials deny.
Foreign Secretary Janjua recounted her country's unprecedented human and economic losses while fighting the U.S.-led war on terror as a partner nation. She noted U.S. leaders repeatedly acknowledged Islamabads cooperation helped in decimating the al-Qaida network in the region.
Pakistans continued support to the efforts of international community in Afghanistan through Ground/Air and Sea lines of communication was unquestionably critical to the success of this Mission in Afghanistan, Janjua noted.
Pakistani military chief General Qamar Javed Bajwa also defended his countrys successes against terrorism, saying it has done much more for peace in Afghanistan than any other country.
We have paid the highest military, economic, political and social cost and the world should acknowledge that. We shall continue to contribute towards peace in Afghanistan but Pakistans honor and Pakistans security shall always stay premier, an army statement Monday quoted Bajwa as saying.
The United States and NATO continue to heavily rely on Pakistani land and air routes for sending supplies to their troops in landlocked Afghanistan.
In an interview with Fox News and subsequent tweets on Monday, Trump asserted that everybody in Pakistan knew bin Laden was hiding in the country, but they withheld the information from the United States, despite receiving $1.3 billion a year in aid.
Trumps tirade angered Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan who slammed the American leader for making false assertions.
Khan noted that Pakistan has suffered 75,000 casualties since joining the war on terror and incurred economic losses of more than $123 billion. He added that U.S. aid was what he called a minuscule $20 billion.
The traditionally uneasy relations between Pakistan and the U.S. have deteriorated particularly since August 2017, when President Trump announced his South Asia strategy to tackle the resurgent Afghan Taliban. He directly accused Pakistan at the time of sheltering Taliban and other militants involved in deadly cross-border attacks against U.S. troops. Islamabad swiftly rejected the accusations as politically motivated and stemming from Afghan battlefield setbacks. - VOA

According to him,a decision by the Executive could not be challenged by the legislature without consulting the Supreme Court.
He stated this in reference to the No-Confidence Motion moved by the Opposition against PM Rajapaksa saying that his appointment is illegal and inconsistent with the constitution.

Bringing relief to people, strengthening economy
PM TO INTRODUCE RELIEF PACKAGE
The government under the guidance of Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa will introduce a relief package today to help the people affected by the poor financial management and poor financial policies of the previous UNP government, Parliamentarian Dullas Alahapperuma said.
Alahappreruna added that Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Finance Minister will implement the package aiming to ease the peoples burden while strengthening the countrys economy.
MP Alahapperuma along with Minister Wimal Weerawansa and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa were addressing the media yesterday at the Prime Ministers Office in Colombo.
Accordingly, more attention will be drawn to strengthen the agriculture sector and export sector.
These sectors will receive tax concessions with a view to increase investments, he added.
Alahapperuma added that the countrys economy was badly affected due to the narrow sighted unsystematic monetary decisions made by the previous government. The production and export sectors were severely affected with various taxes heaped on them. The relief package will focus on increasing overall production, especially export oriented productions.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as Finance Minister has submitted a proposal to do away with the 14 per cent tax imposed on agricultural products, for a period of five years.
Accordingly, the Government will take immediate steps to remove the 14 per cent tax imposed on profit earned from selling agro products. This concession will be valid for five years, government sources said.
Explaining what the Government intends to do, the sources said, for example, a coconut seller who sells and earns Rs.100 as profit, has to pay Rs.14 to the government; if one earns Rs.100 as profit by selling paddy, he has to give Rs. 14 as tax to the government. The Government under the Premiership of Mahinda Rajapaksa has decided to exempt farmers from paying that 14 per cent tax for five years, sources added.
Immediately after assuming the post of Premiership, Mahinda Rajapaksa as Finance Minister took measures to reduce price of oil products twice, and bring concession to suffering masses due to escalating price of essential goods owing to high price of oil and oil products, the sources added.
While speaking on the Parliamentary Select Committee (PSC), Alahapperuma said the majority in the PSC should be allocated to the governing party. All the previous Speakers had given the majority of the PSC to the ruling party. Accordingly, the government has already nominated seven members to the PSC while the JVP has nominated 33 members so far.
He said that the PSC will consist of 12 members.
Speaking on the statement made by UNP Parliamentarian Ranjan Ramanayake on a recent TV programme, Alahapperuma condemned the comments made by Ramanayake, citing that he (Ramanayake) was trying to intervene in the affairs of the countrys judiciary. It is unethical to talk about the judiciary, he said.
He requested the UNP to wait until the court decision on December 7.
While condemning the behaviour of the Speaker, he added that the Speaker should have taken measures to appoint the PSC on November 14 itself on the day Parliament was reconvened.
As a result of the Speaker didnt take any measure to appoint the PSC,the Parliamentary system was affected, he said.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa said Temple Trees and its resources are being misused by various people including thugs and undesirables.
It has been reported that several valuable items including monuments, souvenirs received from various dignitaries and foreign countries are missing. It is also reported that a set of invaluable ancient paintings were missing during late President Premadasas period. Those paintings were later found on a pavement in the UK, he said.
He accused JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake is doing contracts of UNP. Therefore, Red elephant caves are standing for UNP.
This is an issue of Anuras job. Anura works for the gains he receives from Malik Samarawicrama, he Weerawansa said.
Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said the Cabinet has approved to present a vote on account in Parliament.
Then, the Finance Minister will present it in Parliament.
He also added that the countrys economy had suffered a setback during the last regime.
According to Central Bank statistics, the economy has been badly affected this year. That is the poor state of the economy that we this government has been saddled with. Besides, the previous government had entered into many agreements, which are unhealthy for the countrys economy, Minister Weerawansa added.

Considerable improvement in domestic financing conditions
Recent rating action by Moodys, unwarranted - CBSL
Domestic financing conditions have shown considerable improvement through spaces created and debt management strategies introduced recently.
Central Bank of Sri Lanka in a release said that this has reduced the roll-over requirement of Treasury bonds and SLDBs in 2019, 2020 and in the medium-term.
The Treasury bond maturities, which amounted to over Rs. 600 billion in 2018, are lower in 2019 and 2020, amounting to around Rs. 450 billion and Rs. 290 billion, respectively. Similarly, SLDB maturities, which amounted to around US dollars 2.3 billion in 2018, have also been reduced to around US dollars 0.62 billion and US dollars 0.82 billion in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Further, the new acquisition of government securities by the banking sector has increased by only 1.5 per cent in 2018 as against the trend increase of around 5% in recent years. These developments along with resource availability among institutional investors highlight the substantial space that exists to meet financing requirements from the domestic market.
Continued fiscal consolidation, particularly with the positive primary balance and the Active Liability Management initiatives, are expected to further strengthen the governments fiscal operations in 2019 and in the medium term.
CBSL is of the view that the decision by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) on 20 November 2018 to downgrade the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) does not properly reflect the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals, and therefore unwarranted.
Given these parameters, the CBSL is of the view that the recent rating action by Moodys is unwarranted. Such an action only on the premise of heightened political uncertainty, with no evidence of slippages in macroeconomic policies, cannot be justified.

Theyve been brilliant, very knowledgeable about the different grounds how they historically played, what theyve seen with their time here in Sri Lanka and obviously have an inside of a few of their players, said Root at the pre-match press conference held at the SSC yesterday.
Bayliss was Sri Lankas coach from August 2007 till the end of the 2011 World Cup where Sri Lanka were runner-up to India. Farbrace was coach of Sri Lanka from December 2013 till the end of the 2014 World T20 which Sri Lanka won.
Theyve been brilliant in games, well prepared for this tour and theyve been a big driving force in getting us to where we have got to. Been great to have their experience and know-how in these conditions, said Root.
Talking of a 3-0 whitewash Root said if his team can achieve that it would be massive.
Weve set out that we want to get to a certain destination and over the course of this winter weve so far played some good cricket. One area where weve not been as good as we can be in the past is winning back to back games and this would be a great opportunity for us to show were becoming more consistent, that were finding ways of winning and playing good cricket for longer periods of time, said Root.
There has been only two other sides who have won 3-0 out here in Test cricket so it would be a brilliant achievement which would fill us with a huge amount of confidence going into the rest of the winter.
Only Ricky Pontings Australians in 2004 and Virat Kohlis Indians in 2017 have won a Test series 3-0 in Sri Lanka before.
England for todays Test have rested one of their two main pacies James Anderson and included Stuart Broad for his first match of the series.
Its a great luxury to have isnt it For that amount of experience to be around the squad and offering so much to the group has been excellent. Weve played in conditions where weve not needed that much seam bowling in the middle but hes been raring to go and doing everything he can. Hes got the opportunity to play this week and Im sure hell be desperate to put in a really strong performance and show hes very skilful in these conditions, said Root of Broad.

Saudi warns Crown  Prince a red line  in Khashoggi probe
UK: Saudi Arabia has warned criticism of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is a red line, after Donald Trump heaped praise on the kingdom in defiance of warnings he was giving Riyadh a pass on a journalist's grisly murder.
Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir said on Wednesday that calls for thecrown prince to be held accountable for the grisly killing of Jamal Khashoggi would not be tolerated.
His comments came as the US president praised Saudi Arabia for keeping oil prices low -- one strand of his argument against punishing Riyadh even though the CIA reportedly found strong evidence that the crown prince, the de facto Saudi leader, was involved in the murder.
In Saudi Arabia our leadership is a red line. The custodian of the two holy mosques (King Salman) and the crown prince are a red line, Jubeir told the BBC.
They represent every Saudi citizen and every Saudi citizen represents them. And we will not tolerate any discussion of anything that is disparaging towards our monarch or our crown prince. Khashoggi, a US resident who wrote for The Washington Post and had been critical of Prince Mohammed, was lured to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2, killed and reportedly dismembered.
After lengthy denials, Saudi authorities admitted responsibility and said 21 people had been taken into custody. However, a CIA analysis leaked to the US media went further, reportedly pointing the finger at the crown prince.
But Trump, on holiday at his Florida Mar-a-Lago Club on Wednesday, doubled down on a statement from Tuesday that he was essentially ignoring the killing of Khashoggi because of what he said were more important US strategic and commercial interest Oil prices getting lower. Great! Like a big Tax Cut for America and the World. Enjoy! $54, was just $82, he tweeted. Thank you to Saudi Arabia, but let's go lower! Jubeir insisted that Prince Mohammed had not been involved in the killing.
We have made that very clear. We have investigations ongoing and we will punish the individuals who are responsible for this, he said.
He called on Turkey to come forward with all its evidence about the slaying and stop leaking out information.
The foreign minister said the murder was a rogue operation by intelligence officers.
Jubeir also said any possible US sanctions on Saudi Arabia would be short-sighted. - AFP

Stroll down memory lane
The Ladies College - Class of 72 reunion this year was a day away at Villa Minnehaha on the idyllic shores of Deduwa Lake in Bentota. The name Minnehaha or laughing water in Longfellows epic poem the Song of Hiawatha comes to mind as a fitting title to this magnificent property.
This years organisers of the batch reunion were Ruwani J, Shanthi D and Sharmini R, who put together a fun package for the day away with great panache!
We began our journey in Colombo and cruised along the Southern expressway to leave at some point to navigate skinny and winding roads passing swathes of paddy fields and serene countryside to reach our destination which abuts Bawas famous Country Estate Lunuganga. Finally, as we reached the end of the track with great anticipation voila there she was fair maiden Minnehaha or Laughing Waters beaming and beckoning us.
We scrambled eagerly out of the vehicles to walk down the well-appointed, open plan, magnificent Villa. Minnehaha stood majestically on beautifully landscaped gardens at the edge of an expanse of tranquil waters surrounded by dense thickets. The stillness and the silence engulfing theawe inspiring scenery was heavenly as we stood still in that soul touching moment to breathe-in deeply and savour the feel of our salubrious surroundings complete with the smells, the sounds, the sightsof natures wonderful gift to humanity.
The shrill cry of a kingfisher piercing the stillness brought us back to earth and we were warmly greeted by our lovely hostess Nelum with welcome drinks of fresh thambili with opaque tender kernel swirling like clouds in highball glasses and a ruby red melon juice with a hint of lime were delightfully refreshing.
The girls were on a natural high meeting and greeting one another like long lost friends with great enthusiasm whilst stretching their limbs after the journey and exploring the generous space of the Villa and its landscaped gardens. Having settled in comfortably, our school day cravings and a fix of a sort of spicy amba achcharu with a twist of sharp and sweet flavours, was passed around generously for those who still had the teeth for it, and the squeals of delight at the sight of now rarely seen, hard to buy and hard to bite Bulto - a deep brown sticky toffee that virtually delivered a locked jaw when chewed upon! Nevertheless these were relished with great fervor whilst walking down memory lane,avidly talking of tuck shop days.
Asmid-day approached and the adventurous having had a dip in the emerald waters of the pool to cool off, and a few lucky ones enjoying a boat ride in the lake, the irresistible aroma of food wafted through the air guaranteeing a delicious meal; we were hungry. Nelum had planned meticulously and prepared a delicious meal with Baby Nona her capable cook the daunting task of appeasing thirty five discerning palates! As expected the table was laden with a sumptuous array of local delicacies in every form; curried, tempered, fried, sambals, sauts, pickles, chutneys and the lot and to top it all off, as in fully rich dessert with plentiful second helpings with no thought to boot for the expanding waistlines; we were stuffed.
In between the events of the day we still had time for excited chatter and swap news of children, grandchildren, concerns for husbands who were ailing with uplifting stories of making sweet lemonade when life threw lemons! We remembered with great affection and empathyour colleagues who have gone before us, notwithstanding the joys, celebrations, heartaches and hardships of our alumnae.
The class of 72 though scattered far and wide, their unity and diversity were a celebration; mellowed like fine wines and gourmet cheese with the passage of time and the diverse paths that each one uniquely travelled in their journey of life, these were women firmly grounded, intrinsically housewives and mothers, who laboured not so long ago to nurture and raise their young families juggling challenging careers. Now at sixty something years, these glamourous wives, mothers, aunts and doting grandmothers were reaping their reward and enjoying their labour of love believing that the best is yet to come!

Tenant farmers in the Hambantota district staged a protest over the decision taken by the agrarian services department to give a share of 18 bushels of paddy per acre to paddy field owners, instead of 14 bushels that was given in the past.
The farmers said they are cultivating paddy fields under trying circumstances by obtaining loans.
A representative of the Ridiyagama integrated farmer association said that a tenant farmer has to spend Rs.70,000 to cultivate an acre of paddy and derives only an income of Rs. 21,000 per acre. The representative said this issue will be brought to the notice of the relevant authorities at the district agricultural committee meeting.

Thirty-eight ceremonies in North for Mahaviru Week
During the LTTE Mahaviru Week from November 21 to 27, there are 38 commemoration ceremonies that have been organised in the Northern and Eastern provinces. Accordingly, the Daily News learnt that 12 such ceremonies have been organised in Jaffna, six in Killinochchi, 12 in Mullaitivu, six in Vavuniya and two in Mannar.
Police had gathered intelligence information with regard to reports that a ceremony was scheduled to be held at 9.00 am on November 21 at a site on Rasa Road, Kopai, by former MP Selvarasa and that an LTTE flag was to be hoisted.
However, although the police had not interfered with commemoration ceremonies that were held throughout the Northern province, commemorating those killed during the war and raising LTTE flags has not been permitted as the LTTE is a banned organisation and it is thus, illegal.
The police had notified the Kopai court regarding the findings gathered through intelligence reports. The courts had given the police time until November 22 to report if such illegal acts had been committed.
However, when the Daily News contacted the Senior DIG of the Northern Province, Roshan Fernando, he said that the police was on alert for any illegal activity that may take place during this period. He added that the police would not hamper any commemoration ceremony to remember the dead of the Tamil families in the North. However, he said no illegal activities would be allowed to take place on the pretext of commemorating the dead.
Meanwhile, Jaffna university students too, had organised commemoration ceremonies to remember the dead at the Mahaviru monument at the Jaffna University. The area had been decorated with yellow and red flags.

Time for a Sane Constitution
For forms of government let fools contest; whatever is best administered is best - Alexander Pope
Among a people generally corrupt, liberty cannot long exist - Edmund Burke
This is quite a game, politics. There are no permanent enemies and no permanent friends. Only permanent inteests - William Clay
When late in the blustery evening of October 26 President Sirisena swore in Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister he set in motion a constitutional crisis of an unprecedented intensity. To say it was a surprise move is an understatement. There was a sitting Prime Minister; the President offered no public explanation, prior or even immediately after, for his drastic move. A few days later, the President went on air explaining the difficulties of working harmoniously with the incumbent Ranil Wickremesinghe, pointing to a series of alleged acts of commission and omission. He adverted to several instances of corruption, implying collusion/collaboration therein. The President highlighted an alleged assassination plot targeting him, towards which investigation the attitude of the Prime Minister and his administration was indifferent, in his assessment.
The incumbent did not throw in the towel, claiming the allegiance of a majority of members of Parliament, Ranil Wickremesinghe continues to occupy Temple Trees, the sprawling colonial era bungalow, the official residence of the Prime Minister, while Rajapaksa the newly sworn in Prime Minister took charge of the Prime Ministers office along Flower Road. Meanwhile the security detail (said to be more than one thousand), the staff and perhaps the vehicles allocated to Wickremesinghe have been reduced considerably.
European political models/practices
Temple Trees, like all institutions adopted from the European political models/practices; came with a new way of life and thought. We embraced end products (ideas and institutions) without the organic cultural development which engendered them. The White House or No 10 Downing Street may have a particular symbolic meaning in the creating culture, but here in the adopting culture, only a mimic; embarrassingly contrived, confounding a massive confusion.
Predictably, the actions of the President has given way to various views; supporters claiming that the process followed was a legitimate exercise of Presidential powers while his opponents damn it as unconstitutional and bad in spirit.
According to our constitution, interpreting constitutional issues is a responsibility of the Supreme Court. Neither party has referred the matter to the Courts, thus leaving it open for the humble citizen to give his own interpretation to the dramatic events happening at the centres of power.
The 1978 Constitution was a fundamental departure from the Westminster model we had followed from 1948. Prior to 1978 the President was only a constitutional head, acting on the advice of the Prime Minister, who was responsible to Parliament. With the 1978 Constitution we ventured in to uncharted territory, a hybrid presidential system (a hotchpotch, copying from both American and French models), embracing the concept of an elected President with executive powers, but with certain differences with the countries cited. We dont have a vice president like in the US, while our Cabinet is exclusively from the legislature, for example.
1978 Constitution
As the head of the Executive, the President appoints the Cabinet, Ministry Secretaries and presides at Cabinet meetings.
It is the President who appoints the Prime Minister; the member who in his opinion commands the confidence of the parliament. There is no requirement to take a poll in parliament to determine the numbers. In the reverse situation, if in the opinion of the President, the person so appointed has lost the confidence of the Parliament, can he remove him The legislative processes must continue, the executive must function. In the scheme of the 1978 Constitution (and the amendments), with a stalemate between the executive President and the Legislature as at present, it is near impossible for there to be any governance to speak of.
The ongoing crisis has also resurrected a common spectre of our politics, back-door dealings; fickle men, the faithlessness of our legislators when it comes to party allegiances and their clear lack of ideology. The very men who in 2010 subserviently endorsed the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, which sought to enhance the already formidable powers of the President, just five years later in 2015 self-righteously voting in the 19th Amendment purporting to curb the scope of presidential power.
There is provision in the 1978 Constitution to forfeit the membership of a parliamentarian failing to adhere to his party line. A person is elected on the basis of a party programme (manifesto). If he defies the party whip or crosses over to another party, he betrays his voter. In legislative processes there could be occasions when a member may feel obliged to go against party discipline on the basis of his conscience or in the national interest. The ideal remedy would have been to require him to face a by-election in the respective electorate to renew his mandate. But that is not possible under the District wise list system which came with the Constitution. In reality, nevertheless, even the requirement to remain faithful to his Party has no meaning, judicial interpretations have made the automatic forfeiture of membership upon breach of party line, a dead letter.
Unlike Moses commandments, our laws do not come down from heaven. Boosted by his unprecedented 1977 electoral triumph to a philosopher king status, JR Jayewardene pronounced that the country needed a Presidential system, which he opined would be less subject to legislative instability. In fact, the result was the reverse, Sri Lanka entered its most turbulent period since independence soon after. In terms of economic growth, the constitution does not seem to have mattered at all, countries that did not tinker with their constitutions have progressed at a much faster pace.
War against terrorism
At a recent seminar a participant argued that the war against terrorism was won only because of our Presidential system. On a global scale our so-called war, a conflict between two sets of people born in this country, was dragging on only because neither party was strong enough to deliver a decisive blow. Great Britain which has fought many wars all over the world, including two World Wars, did not think a presidential style of government was needed to fight wars. On the other hand, Hitler, who centralized power in his hands lost the war he started. Like Alexander Pope said, Whatever is best administered, is best
The unsuitability of the Presidential system is borne out by the introduction of the 19 Amendment, an effort primarily by a UNP led government to curb Presidential power; a concept which in the first place was their (JR Jayewardene) brainchild. It is amazing that while nearly all parties decry the constitution, and at various times have suffered at its hands, none have moved to jettison it altogether. As long as individual leaders could dream of exercising presidential powers someday, they were willing to let it run.
Proportional representation
Another controversial aspect of the 1978 Constitution is the idea of proportional representation. As a concept there is merit in a system which allows minority representation in proportion to their numbers. But in a horse trading political culture, small parties acquire a bargaining power far above their actual numbers. It cannot be said that proportional representation has alleviated the lot of the minority groups. Their leaders on the other hand, have been empowered totally out of proportion, opening up opportunities for personal enrichment in every way, including unbroken stays as ministers.
There are no permanent friends or enemies for them, only permanent interests. It is impossible to imagine that they have a mandate for the political gyrations they perform once elected. A plethora of small political parties have also led to the emphasizing of differences in the community rather than of fostering a long term national identity.
Concomitant with proportional representation, a District wise list system of voting was introduced. This method of voting, while advantageous to the big names, encourages patronage and corruption on a wide scale. The party leaders become all powerful, undermining democratic instincts in the particular party, an effect which finds expression in the wider society eventually. A major party can ensure the election of an undeserving person by merely placing him strategically on a list. The system also allows for list MPs who dont face any election. Sometimes these unelected MPs end up dominating the legislature as well as the financial management of the country, a fundamental violation of the principle of accountability to the voter.
If the 1978 Constitution has led to the abuse of power, social corruption and moral decay, amendments thereto have only worsened the situation by their piecemeal and incomplete nature. Before the whole country now stands the fragmentary nature of the 19th Amendment. In a potentially explosive situation such as today, an effective way of releasing the deadlock would be to let the people speak, by way of a General Election. The amendment appears to be standing in the way here.
Laws must be clear and functional. What applies to the primary law, the Constitution, is true many times over with other laws created by the selfsame legislators. A tax consultant told me that our Inland Revenue Act has had so many amendments, and amendments to those amendments, that it makes no sense to look at it for guidance. The only way to get results with the tax department is to negotiate with officers there, a path susceptible to abuse; favouring the powerful, leading to corruption.
Only the restoration of a parliamentary system, as we had before 1978, with requisite adjustments suggested by our constitutional experiences since, can bring stability and sanity to the muddled scheme prevailing. There is a fear that an unsuitable constitution has corrupted the nations overall moral fiber as well as democratic instincts to such an extent, that even a new constitution may not be able to restore confidence in the legal framework fully. It needs the support of other laws with similar direction. Among ideas suggested are the strengthening of the right to information, the expansion of Ombudsman functions and laws to effectively investigate unexplained asset betterment.
From our experiences in electoral politics it has become apparent that there cannot be a true democratic process until the political parties that come to power through that process are also democratic institutions in every sense. Most of our political parties function like semi-feudal societies with the leader being all powerful. There is a compelling case to insist on greater transparency, truly democratic constitutions as well as laws that open up and control political funding vis--vis our registered political parties.
Never has the warning - among a people generally corrupt, liberty cannot long exist rung as urgently as now.

Two Koreas connect  DMZ road across border
SOUTH KOREA: North and South Korea have connected a road across their shared border for the first time in 14 years, Seoul's defence ministry said Thursday in the latest reconciliation gesture between the neighbours.
The dirt road, which is wholly within the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, will be used for joint operations next year to recover remains from the 1950-53 Korean War.
The 12-metre-wide construction of the route in Cheorwon, near the mid-point of the DMZ, is one of several steps agreed at the Pyongyang summit between the South's President Moon Jae-in and the North's leader Kim Jong Un in September.
The neighbours also pledged to remove bunkers and weapons from the border truce village of Panmunjom.
But Seoul and Washington are pursuing increasingly different approaches to the nuclear-armed North. The dovish Moon has pursued a policy of engagement with his isolated neighbour, while the US insists pressure should be maintained on Pyongyang until it denuclearises.
Pictures handed out by Seoul's defence ministry Thursday showed a South Korean soldier and a North Korean counterpart taking part in the recent roadworks holding their hands out toward each other, with their colleagues watching.
It is historically significant for the North and the South to open a new passage and jointly engage in operations to recover remains of war dead at the place which saw the worst battles during the war, the ministry said.
Despite its name the area around the DMZ is one of the most fortified places on earth, replete with minefields and barbed-wire fences.
US Secretary of Mike Pompeo stressed this week that Washington wants to make sure that peace on the peninsula and the denuclearisation of North Korea aren't lagging behind the increase in the amount of inter-relationship between the two Koreas. - AFP

Uncapped Harris, Tremain make Australia squad for India Tests
SYDNEY: In-form opener Marcus Harris is set to make his debut after being picked Thursday in Australias squad for their first two Tests against India alongside fellow rookie Chris Tremain.
The 26-year-old, who smashed 250 not out against New South Wales last month and is the Sheffield Shields second-highest run-scorer, is expected to open the innings in Adelaide on December 6 alongside Aaron Finch.
Tremain, Harriss uncapped Victoria team-mate, was also included as part of the bowling line-up.
Aside from them, the squad is mostly unchanged from the one that drew one Test and lost the other against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates last month.
Steve Smith, David Warner, and Cameron Bancroft remain unavailable as they serve bans for ball-tampering.
Usman Khawaja, who opened the batting on the UAE tour, was included but is yet to prove his fitness after knee surgery. If ready, he is set to come in at number three.
Marnus Labuschagne, who played on the Pakistan tour, has been axed with middle-order batsman Peter Handscomb back in the frame after losing his place during last years Ashes series. He is up against Travis Head for the number six slot.
The top-class bowling attack is spearheaded by Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and Nathan Lyon with either Tremain or veteran Peter Siddle the fourth seamer.
National selector Trevor Hohns said the 14-man squad for the Adelaide and Perth Tests would be cut to 12 ahead of the games, with two players released to get match time in domestic Shield cricket.
We believe all players chosen deserve their selection in the squad, and were confident given the opportunity all will apply themselves well against India, he said.
Harris could not be ignored after putting together a string of strong scores, averaging 87.50 so far this season, with former coach Darren Lehmann among those backing him.
It was current coach Justin Langer who described Harris at the start of the 2016/17 season as being mediocre with flashes of brilliance when the batsmen left Western Australia for Victoria, where he has since flourished.
But Hohns said he deserved his place in the squad, after proving he could perform in high-pressure situations.
Not only has he made plenty of runs, hes displayed the mental application we believe is required to compete at Test cricket, he said.
Fellow opener Matt Renshaw was again overlooked. He was close to a Test recall for the tour of the UAE but suffered a concussion in a tour game and has since failed to impress in the Sheffield Shield.
Like Harris, Tremain earned a call-up after some stellar domestic performances, where he is the second highest wicket-taker this season.
He has also been a consistent wicket-taker over the past two seasons, and thoroughly deserves his place in the squad, said Hohns.
Australia play four Tests against India, starting in Adelaide, then Perth, Melbourne and Sydney. AFP

Proposal to cut financial allocation to PMs office
UNF MOTION HAS NO LEGAL BASIS
Former External Affairs Minister and Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna Chairman Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday stressed that the motion submitted by the United National Front (UNF) proposing to cut the financial allocation to the Prime Ministers office has no legal basis as the budget for 2018 has already been passed in Parliament.
He said there is no possibility for moving such a motion as the budget has already been passed and the allocation has already been made for the financial year ending December 31, 2018.
The Budget has already been passed up to December 31, 2018 and the allocation cannot be cut, he said.
Prof. Peiris also pointed out that the Opposition cannot move a Finance Bill in Parliament. A Finance Bill can only be moved by the government and thereby the opposition cannot move such a motion.
It has no legal basis whatsoever. There is no possibility for the cutting of funds when funds have already been allocated for the Ministries and so on. The budget up to the end of year has already been passed in Parliament, he said.
Professor G L Peiris added that there would have to be a budget for the next year or a Vote on Account beginning from January 01, 2018 to find the required resources.
There would have to be a budget or a Vote on Account next year beginning from January 1,2019 to find the required resources. Right now, there is no possibility of moving such a motion proposing to cut allocations for the office of the Prime Minister, he said.
Meanwhile, Finance and Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary S.R. Attygalle yesterday said that any motion proposing to cut financial allocation to the office of the Prime Minister will be futile as Parliament has already approved the allocation of funds for government institutions.
I dont know whether this proposal has any bearing as the budget for 2018 financial year has already been passed in Parliament, Attygalle added.
However, Attygalle added that there is a procedure, if a motion is moved aiming at pruning or suspending the Financial allocation of the Office of Prime Minister. He said that the Appropriation Bill for 2019 has already been submitted to Parliament and any motion seeking to suspend the allocation for the Prime Ministers office should be brought as an Amendment to this Bill.
There is no point in bringing a motion for cutting the financial allocation for the Office of the Prime Minister this year as Parliament has already given approval for the allocation of funds through Budget 2018.

UPFA should get majority allocation - Chandima
As the ruling party, the UPFA should get the majority of members in all Parliamentary Committees, said former Deputy Speaker and UPFA Chairman of Committees MP Chandima Weerakkody.
Speaking to the Daily News he said, Parliamentary practice has always been for the ruling party to have at least one member in every Parliamentary Committee. Even in 2004 the ruling party initially had only 104 which went down to 60 after the JVP left. Even in such instances, the government had the majority. Therefore, since the UPFA is the current ruling party, it is just for the UPFA to get the majority allocation of members to these committees. When contacted regarding the Parliamentary procedure and the appointing of members to the Parliamentary Select Committees, the Speakers office said that Parliamentary procedure for today would be decided after the Speaker met with the party leaders this morning.
Expressing his views in this regard JVP  MP Bimal Ratnayake said, Firstly as there is no government or opposition party in Parliament currently; we will have to first appoint the committee of selection. This is clearly stated in the Standing Orders. These Standing Orders do not specify any government or opposition side. This was passed in Parliament on the 19th and the members would be selected for these committees proportionate to the number of members represented in Parliament by each party. As the JVP, the Secretary General had notified us to nominate two members from our party and we have nominated Vijitha Herath and Nalinda Jayatissa.
He said that Parliament will meet today in accordance with Standing Order 22, after the prorogation of Parliament. After the Speakers announcements, the JVP Adjournment Motion regarding the socio-economic issues that have arisen due to the political coup which they say should be resolved would be taken up after the main Parliament business.

The Canadian High Commissioner has created a furore with his comments on the political situation in the country.
Commenting on a twitter message sent to MP Namal Rajapaksa by the Canadian High Commissioner in Sri Lanka David McKinnon, Sri Lankas Ambassador to Russia Dr. Dayan Jayathilleke in a Facebook message has stated: shameful and outrageously intrusive An unprovoked aggression on the part of a Diplomat Intervening in the domestic debate to rebuke and rebut Namal who was criticising the UNP-JVP-TNA.
It is interesting to see UNP, JVP and TNA politicians meeting with the international community. Perhaps if more effort was given towards meeting with the people and communities of Lanka and paying heed to their hope for elections, Sri Lanka finally can achieve its fullest potential, MP Namal Rajapaksas tweet said.
Canadian High Commissioner McKinnon in reply to MP Namal states: You might ask some of your Podu Jana Party colleagues who they are meeting with,. This has drawn the attention of Sri Lankas envoy to Russia, Dr. Dayan Jayathilleke and he throwing facts to the face the Canadian High Commmissioner has indicated that his reply shows intervening in the domestic debate, to rebuke and rebut Namal who was criticising the UNP, JVP and the TNA.
MP Namal Rajapaksa, while thanking the Canadian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka McKinnon said: Thank you for your engagement. Recalling that Sri Lanka remains a sovereign nation and home to a brilliant people, the leaders of Sri Lanka, whoever they may be, should focus on engaging with Sri Lankan people, and solving their concerns, including their call to elections.

Thus Spake the Speaker, Third Citizen
Who Disgraced the Mace
Speakers in the past and present have acted as Head of State; Unbiased; Jailed for cheating; Used Decisive Vote; Appointed from the Opposition for 33 days.
The Speaker, especially of a legislative body, is its chair or the presiding officer. The title was first used in England in 1377. The Speaker, fourth citizen, remains firmly non-partisan, and renounces all attachments with his former political party when taking office. The Speaker does not participate in a debate or vote (except to break ties) where the Speaker vote according to Denison's rule, a convention by John Denison, Speaker of the House of Commons (1857- 1872), on casting vote in the event of a tie always vote in favour of the status quo. For example, in a Motions of No Confidence, the Speaker will vote against it.
Denison's rule is now a guiding code in many other bodies where the Chair remains neutral. If a proper vote was taken on the NCM against PM on 15th and 16th that ended in deadlock, Karu, who amply exhibited his biased attitude, have violated the Denison's rule.
Traditionally political parties in the opposition refrain from contesting his seat at general elections that follows allowing the ex-Speaker to be elected unopposed to Parliament. In 1952 and 1956 elections all opposing parties refrained from contesting Speaker Sir Albert F Peiris who entered the fray as an independent for Nattandiya seat. Usually the Speaker continues in that office. Unfortunately this does not happen in modern Sri Lanka.
The Speaker is not a mere chairman, he is the repository of the powers, dignities, privileges and liberties of the MPs and through them the elector at large. This is in addition to the standing orders, convention and practice powers the Speakers authority. He will not allow a member to propose suspension of Standing Orders strictly except in an emergency situation. There had been four unsuccessful NCMs against Speakers in the past.
Sir Francis Molamure: Served a jail termcollapsed on the chair
Under Colebrook Constitution Sir Francis Molamure was elected to the Legislative Council in 1924 representing Kegalle District. Donoughmore Constitution brought him unopposed to the first State Council in 1931 representing the Dedigama seat.
Molamure set a world record by becoming its first Speaker, and under Soulbury Constitution he repeated it in 1947 in a contest as the first Speaker of the first House of Representatives. His opponent, Sir Stewart received 18 votes while Molamure secured 35. He absented himself for three months without leave and lost the Dedigama seat and the positions of Speaker on August 25, 1935. His resignation was accredited to undisclosed personal reasons Then he kept away from politics altogether for a few years (serving a jail term being convicted in private cheating case, thereby, the first to disgrace the Mace). He returned to the legislator in 1943 being elected to the State Council at Balangoda by-election.
With proceedings of the House on, Molamure collapsed on the Speakers chair and passed away a couple of days later on January 25, 1951. Lawyer, Alfred Francis married Adeline Meedeniya, the daughter of another senior legislator J. H. Meedeniya - Adigar, of Legislative Council: his widow later entered the State Council as countrys first elected female legislator.
Karu (Karunarathne) Jayasuriya, second to disgrace the Mace
A man with Corporate sector and Military background, Karu had experienced an eventful political life in the two decades with many negative occurrences. Karu won the CMC election in April 1997, and was chosen as the UNP chairman. A poster promoting him appeared throughout the walls of Clombo saying, Awoth Karu Payai Hiru (sun will shine if Karu comes) to which the opposition replied with an equally big poster (Awoth Karu  Penney Tharu) If Karu comes we will see stars!. Karu betrayed his boss RW when the party was out of power, by leading a 17 member UNP team to the government benches under the pretext of strengthening the hands of President MR. However, he did not last long as a minister in Rajapaksa Cabinet; but returned to the former boss and mentor, leaving the other 16 with the government to lead an anti-Ranil Conspiracy playing the role of Muusila to conquer the very man who brought him into politics.
The Speaker Karu Jayasuriya did not speak a word against an attempt to prorogate Parliament unscrupulously to avert it from being presented when COPE headed by DEW Gunasekara was about to present his report on the historys worst state robbery, the disgraceful Central Bank bond scam, by the former PMs friend Arjuna Mahendran.
The powers for proroguing, convening, and dissolving are a privilege and a right of the President under Constitution. American embassy tweeted Met Speaker of Parliament Hon. Karu Jayasuriya @KaruOnline to discuss the importance of Parliament reconvening to put an end to this political crisis. These democratic institutions should serve the people of #SriLanka; let the elected representatives have their say it read.
He was acting as if it was the Speaker who appoints PM; creating confusion among the people. Karu J allowed his party to suspend Standing Orders, conventions and practices of the House and bring in a NCM against the PM, and with no proper counting within minutes declared that the motion was passed with 122 votes. Didnt he disgrace the Mace
33-day Speaker, and the only one from Opposition
TB Subasinghe, the independent member from opposition was elected in 1960 March, as no party received sufficient numbers to form a lasting government, which was dissolved after five weeks.
Once Hugh Fernando from chair ruled in oppositions favour, that a Speakers decision in response to a point of order could not be questioned when the then Opposition Leader Dudley Senanayake raised a point of order in September 1964. Further, when JRJ conspired with two opposition members to co-sponsor a government bill to take over Lake House, Hugh Fernando ruled that the opposition member sponsorship was not procedurally wrong. The strategy of JRJ was to delay the passing of the Press take-over Bill.
Hugh Fernando, the Sirimavo governments Speaker, did worse damage to his party when used his decisive vote against government when the house was divided on Throne speech on December 3, 1964. The master strategist Esmond Wickremesinghe, father of Ranil Wickremesinghe along with JRJ engineered a mass crossover of a group of thirteen MPs led by CP de Silva, the Minister of Land, Irrigation and Power from the SLFP-LSSP Coalition to opposition. With both sides having 73 votes each, and Speakers decisive vote going in favour of the opposition, the government was defeated by one vote. Consequently Parliament was dissolved. Did Hugh disgraced the Mace, and violated the Denison's rule by voting against his party or was it an act by an unbiased Speaker
Stanley, the defiant
In 1973, during Sirimavos UF government Dr. Colvin R de Silva warned Speaker Stanley Tillekeratne that he could be sacked for some reason, any reason or no reason at all, when the impartial Speaker ruled in favour of opposition.
Speaker Bakeer Markar - acts as Head of State
Both the President and PM had to attend the Royal wedding of Prince Charles and Diana in 1981. The then third citizen was Speaker, Deshamanya Marhoom Al Haj Mohammed Abdul Bakeer Markar, who took oaths as acting Head of State for the first time in independent Sri Lanka. Honesty of purpose and sincerity won him admiration. As an unbiased and straight forward Speaker, during his career he performed with determination and always firmly committed to the accepted Parliamentary norms practices, and never allowed the ruling party to introduce a Motion to suspend Standing Order even in favour of his own Party, the UNP.

Parliament to appoint Select Committee today
Will Speaker be at sixes and sevens ...
Parliament meets today with raised concerns by political groups, analysts and intellectuals whether Speaker Karu Jayasuriya will drag it to a yet another showdown in the selection of members to its Committees so as to be applauded by those foreign ambassadors who have so far shown a high opinion of him.
The government group has already submitted seven names of its MPs to be appointed to the 13-member Selection Committee of Parliament in which the Speaker shall be Head.
Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Prof. G L Peiris and Minister Dinesh Gunawardena yesterday said they hope that the Speaker will give the government the majority of membership in the Committee of Selection respecting the longstanding tradition of Sri Lanka's Parliament that the majority of Select Committee members is given to the government group.
Asked about the possibility of Parliament erupting into chaos in today's sessions, Samarasinghe said, It is certain that we will not take any part in such eventuality."
Asked if it was a not a problem for them given the UNP's argument that they have the majority in the House, Samarasinghe said, "The UNP's argument is incorrect in this instance because Parliament has strong traditions that any Speaker is bound to preserve."
"Besides," he said,"we are the largest single political party in the country. The UNP's so called majority comes only when the JVP , the TNA , and other political parties put together in their purported line-up, which can change anytime with tensions rising within the United National Party about Wickremesinghe's leadership."
"A majority counted by heads and represented by the people at an election are two different things," he explained.
Meanwhile, political critics said it was apparent considering the behaviour of the UNP so far that they are hardly prepared to give any lee way to the government to quell the impasse they had created in Parliament.
"The UNP is currently trying to create an unrest in the country by fashioning fears in the people with various statements and resolutions, such as that the government cannot spend or borrow money to pay salaries of public servants, state debts and the like without the approval of Parliament," a political analyst said.
'With the recent steps taken by President Maithripala Sirisena having yielded results in terms of calming down the House of representative, The UNP, the TNA and the JVP have taken an intensified course of creating a bleak hostile rhetoric towards the executive branch of Sri Lankan government," he said.
"They do this to cover up unparliamentary behaviour of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya who is currently under heavy flak by former Speakers, deputy Speakers, intellectuals and senior legislators of Parliament for creating chaos in Parliament as with his actions inconsistence with the Constitution overreaching and defying the powers of the executive to appoint the Prime Minister and the Cabinet.
President Maithripala Sirisena has said that Speaker Jayasuriya will soon have to face the music of his unconstitutional behavior.
Jayasuriya presumably angry after his political party's leader Ranil Wickremesinghe being sacked by the President and the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the President, has made statements against the gazettes he has lawfully received from the President.
He had made Mahinda Rajapaksa sit on the Prime Minister's chair in Parliament and addressed him as an MP. After creating this impasse in Parliament the Speaker passed a no-confidence motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament at breakneck speed by taking a voice vote amidst shouting and yelling of the members creating an artificial vacuum of a prime minister.
The Speaker has acted against the President's interest, the privileges and the prerogatives of the executive to move forward the country.
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa during his adress at the opening of the House said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is intentionally violating the Constitution and carrying out his political party's agenda in Parliament mobilised by UNP headquarters at Sirikotha.

Youth protests over land dispute
A person in the Mahaweli C Zone staged a protest on the roof of the Dehiattakandiya Mahaweli Project Management Office on Wednesday, as authorities had failed to resolve a land issue after 12 years.
The protester, 26-year-old Sujith Niroshan of Ulpathawewa, Veheragala, climbed on the roof in the morning with his documents, saying that the land granted to his father had been given to another person, although he he had demanded right to ownership of it.
The youth said that his grandfather was granted several lands in 1990, including paddy fields, and that they were used by his father after his demise. He added that that his father had been imprisoned later and since then, for 12 years, he was demanding the land to be given to him. Niroshan added that instead of giving them to him, the lands had been given to someone else.
However, Niroshan ended the protest when Dehiattakandiya Mahaweli Project Management Office Manager K.A.C. Vimal Kumara had promised to grant him other lands to continue his cultivation.
