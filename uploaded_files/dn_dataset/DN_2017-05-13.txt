Govt. gives priority to national reconciliation
All issues need to be solved within a framework of social justice and the government has made national reconciliation a priority, said President Maithripala Sirisena as he addressed the Plantation community hopeful for a better life under his leadership yesterday.
As the President addressed a public rally at the Norwood Sports Complex in Dickoya on the occasion of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis visit to the hill country for the opening of Dickoya Base Hospital, he remarked that the Tamils of Indian Origin community had faced many challenges over the years, the main being that of citizenship.
I am happy to say that you are all Sri Lankan citizens today, the President said and explained that the issues of citizenship which was made political was never resolved completely, Though former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike tried to find a long term solution through the Sirima-Shasthri agreement, it was not resolved. Governments thereafter also worked on it,the President said.
Those who live on the plantation do not have a right to own land and are provided with line-houses, rent-free as long as a member of their family works in the plantation.
Many live under poor living conditions and facilities, President Sirisena said.
When you are citizens, you need villages to live in. The people for a long time did not own land, the government thus plans to give plantation families with seven perches of land each and help them build houses, promised Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while also referring to the Indian Housing Scheme project which is working on providing housing to the Plantation Sector.
The government, he said was working on a program to improve science education, vocational training and to provide assistance to students from the plantation sector to enter university. He added that this would be in addition to the national programme of 13 years of compulsory schooling.
Referring to the grand gesture made by the Indian Government with the refurbishment of the Dickoya Base Hospital with 150 beds, a new maternity ward, operation theaters, an Intensive Care Unit (ICU) and surgical wards, the Prime Minister stressed that,
We have to reciprocate the warm relationship Prime Minister Modi shares with Sri Lanka.
I know the people here are very happy that Prime Minister Modi paid a visit to their area and opened a hospital which was a very generous gift,reiterated the President and observed that the refurbishment he started in 2011 as the Minister of Health had come a long way.
Never did I think that I would be President when this Hospital would be re-opened and neither did I think that the Indian Prime Minister himself would come for its opening, said the President.

Ali century anchors cautious Pakistan to 376
Dominica: Azhar Ali's 14th Test century anchored Pakistan to a first innings total of 376 as the tourists batted with exaggerated care on the second day of the third and final Test against the West Indies on Thursday.
Left to negotiate 11 overs to the close of play at Windsor Park in Dominica, the West Indies reached 14 without loss in reply.
Pakistan's innings occupied all of 146.3 overs at a scoring rate of just over two-and-a-half runs per over, a puzzlingly pedestrian rate of progress on a benign pitch, especially as victory would give Pakistan their first-ever Test series win in the Caribbean in eight attempts.
After crawling along in the morning session, when only 58 runs came off 28 overs in two-and-a-half hours of play for the loss of Younis Khan's wicket, the tourists attempted to accelerate with captain Misbah-ul-Haq releasing the shackles of virtual strokelessness in getting to 59.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Sarfraz Ahmed was by far the most enterprising of all in the Pakistan batting line-up though, being ninth out for 51 off 73 balls.
"We wanted to get over 400 but losing wickets in the afternoon caused us to lose a bit of momentum," Ahmed explained after the day's play. "I just went out there with a positive intent, looking to put the bowlers off and keep the score moving along."
Off-spinner Roston Chase was the prime beneficiary of the visitors' belated attempt at acceleration, finishing with four for 103 while captain Jason Holder claimed three for 71, including two wickets off consecutive deliveries after tea that ended any reasonable prospect for Pakistan getting to a total in excess of 400.

Another 10,000 houses for plantation sector
Indian PM Modi promises:
Extension of 1990 Indian Ambulance Service to rest of the country :
Air India starts Colombo to Varanasi flight for Hindu devotees :
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday assured 10,000 more houses to the Plantation sector and the extension of the 1990 Indian Ambulance Service to the rest of the country as he promised the Tamils of Indian Origin community that India, would continue to be a part of the onward journey of Tamils of Indian Origin and work tirelessly along with the Sri Lankan Government towards their social upliftment in all possible ways.
Air India has also started a direct flight from Colombo to Varanasi in India, to make it easier for Hindu devotees seeking pilgrimage there, the Indian Prime Minister said.
The Indian Prime Minister also hoped that Sri Lanka would be an active participant in celebrating International Day of Yoga next month.
Addressing a large gathering of around 35,000 people who had trekked 5 km up a hill to the Norwood Sports Complex in Dickoya, Modi observed that he was the first Indian Prime Minister to have visited the plantation community.
The highlight of his visit to the Estates was to open the refurbished 150 year Dickoya Base Hospital. At a generous grant of Rs.1,200 million from the Government of India, the hospital is expected to cater to around 300,000 people in the area; of whom 80 percent work in the plantation sector. The hospital, which would be the second largest in the Nuwara Eliya District was welcomed with great appreciation among the audience who make up one of the poorest communities in the country. Only 8 percent in the community, according to the Department of Census and Statistics own a house and the Indian Housing Scheme has built 4,000 houses thus far.
To the community of Tamils of Indian Origin, Modi acknowledged their labour and contributions made to the country, Ceylon Tea is famous the world over but what is not known is that it is your sweat and toil that makes it the brew of choice for many in the world,he said.
Sri Lanka is the third largest exporter of tea, because of your hard work.It is your labour of love that makes Sri Lanka able to meet 17 percent of the world demand of tea and bring in USD 1.5 billion in foreign exchange into the country,the Prime Minister continued.
As the community nears 200 years since its first arrival in the country, Modi remembered their forefathers; those men and women of strong will and courage, who undertook the journey from Indian to Ceylon. Their journey may have been uphill and the struggle hard but they never gave up. Today,we remember and salute that spirit,he said, while he added that the community had also to fight hard to win their rights and uplift their welfare thereafter but they did it in peacefully.
We will never forget, Savumiamoorthy Thondaman, who fought for your rights and upliftment, he added to great cheer and applause and observed that the Indian Tamil community had adapted well to Ceylon, You are a children of the Tamil mother but Matter of pride that many of you also speak Sinhala, Prime Minister Modi added.
There is no better sign that a multilingual society living in peace and harmony and that calls for celebration and not confrontation, Premier Modi said.
We take much joy in the success of the Indian origin diaspora across the world, said the Indian Prime Minister and he hoped that the relationship across the Palk Strait could be further nurtured to ultimately contribute to the uplift of all Indians and Sri Lankans.

Batistuta offered Adelaide coaching job
ADELAIDE Argentine goalscoring great Gabriel Batistuta has been offered the chance to coach Australian A-League club Adelaide United, a report said Friday.
The 48-year-old, his nation's all-time leading goalscorer before Lionel Messi overtook him last year, is wanted as a replacement for departing Spaniard Guillermo Amor.
Adelaide chief executive Grant Mayer said capturing Batistuta was a priority given former Barcelona star Amor had decided to leave.
We're chasing a suitable replacement after Guillermo Amor has all the respect and goes out on his own terms, Mayer told the Adelaide Advertiser newspaper.
With Batistuta an offer has been made, but there is also a Plan A, B and C. The report said Batistuta was intent on bringing a team of two Argentine assistant coaches with him and the club was finalising the intricacies of the package deal.
Batistuta, regarded as one of the best strikers of his generation, scored 56 goals in 78 games for Argentina, and netted more than 200 for Fiorentina in Italy's Serie A.
The flamboyant Argentine, who lived in Australia from 2007-11, has no top-level coaching experience. AFP

Blitzbokke aim to break Fiji hold in Paris
PARIS: South Africa take to the Stade Jean-Bouin pitch in Paris this weekend in the knowledge that they could break Olympic champions Fijis hold on the World Rugby Sevens Series title.
Fiji have been crowned champions over the last two seasons, but go into the ninth and penultimate round of the series 25 points behind the Blitzbokke.
With 22 points on offer for tournament winners, the scenario realistically means Fiji have to target wins in Paris and series-ender London, on May 20-21, and South Africa fail to make the knockout rounds.
Added spice comes from the fact that the two sides could meet in the quarter-finals in the French capital, where Samoa were winners last season.
The anticipation of the Olympics was something different to the situation that we find ourselves in now, acknowledged Blitbokke forward Tim Agaba.
We are very mindful of our own processes and systems and what the job at hand is. There is no sense in getting ahead of ourselves.
We will be focusing on what we need to do, game for game and tournament after tournament. We are treating all tournaments the same, getting back to the basics every time and start from there. The results then tend to look after themselves. Blitzboks will face Scotland, Japan and Canada in pool A, while Fiji were drawn with Australia, Samoa and Russia in pool D.
New Zealand will face the United States, Wales and Argentina in pool B, while host nation France are aligned with England, Kenya and Spain in pool C.
French hopes will lie solidly at the dancing feet of their electric Fiji-born winger Virimi Vakatawa.
Vakatawa makes his welcome return to the shortened game after appearing in the Six Nations for the nations 15-a-side team before injury ruled him out of the Hong Kong sevens tournament.
France, however, will be without talisman Terry Bouhraoua and Pierre Gilles Lakafia, while featuring full international Julien Candelon in his swansong before retirement.
New Zealand touch down in Paris in the unusual position of having no tournament wins to their name this season.
A raft of injuries has seen All Black hopes repeatedly hit in the high-octane abbreviated game of rugby, but coach Scott Waldrom welcomes back experienced heads Joe Webber, Lewis Ormond and Sam Dickson for Paris.
The All Blacks Sevens are currently fourth in the standings.
We are looking forward to upping our performance in the last two tournaments of the series, said Waldrom.
While we are placed fourth overall, our aim is to improve that ranking, and as always, win the next two tournaments.
Paris is an opportunity for the team to play with the determination and consistency we know were capable of. When we are on our game we have beaten the teams ahead of us in the series standings.
This tournament is about putting together six consistent performances and playing at our peak every game as were in a very tough pool again. Turning to injuries, Waldrom was first to admit that it was something that affected not just his team.
At this stage in the season a lot of teams are getting hit with injuries so its something we have to accept and deal with, he said.
The new players have brought some great enthusiasm to training this week and it has lifted everyones performance so far. Pools Pool A: Canada, South Africa, Scotland, Japan Pool B: United States, New Zealand, Wales, Argentina Pool C: England, Kenya, France, Spain Pool D: Australia, Fiji, Samoa, Russia Standings 1. South Africa 157 points, 2. Fiji 132, 3. England 130, 4. New Zealand 110, 5. USA 101, 6. Australia 94, 7. Canada 76, 8. Argentina 72, 9. Scotland 68, 10.

Buddhas teaching: best path towards sustainable peace: Indian Premier
The Buddha's teaching is the best solution for the biggest challenge to sustainable world peace today, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said yesterday.
He was addressing the gathering at the commemoration of the 14th United Nation's Vesak Day Celebration at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
"The biggest challenge to sustainable world peace today is not necessarily from conflict between the nation states," Indian Prime Minister said.
"It is from the mindsets, thought streams, entities and instruments rooted in the idea of hate and violence. The Menace of terrorism in our region is a clear manifestation of this destructive emotion," he said.
The Indian Prime Minister said it was a matter to be sad that those ideologies of hate and their proponents in the region were not open to dialogue and open only to causing death and destruction.
"I believe that Buddhism's message of peace is the answer to the growing arc of violence all over the world," Indian Premier said. "The Lord Buddha preached two and half millennium ago that 'No higher Bliss than Peace'," he said.
He said Buddha's teaching was relevant even for today and Buddha preached about tanha or greed. He said the same greed had driven the mankind to dominate and degrade their habitats. He said the universality of the Buddha's teaching; the middle path, is striking.
"The world also owes a debt of gratitude to Sri Lanka for preserving some of the most important elements of the Buddhist heritage," Indian Prime Minister said. "Vesak is an occasion for us to celebrate the unbroken shared heritage of Buddhism. A heritage that connects our societies across generations and through centuries," he said.
Prime Minister Modi said Sri Lanka takes pride in being among the most important nerve centres of Buddhist teachings and learning.
He said Buddhism and its various strands are deep seated in our governance, culture and philosophy. "Our region is blessed to have given to the world the invaluable gift of Buddha and his teachings, Modi said.
He said India and Sri Lankas friendship is etched in time by the great masters and same is spread across many layers. He added that the friendship of two countries lies in the hearts of people and the fabric of society.
"Most grateful to President Sirisena, PM Wickremesinghe and to the people of Sri Lanka for extending to me the honour of being the Chief Guest at the function," he said.
He also suggested that on the blessed day of Vesak, "let us light the lamps of knowledge to move out of darkness; let us look more within; and let us uphold nothing else but the truth.
And, dedicate our efforts to follow the path of Buddha whose light shines all over the world".
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressed the gathering.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Buddha Sasana and Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, former Presidents Chandrika Kumaratunga and Mahinda Rajapaksa participated.

Buddhas teachings are revolutionary: PM
The Buddha who preached the dhamma thus ending the sufferings, some 26 centuries ago set the foundation for social justice by introducing equality among his order, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Many teachings of Gautama Buddha were revolutionary, Premier Wickremesinghe said. For Instance take the concept of equality at a time when the social, political and economic order were based on inequality. Buddhism gave everyone the right to seek the truth. Consequantly, all the people were treated equally,the Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister was speaking at the inauguration of the 14th United Nations International Day of Vesak at the Bandaranaike Memorial International Conference Hall (BMICH) yesterday.
The Premier also said that Vesak Poya Day, 26 centuries ago ushered the greatest revolution to the world by the Enlightment of Gautama Buddha. Gautama Buddha preached the way to ending the craving in the human mind, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister also said that the Sangha consisted of the poorest of the poor and the richest of the rich. Those considered outcast then social order all got together within the Sangha. It built the foundation for social justice. Lord Buddha said that the one who conquers his own mind gains the greatest victory, Premier Wickremesinghe said. A well guarded mind brings peace within the man.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the Buddhas teachings is relevant to the people even today because Buddhism choose the moderate path and espoused the need to strengthen social justice.
During the Buddhas time, there was no state or person who could destroy the world, Premier said. But today, it is not so as there are situations that could result in mass destruction around the world. It would affect sustainable peace, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister added that Buddhism could bring about sustainable peace by way of social justice.

CA order on Geetha has no effect on UPFA list: SP Chief Minister
Even if former Galle District Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was disqualified to be a Member of Parliament owing to her dual citizenship in both Sri Lanka and Switzerland as per the Court of Appeal order of May 3, the same disqualification could not be applied to determine the legal validity of the entire list of candidates who contested the 2015 Parliamentary Election under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva asserted.
The Chief Minister was addressing a press conference held at Dhakshina Paya, the Southern Province Ministry complex , Labuduwa, Galle, yesterday.
There are some basic qualifications in respect of candidates that are considered at the time of receiving nominations stipulated under the Election Law. Among such basic qualifications there are no issues such as dual citizenship and related concerns as basic qualifications. Any matter other than basic qualifications regarding the legal validity of a candidate should be challenged at the judiciary according to the Election Law. On the other hand, the Court Of Appeal has given a ruling concerning the legality of Geetha Kumarasinghes election as a Parliament member. Hence, due to the Court order given in respect of an individual candidate in a list, the respective entire list of candidates would not be null and void, he further asserted.
In response to a question by the media about rumours of a change in the ministerial portfolios of the Councils Board of Ministers, the Chief Minister said that similar gossip were spread on several occasions, while there was no truth in such stories.
However, change of ministerial portfolios, expulsions and resignations are not a new experience to Provincial Councils. Earlier too, there had been many such incidents. Article 154-E-4 of the Constitution distinctively prescribes the constitutional provisions with regard to the appointment of Chief Minister and the Board of Ministers, he said.The Chief Minister further said that according to his knowledge, there would be no change in ministerial posts in the Southern Provincial Council, adding that he too did not wish such adjustments in the Board of Ministers of the Council.

He also said that not only the Buddhist brothers but the Tamil brothers too can visit the land of Kasi in Varanasi using the same flight.
The strong ties between Sri Lanka and India are not confined to Buddhism, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said.
We too are committed to the economic prosperity of our Sri Lankan brotherns. We will continue with our investments in Sri Lanka making positive changes and economic growth to deepen our development cooperation, Prime Minister Modi said.
Premier said that the India Development Corporation with Sri Lanka amounts to USD 2.6 billion in Sri Lanka. It only aims to support Sri Lanka in realising economic development because the economic and social wellbeing of the people of Sri
Lanka is linked with that of 1.25 billion Indians, the Indian Prime Minister said.
He added that the Indias strength lies in sharing its knowledge, capacity and prosperity with Sri Lanka.
India and Sri Lankan are already significant partners in trade, investment and free flow of trade, investment and technology, the Indian Prime Minister said. This would mutually benefit the two countries. India is rapidly developing and these divedends could be enjoyed by other countries in the region,specially Sri Lanka. You will find in India a friend and partner that will support you in your endeavours of nation-building,Prime Minister Modi added.

End the narcotics scourge
We have witnessed an alarming increase in the number of narcotics related offences in recent times and yesterdays newspapers alone reported several incidents. In one of the most high-profile cases this year, around 200 kilogrammes of heroin worth Rs.2 billion was seized at the Anawilundawa Bird Sanctuary in the Chilaw coastal area on Thursday morning. A suspect and a Land Rover Defender were also taken into Police custody.
Police say this is the largest haul of heroin detected in Sri Lanka in the recent past. Police believe that the mastermind behind this heroin smuggling racket is the same individual behind the recent Piliyandala incident where officers of the Police Narcotics Bureau came under attack, killing one policeman. In another incident, Police found heroin with a street value of Rs.35 million in a garbage dump at Maradana, one of the busiest areas in Colombo.
These incidents expose two trends in drug smuggling. Sri Lanka is being used by smugglers as a hub  sometimes Sri Lanka is the final destination but sometimes the narcotics are bound to another destination via Sri Lanka. Preliminary investigations reveal that the 200 Kg of heroin was brought by ship from Pakistan into Sri Lankan waters, where it had been loaded to a multi-day vessel. The multi-day vessel had then transferred the haul of heroin to a day-fishing vessel which carried it to the Muthupanthiya beach to be handed over to the suspect.
The other trend is the brazenly visible nexus between the underworld and the narcotics trade. The Piliyandala shooting is a prime example for the involvement of various gangs in the illegal drugs business. Drug running is a lucrative business for organised crime gangs and also terrorist groups. A US$ 75 million shipload of tramadol, a synthetic opioid-like drug used as a painkiller to be sold to ISIS terrorists in Libya to give them greater strength, was recently seized by the Italian police. The smuggling route involved South Asia.
There is only none answer to both these trends: better intelligence, vigilance and policing. During the recent past, drug smugglers enjoyed political patronage at the highest level. That link has now been firmly severed, but it is not easy to entirely cut off the flow of narcotics given our porous maritime borders. The Sri Lanka Coastguard and the Navy cannot be everywhere as they have limited resources and even for the Indian Coastguard and the Navy which have far more resources, it is not easy to maintain 24-hour vigilance in a vast stretch of the sea. Besides, both sides also have to ensure that fishermen from both countries do not cross the International Maritime Boundary Line, which is a full-time task. However, they often manage to catch culprits despite the constraints  last month, the Sri Lanka Navy nabbed six drug smugglers.
Narcotics smugglers make use of these factors to sneak their way in. They smuggle not only drugs, but also other valuable contraband such as gold and cigarettes, but nothing beats narcotics in terms of money. South Asia has become a sort of an alternative golden triangle for drug smugglers. This calls for enhanced cooperation among all SAARC countries to curb the smuggling of narcotics. Sharing intelligence on narcotics smugglers is thus essential.
Border security and vigilance must be tightened. Our international airports have a good success rate in nabbing drug smugglers, but the same cannot be said about maritime entry points and borders. Any loopholes that exist in this regard must be closed by providing additional resources where possible. Most countries now depend on manned and unmanned air surveillance to gather intelligence on smugglers movements. Since we do not possess any specialized manned surveillance aircraft, the next best alternative is using military-grade Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs) to patrol our territorial waters. From procurement to deployment, this costs much less than operating manned aircraft. The UAVs can track any suspicious vessels in real time and ground-based controllers can alert the Navy/Coastguard to board or apprehend such vessels.
There is also a notion in society that only the small fry involved in the drugs trade such as street level peddlers ever get caught, while the kingpins get away scot free. It is indeed vital to net the big fish. Again, this is a matter of collecting intelligence and acting upon them. Taking action against the underworld is also vital because the drugs trade cannot thrive without their support and involvement. Any corrupt elements on the law enforcement side must also be identified.
Illicit drugs are one of the biggest problems faced by modern society. Addicts in Sri Lanka consume Rs.450 million worth of narcotics every day according to ADIC (Alcohol and Drug Information Centre). One can imagine the adverse effects of narcotics addiction on individuals, families, the wider society and the economy. After all, it is the youth in the prime of their lives who get addicted to drugs. The rehabilitation of drug addicts and the elimination of drug supplies must thus be parallel efforts. We should make every effort to save the future generations from this scourge.

Fonseka to rule the unruly
In this country medical profession is highly respected. Within that western Medics come first. Dr Senaka Bibile as an international figure is still respected in all four corners of the country. He was the founder of Sri Lanka's drug policy, which was used as a model for development of policies based on rational pharmaceutical use in other countries as well, by the WHO, UNCTAD and the Non Aligned Movement. He has been called the greatest medical benefactor of humanity that Lanka has hitherto produced'.
Today the co-founder of rationalist movement Carlo Fonseka dominates the profession as the head of medical council. GMOA was a respected trade union in the past; under the leadership of Sunil Rathnapriya, helped by Rajitha GMOA led the united front of trade unions in the health service. In turn it had a great influence within all unions in the country. Medical profession and other professions got their independence in the bourgeois democratic revolution. Cromwell, Washington, Napoleon and others paved the way for independence of professions under official charters, preventing hindrance to creativity and experiment from religious, political and judicial powers.
Some try to define that under professional freedom the SAITM has the power to be the tuition master, himself conducts an exam and produces doctors according to private degrees of the private medical college. This is absolute rubbish. Each profession is governed by a council of masters of the said profession. Only the masters of the profession can say what is good and bad in a particular profession.
Democratic revolution
This is a great victory of the democratic revolution which led to experiment and creation that produced the modern world. Hence no one can get a degree from SAITM if the quality controller, the Sri Lanka Medical Council, says poor quality.
No law can force such recognition. Whether state, private or semi government created, no medical degree will be valid unless it is accepted and register in the Medical Council. SAITM cannot disempower people, because only medical council empower that institute. The issue is most certainly that there is assessment, there are ratings, and there are minimum standards that have to be met for purposes of accreditation. The SAITM issue is about accreditation. Its about quality control.
One can vilify the SLMC and argue about the quality of doctors produced by state universities, but one cannot shove under the carpet the issue of coherent and comprehensive assessment. There has to be a single authority in the business of regulation or else a coherent and comprehensive process of evaluation. Someone can claim that the SLMC is not perfect. Thats fine. The solution would be to improve the institution and the processes therein; it is the duty of the elders of the profession to do it. The Government or the judiciary has no business to interfere.
Helpless patients
GMOA cannot call a general strike because it is not a federation of all or substantial sections of the trade unions spread across the various professions and trades. Such a federation or united front of trade unions should cover all sectors, government, corporations, and private sector. The alliance made by the GMOA consisted of small unions in government education, railways and postal department. So called One day strike call was not answered by workers in other sectors except one or two, here and there.
The important outcome of this partial strike is the attention made by the public to the role of the GMOA. The medical officers union claims that with about fifteen thousand members it is one of the most powerful trade unions in Asia.
Lanka is one of the rare countries where free medical service is available. People are making use of this facility with great respect to the doctors. They expect it to be there for them at any moment of misery and sickness. Hence any action of doctors could bring a calamity perhaps unheard of any other country. This mass veneration of poor people has become a ruthless weapon for the medical officers. When doctors are absent, masses become helpless. Strike is like doctors aiming guns at helpless patients.
In Parliament, ministers exposed that the GMOA president and members, while pushing thousands of patients to helpless misery in public hospitals, were engaged in channeled practice at private hospitals in the evenings; some of them are known to be earning tens of thousands of rupees a day. It is mainly the rich bourgeoisie who can afford this and the poor are left to suffer in silence or to die. That means thousands of medical officers were involved in some sort of double standards -- no work for the poor people in public hospitals and more work for the well-to-do in private hospitals. The GMOA appears to have become dictatorial and behaving like an underworld organisation. Inevitably the suffering victims are poor patients.
For the past few months, the GMOA leadership has been indulging in regular strikes demanding that the Government should take over the medical faculty of South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). If they are against private university education then they should mobilize masses to oppose private university education. Though it is a slogan for a socialist society it has a consistency. Masses may believe the campaign is for a socialist society. However there is no such socialist campaign by the reckless inteligencia of the GMOA. They want to nationalize the medical faculty at SAITM but they are silent about the students already there.
SAITM issue
President Maithripala Sirisena, speaking on this matter recently said he had a dialogue with all stakeholders on the SAITM issue and reassured the Government would find a solution which will be fair to all within the frame work of social capitalism. The President expressed regret that the GMOA was disregarding this move for a compromise within the accepted framework and demanding that SAITM be taken over; if that was done, investors whether they be foreign or Lankan would have major questions about investing here.
The GMOA strikes and the regular demonstrations held by some other groups backed by Mahinda Chinthanaya have prompted the Government to consider a suggestion for a crackdown on sabotage actions launched under the pretext of strikes and demonstrations. Left oriented trade unions have suggested anti sabotage mass actions.
One suggestion is that Sarath Fonseka, now a minister, could play a coordinating role as Peoples Martial in this move to ensure that essential services are not disrupted and tough action is taken in emergency situations. For this progressive trade unions and radical peoples organisations could work with the Martial Sarath Fonseka.
If the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is to launch an indefinite strike in all hospitals islandwide beginning from May 15 demanding the nationalization of SAITM the political struggle might come to the surface.

GMOA Secretary accuses Health Minister of protecting SAITM
The Health Minister is more interested in protecting SAITM than controlling the countrys dengue problem. The Health Ministry should declare the total number of dengue deaths, Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA HeadQuarters in Colombo yesterday, he accused the Health Minister of showing a keener interest in protecting SAITM by placing advertisements and allocating state hospitals for the use of SAITM.But, now dengue has become a major threat to Sri Lanka more than ever.
According to Dr. Zoysa, a total of 43,915 dengue patients had been reported throughout Sri Lanka during the past four months with around 35 dengue deaths reported from the Western Province alone.A total of 41.4 percent of dengue patients have been reported from the Western Province. Dengue cases have also been reported from previously unaffected areas such as Trincomalee, Baticaloa, Jaffna, Kalmunai and Hambantota.
The GMOA has already informed the Acting Director General of Health Services about the need for a immediate assessment of the dengue situation in the country and hope that it will stop SAITM Protecting Project and pay attention towards controlling dengue, Dr. Zoysa added.

India can be the next China for NBA, says top official
NEW DELHI - While China is the National Basketball Associations biggest market outside the United States, NBA Deputy Commissioner Mark Tatum said that India is ripe to grow the game as its changing sporting culture begins to offer its 1.3 billion people alternatives to cricket.
Speaking in an interview after the launch of the NBAs first academy in India on the outskirts of Delhi, Tatum pointed to the growing popularity of kabaddi, football and basketball as examples of the changing landscape.
Certainly cricket is by far the number one sport in India but we are seeing some rapidly growing sports now, he said on Tuesday.
With the availability of these games and these competitions from around the world, I think more and more the sporting culture is starting to change.
Now is the time for a sport like the NBA, a league like the NBA to continue to grow our business here.
Basketball goes back 100 years in China and the emergence of Yao Ming in 2002 saw the NBAs popularity soar in the worlds most populous nation.
India has yet to unearth a player who could galvanise such a fan base.
There were big hopes for farmers son Satnam Singh Bhamara after he became the first Indian drafted in the NBA in 2015 but his career failed to fire and he has since moved down to the D-League where he now represents Texas Legends.
There is a strong culture and history of playing the game of basketball in China. What we are doing now is were establishing that here in India. We really do believe that India will be the next China for the NBA, Tatum said.
(Its because of) Indias 1.3 billion people, a huge middle class population and a very young demographic, which is starting to think about other sports, like basketball.
FACEBOOK FANS
The NBAs popularity in India is driven by digital and social media, he said, pointing to the leagues seven million Facebook fans in the country.
We have partnership with Sony Six, airing 350 live games on their platform.
We have an India website now with localised content and we have extensive grassroot development programmes which has reached six million kids and trained 5,000 coaches.
All India needs now is its own Yao Ming, he said.
It will happen. I remember Satnam Singh. I had the opportunity to call his name at the draft in 2015. That was a historic moment.
Its only a matter of time before we get the Yao Ming of India and its possible that Yao Ming of India is right here at our academy today, he said.
The NBA has launched three academies in China and one in Senegal.
Asked why they picked the Asian neighbours, also the worlds two most populous nations, Tatum said: We have 113 players from 41 different countries and territories and not one from China, not one from India.
Its not that passion for the game is not there. In China 300 million play basketball.
We thought there was an opportunity to bring NBA-style culture ... to these particular markets to make sure we could maximise the potential of the kids.
Again, no inherent reason why there shouldnt be any NBA player from India or from China, none.
Its just how you give them the right training, culture, development and competition.

Kerry Packers World Series Cricket 40 years on
The first time Kerry Packer died was on Sunday 7 October, 1990. He had a heart attack during a polo match. Three minutes into the first chukka he slumped down, arms around the neck of his horse. He was clinically dead and stayed that way until he was brought back to life with a defibrillator.
When Packer was asked about the experience he replied: Ive been to the other side, and let me tell you son, theres fucking nothing there. When he died for the second, and final, time in 2005, they played a clip of a TV interview at his memorial service. The good news is that theres no devil, the bad news is that theres no heaven, he said. Theres nothing. The moral, Packer suggested, was that you should do what you want.
World Series Cricket reeled in some big names in the game.
And for much of his life, he did. Packer collected tall stories like a general does his ribbons. Wisden once listed five favourite tales that, it clarified, were believed to have a basis in truth. Even the punctilious staff of the Almanack were happy to relax their strict adherence to the facts for the sake of a good Packer yarn. They included the time he shut up a loudmouth American who kept bragging he was worth $200m by offering to toss him for it, double or nothing. And another when, turned away from one pub, he ate somewhere else, settled the 100 bill by writing a cheque for 100,000 and told the publican: Before you bank it, take it to the other pub and show it to the bloke who wouldnt give us any food.
There was plenty more of them on BBC Radio 5 Live last Wednesday when it aired a programme about the tallest Packer tale of them all, World Series Cricket. Ian Chappell tells one about the TV director Peter Faiman, who used to do the live shows for Packers Channel 9. When Faiman tried to quit his job, Packer offered him more money to stay on. Faiman turned him down. So Packer offered him a new job title too. When Faiman explained his decision wasnt anything to do with influence or affluence but just because he was feeling so bad now I could kill myself Packer pulled a gun out of his desk and said: I can fix that too.
The World Series Cricket story first broke 40 years ago this week, in early May 1977, after it was leaked to Ian Wooldridge and the Daily Mail. Cricket Circus Threat to Test Matches ran the Guardians front page headline. Those first reports suggested Packer was planning a series between Australia and the Rest of the World, that Tony Greig, Derek Underwood, Alan Knott and John Snow had signed up, and so had Clive Lloyd, Viv Richards, Gordon Greenidge, Andy Roberts, Imran Khan, Barry Richards and Mike Procter. In the end WSC was much grander than that. Packer eventually hired 70 players for 16 Supertests and 38 one-day games over two seasons.
Christopher Martin-Jenkins wrote with the possible exception of WG Grace  astonishing that he thought he had to add the caveat  there has been no more influential figure in the history of cricket. It was Packer who brought in coloured kit, floodlit day/night matches, white balls, and drop-in pitches grown in greenhouses. It was Packer who insisted players start wearing helmets, because, as he told Chappell: Im not paying you to lie around in hospital for six months. It was Packer who overhauled the way the game was televised and marketed. And it was Packer who forced the boards to start paying the players more. Before WSC, Englands players were earning 210 per Test. Soon after it, they were on over 1,000.
Packer was always honest about why he did all this. It wasnt for the love of the game. Is it right that you went into the Supertest business to make money he was once asked under cross-examination in the high court. Of course, he replied, I have never said anything else. All he wanted from it were the exclusive broadcasting rights to Australias matches. It took him three years to win them, and in that time he changed the game forever.
On the BBC, Chappell argues the IPL is a descendant of the WSC. And there is truth in that, in the way the IPL is packaged and sold to a mainstream audience, the pressure it puts on players to choose between representing their country and playing in a lucrative league. Like WSC, the IPL has forced the sport into accelerated evolution.
There are broader trends, too. Now, as then, Cricket Australia finds itself in the thick of a dispute with its own players over how much it is paying them. The players today may not be on fish and chip money, as Chappell used to call it, but the Australian Cricketers Association have just knocked back CAs proposal to pay them AU$419m over five years, an offer the ACA say will short change female players. Now, as then, the question of TV rights is up in the air, in Australia and elsewhere.
So many of the currents that swirled around Packer and the WSC are eddying again today and the game once again seems to be entering stormy waters.
The difference is that WSC was only ever a means to an end. Packer wanted the TV rights and when he had them WSC was shut down. But who knows where the IPL and Twenty20 cricket goes from here

Massive cyber-attack across the world

A massive cyber-attack using tools believed to have been developed by the US National Security Agency has struck organisations around the world.
Computers in thousands of locations have been locked by a programme that demands $300 (230) in Bitcoin.
In April hackers known as The Shadow Brokers claimed to have stolen the tools and released them online.
Microsoft released a patch for the vulnerability in March, but many systems may not have been updated.
How big is the attack
There have been reports of infections in 99 countries, including the UK, US, China, Russia, Spain, Italy and Taiwan.
Cyber-security firm Avast said it had seen 75,000 cases of the ransomware - known as WannaCry and variants of that name - around the world.
"This is huge," said Jakub Kroustek at Avast.
Many researchers say the incidents appear to be linked, but say it may not be a coordinated attack on specific targets.
Meanwhile wallets for the digital cryptocurrency Bitcoin that were seemingly associated with the ransomware were reported to have started filling up with cash.
Who has been affected
The UK's National Health Service (NHS) has been hitand screenshots of the WannaCry program were shared by NHS staff.
Hospitals and doctors' surgeries were forced to turn away patients and cancel appointments. One NHS worker told the BBC that patients would "almost certainly suffer" as a result.
Some reports said Russia had seen more infections than any other single country. Russia's interior ministry said it had "localised the virus" following an "attack on personal computers using Windows operating system".
People tweeted photos of affected computers including alocal railway ticket machinein Germany and auniversity computer labin Italy.
A number of Spanish firms - including telecoms giant Telefonica, power firm Iberdrola and utility provider Gas Natural - suffered from the outbreak. There were reports that staff at the firms were told to turn off their computers.
Portugal Telecom, delivery company FedEx, a Swedish local authority and Megafon, the second largest mobile phone network in Russia, also said they had been affected.
Who is behind the attack
Some experts say the attack may be have been built to exploit a weakness in Microsoft systems that was identified by the NSA and given the name EternalBlue.
The NSA tools were then stolen by a group of hackers known as The Shadow Brokers, who then attempted to sell the encrypted cache in an online auction.
However they subsequentlymade the tools freely available, releasing a password for the encryption on 8 April.
The hackers said they had published the password as a "protest" about US President Donald Trump.
At the time, some cyber-security experts said some of the malware was real, but old.
A patch for the vulnerability was released by Microsoft in March, but many systems may not have had the update installed.
Microsoft said on Friday its engineers had added detection and protection against WannaCrypt. The company was providing assistance to customers, it added.
How does the malware work
Some security researchers have pointed out that the infections seem to be deployed via a worm - a program that spreads by itself between computers.
Unlike many other malicious programs, this one has the ability to move around a network by itself. Most others rely on humans to spread by tricking them into clicking on an attachment harbouring the attack code.
By contrast, once WannaCry is inside an organisation it will hunt down vulnerable machines and infect them too. This perhaps explains why its impact is so public - because large numbers of machines at each victim organisation are being compromised.

McGirt, Hughes tied for lead at Players Championship
PONTE BEACH: Canadas Mackenzie Hughes and William McGirt fired identical five-under par 67s to take the co-lead following the first round of The Players Championship on Thursday.
Alex Noren, of Sweden, Spains Jon Rahm, J.B. Holmes and Chez Reavie shot 68s and are one stroke back at the TPC Sawgrass Stadium Course in Ponte Vedra Beach, Florida.
Very pleased. One of those days where I kept out of trouble, said Hughes, of Hamilton, Ontario. When I missed the greens I did it in the right spots and when I needed a par I was able to do it. South Africas Louis Oosthuizen and Francesco Molinari of Italy head a list of 11 players who shot 69 and are two strokes off the lead.
American Phil Mickelson, defending champion Jason Day of Australia, Rickie Fowler and Adam Scott of Australia are among those who shot 70 and are three strokes behind. Day, however, made three bogeys over his last four holes and had to settle for a two-under score.
World number one Dustin Johnson tops a large group at 71 that also includes German Bernhard Langer, who at 59 is the oldest player in the tournament.
Jordan Spieth, Rory McIlroy, Justin Thomas, and this years Masters champion Sergio Garcia all shot 73.
Garcias round was highlighted by a hole in one on the island hole No. 17. Garcia is the second to achieve the feat in as many years following Willy Wilcoxs previous ace on the par-three.
Garcia said it was nice to post an ace after getting off to a rocky beginning.
The feeling was great, Garcia said. I think I wasnt quite in the tournament because of everything thats been going on after the Masters win and media and people congratulating you left, right and centre. I felt like I was a little bit up in the clouds, and when I woke up, I was 4 over after six.

Mike Tyson says sky is limit for Anthony Joshua
He was boxings youngest world heavyweight champion, but Mike Tyson believes the sky is the limit for British fighter Anthony Joshua.
Former Olympic champion Joshua beat Wladimir Klitschko in the 11th round of a brutal bout in London on April 29, and the 50-year-old Tyson was deeply impressed.
Joshua, 27, put the 41-year-old Ukrainian on the canvas in round five but was floored himself in the following round before digging deep and stopping Klitschko with a technical knockout.
The test that he overcame in his last fight with Klitschko, the sky is the limit for him, Tyson told CNN Sport.
When you have a great heavyweight fighter ...you got to punch like that and make people happy and hurt people. [For] all those other little guys its over, especially for a heavyweight he appears to be, hes going to suck all the air out of the room.
Composure
Tyson was particularly impressed by the way Joshua recovered after Klitschko had put him down.
He could have stayed down from that punch. Most new guys that get hit with a punch like that they normally stay down, also they lose their confidence once they get up.
He stayed composed -- he was a little dizzy at first -- but for a young fighter with 18, 19 fights he did awesome.
Joshua, who won Olympic heavyweight gold at London 2012, took his unbeaten professional record to 19 wins with 19 knockouts.
Tyson, nicknamed Iron Mike, won his first world title at the age of 20 in 1986 and went on to dominate the division in a savage and often controversial career until his 1996 defeat by Evander Holyfield signaled the end of the New Yorkers boxing domination. - CNN

## Title: Moon rises in South Korea

Moon rises in South Korea
Moon Jae-in of the Democratic Party won the Presidential election in South Korea Tuesday May 9th. He obtained 41.1 percent of the votes cast as against 24 for Hon Joon - Pyo of former impeached President Park Geun  Hyes Liberty Korea Party and 21.4 for Centrist Ann Cheol Soo.
President Moon is expected to effect changes in many areas of domestic and foreign policy as he campaigned for a change in key policies hitherto followed by the conservatives for a decade. The election coincided with the highest tension in the Korean peninsula in recent times with North Korea testing new missiles and the United States and South Korea holding joint military exercises. Victory of Moon who campaigned for dialogue with North Korea instead of confrontation and a review of the installed THAAD (Terminal High Altitude Area Defense) anti-missile system indicates that South Koreans have voted for peace and national reconciliation between the two Koreas.
Moon is likely to pursue a conciliatory approach to relations with the North. He has already expresses his desire to re-open the Kaesong industrial complex in North Korea that is a joint venture between the two countries.
Installation of the THAAD system had antagonized China who legitimately considers it a national security threat and an unwarranted intrusion of the United States in its neighbourhood. Relations with China would improve under President Moon. At present the relations between the two countries are estranged. Korea is also economically affected by the limits China has placed on its citizens touring South Korea in retaliation to the installation of the THAAD system.
South Korea is also expected to distance itself somewhat from the United States since Moon and his party has been consistently opposed to the presence of US forces in South Korea. Perhaps it could follow Philippines in this regard.
In general the new President is likely to pursue a dynamic foreign policy which would focus on good relations with all its neighbours while maintaining the special relation with the United States at a low level. Despite the election campaign rhetoric it would not be pragmatic to expect South Korea to break off radically with Washington.
President Moon gave an indication of his foreign policy in his inauguration address in the following words: If I need I will fly to Washington immediately.I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang.
On the domestic front he will have to find a solution to soaring unemployment, especially of youth. He has also pledged to control the huge family businesses called chaebols that dominate the economy  a task many earlier Presidents either failed to undertake or did not wish to undertake.
Change of guard in Paris
As expected Emmanuel Macron won comfortably in the Second round of the Presidential election, winning 66.1 percent of the vote. At 39, he is the youngest President to assume office in France. His rival Marie Le Pen could only poll 33.9 percent of the vote.
Geographically Macron won in all electoral departments except two in the periphery. In general, voters with low education and less economic activity have voted for Le Pen. For example, in Paris where voters are more educated and economically more active Macron received 90 percent of the votes.
Abstention at the polls was highest this time compared to the previous Presidential elections. It amounted to 25 percent of the voters. It is assumed that supporters of the far-left and far-right did not go to the polls.
His victory is a consolation for those who stand for European unity. Following the Brexit vote in Britain there were predictions of conservatives gaining power in France. President Macrons victory has halted the forward march of nationalists in France and its impact is felt across the borders of most European countries.
However, he has an unenviable task of reconciling diverse viewpoints of different member states of the EU. The influx of refugees from West Asia, Africa and elsewhere as well as the attitude towards Russia are issues that divide these states. A thorny issue concerns French relations with Russia which are at a low key. The situation is further complicated by the pro-Russian attitude of German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who supports Macron. Similarly Britain and France have warmer relations despite their views of the EU being diametrically opposed. Macrons victory, however, has strengthened the EU vis--vis the United States, which under President Trump will be more inward-looking.
A much more challenging task awaits Macron at home. He has to face a General election in June, the First round of which is fixed for June 11th. There is hardly any time left for him to prepare. At present his party Forward March Party- has no representation in the 577 National Assembly. The established parties  Republicans and Socialists control it. In an effort to gather a formidable group to contest the parliamentary poll he is expecting dissidents from established parties as well as civil society leaders including local government luminaries to join him. Socialist candidate at the Presidential poll has already resigned from that party and has proclaimed his intention to contest the General election from a new party under his leadership. The far-Left candidate has openly broken away from the Communists who supported him at the Presidential poll. Opinion polls also favour Macron over established parties. Hence, there is a possibility of Macron getting a workable majority at the parliamentary poll. However, it is too early to forecast the possible alignment of forces still.
Incidentally Macron has promised a clean and efficient Government under a dynamic Cabinet of Ministers combining experience with expertise and skill. It would also be interesting to the Sri Lankan readers to know that he wants to prune the size of the French Cabinet from 18 to 15 i.e. by One-Sixth!

Nishikori injury sends Djokovic through
MADRID, Friday  Novak Djokovic moved into the semi-finals of the Madrid Masters on Friday without hitting a ball as Kei Nishikori withdrew citing the recurrence of a wrist injury, tournament organisers said.
The world number eight missed the Barcelona Open late last month due to the injury.
Nishikori is now also a major doubt for the Rome Masters next week with 10 days to go until the start of the French Open.
I will plan to play Rome, but we'll see. said the Japanese.
I cannot promise to play or pull out right now.
(The) French is more important.
Djokovic will either renew his rivalry with Rafael Nadal or face Belgium's David Goffin in the last four on Saturday.
In the Women's Madrid Open defending champion Simona Halep cruised back into the final for the third time in four years with a 6-2, 6-3 over Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova.
Halep also thrashed the world number 22 two weeks ago in Stuttgart and there was never any danger of an upset as the Romanian reeled off five straight games to close out the opening set.
Sevastova hinted at a fightback early in the second as she got out to a 3-0 lead.
But Halep, who is also into the semi-finals of the women's doubles with compatriot Irina-Camelia Begu, showed no signs of lacking in energy as she bounced back in emphatic fashion to win the last six games for the loss of just 14 points.

The numbers that define a Champions League legend
He made sure to praise the efforts of the team but once again Cristiano Ronaldo fully warranted an admiring glance in the mirror.
Some people were writing him off -- talking of his star being on the wane -- but on Tuesday night he was proving them wrong on the biggest stage of all. Again.
Ronaldos match-winning display in a 3-0 win against Atltico Madrid saw the Portuguese become the first player in history to score back-to-back hat-tricks in the Champions League knockout stages.
Under the backdrop of a blood red Bernabeu skyline, the 32-year-old put Los Blancos local rival to the sword in the semifinal first leg, taking more shots (five) than the entire Atltico team (four), finishing the night with more Champions League goals to his name than Los Colchoneros have scored in the entire 114-year history of the club.
An 86th minute sucker punch sealed his 42nd Real Madrid hat-trick, took him to 52 knockout goals, and all but booked Real Madrids passage to a third Champions League final in four years.
Ronaldo now has 103 goals in 138 Champions League appearances -- a record made all the more remarkable by the fact the four-time Ballon dOr winner didnt score until his 30th game in the competition, against Debrecen in the 2005-06 season.
Some call him selfish, but the Portugal talisman has more assists (31) than any player in Champions League history.
Some say he fails to perform when it counts, but he has more goals in the latter stages of Europes elite club competition than the group stages.
The truth is Ronaldo has refined his game with time, forsaking chalk on his boots and a role in the buildup for a greater goalscoring threat.
The former winger only had 50 touches of the ball on Tuesday night -- less than half of midfield maestros Luka Modric and Toni Kroos.
Ronaldo could conceivably go on playing for many more years, but he already leaves legendary Real Madrid goalscorers Ral (323), Alfredo Di Stfano (308) and Ferenc Pusks (242) in his wake.
As 80,000 fans returned home happy, Real manager Zinedine Zidane and captain Sergio Ramos both branded him unique.
This rugged, tough Atltico team had kept clean sheets in 59% of Champions League matches since Diego Simeone took charge, but now must hope for a miracle at the Vicente Caldern next Wednesday.

Post-Vesak politics: Dual Citizens and Cabinet shake up
The rivalry of politics is pushed to the rear to some extent as the country celebrates the Vesak festival with the added importance, as the host country for the 14th United Nations International Vesak Festival. The presence of the Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and the President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bandari at the events of the UN Vesak Festival, along with nearly 70 other foreign representatives, indicate the significance of this special Vesak event, in a country so closely associated with Buddhism and its spread in the world for more than 2300 years.
The presence of these two national leaders of neighbouring countries are of special significance as they are the leaders of the land where Siddhartha Gautama, who became the Buddha after Enlightenment, preached the message of the Dhamma; the Buddhist teaching, about which there is growing interest among peoples and societies, concerned by the increasing divisions caused by globalization and the political and economic, as well as racial and religious differences that prevail in the world.
As the country celebrates Vesak with its international recognition through the UN, it is necessary to remember that the UNs recognition of Vesak as an international day of religion was due to the efforts of Sri Lankas former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar who carried on a strong and determined campaign to have the UN recognize the special religious holiday, which has thus been celebrated since 1999.
The theme of the International Vesak Festival - Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable Peace  has much importance today in the context o the differences that prevail in the world, that affect both internal relations among societies within countries and international relations, too. It also has special relevance for Sri Lanka, with its long history of Buddhism, its significant position on the spread of Theravada Buddhism, and the impact of Buddhism on current aspects of social development.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his message on this Vesak said: The key condition for social justice is equality. The Buddhist teachings also give prominence to the universal concept of equality. The equality which is demanded by the contemporary world, had been taken into discussion during the period of the Buddha 2561 years ago. The Buddha said peace, which is the key factor of the existence of human beings can only be built in a healthy society where equality has been established.
This underscores the importance of Buddhism, and its core values, for the progress of Sri Lankan society, especially in the context of a nation resurgent after a prolonged war with terror, and the necessity to build a lasting peace through reconciliation among peoples and communities. The discussions on the theme of the UN Vesak Festival that will take place in Sri Lanka, and the rituals, cultural and other activities related this event, should hopefully help Sri Lankan society move forward in keeping with the true teachings of the Buddha; and avoid the distortions of these valuable teachings that are noticeable today, and at times pose dangers to the proper progress of this society.
Beyond the Geetha duality
The decision of the Court of Appeal that Geetha Kumarasinghe, who was elected as a UPFA member of parliament from the Galle District in the August 2015 General Election, is disqualified from being an MP, as a dual citizen, and the consequential action by the Parliamentary Secretariat to inform the Elections Commission of this, has led to new frothing of politics. The Joint Opposition was quick to accuse Parliament of acting at the behest of the Sirisena-Wickremesinghe administration. The JO position is that Parliaments rush to act on Geetha Kumarasinghes ouster by the Court of Appeal judgement, was due to her being a loyal supporter of the JO leader Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Not surprisingly, the charge against Parliament was made by the JO spokesman, and leader of the SLPP, Prof. GL Peiris, who never hesitates to rush to various politically sensitive or incorrect statements. No doubt Parliament will give its own answer to the professor. It is now reported that Geetha K has since appealed to the Supreme Court against the Court of Appeal order of her status as an elected member of parliament, while being a dual citizen. It is now to be seen what the Supreme Court decides with that petition for a revision of the Court of Appeal order. Geetha Ks action does question the JO position, as stated by Prof Peiris, that she has been denied the constitutional right to move Sri Lankas highest court against a lower court.
The JO, with all its buoyancy after the Galle Face May Day crowd, is certainly angry at the loss of one member of its political pack through the dual citizen issue. The analyses of the dual citizen issue by many commentators must certainly give cause for worry to the JO, because it is now found that the 19th Amendment has prevented those holding dual citizenship from contesting any election held for State office in the country. This holds a danger to other key personalities, backed by the JO and the SLPP, who have been identified and promoted by JO-bound academics as possible future national leaders, even holding the office of Executive President. This brings in a whole new area of political developments that had been hardly thought of in the political debates about the future leadership of the country.
In another twist to the Geetha duality issue, there is that other frequent joker of the JO, Bandula Gunawardena, who is calling for the demonetizing of the Rs. 5,000 and other currencies signed by the former Governor of the Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran, on the ground that he is a dual citizen. It will be interesting how this matter is handled, if and who it is raised in Parliament, as Bandula says he would, giving an indication of post-Vesak politics in the country. Present CB Governor, Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy, has told the media that as he understands there is no reason why a foreign citizen cannot become the Governor of the CBSL in this country, that it was the President who made the related appointment, and there were no plans to cancel the currency notes that Mahendran had signed.
Another matter of interest will be the response that JOs other loud and often hollow voice, Udaya Gammanpila, receives from the Controller of Immigration and Emigration on the names of any other MPs who hold dual citizenship. With JOs Gammanpila raising the question, it is likely the hopes are that the list would involve MPs in the government. Whoever it is, with the initial story break involving Geetha K, the public would no doubt be interested in knowing how many other dual citizens MPs there are today, and look forward to the constitutional process being properly applied to deal with them, if the need arises.
The Cabinet shake up
Vesak is over and the time has come for the much promised Cabinet reshuffle. After all the delay involved in what is considered a necessary move in government, the indications are that when it does take place, definitely at the correct astrological hour, it will not be the major event it was once expected to be. The current reports are that here will be no change of the parties  UNP and SLFP - in this shake up. Heads on the same side would move here and there, with the Greens and Blues keeping their own sides intact, but with a few changes of faces in ministerial positions. One will have to see how effective these changes will be for the better functioning of government, and also in meeting the increased public criticism of the slow pace of government, as well as the failure to address key issues such as corruption in the current administration, and the increasing issues of favouritism in key areas of governance.
In this context, the Cabinet shake up when completed will not help very much to reduce the differences between the UNP and SLFP within government. The divisions within the SLFP, as best seen on May Day, could well lead to a more increased rivalry between the parties of the ruling coalition; thrusting bigger loads on the President and Prime Minster to keep the coalition unity intact.
In an important post-May Day scenario is the Cabinet decision to expedite and better pursue the probes on allegations of corruption on the members of the Rajapaksa Regime, particularly, those in the Rajapaksa family itself. If carried out as the Cabinet has decided earlier this week, it could well help in changing the increasing public frustration at the failure of government to carry on its pledge to fight corruption that was a key item in the January 8 agenda. This will certainly need a new and higher level of unity with the coalition of national unity.
Such unity will certainly have to overcome the new issue of having three Cabinet Spokespersons  one from the UNP, one from the Ministry of Information, and the next from the SLFP. A post-Cabinet Media Briefing will be certainly more interesting, but how informative

President opens model Shakya Janapada first phase
President Maithripala Sirisena declared open the first phase of model Shakya Janapada, built in Kahapola, Piliyandala on Thursday
The model Shakya Janapada includes sacred places in India related to Buddhas life.
The President opened the first phase in line with the United Nations International Day of Vesak in Sri Lanka.
This model Janapada has been built on a 78-acre land at a cost of Rs. 500 million.
The models of King Shuddodhana's palace; Prince Siddhartha's three palaces; birth place; Buddhagaya, his enlightenment place, Kusinara, place of parinibbana, Isipathanaramaya where Buddha delivered his first sermon and other places related to Buddhas life can be worshipped at the site.
A fully-equipped Buddhist centre, Buddhist library, e-libraries, meditation centre, vegetarian restaurants, leisure halls and car parks will be arranged in the premises.

Royal go out favourites against Wesley
Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby :
Royal College will go out favourites against Wesley College in their Singer A Division inter- schools league rugby game at Royal Sports Complex at Reid Avenue today commencing 4.15pm.
The forte of the Royal side has been their power-packed forwards and they should come up with another blockbuster display through their now famous rolling maul. The Reid Avenue boys played a superb game against Zahira in their last game at Maradana, where they simply demolished their opponents winning 65-14.
Royal will have to come up with a similar performance if they hope to overcome the double blues with a bonus point victory for them to get a step closer to clinching this years Singer inter-schools league rugby title.
Meanwhile the unpredictable Wesley lads who turned tables on St. Peters last week at Longden Place and beat the defending league runners-up S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia in the first round game, will try their level best to create a shock victory against the formidable Royalists at their own den at Reid Avenue.
St.Josephs v S. Thomas
The eagerly awaited second round confrontation between defending league runners-up S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia and formidable St. Joseph's College Maradana for the Lady Jayathilake Shield should turn out to be a thriller.
A mammoth crowd is expected at Mount Lavinia today at 4:15 pm to witness this grand game between these two schools in their inter-schools league rugby tournament.
Today's match should turn out to be a battle between speedy three quarters of both schools. Meanwhile St. Josephs has given a terrific display throughout the season in the loose and probably should maintain their supremacy in todays game as well to pull a surprise victory.
St. Peters v Zahira
St.Peters College Bambalapitiya who scored a remarkable 15-13 win against Trinity College at Bambalapitiya will go all out to overcome unpredictable Zahira College Maradana in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby match at Zahira grounds. Maradana today. Kick-off is at 4.15pm.
Going by the performance of both schools another terrific tussle for supremacy can be expected. Zahira will be a dejected lot as their play maker cum fly half Zaid Sinhawansa who missed the last game against Royal will once again miss his services as he is recovering from dengue.
The Peterites who lost a hard fought game 14-26 against Wesley in their last match will strive hard to turn things around and it won't be a surprise if they emerge victorious.

Rubs shoulders with the biggest names in sport and showbiz : Roger Federer at the Met Gala 2017
The Met Gala is renowned for its unique themes and outlandish outfits.
For this year's edition of the fundraising event, the biggest names in sport and showbiz gathered in New York over the weekend to honour Commes de Garcons designer Rei Kawakubo.
And 18-time Grand Slam champion Roger Federer bought into the occasion, rubbing shoulders with Hollywood A-listers while wearing a Gucci tuxedo that featured an embroidered crystal king cobra emblazoned across his back.
Federer attended the Met Gala with his wife, Mirka, and admitted he had never worn anything close to the Alessandro Michele-designed tuxedo.
(It's) business in the front, party in the back, he told GQ.
Federer is widely considered the greatest tennis player of all time. And while in New York he bumped into another sporting icon - five-time Super Bowl-winning quarterback, Tom Brady.
The 35-year-old also posed for photos with actress Salma Hayek. I was so lucky to be seated next to RogerFederer last night at the met ball he is very nice and so funny when he is not playing tennis, she wrote on Instagram.
Federer enjoyed a remarkable start to 2017. The 35-year-old won his 18th major at the Australian Open in Melbourne in January before picking up ATP Tour 1000 victories at Indian Wells and Miami.
Fellow tennis star Serena Williams also attended the fundraising event in New York, having recently announced that she is expecting her first child at the age of 35.

## Title: Saracens aim for new European record against Clermont

Saracens aim for new European record against Clermont
LONDON: Saracens will aim to rewrite European rugby unions record books when the title-holders face Clermont in the Champions Cup final at Murrayfield on Saturday.
The London side are bidding to become just the fourth club to win back-to-back European Cup titles, after Leicester, Leinster and Toulon.
Victory would also see Saracens set a new outright record of 18 matches unbeaten in the Champions Cup, equalling the record they share with Irish side Leinster of 17, in both cases comprising 16 wins and a draw.
Saracens, also the reigning English champions and eyeing a double Double, could field six members of the British and Irish Lions squad -- the largest number supplied by any one club -- for the combined sides upcoming tour of New Zealand.
That England sextet of Owen Farrell, Billy Vunipola, Maro Itoje, George Kruis, Jamie George and Mako Vunipola are all set to feature against Clermont after Saracens rested most of their stars for last weeks Premiership defeat by Wasps, having already booked their place in the title-deciding play-offs.
Saracens boss Mark McCall deployed just one of his Lions in the starting line-up against Wasps in Kruis, with Jamie George the only other to feature as he came off the bench.
Deadly attack
England lock Itoje was the man-of-the-match in Saracens Champions Cup final win over Clermonts French rivals Racing 92 last season.
This will be Clermonts third European Cup final, with the Top 14 side still looking for a first major continental title after twice losing to another French side in Toulon.
Theyve been close a few times but not quite done it, Itoje told Saracens website.
Theyre a big, physical team with a strong set-piece and a deadly attack as well. It will be up to Itoje and his fellow Saracens forwards to secure enough good quality ball so they can unleash backs of the calibre of ex-England wing Chris Ashton, who needs just one more try to take sole possession of the tournaments record of 36 tries that he shares with former France star Vincent Clerc.
Saturdays match will be Ashtons last in European competition with Saracens before he joins Toulon at the end of the season, having remained off the scoresheet in their semi-final win away to Munster.
Saracens will be without Scotland wing Sean Maitland (ankle)and prop Richard Barrington (hand) because of injury. They also have fitness doubts over tighthead prop Vincent Koch.
Losing Koch would be a blow given that, in the absence of the already sidelined Juan Figallo, he will be expected to anchor the scrum against Clermonts powerhouse front row Thomas Domingo.
But in any case, Clermont would do well to keep an eye on unheralded South African Michael Rhodes, a back-row who has also starred at lock this season while Kruis was out injured.
Meanwhile, Clermont received a boost earlier this week when scrum-half Morgan Parra and centre Remi Lamerat were passed fit by coach Franck Azema earlier this week.
Parra, 28, suffered a thigh strain and 27-year-old Lamerat a knee knock in the French clubs bruising semi-final win over Irish side Leinster (27-22).
Clermont are battling against their reputation as the nearly men of rugby, with their loyal Yellow Army of fans desperate to celebrate in Edinburgh.
Theyve won just one of their 12 Top 14 finals (in 2010), as well as suffering those two European reverses against Toulon.
But David Strettle, Clermonts former Saracens wing, told AFP: It doesnt affect me if Clermont have won or lost eleven, twelve finals.
I am playing just the one game, in my head it is the same. The players just have to ignore the history.
For the fans, its different.

Short-handed Spurs humble Houston to advance
Los Angeles: The San Antonio Spurs humiliated the Houston Rockets Thursday with a 114-75 game six closeout win that brought James Harden's MVP-worthy season to a startling halt.
LaMarcus Aldridge paced the offense by scoring 34 points for the short-handed Spurs, who routed the Rockets despite the absence of top scorer Kawhi Leonard and star guard Tony Parker.
"Everybody picked it up. It wasn't one guy scoring 40 points," said Spurs coach Gregg Popovich. "They played well at the offensive end with a lot of sense and defensively it was one of our best nights."
San Antonio won the second-round series in six games and punched their ticket to the Western Conference playoff finals against the Golden State Warriors, which kicks off on Sunday.
Harden's baffling performance in front of a Houston crowd of 18,050 at the Toyota Center arena was almost as big a stunner as the Spurs' winning a NBA playoff elimination contest by a whopping 39 points. The Rockets 75 points was second-lowest in a game during the Harden era.
And the Spurs didn't need Parker (torn left quadriceps) or Leonard (sore left ankle) to do it.
Jonathon Simmons added 18 points in place of Leonard, while Patty Mills chipped in 14 points and seven assists.
Pau Gasol tallied 10 points with 11 rebounds for San Antonio, which trailed 5-4 in the first quarter before coasting to the win.
San Antonio shot 53 percent from the field, compiled a 60-37 rebounding advantage and limited Houston to 28 percent shooting.
"They feel as bad as I do. It is going to hurt and linger," said Rockets coach Mike D'Antoni.
Harden was a non-factor Thursday after finishing second in scoring during the season at 29.1 points per game. He did not attempt a shot until the 6:19 mark of the second quarter.
Harden accepted some of the blame for the loss.
"I just didn't have rhythm," Harden said. "I was making passes and we didn't knock down shots.
"It falls on my shoulders. It is tough, especially the way we lost at home."
By halftime Harden had as many points as turnovers (five each), and just two field-goal attempts at the intermission.
Harden finished with 10 points on two-of-11 shooting with seven assists and six turnovers. Trevor Ariza paced Houston with 20 points, and Clint Capela had 15 points and 12 boards. Asked if Harden was injured, D'Antoni said, "He's been battling that cold, but nothing I know of. I don't want to litigate what just happened." Leonard hopes to return to action Sunday for game one of the NBA semi-final series. The Rockets had been 3-0 against San Antonio in postseason series, winning in the first round in 1980, the conference semifinals in 1981, and the conference finals in 1995. AFP

Silva service key to Man Citys Champions dream
MANCHESTER: David Silva's comeback from injury helped inspire Manchester City's return to form last weekend, and his fitness is likely to prove crucial to their Champions League qualification prospects.
Silva, back from a fortnight out with a knee injury, was superb as City beat an inept Crystal Palace 5-0, for only their third win in nine Premier League matches.
That victory has left Pep Guardiola's side fourth going into Saturday's home match against Leicester City, with a three-point lead over fifth-placed Arsenal and only the top four at the end of the season qualifying for the Champions League.
Sergio Aguero is making progress in his recovery from a groin injury, although it may be too soon for him to make a comeback. In any case, City's front three of Raheem Sterling, Gabriel Jesus and Leroy Sane were in fine form without him last Saturday, aided by the creativity of Silva and Kevin De Bruyne.
Seven points from their final three matches will guarantee City's place in next season's Champions League, a target they would be more than hopeful of achieving given that the Leicester game is followed by matches against West Bromwich Albion and Watford, both out of form.
Then again, reigning English champions Leicester were struggling when City visited the King Power Stadium in December, yet Jamie Vardy was still able to score a hat-trick in a 4-2 home victory.
Guardiola's side do look a little more settled now, though, with Vincent Kompany's return to fitness giving the defence a much more solid look. Kompany, troubled by a series of injury problems over the last three years, has completed 90 minutes in each of City's last five matches, suggesting that his troubles may finally be behind him.
City manager Guardiola is without first-choice goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, out for the rest of the season with a calf injury, but his absence hasn't hurt his team's prospects unduly, given the Chile international's erratic displays.
Willy Caballero's fine save from Christian Benteke in the first half against Palace showed he is a more than able deputy, and he will continue for the season's final three games.
Caballero had a run of Premier League matches for City between January and early April when Bravo was dropped, and remained philosophical when the former Barcelona goalkeeper was then recalled.
I tried to be focused when Claudio started to play again and I trained well, said Caballero. I kept my professionalism.
Unfortunately he probably can't play until next season but I trained really hard for this opportunity. Leicester have assured their safety in the Premier League with 22 points gained in 10 domestic games since Craig Shakespeare took charge following the surprise sacking of title-winning manager Claudio Ranieri.
But the current Foxes boss will have to complete his audition for a longer-term contract without midfielder Danny Drinkwater, who has been ruled out for the rest of the season.
Shakespeare could also face a crisis in central defence, where Robert Huth is a major doubt with a foot injury and captain Wes Morgan's hamstring problem will rule him out again.
Drinkwater has a thigh strain and I don't expect him to play again this season, said Shakespeare. AFP

Strict action against over-the-counter antibiotics selling
The Health Ministry will take stern action against selling antibiotics over-the-counter without a prescription from a qualified medical practitioner, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said.
"Using antibiotics unnecessarily should be discouraged.
Nearly 13 percent of health expenditure is on antibiotics, he said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching the National Policy on Antibiotic Resistance at the BMICH in Colombo recently.
Minister Senaratne said WHO had confirmed that antibiotic resistance has become a serious issue. Treating diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Tuberculosis (TB), and malaria among others has become a problem with the issue.
Many developing countries including Sri Lanka have focussed on reducing the use of antibiotics.
Antibiotics resistance is a concern in a developing country like Sri Lanka as they are used to control non-communicable diseases. Sri Lanka has signed the Jaipur Declaration on reducing the use of antibiotics to cut down using antibiotics unnecessarily. The National Policy on Antibiotics has been drafted in this regard, he said.

Trinity-Isipathana should provide the thrills
Pallekelle rugby ground is expected to be bursting at the seams packed with rugby fanatics today for the annual rugby clash between Trinity and Isipathana. A thrilling game of rugby is in store when the eagerly awaited confrontation between arches rivals in school rugby scrum down, which is also the third game of the second round for the two schools. Todays kick-off is fixed for 4.30 pm with Rohan Fernando handling the whistle. Both schools are great crowd pullers and in the past whenever they met have produced unrelenting brand of rib bruising rugby.
A repeat is expected today. The match itself should prove interesting as both teams will be out at full strength and will no doubt be seeking to grab it in their favor. As long as the Trinity forwards are left mobile it will be difficult for Isipathana.
This is the realization that has struck the Pathanians and the match strategy will be to run the ball at every opportunity.
It will not be easy for the Trinitians much will depend on their forwards who are experienced and tactically good players. In the first round it was a joy watching Trinitys attacking style.
They have quality players in almost every department. The Pathana pack too has been sound, if Trinitians can find the extra speed necessary, the Pathanians task will be harder.
The Trinity forwards are playing well and using their weight and height to good effect to gain possession. Today their power and superiority will be gauged against the equally strong Pathana forwards who should play tighter like they did last Saturday against the Thomians. Pathana three-quarters look formidable and are in good form.
They were impressive against the Thomians, disrupting quick ball and preventing them achieving any momentum until late in the game. They caused the Thomian forwards a lot of problems, and theyll do the same for Trinity.
Dharmaraja host Science at Nittawela
Today at Nittawela the high riding Dharmaraja ruggerites will play Science a game that should turn out in the Rajans favor. In the second round Rajans showed the exit door to both home town schools Kingswood and Vidyartha. If the Rajans want to win this match, they will have to play flawless rugby, mindful of the Science ruggerites ability to play the high ball to maximum benefit.
At present the Rajans forwards are a formidable lot playing together and are good in their rucking and driving. Science should use their line as they have some good runners.
Vidyartha, Kingswood in Colombo
Vidyartha who have lost both their second round matches to St. Anthonys and Dharmaraja will be in Colombo today to play D.S. Senanayake at Welisara. The D.S. boys should have things to their own liking - their forwards play hard and send the ball quickly out to the threes. Vidyartha fielding a very young outfit will be at full strength. Kingswood who lost the first second round game shocked the Antonians in their last encounter and should have their hands full today when they play Lumbini. Kingswood who possesses a glittering array of players will go all out for a win as they cannot afford to lose this game. Lumbini too are good and sure to give a good run to the Kingswoodians in their own den.
Kandy under 15 girls do well in swimming
Mahamaya Girls College gave an excellent performance at the National & Sub junior under 15 National Aquatic championships 2017 where they were placed first in the girls event. Gateway International School swimmers too did well to take the second runner-up place in the girls under 15 events.
St. Anthonys play Prince of Wales
The Antonians, who are smarting from the defeat they suffered at the hands of Kingswood last Sunday, will be hoping to salvage some of their lost pride when they clash in the second round Plate trophy rugby third game, with Prince of Wales on Sunday at Pallekelle.
The Antonians must be desperate to come out with a better performance. They had major issues in the team where ball handling; unforced errors led them to a tough defeat. In this game the Antonians must rely more on their speedy outsiders, for their bad luck their regular fly half Samuel Maduwantha who passed the century mark last season is out due to an injury, this is affecting them badly.
Nugawella-Ratnayake ends in a draw
The 14th cricket big match between Nugawella Central and A. Ratnayake Central ended in a draw at the Trinity College International Stadium, Asgiriya. Nugawella Central scored 210 with Chavishka Udalagama top scoring with 47, Devinda Dissanayake 38, and Kavindu Weerakoon taking 4 for 41 and, Dinuka Darshana 3 for 57. Ratnayake Central in their turn was all out for 170.
Imala Kodithuwaku was unbeaten on 67 and Lakmal Silva bowled to a line and length to take 7 for 63. In the second innings Nugawela Central were bundled out for 99 with Achala Bogodawatte making 38 while Dinuk Darshana took 7 for 35. A. Ratnayake had to score 240 runs to win but were struggling at 99 for 8 when the game ended. Kavinda Ratnayake made 21; Hasitha Gunawardena took 3 for 16 and Lakmal de Silva 2 for 35.
Weerasinghe best sportsman
V.V. Weerasinghe one of the finest chess players to come out of St. Sylvesters College was adjudged the best sportsman of the school. Weerasinghe is one of the top class chess players in the country and he is sure to do well with the proper guidance and backing.
Tickets are sky high at schools rugby
School rugby crowds could soon keep off from matches if ticket prices continue to rise. School rugby supporters say the present school match tickets are highly priced and Kandy schools rugby risks losing an entire generation of young fans. Rugby was more affordable at one time, now they have broken that habit.
The reason behind it is only Trinity has their own grounds for rugby. They give some schools free for matches when it is not used by them, schools like Vidyartha, Sylvesters, Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Sumangala, Anthonys and Rahula who have no grounds of their own for matches. Today schools have to spend nearly Rs. 100,000 as ground fee so naturally the gate fee goes up. From that too they have to pay a 25% entertainment tax. When schools play their matches at Bogambara due to hardness of the grounds there is lot of injuries.
73rd Bradby and Rugger Ball next Saturday
The first leg of the coveted Bradby Shield game is next Saturday at Pallekelle. This leg will be graced by former Trinity captain Tikiri Ellepola as chief guest. Royal and Trinity were the first elite schools to take up rugby, and the first historic match was played on 31 July, 1920.
The Bradby tally stands at Trinity 39 wins, Royal 31 and 2 tied. The Old Boys Association Kandy Branch will present their annual Rugger Ball, soon after the final whistle of the game at the Grand Kandyan Hotel.
The national cricket team at Pallekelle
The Sri Lanka cricket squad is at Pallekelle on a residential training programme in preparation for the June ICC Champions Trophy tournament in England. On Tuesday they visited the Temple of the Tooth.
Kandy football
Does anybody care for Kandys Football Kandy A.F.L. has not finished the 2016 tournament. Also the AGM is still not held.
Normally the AGM is held by the first week of March, now it is May. Football was tagged as the common man's game, and at one time the sport in Kandy saw huge crowds witnessing matches. Sad to say in the last couple of years football at club level is dead.
Samuel injured
Samuel Maduwantha, the Antonian fly half who was the highest point scorer last season, securing a total of over 100 points is injured and doctors have advised him to rest till the injury is healed. He has missed a couple of games and his absence is badly felt. Last season he kicked a 53-meter drop goal against Trinity at Pallekelle.
Basketball
In the all-Island schools under 15 girls and boys basketball tournament, which was a five-day tournament no Kandy schools qualified for the knockout stages. In the boys event the schools that qualified to play in the tournament were Kingswood, Al Azar and Gateway. Overall there were 20 teams.
Football for schools
The annual inter schools football tournament organized by the Education Department of Kandy Zone is expected to be played on May 15, 16 and 17 at the Bogambara Stadium and Al Jabar College grounds Galagedera.
Over 30 schools are expected to take part in all age groups. The organizing part is handled by the Education department officials.

US and China sign trade agreement

The US and China have reached a 10-point trade deal that opens the Chinese market to US credit rating agencies and credit card companies.
Under the deal, China will also lift its ban on US beef imports and accept US shipments of liquefied natural gas.
In return, Chinese cooked chicken will be allowed into the US market and Chinese banks can enter the US market.
US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross said the deal should reduce China's trade surplus with the US by the end of 2017.
Ross told CNBC that the US had agreed to treat Chinese financial institutions in the same way as other foreign banks that wanted to open up activities in the US.
"Clearly China, whose banks are among the largest in the whole world, wants access to the US banking market," he said.
"As long as they can comply with the normal rules, they will get access."
Softer approach
The deal marks the first tangible results of trade talks that began last month.
The agreement is seen as an indication that US President Donald Trump is adopting a less confrontational approach with Beijing than he promised during last year's election campaign.
Trump had threatened to label China a "currency manipulator" and impose trade tariffs on its goods, but has since softened his position.
He had also attempted to link US-China trade talks to concerns over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, urging Beijing to exert more pressure on Pyongyang.
However, after the trade deal was announced, China's vice-minister of finance, Zhu Guangyao, said economic issues should not be politicised.
"On the connection between the North Korean nuclear issue and our economic '100 days' plan' negotiations, I can tell you frankly that our economy team focused all their efforts on economic issues," he told journalists.
The criticism that foreign investors usually have of doing business with China is that typically it is China that benefits far more than the foreign business partner. That has been the rallying cry of President Trump on the campaign trail, and he has promised to get China to play by the rules.
This agreement looks set to at least give the impression that he is doing that. It certainly benefits the US by giving American financial services and American beef exporters more access to China's growing middle classes.
But China isn't one to give away something for nothing. In return, Beijing gets an important reshaping of its global image from the US.
No longer do you hear the words "currency manipulator" or "unfair trade partner" from Trump's lips. Instead, the US in a statement recognised the importance of China's One Belt and One Road initiatives, and even says it will send representatives to attend the summit - something previous administrations have thus far eschewed. China also gets to sell its cooked poultry products to the US - a market it has been keen to tap too.

Wasps attack funeral procession in Galaha
When a corpse was being carried to the Pupurassa cemetery in Galaha, a swarm of wasps attacked the coffin-bearers compelling them to leave the corpse aside and run.
A 10-year-old boy who ran fearing the wasps had fallen into the newly dig grave. Severely injured, he had been admitted to hospital. Altogether 12 persons had been hospitalised attacked by the wasps. The firecrackers that relatives of the dead used along the road to the graveyard could have threatened the wasps to attack the funeral procession, villagers said.

In 'The Zookeeper's Wife,' Entertainment Trumps Holocaust Reality [Video]

In The Zookeepers Wife, directed by New Zealander Niki Caro, Jessica Chastain plays Antonina Zabinska, who together with her husband Jan hid and saved the lives of over 300 Jews smuggled out of the Warsaw Ghetto. Chastain  one of <U+2028>todays leading American actresses, whom I like quite a bit, and who in this case also produced  chooses to perform her role in Polish-accented English. I dont understand why filmmakers persist in this practice; after all, English is supposed to represent the Polish that Antonina actually spoke, and surely she did not speak it with an accent. Does the Polish intonation of Chastains English make her character more <U+2028>believable
I focus on this seemingly trivial aspect of The Zookeepers Wife because it demonstrates the overall conventionality with which Caro presents the Zabinskis story, itself well worth commemorating. Antonina and Jan (played by Flemish actor Johan Heldenbergh with an accent of his own) ran the Warsaw Zoo when the Germans invaded Poland and World War II broke out.
In the movies opening scene, we see the zoo in all its welcoming glory before the trouble begins. Chastain plays Antonina as a woman glowing with love for the animals under her care. Were she to burst into song like an animated Disney heroine<U+2028>while making her morning rounds, we almost would not be surprised. She also loves her husband and young son, who sleeps with two lion cubs by his side, but she doesnt seem to look at them with the same amount of emotion as she does, say, the elephants.
German bombs destroy the zoo. Some of the animals survive and flee to the streets of Warsaw; others are killed in the bombings or shot by <U+2028>German soldiers.
When the Jews of Warsaw are relocated to the ghetto, which strikes Antonina as just plain wrong  thats the movies main emotional register  she convinces her husband that they should hide her best friend Magda (Israeli actress Efrat Dor). This decision eventually leads to the couples further effort to get as many Jews as they can from the ghetto to the zoo, which is patrolled daily by German soldiers but is deserted at night. What makes this plan possible is Jans suggestion that Lutz Heck (Daniel Bruhl), a Nazi zoologist who takes over the zoo, turn it into a pig farm that will feed the German troops. The pigs themselves will eat the garbage of the ghetto, an arrangement that allows Jan to enter the ghetto with his truck and smuggle out Jews  first children and then adults, some of whom stayed at the zoo for only a few days, while others spent the entire war there.
Caro turns this story into a Holocaust melodrama that only barely touches on its horrific <U+2028>historical background; it offers two main protagonists that lack all depth. This is especially evident at the moment when Antonina and Jan decide to risk their lives, and the life of their son, by helping the ghetto Jews. This crucial turning point is presented casually; what interests Caro and her screenwriter, Angela Workman, who based the screenplay on Diane Ackermans best-selling nonfiction book from 2007, is only the heroic dimension of the act, not its motivations.

Do the couple decide to save Jews because they love animals, and therefore also people (Antonina says at one point that she has more faith in animals than in humans) We usually do not need an explanation for why a person performs a heroic deed; but because Antonina and Jan are so threadbare in the movie, we need to know a little more about what drives them. Since the director gives us such superficial characters and portrays their dangerous work in such a placid manner, her movie generates no suspense, even at its most fateful moments. The result therefore feels more like an adventure than the commemoration of the Holocaust through the Zabinskis story.
Emotional detachment
Caro, it seems, wanted to make a moderate Holocaust melodrama that offers inspirational entertainment without unsettling the audience too much  if at all. We do get a glimpse of the daily dangers faced by Antonina, Jan and the people they are hiding, as well as of the horrors occurring at the Warsaw Ghetto. The burning of the ghetto and the expulsion of its inhabitants are depicted with an odd emotional detachment. We even get to meet Janusz Korczak (Arnost Goldflam), who refuses Jans pleas that he join the fugitives at the zoo and instead boards the fateful train with his students.
But Caro and Workman seem more interested in the relationship that develops between Antonina and the Nazi zoologist, the movies arch-villain. Heck is drawn to Antonina and flirts with her; to protect her family and her secret mission, Antonina pretends to respond, which makes Jan jealous. This reaction, which suggests that Jan does not understand the difficulty his wife is negotiating, makes him out to be something of an idiot and limits our ability to identify with him.
The ghetto fugitives are an anonymous blur, but in keeping with the movies overall conventionality, Caro relies on the formula of bringing one of them into relief and letting her figure and story stand for the whole group. In this case, the focus falls on young Urszula (another Israeli actress, Shira Haas). After witnessing the girls rape by two German soldiers, Jan pushes her into his truck and brings her to the zoo, where she hides in a cage, unable to utter a word or even say her own name. With a banality that borders on kitsch, The Zookeepers Wife shows us Antoninas efforts to help the traumatized girl (with the help of an adorable bunny).
With the exception of this story, Caro might perhaps have deserved praise for trying to avoid excess melodrama and sentimentality. In this case, however, the avoidance is not really a virtue, because it serves the movies overall shallowness. There is something glitzy about The Zookeepers Wife, a predilection for elegance and even ostentation that emphasizes its lack of depth. Entertainment counts for more here than the memory of the Holocaust or the brave acts of the Zabinskis, as implied by Chastains appearance: no matter what kind of hardship she suffers through, she remains throughout a carefully designed figure in attractive clothes and aflattering hairdo.
Polish audiences may enjoy The Zookeepers Wife, which shows two of their own performing heroic deeds, hints that there were other good Poles like them, and sidesteps the role the Polish played in the war. Germans are the only bad guys here.
Any Holocaust movie is bound to be at least somewhat interesting for the contribution it makes  whether substantive or dubious  to the ongoing debate of the relation between the memory of the Holocaust and its cinematic representation. Ive written before about the problems involved in the many entertainment-minded Holocaust melodramas made in the wake of Schindlers List, which broke the dam and brought on the deluge. The Zookeepers Wife brings this problematic output to a new peak. It is not surprising, therefore, that the movies most thrilling scene involves not the atrocities inside the ghetto, the suffering of the refugees hidden in the zoo, or the dangers threatening Jan and Antonina, but rather the heroines rescue of a newborn elephant whoalmost chokes to death.
