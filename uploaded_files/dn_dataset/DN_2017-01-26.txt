PUCSL to expedite grid connection of domestic solar plants
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL), has directed the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) and Lanka Electricity Company Private Limited (LECO) to connect domestic rooftop solar plants to the national grid within two weeks from the date of application.
The direction to provide the connection for rooftop solar plants to the national grid in an efficient manner within a time fame will encourage people to move for solar power, Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka Director General Damitha Kumarasinghe said.
Sri Lanka aims to add 200 mw of solar electricity to the national grid by 2020 and 1000 mw by 2025.
The PUCSL advised the distribution licensees (CEB and LECO) to expedite grid connection process of domestic rooftop solar plants within a time frame of two weeks. PUCSL asked CEB and LECO to ensure completion of the grid connection and signing the Net metering, Net accounting or Net Plus agreements within the time frame. Sri Lanka has 7904 domestic rooftop solar plants that are installed and connected to the national grid, data up to Novemeber 2016. This includes 256 rooftop solar plants in Southern province, 4806 plants in Western province, 184 plants in Central province, 105 plants in Sabaragamuwa province, 249 plants in North Western, 98 plants in North Central, 1707 plants in Northen province, 32 plants in Uva province and 73 solar plants in Eastern province.
The total domestic rooftop solar plants before the Soorya Bala Sangramaya (the energy battle for solar) stood at 6485 and increased to 7905 by end November 2016.
1420 domestic rooftop solar plants were added through Soorya Bala Sangramaya by end November 2016.
Generation of electricity through renewable energy sources has become a major concern for government as well as private sector investors.
The Government policy is to increase the existing 50 percent of the electricity generation based on the renewable energy sources to 60 percent by the year 2020 and to increase it further up to 70 percent by the year 2030 and to generate the total energy requirement through renewable and other indigenous energy resources by 2050.

Rakna Lanka to appeal against order to pay Rs. 840 m. to Avant Garde
The Rakna Lanka Security firm is reported to have engaged Arul Chaw and partners, a legal firm in Singapore to appeal against an order issued to it by the SIAC, a commercial arbitration council in Singapore, to pay a sum of Rs 840 million to the Avant Garde Maritime Security firm.
Attorney Chandana Jayasundera has been appointed by Rakna Lanka to co-ordinate matters concerning this appeal with Arul Chaw and partners.
Reports said the Singapore law firm had quoted 20,000 Singapore dollars as its charges to appear in this case in an agreement signed with Rakna Lanka Ltd. But, later it had increased its charges to 30,000 Singapore Dollars. Rakna Lanka is reported to have agreed to this increased amount.
A highly placed officer at Rakna Lanka Limited said the Arbitration Board had given the earlier decision as Rakna Lanka had failed to retain any lawyers during the initial hearing of the case. This lapse had occurred due to the negligence on the part of two of its former high officials.

Religious Destinations: Serenity personified
Branching off from the Colombo - Galle Highway, a few yards away from the Dehiwala Municipality, located in a central position is Pinwatta Purana Viharaya.
The 'Pinwatta Pinbima' as the name suggests, is a well-known temple beaming with religious fervor where Sinhala Buddhist culture is kept alive and continues to nourish.
This is a well-renowned ancient temple, rich in tradition making a valuable contribution to Buddhists in and around Dehiwala. It continues to be greatly admired today for the service it renders in diverse ways. All the requisites of a temple are found within its premises. The solidly constructed decorative entrance with a sense of cultural identity and the Buddha statue in front invites you to an atmosphere of worship.
Wave of change
The present Nayaka Thera Ven. Walhaputenne Nandasumana has created a wave of change, adding essential requisites for the functioning of the temple which has grown tremendously popular in all aspects.
Within the premises, it has a multitude of buildings. As you enter, on the right is the Dhamma Salawa replacing the old one. The foundation was laid by late Ven Kuruwita Padumasiri Thera. The planning was later continued by the Ven Nayaka Thera retired from Ananda College, Colombo, where he rendered a great service in organizing Buddhist activities. He went ahead with the completion of the building replete with a well ventilated and spacious hall for the comfort of devotees for their monthly sil campaigns and other religious events. Upstairs is utilized for the Dhamma School and for offering alms to sil observers on Poya days. His next attempt was the construction of the Sanghawasa.
A few yards away from the Dhamma Salawa is the newly built Sanghawasa  a remarkable achievement. Devout Buddhists rose to the occasion and gave financial assistance to the Nayaka Thera to carry out this great mission. With their donations, he was gloriously successful in constructing this honoured place for the Sangha. The Saghawasa, built combining the old and new styles merging with the landscape is the residence for monks who focus their attention to the religious welfare of the people under the guidance of the Ven Nayaka Thera. The other places are the chaitya and the sacred Bo Tree. The age old chaitya is set in the centre of the temple compound. The only thing missing was the 'Ranveta' encircling the historic Bo Maluwa to the left of the ancient Vihara Geya.
Bodhiya with Ranveta
His next task was to put up a Ranveta (a golden fence) around the Bo maluwa with the support of the Dayaka Sabha and well-wishers. The Nayaka Thera performed the honoured task. The Buddha statue which was already there behind the Bodhiya with its branches spreading out is stunningly serene. The Ranveta is built surrounding the sacred Bo tree. The lower wall of the golden railing is decorated with sculptures including scenes of events from the life of the Buddha. A serene statue of Sanghamitta is also found there. Finally, the most striking feature is the neatly and solidly built seating provisions for the devotees to perform Bodhi Poojas, at their convenience. The other important feature is that the entire premises is kept meticulously clean.
Dhamma school
The historic temple also plays a vital role in making a tremendous contribution to religious education. The temple is of special significance as an ideal Dhamma school attracting parents as a place for their offspring to be good citizens with excellent discipline. One can ensure that the future generation who come under the influence of the Sangha here, will uphold religious values and human dignity.
Sri Upananda Daham Vidyalaya, named after the founder is said to be one of the best Dhamma schools in Dehiwala renowned for its standards. At present, the school headed by the Nayaka Thera with a large, qualified staff, renders a great service to a large number of students in and around Dehiwala. The prize giving held annually is an outstanding event put into action in perfect order. They perform perfectly exhibiting their talents. The commemoration of the 60th anniversary at its annual prize giving was held on January 25, 2015. It was a historic event and an important milestone.
Pious Pirivena
Named after the founder Ven Sri Sumanatissa Thera in the mid 20th century is the other most important institution, the pirivena. The creation of a true Buddhist monk is the ultimate objective and this is home to many a pupil who comes from distant areas. The Nayaka Thera has played a unique role in inculcating Buddhist moral values in the Sangha. Foremost is the discipline, care and sympathy towards the Bhikkus-to-be, especially the younger Bhikkus. The temple provides a vast array of benefits in a serene atmosphere. Senior Bhikkus who have received ordination give much support and strength to the Nayaka Thera in all Dhamma activities.
One can see how the temple progressed under different Theras. The founding of the temple is attributed to Ven Upananda Thera and his pupils, late Ven Kahawatuduwa Hemasiri Thera and Ven Kuriwita Padumasiri Thera, the steadfast monks who continued to upkeep the place as best as possible since its inception.

Rock on!
Singer, composer and producer Chitral Chity Somapala is a flame that burns bright. Outstanding Personalities features Chitral who prefers to let his powerful music do the talking.
Q. Chitral you are a hard rock, heavy metal and power metal vocalist. Why do these forms of music appeal to you Why are you passionate about these forms of music
A. As a teenager Ive been into this type of music because Ive always wanted to do something different than the regular music in Sri Lanka. Im passionate about it because of the complexity of various rhythms and then again this music comes from western classical music.
Q. You have performed with European power metal bands such as Firewind, Power Quest, Avalon, Faro, Red Circuit and Civilization One, Rekuiem and Domain. These are powerful bands. What was it like performing with them It must have been an exciting and tremendous experience performing with them
A. Yes Indeed, I had a responsible role in all these bands, not only as a lead singer because I was involved in composing melodies, writing lyrics and album concepts. We toured all over the world as a support for well -known acts and also we did Headliner Tours and gained positive criticism.
Q. You released your Sinhala track Nadee Ganga in 1998. What kind of impact did that have on your career
A. I never expected that it would go that far. Initially I refused, because Ive never sung in Sinhala till that moment, but then again my wife said just go for it, you never know, and that is the result!
Q. Chitral, what really inspires you to perform From where does this incredible talent come from
A: I love art and music. When performing I dont think about fame like some other artistes. I completely get lost inside my soul and thats the outcome. To put it simply it is my dedication and love for music.
Q. You come from a musical family. What kind of influence did that have on your formative years
A. As a teenager I wasnt into music at all, I was just a listener. My parents never influenced us to do music, but somehow it happened, because I always felt music has a specialty and I always wanted to be different from the others with what I did.
Q. At the age of 17 you entered the nightclub circuit in Colombo. At such a young age, did you feel a certain amount of pressure
Yes a bit. Senior Western musicians were fascinated by my talent, and that was a great learning experience engaging with the experienced ones.
Q. In 1985 you joined the Sri Lankan band Shock. Was that the point in your career when you seriously considered entering hard rock, heavy metal and power metal
I still say that playing with Diliup Gabadamudalige, I learnt a lot about differences in music. We played all original songs written by him in this band, and then I was able to write my own baselines with his guidance. All in all, that opened doors for my career to be an overall musician and not just a sideman.
Q. You joined Avalon, a German power band as front man and lead singer. Avalons third album, Vision Eden, went viral receiving excellent reviews. The Vision Eden tour saw Avalon as a support act for bands such as Hammer Fall, Uriah Heep, Metallica, Motrhead, Royal Hunt, Pink Cream 69, and many others. During the summer of 2000, you participated on Avalons 4th album Eurasia. What was it like performing on this tour Was that a defining moment in your career
A. That was the turning point of power metal in the world. We performed in so many great festivals and then we also became the best newcomer band in Netherlands and we became the band of the month in France on so many fanzines and I must say it was great.
Q. Who are the musicians you admire Who are the musicians who have inspired you and are there any songs that you have listened to that stands out in your mind
A. I admire all good musicians from classical music, jazz, rock, new age, film-scores to everything under the sun. The boundaries are limitless, but then again I dislike fake musicians and musicians who are greedy for commercialism.
Q. What do you consider the milestones in your life Chitral The milestones you have achieved in your career
A: Im a person who loves nature. Im a very simple person but I dont like fake people and I always try to get rid of them and just mind my own business. Im a very straight forward person too. To me, life is a circle and its a never ending learning process.
Q. What do you consider thesignificant achievementsin your career
A. To be on stage with great human beings and great musicians, then I feel that Im embracing the entire world.
Q. What is yourmessage tothe youth
A. Not to be swollen headed, learn about life everyday and respect elders.
Q. Apart from music, what arethe other pursuits and hobbiesin your life
Cooking is a big hobby in my life. I love cooking Sri Lankan meals because its very authentic and each one of us have different methods and that shows we are all different people.
Q. What are yourexpectationsfor the future
Peace to the entire world, let us stop hatred, stop racism, because human beings are so fragile and we are all the same, except certain religions and races have separated us. But then again our hearts should beat as one and we should come together as one.

Entrance is free for all. The Concerts performances will include a wide range of orchestral music, from Compositions from the Baroque Era, to Modern classics.

The pieces for the evening will be conducted by three well-known individuals in the field of music: Bernard Wacheux, Prof. Ajit Abeysekera and Srimal Weerasinghe.
[Bernard Wacheux, Prof. Ajit Abeysekera and Srimal Weerasinghe. ]
Our Special Guest Conductor for the evening, Bernard Wacheux, is a well-known French Conductor and Violinist as well as a Saxophonist, who started his career in Germany with the orchestras of Frankfurt and Koblenz. He is an avid jazz lover, has appeared on many multi-national TV programmes, and has been leading the French Soloists orchestra of France for 10 years. Prof. Ajit Abeysekera is a performing member of the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka. He was also one of its conductors from the year 1996 to 2016. He is an Old Royalist as well as an Emeritus Professor of Chemistry at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Srimal Weerasinghe, currently performs as the Principal Oboe of the National Youth Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Colombo Wind Orchestra, while he also performs regularly at the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Chamber Music Society of Colombo. His Career as a Conductor began in 2015, under the guidance of Manilal Weerakoon. He is the Assistant Conductor of the Junior Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka, and a Music Teacher and Conductor at The Music Project. The RCWO emerged 1st Place at the All Island Western Music & Dance Competition  Orchestra Category in both 2015 and 2016 under his baton.
The Concert will feature a variety of compositions, from Classical Masterpieces to Famous Movie Soundtracks. From the Classical Era, the RCWO will be performing March in C (KV 408/1) & Overture to The Marriage of Figaro by Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, as well as Symphony No. 5 in C Minor  Finale (Op. 67) composed by Ludwig van Beethoven and arranged by Ralph Matesky. The Royal College Choir will be joining the RCWO for their performances of For unto Us a Child Is Born from Messiah Part 1  Scene 3 by George Frideric Handel and Time To Say Goodbye by Andrea Bocelli. The Performances will also include Slavonic Dance No. 01 (Op. 72) by Antonin Dvorak, Gabriels Oboe (Theme from The Mission) by Ennio Morricone, which will feature a Solo Performance by Oboist Srimal Weerasinghe, as well as Danno Budunge by Vishwanath Laoji.
Founded in 1999 with the consent of H.L.B. Gomez, the principal of Royal College at the time, the Royal College Western Orchestra, since its inception, had had several trainers from the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) as well as the National Youth Orchestra (NYO). The orchestra held its first public performance in 2002, conducted by Prof. Ajit Abeysekera, a conductor at the SOSL. Amal Abeysekera was the concertmaster of the orchestra. After a prolonged hiatus, the RCWO was re-established in 2015, with Srimal Weerasinghe as the Conductor and Priyanthi Sudusinghe as the Teacher-in Charge. Nisal Jinadasa was the concertmaster. Its first performance was at the All Island Western Music & Dance Competition 2015, where it competed against some of the best school orchestras of Sri Lanka and secured 1st Place.
Soon after the All-Island Competition, the orchestra began to perform at a variety of events. The year after, the RCWO was invited to perform at the 137th Battle of the Blues Media Conference, which was the springboard to our continued success. The orchestra performed Amigos Para Sempre as well as the School Anthems of Royal College and St. Thomas College, along with the Orchestra of St. Thomas College, Mt. Lavinia, as well as the renowned De Lanerolle Brothers. More performances soon followed, with the orchestra being invited to perform at the Annual Colours Awarding Ceremony 2015 and theAnnual Band & Orchestra Concert of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda. Getting to the point where the Orchestra is at present was by no means a cakewalk. The process of reviving a defunct school orchestra: from catching the attention of Western Music students at school to being able to emerge as Champions at the All-Island Western Music and Dance Competitions only a few months after commencing rehearsals was extremely strenuous and yet, after facing all obstacles and shining through, the radical idea of organising an orchestra concert was brought up. The RCWO made the bold decision to take on the task of making this dream reality in order to add to the success of the Orchestra as well as solidifying its reputation as one of the best of its kind.
During the weeks leading up to the Concert, sectional practices were carried out for String Section by Dilpahan Mallikarachchi, a Professional Music Teacher who also performed at the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka and the Krasna Chamber Ensemble, while Wind Sectional Practices were carried out by Toshiaki Kamada and Sugath Weerasekera. Our heartfelt gratitude goes out to these few individuals who worked tirelessly to improve the quality of each section, putting aside their busy schedule and committing themselves to the betterment of the orchestra.
The Royal College Choir and the Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, will be joining with the RCWO as our guest performers. The RCWO performances of For unto Us a Child is Born from Messiah Part 1  Scene 3 by George Frideric Handel and Time To Say Goodbye by Andrea Bocelli, as well as the School of our Fathers, composed by H.L. Reed and orchestrated by Manilal Weerakoon, will be accompanied by the Royal College Choir. The choir trainer is Sureka Amerasinghe. The Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, directed by Naveen Fernando, will be performing a set of pieces from classics to pops.
Join us on the 28th of January, 6.30pm onwards at the Royal College Main Hall, and witness the joy of music as the Royal College Western Orchestra, together with the Royal College Choir and the Orchestra of Lyceum International School, Nugegoda, explores the orchestral masterpieces of many brilliant composers from the Classical era to the Modern Period, at the RCWO Annual Concert 17. Entrance is free for all.

RTC gallops into new year with races and aces
With 2017 into its third week the Royal Turf Club in Nuwara Eliya (RTC) is well set to put into practice all those new year resolutions that they had set for themselves.
The welfare of the horses has always been the highest priority for RTC. It is with this in mind that the Wish List put up by the resident veterinarian Dr. Balaji was immediately granted. A portable xray machine and a scanner are the latest additions to the Veterinary Hospital. Both are state of the art and the very latest and they will be of tremendous help in diagnosing ailments and injuries. It will provide Dr. Balaji with just the sort of technical support a good doctor needs to take his practice to an even higher level. To put it in a nutshell the horses can expect the very best when it comes to medical care which is so very important for keeping horses in the best of health.
Horse and rider go hand in hand and each compliments the other. The RTC has always realised the importance of creating local riding talent and promoting the cause of local Sri Lankan jockeys. You need the right instructors and along with that you need equipment.
The RTC could not have a better man to impart the right knowledge to young aspiring champions than the Indian riding ace Sinclair Marshall . A top jockey in his own right Sinclair lives and breathes horses and still rides out every morning. The wealth of knowledge and experience that he has accumulated over the years is incomparable. He's got the patience and the inclination to teach and to assist him the RTC has brought in a riding simulator and since the arrival of the simulator the jockeys have been exercising on the simulator to improve their posture, balance, fitness in the art of riding, as well as finish off their performance in a polished and professional manner. The simulator will allow budding riders to learn and hone their skill on a machine which simulates the action of a thoroughbred racehorse at full gallop. Apprentice Jockey Training Schools the world over have the simulator as a mainstay and now the RTC joins the ranks of these elite few.
The manufacturer of the simulator Richard Perham, coach at the British Racing School, New Market UK, says "Whether it is used to teach young riders the art of riding a finish or for champions to warm up before race riding, the simulator is a must."These lads are going to be the Sri Lankan jockeys of the future. The winter chill has seen Nuwara Eliya covered with a layer of frost every morning.
It may have kept the locals indoors but it hasn't deterred the horses from being exercised on the track every day as they set about getting ready for the new years racing season which kicks off in February and then goes all the way till End April. The next race days are February 11 - Independent Race Day, followed by April 2,16 and 29.

Sampanthan makes common cause
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan has often been accused of speaking only on issues affecting the people of the North. This voicing of sentiments only of a particular people or community naturally attached the racist label onto him and other members of the TNA. There were misgivings across the political spectrum if the octogenarian politician would fit the bill as an effective Opposition Leader whose primary interest lay in voicing the grievance of the Tamil people to the exclusion of all national issues.
On Tuesday though, in parliament, Sampanthan strayed from the beaten track and touched on a topic that has been the talking point of the nation as a whole - corruption. The Opposition Leader lashed out at all governments since independence for doing nothing about corruption. All governments present and past defend the corrupt he said. He said people who are patently guilty are not punished. Is there anyone who was punished by a court for corruption There is no one. You are just fooling the people the Opposition leader noted. Sampanthan said political parties hit out at each about corruption, but when one party is defeated and replaced by another, corruption continues. There is finger pointing at each other but nothing happens, he said, adding that the people were getting sick of this situation.
Corruption by politicians of all hues is not a recent phenomenon and had been accepted as a matter of course since the dawn of independence, although it must said that corruption in the past pales into insignificance when considering its scale and scope in the present day. In the past, corruption was largely confined to what is called santhosams where a politician may have received a consideration for a favour granted. Corruption was by no means macro, as it is today, where the illegally amassed wealth of politicians are stashed away in foreign banks. But there is no denying that there was corruption in the past too, but these did not get exposed, as is the case today.
Sampanthan mentioned the names certain post independence politicians such as D.S. Senanayake, Dudley, SWRD and Srima as examples of politicians who were untainted by corruption. But corruption did exists under their rule, engaged in the by the lesser minions, of which, those mentioned above may or may not have been aware of. Particularly the era of the 1970-77 United Front Government under Mrs Bandaranaike was marked by large scale corruption involving members of her government and which formed the chief plank of the UNP election platform in 1977. But corruption soared to new heights under the Jayewardene government, with the liberal economy adding grist to the mill for corrupt acts. JRJ increased the salaries of his Ministers and MPs on the basis that this would keep them out of temptations way. But corruption thrived on an unprecedented scale, with top ministers in his government named in many of the crooked deals.
This state of affairs gave CBK and her team to come up with an attractive and very effective slogan of eradicating dooshanaya and bheeshanaya in her general election campaign. But the situation only turned for the worst with corruption getting institutionalised and the trail leading even to the very top echelons of power.
Corruption, needless to say, became a way of life under Mahinda Rajapaksa and for the first time in post independence Sri Lanka, an oligarchy ruled the country which apportioned for itself 70 per percent of the national budget. What is more, the chief anti corruption body was paralysed while the Attorney Generals Department was taken under the wing of the chief executive, putting paid to any attempts to rope in the corrupt. No wonder, no politician has so far been convicted for corruption by a court of law, as Sampanthan says. Even at present, we see Opposition politicians only being paraded before the various commissions. Whether they will actually be convicted is another matter. No wonder politicians are being described as a special breed.
The Opposition Leader said accusations have also being hurled at the Yahapalanaya government. True, but it is too early to say to what degree this will be taken, although it is already tainted with issues such as the bond scam, against which even government functionaries have spoken out openly.
Hence corruption is deeply ingrained in the countrys body politic where no party or government could claim innocence. Try as they might, no leader will succeed in combating corruption if it is done in a halfhearted manner. A steely will is required by those at the helm to rid the body politic of this canker. But political imperatives sometimes make even leaders baulk at tackling this problem, the way it should be done. They tolerate the corrupt acts of party members for a multitude of reasons, chief of which is their ability to deliver votes at an election through popularity or muscle power. No anti-corruption body will dare pursue such individuals. Sampanthans outcry will hence remain a cry in the wilderness.

Should Sri Lanka adopt Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
During the past few years several data breaches have made global headlines. You may remember the Target Stores data breach in 2013 that put the credit-card numbers and personal information of millions of people into the hands of cybercriminals.
According to the court documents about 42 million people had their credit or debit information stolen.
Target subsequently agreed to pay $10 million to settle a class-action lawsuit related to the company's data breach. Further, the court documents showed hacking victims could get as much as $10,000 apiece. It cost Target over $162 million in 2013 and 2014.In a more recent case last year, banks in India will either replace or ask users to change the security codes of as many as 3.2 million debit cards in what's emerging as one of the biggest ever breaches of financial data.
The breach is said to have originated in malware introduced in a system, enabling fraudsters to access information allowing them to steal funds.
According to industry reports, payment card data made up 48% of data breaches investigated in 2012 and was also the second largest volume of records affected and payment card data targeted in 61% of breaches investigated in 2013. Commonly targeted industries includes Retail (45% of breaches), Food and Beverage (24% of breaches), Hospitality (9% of breaches), Financial Services (7% of breaches), Nonprofit (3% of breaches) around the world.
Many of the high-profile data breaches reported as complicated or sophisticated, when in reality, most occurdue to low-level, very basic security practices are overlooked. Credit card data breaches are becoming so frequent globally that related stories seem barely newsworthy unless they involve huge data leaks from major corporations.
But, for those impacted, even a small breach can be significant. Besides the aggravation of having to deal with fraudulent transactions, fraudulently exhaust out credit limits that prevent legitimate cardholders from using their cards until charges are detected and reversed, denied payments when an issuer cancels a card due to a suspected breach and fails to quickly notify the cardholder, and other payment issues, the stolen data can sometimes be used in various ways to commit non-credit-card-related identity theft.
In a survey conducted in the US, it was found that two-thirds of adults would not return to a business after a data breach. With the growing security awareness amongst the public, they are less likely to patronize a business which has had a security breach and hence customer confidence can affect the profitability of a business. The customers trust the organization with their card data when they make transactions.
When a security breach occurs, both parties are affected. Should an organization get breached, not only will they have to deal with the loss of data, but may also have to deal with fines and lawsuits from customers and other organizations. Data breaches cost organizations a lot in both money and customer confidence. The cost of replacing credit cards, paying fines, and paying compensations for what the customers have lost, investigation costs and audits.
Between 1998 and 1999, Visa and MasterCard report credit card fraud losses totaling 750 million US dollars which is an insignificant amount with compared to hundreds of millions of dollars in transactions processed annually. With the growing consumer comfort with online purchasing, merchants rolled out e-commerce websites and connected their payment processing systems to the internet. This encouraged fraudsters to capitalize on poorly protected systems from which the payments and card data can be stolen, making payment card fraud faster and easier than ever before.
Security risks became increasingly high with the increased instances of card-not-present transactions. These information security incidents and financial losses gave credit card companies an intensive amount of work towards implementing a solution to the problem.
PCI-DSS as a solution
With the rise in payment card data breaches globally, the need for a sophisticated security program aroused. In 2004, all the major credit card companies responded to this crisis by joining together to create a comprehensive security standard. Thus,Pioneer Payment Brands, namely, American Express, Discover Financial Services, JCB International, MasterCard and Visa Inc., formed Payment Card Industry Security Standards Council (PCISSC) in 2006.
Five different security programs; Visa's Cardholder Information Security Program, MasterCard's Site Data Protection, American Express Data Security Operating Policy, Discover's Information Security and Compliance, JCB's Data Security Program were similar in objective of creating an additional level of protection when the payment data is stored, processed or transmitted.
The founding members of PCISSC aligned and improved said existing internal information security programs to come up with a unified information security program. In this light, the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS) was created along with some of the other supporting standards such as PA-DSS, PCI-PTS and P2PE.
The PCI-DSS helps protect the safety of payment card data. PCISSC set the operational and technical requirements for organizations accepting or processing payment transactions, and for software developers and manufacturers of applications and devices used in those transactions.
The goal of the PCI - DSS is to protect cardholder data wherever it is processed, stored or transmitted.
The security controls and processes required by PCI DSS are vital for protecting payment card data and has specific rules for different businesses, based on the type of the business (processing, storing and transmitting of payment card data), depending on size of the organization measured in number of transactions.
Compliance is essential
Being compliant to the standard, can reduce these fines and also reduce the amount of lawsuits and liability an organization may incur. One has to prove that they were compliant for the fines not to be as bad if you were not making the effort.Hence, compliance is a top priority for merchants and organizations that process electronic payments. The standard helps issuers, acquirers, retailers and third party service providers to improve card data security. The standard was created so organizations could re-evaluate how they were actually using and managing cardholder information.
PCI-DSS specifies twelve different requirements for compliance, organized in to six different control objectives'.
1. Build and maintain a secure network
2. Protect cardholder data
3. Maintain vulnerability management program
4. Implement strong access control measures
5. Regularly monitor and test networks
6. Maintain information security policy
The execution of PCI compliance creates secure, regularly-assessed environments and processes surrounding the handling of payment card data during its processing, storage and transmission. This includes the protection of cardholder data at not only the point of sale, but during its storage and transmission in a cardholder environment. This includes both network access by external parties and internal access to system components in the cardholder environment.
As the PCI DSS demands the implementation of security standards for these environments and processes, complying with PCI security standards helps ensuring the safety of cardholder data. Additionally, PCI compliance requires regular assessment, remediation and the process of compliance facilitates better internal security strategies and can help prevent future problems.
Maintaining payment security is a serious business.
The card data of the customer needs to be protected by the organizations and the organizations are responsible for keeping the customer card data safe as far as the card data stored, processed or transmitted by the organization.While many organizations may not see the PCI-DSS as a necessary evil, it is important to both organisations and their customers that they follow the requirements.
After all, organizations are handling valuable information about their customers, and should the information get stolen, it has repercussions beyond just a simple theft.It is vital that every entity responsible for the security of cardholder data diligently follows PCI - DSS. Unlike any other prevailing security standard, the PCI-DSS requires 100% compliance with the standard if not penalties could be enforced by Payment Brands to the organizations who are in non-compliance with the Standard.
Following PCI guidelines goes a long way to securing payment data. Doing so assures customers and vendors that financial information is protected to the highest standard against identity theft and fraudulent purchases.
Situation in Sri Lanka
In Sri Lanka, organizations have been paying attention to physical security in their businesses, but are they dedicating enough time and effort to protect the information digitally The cybercriminal is not concerned about which part of the world you're in and is looking for the easy pickings.
The standard is not only applicable to websites that accept and process credit cards but also that outsource the processing of credit cards to third parties, if they accept credit card payments over the phone, or even in person. So there is still a lot of work to be done to make organizations become more aware of their responsibilities and obligations when accepting credit cards.And if we can enable our small merchants to make the right decisions by using the guidance that has been published, then that will protect and contribute toward protecting the small merchants as well.
Until the PCI-DSS is adopted in Sri Lanka, Sri Lankan organizations will struggle to comply with varying security standards in various international markets especially with regards to payments. This drive toward having a single standard for the payment industry should be everyone's interest especially those who want the electronic payments landscape to grow within the country.
The security benefits associated with maintaining PCI compliance are vital to the long-term success of all merchants who process card payments. This includes continual identification of threats and vulnerabilities that could potentially impact the organization. Most organizations never fully recover from data breaches because the loss is greater than the data itself.- Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) Magazine

Sister act as Serena, Venus eye family final
Melbourne: America's Williams sisters can write another chapter in their eventful family history as they attempt to set up their ninth Grand Slam final, eight years after the last, at the Australian Open on Thursday.
In a plot straight from the 2000s, both sisters have raced into the Melbourne semi-finals without a dropping a set, and they appear equally focused on getting their hands on the title.
At least one American is guaranteed to be in Saturday's decider, with Venus confronting confident compatriot Coco Vandeweghe in their last-four clash on Rod Laver Arena.
Following them on court will be Serena against fellow former teenage prodigy Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, who is into her first Grand Slam semi-final in 18 years.
It has become a tournament of the golden oldies, with Venus 36, Serena 35 and Lucic-Baroni 34. Vandeweghe at 25 is the young pretender.
Serena said it was a testament to the Williams' staying power that they were still fighting for titles at their age.
"I've been doing this for many years. The past few years I've been super-consistent," she said. "But yeah, I'm just really happy for Venus, obviously. She's doing amazing.
"I'm really happy for Mirjana, as well. I was there when she first started. To see her be able to never give up actually is super-inspiring to me. It's a wonderful story."
Few would have picked a Serena-Venus final as the tournament got underway, but it is now a 50-50 chance.
They last met in a major decider at Wimbledon in 2009, which Serena won. The younger Williams has the clear edge, winning six of their eight Grand Slam final encounters stretching back to the US Open in 2001.
Venus said she was not interested in the past, only the future and the immediate threat posed by the aggressive Vandeweghe.
"Anything that's happened before is just so. I'm ready for the future, if I can be honest," she said.
"I have a lot to give. I have a lot to give to the game. I feel like I have a lot of great tennis in me. I have nothing to lose, literally."
Vandeweghe is a major threat to an all-Williams final.
She demolished French Open champion Garbine Muguruza in a blitz of big hitting to make her first Australian semi, and she is supremely confident to boot.
"It's amazing to be in a semi-final. But, you know, not satisfying," said Vandeweghe, who also stunned world number one Angelique Kerber in round four.
"I want to keep going, keep playing. There's more things to do out on a tennis court that I'm hoping to achieve."
Brave Lucic-Baroni will have crowd support in her showdown with Serena after upsetting fifth seed Karolina Pliskova to make her first Slam last four since Wimbledon in 1999.
The unseeded Croat was among a crop of teen talents emerging at the same time as the Williams sisters in the 1990s, along with Martina Hingis and Anna Kournikova.
But an abusive father, money issues and injuries derailed her career.
She is happy to have got this far, and ready to put her aching body through another test against Williams.
"Serena is our greatest champion, for sure, the greatest tennis player that ever played the game. So it's going to be incredibly tough," Lucic-Baroni said.
"I'm just going to do my thing like I've done before, every other match. I'm going to go out there with my heart and do the best that I can." AFP
I can go the distance, says Dimitrov
Melbourne: Grigor Dimitrov says he has what it takes to upset the odds and go the distance at the Australian Open after storming past David Goffin and into the semi-finals on Wednesday.
The 15th-seeded Bulgarian had few problems in a 6-3, 6-2, 6-4 win over the Belgian 11th seed in two hours, 13 minutes on Rod Laver Arena.
Next up is either third seed Milos Raonic or 14-time Grand Slam champion Rafael Nadal in Friday's semi-final, but Dimitrov believes he's ready to land his first major title.
"I feel like I have all the tools to go further and my job isn't over yet," he said. "I'm looking forward to my match. I think I'm prepared.
"I think I'm ready to go the distance. I don't shy away from that. I'm confident enough to say that as I feel good physically, and overall on the court."
The win also equalled Dimitrov's career-best winning streak of 10 matches after his lead-up tournament win in the Brisbane International, where he beat world number five Kei Nishikori in the final. AFP

Softlogic Holdings tees off with junior golfer Taniya Balasuriya
One of Sri Lankas most promising young golfers is to be supported in her dreams of mastering the amateur circuit by the sponsorship of the Softlogic Group.
Fourteen-year-old Taniya Balasuriya of Sri Jayawardenapura Balika School is the latest beneficiary of the Softlogic Groups commitment to foster young Sri Lankan talent, a commitment which saw the Group take the countrys first Asian Tour professional golfer Mithun Perera under its wing in 2016. The Group has awarded Taniya a one-year golf scholarship commencing January 2017. The scholarship is to be administered through the Sri Lanka Golf Union (SLGU), the national body for golf in Sri Lanka, and her coach Jehan De Saram. Commenting on the sponsorship, Ashok Pathirage, chairman of Softlogic Holdings PLC said: At Softlogic we believe that talent scouting is vital, whether in respect of professionals or potential young sporting stars. As a Group we are committed to help nurture and grow worthy talented individuals in the arena of sports. I have the fullest confidence that Taniya will deliver results soon under appropriate guidance.
We believe Taniya has the potential to be a champion in the future and to contribute positively in moving Sri Lanka towards world class standards in the sport of golf. We have therefore decided to support her to improve not only her technical skills but also her physical training, nutrition and mental aspects. He said the sponsorship would also enable Taniya to participate in identified overseas tournaments to gain exposure to the standards of other junior players in Asia and gain valuable experience on courses in other countries.
Taniya, who started playing golf at the age of 10, currently holds a club handicap of 6. In her relatively short association with the sport she has notched up several noteworthy wins including the Ladies Sri Lanka Stroke Play Championship in 2015, the Regional and Sri Lanka Junior Open Division Championship and been ranked No. 1 in the Silver Division (Age Group 12  14 plus years) in the National Junior Rankings 2015. Among her recent achievements were securing a berth in the semifinals of the Sri Lanka Amateur Championship in 2016 where she finally succumbed to Thailands top seed.
Up to now, Taniya has been supported by the Royal Colombo Golf Club, the countrys oldest and most prestigious golf club and the SLGU, whilst Sri Lankas only qualified PGA professional coach Jehan de Saram has been providing her with the necessary basic skills and knowledge which has given her the confidence to move to the next level.
The SLGU is overjoyed that a prominent company like Softlogic Holdings PLC has taken this step to provide funding for our potential junior golfer Taniya and hope that others too will follow suit as we get into a more formal golf development program in schools, said Priath Fernando, president of the SLGU accepting the cheque for her scholarship fund. Softlogic Holdings PLC is one of Sri Lankas foremost, dynamic conglomerates, with leading market positions in the countrys growing economic sectors; retail, healthcare, ICT, automobiles, leisure and financial services. Softlogic holds Authorized Distributorships for key global brands and today, employs over 9,000 people in its offices located in Sri Lanka and Australia.

Sri Lanka has ignored competitive advantage in exports - Dr. De Silva
The governments intention to promote an Indian ocean order with rules based navigation freedom and overfly across the Indian ocean, will influence Sri Lanka to provide maritime security services and coordination in the region, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said.
Speaking at the 58th Annual General Meeting of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka, the Minister noted Sri Lankas future depends on how well the country leverages its geo- strategic location as an Indian ocean hub.
He said Sri Lanka has completely ignored its major competitive advantage, which is exports, over the last decade and as a result, the growth in total exports has slowed down compared to other nations like Bangladesh and Vietnam.
Sri Lankas share of exports as a percentage of GDP gone down from 35 % of GDP to 13% of GDP and the country is not earning anything in dollars.
In the meantime, global growth in trade has seriously slowed down, he said adding that between 1985-2007 period , the growth rate of global trade doubled that of global GDP.
Commenting on the implications of US Presidents election on the world economy, the Minister noted that people who are in the logistics business has already seen repercussions due to various actions taken by the Trump administration.
There is a nationalistic feeling sweeping across many countries significantly highlighted by the results of UK referendum to leave the European Union and the US Presidential election, he added.
He also noted that Sri Lanka needs to realise the importance of creating a knowledge based, highly social market economy in order to export products competitively in the global market.

Tea exports hit seven year low
Tea exports data released by Sri Lanka Customs shows shipments from January to December 2015 at 288.7 mnkg against 306.9 mnkg.
The last occasion the country exported less than 300 mnkg in a year was in 2009 following the previous years banking crisis and El-Nino drought that reduced supply in 2009. Similarly in 2016 tea production declined more than 40 mnkg against 2015.
With supply pressure starting Q4 2015 auction prices rose around mid-year. With tea prices up, total value of tea exports in 2016 rose to Rs. 184.7 bn against Rs. 182 bn during January to December 2015. This was inspite of quantity shipped dropping 6% to 288.7 mnkg against 306.9 mnkg the previous year.
Despite the higher Rupee earnings depreciation of the SLR played its part, as US Dollar earnings at approximately $ 1.26 bn were lower than 2015 earnings of $ 1.33 bn. Highest earnings in a calendar year was $ 1.63 bn in 2014.
Value added exports which include all tea other than shipments in Bulk form remains steady at 57% of the total. Shipments in Packets held at 47% of the total, but Tea Bag exports increased to 8% of the total compared with 7% the year before. Absoluteuantity shipped in Tea Bags was also higher at 23 m nkg compared with 22 mnkg the year before.
A review of destinations shows that the Russia and CIS cluster absorbed 53.6 mnkg against 55.9 mnkg the year before. Iran follows with direct imports of 33.9 mnkg against 30 mnkg a year ago.
Iraq 32.5 mnkg is also up YoY on the 2015 quantity of 31 mnkg. Turkey as a point of transshipment diminished in 2016 with quantities down to 27 mnkg form 33.7 mnkg a year ago. Similarly the UAE dropped from 23 to 18 mnkg.
Shipments to Libya almost entirely in packeted form increased sharply from 9.9 mnkg to 12.6 mnkg in 2016. Syria the other trouble spot was up 9% YoY 2015 to 11 mnkg to 12.1 mnkg. Of deep concern is the value of shipments to Japan that declined 8% from 8.4 mnkg to 7.7 mnkg. This is against a national export drop of 6%. China grewm marginally to 7.6 mnkg from 7.4 mnkg.
This is a good performance on a lower national total. Germany follows with imports of 6.8 mnkg against 6.9 mnkg. Followed by Chile importing 6.6 mnkg compared with 6.9 mnkg the year before. U.S.A shows a welcome improvement of 20% YoY 2015 with imports of 5.2 mnkg against 4.3 in 2015.

TPP withdrawal represents lost opportunity for exporters - Moodys
The US withdrawal from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal implies that the agreement will not be implemented.
We had anticipated TPP to reduce the cost of trade and open up new investment opportunities for its 12 members, and in particular, its Asian members, Moodys Investors Service Associate Managing Director,Marie Diron said.
The failure to implement the deal represents a lost opportunity for exporters aiming to gain greater access to major markets. Among the 12 member countries, the economies of Vietnam, Malaysia, Brunei and Mexico are reliant on exports and show the greatest exposure to trade with TPP countries. With this lost opportunity, prospects for significant large gains in incomes, for instance in Vietnam or Malaysia over the medium term on the back of higher trade will be reassessed.
Some countries have begun exploring other trade options, bilaterally or with China through the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP).
However, the potential trade deals currently envisaged are unlikely to provide as big an economic benefit as the TPP, where member countries accounted for 40% of global GDP.
In recent years, TPP trade negotiations served as a catalyst for reform, such as the reduction of protectionist policies in Japans agricultural sector.

Treasury Bond issue: Ravi says legal action should be taken against AG, staff for leaking sensitive report
Legal action should be taken against the Auditor General and his staff for leaking a sensitive report pertaining to the Treasury Bond issue to JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake and not giving the same to the Finance Minister on his request, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in Parliament yesterday said.
He made this observation yesterday making a statement on the tabling of a report of Auditor General in Parliament by JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake on Tuesday.
The Finance Minister said that the Auditor General had not provided him with the report and given it to JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake thereby breaching his privileges.
He added that MP Ratnayake on Tuesday said in parliament that the auditor general had given him the report.
It was a report that I had asked for, Finance Minister Karunanayake said. The report is a sensitive one containing secret information. The report states it is only for the eyes of Prime Minister, Finance Minister and the President. Only they are permitted to access such sensitive information. The Auditor General has given the report to the MP. He has done so even without putting it in an envelope.
The Finance Minister also said that the investigations with regard to this issue was still in progress. He added that this action tantamount to breaching his privileges. He also added that it was not upto the public servants to act in this manner.
This information had been released to the COPE Chairman and the Central Bank Governor, the Finance Minister said. However I had been not informed. These are very sensitive information with regard to the financial market.
He added that the Auditor General had acted in a manner which would lose secrecy of documents and their information. He added that such revealing of information would be detrimental to the Bond Market and the economy.
He also added that the Auditor General acted in an unprofessional manner.
I propose an investigation should be held to find as to how Auditor General procured those information to Parliamentarians, Finance Minister Karunanayake said.
This had been done without my approval. No other Auditor General had acted in such a manner before. Action should be taken against all officials who involved in this act.
Report tabled by me was not a copy given by AG: Rathnayake
The report tabled by him was not a copy that was given to him by the Auditor General but the same that was given to the COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti, JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake said.
He also said that the report of the Auditor General on the Treasury Bond issuances since 2008 to 2015 had been forwarded to the COPE Chairman, the Speaker, Finance Minister and Central Bank Governor.
He made these observations yesterday in response to the statement made by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake on the Auditor Generals report tabled by Bimal Rathnayake on Tuesday.
The report tabled by me was not a copy that was given to me by the Auditor General but the same that was given to the COPE chairman Sunil Handunnetti MP Bimal Rathnayake said.
Sunil Handunnetti was abroad and came on Tuesday morning to join the debate, MP Ratnayake said. He instructed me to study them on behalf of him.
He further said that he clearly stated in Parliament on Tuesday while tabling them that it was tabled on the instruction of MP Handunnetti. It is recorded in the unedited copy of the Hanzard too.
He also said that a letter by the Auditor General states that he was answerable to Parliament and not to the Finance Minister except on very specific matters that is mentioned in the Financial Act.
He added that the facts inquired by the Finance Minister do not come under the Finance Act.
He added that the Prime Minister has to look into the matter that several UNP MPs were in the habit of threatening the Auditor General continuously even during the COPE Committee.
However responding to MP Rathnayake, Minister Ravi Karunanayake demanded to know as to who had threatened the Auditor General.
He added the opposition had to reveal the members names who threatened the Auditor General without slinging mud.

Treasury Bond issue: Severe punishment for those responsible under criminal justice system: President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said he had appointed a Presidential Commission to investigate the Central Banks controversial Treasury Bond issue in March 2015 with the intention of meting out severe punishment to those involved in the scam under the criminal justice system.
Speaking at a function at the Abhayarama temple, Narahenpita yesterday afternoon the President went on to say that after bringing the culprits to book in the above case separate investigations will be launched to find whether similar malpractices have taken place involving the Central Bank during the last 7 to 8 years and punish those responsible.
The President said that he found out that a current Police investigation on the Bond issue was being conducted under the civil law and added that he was not satisfied about it.
A Presidential Commission can recommend to the Attorney General to initiate action under the criminal justice system, if an offence has been committed.
Commenting about the debate in Parliament on the Bond issue, the President noted that both the opposition and the government had resorted to a verbal battle accusing each other.
On the Presidential Commission, the President further said that he had appointed it after consulting and getting the views of renowned legal experts.
He said that Commission will investigate the issue in a very transparent manner. The President said that he will not allow any cover ups on corruption charges and added that he had left the previous regime as he could not tolerate corruption, malpractices and bad governance. Prior to the Presidents speech, Prof. Ven.BellanwilaWimalarathana Thera in his Anusasana brought up the bond issue and asked why the Government was hesitant to punish those responsible.

Why fear that H w o r d!
The Cabinet rejected the abrogation of Articles 365 and 365A of the Penal Code enacted in 1886. And the media has informed us that same sex relationships will remain a crime. Interestingly 365 and 365A does not specifically mention homosexuality or same-sex anywhere but only states (in 365): Whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal, and (in 365A): any act of gross indecency with another person. These are the only two phrases in these Articles that seem to have been interpreted as being sufficient to criminalize homosexuality. But, can these two phrases also refer to such acts by a heterosexual person And, has the law also set boundaries on consensual sexual intimacy
March in favour of LGBT rights
It is not clear who brought this before the Cabinet but it is clear that it was done without any attempt to disseminate all the rational information and research available refuting the argument that any sexual orientation other than heterosexuality is abnormal and must therefore be condemned and banned.
Rejection and discrimination
Homosexuality could be due to a combination of biological, psychological and environmental factors (nature and nurture). While new evidence (Skorska et al, 2016) explores the possibility that a maternal immune response might play a key role in the developmental of a homosexual orientation in males.
LGBT people in Sri Lanka
A significant percentage of homosexuals may have suffered traumatic childhood sexual abuse and/or a detached, distant, rejecting or absent father. They also often have very strong maternal bonds and are very sensitive, creative and caring human beings. Many are confused why they are not attracted to the opposite sex and often slip into depression and have suicidal feelings because of the rejection and discrimination they face. Some parents who detect same-sex-attraction in their children are convinced that marrying them off quickly is the best solution.
Homophobia must be replaced with actively listening to the life stories of LGBT people in a nonjudgmental manner. As a community there is so much we can learn and understand from them which will hopefully steer us to accept them unconditionally and importantly even help us to fully understand our own sexual orientation.
There are influential people in Sri Lanka who prefer to remain covertly gay because they are (understandably) unable to break free from the shackles of stigma, shame and ridicule. But they must know that, all will stand up and take notice if they decide to break free and speak out fearlessly about their orientation. They can create a significant and healthy change in the perception and acceptance of LGBT people in Sri Lanka.

The government will go into all the reports that were concealed by the former government with regard to its financial dealings, Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said.
Stating that the Bond issue proved the Governments transparency, the Minister said investigations are being conducted regarding the reports that were concealed by the former regime and they will be disclosed to the public.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department he said the Cope Committee Report has been presented to the Attorney Generals department to take legal action and a presidential commission also has been appointed to investigate into the issue.
Under the former government none of the reports were presented for an open discussion and they were all locked up. The chairmanship of any committee was not given to the opposition member. Today, many ask if the the government forgotten as to what happened to those reports. We are very well aware what happened to the Greek Bond, Hedging bond, the DEW Gunasekara report and many others, he said.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist about the delay in prosecution of wrongdoers , the Minister said there has been a delay but measures are being taken to quicken the process by appointing a commission.
Deputy Minister of Parliamantary Reforms & Mass Media Karunarathna Paranawithana said the investigations are being conducted to a greater extent. And added that the Attorney Generals department and the courts are responsible for it.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said several cases have been handed over to the Bribery commission, FCID and CID.
There is a delay in conducting the investigations. The Government does not interfere into these matters and this could be one of the reasons for the delay. Independent commissions carry out their duties independently under the present government, he said.
Minister Senaratne said the commissions failed to give prominence to the important cases but started investigating all the cases adding that this wasx one of points that even the Attorney General raised.
The Attorney Generals department had to face immense problems under the former government and it was fully controlled by the former president and it is not the same now, he said.
He further said the loss due to the Greek Bond was around 20 Billion and loss due Hedging agreement must be more than that.

Battle of wits
The political landscape in Sri Lanka is always in a state of flux and the week past was no exception, with developments in the opposition hitting the headlines.
Wimal Weerawansa of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna (JNP), whatever his faults, is a clever politician. He has the knack of converting any event to his advantage and this is what he did when he was detained and remanded on charges of misusing state property- over forty vehicles- which he allegedly distributed among family, friends and party officials.
Weerawansa complains that he is the victim of a political witch-hunt. That is ironic because a few months ago, he was claiming that the government had been unable to prosecute corrupt politicians in the former regime and challenged the authorities to do so. Now that he finds himself in the middle of a muddle, he is crying foul.
However, Weerawansa is not one to let such an opportunity slip by. He mobilised his party workers to be present when he was detained. They created a scene there. That was propagated through social media. Now, a series of posters have sprung up, hailing him as a hero.
Weerawansa knows that for someone with a short political stature such as himself, any publicity is good publicity, so he is making the most of his fifteen minutes of fame. It is the Lemon Puff death fast opposite the UN- all over again!
Presidential election
Another interesting development over the past week was parliamentarian Athuraliye Rathana Theras announcement that he would function independently in Parliament.
Rathana Thera was a livewire in the Jathika Hela Urumaya, led by Minister Champika Ranawaka. He too exited the Rajapaksa government, when Ranawaka defected to the Maithripala Sirisena camp at the 2015 presidential election. The vagaries of politics are such that he was nominated to Parliament at the 2015 general election from the National List of the United National Party (UNP).
Once a firebrand politician known for his forthright views and for expressing them forcefully, Ven Rathana Thera has kept a low profile in recent times. He obviously has some differences of opinion with the authorities but, despite functioning independently he is not about to get on a platform to lambast the government.
In fact, he clarified his stance, saying shortly afterwards that he will support and work for the government and will only make constructive criticism on some matters.
There was some speculation that the UNP will consider removing Rathana Thera from Parliament and replacing him with one of their own, but this is highly unlikely at this time.
Despite his decision to function independently, Rathana Thera is known to retain cordial relations with both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Joint Opposition parliamentarians
Another opposition politician to make a move was Piyankara Jayaratne. The Puttlam district parliamentarian, a former Deputy Speaker, had recently resigned from his portfolio of State Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils saying he wanted to work in a Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) only government.
At the time, his resignations raised many eyebrows. There was even speculation that more state ministers would resign. That did not happen. This week, Jayaratne chose to sit on the opposition benches in Parliament.
Jayaratne was seen walking into the chambers flanked by some Joint Opposition parliamentarians. There is every indication that he would announce his decision to support the JO shortly. If that happens, the Rajapaksa faction would command the support of 52 of the 95 parliamentarians elected under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) ticket at the last general election.
By far the most interesting development though was the meeting provincial Chief Ministers had with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa a few days ago. The meeting was thought to be crucial, especially in view of the upcoming Local Government elections.
There is an influential section within the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) which believes that the support of the former President is critical, if it is to succeed at the local government elections. This is not because Rajapaksas popularity is on the crest of a wave of popularity. Rather, it is because he has packed Local Government institutions with his loyalists over the ten years that he was in office.
These local councillors have held sway at the grassroots level for a decade and the name recognition factor works heavily in their favour, especially at a village level. The anxiety among a section of the SLFP is that these councillors who are loyal to Rajapaksa and not to the SLFP, could be returned to power at local government polls- and that would provide the impetus for Rajapaksas next move.
Local Government polls
The Chief Ministers, obviously keen to test the political waters and bring about a rapprochement between the President and former President, if that was possible at all, sought President Sirisenas permission to meet with Rajapaksa.
Permission was readily granted but President Sirisena did not put any offers on the table. There was no invitation for Rajapaksa to return to the fold- although, technically at least, he still hasnt left it-and there were no deals on offer.
The six Chief Ministers want the former President to abandon plans to field separate lists at Local Government and Provincial Councils polls on the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) ticket as they feel it would hamper the prospects of the SLFP, with the UNP being the ultimate beneficiary.
From Rajapaksas perspective, local government polls are ideally suited for his purpose: it is a local election and not a national poll, so he does not need to run.
He can let his nominees run, cheer them from the sidelines, see how they perform and gauge their- and by extension, his own- popularity, without ever having to leave the SLFP.
Predictably, the talks ended inconclusively. Rajapaksa gave the chief ministers a lecture on the reasons why he couldnt support their cause. He claimed he was being targeted in a political witch hunt and that the SLFP was being betrayed by cohabiting with the UNP in government.
The comments by the two factions after the meeting were interesting. The JO was keen to suggest that the talks were a failure and were unlikely to succeed in the future. On the other hand, the Chief Ministers who attended acknowledged that there were differences of opinion but said discussions would continue. Obviously, both sides are playing to the gallery.
Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna
While some in the SLFP may entertain some anxieties about the outcome of the Local Government elections, the party hierarchy is not so concerned. Whatever the outcome of the local government poll, it does not alter the balance of power in the country. It is also three years away from the next national elections, so it is not likely to give rise to a tidal wave of support for Rajapaksa that could be sustained over a period of several years.
However, what it could do is create an impression that Rajapaksa does command significant support among the masses and give the former President the courage to take the plunge and join the newly created Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP).
For all his political bravado, Rajapaksa has refrained from doing so. He does feel a sense of attachment for the SLFP, the party he nursed for forty five years and led for ten years. He also has concerns as to whether a brand new political party, even with himself at the helm, could take on the established SLFP which is entrenched in the hearts and minds of the average citizen who supports the party.
Rajapaksa will rely on the Local Government elections to provide him with an answer to that question and that explains why he was mostly negative and lukewarm to the suggestions forwarded by the Chief Ministers.
The local polls therefore are a tussle within a tussle  a battle of wits between the Sirisena and Rajapaksa camps of the SLFP, each vying for supremacy and control of the party, while the UNP looks on, not displeased at the shenanigans of its historical rival.

Bill Gates worlds first trillionaire
In our lifetimes, we could see the first trillionaire.And, most likely, that first trillionaire would be Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates.
Thats according to research by Oxfam, an international network of organizations collectively working to alleviate global poverty. Its recently published report finds that eight billionaires from around the globe have as much money as the 3.6 billion people who make up the poorest half of the worlds population .
The report also finds that, given the exponential growth of existing wealth,the world could have its first trillionaire in the next 25 years, when Gates would be 86.
When Gates left Microsoft in 2006, his net worth was $50 billion, according to Oxfam. By 2016, his wealth had increased to $75 billion, despite his commendable attempts to give it away through his Foundation, the report says.
In addition to the charitable work Gates does through his personal foundation, he is one of the founding members of The Giving Pledge, a commitment from some of the richest individuals in the world to give away more than half of their worth. (Yahoo news)

Central Bank bond issue: Parliament to send COPE report to AG
AG to forward report to IGP :
Both sides welcome Speakers proposal:
Parliament yesterday agreed to the Speakers proposal to forward the COPE report on Central Bank Treasury bonds investigation to the Attorney General.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya making a special announcement at the commencement of sittings said the COPE report could be forwarded to the Attorney General if all members of the House agree.
He said eventhough there were hardly any past instances where COPE reports had been forwarded to the AG for further action, doing so would lead to a positive trend. It is my opinion that forwarding any such Committee reports to the AG even in the future will be a good and healthy practice the Speaker said.
The Speaker said the report would be forwarded to the IGP by the Attorney General.
Members of both sides spoke in favour of the proposal of the Speaker. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella thanked the Speaker for initiating what he termed a new tradition in Parliament. Over the past 10-20 years many COPE reports were presented but none was referred to the AG. We requested the then Speaker to send them to the AG, but in vain he said.
The minister also distanced the Government from the petition filed before the Supreme Court challenging the COPE report. Some said the Government had a sinister motive to disrupt the debate by way of this petition. We had no such motive, and neither had we raised that point in the debate yesterday. We have faith in the parliamentary traditions and its control of public finances he said.
COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti while thanking the Speaker also pointed out the need for allowing Parliament and COPE to review the process. MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said it would be better if the Speaker forward the report also to the IGP. He also asked to fix a time frame for the Attorney General to report back to the Speaker.
Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera proposed to establish a separate division in the Attorney Generals Department to work hand in hand with the Committees on Public Accounts.

The champions will lift their game
Just 3 weekends to clock up or follow the chalk marks for that final under lights at the Havies international rugby bowl ..,as Dialog gets their silver ready ...designate the TV detail for the mega rugby night at Havelock Park....
I believe these last 3 crunch weeks will drag us thru a lot more mud and heaps more aches when the injury lists on both sides make difficult reading, and a lot to absorb, given the extreme pressure of a cup final.
The experts, our self appointed rugby pencil stats will finally see some daylight and probably mistake that for a radiant cosmic ballfrom a generous divine fan up on mount Olympus...the herculean possibility, is mighty real and promises to exhaust the fans and players alike.
Havelocks have traditions to dutifully follow and yet another final, another season, another chance of guts and glory to wrap up a dramatic page in SRI rugby.
There is little doubt or the slightest hesitation from any player kit fit to play in the final....or for that matter, patched, ice bathed and massaged to rewire the mind and stand tall ...proper mental and body prep absolutely vital on every level to face-up up to the impressive upcountry lions in combat. Expectations and speculations like drizzling rain ...everybody consciously moved by the passage of play and drama, this season.
Finals are exasperating cauldrons of bubbling aggression, hope, and steel determination ...with no room for pre meditated retaliation or intent to knock any player out - there are written laws and codes, but greater unwritten codes that we stringently follow without question in the middle. The unwritten are inculcated from our first touch of the odd shaped pilland carefully nurtured to maturity and adherence as we graduate the grades from school and club to country.
We learn that respect is fundamental to our existence and the essence of it all.
Today is such a long muggy day in Cinnamon Gardensthe city by the sea and recovery to stand and delivera Thursday print
Lets look at the reality and a few lines on the absolute quality of current rugby in SRI. Internationally we are among the top 5 in Asia at 15s, given our skill levels and ability to match the likes of Japan, Hong Kong and South Korea in the middle. If domestic club rugby is the litmus mark for class and quality the same questions remain unanswered and have done for a decade at least. Basically our larger digits, the boiler house boys ...are several yards short on conditioning, endurance and leg powerespecially in the last quarter. World rugby is dominated by teams that have incredible forwards who power up and decimate defences in the last 20 minutes of the game.,..providing an abundance of good ball for their specialist finishers to open up the encounter...the All Blacks are supreme at this and as world champions, intimidate and cause all manner of trouble to those who lack effective counter and efficient defensive planning.
Domestic rugby is grinding towards its league championship and big hand to Dialog the telecom giant, for its telling partnership with rugby lets hope their support and good thinking will shape our future ,,with obvious consideration for both the mens and womens 7s over the next two Asian season. Currently the men are 4th in Asia, and should have been 2nd or 3rd ...the women 7th and should have been 4th considerations by the parent body to establish a professional player friendly eco bloodline to nourish and nurture these young guns who did their country proud ...winning the U19 and U18 Asian 7s cups in 2016.
They must certainly be the focus and investment for our skills future...giving them total support to grow in a performance friendly secure environment .that encourages intense preparation and effective mapping.
Will domestic rugby benefit from opening our island doors to expat players as we did with the 7s ...or stick to our stubborn home players only policy. IRB sanction for Hong Kong and Japan give them the luxury of choice and a compelling quality of player to challenge the best in world rugby.Japan beat South Africa in the world cup and at the Olympics 7s - ran past the All Blacks to make the quarters.
I am a firm believer in leading by example and sharing insight, experience, knowledge and strength its valuable!
Finally lets throw some light and ask a few questions domestically - where is Jason Dassanayake why is he not playing
Will Danushka 'trytime' Ranjan (current 13 tries) score 20 or more tries in the league Will Dulaj 'boots' Perera slot 200 points by the last game in the league (current 152 points) Who will win the Dialog league cup Havelocks or Kandy keep in mind, the game is at Havelocks under lights ...enjoy the speculation and forecasts either on pure risk or sheer professional guesswork After all, it is a 50-50 shot at the title a two horse race and just 80minutes regulation time plus time added on if scores are level.
A delightful and enthralling fact about the result which means so much to all those whose lives are dedicated to quality and perfect finishing in the middle its attention to detail and each of the team doing their job to their max, giving the coach plenty of options and some calm during the final ..knowing...under pressure his team are mentally tougher, fitter and able to absorb the forward power and still shape that Big Big W for his future..
Wishes to RJ for determination and focus despite the obstaclespersistence and attitude certainly the point of difference.
Both coaches will need plenty of calm and mental prep to sit through the next 4 weeks ...Ronny Ibrahim at Havies and Sean Wijesinghe the Kandy coach...both men are proud Kandyans ..true graduates of the game ...and embrace contrasting styles that are chalk and cheese.
The key for me is fitness, hunger to win, pride, and injuries to key players... come the final on 5 February at Havelock Park for a 6.30pm floodlit epic.
Top form to think we get to see the best warriors in Sri rugby platform their skills for us fans and those experts to crow and scream in admiration...players needs their supporters and the knowledge that their skills and courage are much appreciated, admired beyond the ocean.
Finals are the ultimate statement, a chance to make history and shine for the island to celebrate...its that time to translate all the months of graft and sweat into smooth outrageous skills the captivate the fans and stun the opposition..bula bula those with the magic and hit the charm on that day in the middle...its all on the day.
All told we are a small part our island nations glorious rugby history and can be proud of its future too. Cheers islanders.

Citizens Mail
Request for transparency of new constitution
As a citizen of Sri Lanka, I sincerely feel that the draft of new constitution must be exposed to public transparency in order to confirm the guarantee of the rights and concessions to the majority and minority communities.
The main objectives of the new constitution must be the legal safeguards to the minorities in using their mother tongue as the medium of education and communication in the country without any discrimination. In the mean time, the children of the minority communities must be provided with all the facilities in education from primary level to university level just as the children of the majority community are provided by the state.
The new constitution should guarantee the use of the language of the minorities in official correspondence without thrusting Sinhala only in dealing with them.
It is disheartening to note that in spite of Government language policy, all official letters are sent in Sinhala only. It is unfair to the users of Tamil language as their mother tongue. Hence new constitution should reform the public administrative system with official correspondence in three languages - Sinhala, Tamil and English.
Thus, the new constitution should guarantee the free practice of any religion without the interference of others who may try to control other religions and cultures with communal feelings. Such acts of prejudice must be punishable according to new constitution. Thus the comprehensive new constitution must submit a draft to each religious and linguistic body for perusal before it is implemented as a constitutional law.
Every educated intellectual must be given an opportunity of studying the draft before it is unanimously accepted by the deserving section of the citizens.

Contemporary Management Techniques for Local Film Industry
The famous film director, producer Stephen Spielberg once described Sri Lanka as a hidden treasure and a paradise isle consisting of varied climatic conditions, greenery, breathtaking beaches, waterfalls, mountains and plantations.
He was also convinced that Sri Lanka could be tagged as an ideal film location at a relatively lower cost. The international film producers, directors selected Sri Lanka as their film production location for films like Mother Theresa, Water and Bombay Velvet ahead of other countries.
In much earlier times, Bridge over river Kwai, Indiana Jones and the temple of doom, Jungle book, Sooryawansham, Pilot Premnath and more films were produced here on exotic locations.
Talking about Bridge over River Kwai, the film was based on a story in world war 2and was an academy award winning film. The great film director David Lean selected the location of Kitulgala close to Avissawella in Sri Lanka.
The film also shows Mount Lavinia Hotel which was a hospital to treat injured British soldiers in Sri Lanka during the war times. Those films also had leading actors/actresses in the likes of William Holden(Bridge over river Kwai), Amitabh Bachchan (Sooryawansham),Harrison Ford (Indiana jones), Sivaji Ganeshan(Pilot Premnath),Ranbir Kapoor, the grand son of Raj Kapoor (Bombay Velvet) and other Indian idols like Rajendra Kumar, Amrish Puri, Gulshan Grover to name a few.
Bombay Velvet was shot in Ranminitenna, Colombo, Galle and also in Passikudah which also starred the present Bollywood actress Anoushka Sharma.
The film locations in Sri Lanka have still not been fully tapped by the international film production companies. We have breathtaking mountains, sandy beaches, caves, green paddy fields, forests, colonial and modern hotels, ancient buildings and railway stations, religious places of worship, wild life and bird parks, gardens, domestic international airports, universities educational establishments, horse racing and golf tracks, sports grounds, shopping malls and almost all types of other locations to suit the needs of any film production company in the world.
Our own local film production companies need be given incentives to attract foreign based production teams for film production in Sri Lanka.
Development of studios
International film production could be turned into a top foreign currency earning avenue for Sri Lanka tourism if handled efficiently. We have more film production studios other than Ranminitenna. Development of those studios with latest equipment and facilities will lure great demand for international film shooting units as we have more outdoor locations as well. Our own actors actresses, film production companies, music directors, sound recordists, cameramen, makeup artistes and even our directors will find gainful employment and earning avenues with international film production companies coming to Sri Lanka for film production. Many Sri Lankan artistes found opportunities to act in foreign films, namely, Iranganie Serasinghe, Malini Fonseka, D.R. Nanayakkara, Denawaka Hamine and many others. Our film, directors and artistes have won many awards in the recent past at international film festivals held at prestigious locations.
Our own Jaqueline Fernandez took the Bollywood by storm with her stunning appearances. We have plenty of film artistes who are fluent in English and in other languages. Our film artistes who have returned from their long stays abroad can contribute to the cause of attracting overseas film directors and production companies or could enter into joint venture productions with them. International actors of Sri Lankan origin include Albert Moses who played the role of Ranjeet in the Mind your language series in UK, M.G. Ramachandran, A.E. Manoharan and Alston Koch comes to my mind. Jaqueline Fernandez is a cut above the rest and is a mega Bollywood star.
Pooja Umashankar from South India has now secured a permanent place in the Sri Lanka cinema.
A film could be easily shot in Sri Lanka in its entirety making use of all facilities available within a period of 30 to 45 days if any producer/director wishes. Our latest film production studio Ranminitenna located in Hambantota possess all facilities to make different sets for different scenes. Film production is an area which the tourism authorities could tap to bring in high net worth spenders to the country as international film budgets are quite high and the producers can save substantial funds by shooting the film in Sri Lanka.
This will be a win situation for both Sri Lanka and the film producer. Major Western film producing groups include 20th century fox, paramount pictures, united artistes, Columbia pictures, Metro Goldwyn Meyer, Golden Harvest, Sony pictures Entertainment and a number of other new comers. Great North Indian producer groups families include Sippy, Nadiadwala, KaranJohar, Bonny Kapoor, the Roshan family, Dhawans, Amir Khan productions, R.K. Films and a host of others. I strongly believe that direct approaches to above named would bring in fruitful results. We must send out the message to the world film production companies that Sri Lanka is a top film shooting location in the world. In addition to Ranminitenna two other film production villages could be set up in two other locations, ideally in the hill country and a destination closer to Colombo like Avissawella or Negombo on a joint venture basis with a foreign film production company.
In the sixtees many North Indian film stars visited Sri Lanka for premiere show of many Hindi films in which they acted. Some of them include Dev Anand and Nutan . Nutans sister and a top actress in the sixties and seventies Tanuja even acted in a Sinhala film. Tanuja is the mother of top Bollywood actress Kajol. The IIFFA event, the pinnacle festival of North Indian cinema was held in 2010 in Colombo drawing many Bollywood artistes both young and old into our country. This event created the gate opening for many Hindi films to be shot in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka artistes won many international awards very specially in the last decade at international film festivals held. All these award winning actors, actresses, directors and others entered the hall of fame of Sri Lankan cinema by bagging international awards.
The pioneers of Sri Lankan film production include Lester James Pieris, Sumithra Pieris, K. Gunaratnam of cinemas fame, Robin Tampoe, K.A.W. Perera, E.A.P. Edirisinghe,Titus Thotawatte and Herbert M. Seneviratne. At the maturity stage value addition was done by Chandran Ratnam, Soma Edirisinghe, Milina Sumathipala, Sunil Ariyaratne, Robin Fernando, Asoka Perera, Prasanna Vithanage, Somaratne Dissanayake and a host of others. Sri Lanka now boast of an advanced film industry which could match any international production. Chandran Ratnams contribution in bringing foreign production units to Sri Lanka during the last three decades is commendable. Our film industry is in need of more private and state sector assistance. Our corporate conglomerates should venture out into local and international film production which would pay rich dividends in time to come.
Types of films range from Adventure, religious, historical, war, sciencefiction, comedy, horror, country and western, action and so on. The sky is the limit for the film industry. However, the story and cast are of paramount importance. The state film corporation is required to assist all producers and directors who produced award winning films for Sri Lanka at international festivals. In this respect it is prudent to appoint a few corporate sector magnates to the director board of state film corporation. At least one film hall in every major city of this country be brought to international standards. Even foreigners will come and watch local movies for relaxation, provided the films have English subtitles. Cinema owners could provide a separate box for foreigners at least in major screening halls at a higher price may be at 10 us dollars so that they need not mix with locals.
Entertainment taxes
The travel agents and hoteliers could prepare their itineraries to enable visitors to watch a local film at comfort in between tired journeys. All entertainment taxes should be reduced for film exhibitors to enable them to earn higher profits.
The film corporation should have regular monthly meetings with local film producers and directors for reaching mutual agreements on dates of screening, government taxes, incentives and facilities required, welfare of all film artistes and the proposals of film producers conducive to the advancement of our film industry. The pricing of tickets for the public is another matter for discussion as ticket prices have soared over the years depriving the common man to see a film at a cinema hall like the good old days to at least stay away from their day to day troubles at least for a few hours. There is another school of thought that the outstanding teledramas of the eighties should be turned into films. Good examples are teledramas like Palingu Menike, Yashorawaya, Baladevagelokaya, Tharadevi, Meniknadiya Gala Basi, Ellalangawalauwa and many others. These teledramas have powerful stories and true to life situations. I am sure once converted into films these teledrama will hit the international platform in no time.
For the benefit of all film producers, directors and others who wish to produce films, given below is a list of pre requisites for making a successful film both in terms of revenue earning capacity and popularity.
1. The story of the film

3. Film locations

29. Compliance with environmentallaws local by-laws at film locations
30. Efficient editing of the film
The above are only some criteria for a successful film. The acceptance and public rating of the film depends on a number of other factors such as social norms, film exhibition cinema halls and their quality and the variety fare offered. Disputes with film artistes and crew be avoided at all times as they form the nucleus of the film. Film script should be read by all artistes, production crew and others prior to signing of contracts and engaging them.
The film artistes and production units may require amendments to the script, scenes and locations to suit their performance. These amendments should be discussed with them in order to avoid misunderstandings and also to augment performance enhancement. Inter personal and inter group disputes be settled amicably with the view of early and successful completion of the film and also to save costs. Repeat shooting of scenes be avoided at all times as this will be a time consuming and costly exercise. Insurance cover to all artistes, film crew, equipment, vehicles, studios and other items is also important to minimize losses on mishaps during shooting, travelling and lodging at different places. External support staff should be carefully selected after auditions for individual scenes.
The returns from the contemporary film industry is quite high when compared to that of decades ago. Unlike a trading or manufacturing venture, experienced directors and producers know how to handle their films and procure above average returns. The Hollywood, Bollywood and Kollywood films are usually mega productions. The main actors and actresses are paid lavishly. They have a trying task of saving their taxes. They continually engage in sourcing investments which would offer them handsome returns. For example take the case of IPL franchises .Two main teams, namely, Kolkata Knightriders and Kings xi Punjab are controlled by actor Sharukh Khan and Preity Zinta respectively. They physically visit match venues and cheer for their teams. They now have the option of continuing with the franchise or selling them at a lucrative profit as it is extremely difficult to field a new team as most prominent states of India are in the competition. Along with above normal profits film producers in India face threats from extortionists or the so called Gundahs for protection money for which some producers secretly oblige while others ignore them and beef up their security. The film artistes especially the main actors and actresses are well aware that they can earn lavishly for a few years only as the film industry sources out a large number of film artistes for a year.
Some achieve the celebrity status from their first film itself while others will have to wait and bank on a good film. Local awards will be the first target for any film artiste before venturing out into international awards. Indian movie Slumdog Millionaire bagged a number of international awards rating highly in the overseas film circuit. Another Indian movie Krrish was requested by a number of American universities due to the story being associated with a human acquiring super powers through an alien.
International Awards
Some film idols enter the political scene once they quit acting while some others stars contest elections while they are still in the limelight. Good examples from Sri Lanka are Gamini Fonseka, Malini Fonseka, Niel Rupasinghe, Geetha Kumarasinghe and Ranjan Ramanayake. Due to their screen popularity they obtain votes of all sections of public, namely, youth, middle aged and elderly voters. When we look at India the following names comes to our mind. They are M.G. Ramachandran, Jayalalitha, Dharmendra, Sunil Dutt, Shatrughan Sinha, Vyjayanthimala and many others. From the Hollywood we find Ronald Reagan, Clint Eastwood and Arnold Schwarzenegger at the top. Even the present President Donald Trump has appeared in a few guest roles for a couple of films. It is the popularity of the artiste and their personality that would lead them to politics.
Talking about the film industry itself, the US film industry is over 120 years old while the Indian film industry is 103 years old. India is the largest producer of films in the world for a calendar year. Nigeria comes second and they resort to produce films in neighbouring African countries conducive for film production mainly for cost control and also for security reasons.
Collections wise the largest box office countries are USA, China, U.K., South Korea and India. The worldwide theatrical market has a box office of nearly us$ 40 billion for a year. Some producers receive various incentives and support to augment the revenue from films. For e ample, the recent release of Kabali starring famous actor Rajni Kanth received enhanced promotion through the corporate sector when some establishments permitted their staff to watch the film on the first day itself in Chennai and Bangalore. Some even declared a holiday on the day of release of the film. Unfortunately, in Sri Lanka our film releases are not supported by the state and private sector in any worthwhile assistance to boost the production of quality films in Sri Lanka.
State Film Corporation should include a couple of directors and the chairman from the blue chip private sector companies rather than the political appointees at all times since this is an industry where Sri Lanka receives global attention, promotion and recognition through high quality films with powerful stories and dynamic cast. I am sure these corporate sector directors will render voluntary services for the promotion of film industry in Sri Lanka.
Lastly, I wish to add that film production should not be aimed at hurting the feelings of followers of any religion or any section of the community. It is good to see Sri Lanka still following the restrictions on tobacco and alcohol. The film censoring board should consist of veterans in the industry and a few senior citizens of the society to maintain our religious, cultural and social norms. What we expect from a film is entertainment to take away the day to day blues of our people and not to instill fear, shame, humiliation and frustration which would further aggravate their daily life pattern.

Ex Sampath Bankers Club completes first CSR Project
Ex Sampath Bankers club completed its first CSR project when it set up a Childrens Library at a school which lacked many facilities as the children were all from very poor families in the area.
The Executive Council of the Club in keeping with its objectives took a decision to embark on a CSR project and selected education sector to be the focus. The members of the Committee appointed visited some schools in the Colombo district and although most of them requested assistance the facilities they already enjoyed were such that they could not be categorised as most deserving. Therefore the committee decided to look at schools in the Kalutara district with the assistance of the Regional Manager of Sampath Bank responsible for that district and the Manager of their Kalutara Branch.
The Manager discussed this issue some officials in the Regional Education Department in Kalutara and obtained their recommendation to decide on a deserving school. The school selected for the project was Duwegoda Primary School which is located in Halkadawala a remote area in the Kalutara District which lacked many facilities but having a highly motivated Principal and staff who took great pains towards developing the school.
Sampath Bank very generously provided the thirty nine school bags along with tills for this purpose and they were presented to the new students at this ceremony. The school principal, teachers and the parents in their speeches expressed their appreciation of the contribution made by the Club to fulfill a long felt need of this poor remote school.
Ex Sampath Bankers Club very sincerely thank all those who contributed towards this worthy cause and looks forward to their continued support for its future projects as well.

The time has come to fortify the partys (SLFPs) preparations without delay, she said.
Many discussions take place taking into account the importance of the partys interests. There have been disagreements and criticism, she said.

Beef takes centre stage at The Grill, and only the choicest cuts of premium American Angus beef are chosen. Renowned for its superior quality and tender texture, American Angus beef is the preferred choice amongst many gourmet steak houses around the world. Filet Steak, Surf and Turf, and the perfectly aged New York Strip are definite a must try especially for the discerning steak connoisseur.

Alwaleed Philanthropies has come forward to support Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka's initiative by providing funding to construct 80 houses for victims of the landslides. Alwaleed Philanthropies has supported Habitat for Humanity's work over the past years including the earthquakes in Ecuador, Japan and Nepal and a cyclone in Vanuatu.
A Memorandum of Understanding between HFHSL and the Government of Sri Lanka's agents in Aranayake and Yatiyantota was signed on December 19, 2016 at the Kegalle District Secretariat. Through the Kegalle Housing Project, Habitat for Humanity Sri Lanka has pledged to construct 40 houses for the victims of landslides in Kalugala, Aranayake, 23 houses in Illukthenna Estate, Deraniyagala followed by the construction of 17 houses in Yatiyantota.

## Title: India-China rivalry reaches into orbit and beyond

India-China rivalry reaches into orbit and beyond

A new space race is underway in Asia, with China and India dueling for dominance while other countries make leaps of their own. National pride and defense are major motivators, but so are practical considerations -- generating income from satellite launches, mitigating natural disasters and monitoring crops. By establishing a presence in Earth's orbit, and perhaps the expanse beyond it, governments and companies aim to ensure prosperity on the ground.
After India's decision in November to scrap its largest bank notes, the picture on the back of the new 2,000-rupee replacement bill was surely the last thing on the minds of cash-strapped citizens. The image, though, highlights a major national achievement and emphasizes the country's highest aspiration: to secure its place among the stars.
The note features a picture of India's Mangalyaan probe, Asia's first successful Mars orbiter. Launched in November 2013, the craft traveled around 670 million km and began circling the red planet the following September. Prime Minister Narendra Modi lauded the mission in a televised address. "History has been created," he said. "We have dared to reach out into the unknown and have achieved the near impossible."
Of course, India is hardly alone up there. Regional rival China in 2003 became only the third nation in history to achieve manned spaceflight, after the former Soviet Union and the U.S. Just as the 20th-century space race pitted those Cold War enemies against each other, a 21st-century race is picking up in Asia, with New Delhi and Beijing doing some serious jockeying.
The broad goals of enhancing national defense and gaining international prestige remain powerful motivators for reaching skyward. But Asian countries also have specific, diverse and practical ambitions: to develop their own high-speed communications infrastructure, to explore for natural resources, to mitigate natural disasters and to snag satellite launch contracts from other nations.
In December, Indians saw just how valuable their space program can be. As Cyclone Vardah bore down on the southern state of Tamil Nadu, the India Meteorological Department used data from the country's weather satellites to project the storm's path. This prompted the evacuation of more than 10,000 people, saving untold lives.
Not a few Indians take advantage of the country's satellites every time they turn on the TV. Tata Sky, a direct-to-home satellite TV company launched in 2006 by Tata Group and 21st Century Fox, is capitalizing on entertainment demand among the growing middle class, providing more than 400 channels. It has a contract with the Indian Space Research Organization (ISRO) to use INSAT-4A, a national satellite system; it began 4K telecasts in January 2015.
We have liftoff
India's first satellite launch with its own rocket came in 1979. It has since sent up 142 satellites aboard 59 rockets, including launches commissioned by other countries and unsuccessful attempts. The pace has picked up in recent years, with 75 satellites launched on 24 missions since 2012.
The business of launching satellites for other countries is flourishing. The ISRO has so far handled 79 satellites for 21 nations, including the U.S., Japan, Canada, Algeria and Indonesia.
In any case, the program hit a turning point in December 2014, when India fired off a prototype of the Geosynchronous Satellite Launch Vehicle Mark III -- a large, advanced rocket that can carry a payload of 8 tons into low Earth orbit and 4 tons into a high-altitude geostationary transfer orbit. The maximum payload is 60% greater than that for the GSLV-MK-II, previously India's largest rocket in service.
Demand for communications, broadcasting, weather and Earth resources satellites is rapidly growing in emerging countries, where millions are signing up for cellphones and disaster preparedness is an ever-present challenge. "Many countries, like South Korea and Saudi Arabia, are trying to launch their own satellites," noted Y.S. Rajan, honorary distinguished professor at the ISRO. "With the GSLV-MK-III, India will be able to meet the requirements."
Recent missions have shown the world what India can do. Last June, it launched 20 satellites in one go -- a national record. In September, it pulled off the feat of launching eight satellites into two different orbits. The ISRO is now preparing to launch 82 satellites in one mission. That would be a world record.
Low-cost launches are India's forte. The mission to Mars made this clear: Launching the Mangalyaan cost $74 million, about one-ninth the cost of the Maven, an American Mars probe. The difference was thanks to domestic production, downsizing of parts and the decision to limit the equipment and functionality.
The Mangalyaan project also shows India harbors ambitions far beyond simply putting satellites in orbit. It plans to follow up by launching a Mangalyaan-2 Mars probe in 2018.
Manned space missions are another possibility. The launch of the Mark III prototype in December 2014 carried an unmanned crew module, which re-entered the atmosphere and splashed down in the Bay of Bengal, as designed. Another leap came last May, when India launched and recovered its Reusable Launch Vehicle -- a craft that resembles the Space Shuttle.
With the backing of Modi and other officials, the organization's budget has been increasing steadily. And engineers who once might have sought jobs in information technology are turning their gaze to the heavens. Some influential voices, however, question the wisdom of chasing national prestige. "People prefer having rice to eat," Rajan said. "A space program involves an enormous cost."
Last year, ISRO Chairman A.S. Kiran Kumar said a manned mission "is not a priority at all."
"Our priority," Kumar stressed, "is to build capacity for new [satellite] launches."
Rather than trying to compete in manned spaceflight -- a field in which China has a head start -- it may be more realistic for India to focus on higher-performance satellites and probes. Either way, the country's space program bears watching.

Kandy Sports Club was able to win the game due to a fine performance in the first half through the clever thinking of fly half Fazil Marija. At half-time the winners led 31-8 and it looked like as if though Kandy would step up a gear and switch on the same style of play which they are famous for in the second half. However in this game they were able to score only a penalty in the second half and in the alternate Police SC scored 15 points to make the final score 34-23.
Thanks to some heroic performances by the Cops on their home ground a fine brand of rugby was dished out. Police looked like a revamped outfit after their narrow loss to Air Force SC which would have caused some chaos in their ranks. Anyway the winners from the hills know how to hold their heads high in a game of rugby when the going is tough. Referee Irshad Cader enjoyed a good game by being on the spot where the action was right from the first whistle. It was one of the best game's he had blown this season.
Police scored in the third minute of the game and in the last third minute. It was sad to see only a handful of committee members from both clubs present at this game but the rugby fans were there as usual. Roshan Weeraratne the skipper had to stay out of this game due injury. This also was a big loss as he reads the game well and makes the necessary changes when needed. Sad to say in this game Kandy were losing their player discipline- offloading in dangerous positions when they don't need to and committing silly mistakes. The second half was very scrappy and disappointing. There was no consistency in their play which led to mistakes where Police took advantage to get back to the game, and Kandy also made replacements when it was not needed. Police played together as a team thanks to their coach Sudath Sampath, the former Police SC, Kandy SC and Sri Lanka scrum half. Kandy usually work wide to use the on-fire Richard Dharmapala who has been sensational this season but was struggling in the second half. Thilina Wijesinghe has been the unsung hero for the hill capital and was judged the Man of the Match at this game.

Lak Sathosa, private millers to convert 90,000 tons of paddy into rice
The Cabinet yesterday revealed that the Rural Economic Affairs Ministry has ordered that 90,958 metric tons of paddy owned by the Paddy Marketing Board at district level be handed over to private paddy mill owners and Lanka Sathosa to be converted to rice.
While Lanka Sathosa has already processed the paddy and is selling it at Rs.76 per kilogram, many of the private mill owners have not made the paddy available on the market.
A Cabinet Sub Committee has been appointed to oversee the issuing of rice stocks and to take action against mill owners who have not issued their stocks to the market. The Cabinet of Ministers stated that the Indonesian government will donate 10,000 metric tons of rice that should be in the country soon. It also noted the need of importing rice from countries such as Indonesia and Vietnam unless rice is made cheaper.

Lanka shows no improvement in Corruption Perception Index
Sri Lankas position in the Corruption Perception Index has not improved as per the 2016 data.
The Corruption Perception Index (CPI) ranks countries according to the perceived level of public sector corruption where Sri Lanka is ranked 95th out of 176 counties with a poor score of 36, Electoral Integrity Project Manager of Transparency International Sri Lanka Sashee de Mel said.
Addressing a press briefing at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute in Colombo yesterday she said that the ranks are based on a scoring system that ranges between 0 (public sector perceived as highly corrupt) to 100 (public sector perceived as very clean).
The Corruption Perceptions Index aggregates data from a number of different sources that provide perceptions of business people and country experts of the level of corruption in the public sector. The CPI 2016 is calculated using 13 different data sources from 12 different institutions that capture perceptions of corruption within the past two years, she said.
Globally, the data reveals that a staggering 69 percent of the 176 countries scored below 50 in the 2016 CPI indicating the high levels of perceived public sector corruption prevalent throughout the world. 2016 also marks an alarming trend where more countries had declined rather than improve in the overall index. Denmark and New Zealand are jointly ranked 1st in the 2016 CPI with a score of 90 followed by Finland, Sweden and Switzerland ranked 3rd, 4th and 5th respectively. India has scored highest in the South Asian region with a score of 40 and ranked 79th overall. India is followed by Sri Lanka and the Maldives which are jointly ranked 95th, she added.

In line with lines
Architecture is about bringing the spirit into space. It can help you reduce stress with the skill of the architect. Arch World meets up with architect Shobha Senaviratna who shared with us how she creates this magic.
Stress can occur for many reasons. Maybe too much of work. When you come back home after work, the home has to be peaceful where you can release stress. Your home has to be a relaxing place to calm your mind. After identifying the clients requirements and lifestyle, planning the orientation of the building is the most important thing. This is again the positive energy which I touched on in the previous article, said Senaviratna.
If you orient the building in the proper manner, you will get more sunlight and cross ventilation.
You can bring the spirit into space. You get a lot of energy. When you enter a space, you must feel relaxed. When space is cluttered, you need to get out of the place. Sometimes when you have a house that is too big, cleaning will be a problem. That causes more stress. When arranging spaces, there has to be a certain order. The finish matters a lot. It has to be user friendly. Colours can do a lot, stated Senaviratna.
A house can be a brand new one designed by an architect or it can be a refurbished one. Some houses could be on rent. Maybe it is a built house and needs some renovation. If it is a brand new design, it is easier for an architect. If it is an existing one, they have more work.
If spaces are tiny, you have to go with soothing colours. When you enter, you have to feel the space. Sometimes you may apply black colour for the ceiling. You need to have a knowledge of colours. When you apply black, you feel the ceiling is very low.
If the ceiling is low, you would feel very stuffy. Especially if you are a six footer you will feel the space is not enough. We choose a light colour, cool colour and white colour. The ceiling is still the same level but you feel it is at a higher level. These are the tricks, explained Senaviratna.
Architecture can release stress. Orientation and planning is important. Spaces have to be simple. The inside - outside connectivity is important. When you connect with the outside, we feel the boundary wall. We feel free. That is the capability of designers.
Architecture is a combination of art and science. Art is all about music, dancing and painting. When it comes to art, you can enjoy it visually. But when it comes to architecture, it is combination of art and science because you have to construct it. As architects, we have to learn both, pointed out Senaviratna.
Lines also matter. We define spaces out of lines.
Lets say your living space has zig- zag lines or your furniture is zig- zag shaped. If you have a zig- zag shaped furniture piece, you dont feel comfortable. Because it is a harsh edge. When you get a series of harsh edges, you are not comfortable. It is a little scary because it is a harsh edge. When you have natural rhythms, curvy or simple, straight forward, vertical and horizontal, then it is friendlier and the movements are easy. For example, if a reception desk is curvy, more people can move. You have to apply these things in planning because then the stress will be less. Your mind is peaceful with enough light and ventilation, the movements are happening nicely. Due to colours, textures and proportions, it is harmonious, elucidated Senaviratna.
There are many other considerations  according to the average humans, there is a certain height of the chair because you have different chairs  you have a sofa and normal chairs. Likewise even the staircase, there is the minimum height and width of the step. If not we are not comfortable. Everything has to be applied, added Senaviratna.
With regard to architecture, most people think that it is a few lines together and spaces but there is much more. It is not only a building.
Sri Lanka is a tropical country. We have to know how we are going to take sunlight into interior spaces and how to take the wind in. If we design accordingly we dont need air conditioning or a fan even in an urban context. Architecture is a wonderful thing. Architecture can contribute to mental health and it can make your mind clear. Just think if you are living in a hot stuffy dark room, then you will feel drowsy and you wont be comfortable in that place, informed Senaviratna.
Senaviratna also shared with the Daily News some of her perspectives on the history of architecture in Sri Lanka.
When you take our particular architectural language, ancient Sri Lankan architecture is dominated by caves and temples. If you take the ancient Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa era, it is dominated by dagabas, stupas and temples. But when the Portuguese, Dutch and British came to Sri Lanka, they tried to adapt their styles with Sri Lankan tropics, said Senaviratna.
She pointed out that considering Town Hall and the Old Parliament buildings they have that character. Even the Queens Hotel in Kandy, it is not the Kandyan architecture, it is the Colonial architecture!
Colonial architecture introduced a lot of things such as gothic columns and European columns and also the panel doors like what you have at Barefoot Gallery. You can still see those colonial elements in modern day Sri Lanka with even the verandahs and roofs and the bungalows, stated Senaviratna.
Post Independence, we were influenced by our ancient architectural and colonial architectural styles.
With regard to ancient architecture, houses and dwellings were mostly vernacular architecture. They used eco- friendly materials and built simple houses. Then in the third century, in Anuradhapura and Pollonnaruwa, they had nine story buildings as well. We are inspired by architectural styles of India as well. Then the Colonial rulers came. So new materials came in and got changed, pointed out Senaviratna.
In tropical climates you get more sun and wind, and the rain beats. So colonials introduced high pitched sloping roofs and long eaves  the extension of the roof towards the Verandah. Protecting the doors, windows and walls as well. Because of Sri Lankan climate conditions, people want to extend to the outdoors, so they have big verandahs as we have no winter.
In ancient houses, when examining the courtyard concept, it is more than just getting in sunlight and ventilation, it has a practical aspect as well. There is a habit, the mother or the lady of the house works while the children play in the inner courtyard, inside the premises of the house. So security is guaranteed, with the children playing inside the house. So she can work peacefully, pointed out Senaviratna.
So in the olden days people were very careful and nature friendly. We waste so many things. But they were very thoughtful. They harvested water.
Most activities happen in the inner central courtyard. It is not small it is huge. Sometimes they even had a well in the courtyard. They even had a very good water harvesting system. They connect the gutters and they collect it into a tank. That is how they harvested water, clarified Senaviratna. Our particular architectural language is a combination of all of this with the present day modernism.
In order to facilitate fusion you should know the history, the traditional and the modern. Fusion is not an easy thing. So you should know your business. If you take a country  its culture, the behavior of the people, history, identity, is represented from the buildings.
When it comes to Colombo it is hard to get an identity. The old parliament is of the colonial period. Then you get all the hotels representing the modern.
Then there is Bambalapitiya and then when it comes to Wellawatte there is a different identity - the buildings, culture, music, fashion and even the aroma. In Bambalapitiya it is a mixed community. But when you are in Bambalapitiya, with the recent development, sometimes you feel like you are in Singapore or sometimes you feel like you are in Malaysia.
For example in London when you are in Alperton, you dont feel you are in London. People are speaking in Hindu and Tamil. They all speak in their language not in English, shared Senaviratna.

Madras court directs Ministry to secure 120 fishing boats from SL govt.
The Madurai Bench of the Madras High Court on Tuesday directed Indias Secretary to the Union Ministry of External Affairs to take appropriate steps within two months to salvage the 120 fishing boats of Tamil fishermen from the Sri Lankan government.
Advocate Thirumurugan from Morepannai fishing village, Ramathapuram district had filed a petition before a divisional bench comprising Justices A. Selvam and P.Kalaiyarasan stating that the livelihood of the fishermen has been affected after the
Sri Lankan Navy seized 120 fishing boats including 80 boats belonging to fishermen of Rameswaram island recently.
The advocate said that prolonged berthing without proper upkeep of the 120 boats would cause permanent damage to their structure. The Tamil Nadu government had also written to the Secretary, Ministry of External Affairs, New Delhi to take appropriate steps to release the boats, but only in vain. Countering this, the Central government pleader told the court that the Ministry has been taking up the issue.- Deccan Chronicle

Mastercard presented with World Food Programme's 2017 Hunger Hero Award
The United Nations World Food Programme (WFP) honored Mastercard with the prestigious Hunger Hero award at its annual dinner at the World Economic Forum in Davos.
Mastercard CEO Ajay Banga accepted the award on behalf of the company, which was recognized for its contributions towards achieving a Zero Hunger world.
Over the past five years Mastercard and WFP have been working together towards a single mission: to end hunger.
Believing that technology has the power to unlock innovation in food assistance delivery, the partnership has worked to bring new ideas to WFP programs and raise important funds.
One of the most significant initiatives of the partnership is the use of technology in response to the refugee crisis in Syria.
Under a global partnership, Mastercard provided technical expertise that has enabled WFP to bring electronic payments to 2.2 million Syrian refugees in Lebanon and Jordan who have been able to access food locally through Mastercard branded prepaid cards.
The prepaid cards can be redeemed against a list of items at participating local stores, allowing refugees to buy the food that fits their needs, including fresh produce, which is often scarce. The money is automatically wired to the cards, so refugees don't have to wait in line to receive their entitlements.
In addition to leveraging its technology, Mastercard enabled employees around the world to undertake temporary assignments at WFP offices to take a hands on approach to the partnership.
With the creation of a donation platform that integrates charitable giving into everyday life, Mastercard and its bank and retail partners have helped raise funds to provide over 17 million school meals to vulnerable children around the world.

Melania Trump is adhering to a promise of her husband, President Trump, to keep America first.
Her entire inauguration wardrobe was designed and made in the United States.
Fashion critics, like Vanessa Friedman of the New York Times, praising Mrs. Trumps America first wardrobe for her decision to wear only American designers during inauguration weekend. Like Ralph Lauren -- who created a pale blue ensemble for her to wear during Fridays historic events.
The list of designers tasked with dressing the new first lady is as diverse as they are talented.
New York designer Norisol Ferrari, whose family is of Colombian and Venezuelan descent created a military style jacket for Mrs. Trump to wear during the wreath laying ceremony at Arlington cemetery Thursday.
Later that evening, she was donning a shimmery gold gown for dinner at union station by Lebanese-born, New York designer Reem Acra.
For the big finale, a chic white ball gown had everyone talking. The designer responsible, French-born Herve Pierre, who moved to the U.S. in the early 90s , previously serving as creative director of Carolina Herrera, worked with the first lady to create the stunning gown.
Pierre told ABC News exclusively that it was an honour to dress the first lady of my new country! and that collaborating with Mrs. Trump - who he describes as so kind, was organic and easy because she knows about construction. She was very specific about the lines of the dress. It was an extraordinary project.

Mexico: We will not pay for Trump border wall

Mexico will not pay for Donald Trump's border wall, the country's president has said in a message to the nation.
Enrique Pena Nieto said he lamented the plans for the barrier, adding that Mexico doesn't believe in walls.
But he made no mention of cancelling or postponing a trip to Washington on 31 January to meet the new US president.
Trump has signed an executive order for an impassable physical barrier and has insisted Mexico will reimburse the US for it.
Pena Nieto told the nation in a televised address: I've said time and again; Mexico won't pay for any wall.
I regret and condemn the decision of the United States to continue construction of a wall that, for years, has divided us instead of uniting us. Instead, Pena Nieto said his country offered its friendship to the American people and its willingness to reach accords with their government.
Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray - in Washington to lead a delegation that has held talks at the White House - told the Televisa network the president was still weighing next Tuesday's visit but said the meeting stands for now.
Pena Nieto met Trump - then a presidential candidate - in Mexico City in September and came under intense criticism at home and his current approval ratings are low.
Trump said in an interview with ABC News that Mexico would absolutely, 100% reimburse the US for his wall.
But Congress would have to approve funding for the structure, which is estimated to cost billions of dollars.
Building a 2,000 mile (3,200km) barrier along the Mexican border was one of Trump's key pledges in the election campaign.
He spoke of a crisis on the southern US border as he signed the directives during a ceremony at the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday.
The orders also called for hiring 10,000 immigration officials to help boost border patrol efforts.
A nation without borders is not a nation, he said. Beginning today the United States gets back control of its borders.
The executive orders are among a flurry expected on national and border security this week.

Moeen Ali withdraws from PSL for Mecca pilgrimage
Moeen Ali has opted out of participating in the second season of the Pakistan Super League and will instead join members of his family on a pilgrimage to Mecca. Moeen, who is currently in India with England's limited-overs squad, was named yesterday as a replacement for Carlos Brathwaite in the Quetta Gladiators squad.
He had been negotiating through his agent as to his exact availability when the clash of priorities became apparent. Quetta were quickly informed of his change of plans, and Moeen has now been replaced by the veteran Australian, Brad Hodge, who represented Peshawar Zalmi in last season's inaugural tournament.

"We respect his decision to honour his family commitment first. Good Luck Moeen." Moeen, a devout Muslim, first performed umrah in November 2009, and credited the inspirational' experience for a flying start to his county season with Worcestershire the following year.
"I think I came back nice and fresh after that,' he said at the time. "It makes a person strong and it was a chance to just get away from cricket".

Nadal closes in on Federer final
MELBOURNE, Wednesday: Rafael Nadal edged closer to a much-anticipated Australian Open final with his great rival Roger Federer after marching into the semi-finals on Wednesday.
The 14-time Grand Slam champion was too powerful for injury-hit world number three Milos Raonic, winning 6-4, 7-6 (9/7), 6-4 in two hours 44 minutes.
The Spanish superstar will play Bulgaria's 15th seed Grigor Dimitrov in Friday's semi-final. He leads Dimitrov 7-1.
Nadal preferred to focus on his next match with Dimitrov rather than contemplating a ninth Grand Slam final showdown with Federer, but he paid tribute to the Swiss legend for his amazing run at this year's Australian Open.
"Let me enjoy today, the victory, being in semi-final. For me is great news again. It's a good start of the season," he told reporters. "Now I have a very tough match against Dimitrov.
"Whatever happens on the other side of the draw, I think it is great for tennis that Roger is there again after an injury, after a lot of people talked that probably he would never be back".
"The real thing is that he's back and he's probably ready to win again, fighting again to win a major".
"That's good for the fans because Roger is a legend of our sport. I am happy to be there, too. I am focused on my semi-final".
" It was another accomplished performance from the 30-year- old Spaniard who reached his first Grand Slam semi-final since he won the 2014 French Open, and struggled with injury last year.
"Great. It's good news. Especially winning against difficult players: (Gael) Monfils in quarter-finals, (Alexander) Zverev round of 16 and now Raonic," Nadal said.
"All of them are top players. So that's very important for me because that means that I am competitive and playing well".
"I'm so just excited about being back in final rounds of the most important events." It was the 30-year- old Spaniard's fifth Australian Open semi-final and his 24th in Grand Slams.
Nadal is bidding to win his second Australian Open title and become the first man in the Open era - and only the third man in history - to win each of the four Grand Slam titles twice. AFP

NCCSL calls for national trade policy, anti-dumping regulations
The National Chamber of Commerce said it is an absolute necessity to have a national trade policy for Sri Lanka which will govern and provide directions to any trade agreements to be signed by Sri Lanka with any other country.
This is following Sri Lanka negotiating many preferential agreements with larger and stronger economies such as India, China and Singapore. The newly elected National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka President Sujeewa Samaraweera speaking at the 58th annual general meeting of the Chamber noted that with the background of Sri Lanka entering into the free trade agreements with very strong economies in the near future, it is also vital to implement anti-dumping regulations in Sri Lanka.
In other words a common mechanism to protect our domestic industries from unfair trade practices is a absolute necessity.He said the chamber also welcomes the decision of the European Union to grant the GSP + facility to Sri Lanka which will have a positive impact on the countrys exports to Europe,since Sri Lankas export pricing will become competitive and will generate more market opportunities.
In return investments in the country also may go up with a positive impact on employment generation and GDP and narrow the current account deficit, Samaraweera said.
The chamber plans to implement well focused development programs and will form business facilitation counters for business interaction between local companies.
The Chamber will also continue to work on SMEs by facilitating their business interaction by creating a virtual marketplace at the chamber to create synergies.

PAFFREL to introduce method to judge candidates
"We will introduce a method for people to judge/measure candidates who contest in upcoming Local Government Elections, People's Action For Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said.
He said still no political party has declared how they will select candidates to give nominations. The number of representatives have been doubled from 4,000 to 8,000 increasing people's burden.
Addressing a press conference held at the Hector Kobbekaduwa Agrarian Research and Training Institute in Colombo yesterday he said that since the preferential vote system is no more, the sole right to select candidates will go to the political parties and the voters will only receive three lists of names to select their candidates. Since the voters do not have a choice, they need to select the best candidate without sticking into one political party. They should select the best candidate no matter from which political party he/she is contesting from.
According to Hettiarachchi, it is the responsibility of all political parties to give nominations to good and non corrupted candidates without giving nominations to husbands, wives, siblings, children, and relations of politicians, thieves, thugs, and racketeers who do not have qualification and required knowledge to handle public affairs. They should not be given nominations forcing the public to vote for them.
The March 1st Movement will launch a countrywide awareness raising campaign to educate the public on selecting good candidates to represent them in the Local Government bodies. The campaign will commence from Colombo on March 13 and will go on covering the entire country. The negative political culture can be changed into a positive one with the contribution of the entire society, he said.
Representatives of the member organisations of the March 1st Movement also spoke.

Based on AGs report:: COPE investigating bonds transaction from 2008-2015: COPE Chairman
The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) has begun an investigations into the bonds transaction from 2008-2015, based on the report submitted by the Auditor General.
COPE Chairman and JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti who met Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday morning, had informed him that the Committee has begun investigations on previous instances of the bonds issued by the Central Bank for the last eight years from 2008. The Auditor General submitted a report consisting of an analysis on direct placement of government securities in the past eight years to the COPE Secretariat on January 17. The report was compiled following a request from Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
MP Handunnetti, making a clarification on the accusation of Finance Minister Karunanayake that MP Bimal Rathnayake tabled the Auditor Generals report which should have been originally received by the minister, said the Auditor General had first submitted the report to the Finance Ministry on January 16. A private secretary to the Minister had signed and received it on January 17. The AG has sent copies of the same report to the COPE and the CB Governor. I asked MP Bimal Rathnayake to get that report as I was out of the country, Handunnetti said.
There is no govt. called TGTE in existence: Foreign Minister

The Government yesterday, insisted that there was no government in existence called the Transnational Government of Tamil Eelam(TGTE), but added that it was aware of a self-styled group of persons calling themselves TGTE.
This was stated by Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera to a question raised by Pivithuru Hela Urumaya Leader Udaya Gammanpila in Parliament yesterday. The minister stressed that no country, no government, no member state of the UN, no international organization or legal entity has recognized this self-styled group as a government or a government in exile.
Replying to a question by Gammanpila as to whether he admits that Australian and Denmark Governments have displayed the name of Tamil Eelam in their websites as a legitimate state, the minister said both countries took immediate action to rectify the error after it was brought to the attention of the relevant authorities.
The Australian Bureau of Statistics (ABS had listed Tamil Eelam as a country classification on its website, which could be selected as the country of birth for the Australian census of 2016. The High Commission of Sri Lanka in Australia, brought this to the attention of the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade on August 8, 2016. Following which, they took steps to remove Tamil Eelam the very next day. The Chief of the ABS had written to Sri Lanka High Commission informing that ABS had never recognized Tamil Eelam as a country and assuring that the term will not appear in any data published from the census, Samaraweera said.
He added the Australian Government in November 2016, extended the ban on the LTTE for a further period of three years.
Tamil Eelam has been listed as a country eligible for Danish visas on Danish Immigration Service website in September 2016. The Danish Ministry of Foreign Affairs took immediate high priority action to probe this and rectified what they termed as an inadvertent error and mistake made by the Danish Immigration on its website. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Denmark has also apologized on behalf of the Danish Government, he explained.
The minister who was replying to supplementary questions of Gammanpila, said the TGTE is a self-styled group with no recognition similar to Joint Opposition in Parliament. The JO too is not legitimately recognized by Parliament. However, you are free to live in your own fantasies. This applies to both the TGTE and the JO, he said.
New Bill to determine subjects coming under ministries: Ranil Wickremesinghe
Parliament should decide as to what the Committee of the House should receive reports from the Auditor General on the Treasury Bond issue during the past since 2008 and act accordingly, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament when the Finance Minister inquired as to how COPE received reports from the Auditor General direct and not those tabled in Parliament. He also said that the Auditor General has acted unprofessionally by failing to submit a report on past bond issues which was requested by him.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that there were several committees in Parliament which dealt with financial matters. He added that there were several oversight committees in function that could deal with such matters. He suggested that Parliament decide as to which committee should deal with finances.The Premier also said that a new Bill would be presented in the House to determine the subjects that come under the ministries.
Possibility of holding O/L and A/L examinations in December to be looked into: PM
The possibility to hold both the Ordinary Level and the Advanced Level Examinations in December is being looked into, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
He said the aim is to minimize the time the students have to idle after sitting the AL exam until university admission. The Prime Minister said if school holidays in December could be extended for a few more days and if the number of schools taken as examination centers are increased, this plan could be implemented.
He made this observation in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP leader Anura Dissanayake under Standing Order 23 (2). The MP pointed out that students who sit for the AL exam, have to wait for about 18 - 20 months for university admission. He pointed out this long delay had caused many difficulties in filling the existing vacancies at State Universities.
The MP revealed that 698 vacancies exist at State universities with regard to the student enrollment in 2015. Many students are waiting for university admission, but the UGC has failed to admit students to fill in the existing vacancies at the Universities. I request the Higher Education Minister to hold a meeting with all relevant parties including the UGC, Examinations Department and the Deans of Science Faculties to discuss a practical solution to minimize the delay in recruitment to State Universities. We too will attend discussions, Dissanayake said.
Minister Kiriella admitting that there was a delay in the process, agreed to hold a discussion in this regard. The Prime Minister intervening at this point, said a mechanism to minimize the delay in university admissions was being looked at.
AG has never informed anybody he was forced by UNP members
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya or the UNP leadership or the Chairman of COPE Committee had not been informed by the Auditor General that he had been forced by UNP Parliamentarians, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
The Premier made this observation yesterday when JVP Parliamentarian Bimal Rathnayake stated that UNP Parliamentarians continued to threaten the Auditor General at the COPE Committee during his speech.
The Premier stated that the Speaker, himself as the leader of the UNP or the Parliament have not been informed by the Auditor General that he was threatened by UNP Parliamentarians. He added that Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva spoke on few f his foot notes in Parliament and it was a right of his.
The Premier further said that the Acts had been amended to finalize functions and the duties of the ministers. He added that a policy decision was taken to keep the Foreign Reserves Department, Central Bank and the Ministry that formulates the budget. He added that the same decision was taken since the previous government had taken loans from foreign reserves and the Central Bank and placed the country in jeopardy. He also said that according to the policy changes, the Finance Minister has powers to instruct the Central Bank on specified matters.
The Premier made this observation when Joint Opposition Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said that according to the changes made under this government, the Finance Act and the Central Bank came under the purview of the Prime Minister not under the Finance Minister.
Responding to Bandula Gunawardena, Minister Karunanayake said that it was the Finance Minister who had been vested with the powers of implementing under the relevant Act.
JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake said that Central Bank was under the Prime Minister and the Finance Act was under the Finance Minister and this has been the cause of issues. He added that there was unrest in the country over the Treasury Bond issue. "Therefore the need arose to inspect all Treasury bonds issuance in the past not only the recent one," MP Dissanayake said. "Accordingly, the Finance Minister sent for certain information with regard to bond sales. The Auditor General sent thee information to the COPE".
At this stage, the Premier said that there were provisions in the law enabling the Finance Minister to instruct the Central Bank on certain issues. "There is nothing wrong in investigating Treasury Bond sales from 2008," the Premier said. " What I said was that to investigate the Treasury Bond sales of 2015 first. If the rest was investigated first, the others would say that we did so to delay investigations on the recent issue. We needed to maintain transparency."
Audit Bill still being drafted
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe observed that the Audit Bill was being drafted, adding thatthe Auditor General and the Finance Minister should sit together and make decisions with regard to the contents of the bill and then be presented to the Cabinet.The Premier made these observations in Parliament yesterday, in response to Opposition Member Dinesh Gunawardena's queries as to when the government would give powers to the Independent Audit Commission
No reason to reveal sensitive details of Treasure Bond issuances
There had not been any reason for the Auditor General to reveal the sensitive details of the Treasury Bond issuances to anybody else other than those who were entitled to, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in Parliament yesterday.
He made these observations adding to what Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake said that the Attorney General had instructed the Auditor General in writing on February 12, 2004, not to reveal sensitive matters of the Central Bank to anybody other than the Governor.
"There had been no need to reveal sensitive matters due to two reasons," said Premier Wickremesinghe. "First being that he had to report on the process and second being that he had said that he had no expert knowledge to access the loss incurred from the Treasury Bond issue."
At this stage JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake said that it was the same letter used to conceal the details of the Central Bank from Parliament.

Pinnacle of patriotism
Politicians of doubtful character have often found a niche and taken prominent parts in the governance of the country. They took centre stage with their strident words that covered their charade of patriotism under which they did not hesitate to exploit this country for their personal advantage.
These bogus patriots would abuse the power the people have vested in them to usurp their office and to misuse agencies and personnel of the government for their nefarious private purposes and make as much money as possible and build palatial houses for themselves and their kith and kin all the while accusing others of conspiratorial activities. They have gained millions through their politics in the last government and ensconced their catchers and henchmen in positions in which they safely engage in corrupt practices.
Patriots live honourably
True Sri Lankans  fortunately, the vast majority of the citizens of Sri Lanka  of all communities and religions in this country have been confined to the background for a very long time. They have been silently earning their living by the sweat of their brow, by working hard, attending to their duties and sacrificing themselves to educate and bring up their children to live honourably.
Patriotism is devotion to the Fatherland. The Fatherlands territory and all the people who live in that territory are sacred. Territory, its resources and people should be developed and maintained. Opponents of the government pose as patriots even though they were ravenous wolves when they were in power. Yahapalanaya politicians presenting themselves as sober minded rulers promised to ensure congenial social conditions for all to live in harmony and peace. They professed to promote inter-community and inter-religious understanding and reconciliation while striving to bring about democratic openness to human rights, freedom, equality, social cohesion and economic prosperity.
The carefree attitude of some government members and many of the joint opposition with their vague political vision and some public servants seem to be undermining that promise; some public servants deliberately undermine reconciliation and peace by acting dishonourably and sewing seeds of religious and racial discord.
Opportunity missed through greed
Much could have been achieved immediately after the defeat of the LTTE and the cessation of hostilities. That the war was not against the Tamil people but against an armed insurrection could have been convincingly demonstrated if, after the war, there was genuine goodwill and willingness to promote island-wide reconciliation at all levels of the national community.
The powerful people of the day let pass that opportunity due to their political greed. Today active reconciliation is promoted by some civic and religious groups convinced of the positive attitudes transmitted by their social traditions and religious beliefs towards all humanity, while others are still enslaved in their prejudices.
But the past regime from their inherited tradition and political cunning ingrained in the xenophobic anti-Tamil, anti-Muslim, anti-minority mentality could not divest themselves of their prejudices sufficiently to win the hearts and minds of the nominal Sinhala Buddhists remaining gullible to a false propaganda of politically correct Buddhism. The corrupt, socially deficient Rajapaksa regime that corrupted the public service and other segments of society seemed to be planning to reincarnate a feudal mentality and establish a monarchical dynasty. That the people of Sri Lanka had long passed the feudal stage and had moved towards a democratic way of life and participatory government was not within their grasp, lacking as they were of an intellectual calibre needed for today and sobriety of judgment. Superiority and inferiority complexes of the past regime and their penchant to manipulate people distorted their judgments on many matters.
Coarseness instead of culture
They not only did not understand what patriotism is, they also mishandled public administration, which they presumed was an area they could resort to towards an unrestricted exercise of power irrespective of whether such exercise was in order or irregular, just or unjust, fair or unfair.
This was often exhibited in the coarse ways they used public property and money for electoral campaigns and private purposes. Power blinded their reason, warped their humanity making their behaviour not only ill-mannered and boorish but downright uncivilized and brutal on far too many occasions when they ignored the peoples plea for justice but responded to them with bullets.
At least on the surface, everyone is a patriot in Sri Lanka. It is especially so among the politicians aligned to the defeated regime continuing to be unashamedly chauvinistic. Their populist movements lower and downgrade everyone outside their narrow racist, fascist, xenophobic existence. They are leading the people to a cultural crisis and a perilous political horizon.
Their patriotism amounts to suspicion, racism, negative feelings and even demonization of those disagreeing with their political stances. Underneath it also lie envy, jealousy, fear, unhealed wounds of the past caused by ideological and superficial political differences.
They are unable to understand patriotism as a natural love for the Fatherland, inherited by the clean-hearted from the community into which one is born and in which one has cultivated a loyalty with a desire to pass it on as a living tradition worthy of self-sacrifice. They are unable to understand that love of the Fatherland and all that is of value in it need not undermine a true love of every group of people inhabiting the Land or for that matter, all humanity inhabiting the globe.
Corrupt lack honour
Many politicians have not understood that patriotism is not compatible with deceiving the people of this country, and by-passing the people in favour of their own relatives and political catchers in allocating ambassadorial and lucrative positions, state corporation managerial posts as well as houses, lands and loan facilities. Patriotism is in no way compatible with deceiving state authorities or agencies of state, roaming the world without attending in parliamentary sittings and attending to the public duties one has been elected to do.
The corrupt few contaminate many with their detestable infection. It is up to the majority of true Sri Lankans to become immune to this viral infection and resist and withstand the onslaught of corruption by living honourably and handing over a self-respecting tradition of honour to the younger generation. They should also be consistent and elect true Sri Lankans and not bogus patriots to represent them. Of what profit is life unless it be lived in mutual and honourable sharing

## Title: Plastic Pandoras Box

Plastic Pandoras Box
The global narrative on plastic is well known at this point: thousands of tonnes of plastic debris end up in the oceans and languish for hundreds, if not thousands, of years in landfills the world over. The Great Pacific garbage patch, an island composed mostly of plastic, is about the size of India, Europe, and Mexico combined, and approximately six times more plastic trash than plankton is in the North Pacific Ocean.
Plastic bags, containers, and bottles litter the streets of cities everywhere, and the problem seems to be getting worse, as more countries churn out plastic products because of their relative inexpensiveness.
Plastic is also a petroleum product, and about 8 percent of the worlds oil production goes toward manufacturing it. There is also evidence that plastic can adversely affect the quality of ground and drinking water.
While the environmental hazards of plastic are known and well chronicled, its effects on human health are less notorious.
With the hope of raising the publics awareness of the health hazards of plastic, Believers in Glass, a movement linked with Piramal Glass Ceylon PLC, recently held a press conference in Colombo. A panel of doctors spent the morning sharing details of the frightening evidence that exposure to chemicals in plastics is linked to wide-ranging diseases and disorders, such as cancers, infertility, diabetes, asthma, and kidney disease.
Endocrine disruptors
One of the panels main areas of focus was the potential for plastics to leach the toxic chemicals bisphenol A (BPA), styrene, and polyvinyl chloride (PVC) when they are heated, worn down, or put under pressure.
Once these chemicals leach out from the plastic and into drinks, medicines, and food products, they can easily make their way into the bodys systems and wreak havoc on the endocrinesystem, which is responsible for producing and maintaining hormones.
Chemicals from plastic are inside of us and are present in blood and urine in measurable amounts, Dr. Mamta Jain, the events moderator, said.
The plastic chemicals can act as various hormon
es in the body, making them endocrine disruptors. Metabolism, growth, development, organisation, sexual function, and even our mood, are affected to a large extent by endocrine hormones. Once these extraneous plastic chemicals, endocrine disruptor chemicals, enter the system, they are not controlled by our normal mechanisms that maintain the hormone balances, said Prof. Kolitha Sellahewa, Head of the Department of Medicine at the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine. By throwing off the natural hormone balances within people, these plastic chemicals disrupt the normal body processes and can cause the regular hormone levels to increase or decrease.
While this situation might not sound so dire, the doctors explained that these chemicals have been linked with all sorts of diseases and disorders.
There is strong evidence that endocrine disruptors increase the risk of obesity and asthma. Also, people exposed to the chemicals can develop a resistance to insulin later in life, causing them to develop diabetes, Sellahewa said.
With advancing age, women can get breast cancers, and studies have shown that these breast cancer cells proliferate much faster upon exposure to these endocrine disruptor chemicals, he continued.
Several doctors added that instances of testicular and prostate cancer have been increasing. They insisted that the evidence pointed to environmental factors like exposure to plastic chemicals as a driving force in these increases.
BPA, styrene, and PVC, among substances, have been shown to cause diseases in adults, but they have also been linked to increasing infertility in both men and women.
Infertility
Dr. Suranga Hettipathirana, a consultant obstetrician and gynecologist, shared that the plastic chemicals can damage the genetic material itself within females eggs and males sper
ms, which leads directly to miscarriage and infertility.
Females are born with all the eggs they will ever have. Women and girls are getting exposed to these chemicals for their whole lives, which means that their eggs are also being exposed for a long time. So there can be lots of changes in the genes over this period, he said.
About half of miscarriages, he said, are due to genetic problems within the developing fetus DNA. It follows, then, that the changes to genes caused by these chemicals are making the population less fertile. But infertility problems are by no means limited to women, as Hettipathirana said that it is the male partner who is infertile in over 50 percent of couples that see him about having problems conceiving.
When you look at sperm, they are produced in millions. A small thing, like a problem in the environment, can cause various complications with production. The quality of sperm goes down, whic
h is causing male factor infertility to increase, he said.
So many young couples are coming in, and we are finding that the male partners sperm counts are low for no obvious reason. I think the chemicals in food and drinking water are playing a
major role, said Professor Neville D.. Perera of the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine.
Sellahewa, for his part, described the process by which men are rendered infertile by endocrine disruptors:
These endocrine disruptor chemicals are toxic to the two kinds of cells in the testes that are responsible for the sperm production and the testosterone production, respectively, he said.
There is a very clear link on the toxicity of these chemicals to both kinds of cells. The end result is you get a male with reduced capacity to produce sperms and to produce testosterone, which is the most important male hormone, he added.
The American Society for Reproductive Medicine and International Federation of Fertility Societies published a joint paper on their findings that endocrine disruptor chemicals cause male infertility through damaging the cells that produce sperm.
Effects on children
The panel made sure to specify that both fetuses and young children are especially vulnerable to damage from these chemicals.
The toxins that a mother consumes, according to the doctors, are easily diffused through the placenta and can be absorbed by the fetus. Male child can get exposed to harmful levels of these artificial, hormone-like substances which can directly affect his testes. Two risks then follow: One is that his fertility has been negatively effected, and the other one is that he has a higher propensity to get testicular cancer, said Perera.
Furthermore, fetuses can suffer some degree of genetic damage from these chemicals while in the womb, which leaves them more vulnerable to cancer, asthma, and obesity later in life.
But young children, too, are particularly vulnerable to damage from these chemicals, the doctors said. I see, as a practicing pediatrician, that a lot of mothers are using plastic feeding bottles for their babies. These are heated and reused, which makes leaching very likely, and I think its not very good to be using them, said Dr. Lakkumar Fernando, President of the Sri Lanka College of Pediatricians.
Plastic draggingwildlife into jeopardy
While various studies have claimed to determine a safe limit of leached plastic chemicals, Fernando contended that no science can reliably determine this limit.
One of the things the plastic industry says to defend themselves is that there is a permissible amount of leach. Those things are brought to safeguard the industry. Exposure in whatever amount of permissible level also can be harmful, he said. We should take measures to protect our babies and avoid exposure in whatever amounts, he added.
Policy action
Much of the press conference focused on the effects of plastic on human health, but the latter parts of it dealt with prudent policy directives that the panel thought would save lives.
Many countries, predominantly in Europe, have taken action to ban or limit the use of various plastic products, from plastic bags to water tanks. Sri Lanka, however, has not taken any such action.
I think it would not be a bad idea for the government to take a strong policy to try and altogether ban the infant feeding bottle at least for babies, Fernando said.
Sellahewa, moreover, called for increased reviews of plastic quality and chemicals: Is plastic being tested anywhere in the country If so, where it is It is a big question. He also called for the phasing out of PVC water pipes, which many countries have banned, and plastic water tanks. Earlier there were cement and stainless steel tanks. When the British were here, they used steel tanks. But due to rust, we changed to plastic. These react according to temperature. Plastic tanks should be covered to avoid the suns rays, he said. The doctors and moderators both called on the media to help spread this information, as the average citizen uses a good deal of plastic and does not know about its deleterious effects on human health.

PPUF to demo against sale of Colombo Ports Eastern Terminal
The Ports Protection Union Front (PPUF) will hold a demonstration against the sale of the Eastern Terminal of the Colombo Port by the Government in front of the Presidential Secretariat on February 1, with the participation of all progressive forces, other trade unions and Ports
employees.
The President of National Trade Union Center and Member of the Political Bureau of the JVP K. D. Lalkantha said yesterday, that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was engaged in selling main economic centres in the country according to his wish. President Maithripala Sirisena who was elected by the people could step in to stop these attempts.
It was revealed that an agreement in this regard was to be signed on February 2. That was the reason why we wish to stop this move and meet the President to discuss this matter with him, Lalkantha said.
He said the Prime Minister is trying to sell all the countrys assets to save his own skin, adding that the 440 metres of the jetty had been completed and comprising of an eighteen metre jetty wall and a 22 hectare area with facilities for development from the Ports Authority. The terminal was dredged to the depth of 18 metres to accommodate bigger ships.
Selling this terminal to a foreign company would cause a heavy loss to the Ports Authority since it was generating a massive income to the country.
All constructions of the Eastern Terminal have already been completed at present and only the machinery has to be installed. Once the machinery is installed, the terminal would make a huge profit. It has been estimated that the process of installing the machinery, including the importing of them, would take around 11 months. It is then clear that from the 12th month on wards, the terminal would make profits. So, it is a big devastation, if this terminal would be sold to a foreign company, Lalkantha said.
The Hambantota Harbour would be given to China and the Trincomalee Port to India. Accordingly, all the ports would be sold to other countries for the economic survival of the government. Therefore, we invite all patriotic forces to join our struggle on February 1, he said.
He said the Ports Minister appointed by the President says he knew nothing about this. So, we are certain that the Prime Minister is doing this even without the knowledge of the Ports Minister, he further said.
He also said the Engineers Association and trade unions in the Port have a systematic plan that could be used to make the Colombo Port into a profitable organization without going for privatization. So, we urge the President to give us the opportunity to discuss this matter, he said.
The All Ceylon Port General Employees Union General Secretary Chandrasiri Mahagamage, said the Ports Authority earned a considerable revenue today which channels to the Treasury for the welfare of the public. The Eastern Terminal which was the biggest terminal of the Colombo Port and selling it to a foreign company would decrease the revenue and put the jobs of its employees at risk.
He said the government is trying to sell the Trincomalee Port to India. But we are able to earn a huge revenue from its oil tanks alone.
Convernor of the Voice Against Corruption and JVP Politburo Member Wasantha Samarasinghe, said even if the President was there, the government was running according to the wishes of the Prime Minister.
We urge the President to intervene in to the selling of our national assets by the Prime Minister who has no mandate from the people. He is trying to sell our national assets to appease foreign forces that supported him to come into power. He also knows that once he retired from his job, he could get a good job in a foreign country or a Western Organization, if he works according to their agendas, he said.

Prasanna and Dickwella haul Sri Lanka to series victory

Sri Lanka spoiledAB de Villiers' comeback by snatching the T20 series from South Africa to claim the first silverware in the country in their history.
Niroshan Dickwella's career-best 68 overshadowed de Villiers' 63, in his first international outing in six months, as Sri Lanka chased down 170 with one ball remaining but it wasSeekkuge Prasanna's 16-ball 37 which completed the second highest successful chase at Newlands.
South Africa were without their newest spearhead, 20-year-old Lungi Ngidi, for most of their time in the field after he bruised his hip, and he could not bowl his final two overs, but had a tardy fielding effort rather than lack of resources to blame for their inability to defend the total. They put down five catches in total and saw several more aerial chances go unclaimed to allow Sri Lanka some leeway in what was a tough task.
Still, it took cool heads for Sri Lanka's batsmen to cross the line, especially afterImran Tahirremoved their stand-in captain Dinesh Chandimal early on and then removed Dickwella and Dhananjaya de Silva in the same over. 
Sri Lanka had to rebuild their innings twice and eventually needed 26 runs off the last two overs. Against the inexperience of Andile Phehlulwayo and debutant Dane Paterson, Prasanna and Asela Gunaratne got there to seal a memorable win.
By the time the 19th over began, Prasanna already had 23 off 10 balls - having brought the target down from a daunting 50 off 21 balls - but Gunaratne had yet to score a run and only faced one ball after Kusal Mendis was run-out in the previous over. The pair ran hard off the first and second deliveries before Prasanna advanced on a Phehlukwayo slower ball and sent it over long-on for six. He did not get hold of the next one, losing his bat as he swung, but finished the over with a ramp over the Mangaliso Mosehle's head to leave Paterson with 11 to defend off the last over.
Gunaratne took the pressure off the final passage of play with a scoop over fine leg for four and took quick singles before he swung across the line and top-edged over Mosehle to level scores. In his excitement, Gunaratne thought the match was over and grabbed a stump out of the ground in celebration only to be told he needed one run was still needed. He drove the penultimate ball through the covers and this time could keep the stump.
Having threatened through the series, with 43 in Centurion and 22 in Johannesburg, Dickwella went one better and converted his start into his first T20 half-century. He had support from Upul Tharanga, who was playing in his first T20 since the World T20 in 2012, and was aggressive from the get-go. The pair punished width early on and took on the short ball and it took a change of pace to separate them.
Tharanga lobbed a catch to mid-on off Wayne Parnell's first ball, a slower delivery, to give South Africa a breakthrough but it was when stand-in captain Dinesh Chandimal was bowled by Tahir's first delivery that Sri Lanka were under real pressure. Tahir's over went boundary-less and then a hat-trick of missed chances came off Parnell's second over, including a return catch, with Dickwella surviving two of those chances. He made South Africa pay.
He saw off Tahir and targeted Phehlukwayo at first, before switching gears and lapping Tahir but South Africa's complications came when they needed a replacement for Ngidi after he injured his hip diving at cover. Jon-Jon Smuts had to fill in but his two overs cost 22 runs as Dickwella reached fifty off 34 balls.
With five overs to go, Sri Lanka needed more than ten an over but would have been fairly comfortable with Dickwella well settled. Tahir had an over in hand, though, and appeared to have changed the game. He had Dickwella caught in the deep and de Silva stumped to turn things South Africa's way but Sri Lanka had more muscle.
In the end, South Africa might blame their middle-order problems for not posting a big enough total. They lost 4 for 28 runs in 25 balls between the 14th and 18th over, including de Villiers which may have been the difference.
South Africa trialled a new opening partner for Smuts in Reeza Hendricks and it proved a good decision. While Smuts continued to show nothing more than glimpses of the potential that took him to the top of the domestic T20 competition run-charts, Hendricks had the composure for a longer stay and formed one half of the hosts' major partnership on the night
After Smuts was given out lbw, Hendricks was joined by de Villiers and was happy to cede control to the senior man, but not before a third perfectly timed offside drive to the end the PowerPlay strongly.
De Villiers initially played within himself before giving making room to drive through point for his first boundary. He did not focus on finding the rope too many more times early on, though, and strike-rotation with a partner who was as speedy as him formed the foundation of their scoring. Every single was cheered loudly, twos and a solitary three were even more appreciated but there was no doubt the crowd was expecting more. When de Villiers danced down the track to meet a Lakshan Sandakan delivery on the full and send it straight back over his head for six, Newlands erupted. Their superstar was back.
A scoop off Gunaratne saw de Villiers overtake Hendricks before the latter was stumped. Hendricks will not be happy with his carelessness when he dragged his foot out against Sandakan after the ball spun across him and he failed to push his foot behind the line. Chandimal needed two attempts to complete the stumping and, still, Hendricks did not inch further back.
Despite that wicket bringing South Africa's most dangerous hitter, David Miller, to the crease, Sri Lanka had created an opening to claw their way back. Miller, Farhaan Behardien and de Villiers all departed and South Africa entered the final two overs on 141 for 5 without one of their regular finishers on hand. Nuwan Kulasekara did an exceptional job in his final two overs which only cost 11 and removed de Villiers.
Mosehle took the opportunity to show what he could do with a stunning cameo. He plundered three sixes off the first four balls in the last over, which cost Isuru Udana 21, and took South Africa's total over 160 but it was not enough.

President Sirisena will make correct decisions at right time: WPC Minister
President Sirisena will make correct decisions at the right time and the price reduction of lottery tickets was one of them, Western Provincial Council Minister Gamini Thilakasiri said.
The Joint Opposition (JO) seek to topple this government, but it will only be a dream, he said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said this government will continue till 2020 and no one will be able to topple it.
Even though the JO will organise a rally in Nugegoda on January 27 with the aim of taking over the power by toppling this government, It will never happen and it is only an attempt to deceive people by giving false promises.
"The JO wants to bring a crowd and close down some roads and hold the rally on January 27. So many such rallies were in the past, he said.
"They also went on several "Pada Yathras as well. At each one, they said they would topple the government. But nothing happened," he said.
He said MPs Dinesh Gunawardene, Wimal Weerawansa, Bandula Gunawardene, and Udaya Gammanpila organised these rallies. They are not SLFP members. This country has only two major parties. Nobody can emerge victorious by breaking a party. They can go on like this only for sometime.
He said that if the JO members do not continue with rallies at least ones in two months, they cannot survive. They also have to give people false promises. Otherwise they cannot continue.
Sri Jayawardenepura-Kotte Mayor Janaka Ranawaka said the SLFP got defeated because of the Rajapaksas domination. Basil Rajapaksa hijacked many ministries, and it was the major reason for the SLFPs defeat.
Basil gave many World Bank contracts to his henchmen. The organising post of the new party had again given to the Basil Rajapaksa to destroy the SLFP, he said.

Previous regime was unable to open even one factory: Kiriella
The previous regime was unable to commence a single new factory. Existing factories began to shutdown including 20 in the Kandy District. A factory in Pallekele under an Indian company with around 3,000 employees was shutdown during the previous regime, Leader of the House, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The minister was addressing the opening ceremony of a new Maganeguma consultancy office in Ratmalana, Angulana on January 20.
He said the country's present situation had changed where all communities could live as one under Good Governance.
"The Prime Minister is making many efforts to get investors to come to our country. A programme is conducted to handover job opportunities to the youth. The Opposition cannot stand this.
The previous regime lost the election. The peoples mandate is with the President, the Prime Minister, and the United National Front. Unlike the previous regime, we do not trouble others over political reasons. We pledged to strengthen our good governance and take our country forward, Kiriella said.
Protests are held to prevent investments from coming into the country.
The country is governed according to the peoples mandate. Employment cannot be given only through government jobs. New jobs could be created if only factories emerge. For that to happen, investors must come to the country, the minister said.
Private Secretary to the Minister Chamindranee Kiriella, Maganeguma Consultancy Company Chairman Janaka Herath, Road Development Authority Chairman Nihal Sooriyaarachchi, Director General Rohitha Swarna and other invitees were present.

(Marangoni of Italy) was, said Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, responding to a question raised by a Journalist about the process of setting up of the Tyre Plant in Horana.

The process of setting up of the Tyre Plant had been suspended, the minister said, addressing the media yesterday at the Government Information Department.
When questioned as to whether the Prime Minister along with several ministers were investing without informing the Cabinet, Minister Senaratne said earlier, the economic committee reports the decisions to the Cabinet and the Cabinet approves them, but now President Maithripala Sirisena has instructed the committee to refer it to the relevant Minister and the relevant Minister will present it to the Cabinet. .
When asked about Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe having connections with the person who had close relationship with Rajapaksas, Minister Senaratne said they did not only have close relationships but it is their money.
When asked whether the investment board was aware of it, Minister Senaratne said that he was not was not aware and he will look in to it.
Responding to a question about MP Namal Rajapaksas request to arrest Arjuna Aloysis, Minister Senaratne said until January 8 2015, he was with Namal Rajapaksa.
Now he must be angry when he has connections with the other people. Clearly, must be someone with in the cabinet and we will take action against them as well, he added.
