BRI initiative, a huge opportunity for Sri Lanka
The Belt and Road initiative (BRI) from China and currently one of the largest trade and investment themes will create a huge opportunity for many industries in Sri Lanka said Suren Rajakarier, Partner, KPMG & Vice Chairman of ACCA member network panel.
Speaking at ACCA hosted CEO forum on the implications for Sri Lanka on the BRI initiative he said that the BRI initiative was not just about exports to China. It takes into account the countries along the BRI that have their own unique and valuable resources, which are highly complementary to one another and creates vast potential for cooperation.
It encourages countries to jointly collaborate, share and exchange to a larger, higher and deeper content in an equal and mutually beneficial way. This can be considered a major innovation in international cooperation.
Presenting findings from a local survey carried out jointly with KPMG on the awareness level and how the benefits of BRI will impact Sri Lanka he added that there was greater need for awareness among Sri Lankan corporates as only 38% believed BRI to be a boardroom discussion within the next 5 years. However, 52% of the respondents had plans to scale up capacity to meet growing demands.He also said that accountants too will have to play a key role in this sinario.
Professor of Tsinghua University International Center for Communication, Li Xiguan, outlining key visions of this venture, said it is about building a road of peace, prosperity, that connects different civilization, and in giving priority to major investment and foreign aid projects. It will deliver positive socioeconomic impacts, whilst also working to promote the liberalization and facilitation of trade and investment along the Belt and Road.
He explained that although the initiative was proposed by China, participation of other countries along the proposed routes and related countries was indispensable to its implementation. This initiative would serve to enhance economic interconnectivity and facilitate development across Eurasia, East Africa and more than 60 partner countries
The event included high profile experts comprising Rajendra Theagarajah Chairman Ceylon Chamber of Commerce & Managing Director of Cargills Bank , Dr Zhao Ying, Associate Director, China Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre of Pathfinder Foundation and Kelvin Tan - Regional Sales Director, South East Asia, CHEC Port City Colombo (Pvt) Ltd.
The panels opinion was that Sri Lankas strategic position in the middle of the maritime Silk Road, offered the opportunity of promoting the country as a trading hub in the Indian Ocean that could further improve trade and investment linkages with China and other partner countries including East Asia and Europe, that can be translated into concrete outcomes for the country in the future.

I dont feel old: Birthday boy Nadal after 900th win
PARIS, Monday : Rafael Nadal said he doesn't "feel old", after moving a step closer to an incredible 11th French Open title on Monday by beating German Maximilian Marterer to reach the quarter-finals the day after his 32nd birthday.
The world number one's 6-3, 6-2, 7-6 (7/4) victory over the world number 70 was his 900th win at tour level. It also saw him equal the record of 12 last-eight appearances at Roland Garros, which was set by Novak Djokovic the day before.
Top seed Nadal, who celebrated his birthday on Sunday, is now on his own in third on the all-time list for most match wins at Grand Slam events with 234 victories after passing Jimmy Connors."I don't feel old. But I am 32, and I have been here since 2003, so it's a long way, a lot of years," he said.
"I started very young. That's a real thing. But, no, I feel happy to be here. Being honest, I am enjoying the day by day on the tour and I hope to keep doing this for a while." Nadal powered 39 winners past Marterer, who pushed the Spaniard as hard as he could without ever threatening an upset.
He will face Argentinian Diego Schwartzman for a semi-final spot, after the 11th seed staged a thrilling comeback to down sixth seed Kevin Anderson 1-6, 2-6, 7-5, 7-6 (7/0), 6-2.
"It's always good to see him in the quarter-final because he's a good friend, a good person. He's a worker, and I'm happy to see him having all this success. Hopefully not too much (though)," smiled Nadal, who had a brief practice session with Schwartzman last week. The 16-time Grand Slam champion has now won 37 consecutive sets at Roland Garros, just four short of Bjorn Borg's record set between 1979 and 1981.
Nadal was caught cold in the opening stages as some big hitting from Marterer brought him the first two games. But it didn't take Nadal long to figure out his opponent, reeling off four straight games en route to an inevitable one-set lead. The 16-time Grand Slam champion raced through the second set in just 38 minutes, breaking his opponent's serve twice.
But Marterer -- who was playing in the main draw for the first time -- moved into a 3-1 lead early in the third as he threatened to become the first man to take a set off Nadal at Roland Garros since the Spaniard's 2015 quarter-final defeat by Djokovic. But the reigning champion quickly hit back before securing a tie-break on his second match point when Marterer fired long, celebrating with a trademark fist pump.  AFP

Physical exercise essential for reducing NCDs, obesity
Non-Communicable Diseases (NCDs) have become a global obstacles and it is a challenge here in Sri Lanka as well, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Addressing the launch of the National Nutrition Month (June) held in Colombo, recently, he said that the theme of this years National Nutrition Month is The Proper Way to Reduce Belly Fat. The main reason for obesity is lack of physical exercise and unhealthy food habits.
Minister Dr. Senaratne added that two surveys conducted in 2010 and 2015 on the obesity levels among Sri Lankan men and women, revealed that numbers of individuals either overweight or obese, had risen during that five-year period.
The minister said that since President Maithripala Sirisena and he himself allocate time for physical exercise, the rest of the country should find time to exercise as well, in order to prevent NCDs and from becoming overweight.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa, Health Services Director General Dr. Anil Jasinghe and others participated in physical exercises during the event.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History:
If theres a football World Cup shindig in heaven by the time we all pass, Id book a front row seat if the show ends with Roger Milla shaking those hips near a flag that rises up to his throat.
Milla had made it a habit. Hed come off the bench, score and then explode into an incredible routine by the corner flag. He gave the FIFA World Cup generous servings of joy gift wrapped with love from Mama Africa.
What sets Milla apart from the other legends of the game is that he shimmied his way into the hearts of billions at the age of 38 when most footballers would confine themselves to doing analyses from the studio or cooling off at some exotic beach that costs an arm and a leg to even stare at.
But Milla had started way back. In fact, at the age of 38, he was already a veteran, playing in the third World Cup of his career. Milla debuted for Cameroon 21 years before he became the oldest player to score in a World Cup in 1994 at Russia.
The buoyant forward played in the 1982 World Cup and was unfortunate to have his goal disallowed in the group stage game against Peru. Cameroon crashed out of the World Cup in the group stage.
Milla was in fact, phoned out of retirement by the countrys president Paul Biya in 1990 and nobody had any idea that this old man was going to become the footballs greatest pop culture blessing.
Out of all the games, it was his spectacular performance off the bench against Colombia in the last 16 clash that truly elevated him to the status of one of the greatest World Cup players. An ageing Milla could not get out and do what he does for the length of a game. So he stuffs his insane ability, compresses himself into a fireball and explodes for close to half an hour, every game.
And by doing that, he propelled Cameroon to unprecedented heights. After knowing that Milla scored two beauties against Romania in the group stages, Colombia should have been more wary about his presence on the pitch.
Milla came off the bench with the game deadlocked. He plays a delightful one-two with no. 7 Onam Biyik before flitting past the last defender like a 20-year-old and smashing the ball into the roof of the net to take the lead for Cameroon.
About 2 minutes later, Higuita and his central defenders were made to look like dummies by Roger Milla once again.
Higuita came way out of his lines to collect a clearance. Instead of booting it upfield, Higuita and his central defenders start passing the ball between themselves. Milla prances into the fore like the jaguar, the prime predator, steals the ball from El Loco himself and fires into an open net to put things beyond doubt. And of course, the world danced with him about 5 seconds later when he went to the corner flag to do his thing.
Milla scored 4 goals and won a penalty in the tournament. He set up a goal in the quarter-finals against England.
Roger Milla changed the way clubs looked at African footballers. That they could be unbridled in enthusiasm and goes beyond all expectations when it came to fitness and mentality was news for them.
Cameroon had earlier pulled a shock upset on the defending champions Argentina in the group stages and it would be fair to say that they stole the show at the World Cup and Roger Milla was at the centre of it all.
Dancing away at the corner flag, leaving the petite belly dancers of the world distressed and green-eyed.
For putting Cameroon on the World Cup map and for inspiring a plethora of incredulous goal celebrations, Roger Milla is one of our 50 Greatest World Cup Players.  sk

As more than one name was proposed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced to the House that a secret vote would be taken as per the Standing Orders.
He instructed the MPs to write the name of the candidate of their choice for the Deputy Speaker in the ballot card and sign it. He said the votes would be considered confidential and the Speaker will destroy the ballot papers later. As the quorum bell went off, the TNA and JVP MPs left the chamber.
The empty ballot box was displayed to the House by a Parliamentary Staff member at the commencement of the election and at the end of counting.
The Government members thumped their desks as the Speaker announced the results to the House. The Speaker congratulated the newly elected Deputy Speaker Kumarasiri stating that he is a senior Parliamentarian representing Parliament since 1996. He also extended his well-wishes for Dr. Fernandopulle and former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also joined in congratulating the new Deputy Speaker.
Deputy Speaker Kumarasiri thanking for the support given to him, said he would discharge his duties to his best cooperating with MPs of all political parties. Dr. Fernandopulle interpreted her defeat as a set-back for women in the country.

Best opportunity to invest in quality assurance
Quality assurance (QA) in higher education in Sri Lanka has embarked on a new platform. Sri Lanka will be hosting one of the significant international conferences in higher education in 2019 namely International Network on Quality Assurance and Accreditation in Higher Education (INQAAHE). Further, Asia Pacific Quality Assurance Network (APQN) will also take part in this endeavor. Many countries and regions will gather here to discuss the various factors affecting the quality of teaching and learning and to present the latest innovations and frontier QA developments.
International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE) is an international network with a noble mission to improve quality of Higher Education provisions into a global enhancement platform for quality assurance providers from all over the world. International Network for Quality Assurance Agencies in Higher Education (INQAAHE) is a world-wide association of nearly 300 organisations active in the theory and practice of quality assurance in higher education.
The great majority of its members are quality assurance agencies that operate in many different ways, although the Network also welcomes (as associate members) other organisations that have an interest in QA in Higher Education in the world.
INQAAHE offers members many services, including a Journal, a Bulletin, a Query service, a Good Practice database, funding for projects and funding for a Professional Qualification in Quality Assurance. There are also conferences and fora at least annually.
The Asia-Pacific Quality Network (APQN)
The Asia-Pacific Quality Network (APQN) is a non-governmental and non-profit network with 208 members from 40 countries and territories. Its aim is to enhance the quality of higher education in the Asia-Pacific Region through strengthening the work of quality assurance both internal and external organizations and extending the cooperation amongst each other for its ultimate goal of Dissolving Boundaries for a Quality Region.
Since APQNs inception in 2003, it has been continuously fighting to enhance the quality of higher education. After the 14-year development, APQN has become the largest and the most influential international organisation in this region. It has played a crucial role in improving the quality assurance mechanism, exchanging theory and practice experiences, promoting substantive co-operations among members and establishing quality platforms of APQR, APQL, Consultants and others in this Region.
The massive increase in external and internal quality assurance (QA) activity over recent decades, together with the associated thinking about it, have created a new profession that requires a structured academic discipline and programs to educate quality assurance professionals, stimulate research, and produce new initiatives.
Investment opportunities
All the State, Non-State partners in higher education will find it important in investing in such a significant conference. The proposed conference is scheduled to be held in Colombo with the participation of many international higher education quality assurance experts. State and Non  state higher education providers will be able to liaise with them in obtaining expertise in quality assurance activities.
The higher education sector in Sri Lanka will have immense opportunities on networking with other globally recognized partners in higher education and members of INQAAHE and APQN. Experience and the exposure will be valuable to carry forward the quality assurance activities of the higher education sector.
However, there is very little education and training in the world for the QA profession and its professionals. INQAAHE has now begun to fill this gap through the creation of a comprehensive program for the training and professional development of QA professionals. INQAAHE, through the considerable expertise of its members, has created materials that are available free on this website. The materials are intended as public advice and assistance in capacity-building in quality assurance and were developed by experts from around the world.
Higher education in Sri Lanka
According to the present scenario in the State sector Quality Assurance Council of the University Grants Commission takes in charge of the quality assurance activities in state universities through Internal Quality Assurance Units. However, there is no proper regulatory mechanism of quality assurance activities conducted in Non-State sector. As there is increase of student intake in the Non-State sector it is essential to implement quality assurance activities in every higher educational institute as the outcome is benefitted by the students.
Quality Assurance in higher education in Sri Lanka will face more difficulties and challenges, but will also face new opportunities. Strength and weakness co-exist; opportunity and threat go hand in hand. Based on the solid foundation and development of Quality Assurance Council of the University Grants Commission, together with all members, INQAAHE and APQN will work harder for our mission in quality in Higher education and sustainable development.

Cabinet nods to new labour act

The government received cabinet approval this week to introduce a new labour act which would integrate all current labour laws into one.
The Department of Labour has thus far implemented 61 Acts in relation to the labour force in the country but only 27 are being practically enforced.
Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister, Ravindra Samaraweera submitting a cabinet paper on the above subject noted that many of these laws had certain discrepancies in them and that the Department faced issues when enforcing them.
Thus a new law has been proposed with all safeguards towards current employee rights ensured.
The new Act would combine the Shop and Office Act, Wages Board Ordinance, Women, Young Persons and Children Employment Act and Maternity Benefits Ordinance into one.

Cancer drugs from Russia receives state approval

Two cancer drugs imported from Russia did not cause any adverse effects on patients and applications have been forwarded to register two more drugs, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne had said.
Minister Senaratne said that in the past a cancer drug was imported at a cost of Rs. 280,000 and after that another drug imported from Russia at a cost of Rs. 144,000 given to the hospitals.
The drug did not cause any adverse effects on patients. The same drug will be sold to a subsidized amount of Rs. 84,000.
Minister Senaratne also said that two more cancer drugs will be registered after processing the applications. The registration will be done by theNational Medicines Regulatory Authority (NMRA), the Minister said.
The Russian drug which was brought down to Sri Lanka was rejected by the Sri Lanka College of Oncologists (SLCO) in the first quarter of last year fearing of possible complications that can be developed in patients who use it as it was not commonly used around the world.

## Title: Captains Garden Kovil

Captains Garden Kovil
Its an iconic sight: the large gopuram of the Sri Kailawasanathan Swami Devasthanam Kovil towering above the train tracks in Maradana, greeting passengers as they travel to and from Colombo.
The temple, in its modern form, celebrates its 30th anniversary this year.
But the place of worship is actually much older. And few know the history of the citys oldest and largest temple to Shiva.
This temple was established by our community, the Chetti community, businessmen who came to Sri Lanka from India, said S. Mahendran Chettiyar, one of the kovils trustees, in a recent interview.
According to an old deed, a shrine to Shiva has existed at the current site since 1783, Mahendran said. But it could have started even before then, we cant say, he added.
Regardless, for more than two centuries, the kovil has been a place of worship for not just the Chetti community, but for Hindus from around Colombo and the region. Buddhists who want to make offerings to Lord Shiva or other gods at the temples surrounding smaller shrines, come here too.
Every year, the Defence Forces come to the kovil for poojas, the temples trustees said, and it is a common place for presidents and prime ministers to seek blessings. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe even came on a recent Friday evening, Mahendran said.
The story of just how a humble shrine grew into prominence is an interesting one.
Island temple
The Sri Kailawasanathan Kovil goes by many names, but they are all connected. Its official name refers to Mount Kailash, the mountain home of Lord Shiva in Hindu cosmology.
Colloquially, its called the Theevu Kovil in Tamil, meaning the island temple. Its also known by an English name, the Captains Garden Kovil.
In the past, the little rise of land the temple sits on used to be an island. Before Colombos wetlands were carved into canals and lakes, the area that now holds two corridors of train tracks was under water.
The small island was a place for sea captains to take rest, and N. Dharmaseelan Chettiyar, another temple trustee, said the Chetti community had set up some small shops there along with a shrine.
When the water was eventually diverted, and the British colonizers built train tracks in its place, the Shiva Temple remained.
Today, the temple grounds still feel like an island, sheltered from the traffic and noise of the city. Birds chirp in the surrounding trees, and devotional music wafts from the temples interior.
Apart from the occasional passing train, the kovil feels a world away from Colombo.
This is a very isolated place. Thats why people love to come, said Mahendran. They can pray peacefully.
The gopuram
Not much detail is known about the temples early days. The next major development in its history was in 1935, Dharmaseelan said, when the temple trustees decided to build a gopuram.
During that period my grandfather was on the board, he said.
But for lack of funds or manpower, it was never fully constructed. By 1988, it was only partially built. A new board of trustees convened, including Mahendran and Dharmaseelan, to finish the job.
But still it was not an easy task.
We couldnt finish itwe had a lot of problems, said Mahendran.
Because of the ongoing civil war, it was hard to secure visas for the dozen-or-so sculptors who needed to come from India to make the intricate statues that decorate the temples gopuram.
When they did come, one of them died. We had a lot of problems, Mahendran repeated.
They finally completed the gopuram in 1994. Its layers of delicately crafted, primary-coloured statues are now a Colombo landmark.
Last year, they renovated the smaller temple to Ganesh alongside the main one. Its gopuram stands today in bright gold, red, green, and blue, just below its larger neighbour.
The expanded temple complex now draws hundreds of devotees a week. Tourists often wander in for pictures.
The temple is undoubtedly a hefty centre of Colombos spiritual life.
The future
The days of the small shrine on an island are gone.
But as for the descendants of its founders, We still administrate the temple, Dharmaseelan said.
The five trustees of the Sri Kailawasanathan Swami Devasthanam Kovil meet every Saturday evening to plan events like the annual Mahotsavam festival and renovations to the temples interior and exterior.
Renovations must be made every 12 years, they said, to combat water damage, dirt, and fading paint. A 12-year timetable is also auspicious, because it aligns with the Hindu cosmic cycle.
But the current trustees cannot do the job forever. Dharmaseelan is now apprenticing his 30-year-old son Sudan in the ways of temple administration.
He said passing the responsibility through family is the best way to assure future leaders are devoted to the preservation of the temple. Because we know our children, he said.
Sudan grew up going to the kovil, learning the stories and ways to worship Lord Shiva and the gods.
His father Dharmaseelan and other mentor, Mahendran, told the story of Shiva and the hunter, which is beautifully depicted on the temples ceiling, as one of the greatest teachings of the religion.
As the story goes, there once was a forest shrine tended to by a devout Brahmin, who was a vegetarian and worshiped Shiva in all the correct ways. In the same forest, there was a hunter, who every day would offer part of his kill to the Shiva lingam at the shrine.
One day, to test the hunters devotion, Lord Shiva made one of his eyes on the lingam bleed. The hunter took out his own eye with an arrow and placed it over the lingams, and the bleeding stopped.
Then, the other eye started bleeding. The hunter, knowing he would be blind after taking out his second eye, placed his big toe on the spot to mark its place, and began removing his second eye. Shiva then restored the hunters vision in honour of his sacrifice.
The Brahmin, watching from afar, saw that it was true devotion that really mattered, not just the actions and orthodoxy of rituals.
This is the best story of Shiva, said Mahendran. Because it shows sacrifice, and love. Whatever I eat, I give to you.
The trustees hope the next generation will take care of the temple so that it can live on into the next centuries.
Asked if he will be a trustee his whole life, Sudan, Dharmaseelans son replied: We dont know.
But thats the idea, he added.

Case against Dr. Padeniya fixed for inquiry
The contempt of court case filed against Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement regarding the SAITM issue, was yesterday fixed for inquiry by the Court of Appeal.
Accordingly, Court of Appeal (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara fixed the matter for inquiry on September 28.
On December 6 last year, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the prelimina raised by Dr. Padeniya.
The Court of Appeal yesterday observed that there are sufficient materials to issue a rule against Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya in respect of a charge sheet filed against him over contemptuous statements.
On a previous occasion, a charge sheet was served on GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya by the Court of Appeal for allegedly undermining the Court of Appeal judgement dated January 31, 2017 which was delivered compelling the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) to register the MBBS graduates of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) provisionally as medical practitioners in terms of the Medical Ordinance.
However, Dr. Padeniya, through his lawyer, had informed the Court of Appeal that his client was not pleading guilty to the charge sheet when it was read out by the court stenographer.
The Court of Appeal had also issued an Interim Order (IO) preventing the GMOA President from making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the final determination of this contempt of court action.
Two civil society activists Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, the convener of National Movement for Social Justice (NMSJ) and Gamini Viyangoda, the co-convener of Puravesi Balaya Social Movement had filed this contempt of court action naming GMOA President Dr. Anuruddha Padeniya as the respondent.
The petitioners stated that upon the delivery of the said judgement by the Court of Appeal, the GMOA has condemned and openly criticised the said judgement demanding the annulment or setting aside of the said judgement.
The petitioners further stated that in this backdrop, the GMOA headed by Dr. Padeniya has called for a national front and trade union action against the SAITM following courts decision in ordering SAITM medical graduates to be registered with the SLMC.
The petitioners stated that on or about April 7, 2017, the GMOA had organised island-wide trade union action against the SAITM halting all health services including private practice and private health services to stress on the government to abolish the SAITM.
The petitioners stated that the contemptuous statements and comments demonstrate the blatant hatred of the respondent and publication of the same in the said speech indubitably disturbs the court process and hampers and undermines the authority of the Court of Appeal in respect of the administration of justice, especially in view of the fact that the said speech was published and telecast on several medias and has been uttered by the respondent in a public meeting held under the topic Abolish the SAITM on April 4, 2017.
The petitioners are pleading that Dr. Padeniya be charged on the offence of Contempt of Court of Appeal under Article 105 (3) of the Constitution of the Republic of Sri Lanka.
They are further seeking an Interim Order restraining and preventing the GMOA President from committing, making or publishing further contemptuous statements/articles scandalising the Court of Appeal until the conclusion of this case. They further urge to impose a sentence on the respondent as provided for in Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Upul Jayasuriya appeared for the petitioners. President's Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Ravindranath Dabare appeared for the respondent.

Dr. Palihawadana said all information about Leptospirosis and about the drug Doxycycline used to prevent it can be obtained by dialling the 0710107107 hot line.The service is free and available 24 hours with specialised doctors replying all inquiries.
Dr. Palihawadana said those vulnerable to the disease include farmers, persons who clean drains, persons who work in mines, marshy lands, canals and persons who swim or play in contaminated water.They should contact the nearest PHI or MOH office and obtain the Doxycycline dose issued free.They need to take two tablets before their work and need to also consume plenty of water while working.The tablets can give around 90% protection for one weeks period.Two tablets should be taken until work ends.
The main symptoms of rat fever are abrupt onset of high fever, mild flu, chills, conjunctival suffusion, muscle tenderness (notable in calf and lumber areas), intense headache, jaundice area and decrease in passing urine. It is vital to seek medical treatment as early as possible from a Government hospital.
Rat fever can be cured if medical treatment is given on time. It is however difficult to save the life of a patient who seeks medical treatment at the latter stage where renal, heart failure and other symptoms appear, Dr. Palihawadana said.

Withholding Tax on Treasury Bills and REPOS
These days income taxpayers who have invested in TBs and Repos are confused and taken aback by the intended new Tax Laws pertaining to the above-mentioned subject for 2018/19.
TBs and Repos are investments made with the Central Bank. Up to 2018/19, the WHT on these were paid at source by the Primary Dealer who is generally a Bank. The investor received the interest (albeit a little lower compared to a Fixed Deposit) without having to pay any tax. In other words, TBs/Repos were tax-free investments.
The investors were confident that their monies were safe. The Central Bank, in turn, filled up the coffers by getting the WHT from the Primary Dealers, who are immensely wealthy as everyone knows.
In 2018/19 this particular Tax Law has given a tax holiday to the Primary Dealers (who are making hand over first anyway) and burdened the investor. Therefore most of the investors of TBs/Repos (which are issued by the Central Bank) have started pulling out their monies to invest in Fixed Deposits, which give a better deal at the moment. The Central Bank is the loser.
Whoever who drafted this WHT Law has acted inimically towards the present Government, depriving it of TBs/Repos, and also disenchanting it with the people, all in one fell blow.
Before gazetting this Tax Law, the Government still has time to revert to the former method of collecting WHT from the Primary Dealers. This will not only give redress to the investors but stem the outward flow of monies from the Central Bank, while also keeping a hold on the goodwill of the people.
Another point is that the Tax Department wants the investor to project the interest-income of TBs/Repos, which is ludicrous. How can a person today, predict the interest earned on an investment, up to March 31, 2019 In this period, the capital may be withdrawn or enhanced. The interest rate can fluctuate. If more taxes are needed for 2018/19, it should be collected from 2017/18 by a Law with retrospective effect. However unfair to the taxpayer, at least correct amounts can be calculated because of accurate data available.
Someone who is neither conversant in Accountancy nor wanting to keep the good name of this Government has framed this WHT Law. I hope the President and the Prime Minister will look into this matter quickly. The soaring cost of living and the hardship due to extreme weather have already reduced the goodwill of the citizens towards the Government.
No one educated in Tax Laws (in Banks or the Tax Department) is competent enough to advice the public whether the Balance Interest Income (after the exemption of 1.5 million) is to be taxed at 5% only, or whether it will be added to the tax slab of the rest of the income, of the taxpayer.
What a pathetic situation.

Colombo city to go green under new programme
Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake yesterday pledged to transform the Colombo city into a blue- green city with a 1000 percent expansion of the tree cover.
The Mayor was speaking at the launch of Green City Project organised by Colombo Municipal Council at Viharamahadevi park in parallel with the World Environment Day celebrations.
She said that this task will be carried out by Environmental Committees functioning under 107 Municipal Councillors and with the support of Colombo city residents and private and state institutions. According to this programme, trees will be planted in parks and pavements in a scientific manner to withstand against adverse weather, climatic and high temperature conditions.
"Colombo is no more green city now as we experienced during our childhood. It is now a concrete jungle. Therefore, we will do maximum to make Colombo city as a blue-green city in the coming years through the CMC environmental committees.
"Our ancestors had planted trees in a scientific manner after considering many factors including climate conditions, temperature, soil, wind directions among others.
CMC Environment Committee Chairman Pradeep Jayawardene said technology will be utilized for a census on the number of trees in the Colombo city.The proposed census will be carried out with support from the Colombo and Moratuwa Universities which will be used as a database to check value and other important details of existing trees in the city. For the first time we have used digital technology to identify and take census of the burutha plantation in the Viharamaha Devi park.

Colombo to host International  Housekeepers Summit in July
In a major initiative taken by housekeepers across Asia, the International Housekeepers Summit that was launched in 2016, has today become Asias largest convention of hospitality housekeeping professionals who will be converging in Colombo from over 15 countries.
Following the two successful Summits at Mumbai, the third International Housekeepers Summit is being held at Colombo from July 3 to 4 in keeping with the growing hospitality segment in Sri Lanka and the rising demand for quality services with 100% occupancy.
The Ministry of Tourism announced the support to the third International Housekeepers Summit at the press conference hosted by Shangri-La Hotel on Monday.
The Ministry of Tourism, Sri Lanka, has extended support and blessings to the Summit, in appreciation of the initiative of the housekeepers. Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunga, in a statement issued following the support, has said that, Sri Lanka considers it a great honour to welcome the delegates attending the 3rd International Housekeepers Summit.
Representing Minister John Amaratunga at the press conference, Senior Advisor Felix Srimal Rodrigo, Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, said, I am happy to know that the Asian Housekeepers are organising the International Housekeepers Summit and this is the way forward and the first step. Such events will give more and more recognition to housekeeping department. On behalf of the minister I wish you all a great success.
Elaborating the need for such conferences, he added, Housekeeping is one department that requires a lot of consistency. Today, the rooms are having a very fast turnaround time during high occupancy. Especially in international hotels, housekeeping gets only a few hours to clean the room. The housekeeper, assistant housekeeper or supervisor do not get incentives and yet have to produce a perfect room with clean linen, services, decoration. Housekeepers play a vital role but unfortunately, they are not recognised like the food and beverage manager or the chef.
Welcoming the chief guest, Timothy Wright, Vice President and General Manager of Shangri-La Hotels, said, The International Housekeepers Summit is a great opportunity for hoteliers and for professionals to meet experts and fellow professionals and learn the new trends & technology available in this industry.
Presented by the Asian Housekeepers Association, a conglomerate of housekeeping associations from 11 countriesthe International Housekeepers Summit aims are redefining housekeeping in the corporate strategy.
The Association members include i-Professional Housekeepers Association, India; Maldives Housekeepers Forum; Sri Lanka Housekeepers Association; Professional Housekeepers Group, UAE; Doha Housekeepers Group; Kuwait Housekeepers Hub; Saudi Arabia Housekeepers Association; Malaysian Association of Housekeepers; Vietnam Executive Housekeeper Association and Indonesian Housekeepers Association.
These associations form the Asian Housekeepers Association headquartered at Mumbai, India.
Based on the theme- Rekindling Foundations of Housekeeping, Linen Care and Customer Services, the two-day summit has incorporated sessions as diverse as training, technology, laundry, management, servicing and purchase. Gaining insights into newer approaches to the essentials of housekeeping with significant hearings from experts, the sessions have been woven together with relevant aspects in an interactive format.
The summit also includes a Buyer-Seller meet to enable business interactions with all the delegates. As in the past there is a unique fashion show showcasing hospitality attire by leading uniform designers. IHS2018 will also conduct the 2nd Edition of the Asian Housekeeping Awards which honours the Best Housekeeper in Asia from among the entries received.
The International Housekeepers Summit is organised by Virtual Info Systems Pvt. Ltd, India; and presented by Asian Housekeepers Association.

## Title: In defence of the Tuks
## Supertitle:

In defence of the Tuks

Tuk tuks, or trishaws as theyre sometimes called, are ubiquitous across South Asia. Sri Lanka specifically is home to over 1.2 million of the three-wheeler vehiclesthats more than one tuk for every twenty people on the island. But lately, on the streets of Colombo, theyve been given a bad name.
The reason An increase in incidents involving tuk tuk drivers in the Colombo area inappropriately touching female passengers. At least that is the opinion of the U.S. Embassy in Colombo, which put out a security message on June 26th urging its female citizens travelling here to avoid riding in tuk tuks alone, and offering suggestions to prevent similar incidents.
But the incidents" in question are hard to pin down. According to Police Media Spokesman Ruwan Gunasekara, there were only four incidents reported against tuk tuk drivers island-wide in 2016: one sexual assault, one sexual harassment, and two incidents of cheating on the meter. So far in 2017, only three incidents have been reported island-wide: one sexual harassment and two incidents of cheating on the meter. All these tuk tuk drivers were arrested and tried, said Gunasakara.
When asked for an explanation of the incidents referred to in the embassy statement, or for the data behind the decision to release such a statement, the U.S. embassy refused to comment. Instead, a spokesperson simply reiterated that the warning was aimed only at American women in Colombo.
Yet the decision to warn against an entire industry because of the actions of a few, even if the intended audience was limited, is already having grave consequences for the tuk tuk drivers.
Mohammed Ibrahim, a forty-two-year-old father of four children, has driven a tuk tuk for twenty years. But, he said, since the U.S. embassy posted its warning last week, business has been slow. His routine for the past five years has been to wait for potential passengers outside of the Fort Railway Stationnow more than ever before, people just walk by him.
All these words, he said, referring to the embassys warning and the news articles publicizing it, theyre no good. He explained that many tuk tuk drivers like him are poor, and if theres a problem, its less than one percent of drivers (with a problem). But because of this warning, even the good drivers are losing business.
There is also the potential for the embassys warning to affect Sri Lankas growing tourism industry, said Tourism Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa. He emphasized that while there may have been some isolated incidents which we are not denying, by and large we dont agree with the embassy on this warning. He concluded that inasmuch as these incidents have presented themselves, the Tourism Ministry has been doing all it can to address them, such as arranging various training programmes for tuk tuk drivers throughout different provinces on how best to interact with foreigners.
Of course, this is not to say that the incidents, few and far between as they may be, arent problematic. Any situation in which a persons safety is at risk should be taken seriously and treated with the utmost caution. And both foreign and local Sri Lankan women did express some concerns similar to those outlined by the U.S. embassys message. However, most of the women we spoke to felt the embassys message either went too far or omitted what they view as more helpful advice.
For instance, of the security tips provided by the embassy, the first is: Females should avoid travelling in tuk-tuks alone in Colombo. Yet most women have explained that while they may refrain from taking tuk tuks alone at night, almost all feel safe taking them during the dayan important distinction which the embassys message didnt make. A group of four Sri Lankan female students studying at international universities, all aged 20-21, said that even though some of their parents were strongly opposed to them using tuk tuks at night, they were all fine with the use of tuk tuks by their daughters during the day.
As well, another security tip provided by the embassyUse a company that tracks your ride rather than tuk tuks...fails to acknowledge that there are specific ride-hailing applications in Colombo which track rides for tuk tuks, such as PickMe, and therefore address this very issue.
This omission is significant, since almost every woman we spoke to said they would feel comfortable alone in a tuk tuk, not just during the day but at night, too, so long as it was hailed through PickMe.
Malsha Perera, a student at the University of Sri Jayewardenepura, said that while she might be hesitant to ride tuk tuks at night in general, she feels safe and protected when she uses PickMe (which has an SOS button within the app for any security concerns) at any time, because it is done by GPS through a reputable company that has established confidence in its customers.
At issue for many hesitant to use tuk tuks seems to be the lack of regulations governing the vehicles. But as Perera hinted at, applications like PickMe have, in their own ways, taken the regulating of tuk tuks into their own hands, making the option of a tuk tuk ride an even safer one.
Portia Ratnayake, the Vice President of Communications for PickMe, said the company has gone to great lengths to ensure the safety of its passengers in tuk tuks, both during the ride itself and before the ride ever takes place. During the ride, said Ratnayake, the apps interface contains features such as the aforementioned SOS signalling, in addition to ETA (estimated time of arrival) sharing, which allows passengers to share a live feed of their trip with friends and family.
And long before the ride even begins, every potential tuk tuk driver is thoroughly vetted. In Ratnayakes own words, We require extensive documentation from the driver and vehicle owner upon registering with our service. This includes a police report and GM report (grama seveka certificate) along with multiple billing proof and documents that support the identity of the person registering with us. Finally, PickMe also conducts in-person interviews with every tuk tuk driver before hiring them.
So perhaps more factors should have been weighedsuch as the potential for harming the livelihood of tuk tuk drivers and Sri Lankas tourism industry, as well as the role of ride-hailing apps in making tuk tuk travel more safebefore such a message was released by the U.S. Embassy. At the end of the day, any mode of transportation carries some risks. But it would seem that too broad a stroke was painted when characterizing tuk tuks in general as unsafe for American women.
As a twenty-five-year-old unmarried female resident of Dehiwala put it, If there is a serious security concern, the U.S. embassy should deal with it in a more nuanced way. But issuing a blanket warning is a major overreaction and is seriously damaging to the country.

Democracy, then and now
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera says that the Sri Lankan public should credit this government 100 per cent for creating a mature democracy in this country on par with other advanced democracies in the west such as the USA. Launching the Sathya (Truth) campaign and the UNP media unit at Sirikotha on Monday, the minister also said that certain facets of the government has been construed by the public as being due to its weakness but added that on the contrary these aspects stand testimony to the fact that Sri Lanka is a mature democracy. He said despite many persons criticizing the government for being weak, the same traits they identify as weaknesses are the characteristics of a mature democracy.
The minister, of course, was referring to the spate of strikes, protests and agitations and the non-action on the part of the government to suppress these campaigns. He said there is freedom to hold public protests like in any democratic country. He also noted that during the last three and a half years two Cabinet ministers stepped down from their posts and the Prime Minister was summoned to give evidence before a Presidential Commission, while a No Confidence Motion too was brought against the PM, for good measure. This is what democracy is all about, the Minister went onto stress.
Minister Samaraweera is right when he said that the public perception of the government was a negative one due to its failure to deploy harsh methods to restore order. In other words, they fault the government for its failure to use a heavy hand in dealing with the various sabotage and disruptive campaigns that affect public life. For instance, government doctors go on strike advocating causes that are far removed from their profession, causing misery and hardship to the public while the government appears helpless. Naturally, public anger wells up and is directed at the government.
But the fact remains that such protests and disruptive action, politically motivated as they are, are being tolerated. In other words Trade Union action and the right to strike are being recognized in the true democratic spirit, by the government. The media too is enjoying untrammeled freedom to a level that may make one wonder if this was a government under siege.
Here too the US parallel drawn by the minister is appropriate, considering the unrelenting attacks news channels such as the CNN carry out targeting US President Donald Trump. Even its worst critic would concede that this government permitted media freedom as no government before this has done. One could say that it has virtually allowed itself to be persecuted by the private media. A far cry from the days when media houses were bombed and journalists murdered or made to disappear.
Of course, Minister Samaraweera's whole intention was to compare the state of play in the present day with that of the Rajapaksa era. One should not lose sight of the fact that the regime change on January 8 was as much to do with anti-democratic acts of the Rajapaksas as with the allegations of mega corruption. The right to criticize is an important facet in a true democracy. So is the right to hold independent views and the right to dissent. The collective public memory cannot be all that short to forget how the Rajapaksas acted in this respect.
The country's first lady Chief Justice was hounded out following a sham trial by a so called Parliament Select Committee for ruling against a move by a powerful Rajapaksa sibling cum minister to use public funds outside the sanction of parliament. On the other hand, the Deputy Prime Minister of Australia was forced to step down after a court ruled that he could not hold office due to his dual citizenship. It was also the Supreme Court of Pakistan which ousted Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif after he was found guilty of corruption. Under the Yahapalanaya Government the judiciary was granted total independence, so much so the Supreme Court even deemed that the President's term will end in 2020 and not one year later, when he (President) sought a ruling in this connection, another facet of a true democracy where the concept of separation of powers was adhered to the letter.
As to the people's rights, protesters demanding clean drinking water were shot at resulting in the death of two innocent by-standers. Not only that, the people's right to free movement was obstructed when large areas of the Colombo Fort area were sealed off, so that the Rajapaksa progeny could indulge in their favourite pastime of car racing. The freedom to engage in political activity was denied when supporters of the UNP were set upon by government sponsored goons, resulting in injuries to many. The Common Candidate was deprived of venues to hold his meetings during the Presidential Election campaigns and in fact one of the stages was set on fire.
In contrast, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe threw open the Galle Face Green for Mahinda Rajapaksa to hold his May Day rally while the recent Local Government Election was one of the freest held in this country, as it should be in a mature democracy.

Drug addicts reintegrated into society
The Bureau of the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation held a reintegration ceremony for rehabilitated drug addicts, at the Tertiary and Vocational Literature Training Centre, Senapura, Welikanda, on June 1.
Fifty-one beneficiaries were reintegrated into society after a one-year period of rehabilitation and were handed over to their next of kin. They had been convicted for drug abuse and sent for treatment at the Rehabilitation Centre, Kandakadu, through a court order.
The Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake told the Daily News that during the first six months, the drug addicts undergo various therapies including counseling, meditation, agro therapy, music therapy and leadership programmes, at the Kandakadu facility.
During the next six months, they are given vocational training, which is useful in improving their livelihood opportunities after reintegration. The participants are trained in welding, plumbing, carpentry, masonry, electrical wiring, computer programmes, etc., at the Senapura facility.
The training programme is conducted under the supervision and guidance of Minister D.M. Swaminathan and Secretary of the Ministry Dr. Ponnaiah Suresh. Upon completion of the vocational training programme, they are awarded the NVQ Level 111 Certificate, which is well recognised and is a great advantage in gaining employment.
The Commissioner General said that currently, only males above 18 are sent to the rehabilitation centre for training, through court orders. However, Cabinet approval has been obtained to accept others who would like to join the programme voluntarily and for the inclusion of males and females over 18 who join voluntarily and through court orders.
Plans are currently being made to accept around 3,000 persons for the drug rehabilitation programme with 1,500 at Kandakadu and another 1,500 at Senapura. However, we have a few infrastructure problems that we have to overcome and once this is sorted out, we could commence this programme. We require more land to accommodate this number, which is currently being looked into, he said.
Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Major General Janaka Ratnayake graced the occasion as chief guest. Deputy Commissioner General of Rehabilitation Brigadier Darshana Liyanage, Rev. Sr. Mary Canice and other officials as well as family members of the beneficiaries and staff members also participated.

Gift for Sai Baba  devotees
For the first time in the world, an abridged version of the book Sai Sat Charithram has been translated in Sinhala and being released on 10th of June 2018 by Sai Nathanin Saranalayam a Shirdi Sai temple located in Kotahena, Colombo.
Sai Sat Charithra is considered as the holiest book of Sai devotees. The book describes the life history and teachings of Sai Baba in simple terms.
It is believed that those who read the book with complete faith in Baba are relieved of their troubles and bad karmas not only from this birth but also from previous and future births.
Shirdi Sai movement is spreading fast across the world and Sri Lanka is no exemption to this. Sai Baba appeared from nowhere at the age of 16 under a neem tree in a small village called Shirdiin Maharastra, India.
He showered unconditional love on people not only from Shirdi but also on all who sought his help. Like the Buddha, he was so humble and was free of any ego that he had no hesitation in begging food from others. He shared whatever he received with those in need.
He blessed his devotees with unlimited miracles and happiness in their lives. He promised that he would answer the calls of devotees even after leaving his physical form. He is sticking to his wards till date.
A temple for Shirdi Sai Baba in the name of Sai Nathanin Saranalayam was set up under unplanned circumstances in the first floor of Iyngaran Hall at Sri Varadaraja Vinayagar Temple, Kotahena, and Colombo in April 2017.
Within a year of inception, Sai Baba in this temple has blessed a lot of devotees with peace prosperity and several miraculous experiences.
With his grace, several spiritual events have also been conducted, attracting flocks of devotees from all over Sri Lanka.
He has also brought in several spiritual gurus and devotees from India and abroad for discourses.
The trustees of Sai Nathanin Saranalayam are now releasing this Sinhala book, an abridged version of
Shirdi Sai Sat Charithra, in order for our Sinhalese sisters and brothers to get to know Sai Baba and experience his abundant love. The trustees invite the public to attend the ceremony and get Babas blessings.

Rugby legend comes out with Risk management and safety strategy
Hafeez Marsos plan to curb unruly behaviour at schools rugby
Former Police Sports Club triple champion winning 1989 rugby captain, Sri Lanka double international (Basketball and Rugby) legendary sportsmen cum former DIG Hafeez Marso has comes out with Risk Management and Safety Strategy to prevent untoward incidents happening at schools rugby matches. Speaking exclusively to the Daily News in an interview he said,
PREAMBLE
The dire need to devise a viable mechanism is inevitable to arrest the recent untoward incidents that occurred during a few school rugby encounters. Though it could be summed up the near contributory factors for such incidents to ignite; this is not the time to point fingers at anyone. In the interest of school rugby which is the future of national rugby; the way forward is to think anew how best the prevailing issues could be sorted out with the concerted effort of all stake holders.
RUGBY TRADITIONS
It is considered pertinent to reflect on the history of rugby to give some insights that paved the way for the gentlemans game to flourish in the island nation. Rugby is a physical contact game which goes back to over 12 decades ever since it was introduced in 1895 and now played by over 100 countries with a player base of 5.3 million both registered and unregistered, according to the latest statistics. Almost all the founder member unions (countries) still uphold the great traditions of the game at all levels with respect to each other in whatever role they are involved, even the spectators; and such precept had always kept the game of rugby clean with no or very minimal hooliganism. Suffice to say that Sri Lanka with a history of over 100 years of rugby inherited and practiced those customs left by our pioneers and the stalwarts of yesteryear.
CONTRIBUTORY FACTORS
The few recent unfortunate incidents witnessed at the school rugby matches may be attributed to lack of awareness of the traditions practiced in the distant past and due to omissions or commissions on the part of some of the stake holders which may have been perceived by the concerned parties to be controversial; and this is often seen as a point of ignition to cause unruly behaviour when emotions run high intertwined with provocative remarks and gestures that invariably aggravate the situation finally ending up in fisticuffs.
The schools certainly may have its genuine grievances over some of the issues that need to be addressed by all the stake holders. In fairness, the schools expect something tangible in return for the colossal amount of funds they spent on rugby. Having said so, the unruly behaviour of the crowd to whichever team they belong to, cannot be condoned.
ZERO TOLERANCE AND THE WAY FORWARD
Depending on physical security to prevent incidents is only a temporary remedy; instead, the mindset should work to bring about a Paradigm Shift creating a more conducive culture. Ignorance or complacency to resolve the issue may precipitate to more serious consequences though it may appear for the time being that things have subsided as a result of some knee-jerk action.
At this precise juncture, all the stake holders namely, the Sri Lanka Rugby, Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association, Sri Lanka Society of Rugby Football Referees, other Match Officials (Match and Citing Commissioners), Judicial Officers, Disciplinary Committee, the Principals/Wardens and its Rugby Management including the Old Boys Unions, Coaches, Team Managers and their Supporting Staff need to work as a team with utmost coordination helping one and other; and such a mechanism would make things much easier towards achieving success.
In this endeavour, the stake holders should not be pressed to compromise their status-co but they should try to adapt to a collective workable approach. In similar vein, it wouldnt be an unwise move for the school authorities to reach out to the former players and rugby administrators of repute to seek their services and expertise.
While the order of the day would be to Keep Rugby Clean and Fair with Zero Tolerance; the need of the hour would be to exercise self-restrain and not let emotions to dictate terms and leave it to the law to take its due course.
Marsos Proposed Mechanism point by point is as follows,
1. Pro - Active Measure

Hagiography  of a different halo
If I remember correct, Most Venerable Balangoda Ananda Maitreya Thera ushered in a new era of Dhamma education in our country commencing as far back as 1940s. The learned monk who knew several oriental languages compiled two main textbooks: Buddha Charitaya and Saddharma Chandrikava for the benefit of the Dhamma teachers and pupils.
As time passed by, the Venerable Thera was engaged in the function of translating more Pali Tripitaka books with prefaces which went into the making of the Buddha Jayanthi Tripitaka Mala books that are in use today. The collection of about seven books that went into the making of a magnum opus titled Shakya Munindravansaya Hevat Siddhartha Buddha Charitya came to be the culmination of the writings.
Blissful plane
This book came to light as far back as 1960s with a resourceful preface, enlightening the reader on the value of a great biography of a great being who helped the common masses to elevate from the suffering to a blissful plane of summum bonum or a supreme state of Nibbana. The work is now available in translation thanks to Samayawardhana Publishers and the Translator, Dr W A Abeysinghe.
The English translation titled Gautama Buddha contains 50 chapters, packed with all the remarkable factors that go into the making of a resourceful biography of Siddhartha Gautama who later became known as the Enlightened One, the Buddha. Though there are more than 100 works written on the theme of the life of the Buddha, compiled by several learned scholars such as Rhys Davids, a comparison of the qualities of learning of others with those of Siddhartha. The sensitive factors that led the Prince Siddhartha to renounce the worldly life despite all the luxuries of the palacious living conditions. The cultural vision and mission to the realisation of the sensuous life as against the achievement of the higher state of mental peace and serenity.
The difficulties encountered in the achievement of the noble state of mindfulness, defeating the barriers brought about by Mara etc brought the deliverance of the first sermon to the formation of the order of monks.
Various types of tales, anecdotes linked to the doctrine of the Buddha are enclosed. Examples drawn from the past births too follow.
Eternal thought
A comparison between the Dhamma of the Buddha and those other contemporary teachers such as Niganthanataputta are laid down. This leads to an eternal thought pattern of insight into the blissful teachings of the Buddha and the places visited by the Buddha and how they eventually became sanctified places of worship that remain up to date. How the teachings came to be passed down the years orally.
The ways and means of bringing reconciliation between rival parties on the part of the Buddha. The challenges or rivalry faced by the Buddha and how they were brought into amicable settlements and a truce.
The formation of the order of nuns in keeping with the accepted norms of ethics. The setting of daily agenda in the life of the Buddha which remains as a memorandum forever.
Dr Abeysinghe is a painstaking writer who has not left behind most other available original sources for his function. He has utilised the English works of the Pali Text Society for his translation. As such, the present work titled Gautama Buddha will inevitably laid at a higher level of contribution to the Buddhist literature.
The preface written by the original author Venerable Ananda Maitreya Thera lays down a very important factor that goes as follows:
For the expression of mans thoughts and feelings books came to existence from almost the times immemorial at the beginning they took the oral form and the scripts came into being, they took the written form with the advent of the printing process books abounded the human civilisation. Books on religions, history, astrology, medicine and various other disciplines came to be written as a result of which libraries became the repositories of learning.
Multi-faceted spectrum
This vision stands as a prologue to the present work both in form and content. As a reader, I felt that there is not a single episode in the life of the Buddha, left behind. The work cannot be merely discerned as a biography instead as a multi-faceted spectrum of wisdom. As visualised by the great linguist and thinker Ludwig Wittgenstein, the Australian scholar. A great biography is not merely the linking of factors and episodes linked to the protagonist concerned. It is also a transcend from the mundane social factors to a spiritual plane.
All in all, the work Gautama Buddha ought to a volume that should reach all the bliraries around the world especially in the English-reading countries, desite the geographical, social, political and religious barriers. A commendable effort and a tribute to knowledge acquisition.

Historic series win beckons if Lanka plays its cards right
Sri Lankas fourth visit to the Caribbean in 36 years as a Test-playing nation gives them a golden opportunity to record a historic maiden Test series win provided they play their cards right.
This current tour comes after a decade, the last tour having taken place in 2008 when Sri Lanka recorded their maiden Test win on Caribbean soil. God knows when the next tour to the calypso islands will be. By that time Sri Lanka will be without most of their stalwarts who would probably be retired by then.
Why we say this tour is the best chance to win a Test series in the West Indies is because Rangana Herath, who has figured in several famous Test wins for his country since the retirement of the great Muthiah Muralitharan in 2008 is now on his last legs. At 40 he is not getting any younger and with his dodgy knees this Caribbean tour will certainly be his last, and what better way than to bowl his country to a memorable series win.
The same goes with former captain Angelo Mathews. Although age is on his side (he is 31) his fitness has been of great concern to the national team. Like Herath, Mathews is also being monitored carefully and may not play the full three Tests against the West Indies although he is in the side purely as a batsman.
Needless to say Herath and Mathews are the two most experienced cricketers in the side their combined number of Tests totaling 161 which is only 37 Tests less than the rest of the squad put together.
West Indies cricket are not in a healthy state at the moment especially their Test team with iconic players like Chris Gayle, Dwayne Bravo, Kieron Pollard, Andre Russell having abandoned the established game for the fast bucks earned from lucrative T20 cricket around the world that has left their Test cricket the poorer so much so that they have sunk to ninth out of ten teams in the ICC Test Rankings.
West Indies cricket was not so badly placed when Sri Lanka toured there in 1997 and in 2003 with legendary batsman Brian Lara holding the fast sinking ship together with his extraordinary batting talent. In 1997 Sri Lanka lost the Test to West Indies by six wickets at St Johns Antigua with the batting crumbling to the pace of Curtly Ambrose who finished with eight wickets. Six years later it was another fast bowler Corey Collymore who destroyed the Lankan batting at Jamaica also with an eight-wicket match haul that included 7/57 in the second innings. But with Lara gone by 2008, Sri Lanka was able to make inroads into the once unbreakable fortress by winning a Test match on Caribbean soil when Mahela Jayawardenes men turned tables on them at Providence, Guyana winning by 121 runs. Chaminda Vaas was the match winner running through the Windies batting with a bag of eight wickets. West Indies however hit back to level the series by winning the second Test.
The situation has not improved since then as West Indies current Test standing indicates but only sunk further which is why Sri Lanka stands a great chance to capitalize on this opportunity. It is easier said than done. One cannot write off the West Indies just because they are ranked low because at home they are quite a different proposition. Three years ago at Bridgetown  venue of the third Test against Sri Lanka (day-night)  West Indies stunned England with a five-wicket win to draw the three-Test series one-all. Mind you the England team captained by Alastair Cook comprised current players like James Anderson, Stuart Broad, Joe Root, Jos Buttler, Ben Stokes and Moeen Ali. Of the current West Indies Test squad named for the series against Sri Lanka skipper Jason Holder, Kraigg Brathwaite, Shannon Gabriel and Shai Hope are members of the team that beat England under wicket-keeper Denesh Ramdins leadership.
Last year although West Indies lost the three-Test series 2-1 to Pakistan, they managed to pull off a 106-run win at Bridgetown. Top performers for West Indies were Roston Chase (131), Shai Hope (90) and Shannon Gabriel (nine wickets). The West Indies strength in their bowling is pace with Gabriel, Kemar Roach, Miguel Cummins and Jason Holder spearing the attack with Devendra Bishoo being the solitary spinner. If the Lankan batters can counter this bowling and come up with challenging totals, they are not short of bowlers to win Test matches. Barring a 2-0 series defeat in India, Sri Lanka has had success in UAE (beating Pakistan 2-0) and in Bangladesh (winning 1-0) in their last three Test outings. A series win in the Caribbean would certainly improve their Test rankings from the current sixth  a position that is far better than in the other two shorter formats where they are ranked 8th and 9th.

HNB marks World Environment Day  with Green Pledge
HNB, Sri Lankas premier private sector bank, will mark United Nations World Environment Day by recommitting to the HNB Green Pledgea promise by every HNB employee to factor in environmental standards and consciousness into their days work and office environment.
HNB encourages teams to take one green step by pledging to make environmentally friendly change and record their progress. Having first committed to the Green Pledge 10 years ago, the Bank has evolved in its eco-conscious journey, within the office and branches as well as in communities that they operate in.
From the Banks award winning green buildings, symbols of the future of built-in technology to creating renewable energy at branches; from reducing carbon footprint through paperless operations to taking head-on the pollution issue at Sri Pada (Adams Peak), HNBs Green Pledge has become the pivotal focus of corporate governance. Part of the environmental consciousness is the endeavor of financing select projects that fit within this mantra.
HNBs Head of HR, Chiranthi Cooray said As Sri Lankans, we have had the privilege of being heirs to a priceless cultural and environmental legacy and we are pleased to be associated with positive initiatives which serve to preserve and enhance this legacy for future generations.
One such initiative, taken up by our staff, is to create awareness for a cleaner environment. HNB has been in the fore front of clean-up projects over the past few years, like beach cleaning and cleaning of the sacred peak, Sri Pada, she noted.
Using their historic legacy of a Bank that started business in Hatton in 1888, this year, HNB commenced their clean Sri Pada project from that very location.
Throughout the campaign, staff had the opportunity to observe and appreciate nature, participated in some wild life photography and took time to study the various fauna and flora along the route. During the event banners were strung to remind pilgrims of the hazards of polythene while waste collection bags were distributed to them, reminding them again the negative consequences of littering.
We at HNB are proud to do our bit in a range of initiatives that will help reduce the impact on the environment and help preserve natural resources. The actions and decisions of colleagues help achieve these aims and World Environment Day highlights this shared responsibility, summed up Cooray.

House on  wheels for party lovers
A tiny house has been designed just for people who like to party. The teeny 107,000 house comes on wheels and features a wet bar and a large garage door wall which opens up to make room for party guests.
It also includes a spacious kitchen and living area, luxurious bathrooms and a large bedroom flooded with natural light.
The home is 32-foot-long, eight-foot-six-inches-wide and 13-foot-six-inches tall.
Its built on a 30-foot-long triple-axle trailer, so that it can be towed virtually anywhere  including the beach.
Its made using recycled steel and has a cool butterfly roof, giving it a rustic look.
The Breezeway home was built by Tiny Heirloom for a private client and it was strategically designed just for socialising.
This home was designed for outdoor entertainment in good ol Texas, they said.
Outfitted with an in-house Bose sound system, a wet bar, and a spacious full kitchen making hospitality a breeze. The large garage door opens up to bring the outdoors in and vice versa on those days where its just too nice to shut out the outdoors. Most tiny homes dont factor in the need for social space, but the Breezeways interior design was left relatively empty to create a flexible area.
A handcrafted built-in dog kennel just to the side of the garage door allows our client to keep their pup close by and secure when needed. Reclaimed barn wood lines the kitchen walls with LED accent strips behind wine racks add a rustic yet sophisticated element to the design, the spokesperson for Tiny Heirloom continued.
With a linear actuator TV lift and touch activated storage door openers this home makes you feel ahead of time. A secondary swivel TV in the master loft provides great viewing from the comfort of your bed or from the kitchen below.
The master bath suite is one of our most luxurious to date. With marble styled walls, fully tiled shower, and half glass entrance it appeals to all the senses and its attention to detail can only truly be felt when you step inside for the first time. Topped off with storage and a washer and dryer combo this bath suite has it all.

## Title: Implementation of the Liberal Reform Programme

Implementation of the Liberal Reform Programme
All the signs are that the 2015 liberal political programme that was spearheaded by a broad coalition of social and political forces cutting across various divisions in society is disintegrating fast and the aspirations of a large majority of people in the country will remain unfulfilled or worse.
The newly elected government could not get its act together and embark upon a clear and coordinated programme of economic, political and social renewal due to both economic challenges arising from accumulated debts and political disunity within. Misdirected populist measures like salary hikes for government servants, sudden removal of chemical fertiliser subsidy without giving the farmers a viable alternative, wasting money on useless projects under the guidance of close political associates rather than genuine experts, continued foreign borrowings for unnecessary projects like express ways, etc. made the economic situation worse.
Another major reason for the emergence of the volatile political situation is the regrouping of interest groups and ideological forces opposed to political and social reforms both within and outside the government.
As for interest groups opposed to reforms, it is necessary to recognise the fact that the elaborate patron-client political system that existed prior to 2015 created a massive political constituency cutting across different strata and segments of society that remained loyal to the regime either due to ideological inclinations or naked self interest or both. With such an elaborate political network, the then leaders did not feel the need to introduce progressive reforms in any sector. To give a few examples: state institutions were not revamped to serve the public or address issues that came under their purview but were politicised to accommodate political supporters and diverse interest groups. This was done even within the university system to a considerable extent. Public resources were used to build up the patron client network rather than to cater to the needs of the people on an equitable basis. Even law enforcement agencies were micromanaged to serve sectarian interests rather than to enforce the law and deliver justice to citizens on the basis of the equality principle.
New approach to governance
Corruption of unprecedented scale was allowed to spread across society at all levels so that some people in the political network could amass wealth. The resulting sense of injustice, immorality and insecurity felt by an increasing proportion of the population belonging to all communities prepared the ground for the emergence of the broad coalition against the previous regime mentioned above. The need of the hour was to adopt a new approach to governance based on widely accepted principles of good governance and modern social values of equality of opportunity, justice and tolerance of diversity.
Yet, the developments over the last three years has demonstrated clearly that the new regime has largely failed to live up to public expectations and frustrated many people who were committed to the liberal democratic project. Even though the persisting issues such as growing income inequality, rural urban disparities, tensions between ethnic groups and rapid increase in private consumption, often at the expense of public consumption necessitated the new regime to go beyond liberalism and embrace social democratic policies, the balance sheet over the last three years shows that adequate measures were not taken to drive the country forward in the above direction. While one of the biggest issues during the last regime was the blatant politicisation of almost all public institutions, under the new regime also, many top appointments to important institutions were made on the basis of political and personal loyalties.
A reliable and credible system to identify, scrutinise and appoint competent persons to head important state institutions should have been put in place at the beginning. As a result, some institutions have already been ruined.
Many examples can be given to illustrate the main point mentioned above, namely, the new government perpetuated many poor governance practices that the people rejected at the last presidential election.
Anti-Muslim attacks
As is well known, minority communities contributed a great deal to the electoral triumph of the present regime in 2015. Yet, the leaders of the government failed to reassure and protect them when ultra nationalists in the south threatened Muslim communities in several parts of the country with violence. Members of the Muslim community felt that the State failed to take firm and quick measures to prevent or contain anti-Muslim attacks and swiftly enforce the law against the perpetrators.
The biggest blow to the credibility of the present government was the much talked about Central Bank bond scam. This needs no discussion here except to say that it provided a convenient cover for the members of the previous government to hide behind and take public attention away from many corruption allegations against several leading opposition personalities.
Reeling under heavy fiscal pressure arising out of accumulated domestic and foreign debts, largely inherited from the previous regime, government has not been able to make significant social investments in critically important sectors such as education, health, public transport and science and technology, all of which are very important not only to provide sustainable relief to low income groups, improve the life chances of restless youth, facilitate the transition from labour intensive to technology intensive development and create a conducive environment for private investment. Yet, the fallout from the bond scam, persisting political instability and uncertainty and the growing disunity among the members of the regime prevented any major inflow of foreign investment. Meanwhile, increasing economic and social pressure encouraged large numbers of skilled and unskilled workers to look for work outside the country, making already serious labour market situation worse.
Educated unemployed
As is well known, the country had a distinct advantage with respect to availability and affordability of labour in the late 1970's making the country attractive to foreign investors but this situation changed rapidly over the last few decades making labour a real issue for local enterprises as well as foreign investors.
Yet, Human Resources development has received scant attention from the relevant Ministries and institutions. This is in spite of the fact that there is a Human Resource Development Council in the country maintained at public expense. The lack of adequate investments in the education sector over the years resulted in a gradual decline in the quality of both general and higher education and the products of public education system became increasingly unemployable in a competitive private sector environment.
The issue remained largely concealed due to both overseas migration of labour and the mass absorption of most of the educated unemployed into the state sector. Yet, the persisting unrest among unemployed graduates has shown clearly that the failure of successive governments to address the problems in the public education system has not only hampered economic and social development but also led to unrest among youth, at times resulting in violent anti-State youth uprisings in the country. What is also noteworthy is that the declining quality of public education has also adversely affected the quality of teachers, politicians, professionals and public servants with serious implications. There is more than enough evidence to support the last assertion.
It is against the above background that the successive governments have failed to bring about the necessary institutional and policy improvements to address the growing problems in the country. For instance, governments in recent years have done almost nothing to revamp the agricultural and industrial sectors when the open economic policies exposed them to international competition. Similarly, when the products of the public education system could not fit into the private sector due to lack of skills, little was done to equip them with the skills in demand. Moreover, expanding private transport, private education, and private health services attracted more and more consumers, but nothing much was done to maintain publicly provided services to reduce economic pressure on households, forcing the latter to earn more money in whatever way possible. This has significantly contributed to the spread of petty and not so petty corruption in the country.
So far in the present article, I have made an effort to provide the background to the social and political issues that have emerged in the country over the last several decades, in particular, over the last few years. The only way to resolve these issues is to strengthen the institutional fabric of the State, adopt evidence based rational policies in diverse sectors and develop and implement diverse interventions. This is exactly what was expected from the regime that came into power in 2015. But, today, we have a full blown economic, social and political crisis in the country, largely due to the inability of the regime to take the measures mentioned above on a priority basis in a coordinated.
The reasons for this situation are many but the resulting public disillusionment and frustrations can only lead to a much worse situation in the country in the near future because people can hardly think of a better political alternative. This is the dilemma that the citizens in this country are faced with today. So, it is absolutely necessary to mobilise the institutional and other resources at our disposal to come up with an urgent plan of action to deal with the situation. While the state institutions need to be activated to carry out their statutory mandates effectively, those institutions that deal with pressing problems of the ordinary people need to be prioritised. The other priorities of the country are well known and there is no need to repeat here

## Title: Judicial competence of Privy Council

Judicial competence of Privy Council
The Acts offended against the Constitution in that they amounted to a direction to convict the men or to a legislative plan to secure their conviction and severe punishment and thus constituted an unjustifiable assumption of judicial power, by the legislature, or an interference with judicial power, which was outside the legislatures competence and was inconsistent with the severance of power between legislature, executive and judiciary which the constitution ordained.
- Lord Pearce: Privy Council
In England the highest Judicial Court is the House of Lords, the 2nd Chamber. However, it is well understood that only a very few legally qualified members or peers take part in its judicial work. They are life members or life peers known as Lords of appeal. They also serve as Members of Judicial Committee of Privy Council, and this Council hears the appeals of Commonwealth countries that have not severed its connections with the Crown.
As per The Judicial Committee of the Privy Councils ruling on December 21, 1965, Special Acts passed by the Parliament to deal with persons charged with conspiring in the failed Coup de 'tat of January 27, 1962, amounted to an interference with the judicial tasks. This was fatal to the legislations validity. They quashed the convictions of Douglas Liyanage, Col. F. C. de Saram, C. C. Dissanayake, Sydney de Zoysa, Admiral Royce de Mel, Col Noel Matthysz, Col Basil Jesudasan, T. V. Wijesinghe, L. C. S. Jiresinghe and V. E. Perera, who were found guilty on three counts of conspiracy to wage war against the Queen and to overawe and to overthrow the Ceylon government accused sentenced at the coup trial in the Supreme Court to ten years imprisonment and confiscation of all their property.
Limited to a Preliminary point raising on the question of validity of the special legislation the Criminal Law (Special Provisions) Act and the Criminal Law Act both of 1962, under which the men were tried and sentenced was argued in the Privy Council appeal. Lord Pearce who delivered the Privy Councils judgement, said the detailed story of the Coup, the names of 30 alleged conspirators and the parts played by them and how it was foiled at the very last moment was set out in a White Paper of the Ceylon government issued on February 13, 1962.
Extracts from Privy Councils Judgement
Lord Pearce (Edward Holroyd Pearce) delivered the judgement of the Coup.
It is assumed that the coup was intended by certain army and police officers with the aim of overthrowing the government and arresting among others the Deputy Minister for Defence and External Affairs since he could give orders to the services which might disturb the takeover.
Lord Pearce continued. It provided that Minister of Justice could direct that they should be tried by three judges without a jury. It also provided that the three judges could be nominated by the minister. The Supreme Court upheld a preliminary objection that the power of nomination conferred on the Minister was invalid and the second act was enacted providing that the Chief Justice could nominate three judges.
E. F. N. Gratiaen QC, Counsel for the accused, attacked the validity of convictions on three main grounds, that the Ceylon Parliament was limited by an incapacity to pass legislation which was contrary to fundamental principles of justice. The 1962 Acts it was said were contrary to such principles in that they not only were directed against individuals but also ex post facto created crimes and punishments, and destroyed fair safeguards by which those individuals would otherwise be protected. The third argument was that the language of the Acts did not suffice to deprive the men of the right to a jury, which they had acquired before the passing of those Acts.
On the first argument, it was said that the sovereigns right of the United Kingdom Parliament was not in terms transferred to Ceylon on Independence. Therefore the legislative power of Ceylon was still limited by the inability, which it inherited from the crown, to pass laws which offended against fundamental principlesa vague and uncertain phrase which might arguably be called in aid against some of the statutes passed by any sovereign power. The joint effect of the Ceylon (Constitution) Order-in-Council 1946 and the Ceylon Independence Act of 1947 was intended to and did have the result of giving to the Ceylon Parliament the full legislative powers of a sovereign independent State.
Lord Pearce commented: It would be regrettable if the procedure adopted in giving independence to Ceylon has produced the situation for which the appellants contend. In the view of their Lordships, however such a contention is maintainable.
In Ceylon, the change of sovereignty did not in itself produce any apparent change in the constituents or the functioning of the judicature. The constitutions silence as to the vesting of judicial power was consistent to the remaining where it had lain for more than a century in the hands of the judicature, remarked Lord Pearce.
In the present case Their Lordships had no doubt that there was an interference with the functions of judiciary. The Acts of 1962 were clearly aimed at particular known individuals who had been named in a White Paper and were imprisoned awaiting their fate. Such a lack of generality in criminal legislation need not of itself involve the judicial function and their lordships were not prepared to hold that very enactment in this field must inevitably usurp or infringe the judicial power. Each case must be decided in the light of its own facts and circumstances.
The true nature and purpose of these enactments are revealed by their conjoint impact on these specific proceedings, in respect of which they were designed, and they take their colour, in particular, from the alterations they purported to make as to their ultimate objective, the punishment of those convicted. Lord Pearce said.
These alterations constitute a grave and deliberate incursion into the judicial sphere. Quite bluntly, their aim was to ensure that the judges in dealing with these particular persons on these particular charges were deprived of their normal discretion as respects appropriate sentences.
They were compelled to sentence each offender on conviction to not less than 10 years imprisonment and compelled to order confiscation of his possessions even though his part in the conspiracy might have been trivial. Lord Pearce said in conclusion:  if such Acts as these were valid the judicial power could be wholly absorbed by the legislature and taken out of the hands of the judges. It is appreciated that the legislator had no such general intention. It was beset by a grave situation and it took grave measures to deal with it, thinking one must presume that it had power to do so and was acting lightly.
but that consideration is irrelevant and gives no validity to acts which infringed the constitution. What is done once, if it be allowed may be done again and in a lesser crisis and less serious circumstances. And thus judicial powers may be eroded. Such an erosion is contrary to the clear intension of the constitution. In Their Lordships view the Acts were ultra vires and invalid. It was agreed between the parties that if the Acts were invalid the convictions could not stand and the appeals would therefore be allowed, Lord Pearce added.
1972 Constitution  Ending Jurisdiction of PC
In 1972 the UF Government of Sirimavo introduced a Republican Constitution, instituting freedom from the fetters of colonial domination, a free, sovereign republic. The alien apex Privy Council was replaced with Supreme Court as our highest appellate court.

Kindness at its best
We who are parents of normal children simply do not understand how lucky we are.
Recently I stopped at a traffic light. A father and son walked on the pedestrian crossing. The father was holding the autistic boys hand, guiding him to the opposite pavement.
Probably, that is what he is doing from the time the child was born to the day the father dies. Such is the perpetual responsibility of a parent who raises an autistic child.
Dinesh Fernando is 31 years old and does not even have a bicycle to call his own.
He founded Mother Charity (www.mothercfsl.lk) This organization is a daycare for autistic children. They have two homes, Pathum Uyana in Aluthgama and Niduk Piyasa in Puhulwella, Kirinda. Both places are housed in two temples. Dinesh is a Catholic, what has autism got to do with religion
When I first met Dinesh, I thought he is a fool. He was making attempts to run a day care centre for autistic children when he himself was barely managing to make ends meet. That was Pathum Uyana.
And 3 years later he started Niduk Piyasa still struggling to make ends meet. I was convinced he was a champion fool. It is a while since all this happened. Now I must admit that I am the fool. Dinesh plodded and pleaded and prayed and today he has more than 50 autistic children who attend his two centres.
I really do not know how he does it. But I know for sure he and his support team are doing a wonderful job of label-less charity, service of the purest kind.
I salute you Dinesh, I salute all those who are associated with you to pull off this magnificent service to humanity.
I saw the autistic boy crossing the road with his father, and I drove off.

Lankas insurance growth  momentum to continue - Fitch
Fitch Ratings says that they expect the insurance sector to continue its growth momentum.
This will be driven primarily by the rising per capita income, growing awareness on insurance, and considerably lower insurance penetration supporting the growth potential, Fitch states in their Sri Lanka Insurance Dashboard 2H18 review.
The Gross written premiums for life and non-life businesses grew by 13% and 22%, respectively, in 2017 (2016: 18%, 14%).
The report also states that the exposure of Sri Lankas non-life insurers to extreme weather-related events is manageable due to extensive use of reinsurance. However, reinsurers are seen to be reducing ceding commissions to reflect the increasing risk of catastrophes.
Sri Lanka has seen a recurrence of extreme weather-related events  back-to-back floods in May 2018 and over the past two years, and a prolonged drought in several parts of the country. We believe this may raise long-term risks for insurers capital.
Fitch expects changes in the Inland Revenue Act, which came into effect on 1 April 2018, to lower the net profits of life insurers as surplus distributions to shareholders from policyholder funds and investment income of shareholder funds (less allowable expenses) are taxed at 28%. Earlier, most of the life insurers paid lower taxes under the investment income minus management fees method, which resulted in a lower tax base.
In addition, distributions to participating life policyholders, which were not taxed previously, are now taxed at 14% and will be increased to 28% from 2021.
Further industry consolidation is likely, given the competitive nature of the non-life insurance market where some players are incurring underwriting losses, the report adds.
In addition, recent regulatory developments including higher capital requirements and split of composites have also hastened consolidation.
There have been four merger or acquisition deals since 2014, including Allianz SEs (Insurer Financial Strength: AA/Stable) acquisition of 100% of Janashakthi General Insurance Limited in early 2018.
We expect insurers investment income to remain stable owing to their large allocation to fixed-income investments whose returns are likely to remain mostly steady in 2H18. We expect insurers to maintain a considerable exposure to government and corporate debt securities while limiting allocations to the volatile equity market.
Fitch expects the credit metrics of rated insurers to remain intact in 2H18, following satisfactory capitalisation and sustained market share.

Let dreams take flight
Head Girl of Newstead Girls College Negombo Ruwandi Aluthweera is a voice for Social Conscience and Nature. Perfect Prefects feature Aluthweera an advocate for burning issues and matters that require immediate attention.
Aluthweera is extremely concerned about environmental and social issues, believing in a clean and ordered society and world.
Living beings
Living together harmoniously with other human beings should not be our only concern. We should be mindful of the fact that we share this world with other living beings. There are so many endangered species, and we need to protect them before they disappear forever. I am completely against killing animals to satisfy ones egotistical desires, explained Aluthweera.
The gravity of this problem outlined by Aluthweera may be fully understood if one does his or her own research on the web, and finds out that a very large number of species are critically endangered to the point of extinction.
In addition to this problem concerning nature, Aluthweera outlined a problem that is at once social and psychological, which involves mainly humans.
We are not born into this world with hate in us. We discriminate because our societies have taught us to do that. That is why there is colour, racial, religious and gender discrimination. If children are taught to love, they can spread it all over the world. That can change the world, said Aluthweera.
Priorities
Proper manners and consideration for others also rank highly on her list of priorities.
I dislike seeing the road littered with paper bags and all sorts of discarded items. When I see junk on the road, I think to myself  Why cant people learn to be clean and orderly Sometimes I pick up the trash and put it into a rubbish bin. It is one small thing I can do, but if I can do it and everyone does it, the world will be a beautiful and clean paradise to live in. I think people should be more concerned about the environment they live in. We must recycle as much as possible, points out Aluthweera.
Having a social conscience is one of the most important things in life. Even simple things like keeping a toilet clean which are used by the public indicates what kind of a person you are  whether you are responsible and empathetic or indifferent, disorderly, unclean and untidy.
Nature is the most beautiful asset we have on earth. It is the earth itself. We take trees for granted. Trees are like a second mother to us. Most of us do not realize they provided us with oxygen. They are life givers. They can live without us. But we cannot live without them. We, humans, emerged long after Mother Nature.
Over a million seabirds, whales, seals, dolphins, sea turtles, and so on have died from plastic debris that ends up in our oceans and seas. 100,000 sharks are also part of the death toll. Plastic ends up inside these animals (especially birds), which can lead to their deaths. The impact of plastic pollution in our oceans and ecosystems creates chaos for the environment.
Universe
There is a whole world out there beyond the classroom. A whole world to discover and explore. Science is the light that helps us see the universe. The governments of this world need to take swift action to save our eco-systems before it is too late. They need to do a lot more than what they are doing now, and act because various life forms on earth are under threat, added Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also pointed out the need for equality, saying that it is the duty of the public and private sector to treat people equally.
I feel that institutions need to treat everyone who comes for their services equally without differentiating. Sometimes they favour politically or socially powerful individuals over the common man. That is why I say that they should treat everyone equally, said Aluthweera.
Development
Aluthweera did not forget to thank her father and mother for what she has become and also extended her thanks to the Principal of Newstead, the staff and her colleagues and committee members.
My parents are both doctors. They are my biggest inspiration. I have seen how they both help the sick. This has motivated me to become a more caring and better person. My school has done so much for me. I remember at a Leadership training program, we were taught to think out of the box, to be creative and come up with solutions. We need to look at the bigger picture and put things in perspective, stated Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also pointed out that knowledgeable people must be in positions of authority in our society. This affects the progress and development of the country.
We need leaders who care about the problems the people in the country face and genuinely want to do something about it. We also need to learn from history and prepare for the future. But we also need to remember that we have to live in the present, explained Aluthweera.
Aluthweera also emphasized on the fact that one does not need to face ones problems alone. She does not have to face problems alone because there are so many who love her, help her and support her. She is currently doing her A/Ls in the bioscience stream and hopes to go to university one day and become a doctor.
The ideal role model for young people is someone who can relate to young people, who know their thoughts and someone who has experience in life. My school has given me so many opportunities to gather new experiences and to do what I have not done before. I firmly believe in leading by example, said Aluthweera.

Preschools in the Matara District will remain closed for another week to protect children from contracting influenza and preventing its spread, said Matara District Preschool Development Foundation Secretary Manori Ilangamge.
Preschools in the Southern Province were which were closed for a week by Provincial Minister of Education Chandima Rasaputhra to prevent the spread of influenza, were scheduled to reopen on June 4, but as the spread of the respiratory tract infection continued and the number of deaths kept rising, the Preschool Development Foundation opted to keep them closed for another week.

Meet the other Meghan  Markle
Oh, look, its Danielle Harris, a 33-year-old from the U.S.
Or is it Meghan Markle, former actor and the new Duchess of Sussex
Its easy to get the two confused, apparently, as Danielle claims she gets mistaken for Meghan Markle at least four times a week.
Just to add to the mass confusion, Danielle also got married (back in January 2017) and wore a white wedding dress.
So thats two women who are mixed race, have freckles and dark hair, and were once a bride. How on earth are people supposed to tell these two apart
Danielles wedding was a little different to Prince Harry and Meghan Markles, mind you, costing $50,000  just 0.001% of the price of the royal wedding.
While Meghan wore Givenchy, Danielle wore a simple white gown that cost $1,800 (1,348). While Meghan got married in St Georges Chapel, Danielle tied the knot in Clayton on the Park in Scottsdale, Arizona, USA.
Meghan had 600 guests, Danielle had 115. Meghans wedding was pretty fancy considering it was a royal affair, Danielles was a giant party with guests dancing to a local DJ.
So, yeah, a few key differences there.
But no, that doesnt stop the Meghan comparisons, says Danielle.
My husband and I were in the Gucci store in Dallas and they were taking so long to wrap up my things I couldnt understand it, says Danielle.
Until all the sales associates came out of the back to meet me. It was so funny. On Friday I was standing in the grocery store line and this old lady in front of me had a magazine with Meghan on it.
She started doing a double take and said Has anyone ever told you.. but I just finished her sentence for her.
Everyone always tells me Danielle, you need to get a job as her double. My husband even jokes that hed be my manager.
It was four years ago when a mutual friend first said to me that I look just like Rachel Zane, Meghans character in Suits.
I didnt watch the show then, but I couldnt see the similarities when she showed me the picture.
I didnt think much of it until the past year or so when Meghan and Harrys relationship became public.
If I had five dollars for everyone who has said I look like her over the last 12 months I would be so rich.
Thankfully Danielle isnt bothered by the comparisons.
Were both mixed race and I also have freckles like Meghan, she says.
Shes so beautiful I think its a huge compliment when people tell me we look alike. It makes me laugh.

MEPA, Coca-Cola celebrates World Environmental Day
The Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA), under the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment, in partnership with Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. (CCBSL) celebrated World Environment Day with a Mangrove Cleaning Program at Negombo Lagoon on May 30.
The initiative encompassed three sites of Kings Island, Pitipana Road and the Ferry Harbour in Negombo, where the mangroves are located. The event was a complete success and witnessed participation of approximately 800 participants across Government, NGOs, CBOs, universities and community, with the private sector being represented by Coca-Cola.
CCBSL launched its custom Coca-Cola Give Back Life PET recycling bins. Effective partnership with the government ensures the coverage and efficiency of PET recovery and recycling schemes led by volunteer mobilisation in key locations of national importance from a biodiversity and ecosystem standpoint, such as this collection program with MEPA.
Commenting on the occasion Rear Admiral (RTD) Rohana Perera - Chairman, Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA), added, Mangroves are key to healthy coastal ecosystems but are increasingly under threat. The Mangrove Cleaning Program was an apt initiative to drive awareness of the need to nurture mangroves.
Mayank Arora - Managing Director, CCBSL said, Coca-Cola is the beverage industry leader and is committed to spearhead the way in finding solutions for problems impacting our environment.
Our global goal is to help collect and recycle a bottle or can for everyone we sell by 2030 and we will work with the Government, NGOs and civil society bodies to achieve this goal. We are proud to partner with The Marine Environmental Protection Authority (MEPA) yet again following last years National Coastal and Marine Resources Conservation Week clean-up where we collected and recycled over 35,000 PET plastic bottles.
Deeply engaged in driving environmental protection and conservation initiatives, Coca-Cola works with a host of partners in and will continue to do so in the coming years to deliver its global World Without Waste packaging vision, which includes collecting and recycling a bottle for everyone it sells globally by 2030 and renewing its focus on the entire packaging lifecycle.

The Medical Faculty Students Action Committee (MFSAC) has written to President Maithripala Sirisena in connection with the efforts now being made to re-establish SAITM through a court procedure, the Convener of the Committee Didula Amarasinghe said.
Amarasinghe called on the Government to immediately declare the abolishing of SAITM in writing through a legal document and inform the same to the judiciary.
Until then, the students will continue their struggle against SAITM and the selling free education, he said.
He was speaking at a press conference yesterday.
In the letter the committee mentioned that it would stand by doing justice for the SAITM students but is strongly opposed to using them to justify the Government's programme to sell free education while ignoring all proposals presented by Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC), Faculty of Medicine Teachers Associations (FMTA), the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and all anti SAITM organisations, he added.

More bodies recovered from Guatemala volcano
GUATEMALA: Rescue workers pulled more bodies on Monday from under the dust and rubble left by an explosive eruption of Guatemala's Fuego volcano, bringing the death toll to at least 69.
Of them, 17 have been identified so far, said Fanuel Garcia, head of the National Institute of Forensic Sciences.
In addition, there are 46 people injured, most of them seriously, more than 1.7 million being hit by the disaster, including 3,271 ordered evacuated and 1,787 in shelters in the departments of Escuintla, Sacatepequez and Chimaltenango since Sunday's eruption.
The 3,763-meter (12,346-foot) volcano erupted early Sunday, spewing out towering plumes of ash and a hail of fiery rock fragments with scalding mud.
Authorities had warned the death toll could rise after searches resumed for survivors in communities on the mountain's southern flank.
After an initial toll of 25 dead, it was revised upwards within hours as bodies were recovered from villages razed by the tumbling mud.
There are missing persons, but we do not know how many, said Sergio Cabanas of Guatemala's disaster management agency. A roll call of communities on the slopes of the volcano was under way.
The speed and ferocity of the eruption took mountain communities by surprise, with many of the dead found in or around their homes.
Cabanas said those who were killed had been overrun by fast-moving burning material discharged by the volcano Sunday. Communities located on its southern slope were the worst hit. Several of the dead were children.
An AFP journalist saw at least three bodies burned in the rubble of the village of San Miguel Los Lotes, where rescue workers, soldiers and police were desperately searching for survivors.
Dead dogs, chickens and ducks also lay among the mud and ash, much of it still smoking.
I do not want to leave, but go back, and there is nothing I can do to save my family, a weeping Eufemia Garcia, 48, told AFP. She was searching for her three children, her mother, nephews and siblings.
Garcia, from Los Lotes, said she escaped with the help of her husband.
UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was deeply saddened by the tragic loss of life and the significant damage caused by the eruption, and said the UN was ready to assist national rescue and relief efforts.
President Jimmy Morales, who has declared three days of national mourning, visited the disaster zone.
The volcano has erupted before, but never like this, said Gustavo Larius, a 27-year-old bricklayer searching the streets of his village for missing family and friends, a handkerchief pressed over his mouth and nose.
The eruption sent ash billowing over the surrounding area, turning plants and trees gray and blanketing streets, cars and people.
Farmers covered in ash fled for their lives as civil defense workers tried to relocate them to shelters.
This time we were saved; in another (eruption) no, said Efrain Gonzalez, 52, sitting on the floor of a shelter in the city of Escuintla, where he arrived with his wife and one-year-old daughter.
Gonzalez was overwhelmed with despair, as two more of his children, aged 10 and four, are missing. They were trapped in their home, which was flooded with hot mud that descended from the volcano.
Dense ash blasted out by the volcano shut down Guatemala City's international airport, civil aviation officials said.
The eruption ended after 16.5 hours, but there is a likelihood that it will reactivate warned the Institute of Volcanology.
The speed of the eruption took locals by surprise, and could be explained by it producing pyroclastic flows, sudden emissions of gas and rock fragments, rather than lava, said volcanologist David Rothery of Britain's Open University.
A lava flow rarely travels fast enough to engulf people, he said.
The videos and still images I've seen suggest instead one or more pyroclastic flows. This is when a violently erupted mass of rock fragments and hot gas finds itself too dense to rise as an ash column and instead cascades down the volcano's slopes.
Pyroclastic flows or surges can move at over 100 kilometers (62 miles) per hour, and may be hot enough to glow like molten lava. They can travel further, as well as much faster, than lava flows, said Rothery.
Fuego has been erupting since 2002, and was continuously active in 2017. There were explosions and ash plumes and a volcanic mudflow last month.- AFP

Moves to provide relief to farmers
The Agriculture Ministry is planning to grant relief to farmers who suffered crop damages in recent times due to incessant rains and other inclement weather conditions.
With this objective in view, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera on Monday, directed officials to submit an urgent report to him containing information about crop damages suffered by farmers, recently.
He said he hoped to submit a memorandum to the government to provide relief to affected farmers based on this report.
The minister said there were reports about vast damages caused to crops in several agricultural areas in the country, including the hill country, due to inclement weather conditions.
As a result, prices of upcountry vegetables had drastically increased in the market.
This was the result of destruction caused to crops cultivated by farmers due to heavy rains.

Multi-national ERP implementation by Providence Global
Mamiya-OP a multi-national conglomerate with head offices in Japan along with regional offices in the United States and Bangladesh has successfully implemented enterprise resource planning.
Providence Global a premier provider of enterprise resource planning services implemented Abas ERP across the organizations manufacturing and distribution network situated in Bangladesh. The implementation team at Providence was able to draw on its experience in the manufacturing space along with specialists in finance, logistics and inventory management.
The parent company Mamiya-OP focuses primarily on sporting goods with a special production unit in Chittagong, Bangladesh, which caters to global orders for golf shafts and arrows. Mamiya-OP manufactures golf shafts for most major brands with its state of the art facility and an employee base of over 4000 staff. With an expansive network catering from the Americas to the Far East, the Providence Global team had to ensure that the implemented ERP catered to global challenges such as the implementation of a multi-currency ledger, automated purchasing and sales order booking to name a few.
Its not the first time the team at Providence has implemented ERP systems overseas but what makes this project special is the cross-cultural team and the knowledge pool of various consultants from Mamiya-OP, UST-Mamiya and Providence. A highly knowledgeable team, along with commitment from all stakeholders made the project a success, said General Manager, Asela Mudannayake.
The project implemented all areas of enterprise resource planning software, which included sales, purchasing, manufacturing, inventory control along with related material valuation.
The integration across all sites allowed Mamiya-OP not only to increase their efficiencies but also have greater transparency across the organization.
Speaking on behalf of Mamiya-OP, Bangladesh, Sapu, Manager IT said, We at the MOPB manufacturing plant always need to interact with our sales office in the United States for their production requirements, material planning and scheduling delivery. Due to the time zone differences, the integrated system reduced error rates and increased transparency across two continents. It is a great achievement for us to integrate our demand and procure management processes through ABAS ERP by using EDI technology, in addition to many other specific requirements to the golf manufacturing industry. Providence is a very supportive software integrator, and their commitment to the project helped us achieve project success within a relatively short period of time.
Adding to Sapus comments, Aymen Alasad (IT Manager  UST Mamiya) said, Our manufacturing plant in Bangladesh adds value to all processes through the implementation of ABAS ERP across the organization. I would like to highlight the continuous support and technical expertise from the Providence Global team.
They were able to surpass our expectations and integrate all of our requirements easily with the ERP. We loved the training and implementation process used by them as they worked alongside our team every step of the way.
It was our very first cross functional implementation at the Bangladesh site from a manual system, and the Providence system prepared the organization and users for system migration and integration with great success.

National Movement to Protect Sri Lanka conducts protest
The National Movement to Protect Sri Lanka yesterday held a protest march in Colombo against the privatisation of unused state plantation land.
The group of environmental activists, university students and young professionals were led by the group Hadabima Surakina Jathika Satana.
The group marched around Viharamahadevi Park shouting slogans against deforestation,the privatization of state plantations and the leasing of estate land near Knuckles rainforest.
The march coincided with World Environment Day which fell yesterday.
Protect Sri Lanka, National Organizer, Palitha Wickremaratne said they had just taken two weeks to organise the protest and that those who attended were enough to change things, We dont need great numbers. All of you here came voluntarily and that is important.
They allege that the former Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim had through the Cabinet Paper bearing number 2017/18 had given out 60,000 acres in the Central Province for private businesses.
According to the Sri Lanka State Plantation Corporation however, the total extent of land owned by the government is only 23,927 acres.
Protect Sri Lanka Executive Member Shashikalana Ratwatte also spoke of the need to stand up against environmental degradation in the country.
We will fight for Knuckles as we fought for Wilpattu. We were not able to stop the destruction of Wilpattu completely but we were able to have everyone talk about it until development was arrested within the forest, he said.
He also alleged that Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma was involved in giving out 4,000 acres of flood plain land to his supporters.
Sajeewa Chamikara of the land and agriculture reform movement in the meantime alleged that the government was preparing a National Resource Plan 2018-2050 to privatise many state owned lands for industries, large scale agriculture and foreign investments.
He asked that those who were gathered to come together to oppose the sale of natural resources.

Nectar in sieve
Heard together, their voice stands out straight and relaxed. Their attempt erodes the norms of Sri Lankan tradition. It is not a single play. Nor is it a duet. It is a collective effort of five eminent vocalists.
Interest in folk music and other buried aspects of national culture tends to be reawakened at moments when there's a perceived danger of things being lost forever.
Successive folk revivals of the 20th century drew their impetus equally from the two historical landmarks that most permeate the collective unconscious: the industrial revolution and the first world war.
In the late 1960s and early 70s, fear of annihilation, technological progress and a vision of alternative societies filtered through popular and underground culture, conspiring to promote the ideal of "getting back to the garden". Folk is only one of many ingredients in the mix during these charged moments: psychedelics, environmentalism and the political and energy crises of the early 70s all played their part too.
In our own time, though, the word "folk" no longer refers solely to particular songs and melodies attached to the ancient lore of the land, nor to techniques of singing, instrumentality and delivery, nor to the idea of particular music belonging to small, often rural communities, or even a nation. Folk still includes these preserved traditions, but it is also applied to areas of contemporary music.
Yet well I ken the banks where amaranths blow,
Have traced the fount whence streams of nectar flow.
Bloom, O ye amaranths! bloom for whom ye may,
For me, ye bloom not! Glide, rich streams, away!
With lips unbrighten'd, wreathless brow, I stroll:
And would you learn the spells that drowse my soul
Work without Hope draws nectar in a sieve,
And Hope without an object cannot live.
(Samuel Coleridge, Work Without Hope)
And now, we are about to enter a new era. Makaranda means nectar in English, and best tasted before while it is stuck in the sieve.
Sri Lankan music needs such a potential right now. With iconic musicians of the calibre of Dr WD Amaradeva dead and gone, most quarters would take it to be the doomsday of the local music industry.
But it is not so, thanks to a few legendary musicians such as Nissanka Diddeniya, Rodney Warnakula, Indika Upamali, Saman Lenin, Navaratne Gamage and Nilakshi Helapitiya. This sextet will introduce a fresh wave of hope to the stagnating music.

A new state hospital will be constructed at a cost of Rs. 7,000 million to replace the existing congested Dambulla Base Hospital, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, the new hospital is to be constructed according to a European plan and it will be constructed in a five-acre land donated by Rangiri Dambulu Raja Maha Viharaya. The accident ward and the OPD will continue to function in the old hospital while all other parts will be relocated.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that funds have been provided to develop all state hospitals without considering whether they belong to the central government or the provincial councils.
In 2015, the central government provided Rs. 90 million to develop provincial hospitals while this amount increased to Rs. 685 million in 2016.
All state hospitals serve the people. Both patients and the health staff face various difficulties due to the congestion that exists in the Dambulla Base Hospital at present.
Temporary solutions will not work and only a permanent solution will solve the problem, the minister added.

Nilakshi de Silva spearheads Sri Lanka to huge win
One day after being demolished by India by 142 runs, tournament hosts Malaysia succumbed to Sri Lanka by 90 runs in the Women's Asia Cup in Kuala Lumpur. Chasing 137, Malaysia managed just 46 for 7 despite batting all 20 overs.
Sri Lanka's victory was spearheaded by the right-arm medium-pacer Nilakshi de Silva, who snared a career-best 3 for 13. It followed a solid show from the Sri Lankan top-order, as Sri Lanka rose to second on the points table, below India.
Sri Lanka's new-ball tandem made life hard for Malaysia early in the chase.
While Oshadi Ranasinghe took out Yusrina Yaakop in her first over, Shashikala Siriwardene maintained the pressure at the other end with a stingy opening spell in which she gave away just a solitary run in three overs.
As a result, the time was ripe for de Silva, and she landed a double-blow in her second over, dismissing Winifred Duraisingam, the Malaysia captain, and Mas Elysa, to leave Malaysia tottering at 14 for 3. She then added a third wicket - that of Malaysia's top-scorer Christina Baret - to finish with 4-1-13-3. Siriwardene bagged two middle-order wickets.
Malaysia's attack didn't let the Sri Lankan line-up go untested earlier in the game.
The Azmis - medium-pacer Sasha and fingerspinner Zumika - kept the leash on the opposition with combined returns of 1 for 22 off seven overs. Sasha dealt Sri Lanka the first blow, removing opener Yasoda Mendis, who top-scored with a brisk 29-ball 36. Mendis' fifty-stand with Nipuni Hansika shepherded Sri Lanka to 59 for 1 at about the halfway mark. But the duo's departure, within two overs of each other, caused a slump in the scoring rate.
That Sri Lanka finished on 136 for 7 was largely down to Hasini Perera's 27-ball 32 at No.4. Perera struck four fours, three of them off the last three balls of the innings, as Sri Lanka finished strongly with 39 runs off the last three overs.
Scores: Sri Lanka Women 136-3 in 20 overs (Yasoda Mendis 36, Nipuni Hansika 20, Anushka Sanjeewani 26, Hasini Perera 32 n.o.)
Malaysia Women 46-7 in 20 overs (Christina Baret 14, Nilakshi de Silva 3/13, Shashikala Siriwardene 2/12)

The Bond Commission report does not contain names of 118 MPs relating to any involvement in financial transactions, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC said.

The Attorney General responding to a question told the Daily News that the publication of the C350 document of the Bond Commission report does not cause any legal impediment to the ongoing investigations and he had informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Secretary to the President Austin Fernando about this.
The Attorney General said this information was sent to the Speaker and the Secretary to the President in response to a request made to him by the Secretary to the President for a legal opinion on any legal implications involved in publishing the C350 document of the Bond Commission report. Meanwhile, the Speakers media unit said sections C350 to C360 of the Bond Commission Report, which had not been released previously, were handed over to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya by Presidential Secretariat officials in Parliament yesterday.

Odissi odyssey
Odissi is an important classical dance form of the East Indian Orissa state. The Odissi originated from Kalinga Desha of India, presently known as Orissa. Earlier Odissi dancers were males. They were called Kothipuwar. The male dancers dressed as females. It is essentially a temple dance. Many of the Odissi dance teachers were known as Kothipuwar. The male dancers (Kothipuwar) still dance.
Odissi received royal patronage from kings. According to one of the inscriptions, king Kharavela of the second century B.C encouraged the dance and music forms by carving the figures of dancers and musicians in the caves.
Hand gestures
The Jagannath Temple of Puri was built during the reign of King Chodaganga Deva who belonged to Ganga dynasty which lasted more than four centuries. He introduced the Maharis (Devadasis) to serve in the Lord Jagannath temple at Puri. Still, his contribution to the art is recognised and celebrated in Orissa. Interpreting the meaning of the songs through dance was generally done through hand gestures and facial expressions. This type of interpretation of songs through dance was introduced in Odissi during the Suriya dynasty.
The music of Odissi is a fusion of Carnatic and Hindustani music. Traditionally, Kothipuwars danced on two important occasions. One was Chandra Jatra and the other JhoolanJatra. Initially, the dance form was based on the Vaishnava cult. Later it was cherished and adopted in Saivaism. In the past, they adorned themselves with many ornaments, but today they use a limited number of ornaments.
In the past, the Maharis were trained to perform a dance in the temples. Abinayachandrika which is still considered a complete work on Odissi dance was written by Maheshwar Mohapatra, a Minister of King Narayanadevas court.
Political changes
Later Odissi dancers were divided into three categories. The first group consisted of temple dancers. Maharis were royal court dancers. Nachunis were the Kothipuwar, the male dancers who performed for the public. With the passage of time, due to the political changes, mainly during the Muslim rule the dance lost the religious values and the art was preserved for entertainment purposes.
Generally, most of the Indian classical dance forms enjoyed royal patronage to some extent. Due to royal patronage and encouragement, all the Indian classical dance forms have developed and acquired worldwide recognition today. Sometimes Bharatha Natyam and Odissi are confused by the public. However, there are many differences between the two dance forms. The costumes and ornaments of Odissi resemble those of Bharatha Natyam. Bharatha Natyam and Odissi were nurtured in and around the temples.
The male dancers in Odissi were called Kothipuwar. They were dressed as females. The female dancers were generally called Mahari'. In Odissi, the body is in the thribhaga position. The body is displayed in three curved positions. One is the head position; the other is the shoulder to navel position. The last is the navel to feet position. Nirtha and Nirtya are used in Odissi as in Bharatha Natyam. Odissi also uses facial expressions. Odissi and Bharatha Natyam have adapted the Araimandi position. Jewellery used in Odissi is almost similar to Bharatha Natyam. The jewellery in Odissi is made of silver or coated with silver.
Dance essence
They do not use stone studded jewellery. The Bharatha Natyam research centres are around Chidambaram and Thanjavur temples. The Odissi research centre is around the sculptures of the Konark temple. Odissi reflects the beauty of Bharatha Natyam and the essence of Manipuri dance together. Odissi originated in the Kalinga Pradesh and the poses depict Kalinga sculptures.
In Bharatha Natyam dance poses resemble the temple dance and Thandava poses. There are certain similarities between Odissi and Bharatha Natyam in items. Geethagovinda songs are widely used in Odissi while in Bharatha Natyam Geetha Govinda songs are used in Astapathy.

Kumarasiris name was proposed as post had to be retained from govt ranks:PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the name of MP Ananda Kumarasiri was proposed because the Deputy Speaker post had to be retained within Government ranks.
He told Parliament yesterday, that the convention when appointing the Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees, was that two of them are from Government ranks, while one from the Opposition.
He made this observation in response to Opposition Leader R Sampanthan, who urged the Government to accept the SLFP nomination of Dr Sudarshini Fernandopulle for the Deputy Speakers post.
The PM replied that it was the TNA who objected to the initial proposal by the Government to appoint SLFP Jaffna District MP Angajan Ramanathan as the Deputy Speaker.
When the Government first suggested a member, it is you all who opposed him, not us. When you all objected, we came up with another name. We bowed to your wishes in withdrawing the first candidate. Not that we told the SLFP that we did not want that MP. What we said was that it had to be a back bencher. There was no other SLFP back bench MP remaining in the Government and none of the SLFP Deputy Ministers were willing to resign to take it up. Therefore, we had no option other than to propose someone else from the Government side, the PM responded to Sampanthan.
The Opposition Leader, taking the floor immediately after the Speaker announced that a secret vote would be taken for the Deputy Speaker post, said, We have been working on the basis of a consensus with regard to the election of a Speaker, Deputy Speaker and Deputy Chairman of Committees. In terms of that consensual arrangement, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya was appointed from the UNP and Deputy Chairman of Committees S Adeikkalanathan was appointed from the TNA. The SLFP had proposed a name for the Deputy Speaker.
I urge that we accept that name in keeping with the tradition and work on the basis of consensus. It has been a healthy tradition that had prevailed.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe noted that the consensus was to appoint the Speaker from the UNP, a member of the Government Group as the Deputy Speaker and an Opposition MP as the Deputy Chairman of Committees.
This was different from earlier times when all three members were from the Government. As long as, the nominated member is from the Government Group, it did not matter to us.
There had never been a situation where the Government had to take a minority. Always the Government has had two members and the Opposition has had one member. We are keeping with that tradition, the PM said.
The Opposition Leader before the vote begins once again urged that the matter be reconsidered, despite the initial thinking of the PM and accommodate and accept the SLFP nominee.
Commissions obtained from Norochcholai Power Plant more than $20 Million
Evidence has been unearthed pertaining to the Norochcholai Power Plant suggesting that more than 20 million dollars had been obtained as commissions from foreign companies involved in the construction of the plant, Power and Renewable Energy State Minister Ajith P. Perera yesterday said.
The evidence had surfaced from international investigations carried out on certain irregularities that had taken place when constructing the power plant, he further said. State Minister Perera also said that persons who were involved in such irregularities were enjoying the delay of these investigations. However, enjoying such delays would be possible only for a short period of time, Perera said.
State Minister Perera pointed out that there had been no irregularities recorded in the 11 tenders that had been granted by the present government on the supply of coal to the CEB.
He said that the present government had operated with transparency when granting of tenders, unlike the previous regime.
Answering to a question by UNP MP Nalin Bandara with regard to a company named Nobel Resource Limited, which was involved in supplying coal to the CEB, State Minister Perera also said that US Dollars 366.353 million had been paid to a quantity of MT 4,585,670 supplied by the said company to the CEB without a standard tender procedure.
According to Perera, Nobel Resource Limited has supplied a total quantity of MT 4,585,670 to the Ceylon Electricity Board from 2010 to 2015. He pointed out that the said company had been granted the tender from a special Cabinet approval during all these years, without any proper procurement procedure.
Perera also said that there was an ongoing investigation on the transactions with regard to these coal supplies. CEB trade unions have filed a case at the Bribery Commission on the matter, he pointed out.
Perera said that the operation of the Norochcholai Coal Power Station was interrupted for 24 days, as it had failed to supply coal on time.
The time duration was from September 28, 2011 to October 23, 2011. The loss pertaining to the delay had amounted to Rs. 3,500 million, he said. Another Rs. 12,500 million loss had been recorded due to the same reason during the year 2014 - 2015, State Minister Perera observed. Perera also said that there was no valid agreement with this company pertaining to the coal supply as well.
He also said there are no local representatives separately in respect of tenders numbered LCC/09/T/02, LCC/01 and LCC/13T/01 obtained by the Nobel Resources Limited.
FCID dispatches 101 files to AGs Department after investigations:Minister
The FCID has sent 101 files to the Attorney Generals Department after the completion of investigations, Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara told Parliament yesterday. He was responding to a question by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. He said the FCID which was established on February 24, 2015, had received a total of 336 complaints. However, the minister refused to provide details on the complaints of which investigations have been completed, stating that he could not divulge information before the AG proceeds on legal action. Questioned as to when those files were referred to the AG, the minister replied that he had to take the AGs permission prior giving such information.
Clear division witnessed in JOs voting pattern
A clear division in the Joint Opposition could be seen in the voting pattern at the secret vote to elect the Deputy Speaker of Parliament.
Some JO MPs were seen deliberately dodging the vote by remaining at the Parliament canteen for the entire period of the secret vote which lasted for about one hour and 45 minutes.
Nearly 11 JO MPs were conscious of their absence during the vote and some of them even spoke in Parliament during the oral question round which was held prior to the election.
JO MPs who abstained from voting and remained in the canteen when the voting was in progress were Shehan Semasinghe, Kanaka Herath, Mohan P Silva, Ramesh Pathirana, Kanchana Wijesekera, DV Chanaka, Piyal Nishantha, Kumara Welgama, Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Tharaka Balasuriya and Chamal Rajapaksa. Some other JO members were seen casting their votes.
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa too had earlier been in Parliament, but did not turn up for the vote.
JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena, speaking in the House just before the vote commenced, asked the support of all to appoint MP Dr Sudarshani Fernandopulle as the Deputy Speaker.
Scope of Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act broadened
The scope of the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act has been broadened to include the tracing of crimes committed via internet, information communications technology, cloud computing, blockchain technology and trading in of any digital currencies.
The Government yesterday in Parliament presented a Bill to amend Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act for First Reading.
The Act provides for combating transnational crimes and strengthening the prevention of crimes. The amendment had included new sections to provide for the facilitation of video conferencing technology and joint investigations for the above purposes.
The Bill has expanded the grounds of refusing assistance by including instances where the criminal investigations or proceedings have commenced in Sri Lanka. It has provided provisions to expedite the process of taking evidence or receiving documents or articles for investigations.
A new part has been added to the Act to provide for the assistance in relation to findings of bribery of foreign public officials or officials of public international organizations.
COPE MPs Aluthgamage, Samaraweera not suitable to be in Committee: Ajith P Perera
COPE MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage, Jayantha Samaraweera and Susantha Punchinilame submitted affidavits in Parliament yesterday, stating that they had not received any grant from the Perpetual Treasuries Ltd., or its Beneficiary Owner Arjun Aloysius.
MP Aluthgamage called on other COPE members to follow suit and submit affidavits if they had not obtained any money from Aloysius. He urged to avoid appointing tainted MPs back to the COPE. He went on to say that the CID had questioned the personnel attached to the MSD of 24 MPs over cashing certain cheques.
Intervening at this point, UNP MP Ajith P Perera said that he approved the request to avoid appointing tainted MPs back to the COPE, adding that both MPs Mahindananda Aluthgamage and Jayantha Samaraweera had been indicted by court for misappropriation of public funds and property. They are also not suitable to be in the Committee, he said.
Prime Minister says it is timely that a female be appointed Speaker
While congratulating the newly elected Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that it was time that a female Parliamentarian be appointed as the Speaker of the House. The statement was made in a lighter vein, however with deserved significance.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that UNP Senate Member Adline Molamure was selected as the first female Deputy Speaker in 1955.
We have had a female President, a Prime Minister and a Chief Justice. The position of Speaker of the House however, has been held continuously by males. With the governments policy to promote females in politics, a large number of female representatives are now at Local Government bodies, PM Wickremesinghe observed.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe pointed out that despite the vote for the Deputy Speaker being a politically motivated one, the Deputy Speaker will remain impartial.
The ballot for the post of Deputy Speaker indeed took a political nature. The parliamentarians voted according to their political affiliations. UNP MP Ananda Kumarasiri was elected by a majority. But who we have now is Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, who we all expect to be impartial and just, PM Wickremesinghe pointed out. Premier Wickremesinghe expressed his confidence in Kumarasiri for fulfilling his responsibilities as the Deputy Speaker to its best.
The Prime Minister also commended MP Sudarshani Fernandopulle for her significant contribution and service done to the people as well as in supporting the common candidate in 2015. He also thanked former Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala for successfully fulfilling the duties of Deputy Speaker while he held the position.
Govt. ready to distribute Influenza vaccine at any given time:Dr. Senaratne
The government is ready to distribute the influenza vaccine at any given time; however, we are still awaiting the approval of the National Technical Committee on Influenza to take action, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday.
Dr. Senaratne pointed out that the present government had already allocated Rs. 8,500 million on vaccines given to cancer patients and on stems for cardiac patients, while allocating funds for influenza vaccine was not a difficult task. Minister Senaratne said that the vaccine was already registered in Sri Lanka, but the distribution of it was not his personal call. There area a number of specialists in the National Technical Committee on Influenza, who will decide on the matter, he said. Minister Senaratne also observed that the World Health Organization has commended Sri Lanka for its advanced immunization programme.
Meanwhile, referring to a matter raised by MP Sudarshini Fernandopulle, Minister Senaratne said that he himself did not agree with appointing a medical administrator to the post of Chief Epidemiologist.
A significant drop in the number of influenza patients had been recorded from May 31 to June 3, 2018, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. According to Dr. Senaratne, there had been 2,510 influenza patients reported from Galle, Matara and Hambantota as at June 3, 2018. Accordingly, 930 patients from Galle, 864 from Matara and 716 from Hambantota have been reported. Dr. Senaratne stressed that only 15 deaths had been reported caused by the influenza virus.
Minister Senaratne also said that three additional specialists have been assigned to the Karapitiya and Kamburugamuwa hospitals, while 20 nurses were also assigned to the same.
Cabinet approval had been granted to purchase drugs and other requirements necessary to control the viral flue, without tender procedure. He also said that all requirements to expand the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit of the Karapitiya hospital had been taken by the government as well.

Sealing of TNL tower: Mangala seeks report
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said that he has a sought a report on the matter of the TRC sealing the Polgahawela transmission tower of TNL and that he would apprise Parliament once he receives it.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday when NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa asked as to why the TNL tower has been sealed. The minister said that it was barely an hour since he got to know the incident, and that his attempts to contact the TRC Chairman were not yet successful. I do not like to comment without knowing the real facts. As I could remember it was Voltaire who said, I disapprove of what you say, but I will defend to the death your right to say it. That is the spirit of democracy. Even I regret what has happened, the Minister said.
Sirasa strongly attacked us in the recent past. It heavily criticised the PM and even me, but still I consider Kili Maharaja as a friend. We should be able to keep our politics in one box and our friendships in another box as professional politicians. We must be able to separate the criticisms and friendships, he added.
State Minister Dr Harsha de Silva said, We do not agree with MP Weerawansa very often, but today we agree with what he said. On behalf of our political party, we do not accept this act. Sometimes the media criticizes us and we have to be patient with it. The TRC is under the President. Therefore I would like to remind him that we, in the Yahapalana Government, must be able to create a free atmosphere for the media.
MP Weerawansa bringing the attention of the House to the matter said, The TNL is a media channel owned by the brother of the Prime Minister. It is a recognized media institution. The website of that institution states that the Polgahawela Transmission Tower has been sealed by the Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC). There has to be strong and reasonable grounds to seal a transmission tower owned by a media institution. We do not see such point here. The Government boasted of upholding media freedom. We do not condone this act. It is hard to think that the TRC took this decision by its own.

Several power plants may have to be shut down
The Ceylon Electricity Board Engineers Union (CEBEU) have unanimously decided to intensify their current work-to-rule campaign from today and may have to shut down several power plants starting next week, over the governments failure to address their concerns.
Speaking to the Daily News, Engineer Saumya Kumarawadu who heads the union said that the Executive Committee has decided to refrain from working after office hours.
During the last few weeks although we staged a work-to-rule campaign we still attended to work when the need arose, he said.
From today we will not attend to any work or breakdowns regardless of the situation or circumstance, he said.
He also said that the members have spoken of the many power plants which have both policy and technical glitches adding that they have decided to stop work on those plants from next Tuesday.
This would include Norochcholai and other smaller plants like the Barge Mount, he said.
There are several plants with questionable policy and technical issues that may not function anymore.
Engineer Kumarawadu stated that despite repeated pleas to approve the Least Cost Long Term Generation Plan, the state and the regulator the Public Utilities Commission is yet to agree to it.
What we are asking for is not for our personal gain. The country will be plunged into darkness in a year and the engineers will be blamed. We have decided to make sure our voices are heard so that the general public is aware of the situation.
The Daily News is in possession of documentation which finds that CEB has relentlessly extended power purchase agreements with Independent Power Plants even after the agreements and tenure has lapsed.
This includes power plants such as Ace Power Embilipitiya, Barge amounted power plant to name a few.

Smith cried for four days after tampering scandal
SYDNEY, Tuesday: Former Australian captain Steve Smith admitted he cried for four days after a ball-tampering scandal in South Africa that rocked the sport, as he told children "it's okay to show emotion".
Australian cricket's golden boy was left devastated by the fall-out, breaking down at an emotional press conference on his return to Sydney after being sent home in disgrace. Along with David Warner, he was banned from all international and domestic cricket for a year while opening batsman Cameron Bancroft was exiled for nine months for their part in attempting to alter the ball during the third Test in March.
Part of their punishment includes doing community service, and Smith attended a function at an exclusive Sydney boy's school on Monday to promote a men's mental health charity, where he provided an insight into the toll it took.
"To be honest, I probably spent four days in tears," he told the students, according to the Seven Network which obtained audio of his comments.
"I was really struggling mentally. It certainly was the toughest thing that I've had to do."
The scandal initially unleashed a torrent of vitriol against Smith, but his harrowing and tearful Sydney press conference, where he was comforted by his father, sparked a wave of sympathy.
Smith said he was fortunate to have close family and friends for support, and now wanted to send the message to youngsters that "you know, as a man it's okay to show emotion".
While banned from state and international cricket, Smith is allowed to appear at club level in Australia and in domestic tournaments abroad. He has been training privately and is poised to return to the game at the inaugural Global T20 Canada event near Toronto from June 28-July 15, and said he couldn't wait.
"Two months down and counting," he said of his ban.
"Hopefully by the time I get back to the game I'm fresh and ready to perform at a really high level again."
Warner is also due to play at the Canada tournament while Bancroft is expected to make his comeback at a low-level limited-overs event in Darwin in July. - AFP

Speaker decries fake news
False news reports on unpublished sections of the Treasury Bond Commission report has disreputed the government, Parliament and the country, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya told Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker also said that in the recent past there had been many media reports circulating on the basis of some sections hitherto unavailable in the public domain, caused much inconvenience tarnishing the image of the government, MPs, Parliament and the country.
He observed that it is a very unfortunate situation.
Speaker Jayasuriya informed that he had received 11 pages out of 360 pages of unpublished sections of the Bond Commission report yesterday morning from the Presidential Secretariat.

Speaker should ask for affidavits from MPs on alleged PTL dealings - CaFFE Executive Director
In the wake of allegations that several MPs were given money by Perpetual Treasuries Pvt Ltd, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon yesterday said that the Speaker should ask for affidavits from these MPs stating that they have no dealings with PTL.
Its up to the Speaker to protect the honour of Parliament, so this is something he can do, he said addressing a media briefing yesterday.
Family members and business associates of several previous members of the Committee On Public Enterprises (COPE) are alleged to have received money from W.M.Mendis: Liquor Manufacturers, owned by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL). We know that the previous batch of COPE members had alleged dealings with PTL which had an adverse effect on the credibility of COPE. Now new members have been appointed to COPE, he explained.
The Speaker yesterday received Sections C350 to C360 of the Bond Commission Report from the Presidential Secretariat but not the whole report, Tennekoon however pointed out that the Speaker and MPs have the ability to obtain the full Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) report on Bond Scam through legal means.
In January I have asked the Secretary to the President to release the full report. Since he wanted specific documents I informed him of 13 annexes of the Bond Commission report. Yesterday Presidential Secretariat released some documents. But in those document only annex C 350, which contains the phone calls some MPs had with Arjuna Aloysius and the conversations Ravi Karunanayake and his family members had with the PTL owner, has some value. However the MPs can demand for other documents from the Presidential Secretariat based on information from C 350, he said.
Tennakoon further added that MPs who had continuously criticised former Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake and SLFP MP Dayasiri Jayasekara have shown little interest in obtaining a CID report on transactions made to a large number of MPs.

Sri Lankas ICT sector has potential to reach $5 bn, ceo BoardPAC
Sri Lanka, despite its size, is fast becoming a trending destination for contemporary development. Famed for its Pure Ceylon Tea and widely acclaimed as a tourist hotspot, this island nation is now emerging as one of the top tech destinations in the world.
The country is far from dormant in the IT sector  in fact it is a dynamic force in the business world today, playing a dominant role advancing technology and driving innovation across the world. The environment within which the IT sector operates has never been more conducive for growth. Equipped with the right funding and appropriate investment and support which are now adequately available, I believe Sri Lankas ICT sector can attain the status of a $5bn industry effectively.
At present, the nations IT industry is a vibrant, dynamic business environment poised for progress. As per the data derived from SLASSCOM (Sri Lanka Association of Software and Service Companies), the industry consists of approximately 130 registered companies, composed of a range of large, medium and small enterprises while the landscape overall has exceeded 300 ICT companies.
The Forum will be held at the Main Ballroom of Hotel Galadari Colombo on June 6, 2018 from 9.30 am onwards. The forum will be graced by the Chief Guest, Ranil Wickremesinghe, Prime Minister of Sri Lanka and as the Guest of Honour Prof. Rohan Samarajeewa , Chairman of the Information Communication Technology Agency (ICTA) will deliver the Key note address.
In the sphere of IT, Digital Marketing and e-commerce too is vital to transform Sri Lankan business to a higher level to compete on a global platform. Information technology (IT) has become a not just a vital aspect but a hygiene factor to all business. With constant Invention of powerful online tools and faster internet connectivity has led to a novel arena in commerce related to E-commerce and Digital Marketing which gives a substantial advantage to business organizations to reach global markets instantly and cost effectively.
It is encouraging to note that the Government of Sri Lanka has identified the ICT sector as a priority focus area within the newly established National Export Strategy. The path forward is clear, reinforced by the Governments IT Initiative, a vision to bridge boundaries and propel Sri Lanka into the future. The pledge of Rs. 3bn extended to the sector over the course of the next three years augurs well for national ICT development.
These funds will be allocated by way of grants, equity investments, credit facilities, mentoring, and technical support with the end goal of developing local startups and attract foreign investors.
A further allocation of Rs. 300 million has been made during the current year to implement various activities to promote ICT development through the Export Development Board (EDB).
Understanding the importance of the above, The National Chamber of Exporters has taken the initiative to organize a Forum to highlight and discuss matters such as, Information Technology and Its Role in the Modern Organization, the potential for the Information and Communication Technology (ICT) industry in Sri Lanka, and assistance available to entrepreneurs.
Sri Lanka, endowed with highly skilled professionals and a progressive culture, the country is undeniably brimming with untapped potential.
I believe that by availing ourselves of the unique resources we possess and investing in training and development, our country can achieve exponential growth in the IT sector, both now and in the years to come.

Sri Lanka aiming to capitalise on rare Windies visit
PORT OF SPAIN, Monday: West Indies and Sri Lanka commence one of the most infrequent of international cricket assignments when the first match of a three-Test series begins on Wednesday at the Queen's Park Oval in Trinidad.
More than 36 years since being granted Test status, this is just Sri Lanka's fourth Test tour of the Caribbean and the first involving more than two matches.
On their last campaign to the region ten years earlier, the team led by Mahela Jayawardene claimed their first Test victory in the West Indies in a shared rubber.
Sri Lanka will be keen to extend the form of their last seven matches in which they were beaten just once, away to top-ranked India, and enjoyed an historic 2-0 triumph over Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates while also prevailing at home over an improving Bangladesh side by the same margin in their last Test action in February.
However, their preparations for this series have been hampered by unexpected setbacks involving key players.
Concerns also linger over a number of seniors in the squad who are being managed very carefully with a view to ensuring their readiness for the World Cup in England in 11 months' time.
Opener Dimuth Karunaratne misses the tour because of injury, as do fast bowlers Dushmantha Chameera and Nuwan Pradeep.
Emerging batting star Dhananjaya de Silva was due in Trinidad on Monday having stayed at home when the touring party departed Colombo because of the shooting death of his father, a local councillor in the Sri Lankan capital, the evening before they were due to start the journey to the West Indies on May 25.
It is unlikely that he will be considered for the first Test although he is expected to be back in the key number three position come the second Test in St Lucia and the final match in Barbados, the first-ever day/night Test to be played in the West Indies.
Of the trio of senior statesmen in their side - left-arm spinner Rangana Herath, former captain Angelo Mathews and fast-medium bowler Suranga Lakmal - only Mathews featured in the lone warm-up match ahead of the Tests, a drawn three-day fixture against a Cricket West Indies President's XI highlighted by captain Dinesh Chandimal's assured hundred.
All three are expected to play key roles in the quest for a first Test series triumph in the West Indies although Sri Lanka's selectors have already indicated that concerns over their long-term fitness are likely to result in their being rested for at least one of the three matches.
Despite a poor showing in their most recent Test series in New Zealand last December, the West Indies selectors have retained the bulk of that squad in the expectation of returning to the level of competitiveness they showed in earlier Test campaigns in 2017 against Pakistan, England and Zimbabwe.
Devon Smith, the 36-year-old opening batsman, has been named in the 13-man squad on the strength of a prolific first-class season with the Windward Islands. It remains to be seen if he can earn a spot in the final eleven at the expense of incumbent Kieran Powell and extend a Test career that looked over when he was dropped following the second Test of the home series against England in his native Grenada in 2015. A Queen's Park Oval pitch which has acquired an unfortunate reputation for a turgid surface encouraging neither fast bowlers nor attacking batsmen is likely to result in the sort of dour battle of attrition which will examine both the stamina and concentration of both sides. West Indies cricket remains in an almost perennial state of flux as their star players from the T20 franchise formats around the world continue to be ignored by the selectors, sparking considerable debate within the region, while an investigation into alleged match and spot-fixing by the international news network Al Jazeera has thrown an unwanted spotlight on the Sri Lankan game.

Sysco LABS joins Educate Lanka Mentorship  and Skills Development Program
Sysco LABS has joined Educate Lanka on its Mentorship and Skills Development Program in an effort to support the next generation of Sri Lankas professionals.
This student empowerment program is based on a unique social-private partnership model developed by the Educate Lanka Foundation. It leverages a network of corporate partners and their employees to develop the intellectual and professional capacities of the students who are supported financially through Educate Lankas micro-scholarships.
Sysco LABS joined the mentorship program by pairing its staff members directly with students as they go through a 10-month structured peer-to-peer mentorship course covering a variety of topics ranging from educating yourself on career and tertiary education opportunities, to leadership skills, civics and workplace ethics.
As part of the collaboration, Sysco LABS will also soon be conducting exposure and skills training sessions while offering internship and career placement opportunities for qualified Educate Lanka students and graduates.
Founded in 2007 with an initial aim of preventing students from dropping out before completing their education, Educate Lanka has evolved into a social enterprise driven by a vision of making opportunities universal for everyone and a mission of empowering the socioeconomically disadvantaged children and youth by enhancing their access to education, mentorship, and employment opportunities.
In creating this impact, Educate Lanka employs long-term micro-scholarship funding and targeted exposure, guidance, and training to provide its students with key tools and opportunities necessary to transform themselves into motivated leaders and productive change-makers.
The Mentorship and Skills Development Program is an element of the support Educate Lanka provides to students that goes beyond its financial intervention. The organization looks to professionals from Sri Lankas leading industries as well as Educate Lanka alumni to mentor and train aspiring students on their personal and professional journeys. With Sysco LABS, there are a total of 18 corporate and institutional partners both locally and internationally that have directly impacted nearly 700 Educate Lanka students and students of its community partners through this program since its inception two years ago.
In relation to the partnership, Manjula Dissanayake, Founder and President of Educate Lanka, said, Sysco LABS has been an instrumental partner of Educate Lanka since we first began to leverage the resources of the private sector and the business community in bridging the learning and leadership gaps of our students. As such, we are extremely thrilled and grateful to have their staff join us in providing our students with the 21st century skills, competencies, and exposure that will prepare them not only to meet the future talent need, but also to constructively tackle the challenges of tomorrow.
Sri Lankas workforce and human capital will continue to be tested in a fast-changing world led by automation and artificial intelligence, and its imperative that we proactively and rapidly prepare our youth through innovative and collective approaches so that they could leapfrog into meeting the demands of future work and co-create an equitable and inclusive future for everyone.
On joining the Program Sysco LABS SVP and General Manager Rasika Karunatilake said, We are happy to be able to deepen our support for the Educate Lanka Foundation and connect our employees with the students in the program. It has been a deeply rewarding experience for our team and we would urge other organizations to join the program as well. Academics are vital, they are the foundation that a professionals career is built on, but without synthesis with personal development, its hard to really develop a leader and a force for change. We know this to be true in our organization, and it is a privilege to be able to share it with the students.

Thiem routs Zverev to enter semi-final
PARIS Tuesday: Dominic Thiem reached his third successive French Open semi-final on Tuesday with a 6-4, 6-2, 6-1 demolition of a hobbled and exhausted Alexander Zverev.
Thiem, the Austrian seventh seed, goes on to face either 2016 champion and 12-time major winner Novak Djokovic or Italys world number 72 Marco Cecchinato for a place in Sundays final.
German second seed Zverev simply ran out of gas, paying a heavy price for needing three successive five-set matches to reach his first Grand Slam quarter-final. His Roland Garros marathon also left him physically drained -- he needed his left thigh strapped in the second set.
He is one of the fittest guys on the tour so it was difficult for him today, said Thiem, the only man to have defeated 10-time French Open champion Rafael Nadal on clay this year.
I hope we have many more matches at the Grand Slams but when we are 100 percent.
Its great to reach the semi-finals for a third year but its time to take another step and I will do everything for that. The statistics made bleak reading for Zverev -- he finished with 42 unforced errors and just 19 winners.- AFP

THOSE WERE  THE epic DAYS
The revised and expanded edition of THOSE WERE THE DAYS by Dr. P.G. Punchihewa can help us understand ourselves, our world and even the shattered universe as it stands today. The powerful philosophy of life consistently reminding all takes us to an emotional world around us. He shows us how little stories especially written for children and some for adults, can make the world change. You will enjoy exploring their hidden wisdom and the seriousness found in simple words.
Linguist is the sentiment based upon the affinity of the language seeking expression in terms of power writing, While it equates any language with culture to one's own country irrespective of an intense feel and devotion and love for one's nation, a writer gets trapped in its web. Keeping in view of the psychology and needs of the young, Dr. Punchihewa finds joy in addressing them.
Natural tendency
We are the heirs of a rich and traditional civilization and one of the oldest being ranked third, have been constantly enriched by intermingling ideas stemming from our roots. As we nurture the intellect of our nation, the natural tendency is mostly evident in children and to explore such emotional desire, the writer steps in.
And one such writer is Dr. Punchihewa who awakens the sense of beauty of the past in Ceylon, now Sri Lanka when those were the days and years he encountered in Those Were the Days. However, the book is not all about children's stories and extended to Fiction, Translations, Plays, Travel, and Research. He has also published three of his works in Indonesia in Graded Reading Series called THE BUGGY CART, THE SCARECROW THAT WALKED and COCONUT.
While writing he was mindful of the changing face of Sri Lanka such as the new school of progress and the graphically presented colourful education system. Around this scenario, he gradually built up a stupendous writing career. The impact of resurgent nationalism preceded only to be followed by re-orientation of the young scholar for whom he wrote fables and stories. He has authentically presented such mini sagas after careful examination. A clear example in The Mahi Series surrounding fireflies friends and lastly MAHI. PANCHA BECOMES KING. Yet, the lack of consensus on objectives among writers of his era, trailed behind the other developing countries who were fearlessly loyal to their culture and heritage such as India and Japan where children's literature flourished. It was a handful of juvenile writers like Dr. Punchihewa who fought such a system. He had an eye for a good story that he translated into children's drama and story.
Unusual experiences
During the intervening years Sri Lanka saw an upheaval in Sinhala literature as well as poetry with varied eclectic and exciting range of in repertoire. The hesitant publisher started examining the potential that lay within the folds of such book both for children and adults. Dr. Punchihewa found himself falling in line with this awakening.
Those were the Days is full of unusual experiences he may have come across in his writing career and stood the test of time to become one of Sri Lanka's brilliant writers. Illustrations in caricature by Lalith Senanayake add clout to its contents which he has dedicated to his wife, the beautiful Anoma who by no means an inspiration to his works. THOSE WERE THE DAYS is a fine token as a gift for any occasion and can rest upon a coffee table.
Prolific writer
The author of THOSE WERE THE DAYS needs no introduction to the Lanka reader who at one time or the other has read all or some of his books. He is a prolific writer cutting across many medium for his chosen subject and they turn out to be spectacular and spell-binding and in 2008 the best translation THE SHATTERED EARTH based on his own novel, in Sinhala, GANA BOL POLOWA.
Apart from being a high-profile Buddhist scholar and philosopher, Dr. Punchihewa is much respected member of the Administrative Service of Sri Lanka and looked upon with respect for his honesty, integrity and dedication to his country and the nation at large and stands as a shining example to corrupt officers of the day that we come across all the time. Ten officers of his calibre can pull out Sri Lanka from its dire state to the road of recovery.
After serving almost forty years in senior positions of our country along with an intergovernmental organization in Indonesia as its Executive Director and consultant to the UNDP, he was fortunate in building up close relationships with many highly placed personalities comprising of different socio cultural backgrounds that stood in good shape for him as he waded through his commitments.
A diminutive soft spoken educationist, he obtained his Doctorate in Philosophy and sociology from the University of Sri Jayewardenepura. Earlier an honours graduate from the University of Peradeniya and a fellow from the University of Reading, UK.

The Presidents former Chief of Staff I.H.K.Mahanama and former State Timber Corporation (STC) Chairman P.Dissanayake, who were arrested on bribery charges were further remanded until June 19 by Colombo Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
The Attorney-at-Law appearing for the suspects pleaded that his clients be granted bail on health conditions.
Bribery Commission officials submitted a further report to the Magistrate.
Earlier, the Bribery Commissions Assistant Director General (Legal) Asitha Anthony pleaded from the Magistrate that the audio tapes be directed to the Digital Forensics Institute for verification.
The Magistrate ordered the Bribery Commission to refer those audio tapes to the Government Analyst.
Assistant Director General (Legal) Asitha Anthony appearing on behalf of the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) informed the Magistrate that since the inquiries are not over, the suspects should be further remanded because they can interfere with the inquiries.
The investigation initiated with the complaint that I.K.Mahanama had allegedly demanded a bribe of Rs.540 million from an Indian investor who was ready to acquire a section of the Kantale sugar factory. Mahanama had been attending to this matter of settling the transaction some time ago while he was the Land Ministry Secretary.
However, the Indian investor had refused to pay the sum stating that it was too high and demanded that it be reduced. Within several weeks, they allegedly had agreed to accept Rs.100 million. The two were arrested at a car park of a luxury hotel in Colombo on May 3, by officers of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption, while accepting a bribe of Rs.20 million.
The Magistrate also stated that he would issue an order regarding the bail application at the next hearing and fixed the inquiry for June 19.

Lives of close to 700 families in the Ranwediyawa village in Galewela are at stake with no bridge to cross the Kospotha canal from the village to attend to their daily needs. The bridge built across the canal at great expense was washed away within six months of completion due to the sub standard work of the contractor.The villagers now have to wade through the canal waters even at high tide to attend to their daily chores. A family which had a bereavement recently had to cross the canal in knee deep water to carry the coffin of the dead villager to the Kospotha cemetery. Authorities had allegedly paid dues to the contractor even after the bridge collapsed without taking the contractor to task. They request authorities to take remedial action to provide a quality bridge to end their travails. Picture by Sigiriya special correspondent.

What to do  when you feel inadequate
This week I had conversations with a couple of loved ones who struggle with an inner voice that tells them that something is wrong with them. It made me think about many years where I felt this sense of inadequacy, a deep sense of not being worthy. I still struggle with it sometimes.
This is a particularly difficult problem, because it affects everything in our lives. It causes us to struggle with trust and insecurity in our relationships (personal and work). It makes us less happy with ourselves and more likely to catastrophize when something goes wrong.
This last bit makes it hard when we are working on improving our sense of self-worth, but then we mess up and because we have a feeling something is wrong with us, we are harsh on ourselves and our efforts fall apart.
So what can we do when we have this inner critic, this voice inside us that doesnt seem to feel that were worthy
Theres no magic bullet, but heres what Ive found to help.
Self-Compassion
The first place to start is with the ancient meditation of compassion and loving-kindness. This is because when we have been beating ourselves up for years, theres a deep sense of pain and a lack of kindness to ourselves. We need to reverse this, every day.
So the practice is just to take a minute every single morning (or evening), notice your pain, and silently wish for it to end. Wish for your own happiness. Then do the same for people you know.
For example, you might repeat each of these phrases three times, trying to genuinely feel these wishes in your heart:
May there be an end to my suffering.
May I be happy
Thinking of someone you care about... May there be an end to their suffering.
Thinking of someone you care about... May they be happy.
What youre cultivating is a capacity to care for yourself and others, to be kind, to be friendly and loving. This doesnt immediately cure everything, but its a capacity we dont often have, and by developing it over time, we are developing a new relationship with ourselves (and with others).
You can apply this anytime youre having difficulty as well. Just pause when you notice youre stressed, anxious, frustrated, angry, or hurting. Then wish for an end to your own suffering, and for your own happiness. Several times. With real feeling!
Secret Mantra
One of the biggest problems here is that we have a story we tell ourselves, in our heads, about ourselves.
It might go something like this: Gawd, I keep messing this up. Whats wrong with me I cant do anything right. I suck, I suck. I wish I wasnt so terrible.
Of course, your own story will be different, and you might have several versions of it depending on the situation. But the plain fact is, theres a story we tell ourselves, and its not helpful. It makes us feel bad about ourselves.
If were doing this to ourselves, how do we stop How can we flip the script and learn to be more positive
First, you need to find some gratitude for your amazingness. There is an inner goodness in yourself thats there all the time.
Check on it now: see if you can notice, in the area where your heart is, not only a pain or stress but also a sense of tenderness. This is your tender heart, your basic goodness thats there all the time. (Its OK if you dont notice it right now, check in several times today and see if you can notice that tenderness.)
This is your good heart, the part of you that loves the world, that wants to offer your incredible love to everyone, that wants to be happy and not hurt. Its the part that feels hurts so acutely. Its an amazing quality, and you were born with it.
Find gratitude for this goodness, and for all your other amazing qualities. List the things about yourself that youre grateful for, instead of focusing on the parts you dislike.
Second, come up with a mantra to replace your unhelpful story.
A mantra is something you can say to yourself repeatedly, but especially during times when you need it.
Its a new story, more helpful than the old one. Its based on this sense of your own inner goodness, the gratitude for the amazing qualities you have.
For example, a mantra might be: I have an amazing heart, and the world loves me.
The mantra Ive been working with is: The world craves me and my gift.
It helps, because it shifts how we see the world, shifts how we feel about ourselves. Its based on this place of gratitude and inner goodness, and it radiates out to everything we do. - Zen Habits

Without a book, without a soul
Books are a Passport to the World. That quotation was taken from a UNESCO Poster. Yes, books are a passport to the world! You can travel within the entire world of ours. Or else you can travel to the outer space! Or even else in the Alices Wonderland. Sometimes in the Harry Potters World of illusions! Or you can go a thousand leagues into the Earth itself. So there are no barriers. No need for travel documents.
So how does it happen It all begins at home! This is how Lev Grossman (author, book critic for Time Magazine) described it: My parents were both academics, incredibly austere literary figures. My father was a Poet and Professor of English at Brade. My mother was a Professor at Smith and Brandie's. They taught literature at fancy universities, and literature was a big deal in our house!
Literati
In The Books that changed my life by Bethanne Patrick you can meet Charles Dickens from England, Pushkin or Gogol from Russia Victor Hugo or Guy de Maupassant from France, Tagore or R.K. Narayan from India, Paulo Coelho or Gabriel Garcia Marquez from Latin America - or even Chinua Achebe or Vole Soyinka from Africa - last but the least Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy or Martin Wickramasinghe from Sri Lanka! Or Huslun from China. All from the World of Books!
Moreover, some of these schools offered added attraction of instruction in English, according to The Language of Government (Educational Policies and Progress (1796-1948) by Prof J E Jayasuriya, 1977).
With the advent of the British Rule in Ceylon, the English Language became more or less a socio-cultural phenomenon. With Gutenbergs Printing Machine, the English Language Book Publishing Industry day by day flourished into a media of dissemination of the modern knowledge and the world of literature - to the entire world.
In the British colonies, English became a National Language in official matters.
Book importers
So through this process, till today the English Book Trade plays a prominent role in the Sri Lankan readership. Its appropriate to have a Book Bang of the English Book Trade by a leading firm of English Book Importers in Sri Lanka, the Sarasavi Bookshop Chain. It has been held since June 1 at the Colombo Public Library.

Women  at war
Aristophanes Lysistrata has long been regarded as a modern classic. In Priyankara Ratnayakes production, it seems to expand to fill the vast space of the title role. The iconic study of what anyone could call the clash between masculinity and feminism is set against the epic breadth of the mist-wreathed classical Athens.
Credited for introducing Sophocles to the local theatre, Priyankara Rathnayaka recently took a different route directing Aristophanes' Lysistrata. "So many ask me why I dwell on tragedies. May be because I have directed two tragedies. That is one reason why I wanted Aristophanes' comedy on our local stage," comments Ratnayake.
Rathnayaka teaches theatre at Kelaniya University, the only place which offers it as a separate subject, and leads 'Academic Players' which had won several awards over the years. A theatre festival named after Priyankara Ratnayake will be held from June 7 to 10 at the Lionel Wendt Theatre.
Lysistrata is a comic account of a woman's extraordinary mission to end the Peloponnesian War by denying all the men of the land any sex, which was the only thing they truly and deeply desired. Lysistrata persuades the women of Greece to withhold sexual privileges from their husbands and lovers as a means of forcing the men to negotiate peacea strategy, however, that inflames the battle between the sexes. The play is notable for being an early expos of sexual relations in a male-dominated society. Additionally, its dramatic structure represents a shift from the conventions of Old Comedy, a trend typical of the author's career.
In Greek mythology, Antigone is the daughter of Oedipus and his mother Jocasta. The meaning of the name is, as in the case of the masculine equivalent Antigonus, "worthy of one's parents" or "in place of one's parents".
A Midsummer Night's Dream is a comedy written by William Shakespeare in 1595/96. It portrays the events surrounding the marriage of Theseus, the Duke of Athens, to Hippolyta, the former queen of the Amazons. These include the adventures of four young Athenian lovers and a group of six amateur actors (the mechanicals) who are controlled and manipulated by the fairies who inhabit the forest in which most of the play is set.
The play is one of Shakespeare's most popular works for the stage and is widely performed across the world.
IN ''Asinamali!,'' the first offering of Lincoln Center's monthlong South African theater festival, five black men sing, dance and shout unceasingly for 90 frenetic minutes - almost as if they feared that to stand still might be to surrender or to die. And that may well be the overriding point of this stunningly performed tapestry of satire, tragedy and reportage from the land of apartheid.
What can people do when denied their rights, their dignity, their families, their lives The men of ''Asinamali!'' turn not only their harsh experience but also their voices and bodies, their every sound and gesture, into protest art.
In this kinetic theatrical event, each rapid-fire breath is a volley of defiance against the repressive state.
