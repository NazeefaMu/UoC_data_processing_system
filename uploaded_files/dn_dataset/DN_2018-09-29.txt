Chrysotile Conundrum Clarified
Im writing this in response to the Chrysotile Conundrum article which was published in Daily News  Features section on 07.08.2018.
I regret that the article was written based on a rushed and spontaneous interview which the writer had with myself and another colleague some time ago. And it has been written with the intension of proving a preordained viewpoint of the anti-asbestos factions  both in Sri Lanka and overseas. Unfortunately, it has become a stereotypical trend to concoct material based on hearsay and assumed data, backed by unscientific and unproven concepts and theories to conceal the plain truth.
The article reiterates that Chrysotile imports have escalated to unprecedented levels, and the country is at present the second or third largest Chrysotile importer in the world. It further says that Chrysotile consumption in Sri Lanka during the last few years have increased by 251%. However, based on tangible figures presented by Sri Lankan economists and industry related specialists, Chrysotile imports have gradually declined over the years.
Under Asbestos Exposure, the writer elaborates that diseases caused by asbestos, including Chrysotile, claim the lives of 100,000 people per year, adding that the global death toll may reach 200,000 annually. Regrettably, these figures have been drawn based on an extrapolation of a Finnish study conducted many decades ago, hence, it does not represent exact figures. Regardless to the aforementioned numbers, the World Health Organization (WHO),under its 9th and 10th revision of International Classified Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10), clearly states that Asbestos Related Diseases (ARD) in the world has in fact declined.
The article further excerpts a case study of Australia, and how it has gone to great lengths to resolve the matter. However, it has skipped the essential context which led a massive country like Australia, which once recorded the highest per capita use of asbestos in the world, to ban the material completely. As a matter of fact, Australia imposed a total ban on all types of asbestos on 31st of December 2003. What precedes this action is a shocking revelation about how the country has allowed the use of over 4000 varieties of friable products made of asbestos for many decades. This practice was ensued with catastrophic results in terms of perennial health hazards, pressing the authorities to impose a complete ban on all types of asbestos and take stringent measures to prevent further exposure to airborne particles.
On the contrary, Sri Lanka has from the outset imported and processed only Chrysotile  white asbestos, which is primarily used in the production of roofing related products. The local manufacturers apply most modern technology and innovation to produce high density Chrysotile products, where a thin layer of Chrysotile (2%) is tightly encased within a cement and water mixture (98%)  leaving no room for the material to become friable. In comparison to the condition of Australian plants which contained 400 fibres per cubic centimetre (400 f/cc), Sri Lankan plants contain less than 0.1 fibres per cubic centimetre (0.1 f/cc).
According to a research report published by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO) in 2017 themed Air-Pollution from Chrysotile Fibre in Roofing Products in Sri Lanka, it has been revealed that Sri Lankan plants and houses with Chrysotile roofing that were subjected to the research contained ambient fibre levels. It further testified the amounts were below OSHA (Occupational Safety and Health Administration) Standard of Permissible Exposure Level for asbestos. The NBRO report further underscored that local chrysotile manufacturers, who are members of the Fibre Cement Product Manufacturers Association (FCPMA), have strictly adopted Hatschek technology and has continued to maintain safe use of Chrysotile fibre to minimize the risk of airborne particles.
On a different note, the article also stresses that Sri Lanka uses Chrysotile not only for roofing, but also for other products such as brake pads and insulation material. However, unlike European and Pacific countries that depends heavily on sprayed asbestos for insulation, Sri Lanka has never applied asbestos for house insulation. Nevertheless, asbestos is contained in certain goods imported from the European Union, such as refrigerators, boilers, ovens and incubators. Furthermore, Sri Lanka uses almost all of its imports of Chrysotile (99%) for the manufacture of Chrysotile fibre cement roofing sheets, and only less than 1% is used in the manufacture of jewellery. At present, there are no brake liner manufacturers or insulators in Sri Lanka who applies Chrysotile fibre for their products. This can be further verified from the Sri Lanka Customs import data.
Unlike western countries, Sri Lanka never resorted to asbestos insulation for housing in its colder destinations. Furthermore, the local Sandwich Panel producers never incorporated any type of asbestos in the manufacture of their products. Countries like USA and those in European Union have applied asbestos to heighten acoustics or sound proofing of their studios and manufacturing plants. However, this too has not been practiced in Sri Lanka.

Anton Edema claims that our interview was rushed and spontaneous. Yet, with his permission, I recorded over 75 minutes of our interview, which was scheduled many days in advance with his colleague, Priyantha Jayasinghe from Rhino Roofing, who was also present and participated.
Edema seemed to know about the interview in advance, because he came prepared with several documents and reports to give the Daily News, including the 2017 National Building Research Organization report, and two scientific studies conducted by David Bernstein. A lawyer for the firm subpoenaing Dr. Bernstein in Virginia said, Bernsteins studies are like studies to see if the sun comes up in the east.
HDS Premasiri, the senior scientist for the NBRO who led the 2017 report said, The Chrysotile Information Centre commissioned the study. Premasiri is not trained in asbestos toxicology. The NIOSH guidelines that he used assume that workers are outfitted to manipulate asbestos, with gloves, goggles, masks, and in some cases full body suits. However, in Sri Lanka those are not used in our workplace, said Premasiri. Mainly [workers] are not aware, said Premasiri, since they are mostly working [outside]maybe due to the heat impact as well, they are not likely to wear those things.
The FCPMA and Rhino Roofing declined the Daily News access to their factories.
Premasiri supported the statement of Dr. Amarasinghe, Sri Lankas NIOSH Director General, that asbestos is also present (not manufactured) in Sri Lankan goods such as brake pads and insulation materials.
Premasiri supported health studies on airborne asbestos, saying, no other studies have been done related to asbestos, and actually, we have to do a comprehensive study.
Alleged assassination plot probe on President, Gotabaya: CID engaged in meticulous job - Deputy Minister
Irangika Range
Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said the CID is meticulously investigating the alleged assassination plot on President Maithripala Sirisena and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
He said nobody should come to preconceived conclusions on the investigations.
"We are not detectives to advice the CID. If there are detectives in the Joint Opposition, we urge them to join the CID instead of levelling various allegations and announcing various conspiracy theories,"he said.
The CID has already obtained voice recordings from both DIG Nalaka de Silva and anti-Corruption Movement Operations Director Namal Kumara and we must allow the CID to investigate the matter independently, he added.
Addressing a media briefing held at the UNP headquarters Siri Kotha yesterday, he said that media reports largely highlighted that an Indian national has made various revelations about the allegations of assassination plot. But, later it was revealed that he had no involvement in this matter and he has just gone to meet Nalaka Kumara after this issue was exposed through the media.
However, his own family members reveled that he had a history of mental illness since 2000. But unfortunately media institutions did not give enough publicity to correct this incorrect media reports., he added.
Meanwhile, the Deputy Minister further said that IGP Pujith Jayasundara appeared before a three member committee yesterday to provide evidence into allegations leveled against him.
Commenting on the allegations made by JO with regard to the missing of a sniper rifle belonging to the Police Department, he said no sniper rifle or LMG belonging to the Police had gone missing from the Police Department.
"These weapons are safely stored in the Police Department, STF, Sri Lanka Police College in Kalutara and Colombo Police Headquarters. However, the CID will investigate whether that TID has seized a sniper rifle during its raids, he added.
NTC launches online bus seat reservation portal for long distance buses
Irangika Range
The National Transport Commission (NTC) yesterday, launched an online bus seat reservation portal for long distance private buses.
Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said that commuters travelling long distances would now get an opportunity to book bus tickets online through www.ntcbooking.lk website and through an app.
The minister said that passengers could make use of the facility to reserve their seats on long-distance buses plying on 35 routes, departing from Colombo Fort to several destinations such as Jaffna, Kataragama, Badulla, Ampara, Deniyaya, Passara, Lunugala, Akuressa, Thirukovil, Batticaloa, Point Pedro, Madolsima, Anuradhapura, Dayagama and Trincomalee.
The app could be installed into mobile phones and computers. After an online booking, passengers need to show the seat number to the bus conductor, who will then issue an e-ticket.
He said that it is only a sum of Rs.30 that would be deducted as service charges for online reservations, in addition to the ticket fare.
Due to this service, long distance travellers could be able to book bus seats on long distance private buses to any destination in Sri Lanka from one particular place and receive the details of the bus ticket to their mobile phones to make sure that they would have a safe and comfortable journey.
This is a unique opportunity which would make it easy for passengers to reserve their seats to avoid any hassle and inconvenience to reach their destinations with the comfort, he added.

Most efficient side in the ODIs since 2017:
Afghanistans quick rise in international cricket - brilliance in the field
Fielding and especially catching is one of the most important aspects of the game of cricket. Catches win you matches is the perfect notion which is attached to it and Afghanistan are proving it since 2017.
Even if a team possesses world-class bowlers, they need a support from their fielders after only which the wickets fall.
Afghanistan have some of the best spinners in the world and no wonder they are being supported by their teammates. They are the most efficient side in the ODIs since 2017 with the most number of catches taken compared to other teams.
The fast-improving Asian team has grabbed 116 catches out of 136 with a brilliant efficiency of 85.3 percent. They have beaten the top teams like England and India in this aspect as well and if the team continues to hold on to their catches and with the bowling attack they possess, soon Afghanistan will become a force to reckon with.
The performance theyve put on in the ongoing Asia Cup has been magnificent and they will definitely pull the trigger on a few teams World Cup campaign next year in England.
One of the best fielding sides in the world, India is at the fifth position in this list as they have dropped as many as 51 catches since the start of 2017 in ODIs out of 239 which came their way with an efficiency of 78.6 percent.
Australia, New Zealand and England follow Afghanistan in the charts with an efficiency of over 80 percent in the field.
However, the sides which are currently struggling ahead of the World Cup, rank lower on the list and it proves why they are finding it difficult to find their feet.
Pakistan have dropped as many as eight catches in the Asia Cup and the number increases to 49 when One-Day Internationals since 2017 are considered. They are second worst only behind Windies who have created 155 chances out of which they managed to hold on to only 111 catches. South Africa, Bangladesh and Sri Lanka are the other three nations above Pakistan but even they should improve their standard with the mega event approaching fast.

## Title: Appeal filed by Ven. Gnanasara Thera fixed for October 5

Appeal filed by Ven. Gnanasara Thera fixed for October 5
The special leave to appeal petition filed by Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera seeking an order to set aside the judgement of the Court of Appeal was yesterday fixed for support on October 5.
Supreme Court Two-Judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara and Justice Vijith Malalgoda fixed the matter for another date since the Bench was not properly constituted.
This application is to be taken up before the Supreme Court Three-Judge-Bench on the next date.
On August 8, Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to 19 years rigorous imprisonment, to be served concurrently within six years by the Court of Appeal over his contemptuous behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25, 2016. Through his special leave to appeal application, Gnanasara Thera further sought an order to release him on bail pending the final hearing and determination of this special leave to appeal.
On a previous occasion, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne refused to grant leave to appeal citing there is no substantial reason to consider the application.
Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to a four-year-rigorous imprisonment in respect of the first count. Another four-year-rigorous imprisonment was imposed regarding the second count. Six-year and five-year rigorous imprisonments were also imposed in respect of third and fourth counts respectively.
Gnanasara Thera stated that the Court of Appeal erred in law by dealing with the complaint made by the Magistrate under Article 105(3) of the Constitution, when Section 55(1) of the Judicature Act No. 2 of 1978 provide a special jurisdiction to the Magistrates Court to take cognizance and to punish for contempt committed in the presence of court itself.
The petitioner stated that the Court of Appeal erred in fact and law in convicting the Petitioner for counts 2, 3 and 4 of the charge sheet when the evidence presented by the prosecution did not establish the said counts beyond reasonable doubt.
The petitioner further stated that the judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that it is not lawful to prefer four counts of contempt of court based on different parts of one single incident that took place before the Magistrate and having sentences passed in respect of each such part.
He further said the judges of the Court of Appeal, misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that the sentences imposed in this case are far too excessive having regard to the decision in the case of S.C. (Rule) 01/2004, where a bench of five judges of the Supreme Court imposed a sentence of two years rigorous imprisonment for contempt of the Supreme Court committed for the second time after having issued a severe warning on the first occasion.
He said the judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that the extensive punitive power given to the Court of Appeal by Article 105(3) of the Constitution should be used with caution and deterrent punishment should be imposed when corrective measures are seen to be ineffective as decided by a full bench of the Supreme Court in SC (Rule) 01/2004.
The petitioner further said the judges of the Court of Appeal, misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that the petitioner intervened not on his behalf but on behalf of intelligence personnel of the Sri Lanka Army, if not for whom Sri Lanka would not have won the war against the LTTE.
The petitioner further stated that the judges of the Court of Appeal, misdirected themselves in law by failing to appreciate that the offence of intentionally insulting or interrupting a public servant sitting in any stage of a judicial proceeding set out in Section 223 read with Section 19 of the Penal Code which is an offence akin to the offence contempt of court prescribes only a maximum of six months simple imprisonment or a fine which may extend to Rs. 1,000 or both such imprisonment and fine, when imposing an overall sentence of six years rigorous imprisonment on the petitioner.
He further said the judges of the Court of Appeal misdirected themselves in law by failing to consider that there is a striking discrepancy between the note made by the Magistrate on 25.01.2016 soon after perceiving what happened in Court with his senses on the one hand and the evidence given by the Magistrate, witnesses DSG Dileepa Peiris and lawyer Upul Kumarapperuma on the other hand and that has a bearing on the veracity of the evidence led in this case by the prosecution and as such a conviction based on such evidence is not lawful.
While handing out a 56-page judgement, Court of Appeal Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne had observed that the ingredients of all four charges framed against the accused have been proved beyond reasonable doubt.

Bishan Bedi  they dont make em like him anymore
At a recent cricket conclave in Dubai, Sunil Gavaskar was asked to pick the two best left-arm bowlers he had ever faced. Wasim Akram, who was sitting right next to Gavaskar, was his first pick and the other was his long-term teammate and captain, Bishan Singh Bedi.
On September 25 when Bedi turned 71, his life as a cricketer is a story that deserves to be recounted forever. There are a number of facets of Bedis cricketing journey that make for a fascinating read.
His rise to the Indian cricket squad from Amritsar, to becoming a part of the famed spin quartet of the late 1960s and 1970s is a stuff of legends. His cricketing deeds are known by all, but it is his personality on and off the field which always drew the attention.
TIGERS INFLUENCE
Heavily influenced by the late Mansoor Ali Khan Tiger Pataudi, Bedi flourished under his leadership the most. In fact the spin quartet also consisting of Erapalli Prasanna, Bhagwat Chandrasekhar and Srinivas Venkatraghavan blossomed under Pataudi. Bedi was the one achieved who cult status with his pleasant bowling style, lovely flight, flowing patkas and of course his legendary claps for every six hit off his bowling. In the 1970s Indian cricket, for the outside world, was all about Bedi, along with the batting of Sunil Gavaskar and Gundappa Viswanath.
Bedi was a superstar in his own right. One who played by his own rules, never quite giving a damn. He once got banned by the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) for giving an interview to BBC on the disastrous 1974 England tour!
LEADER OF MEN
When he did take over as captain full-time in 1975-76, there were traces of the Tigers influence there as well. Bedi was one of the boys, always prepared as he was to get his hands dirty. His three years as captain may have lasted just 22 Test matches, but they were the most eventful.
It started off in New Zealand, but his leadership came to the fore in West Indies in 1976 when his batting line-up bore the brunt of their pace battery. West Indies were chastened by India chasing down a record 406 at Trinidad and followed it up with a barrage from their pacemen at Jamaica. India was left with no batsmen with half the side either injured or in the hospital. Bedi declared the innings in protest to protect his spinners.
Later that year he accused England paceman John Lever of using Vaseline to polish the ball during their tour to India in 1976-77. Bedi paid for this accusation dearly. India lost the series, and Bedi lost his Northamptonshire county contract after six uninterrupted years!
His most famous battle as captain came in 1977-78 against a second-string Australia side. India almost chased down 400 plus targets again. India let slip an opportunity to chase down the massive targets twice in that series, to eventually lose it 2-3. It was then considered a missed opportunity for India to win a series in Australia.
His final moment as captain came in Pakistan in that graveyard of a series for the spin quartet. Bedis action to concede an ODI, with India needing just 23 runs off 14 balls, to protest against Sarfaraz Nawazs bouncers, earned him the notorious tag of being the first to do so.
But Bedis leadership left a mark. Someone like Kapil Dev would later write about how Bedis ability to break ranks endeared him to the younger lot. He was always someone who was ready for a fight.
PERSONALITY CLASHES WITH GAVASKAR
Bishan Bedis tendency to never hold back was most visible during his playing days. He never got along with two strong personalities and both incidentally from Mumbai, Ajit Wadekar and Sunil Gavaskar. In the 1970s, parochialism was at its peak in Indian cricket and so where you came from defined your place in the sport. Bedi had open disagreements with captain Wadekar on the 1974 England tour.
Bedi and Gavaskar never saw eye to eye on a number of topics. They had immense respect for each others cricketing abilities, so much so that Bedi named his first-born son off his first wife from Australia, Gavasinder Singh. But like it happens with two champion cricketers, their personalities varied and so they never got along.
Bedis playing days ended when Gavaskar took over as Indian captain on a full-time basis in 1979. Later, when Gavaskar was sacked and reinstated as captain, Bedi was a national selector. Finally, Gavaskar resigned as captain in 1985 primarily because some (read: Bedi) in the selection committee were baying for his blood.
Years later in 2007, Bedi called Gavaskar a destructive influence on Indian cricket!
Cricket circles had immense and blind respect for him (as a cricketer) and he successfully used this to ensure that board officials remained in awe of him, Bedi told Outlook. He wants the glamour, the position and if there are any financial gains so much the better ... but he does not want any accountability. Hes always liked power without accountability.
I had a lot of time for his batting but never as a thought leader, added Bedi. You tell me what his contribution has been. He is destructive, there is nothing positive.
NEW ROLE FOR A NEW GENERATION
Even when he was called in as cricket manager in the early 1980s on an ad-hoc basis, Bedi was famous for his maniacal fitness sessions. He placed a huge premium on sides being fit.
When India finally went in for a full-time team coach or cricket manager as they were called then in 1990, Bedi was the first choice. Indias young captain Mohammed Azharuddin and Bedi hit it off instantly. India had chosen a young and inexperienced Team of the 1990s to be guided by Bedi on that tour of New Zealand. Bedi made instant headlines even as cricket manager, when he suggested that he could get the entire squad thrown in the Pacific Ocean! This was in response to the side failing to chase a modest total against Australia in a tri-series game on that tour.
He then undertook what is still considered one of the best training camps before the England tour that followed with total focus on fitness.
On the tour itself, Bedi openly disagreed with Azhar on his decision to make the home team bat first at Lords in the first Test. That Lords Test of 1990 is now famous for the then England captain Graham Goochs 333. India lost the Test and the series 1-0. Azhar and Bedi had a massive fallout, so much so that the Indian captain said that the team did not need any coach or cricket manager.
CAUSTIC TONGUE
Bedi reappeared as coach of Punjab, Delhi and Jammu & Kashmir Ranji sides. He was most successful with Punjab as he guided the side to a Ranji win in 1992-93. He had various run-ins with the association officials across the three states mostly because he was outspoken.
He was also unsparing in his comments about Sri Lankan spinner Muthiah Muralitharan, often commenting about his action. Bedi would liken Murali to a javelin thrower and say all his scalps were actually run-outs. Murali threatened legal action, but never actually followed up on it. Legal bowling actions was a topic dear to Bedi and he considered the issue as the biggest topic afflicting the sport, bigger than even match-fixing. He even took on Harbhajan Singh for his action.
His battles to get the Delhi and District Cricket Association (DDCA) administration cleaned up later became the goal of his life. He even stood for DDCA presidential elections but failed to get elected.
Bedi has also not been very complimentary about Twenty20 cricket, especially the Indian Premier League (IPL). Though he did make it to an IPL game when he was being felicitated with a lifetime pension by the BCCI.
Whenever a crisis hits Indian cricket or the sport in general, Bedi is often the first voice of dissent that emerges. He is prepared to call a spade and a spade that perhaps is his biggest calling card.
Its a life well lived and it is a gift for our times that he graced the cricket grounds across the globe.  thequint

BMS storm into third consecutive Campus Cricket final, defeating Karachi
Home team Business Managment School (BMS) stormed into their third consecutive Red Bull Campus Cricket championship final, defeating Karachi University by eight wickets in the World Final playoff, at the SSC in Colombo. BMS had been defeated by Karachi at the round robin stage, but had several key players absent for that game, due to Mercantile cricketing commitments. Back to full strength in this knockout match, BMS bowlers first kept Karachi to 142 for 8, as seamers Janith Liyanage and Chamika Karunaratne took two wickets apiece. That Karachi even got themselves to a respectable total was largely down to their in-form No. 3 batsman Arsalan Farzand, who hit 53 off 43 balls, in an innings that featured one six and six fours.
Although BMS lost opener Madushan Ravichandrakumar in the first ball of their innings, Hashan Dumindu - who has been in excellent touch throughout the tournament - and Pasindu Lakshanka quickly set about putting the chase on track, as they produced an 80-run second-wicket stand in the space of 65 deliveries.
Lakshanka then went on to post a further 63-run stand with Liyanage, which propelled BMS to victory in 18th over. Lakshanka stayed not out on 75 off 60 balls, having struck four sixes and six fours.
BMS will now play the unbeaten Marathwada Mitra Mandal College of Commerce (MMMC College), of Pune, in the final on Saturday. BMS were the runners up in the 2017 Campus Cricket World Final, and champions the previous year. This will be MMMC Colleges first appearance in the tournament final.
Karachi University 142/8 (Arsalan Farzand 53, Khurram Shazad 34, Chamika Karunaratne 2/26, Janith Liyanage 2/33)
Business Management School 143 for 2 in 17.3 overs (Pasindu Lakshanka 75 not out, Hashan Dumindu 35, Muhammad Asad 1/20, Hamza Qadir 1/17)

BOOST FOR INDUSTRIAL SECTOR
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the Government is currently discussing bringing in several pieces of new legislation to give special tax incentives to the industrial sector, to set up a logistics centre and an offshore financial centre.
He said that Sri Lankas first-ever Digital Economy Strategy has now been drawn and is before Cabinet for approval.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the inauguration of a two-day forum to mark the International Day for Universal Access to Information at Mount Lavinia hotel yesterday.
The PM, while stressing that the Fourth Industrial Revolution is based on knowledge, pointed out that the Sri Lankan Government has made many commitments to promote knowledge industry and open access to information. The journey has begun, he remarked.
He also highlighted the need to bring in a digitalization law to make all Government bodies comply with the Governments initiatives to promote digital technology and set timeframes for such transformation.
Cabinet has been discussing the prepared Digital Economy Strategy over the past few weeks and hopefully it will get the Cabinet nod next week, he said.
The Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Ministry, with the support of McKinsey and Company began work on the strategy in December last year.
McKinsey and Company in its first report said that Digital Economy could uplift the countrys GDP by 1-3 percent in 2019. The strategy will focus on ways the Government, businesses and the community can adjust to seize the benefits of digital transformation.
The Prime Minister also said the legislation on setting up a Logistics Centre and an Offshore Financial Centre is now being discussed.
The Logistics Centre is in line with the countrys aspirations to be the logistics hub in South Asia and will be located within the proposed Western Megapolis. An offshore financial centre is a small, low-tax jurisdiction that provides corporate and commercial services to non-residents in the form of offshore companies and the investment of offshore funds. The Colombo Port City has been planned as an offshore financial centre.
Telecommunication and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, UNESCO Delhi Office Director Eric Falt and UNESCO Knowledge Societies Division Director Dr. Indrajit Banerjee also spoke.

Avant-Garde corruption case:
CA further stays magisterial proceedings against Gota
The Court of Appeal yesterday further extended its Interim Order staying the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court proceedings pertaining to Avant-Garde corruption case filed against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
This order will be effective until December 5.
The Court of Appeal made this order pursuant to a revision application filed by Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa.
The Bribery Commission had filed a corruption case against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others for allegedly causing a Rs.11.4 billion unlawful loss to the government when giving permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Limited to operate a floating armoury.
The Court of Appeal observed that the Colombo High Court Judge had interpreted a non existing section of the Bribery Commission when he delivered an order regarding the revision petition filed by Gotabaya Rajapaksa.
The matter was fixed for argument on November 30.
Through this petition Gotabaya Rajapaksa is also challenging Colombo Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by Gotabaya Rajapaksa regarding the Avant-Garde corruption case.
In his revision petition, Gotabaya Rajapaksa has challenged Chief Magistrate's decision to refuse preliminary objections raised by him and Chief Magistrate's decision to fix the matter for trial.
On a previous occasion, the Colombo High Court had turned down a request made by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and seven others that they be released from a corruption case filed by the Bribery Commission over Avant-Garde incident.
Rajapaksa is also seeking an order to set aside the Colombo High Court's order dated February 2, 2018.
The Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed this case against eight accused including Gotabaya Rajapaksa under Section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the accused had had given permission to Avant-Garde Maritime Services (Pvt) Limited to operate a floating armoury between August 7, 2012 and January 8, 2015 in violation of laws by providing unlawful income to this private company, amounting to Rs.11.4 billion.
President's Counsel Romesh de Silva under the instructions of counsel Sanath Wijewardena appeared for the petitioner.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Bribery Commission.

Canada strips Suu Kyi of honorary citizenship
CANADA: Canadas Parliament has voted unanimously to effectively strip Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi of her honorary Canadian citizenship over the Rohingya crisis.
Ottawa had given the long-detained democracy advocate and Nobel laureate the rare honour in 2007.
But her international reputation has become tarnished by her refusal to call out the atrocities by her nations military against the Rohingya Muslims minority, which Ottawa last week declared a genocide.
In 2007, the House of Commons granted Aung San Suu Kyi the status of honorary Canadian citizen. Today, the House unanimously passed a motion to remove this status, said Adam Austen, spokesman for Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland, on Thursday.
A brutal military campaign that started last year drove more than 700,000 Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar into neighboring Bangladesh, where they now live in cramped refugee camps  fearful of returning to mainly Buddhist Myanmar despite a repatriation deal.
Many have given accounts of extrajudicial killings, sexual violence and arson.
The military has denied nearly all wrongdoing, justifying its crackdown as a legitimate means of rooting out Rohingya militants.
But after a fact-finding mission, the United Nations on Thursday set up a panel to prepare indictments against Myanmars army chief and five other top military commanders for crimes against humanity.
Suu Kyis democratically-elected government remains in a delicate power balance with the generals, whose presence in parliament gives them an effective veto on constitutional changes.
Austen cited Ms. Suu Kyis persistent refusal to denounce the Rohingya genocide for the withdrawal of the Canadian honour, which is symbolic and comes with no special privileges.
We will continue to support the Rohingyas by providing humanitarian assistance, imposing sanctions against Myanmars generals and demanding that those responsible be held accountable before a competent international body, he added.
Honorary Canadian citizenship has only been granted to five others including the Dalai Lama, girls education advocate Malala Yousafzai and Nelson Mandela.

The changing media landscape
The 20th Anniversary of the Colombo Declaration on Media Freedom and Social Responsibility which was signed by The Editors Guild of Sri Lanka together with the Newspaper Society of Sri Lanka and the Free Media Movement is now being celebrated with a series of events and seminars. Among the international organisations that supported the Declaration were the World Association of Newspapers, the International Press Institute and the Commonwealth Press Union.
This document, revised in 2008 on its 10th anniversary, was a landmark achievement for the media in Sri Lanka that contained a series of proposals, suggestions and recommendations for uplifting the media and the profession of journalism. The developments arising out of the Colombo Declaration also paved the way for self-regulation of the media and the establishment of several industry bodies including the Sri Lanka Press Institute, the Sri Lanka College of Journalism and the Press Complaints Commission of Sri Lanka. The Declaration created wider awareness on the importance of media freedom in democratic societies.
The media landscape here and abroad has changed drastically over the last 20 years. The local media, both print and electronic, have faced many trials and tribulations in these two decades. There have been many positive developments as well. The 10th anniversary of the Colombo Declaration coincided with the beginning of one of the darkest chapters for the media in Sri Lanka, with killings of several journalists including Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickramatunga and physical assaults on many other journalists recorded. Some journalists who were white vanned have never been seen again, including Prageeth Ekneligoda. Speaking at a Colombo Declaration event in Colombo on Thursday, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, alluding to these events, said the media must keep the debate alive on such horrific attacks on journalists and attempts to stifle media freedom.
Media freedom cannot be considered in isolation. It is part of a bigger picture that encompasses freedom of expression, human rights, independence of the Judiciary, law and order and the right to information. The media can thrive as an independent entity only if these basic tenets of good governance are ensured. This is exactly what the present administration has done. To its eternal credit, there have been no attacks on journalists in any part of the country since January 2015 and media freedom has been recognized as a key component of Governance. In fact, Sri Lanka has climbed up rapidly in Press Freedom indices announced last year. The Right to Information (RTI) laws too are among the most progressive measures ever taken by any post-independence Government.
But press freedom is only one part of the equation. The media today operate in an extremely challenging environment. The print newspaper industry is hampered by the high cost of newsprint, dwindling advertising revenues and readers switching over to alternative forms of media consumption such as the Web. Many newspapers around the world have either closed down or downsized (sometimes literally from broadsheet to tabloid).
However, some newspapers have managed to defy these trends and managed to improve their circulation on both print and digital platforms thanks to quality output and reader engagement. Every newspaper is now available digitally, but most readers will keep away if there is a pay wall, unless the content is exceptionally good.
The electronic medias main problem seems to be the relentless rise of the Web as a news medium. There is no longer any need to sit in front of the TV set as news is streamed live to ones smartphone 24/7. The likes of Facebook and Twitter have become de facto news providers to many people who now shun newspapers, TV and radio altogether.
But herein lies another danger. The social media have given rise to the phenomenon of Fake News  falsehoods (text, pictures and videos) that look like the real thing. It is rather easy for anyone to publish false information on Facebook, which can then be shared by thousands almost instantly. This can even lead to social disorder and communal disharmony, as seen in the incidents at Digana a few months back. Facebook and other social platforms have since agreed to vet the posts for any incendiary content, but it is very difficult to impose any kind of censorship or control on a sprawling medium that has no physical or virtual boundaries.
It is very difficult to spot the truth in an era of alternative facts and truth isnt truth, but the mainstream media must fight back by being incisive, in-depth and inclusive. The truth often becomes a casualty in the fight for breaking news in the heat of the moment but newspapers still do have a major role to play. People still want insightful and truthful analysis of news, which is the forte of print media.
There is a healthy debate on whether the print media can survive the digital onslaught at least for the next 50 years. But one thing is clear: the thirst for accurate news and quality journalism will not disappear. In other words, it is not the medium of delivery that matters  what matters now and in the future is good journalism.

Historys longest blockade
In history blockades have been transient features, often associated with war. The blockade of Cuba by the United States is an exception. Imposed in 1962, it has been in existence for nearly 60 years continuously and regularly increasing in its ferocity.
It is not merely an economic blockade. It is much more comprehensive. It is a package of punitive measures in economic, political and cultural relations. To give a simple example, a Cuban child was prevented from receiving a Japanese camera as the first prize won in a competition. It was because the blockade prevents goods having a 10 percent input of US manufactured parts cannot be sent to Cuba. Even countries that deal with Cuba are penalized by the United States by seizing their bank accounts and by other measures. For that purpose, it has passed extra-territorial legislation in violation of international law. Ships reaching Cuba are barred from entering US ports. Even cultural and scientific delegations are prohibited to visit Cuba. Restrictions on travel to Cuba are regularly tightened for US citizens.
These restrictions of trade, travel and investments hurt not only the Cuban economy but also that of the United States. That is why there is a strong movement in the US for lifting the unjust blockade. The blockade prevents Cuba from obtaining even medicine for the sick.
The loss to the Cuban economy from the blockade has been estimated by United Nations officials to be US $ 130 billion.
It is intended to strangle the Cuban revolution and effect a regime change. The blockade is supplemented by overt and covert attempts at regime change, including armed aggression and electronic warfare. Accompanied with them is a media war and funding dissident groups.
Since 1992 the United Nations General Assembly has been passing a resolution calling for the ending of the blockade. It has been passed with more votes in succeeding years. Last week it was passed with two countries voting against and 192 voting for. The same resolution will be taken up for discussion and voting in early October.
Addressing the UN General Assembly this week Cuban President Miguel Diaz Canel Bermudez said that the blockade seeks to suffocate the Cuban economy in order to generate hardships and disrupt the constitutional order. It is a cruel policy, punishing Cuban families and the entire Nation.
It is the most comprehensive and long-standing system of economic sanctions ever implemented against any country. It has been and continues to be a major obstacle to the country's development and to the realization of the aspirations to progress and well-being of several generations of Cubans.
It is time to say once again NO to the US blockade of Cuba!
UKs Labour seeks new direction in development
Jeremy Corbyn, Labour Party leader has unveiled plans for a new direction in running the economy with a Green revolution. The new policies include nationalisation, which until recently was anathema to most mainstream politicians, a drastic extension of workers involvement at the top of companies, a rollout of green technologies, including 13,500 onshore and offshore wind turbines, solar panels on thousands of roofs and wide-scale home insulation.
The whole edifice of greed-is-good, deregulated financial capitalism, lauded for a generation as the only way to run a modern economy, came crashing to earth, with devastating consequences, said Corbyn addressing the Labour Congress.
But instead of making essential changes to a broken economic system, the political and corporate establishment strained every sinew to bail out and prop up the system that led to the crash in the first place. People in this country know  they showed that in June last year - that the old way of running things isnt working any more, he added.
Another new policy is to extend the governments 30 hours of free childcare scheme to the parents of all two, three and four-year-olds, which would benefit more than a million children. Families on the lowest incomes would be eligible for additional subsidised hours of the 30 hours, which would be free for them and cost no more than 4 per hour for those on the highest incomes, with a sliding scale in between.
Key policies include income tax rises for the richest five per cent of high earners, scrapping university tuition fees and the nationalising of water and energy companies, the rail network and Royal Mail.
All primary school pupils will receive free school meals and class sizes will be reduced to less than 30 for five, six and seven-year-olds. Statutory maternity pay will increase to 12 months and paternity leave will double to four months, along with an increase in pay.
If Labour wins the next general election in Britain the neo-liberal paradigm is likely to meet with an existential threat.

How poor technique contributes to majority of running injuries
Of Britains more than 2 million recreational runners, around 1 million are falling injured annually with 500,000 off the road at any one time.
A recent study from The University of Salfords Running Performance Clinic has found that many running injuries may be influenced by simple technique errors.
The study published in the American Journal of Sports Medicine looked at the technique of runners who were injured with common complaints such as runners knee, shin splints and Achilles tendinopathy compared to injury free individuals.
These running injuries are some of the most common injuries experienced by runners and can lead to considerable time off the roads explains Ph.D. researcher and Physiotherapist Chris Bramah, author of the research.
For any runner, time off due to injury is incredibly frustrating. What we wanted to do with the study is identify whether there were aspects of running technique that may be contributing to these injuries. If so, we can hopefully use this information to help runners recover from injury and prevent future injuries happening.
The team used 3-D infrared cameras to analyse the running style of 72 runners suffering patellofemoral pain (runners knee), medial tibial stress syndrome (shin splints), iliotibial band syndrome, and Achilles tendinopathy. They then compared their technique to that of 36 runners who had never suffered a common running overuse injury.
What they found among those injured were common biomechanical patterns that were different to the injury free runners. These included an outstretched leg and high foot angle at initial contact, as well as greater forward lean. But the biomechanical pattern most strongly associated with all the injured runners was side to side pelvis drop, otherwise known as contralateral pelvic drop.
In this case, the team found that for every 1 increase in pelvic drop (above the healthy runners average), there was an 80% increase in the chance of the study participants being classed as injured.
What we think may be happening, is that these postures are increasing stress through the entire body, and it is simply the weakest link in the chain that becomes injured first. explained Chris.
Chris currently heads up a specialist 3-D running gait analysis clinic at the Manchester Institute of Health and Performance while overseeing the Universities Running Performance Clinic and says that these findings are helping to improve the runners they see. What we are finding in the clinic is that simple changes are having a big effect for the runners we see. Not only have we been able to help runners recover from injury, but we have also seen some people go on to run PBs!
The team is now exploring possible solutions such as whether increasing step rate (cadence) can offset risks of injury.  MedicalXpress

Identify players for World Cup, support them: Kumar Sangakkara
Former Test captain Kumar Sangakkara has urged the Sri Lankan team to rethink its strategies moving forward after the teams failed campaign in the six-nation Asia Cup tournament.
The five-time winners crashed out in the first round after humiliating defeats at the hands of Bangladesh and Afghanistan.
We need to find out whether we have the right strategy in place. Whether we should change it or stick to it. Results on tours are important, but the larger picture should be the 2019 World Cup. We need to have a settled batting lineup. We need to identify the openers, identify who our number three is going to be and who is going to bat at number six and things like that.
Those players whom we have identified need to be given an extended run. You need to have specific chats with players explaining what is expected of each of them.
Some of the changes that Sri Lanka did during the Asia Cup like reversing the roles of Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera backfired. While Mendis opened the innings, Perera batted at number four. Mendis was dismissed without scoring on both occasions.
The confidence levels drop if they are moved up and down. You need to identify the engine room of the batting lineup from number one to four and others should play around them. With two new balls, your openers are vital. Number three and four are very important as well and they have to shoulder most of the burden in batting.
Then, of course, number five and six, they need to be able to accelerate and, in case if theres a top order collapse, they should be able to steady the innings. They need to clarify the roles and have an idea what is required of each player, Sangakkara said.
Why they have inconsistent results is that they are yet to get settled. They need to build a team culture, a team strategy. They need to persevere with a set of players consistently for the biggest tournament in cricket.

IGP questioned by Special Committee
Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara was questioned yesterday by the three member Special Committee appointed to investigate allegations leveled against the IG that he had obtained a bribe of Rs. 12 million from a former Principal of Trinity College, Kandy in 2008.
Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Maddumabandara had appointed this three member Commission comprising three senior administration officials, Additional Secretary to the Ministry of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Mala Basnayake, Additional Secretary W.A. Dharmasiri and Director Combined Services Aloka Bandara. Mala Basnayake heads the Committee.
The Committee commenced its investigations yesterday, while the IGP was called before the Committee and questioned for around three hours, recording his statement.
The Law and Order Minister noted that his ministry expects to conduct a fair and impartial investigation into these charges leveled against the IG.
A complaint was lodged with the Bribery Commission alleging that Police Chief Pujith Jayasundara had obtained a bribe of Rs.12 million from a former Principal of Trinity College, Kandy in 2008.
At that time, Jayasundara was the DIG in charge of the Central Province when the ex-Principal Robert Gilbert was deported by courts, but he had been in hiding in Kandy, according to reports.
A person by the name of Nishantha de Alwis had stated that Jayasundara had allegedly obtained the money promising not to arrest Gilbert.
Despite a court order, Gilbert is said to have come to Sri Lanka and attended the wedding of his son at a hotel in Kandy.
It was reported that the alleged bribe was handed over by way of a cash cheque dated 20 August 2008 to Jayasundara from account No.180837076 maintained at the HNB Kandy branch by persons connected to Trinity College.
However,the IGP had refuted these allegations and called for the charges to be investigated.

India retain Asia Cup with thrilling last ball win
DUBAI, Friday  Bangladesh fought tooth and nail to win their first Asia Cup but Indias experience helped them in the end to pull off a three-wicket win off the last ball and retain the title which they won in Mirpur in 2016 by eight wickets - when it was staged for the first time in the T20 format - in the final played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Friday.
A maiden ODI century from opener Liton Das saw Bangladesh to a moderate total of 222 all out. It was a score which India would have overhauled on any given day. But Bangladesh fought like tigers and kept on picking wickets with no one making any substantial contribution.
Skipper Rohit Sharma made 48 and Dinesh Karthik and MS Dhoni scored 37 and 36 respectively.
When Kedar Jadhav was forced to retire hurt with a hamstring injury India required 56 off 12 overs. It was not that Jadhav who was hopping between wickets wanted to leave the field but he was asked to return by signals from within the Indian dressing room because his handicap was depriving India of valuable runs.
It was a good move by India because Bhuvneshwar Kumar no rabbit with the bat who replaced helped Ravindra Jadeja to run the important singles and twos that finally carried India to victory with a partnership of 45.
Although both were dismissed 11 balls of each other Jadeja for 23 and Kumar for 21, Jadhav returned to bat with his leg heavily strapped to guide India to a thrilling win off the last ball.
Bangladesh threw away a golden start to be dismissed for 222 after being put into bat first.
Making a surprise move Bangladesh promoted off-spinner Mehidy Hasan to open the innings with Liton Das and the move proved to be a master stroke as the pair gave their team a dream start by putting together 120 off 125 balls. But once India had made the initial breakthrough by dismissing Mehidy for 32 in the 21st over the rest of the Bangladesh innings fell apart and they were able to manage only a further 102 runs before they were all out.
It was a disappointing end to what promised to be a good total around 300 plus the way Das and Mehidy went about the Indian bowling initially. They provided Bangladesh with their first century opening stand in 27 ODIs.
Das led the Bangladesh charge with a inspiring innings reaching his maiden ODI century off 87 balls with 11 fours and two sixes out of a total of 145.
But the fall wickets at the other end slowed him down and he was eventually dismissed for 121 scored off 117 balls being sixth out at 188 in the 41st over. He was given a life at 52 when Chahal running back from midwicket spilled a top edge.
Following Mehidys wicket, India pulled back the game to pick up four wickets within the space of 43 balls for 19 runs as the Bangladesh innings went into decline.
Both Mushfiqur Rahim and Mahmudullah the two experienced batters in the side in the absence of Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan (both injured) disappointingly holed out in the deep falling to catches by Bumrah and being dismissed for single digit figures.
Soumya Sarkar who dropped down the order tried to get the innings going but after a stand of 31 with Das which was the only other partnership of note in the innings he too found the going tough as the scoring rate dipped dramatically from a healthy six an over to a moderate 4.
It was the Indian spinners who caused the Bangladesh rout and the Tigers were not helped by the result of three run outs which was a result of India plugging the run rate.
Bangladesh went 10 overs without a boundary thats how much India took control of the game. The quite period was broken by Sarkar swinging Jadhav across the line for a six over mid wicket but those were only brief moments of the innings where Bangladesh sparkled.
Once the middle order was dismantled by the spinners the opening bowlers returned to put a quick end to the innings.

Lanka Backs Trump message against Globalism
Politics have no relation to morals - Niccolo Machiavelli
President Sirisenas address to the United Nations General Assembly this week came on a day that saw Presidents Donald Trump of the US and Emmanuel Macron of France give stunning and hugely contrasting messages to the world, and raised new concerns about the trends in international relations.
With the UNGAs traditional first day speaking opportunity for the Sri Lankan leader, President Sirisena did carry a message that sought opportunities for Sri Lanka to resolve national issues without interference or undue foreign influence. His call to look at Sri Lanka in the current post-war context from a fresh perspective certainly has a ring in the current political context in Sri Lanka. It shows the political impact of the UNHRC resolution that was adopted in 2015, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, in the post-conflict situation. It had an emphasis on peace-building and reconciliation, as well as necessary action against any persons associated with war crimes and war-related human rights violations.
His statement that as an independent country we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us. Sri Lanka is taking action to consolidate peace and forge ahead to develop the economy, and deserves the support and understanding of the international community. We want to appeal to the international community that the right of the Sri Lankan people to find solutions to their problems should be respected, has more than echoes of those who are strongly opposed to the UNHRC Resolution, and see it as foreign (mainly western) interference in Sri Lanka, after a long fought war against separatist terrorists. He did underscore aspects of reconciliation and peace-building that have been carried out by the present government. The other important aspects include, the Right to Information legislation and the overall freedom to the media, the wider freedom to the judiciary, and the definitive action on Missing Persons.
President Sirisenas statement that as an independent country we do not want any foreign power to exert influence on us. Sri Lanka is taking action to consolidate peace and forge ahead to develop the economy, and deserves the support and understanding of the international community. We want to appeal to the international community that the right of the Sri Lankan people to find solutions to their problems should be respected, has a dual content. It is both an appeal to the international community, and a recognition that Sri Lankas declared commitment to Human Rights and against War Crimes has necessary acceptance of the international communitys interest in this regard.
The call by President Sirisena for the world to possibly look away from Sri Lanka in the current situation certainly had an echo of President Trumps earlier statement at UNGA that America is governed by Americans. We reject the ideology of globalism, and we embrace the doctrine of patriotism. His call to be free of foreign interference may also ring with Trumps strong opposition to and rejection of the UNHRC. But, the reality is that although Trump is critical of the UNHRC, the resolution on Sri Lanka has been adopted by other members too, as well as the co-sponsorship by Sri Lanka, with the US. It is certainly a situation where apart from appeals to the world, Sri Lanka certainly has to make clear presentations that on matters on alleged War Crimes and Human Rights violations, Sri Lanka does stand free and outside any possible serious allegations. The failure to take action on Lord Nasebys statements on the actual number killed in the final stages of the war against the LTTE, as well as the records on the numbers still held in detention on the Prevention of Terrorism legislation, does raise issues that Sri Lanka cannot simply push aside by making calls to be allowed to resolve national issues, without foreign influence.
There certainly was an outright support and praise for the Armed Forces who carried out the defeat of the LTTEs separatist terrorism, and safeguarded the unity and sovereignty of the country. President Sirisena was certainly speaking with a reverberation of the national gratitude to the Armed Forces. However, it does raise questions in the context of his recent and continued criticism, and even objection, to senior personnel of the armed forces being brought to court on matters relating to crimes and violations of the law, which raises questions about the countrys commitment to the genuine democratic process.
Paris Accord
While Trump politics will not be supportive of President Sirisenas call on the Sri Lankan situation, he certainly did make an important contribution in the call on Climate Change and the Environment. His call for implementing the Paris Agreement on Climate Change for the benefit of humanity and all other living beings, and the call to give utmost priority to these endeavours, was wholly supportive of French President Emmanuel Macrons own call at the UNGA for maximum support for the Paris Accord. In a speech that was sharply opposed to President Trumps line on Climate Change, President Macron even said that no trade agreements should be signed with countries that rejected the Paris Accord. Sri Lanka was in effect more supportive of the European thinking on current democratic trends, and certainly away from the US thinking on matters such as Climate Change and wider international trade.
It will be in the coming weeks to see how much of President Sirisenas UNGA statement is the policy of the coalition government, considering the divisions between the UNP and SLFP on most policy matters. This relates to the UNPs support for the UNHRC Resolution in 2015, seen as the major cause for the change of international opinion on Sri Lanka, after the isolationist policies of the Rajapaksa regime.
Politics of conspiracy
The investigations by the CID into the allegations of a plot to assassinate President Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is certainly at the crux of politics today, but with curious twists and turns, that pose serious questions on the core of the allegation. The buzzy story of the alleged plot extending to others in the Rajapaksa family certainly brought a new feel to the story, with more political ramifications, but it has certainly been shot down, with the alleged informant, an Indian citizen, now known to have been mentally ill. The CID certainly has a tough task with the political flavour of the story, especially with the Joint Opposition seeing in it a new push through in the politics of distortion. Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera has requested the media to exercise caution when reporting on criminal investigations with serious implications for the security of the state. He says the publicity about the extension of the alleged assassination plot are false, baseless and inflammatory.
While the media has the call for greater search for accuracy in reportage of this and similar stories, there are major questions about the conduct of the IGP in this regard, and the necessity to compel him to send the alleged suspect DIG on compulsory leave. The politics of conspiracy is such that there are now divisions both within the Government and the Joint Opposition over the conduct of the IGP, which could well lead to a no-confidence motion in parliament against him.
The political situation in the country is certainly one of great uncertainty, with certain delays in the next Provincial Council elections, whatever the Minister of Provincial Councils says about it, and the continuing uncertainty of the candidates for the next presidential poll. Such uncertainty in politics is certainly a breeding ground for the politics of conspiracy, and gives little support for the progress of democracy and electoral politics.
Price-rise politics
The UNP and SLFP, even as disagreeing partners in government, certainly have a major issue to address in the continuing rise in prices of essential commodities. The increase of Rs. 195 in the standard 12.5 kg of LP Gas, would certainly lead to another rise in prices of food items from tea to rice, hoppers, string hoppers, thosai and vadey. It is not the stuff of good governance or consumer-related economics to keep blaming this rupee fall on the success of Donald Trumps economic policies, and his sanctions on Iran, and related issues. The US is certainly a contributor to this situation. But, there must be policies within the affected countries, such as Sri Lanka, to address it in some form.
One must recall how Malaysia acted to offset the dangerous effects of the international economic crisis in 2008, when trouble began with Lehman Bros collapse in the USA. Is there a total lack of policy alternatives to meet this international crisis Is the government not ready to bring down imports of non-essential goods, and luxuries What is the thinking on luxury transport facilities  especially cars for all, including politicians
Is this financial/economic crisis not a suitable time to think in terms of a much more managed economy in the future, moving away from an economy of luxury and waste
The absence of suitable policies in this regard, both among Government and Opposition, certainly makes this an opportunity for new political/economic thinking, which can be the path to a huge political change in the coming months. It is a promise for the future, moving away from the politics of today and the past.

Morkel burst not enough as champions Surrey lose last-wicket thriller
LONDON, Thursday - Morne Morkel's four-wicket haul could not stop county champions Surrey falling just short in their quest for an unbeaten First Division campaign as they suffered a dramatic one-wicket defeat by Essex at the Oval on Thursday.
The final day of the 2018 English season ended in thrilling fashion, with Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate's unbeaten 53 seeing the visitors to victory by the narrowest of margins.
Had Surrey, already crowned champions, triumphed they would have set a new record for the largest first-innings deficit conceded by a winning side in a first-class match.
They had seemed destined for defeat after being shot out for just 67 in their first innings and then seeing Essex pile up 477 for eight declared in reply, with the hosts a then huge 410 runs adrift.
Yet, in a remarkable turnaround, Surrey made 541 in their second innings on the back of hundreds from England one-day opener Jason Roy (128) and Test batsman Ollie Pope (114).
That left Essex needing 132 for victory and they nearly fell short, with former South Africa fast bowler Morkel -- a key figure in Surrey's first title since 2002 -- taking four for 28.
Just when it seemed Essex had done enough to win, there was a late twist when they lost their ninth wicket to a needless run out when veteran Dutch international ten Doeshcate called Matt Coles for a third that was never on and saw his partner run out.
Number 11 Matt Quinn survived the last three balls of a Morkel over, despite a fierce 88 mph bouncer crashing into his helmet, with Essex needing two more runs for victory.
But the 38-year-old ten Doeshcate, arguably one of the best cricketers produced by a non-Test nation, struck Jade Dernbach for the winning boundary in the next over.

MS Dhoni, became only the third cricketer to captain a national team in 200 ODIs. Dhoni, who had stepped down as captain of India in January last year, was handed the responsibility of leading the side in its Super 4 match against Afghanistan in the Asia Cup, as skipper Rohit Sharma was among the five players to be rested.
Australias Ricky Ponting holds the record for playing the most number of games as captain, followed by Stephen Fleming of New Zealand.
Ponting, who led the side between 2002 to 2012, led Australia in 230 one-day internationals, while Fleming wasnt too behind at 218.
Dhoni, arguably known as Indias best captain, is the latest addition to the list. With 110 wins from 199 games before this, Dhoni has a win percentage of 59.57 and during his captaincy tenure from 2007 to 2017, he has led India to wins in all three major ICC tournaments  the inaugural T20 World Cup in 2007, the World Cup 2011 and the Champions Trophy in 2013. Next is Mohammad Azharuddin, who has captained India in 174 ODIs. The next on the list is Arjuna Ranatunga, who has captained Sri Lanka in 193 ODIs. Virat Kohli took over as Indias captain after Dhoni had stepped down, but he was rested from the Asia Cup considering workload management. In his absence, Rohit was named skipper, under whom India are yet to lose a match in the tournament and successfully booked a place in the final.- cricketcountry

Pakistan Cricket Board rejects allegations of unprofessionalism
LAHORE, Friday - Pakistan cricket authorities Friday rejected allegations of unprofessionalism from their former fielding coach Steve Rixon, saying they were surprised by the 'unfounded' attacks.
Former Australian wicket-keeper Rixon was credited with lifting the Pakistan's fielding standards during his two-year contract with the national team, which expired in June this year.
He did not seek a renewal of the contract, and on Thursday blasted the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for being late with payments and disorganised.
"They didn't pay subsidiary staff on time. Everyone was meant to go to the World Cup (2019 in England), which would be the sensible thing to do but not unless they improved their act," Rixon told Fairfax Media in Australia.
"[I told them], 'you guys will make me angrier and angrier, and I don't need it.'
In the interview Rixon said: "If they want outsiders to the country doing the job make sure you look after them."
The PCB rejected Rixon's claims, saying it was "disappointed by the baseless allegations" and that it "enjoyed cordial relations with all current and former foreign staff attached with national teams."
"It comes as a surprise to us that Mr Rixon made unfounded allegations," the cricket authority said in a statement.
"The PCB strongly refutes the allegations made by Mr Rixon in his interview, the foreign coaching staff has full backing and support of the board."
Pakistan has a number of international figures on its national coaching team -- Rixon was replaced by former New Zealand spinner and Scotland coach Grant Bradburn, and the position of batting coach is held by former Zimbabwean batsman Grant Flower. - AFP

Presidential Commission probing alleged malpractices at SriLankan
Rs.500 Mn spent from EPF to purchase SriLankan shares - Witness
Rs.500 million has been spent from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) to purchase SriLankan Airlines shares which belonged to the Emirates Company in 2010 violating rules and regulations, EPF Superintendent, Nalini Malkanthi Bandara told the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Sri Lankan Airlines, yesterday (28).
It was also revealed that this alleged misappropriation of EPF funds had been taking place during the tenure of former Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal. Not even the Cabinet of Ministers, but only the Monetary Board of the CBSL is permitted to take decisions on investing money of the EPF, the witness said.
According to the witness, neither the Cabinet of Ministers nor the General Treasury had given their approval to invest EPFs money to purchase the SLA shares. A Cabinet Paper presented by the former President and then Minister of Finance Mahinda Rajapaksha on May 4, 2010 says that the SLA shares of about 44% owned by the Emirates should be purchased by the BoC and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation but the name of the EPF is not appeared there.
But, a letter dated July 06, 2010 from the Assistant General Manager of the BoC, B.A. Lionel had informed the Funds Management Committee of the CBSL to credit Rs.500 Million to the current account of the Corporative Branch of the BoC to purchase these shares. This was how this deal took place and accordingly, about 1.8 Million shares have been given to the EPF, the witness said.
[EPF total funds top Rs. 2 trillion]
The total funds belonging to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) top Rs.2 trillion and 91.68% of it has been invested in government securities, Superintendent of the fund Nalini Malkanthi Bandara said yesterday.
she further said that 3.37 per cent of the fund has been invested in listed companies, 0.17 per cent in non listed companies and 2.44 per cent in the financial market .
She was giving evidence before the Presidential Commission investigating into alleged corruption that have taken place at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin LankaBandara added that the EPF receives Rs.2.6 billion as monthly contribution from 16.7 million members a month.

The sorrow of Kenyan cricket, once a World Cup semi-finalist
In the 2003 Cricket World Cup, co-hosts Kenya accomplished something no other associate had ever achieved in the past.
Their tournament started with a defeat to South Africa, but Kenya was on a roll after they beat Canada by four wickets.
After defeating Canada, Steve Tikolo and his men with their batting resistance and guerilla bowling attack produced victories over Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.
Kenya stunned everyone when they beat a strong Sri Lankan side by 53 runs defending a low total of 210. After getting a walkover against New Zealand in the Group Stages, the Kenya team qualified for the super sixes, which was an achievement in itself.
In the super sixes, they found themselves to be a bit lucky, but still, they thrashed fellow co-hosts Zimbabwe.
Chasing a modest target of just 134, they beat Zimbabwe by seven wickets with 24 overs to spare and reached the semis despite a loss against the Indians.
They faced India again in the semifinals but couldnt overcome them. They lost the game by 91 runs, but not before they showed impressive resistance. Despite the semifinal exit, Kenya showed real character, fight and determination throughout the tournament.
Unfortunately, Kenya couldnt repeat their magical performances in the next two World cups (2007 and 2011). They managed to win only one match and lost eight matches including some heavy defeats against New Zealand, Pakistan, Sri Lanka and Zimbabwe at 2011 World cup which turned out to be their final appearance at a Cricket World Cup.
They dipped heavily in cricket due to political and economic causes. Eventually, they lost ODI status in 2014 after finishing last in the super six round of ICC World Cup Qualifier 2014.
To add insult to injury, Kenya was relegated to ICC World Cricket League Division Two finishing fifth in ICC World cricket league championship. Things got much worse when they lost their all six matches in ICC World Cricket League Division Two including fifth place play-off against Oman and relegated to Division Three.
After a disappointing campaign, Kenyas captain Rakep Patel decided to quit from captaincy duties.
Along with him, coach Thomas Odoyo and board president Jackie Jan Mohammed resigned from their respective posts.
Odoyo, who was part of the Kenyan team when Kenya played the famous 2003 World Cup semifinal, was utterly gutted with the teams performance in the tournament.
A few months later, Shem Ngoche was appointed as the captain and Maurice Odumbe as the head coach ahead of ICC World T20 Africa B qualifiers. Kenya did well under the new captain in the tournament as they finished first in Africa Eastern subregion ahead of Uganda and qualified for the Africa regional final.
Their next assignment is to be promoted from the WCL Division Three, which is set to commence from November 9.
Clearly, Kenya has failed to live up to their potential and expectations after their mind-boggling performance in the 2003 Cricket World cup.
Nowadays, most people are forced to believe that they just got lucky in the tournament. But people who actually followed the Kenya team know that they played like true champions. Their sizzling performance then serves as a sweet memory in the fading cricketing history of Kenya.  sk

Sri Lanka cricket's lowest point was round the corner
Theres anger and rage at Sri Lankas embarrassing first-round exit in the Asia Cup and the teams horrendous performance was discussed at the Parliament on Thursday with Sports Minister Faiszer Mustapha coming in for intense criticism. He promised to fix the mess but how he does it remains to be seen. The mood is the same everywhere in the country. This is Sri Lankan crickets lowest point.
The five-time former Asia Cup champions collapse wasnt sudden. Their decline has been steady. Last year Sri Lanka suffered a first-ever Test defeat to Bangladesh, lost an ODI series to Zimbabwe for the first time and were whitewashed 5-0 by South Africa, India and Pakistan.
This year, they failed to make it to the finals of the tri-nation Nidahas Trophy conducted to celebrate the countrys 70th year of independence. Just prior to the Asia Cup, they lost a five-match home series to South Africa with two ODIs to spare.
Of the 29 ODIs they played last year, Sri Lanka won only five games and that saw them decline to number eight in official ODI rankings. At one point, they were in danger of not automatically qualifying for 2019 World Cup. In T20 Internationals they are ranked ninth, below Afghanistan. Increasingly you get the feeling that once a proud cricketing nation is going the West Indies way.
This year, out of the 12 ODIs they have played, Sri Lanka have won only five. The margin of defeats have been massive while the margin of victories have been slender.
NO CONSISTENCY
Sri Lankas slump is attributed to several reasons. First, theres been lack of consistency. In the last three years, the team has had five different captains, five different head coaches, four different batting coaches and four different selection committees. At the same time, the board has changed three times. That should give our readers a fair idea about the chaos in Sri Lankan cricket.
The constant turmoil resulted in a constant change of policies and lack of perseverance with players and strategies. Sri Lanka have tried out several opening combinations with little success and often the team has failed to utilise their quota of 50 overs.
Sri Lanka were the pioneers of making most of the Powerplays. The present team doesnt have too many players who can clear the boundaries during field restrictions.
The mid 90s was the golden era of Sri Lankan cricket. When they won the Asia Cup in 1997 comprehensively beating India in the final, Ravi Shastri at the post match presentation asked Sachin Tendulkar what was a safe score against the Sri Lankans. The Indian captain looked around and said, Maybe 1000! Currently, they are struggling to post 150.
It was also on the same tour that Tendulkar went on record saying, I have not seen Don Bradman, but I have seen Sanath Jayasuriya. Those were the glory days of Sri Lankan cricket.
POOR FIELDING
Fielding excellence was something that they were proud of when they dominated the sport. Sri Lanka were easily the best fielding side in Asia in the 1990s and they were on par with the likes of Australia and South Africa in the global stage.
The present team is the worst fielding unit in Asia. They put down four catches in the opening fixture of the Asia Cup against Bangladesh and another dropped catch against Afghanistan and misfields cost them dearly.
Least said about their running between the wickets the better it is with three run outs in two games in Asia Cup spelling disaster. Captain Angelo Mathews was involved in two of them.
WRONG COMBINATION
Sri Lankas successful teams over the years had a seven-four combination. Among the seven batsmen they played, there were two players who could bowl  Aravinda de Silva and Jayasuriya. Their current combination is four batsmen, three all-rounders and four bowlers. That has been one of the main reasons for below-par scores.
Sri Lankas batting efforts throughout the Asia Cup was painful to watch. They were bowled out for 124 in the first game, their lowest against Bangladesh. Against Afghanistan they managed only 158.
Injury prone captain Angelo Mathews at present only plays as a specialist batsman. He manages multiple injuries in the lower body and he is not able to bowl. That upsets the balance of the side. A slow fielder and a poor runner between the wickets, there have been calls back home that Mathews should only play Test cricket.
BETTER IN TESTS
Dinesh Chandimal, the Test captain, has impressed many as a natural leader. Sri Lanka have fared better in Tests in the last 12 months where they have won three series, drawn one and lost one. They are ranked sixth in Tests.
The selectors have named the 28-year-old as the successor to Mathews. However, Chandimal didnt cover himself in glory in the Caribbean where he brought the game into disrepute by refusing to take the field demanding the umpires to show evidence after being charged with ball tampering.
BIZARRE SELECTION
Sri Lankas selections also have been bizarre. Already the team has several slow movers on the field and on top of that they decided to recall 36-year-old off-spinner Dilruwan Perera to make a comeback after more than a year.
Bangladesh were under pressure losing two wickets in two overs and with opener Tamim Iqbal injured, virtually they were three down in the curtain-raiser of the Asia Cup. Then Perera put down the simplest of chances at square-leg with Mushfiqur Rahim on 10 and he went on to post a career-best 144, the second-highest individual score by a Bangladeshi.
Constant shuffling of the batting order has been another area that has cost them. Kusal Mendis has done a decent job batting at number four, but he was made to open in the Asia Cup when they already had Kusal Perera, who could exploit the field restrictions.
Mendis failed to score in both innings and the team never recovered. Most of their troubles are self inflicted.
BIG SHOES TO FILL
The departure of big three  Kumar Sangakkara, Mahela Jayawardene and TM Dilshan in the space of 18 months created a huge void. Those were huge boots to fill. The likes of Upul Tharanga and Angelo Mathews were expected to take up the mantle. But they have failed to show up.
They have also mismanaged their talent. Lahiru Thirimanne was one of the successful players in the 2015 World Cup which he finished with an average of 50. He was also the understudy to Mathews. A couple of poor series saw him being sidelined. Dinesh Chandimal suffered the same fate, but has fought his way back into the ODI side. Thirimanne lost confidence and he is heading nowhere at the moment.
LEADER WITH VISION
Sri Lankan cricket could have been better served with a leader who had a vision. Take the case of Sanath Jayasuriya, who needed 40 ODIs to score his maiden half-century. Ranatunga was under pressure to drop the left-hander.
But he persevered with Jayasuriya and that paid rich dividends. Jayasuriyas 28 ODI hundreds are still the most by a Sri Lankan.

Terror plot charge: Kamer Nizamdeen granted bail in Sydney
A New South Wales University student accused of plotting to assassinate Australian politicians has been released on bail, after an expert found the sole piece of evidence couldnt be connected to him.
Mohamed Kamer Nizamdeen, 25, was arrested in August after a colleague found a notebook allegedly containing details of plans to kill former Austrlaian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his former Deputy Julie Bishop.
Nizamdeen has spent four weeks in jail facing a terror charge - his family and supporters have maintained he is innocent.
The prosecution has become aware that an expert handwriting examiner found an inconclusive result on the relevant entries contained in the notebook, prosecutor Christina Choi told the Central Local Court in Sydney.
Without a conclusive expert opinion suggesting the defendant was the relevant author, evidence for the charge has been significantly weakened. The alleged list of targets also included the former Speaker Bronwyn Bishop, the Sydney Opera House, major train stations and police stations across the Harbour City.
Nizamdeens lawyer said police had conducted eight hours of interviews with the student which also did not uncover anything against the suspect.
Lets be clear, Mr Nizamdeen today was granted bail because the case against him is extremely weak, almost non-existent, his lawyer Moustafa Kheir said.
Kheir said his client wanted to pass on some appreciation for the support hes been receiving.
He especially wanted to pass on a thank you to his colleagues at the University of New South Wales.
Detectives allege the Sri Lankan national was acting on his own, and despite police telling a media conference he appeared to be an Islamic State affiliate, they had not charged him with being a member of a terrorist organisation.- ABC

TISL lauds RTI law
The Transparency International Sri Lanka in a statement yesterday said Right to Know Day which fell yesterday has taken on special significance for Sri Lanka since the enactment of the Right to Information (RTI) law which has enabled citizens to ask crucial questions on how we are being governed.
The statement:
Right to Know Day (28th Sept) has taken on special significance for Sri Lanka since the enactment of the Right to Information (RTI) law which has enabled citizens to ask crucial questions on how we are being governed. To mark Right to Know Day, TISL has launched a complete interactive database of the decisions made by the RTI commission, classified by topic and geographical location, which can now be accessed via www.cd.rtiwatch.lk, our dedicated RTI website.
As we celebrate Right to Know Day, we recognise some of the key milestones of RTI, ranging from citizens receiving redress following RTI requests on corruption within the Vavuniya general hospital to landmark decisions of the RTI Commission on information disclosure by state owned enterprises, such as Sri Lankan Airlines. Looking ahead to October, TISL will be concluding its final submissions before the RTI Commission on accessing the assets declarations of the President and the Prime Minister.
While great strides have been made in using RTI at all levels of public service, be it in the fight against corruption or as a tool to improve public service delivery, citizens continue to encounter resistance and obstacles when exercising this fundamental right. Since the RTI Act came into effect on February 3, 2017, TISL has facilitated the filing of 1,457 RTI applications for the public via the 6 RTI hubs in Ampara, Matara, Vavuniya, Jaffna, Trincomalee and Colombo. Success has varied and at times solutions are provided to citizens, without the information itself being provided.
Whilst this has short term benefits, it is essential that information flows are established through RTI to ensure its long-term sustainability."

War Heroes will be protected, says President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the government is always fully committed to safeguard honour, dignity and respect of war heroes from top Generals to the last private soldier and they would be provided with every privilege.
The President was addressing Sri Lankans living in the United States at the Sri Lanka Permanent Mission to UN in New York on Wednesday.
The President said LTTE terrorists had planned a flight from Tamil Nadu to destroy targets in Colombo as they were on the verge of being defeated at the war front.
He added that he was the senior most politician in the country in May 2009 directing the security forces as acting Defence Minister, in the absence of all other leaders during the last two weeks of the war.
President Sirisena noted that then President Mahinda Rajapaksa, Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickremanayake, then Defence Secretary Gotabaya Rajapaksa and Army Commander Sarath Fonseka were out of the country on reports that terrorists were going to attack Colombo.
He added that intelligence reports said that terrorists were planning to operate an aircraft from Chennai or some other jungle in Tamil Nadu to bomb and destroy targets in Colombo.
I was the acting defence minister for two weeks at the final phase of the war, the President said.
He said that even he did not stay in Colombo and was in several locations outside Colombo in case the tigers attacked Colombo.
He said there were some incidents investigated during the war as well as after the conflict, but they were not related to war and that cannot be described as hunting war heroes under any circumstance. He said it should not be forgotten that one of the expectations during the last Presidential election campaign was that there should be investigations on these stray incidents and the guilty need to be punished.
If there are some more such incidents outside the war field, they also should be brought before the law and such actions would also be an honour for real war heroes.Our soldiers are internationally recognised because such mistakes have been rectified, he said.
The President pointed out that freedom and democracy has been established in the Motherland and not a single journalist was attacked or compelled to leave the country during the last three and a half years.
There are also some victories achieved by the government that are not so visible and the winning back the international support is one such victory, he said and added that his visit to address the 73rd Session of the United Nations General assembly ensured the safeguarding of honour and respect for war heroes.
Although the cost of living has increased due to uncertainties in the international arena the government is taking many steps to enhance living standards of the people.
The efforts made by President Sirisena to protect the honourable image of the Motherland and establish democracy and freedom was highly appreciated by the Sri Lankan community in the United States of America.
The President held a friendly chat with them after the meeting.

Why we need a revolutionary change
At the time of Russian revolution Lenin raises three sharp slogans demanding peace, bread and land.
These were lovely words at that stage in Moscow and Petrogard and have been bandied about in political circles over the couple of months before October, arousing workers and soldiers.
In Russia, peace meant both internal and external. Bread and food took secondary place, first came peace and unity of the country.
In Russia in addition there was needy conflict resolution due to the aggression against Jews; also need of a solution.
Unlike in Germany Russian people were not alienated from Jews; hence Reconciliation has displaced both hate and despise.
In general those who focus on constitutional reform, in particular those who are hell bent on devolution, like to use the word united meaning that devolution does not mean separation. They are happy with maximum devolution in a united country). Now unity (unlike peace and reconciliation) can be legislated. The United Nations for example is made of separate states; but in spite of that unity in that formidable body is largely absent, collective actions have put the world together.
Rule of law
The point here is that words are used in new context altering the meaning; getting the additional meaning concertized and operational on the ground, is tough and takes time. This is how even the word justice should be clarified and understood.
Of course Justice is another lovely word for the oppressed. Obtaining it requires revolutionary systems where truth has a better chance; in other words, an institutional rearrangement as well as a set of procedures including recruitment, training and promotion.
Typically, in this bourgeoisie society those are running for political office and parties/coalitions aspiring to capture political power, only talk about ensuring justice and establishing the rule of law.
Thats a promise but one is under pressure, hence not an easy one. Theres compulsion to analysis of whats wrong with the system; the focus is on the unpalatable outcome of these flaws.
Key stakeholders
It makes for one to move towards radical thinking. Then Beanie Saunders and Jeremy Corbyn emerge! Thus better candidates develop into the natty gritty of it all.
Then they would have to talk about the legal system, separation of powers, the judicial system, the legal profession, the Police and finally the very socio-economic system. This does not require a doctoral dissertation but with attentive study it is possible to point out glaring flaws.
Today there is informal but serious discussion on the merits and demerits of adversarial and inquisitorial systems of justice, the former being what we have whereas the latter was what we claim to had. Both target justice but whereas one does not care of social fallout, the other does.
The argument for retaining the current system is essentially reactionary conservatism and the need of capitalist exploitation- sorry! in fine words- it is remunerative to the key stakeholders in the system. So we have come to this: this is what we have and this is what we will always until the coming social revolution.
Till then, separation of legislative, judicial and executive powers is of course talked about. However, leftists who are not dependent on executive will continue the fight for independent judiciary.
Counter-terror laws
The present yahapalana Government promised to repeal this PTA more than three years ago. But it is still being used and there is no date announced for its repeal. Instead, the Government had engaged in alternate processes to draft laws that would replace the PTA.
Media reports about a draft counter  terror law approved by Cabinet indicates that problematic clauses such as admission of confessions made to Police and enabling the Defence Ministry to be the authority to implement the provisions of this bill as a piece of legislation dealing with national security will be introduced at the Parliamentary Committee stage, eliminating possibilities of judicial review of such amendments. However, a more fundamental question is whether Lanka need any counterterror laws.
There are wide-ranging powers available under the Public Security Ordinance, the possibility of including new offences under ordinary law, powers of Magistrates to deny bail in a variety of situations etc. Counter-terror laws provides the executive and security establishment extraordinary powers with minimal checks and balances as well as discretion usually vested with the judiciary, negatively affecting life and liberty, rights and dignity of persons, often serving as a license for enforced disappearances and torture.
That is why revolutionary change in this country necessary. We must start with a new democratic constitution acceptable to all nationalities in the country. We are told such a constitution is ready. We must rally round the yahapalana regime to establish this democratic constitution.

Youths benefiting from Thurunu Diriya loans
Enterprise Sri Lanka, Bank of Ceylon Thurunu Diriya loan scheme has given potential small-scale young entrepreneurs an opportunity to face financial problems and reach their dream.
Thurunu Diriya loan recipient Sandali Kulathunga, 24, has a plant nursery in Kimbissa in Dambulla. She followed the National Vocational Qualification Level 4 certificate course in Plant Nursery Development at Inamaluwa Technical College and a course in Landscaping and Gardening at Matale District Vocational Training Centre, Dambulla. Later, she started a plant nursery in the 4 acre land of her parents, facing Trincomalee - Dambulla main road, with the guidance of her father, who is working at the Agrarian Services Department. She received Rs. 500,000 from the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme from which she bought a water pump to obtain water from the Dambulla water project, built a hut to keep plants and a small building for business purposes.
I easily got through the process of obtaining the loan and Small Enterprise Development Division (SEDD) was very supportive throughout. The SEDD also conducted a two- day training program to educate entrepreneurs on how to conduct a business. The Bank of Ceylon in collaboration with the Policy Development Office (PDO) of the Prime Ministers Office, the Central Programme Management Unit (CPMU) of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs and the Small Enterprises Development Division (SEDD) of the Ministry of Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development implemented the Thurunu Diriya loan scheme.
It provides loans without a guarantor and collateral or with lenient guarantor conditions for young entrepreneurs, who possess a degree or a recognized vocational certificate and were in the business for not less than three years. Further details of the loan scheme can be obtained from the Bank of Ceylon branches or the Divisional Secretariats island-wide.
