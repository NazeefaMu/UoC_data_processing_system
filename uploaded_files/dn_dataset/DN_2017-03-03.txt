Backdating gazettes on Treasury bonds done since 1997
The backdating of gazettes issued on treasury bonds have been the norm since 1997 and that this alone was not the problem in the Treasury Bond Scam, SLFP MP and Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna yesterday said addressing the media at the SLFP Headquarters.
Alagiyawanna, who was also a member of COPE committee, which investigated into the Bond Scam said, We all have asked that this investigation be done transparently, and we need to create a conducive environment for the Presidential Committee to carry out their work.
He stressed that media conferences and fiery rhetoric on issues such as the gazette would only hinder the work of the Committee.
Since the introduction of Treasury Bonds in 1997, gazettes have been backdated to the previous year. Prior to 1997, the Central Bank would gazette in the manner in which it planned to raise money and the dates on which such transactions are expected to occur on January 1 of that year. But with bonds, it was practically not possible to do that as this would include the issue of bonds.
"So the process which was followed was to allocate a day the year after the financial year in question to issue the gazette. For example, the details of bond issue of 2012, would be released in a gazette in 2013, Alagiyawanna explained.
He, however, noted that there was an anomaly in 2015,
In 2015, January 8, Mahinda Rajapaksa lost, and there was a change in who was the Finance Minister, so there has been a mistake here as they should have issued a new gazette under the new Finance Minister. The issue here is to find out whether a new gazette was not released on purpose or by mistake and then take action, he said.
The SLFP Deputy Minister stressed that the issue of gazettes a year later was not new and that the Committee be allowed do its job. He added that the COPE did not concentrate on this aspect as its report was released on October 28, 2016 and the gazette was released in September 2016.

Hybrid court not feasible: Prime Minister
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today ruled out the possibility of a hybrid court, saying it was not politically feasible.
Instead he proposed a Truth and Reconciliation Commission as the best option to deal with post war issues of the country.
The Premier was addressing the ceremonial inauguration of National Law Week 2017 at the auditorium of Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL).
Wickremesinghe, observing that the establishment of a 'hybrid supreme court' may require a referendum, said he raised this point with the UN Human Rights High Commissioner, as well.
Can you actually establish a hybrid supreme court If you bring in an Amendment for that purpose, is the two thirds majority of Parliament sufficient What if the court decides that it requires a referendum he questioned.
The European Union (EU) itself knows the dangers of a referendum, the Premier added referring to the much talked-about EU referendum which paved way for Brexit.
We will have to seriously rethink it. If the court rules that we must go for a referendum we will end up in serious trouble. Hybrid court is surely not something we can campaign for. It is certainly not practical. We are now looking at a new mechanism. The Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has already been set up and a Special Counsel to be appointed. We are now considering a TRC which I think can resolve many issues. The South African experience, the strengths and weaknesses of that process, will be studied. Generally all parties are in agreement with it in principle, he pointed out.
The Prime Minister pointed out the TRC would be a cornerstone of achieving reconciliation, but at the same time stressed that a basic agreement on new Constitution is needed for the setting up of TRC. He pointed out the extremists in both sides of divide would reject the TRC, adding that the Centre would have to deal with that.
Any criminal procedure cannot be long drawn. It has to be fast. We have fought too long. We have to find a quick way to compensate for those suffered and met with injustice. We have to address the issue of missing persons he commented. 
Wickremesinghe, reminding the debt the country has to repay in the next 10 years, noted the importance of thinking of a mechanism to ensure that the country meets the expectations of the international community.
Referring to ongoing UNHRC sessions in Geneva, the Prime Minister said the Sri Lankan Government is negotiating a roll over in next two years with regard to undertakings mentioned in 2015 Resolution.
The reference to hybrid court was because the people lacked faith on local judicial system, but over the past two years we have restored peoples faith by upholding independence and integrity of court. The smooth transition of Chief Justices was an example. Last week the Constitutional Council and the President worked together for this purpose he added.
The Premier used the opportunity also to congratulate the newly appointed CJ Piyasath Dep, who was also at the head table making his first formal appearance as the CJ, commending him as a person who deserves the position of that high rank. 
The Premier stressing that the independence of the judiciary should not be compromised in any way, observed that the countrys court system is older than political system and that most of the members of the first legislative council were lawyers.
The Premier said the Government is now negotiating with the EU to regain the GSP plus facility, and observed this trade concession was given based on good governance practices. We lost it because there were questions over the independence of judiciary, media freedom and independence of election system over the past years. Last two years we have been able to re-negotiate to regain this concession he said.
Now we have to ensure that our laws are compliance with international standards and international human rights practices he noted.
The Premier also took the opportunity to reiterate his stance over the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR) and its Optional Protocol to which Sri Lanka is a signatory party. Previously I raised the same in Parliament and asked the Speaker to give a ruling. The Singarasa case was a departure of the accepted practice. The judiciary cannot intervene into Parliamentary affairs. However, the ICCPR cannot impose any judgment on us. It can only recommend and it is up to the Government to decide whether to accept it or not he said.

JO should not try to dilute SLFP
The JO should not sling mud at the President and try to dilute the party. If the party is weakened, the victory goes to the UNP as it will be a one horse race, Western Provincial Councillor Gamini Thilakasiri said.
He was addressing the media yesterday at Rajagiriya together with Kotte SLFP organiser Jamaka Ranawaka and Colombo District Organiser Rajitha Kodithuwakku.
He said President Sirisena is a clever visionary leader, who could achieve significant election victories and urged the Joint Opposition (JO) to rally round the President to strengthen the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
Thilaskasiri said the SLFP has no future unless rallying round with the leadership of President Sirisena. If the JO ready to work more closely with the SLFP leadership, it will not be hard to win forthcoming local government and Provincial Council Elections, he said.
He led the SLFP to the victory when he held the SLFP General Secretary post. But the party lost two elections without his support, he said. Speaking on the SAITM medical faculty issue, he said that there should be equal room to access education.
Speaking on the Treasury bond issue, he said, the President has already taken suitable measures by appointing a presidential commission to look into the matter impartially.
Janka Ranawaka said there should be a proper mechanism to curtail drug menace and the under-world activities.
As far as I know, no one can sell drugs without police support and political backing. Both politicians and police should launch a joint approach to do away with the drug and under-world menace. The minister should work on this, he said.
If he cant perform his duty well, he must resign from his post and handover it to any other who can perform. If the police fails to work against frauds and corruptions, the SLFPers will battle against it, he said.
Ranawaka invited the JO to work with the President to form a SLFP government in 2020. He said the President will be requested to contest the next presidential election as SLFP candidate. He said the country needs not a new Constitution but certain amendments to the existing one. Rajitha Kodithuwakku requested the President to take tough action against persons who are acting against the SLFP while representing the JO. Those in the JO are still doing evil things criticising the party and its leadership. We urged the President to take tough action against these persons, he said.

Sri Lanka and India relations strengthened
The historical friendship between Sri Lanka and India has been strengthened under the present government. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe maintain a cordial relationship with India, Labour and Trade Union Relations Minister W.D.J. Seneviratne said.
He was addressing the gathering to mark Sri Lankan and Indian Independence days in Colombo recently.
According to Minister Seneviratne, India has achieved a significant development in various sectors. Sri Lanka as a neighbour, is happy to see the victories of India. India and Sri Lanka gained independence in 1940s. India gained independence one year before Sri Lanka, the minister said.
"The Indian Prime Minister has informed that he will visit Sri Lanka to celebrate the International Vesk Festival. It is a great honour for us," he said.
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu said India will sign more Free Trade Agreements with Sri Lanka to strength economic ties between the two countries.
Sri Lanka has become the second economic and trade partner of India in South Asia, Minister Seneviratne said.
There is a huge demand for Indian vehicles in Sri Lanka, Indian health services and Indian education. Sri Lankans have invested in India in the fields of furniture and tea industry, he said.

Tomb classrooms
Hopeless women are being invited to the grave classroom to experience death - in the hope that it will give them a new lease of life.
Liu Taijie, 30, founded the unique experience after her attempt to take her own life three years ago. She had reached rock bottom after being unable to get a job at the same time her marriage started failing.
But after her recovery, she decided she would use her own experiences to make a difference to the lives of other women. Liu created the grave classroom, which consists of a small piece of open land on a hillside with six shallow graves dug into it.
Women are then invited to lie in the holes and contemplate the world without them in it.
They are also given mindfulness lessons in the grave classroom, and encouraged to regain their confidence and self-worth.
Liu, from Chongqing in south west China, said: I was abandoned by my husband, I was despised by my family. I was deceived by a pyramid selling scam and I wanted to die. Tears are useless and death cannot solve problems. I want to change and use my experience to help women.
As reported by the Peoples Daily China , one emotional woman who had recently used the grave classroom told the camera: When I think of that if I were dead - my parents, my child and my husband... They would not be able to take it.
Liu added: Through experiencing death, I hope to dare them to face life, to appreciate life, to have an optimistic attitude towards failures and towards life and to have a better future.

1st unofficial ODI v England Lions: Two Pereras  Kusal and Thisara excel in Lanka A win
Sri Lanka A drew first blood in the five-match unofficial ODI series when they beat England Lions by 47 runs under the Duckworth/Lewis rule at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday.
England Lions whose target was set at 278 off 43 overs after Sri Lanka had scored 278-7 in 48.1 overs finished on 230-9.
An opening partnership of 123 in 25 overs between Kusal Perera (59) and Danushka Gunathilaka (64) gave Sri Lanka A the platform for their total.
A very sedate Perera took 74 balls to score his runs which comprised eight fours and a six while Gunathilaka had five fours and a six in his 79 ball innings.
England Lions managed to restrict Sri Lanka 191-6 by the 38th over, but another fine partnership of 65 off eight overs between skipper Milinda Siriwardana (48 off 41 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) and Thisara Perera an unbeaten 56 off 35 balls inclusive of five sixes and two fours saw Sri Lanka A to a competitive total.
England Lions needing to maintain a run rate of six and a half an over slid to 133-7 by the 29th over despite a steady knock of 64 off 70 balls from skipper Keaton Jennings.
A partnership of 76 off 11 overs between Liam Livingstone (39) and Craig Overton (60 not out off 45 balls, 3 fours, 2 sixes) saw England Lions put up some late resistance but the asking rate was too much to maintain especially after losing cheap wickets upfront.
The second unofficial ODI is scheduled at the same venue for March 4.
Scores: Sri Lanka A 278/7 in 48.1 overs (Kusal Perera 59, D Gunathilaka 64, M Siriwardana 48, Thisara Perera 56 n.o., T Roland-Jones 2/59, C Overton 2/46, T Helm 2/50)
England Lions 230/9 in 43 overs (K Jennings 64, T Alsop 20, L Livingstone 39, C Overton 60 n.o., S Jayasuriya 2/34, L Madushanka 3/50, A Aponso 2/37)

83rd Battle of the Saints : Peterites have edge over determined Joes

The 83rd Battle of the Saints between St. Peters College and St. Josephs College will unfold with the usual comradeship at the P. Sara Oval today and tomorrow.
Two days of exciting cricket can be expected from these two Catholic schools. Though St. Peters hold a slight edge due to their recent purple-patch leading up to the Big Match St. Josephs will try hard to turn tables and bring back the Rev.Fr Maurice Legoc trophy to Darley Road after eight years.
Rev.Fr Maurice Legoc was the rector of both the schools and the trophy for the Big match is named in his honour. He first served at St. Josephs College and then went onto become the first rector at St. Peters College.
Robert Fernando led St. Josephs College in the first encounter while George Jayaweera led St. Peters College.
Of the 82 matches played between these two great cricketing schools St. Josephs lead the tally with 12 wins while St. Peters has won on 10 occasions with 60 matches ending in draws.St. Josephs last won under the leadership of Ruwantha Fernandopulle in 2008 and St. Peters last win was under Vinu Mohottis captaincy last year.
The highest score in the Battle of the Saints series is by St Josephs when they made 382 in 1982 under the leadership of Ken Serpanchy while the highest Peterite score was in 1938 under Percy Perera where they accumulated 345 runs.
St Peters were bowled out for a paltry score of 36 in 1972 and incidentally that remains as the lowest score in the series and St. Josephs lowest score is 56 in 1938. The highest individual score of the series is 204 by Clive Inman of St Peters in 1954 and the best bowling figures for an inning is 9 for 41 by Shenal Warnakula of St Josephs in 1997.
St Peters led by that dashing right hand batsman cum Sri Lanka under 19 cricketer Lakshina Rodrigo had an excellent season recording five outright wins and are one of the few schools to remain unbeaten as well.
Spinners Ameen Miflal and Chathura Obeysekara have brought many strong batting lineups down to their knees accounting for 175 wickets between them this season. If these two start taking wickets, St. Josephs will have a difficult time.
The two pillars of the Peterite batting are Rodrigo and Santhush Gunathilaka. The latter has scored over 950 runs and will be hoping to reach the land mark of 1000 runs in the all important Big Match in front of a packed house. Rodrigo has scored over 900 runs. They have got their team off to blazing starts many a times and they will be itching to continue the trend this weekend in the most important game of the season.
The Peterites are coached by former Peterite skipper and Sri Lanka player Malinda Warnapura.
Meanwhile St. Josephs will be led by left-arm spinner Hareen Cooray and they have registered three outright wins this season.
Nipun Sumanasinghes success with the bat will be very vital for the Josephian chances of regaining the trophy after 8 years. He is the top run-scorer for the Darley Road boys with over 1000 runs this season. Fast-bowling all-rounder and junior Sri Lanka player, Jehan Daniel will need to shine as he has a niche for performing at big occasions. Cooray has been lethal throughout the season taking over 75 wickets.
Veteran Sri Lanka cricketer cum coach Roger Wijesuriya is the Joes head coach.
With the first-innings restricted to 60 overs per side since year 2000, both these teams will have an equal opportunity to produce a noteworthy team performance and win the game. Most of the matches played at P. Sara Oval have produced high scores even though the bowlers had enjoyed the surface.
Taking all these into consideration, the odds are in favour of St. Peters pulling it off.

Anjula has scored 890 runs including two centuries and eight half centuries and bagged 29 wickets for his team. His highest score is 149 against Prince of Wales College. Deputy skipper Dileepa Jayalath, the highest wicket-taker in the team has claimed 75 wickets that includes a fine spell of 7 for 27 against St. Josephs.
The 5th year coloursman, Sri Lanka Under 19 A team cricketer Shammu Ashan has contributed 450 runs and taken 40 wickets and a lot will expected from him in the Big Match,
All-rounder Asel Sigera has scored nearly 600 runs including a century and four half centuries. He has also claimed 46 wickets and his best performance is 6 for 39 against Trinity College.
Another centurion Supun Waragoda has made 370 runs and bagged 45 wickets. The highest run getter of the team is Sahan Suraweera who has accumulated 1026 runs including one century (135 against S. Thomas College) and four half tons. Right-handed batsman Dushan Hettige has scored 503 runs with a highest of 91 against Wesley College.
The Anandians fast bowling attack comprises three pacemen, two left arm spinners and two off-spinners. Kavishka Anjula, Chamika Gunasekera and Dushan Hettige will handle the new ball with spin support coming from spinners Dileepa Jayalath, Asel Sigera, Shammu Ashan and Supun Waragoda which can keep the Nalanda batting in check.
Former Sri Sumangala cricketer Rohan Soysa is handling the Anandians from past three years with the assistance of Amal Fernando.

## Title: ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE OF LOCAL Government ELECTIONS

ACHIEVE OBJECTIVE OF LOCAL Government ELECTIONS
With the handing over of the much awaited De-limitation Report, small political parties have now renewed their clarion call to hold the forthcoming Local Government Elections on the existing PR system which is their last straw to ensure political presence in the locality.
At the outset, politicians with people at heart must realize that the main objective of holding Local Government (LG) elections is not to test the popularity or unpopularity of their party but to elect genuine, acceptable, decent individuals at Ward/Electorate level, who can serve the society as faciltators of solving problems of people in the locality relating to public service, Local Police and the Judicial service in addition to facilitating the development of the area in conjunction with the Government and recognized Non-government bodies. This is a basic electoral reform that lays the foundation for a robust, productive, political administration structure that cuts down wastage and corruption which have become the bane of Good Governance.
Recently, I happened to watch a late night, Sinhala TV Talk-show in a local channel with the Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils and three other parliamentarians representing the main political parties. According to what transpired, the application of the new Mixed system (to which people have not given their consent at a referendum), will allow 70% to be elected on first- past- the- post basis while the balance 30% would be elected on PR basis after summing up losers votes.
Operational methodology
The proposed introduction of Female and Youth representation at Local Government Level made the discussion more complex and the speakers couldnt convince the viewers regarding the real operational methodology. However, it was stated that, there is a possibility of the present number of politicized Local Government members which presently remains at around 4486, going up by another shocking 2000!
When people ask for rationalization of the existing political machinery to cut costs and improve productivity, the politicians simply ignore the voice of the people and engage in proliferation of the corrupt political industry. Our question is, can the tax-payer afford to sustain this unproductively bulging political fraternity
Colossal debt burden
People have already taken to streets for increasing the VAT from 11% to 14%. The country is bleeding, unable to bear the colossal debt burden left by the previous regime.
In the melee, the politicians are hell-bent on adding insult to injury by increasing their lot who will eventually qualify for duty free luxury vehicles, pension after five years, personal staff and numerous other perks and allowances!
In such a scenario, we as tax-payers, genuinely interested in the development of our country, exhort on the authorities to consider the not too late following steps to alleviate this pathetic development.
1) De-politicize Local Government elections and allow apolitical, independent persons to contest as candidates for Local Government membership not exceeding the present island-wide figure of 4,486.
2) Since the objective is to provide a facilitator/ ombudsmen rather than a politician for the local people to resolve their aforesaid issues, we reiterate that the prospective candidates should be apolitical, honest, decent, social minded persons of high integrity acceptable to the people in the respective wards/electorates.
3) Accordingly, they should register their nominations under the respective ward/electorate they want to represent and the people will vote for the best facilitator for their ward/electorate.
4) Since, the political colour or hue will not come in to the picture, the small political parties need not make an issue and the entire Local Government election should be held on First-past-the-post basis avoiding the debatable, determination of best percentage mix under the proposed mixed voting system.
5) The office bearers at Pradeshiya Sabha, Urban and Municipal Council level can be elected by the ward members by vote.
6) These facilitators will eventually graduate to become proven Provincial Councillors and MPs by becoming members of political parties of their choice.
In our view, election to next upper levels, namely Provincial Councils (PC) and National Parliament should be held purely on Proportionate Representation(PR) system sans the optional Preference Voting mechanism, enabling all voters in North, South, West and East to be treated as Sri Lankans carrying a vote card of equal value untainted by race, caste or religion. Then only can we call ourselves a unitary country where Sri Lankans are its citizens.
This system will guarantee the representation of smaller political parties both at PC and national level. A further step to constitute the National Cabinet also on PR basis will make our country, a model Five-Star democracy!

She was threatened when she went to investigate an alleged encroachment on the Dambulla old cemetery by a person who had trespassed and cleared a part of it, the MP said. He said the police who were at the time had not taken any action.
Addressing a press conference at his residence, Aluvihare said municipal employees staged a demonstration in Dambulla recently against police inaction in this regard.

Aryan wonder
Archaeological evidence reveals that every major civilization has maintained cross-cultural interactions for their survival. Since the era of explorations, migrations, imperial expansions and long distance trade expeditions, invasions seeking spices and raw material and spreading religious beliefs and cultural traditions had laid the foundation in the formation of cosmopolitan societies throughout the globe.
During this era, people representing numerous countries met, mingled, interacted and maintained trade links with each other. These Global interactions had provided invaluable opportunities in sharing cultural, linguistic and religious traditions of other civilizations.
At the same time majority of ancient civilizations disappeared due to natural causes or destroyed and replaced by alien civilizations. This had been a continuous process since the origin of mankind.
Mass exodus of nomadic and pastoral people speaking Indo-European languages identifying themselves as Aryans migrated to the Indian subcontinent. At the beginning, their migration appeared to be an invasion. According to the research findings of archaeologists these foreigners had migrated to the Indian subcontinent around 1500 BC through the passes of the Hindu Kush mountains.
Indus Valley Civilization
According to A L Basham, the Professor of Asian Civilization and the writer of the well- known book The Wonder that was India the great steppe land stretching from Poland to Central Asia was inhabited by semi-nomadic barbarians who were tall, comparatively fair and mostly long-headed. Referring to Indo-Europeans, they migrated in bands westwards, southwards and eastwards conquering indigenous populations and inter-marrying with them in forming a ruling class.
Their migration had coincided with the declining stages of the Indus Valley Civilization due to internecine conflicts and environmental degradations. There could have been instances that the original inhabitants of the Indus Valley clashed with the Indo-European migrants.
Some of the historians of Indology put forward diverse theories on the Aryan migration and interpreted it as an invasion. Aryans had been branded as tribal, martial and pastoral people hailed from Central Asia. They created fear phobia in the minds of the native inhabitants as they drove their horse-drawn chariots across the Indian subcontinent destroying what remained in the Harappa cities and irrigations channels found along their way.
Many centuries after their arrival inter-marriages took place between the Dravidians and Indo-Europeans and the gradual assimilation, the integration and the continuous interaction maintained between both the cultures had a lasting impact on social, cultural, political and religious spheres of the indigenous communities found scattered in the Indian subcontinent.
Mythological counterparts
The Aryans brought with them an Indo-European language known as the Vedic Sanskrit language which was also identified as the sacred and the classical language of ancient India. The descendants of the speakers of Indo-European languages are comprised of the populations of Nepal, Pakistan, Northern India and Bangladesh. In addition to Sanskrit numerous other languages are spoken throughout the northern portion of the subcontinent and on the Islands of Sri Lanka and Maldives.
The Indo-Aryans were responsible in introducing alien religious concepts comprised of a pantheon of naturalistic or functional gods, traditions of ritualistic cult practices , the sacrificial use of fire and an intoxicating drink called Soma.
Soma was a plant believed to be found in the North-Western Mountains and its juice was extracted and used as a stimulant having hallucinatory effects in the Vedic ritual drink especially among the Indo-Iranian priests and an entire book of Rig Veda was dedicated to Soma sacrifice.
Some of the gods mentioned in the scriptures of the Indo-Aryans are also found to have mythological counterparts in other Indo European traditions of Iran, Greece, and Rome. These similarities can be considered as clear indicators of common origin of such gods in ancient times.
Max Muller a German national renown as a Sanskrit scholar, a philologist and a pioneer in Vedic studies maintained that the Aryans had originated in the Central Asia and one branch had migrated to Europe and another band of Aryans settled down in Iran and another segment of the Iranian branch and later moved to India.
Advanced poetic techniques
The Aryans on their arrival in the Indian Subcontinent were engaged in rearing horses, cattle, sheep and goats. Horses proved to be more valuable because horses did not breed in India. The Aryans replenished their supplies of horse meat by importing horses from Central Asia.
The Aryans harnessed horses to carts or wagons helping them in reaching long distant locations speedily. Horse driven chariots appeared to be devastating war machines and effective in creating fear phobia in the minds of the indigenous communities of Indian Subcontinent.
Cattle became the measure of wealth of Indo-Aryans and calculated prices in terms of cattle. Farmers of Indo-Aryans prayed to gods requesting to increase the number of cattle. The Indo- Aryan priests engaged in sacrificial rituals were usually rewarded with cattle for their services.
In addition to the Indo-European concepts of religion of the Aryans , they were also comprised of other religious traditions of indigenous communities in a modified form which they gathered in the course of their eastward migrations. The religion of the Aryans thus developed since their arrival in Indian subcontinent until 500 B.C. was embodied in a collection of Hymns, Ritual texts, and Philosophical treatises called Vedas.
The Aryan priests possessed very advanced poetic techniques which they used in composing religious hymns intended to be sung praising their gods during sacrifices.
Since the era of the establishment of the Aryan settlements the Brahmin priests developed, celebrated and interpreted an elaborate schemes of sacrifices. These priests had settled down mainly in East Punjab in the region between Satlaj and the river Yamuna. Later this region was known as Brahmavarta. Rituals had been conducted on daily basis assuring long life, progeny and prosperity. Their leaders were also assured victory in battle. Indo-Aryan priests also played a dominant role in restructuring Aryan society.
The Hindus regarded the Veda as a body of eternal and revealed scriptures and embodying the essential truths of Hinduism.
Fire sacrifice
Rig Veda is the earliest section of the Vedic Corpus and the composition of the later Vedic Corpus the Sama, Yajur and Atharva Vedas are generally dated to the first half of the first millennium B.C.
Rig Veda is the earliest text of hymns of the Vedic Corpus deals on the Aryan religion. It is comprised of 1.028 hymns and identified as the oldest religious literature in the world. The Veda is known as sruti inspired or heard by ancient seers. The Hindus the world across consider Rig Veda as the most sacred religious text. The deities mentioned in the Rig Veda were personifications of natural forces.
God Indra referred to as  eka deva ( One God) and venerated as pre-eminent and the core myth of Rig Veda recounted his deeds. According to this central myth, creation proceeded when Indra who was considered as the champion of the celestial gods slew a serpent demon known as  Vritra who enclosed the waters and the sun required for the human beings.
According to this myth when Indra split opened the belly of this demon the essentials of creation such as moisture, heat, light were released. Thus the cosmic order rita had been established, under the administration of the god Varuna.
Ritual based on a fire sacrifice personified as the god Agni. The Vedic Aryans lived closed to nature as a part of it. The vastness and the brilliance of nature, its blessings and maledictions, its inexorable and subtly operating law which dominated all its manifestations dominated the Aryan religious ideology. :
The Samhita section of each is a collection of hymns and Brahmanas are detailed explanations relevant to rituals.
The Upanishads and the Aranyakas are philosophical discourse which is also considered as a form of Vedic Corpus.
The hymns were memorized and transmitted orally over a period of many centuries before being committed to writing.

Australian businessman gives evidence against Gammanpila
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, a key witness in the alleged financial fraud case filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila, yesterday informed Colombo High Court that he learned from the Special Investigations Unit (SIU) that Udaya Gammanpila had sold the shares which he had invested in the Pan Asia Bank through a fake Power of Attorney.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were present before the Colombo High Court yesterday, in connection with an indictment filed against MP Udaya Gammanpila for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 20 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction that had taken place in 2000.
Witness Shaddick said that he never had signed a document executing a power of attorney to Gammanpila and therefore his signature had been fraudulently used as an authentic one in order to initiate the above mentined transaction.
In reply to a question raised by Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, the witness said he had never given power of attorney to Udaya Gammanpila. I launched a metal recycling business in Sri Lanka in the early 90s with Sri Lankan businessman Sydney Jayasinghe. Gammanpila served as one of the employees of our company named Metal Recycle Colombo. Subsequently, my wife and I decided to invest shares of Digital Nominees another company belonging to us in the Pan Asia Bank, the witness added. The witness said he has invested a sum of Australian Dollars (AUD) 100,000 in the Pan Asia Bank and further said he had constantly contacted with the Bank officials.
The witness said that he met Udaya Gammanpila as a young student at the Monash University in the early 90s and Gammanpila had won his wifes trust as a genuine Buddhist.
I had a fall out with Sydney Jayasinghe and it led to the collapse of my businesses in Sri Lanka. At that time, Udaya Gammanpila told me that there was a conspiracy to assassinate me by the youngest son of Sydney Jayasinghe. He advised me to be cautious, he further added. Shaddick said that he had left the country 20 years ago and that he was able to lodge a formal complaint with the SIU in 2015. Further trial was fixed for March 14. The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling the shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Ayah & Other Stories : Expect the Unexpected
Juliet Coombe interviewed Sri Lankan travel writer Chanis Fernando-Boisard a fascinating author of an exciting new book just out in all leading book shops Ayah & Other Stories
Chanis Fernando-Boisard is a Sri Lankan writer living in Paris, France whose amusing and thought provoking stories are inspirations from her own extraordinary life travels, superbly captured in Ayah & Other Stories. The stories span settings from 1960s Sri Lanka to the Somalia of the 1980s, and to 21st Century Paris. Writer Chanis Fernando-Boisard explains that Ayah & Other Stories was born out of My poignant memories of a blessed childhood in Sri Lanka and my life in France, in between traversing many places and time-frames the world over.
The writer explains that life is a cycle, one always keeps going back, and in her first chapter, Ayah, the character Asilins chilling warning, about marrying a foreigner and the dangers of living overseas, is dramatically backed up by a lizard cry, which in Sri Lanka is said to be a signal of foreboding and evil. As a young girl Chanis, called Miss Nelun in the book, found this somewhat dramatic event deeply disturbing, but now, looking back with the wisdom of age, she realizes that Asilin had a point; one is best in ones homeland once that inner rebellion is done with. The power of this collection of stories is in the harsh realities of lifes lessons that she succinctly sums up by saying Life is tough, life is unfair; why do some things happen to some and not to others I wonder Then I shrug my shoulders; what good does it do thinking Lets just get on with what has to be done. For Chanis jet setting around the world in the airline travel business showed her how travel and tolerance go hand in hand, the more people nurture prejudices, the more I scorn them.
Worst terrorist incidence
Like most Sri Lankans this enigmatic and deeply spiritual writer is very wary of the dangers of black magic and her superstitions are threaded throughout the book brilliantly brought to life in Chapter 6 Living with The Huynhs, From where I come, they say that hair is a perfect conduit for bad luck, spells and charms, which is why I have become so careful when cleaning my hairbrush or cutting my hair. Living overseas in the West has not changed her views on the spirit world as highlighted in the chapter about a house she lived in We who have lived in this house know that it conceals a hint of madness in its walls and corners. The bathtub on the first floor overflows for no good reason; in the basement pots of food burn to charcoal. From an early age Sri Lankan parents have their childrens fingernails cut and burnt to stop them being used in spells to put on them.
Like the stories, Chanis has a femme fatale quality to her writing in which the expected ending is twisted, like in Ayah when she is told of Asilins death on her wedding day, instead of breaking down into tears, she quietly and firmly asserts without even a tear in her eyes: Will someone hand me the jasmines, please.
I dare however anyone reading this book not to shed a tear or two by the end of it for Guillaume in particular whom in the last chapter one fears attended the football match at the Stade de France on that bloody Friday, November 13, one of France worst terrorist incidence in 2015!
As the final page of Ayah and Other Stories was edited the authors dad died suddenly and I asked the writer if this unexpected tragedy would trigger an early return to live once again in her home country This quietly rebellious writer responded, I am not ready to go back.

CB Additional Director Statistics says: Former Governor walked into Public Debt Dept. when auction was underway
Former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran walked into the Public Debt Department when the controversial Treasury bond auction was very much underway, Dr. M.Z.M. Asim, the Additional Director of Statistics Department of the Central Bank said.
Dr. Asim also said that during his office as an employee in the CBSL, he had never experienced an occasion where a CBSL Governor visited the Public Debt Department (PDD) when a treasury bond auction was taking place at the department premises.
Asim also said his seniors also observed that they have never encountered an incident where a CBSL Governor walked into the PDD on an auction date or during an auction time under any normal circumstances.
He was answering a question directed by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Navana, as to who visited the PDD on February27,2015, when and where the questioned treasury bond auction was held.
Responding to the question, Dr. Asim said the former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran visited the PDD around 10.45 a.m. in the morning while the questioned auction was taking place during 8.30 a.m. to 11.00 a.m on the said date.
Dr. Asim, who was one of the then Additional Superintendents of the Public Debt (ASPD) during 2015, was testifying at the Presidential Commission to investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds yesterday. Explaining the occurrences followed by the arrival of the former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran, Dr. Asim said that he and his colleague ASPD U.L. Mutugala, accompanied Mahendran into the office of the Superintendent of the Public Debt (SPD) C.M.D.N.K. Seneviratne.
Two of the Deputy Superintendents of the PD also followed in with me, Asim also said.
Asim as requested by the Commission went on to explain how former CBSL Governor, after proceeding into SPD Seneviratnes office where the SPD was present, sat on the sofa in the room and recollected how the latter started to inquire on three specific matters. First, the former Governor inquired on the auction details which was currently taking place. When he inquired about the auction details, the SPD Seneviratne responded that the aucion details cannot be provided since the auction was yet on. Seneviratne said to the former Governor, that she would be able to provide auction details once the auction finishes. Asim said.
Asked whether Mahendran should have had a general knowledge about the auction details, Asim said that to his knowledge the former governor must have known the auction details.
The second inquiry made by Mahendran was the details on a meeting which was held on the previous day of the said auction date, regarding the additional governments borrowing requirements.
Asked whether Mahendran mentioned on what the additional government funding was required for, Asim said he recollects Mahendran to mention that the fund requirements were pertaining to road development activities. The third query the CBSL Governor made was on the modality of funding practiced at that time, Asim further said. To that effect the Former Governor mentioned his preference for auction base financing method. I did not read into his preference whether it was a personal one or not. he said.
Asked whether he detailed the former Governor on the auction details, Asim answered in the negative.
Asim then went on to say that he left the SPDs office in the middle of the conversation as the Head of the Front Office went into the said office.
The discussion between the SPD and the former CBSL Governor did not reach any conclusion at the point which I left the office room. It was only a general discussion. Asim also said. Asim said, after a while, he saw Mahendran walking out of the SPDs room around 11.11 a.m.
Asked on when the auction matter closed, Asim said it ended at 11.05 a.m.
After the auction was over, Mahendran left to the C1 Conference room for a meeting, Asim told the Commission.

Religious places cause no discord among ethnicities
There was a past when religious harm had been almost unheard of. Enter Mahinda Rajapaksa, and then we came to know of religious discord. Now, this is quite ironic, as religions are meant to offer solace to humans not otherwise. The Buddhists, Muslims, Christians and Hindus got along quite well in the past.
Sri Lanka was under the rule of the great statesmen such as Don Stephen Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake, Junius Richard Jayewardene, Ranasinghe Premadasa and Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. The communal hatred never reached press. The temples, churches, mosques and kovils had never faced any threat. The communities had no reason at all to fight among each other. Religious sanity prevailed more than enough during the tenures of these statesmen.
Of course there could be malpractices going on in these religious places. However, what we must keep in mind is that the people visit these religious places. The people visit these religious places especially because they need peace of mind. It is not humane to create discord in places where helpless humans seek mental solace.
For some unseen reason, the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidency paved the way to religious discord. Let us forgive whoever, be it Muslim clergy or Buddhist clergy, carried out religious discord and move forward with the true meaning of religious reconciliation.
Let every human in this country have a chance to follow the religion of their choice.

A commendable act
The government should be commended for handing out one of the largest, if not the largest, monetary compensation on behalf of a civilian who had died at the hands of a state organ. The next of kin of each prison inmate killed during the police shooting in the prison breakout on November, 2012 is to receive Rs. 2 million and those of each injured victim Rs.500,000.
True, no value can be attached to a life, a prisoner or otherwise, and it will be small consolation to the relatives and loved ones of the victims. But given the dire circumstances of the families of the prisoners who perished, the substantial compensation indeed would be like a god send to them. These prisoners had their own families, children etc. who obviously were being maintained by illegally earned money such as through drugs and extortion. It is hoped that their children, at least, would be put on the correct path with the aid of the substantial compensation, if not already gone astray themselves. If this could be achieved, the compensation would have been put to productive use and, what is more, would have prevented the progeny of the victims going the way of their fathers and ending up in prison.
It would better if the prison authorities take some measure to ensure that the compensation money is put to right use. Rs. 2 million would no doubt be a mind boggling sum to these folk who belong to the lumpen strata who have never dreamed of setting eyes on such an amount, let alone possessing same. The tendency would be to spend this money on the same nefarious activities engaged in by the departed victim. If so, the money would not only be a waste but also recipe for disaster, in that it would spawn another breed of lawbreakers and perhaps criminals.
The aftermath of the horrendous prisons massacre was laid out in all its gory details that saw adults and children weeping and wailing at the scene.The incident was the blackest episode in the country's prisons history, perhaps second only to the Black July prison massacre that brought international condemnation on the country. Both chapters were closed, with no one brought to justice or held accountable. Both attacks had the makings of having been orchestrated.
In the Black July incident, Sinhala convicts were provided with knives, katties and other blunt weapons to get about their business, that saw a gory ending, with over 50 Tamil inmates butchered to death. Nobody took responsibility or was held accountable. In the recent incident too no heads rolled. On the contrary there were attempts to justify the massacre, with a Senior DIG, close to the Rajapaksas, eagerly giving out a list of the inmates killed, which included the names of notorious criminals, as if to justify the sordid operation. Both episodes are only distant memories today, what with the feeling conveyed to the public that it was good riddance.
The government should strive to get to the bottom of the 2012 prison massacre because there were rumours that were then in circulation that the breakout was stage managed in order to get at some selected inmates who knew too much of the doings of a powerful bureaucrat.
Be that as it may, our prisons need a complete overhaul and badly so. The whole system is corrupt and rotten to the core. It is no secret that there is subterranean world within the prison walls akin to the underworld outside. Prison officers, from top to bottom, too have become an integral part of this subterranean world catering to the needs of selected inmates.
What is therefore needed is wholesale reform. There is talk that our prisons are to be made more congenial correction centres like those in the developed countries. Already, one such cantonment, on these lines, have already been completed in Angonapelessa in the deep south and was slated to have been opened by the President, who however had demurred and instead said he would rather open schools than prisons.
A case against Big Matches
Leading prelate of the Jathika Hela Urumuya and Founder of the Sri Bodhiraja Foundation, the Ven Omalpe Sobitha Thera has taken his campaign to extremes and threatened to go court to halt Big Matches which he claimed was the platform for youth to get inducted to alcohol and tobacco. The Ven. Thera said he would move court against the police and school authorities for not banning Big Matches. It is not clear when the Ven. Thera is planning to file his court case, because, the Big Match season is already in full swing and the Battle of the Maroons, which was the bone of contention, due to the recent clash between groups of students of the two schools, is set to begin tomorrow. Besides courts cannot rule on moral issues and could intervene only if there could be a breach of the peace. Big Matches, though, have come to stay, with even some of our Lord Justices, enthusiastic participants in the fun.

Compensation for Htota land acquired under last regime
Compensation will be promptly paid for the lands acquired for the Hambantota Port Development Project during the last regime, Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranathunga said.
According to him measures have already been taken to compensate people who lost their lands due to the Hambantota Port Development Project, in the next few days.
Minister Ranathunga stressed that land owners suffered a lot over the years as the former government did not compensate them. It has been obesrved that most of the families of these land owners do not have a proper shelter since they lost not only the lands, but their houses too.
Accordingly, the government has allocated Rs. 2 billion as compensations to the community, whose lands were taken over for the Hambantota Port Development Project. Minister Ranathunga who advised ministry officials to expedite the compensation scheme, said that these funds should be handled with transparency without letting any room for injustice.
The governments primary objective is to pay a fair amount of compensation to these people based on the valuation of the property. Furthermore, all possible steps will be taken to enhance the living conditions of the entrepreneurs, who lost their lands and businesses due to the port development project the Minister added.
The First two stages of the Hambantota Port project has already been completed on a land area of 1,115 hectares. Most of this land extent acquired from the project were private lands.
Through the funds allocated by the Treasury, we have paid compensation in respect of 237 lands which were assigned to Hambantota Port development project by considering the valuation of the land area, the minister said. Under the compensation scheme, 75 per cent of the estimated value was paid for another 129 lands at a cost of Rs.892,532,701 allocated by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA). The balance will be paid to these land owners in the near future, he said.
In addition, we will develop the road network to access these lands and provide free water and electricity to these lands, which were given by us. These tasks will be carried out with Treasury funds. A majority who lost their lands due to project are poor people, Minister Ranathunga added.

Deloitte overtakes PwC as  world's largest firm
Deloitte has overtaken PwC as world's largest firm and has wrestled back its crown as the biggest firm in the world by fee income following a strong year.
Deloitte powered ahead in 2016 as its global fee income grew by 5% to $36.8bn (29.52bn), nudging it ahead of Big Four rival PwC.
Last year PwC seized back the top spot after two years of playing catch-up but in 2016 it recorded only 2% growth in fee income for a total of 28.79bn, according to the latest global network rankings from International Accounting Bulletin.
EY remained solidly in third place but still a long way from the top two with income of 21.35bn (3% growth year-on-year) and stayed slightly ahead of KPMG, which recorded growth of 4% to 20.39bn.
The Big Fours dominance shows no sign of letting up as the gap haswidened. In fifth spot, BDO saw its fee income grow by 4% to 6.1bn while in sixth place RSM enjoyed growth of 5% to 3.9bn. Grant Thornton improved its fee income by 3% to 3.83bn.
Overall it was a strong year for the profession globally as every firm in the top 10 recorded growth. Deloitte is the number one employer with a total of 244,400 people working
for the firm, while KPMG is fourth largest with 188,983. BDO increased its global workforce by 5% to 67,731 while Grant Thornton boosted its numbers by 11% to 47,004.

Demand for qualified staff high in tourism industry
The tourism industry will create a high number of employment opportunities in the near future for the youth in the country, but the lack of qualified staff is a major issue in the field, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said.
He was addressing a certificate awarding ceremony to 450 students who completed three-month hospitality training programme in Colombo yesterday.
The Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Ministry in collaboration with the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM), Provincial Councils, and private hotel schools have started the three-month training programme to meet the employment needs of the growing tourism industry in Sri Lanka. The programme will provide staff needed for new tourist hotels coming up in the country. By the end of this year, around 6,500 will complete their training in the industry at the ministry.
The programme commenced under a 2016 budget proposal aimed at creating employments in the tourism sector. The Minister said a large number of hotels are being built and there will be a great demand in Sri Lanka and abroad for those who completed the training programme.
We will bring four million tourists to Sri Lanka by 2020. The country recorded around 2.1 million arrivals for 2016 and we expect 2.5 million tourist arrivals this year, the Minister said.
Reportedly, many hotel operators have expressed that they face difficulties in recruiting employees to fill their vacancies due to lack of qualified staff.
The Minister said several hoteliers requested him to allow them to bring down workers from the Philippines and China to work in hotels. However, we have not agreed to this proposal, the Minister said.
The Ministry and the private sector are working together to train the workers for the tourism field. Those who completed the certificate course can join the degree programme conducted by the SLITHM. The employees in the hotel field earn high commissions and service charges in addition to their basic salaries.

Drought-related costs to  challenge fiscal targets - Moodys
Sri Lankas ambitious 2017 fiscal deficit target will be even more challenging to achieve, a credit negative. Drought-related government spending will add to the challenge of containing public expenditures as specified under Sri Lankas current International Monetary Fund (IMF) Extended Fund Facility program,Moodys said.
The government projects a 17.0% increase in overall spending this year, after a decline of 0.7% in 2016 and annual average increases of nearly 12.0% from 2010 to 2015. The increase in planned spending this year largely reflects higher growth-enhancing infrastructure outlays, leaving limited room to cut current expenditures.
The Government said it will continue to provide compensation to households affected by the countrys worst drought in 40 years. The government will provide Rs 10,000 (or about $65.95) per acre of unusable, dried out rice paddies and compensation for other crops for a period of four months. The compensation is in addition to Rs 82 million of drought-related spending so far. Although these measures provide affected families with income, they will increase government spending at a time when Sri Lankas fiscal strength is low.
No official information is available yet on the extent of the damage to crops, but if half the paddy acreage sown in 2015 is unusable, that would equal 1.5 million acres and the fiscal cost of the compensation would be 0.1%-0.2% of GDP, plus costs related to compensation for other crops. According to the Sri Lankan Ministry of Disaster Management and World Food Programme, only 35% of cultivable rice paddy land had been farmed as of the end of November, the lowest level in the last 30 years.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas major reservoirs were at only 29% of capacity as of the end of December, and hydropower availability was only 30% of total installed capacity. The drought will weigh on GDP growth because of lower overall agricultural production. We expect the drought to weigh on economic activity in the first half of this year, with the summer monsoon rains providing some relief in the second half.
Lower agricultural output will reduce exports, household income and consumption in affected areas, posing downside risks to GDP growth.
We currently expect real GDP to increase by 5.0% in 2017, which is materially lower than the governments forecast of 6.0%. Weaker economic activity will weigh on government revenues.
We currently forecast a fiscal deficit at 5.2%, which could be revised upward if the negative credit effect of the drought worsens or is not offset by other fiscal measures. Under the IMFs Extended Fund Facility program, the government targets a deficit of 4.6% of GDP in 2017.
Moreover, lower agricultural exports and higher imports to substitute for the loss in domestic production will weigh on Sri Lankas current account deficit and foreign-exchange reserve buffers, a key constraint to Sri Lankas credit quality. Sri Lanka, like many of its South Asian neighbors, is highly vulnerable to climate change because the magnitude and dispersion of seasonal monsoon rainfall influences agricultural sector growth and rural household consumption.
Therefore, droughts can create economic and social costs for the sovereign. For Sri Lanka, the agricultural sector makes up about 9% of GDP and about 28% of the economys workforce.

Dwayne Smith announces retirement from international cricket
West Indies batsman Dwayne Smith has announced his retirement from all international cricket. Smith, 33, who is playing for Islamabad United in the ongoing Pakistan Super League, confirmed the decision before the start of the second qualifying final against Karachi Kings in Sharjah. His last West Indies appearance came at the 2015 World Cup.
Smith made his international debut on West Indies tour of South Africa 2003-04, beginning with the New Years Test in Cape Town in January 2004, after Marlon Samuels flew home with a knee injury.
He made an impression straightaway, scoring a century on debut - a run-a-ball unbeaten 105, his only international century - in the second innings of the game, to help West Indies draw the match and end their streak of seven successive Test losses in South Africa.
The team, however, did lose the series 3-1. Smith played only nine more Tests, scoring a total of 320 runs in the format. His last Test appearance for West Indies was in March 2006, against New Zealand in Napier.
Smith had a far more substantial run in the limited-overs sides, where he also made useful contributions with his medium-pace, although his batting returns remained modest. Having begun in the lower order, Smith was promoted to the top order, including as an opener, after 2014 and did better there. Six of his eight ODI fifties came when he batted in the top three, and his average of 25.27 was better than his overall career average of 18.57.
Overall, he played 105 ODIs scoring 1560 runs at a strike rate of 92.69. He also took 61 wickets in ODIs, with a career-best of 5 for 45 and three four-fors.
Smith was part of two World Cup squads for West Indies in 2007 and in 2015, where his final appearance came against UAE in Napier. Following West Indies early exit from the 2007 World Cup, Smith spent close to three years out of the ODI and T20I squads before making his return in 2010.
He was part of three World T20 squads - in 2007, 2012 and 2014. While he played only one match during West Indies title run in the 2012 World T20, he was picked in the next edition as the sides designated opener and scored 125 runs in five matches. In 33 T20 internationals, he scored 582 runs at 18.18 with a strike rate of 122.78, although he only made three fifties.
Smith has been a popular cricketer on the T20 circuit, over the last few years, turning out to play for franchises in the Indian Premier League, the Caribbean Premier League, the Bangladesh Premier League and the Pakistan Super League, as well as the NatWest Blast in England.

Elevation of Mankulam as NP capital runs into environmental snags
Environmental concerns have been raised over the Governments plan to develop Mankulam as the capital city of the Northern Province.
UPFA MP Douglas Devananda said water scarcity and the human elephant conflict in the area could be aggravated due to depletion of forest cover as a result of development of the city. He urged the Government to implement the development plan taking utmost care to minimize the possible environmental damage.
The area marked to be developed is rich with water resources and also contains a spring. A greater share of water requirement in Vavuniya, Mulathivu and Killinochchi is supplied from this area. The North is already facing an acute water scarcity. Given this situation the planned development activities could cause serious problems when it comes to supplying drinking water and water for agricultural purposes and for animals. The area marked is also frequented by wild elephants and the people living in the area could be vulnerable to elephant attacks he said.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said greater attention has been paid to minimize the environmental harm from this planned activity. He said a Strategic Environment Assessment was done to identify the forest reserves, eco-sensitive areas, water conservation areas and areas for town development.
He said the planned project will span till 2030, adding that 12.8 square kilometers (31,000 acres) have been identified for the purpose. Out of this 0.6 square kilometers (1,400 acres) are covered with shrubs.
Environmental Impact Assessment report is compulsory for the development of this area and for that the approval of the Forest Conservation Department and Wildlife Conservation Department is a must. We have proposed to develop the Mankulam area with least impact on water resources he explained.
He also said a comprehensive study was done to identify the areas frequented by the wild elephants in the area, adding that the area earmarked does not contain elephant corridors. He said his ministry is only concerned with the plan for the development of Mankulam and that its implementation would be undertaken by relevant public institutions subject to approval of the Northern Provincial Council and other relevant bodies.

'End One-Upsmanship  for economy's  recovery'
Sri Lanka's political leadership has to get real by making every effort to put an end to One-Upsmanship in order to get the economy out of its mess, KPMG Managing Partner Riyaz Mihular said.
Speaking at a conference on capital markets 2017 held in Colombo, he stressed that government must govern rather than doing businesses while creating a conductive environment for the private sector to take off.
He however noted the government has been successful in managing the activities of both Customs and Inland Revenue Department which has led to an increase in revenue collection. Noting that New Customs Act , amendments to Inland revenue Act and the proposed credit guarantee scheme are good measures that need to be seen through, he further added the both political parties should come to a consensus when it comes to implementing these proposals to achieve set economic targets,.
The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's economic policies have widely been acclaimed by both home and home, the vision has been solid; but , it is a question of implementation.
While apprising the government efforts to promote Public Private Partnership ( PPP) projects in Sri Lanka, Mihular said that PPPs would be an effective way in which Sri Lanka could leverage on its asset base using the private sector management.

Faiszer happy with Delimitation Committee report
Minister of Local Government and Provincial Councils, Faiszer Musthapha said he was satisfied with the highly controversial Delimitation Committee report and believed it to be fair to all. Amendments to the Local Authorities (Special Provisions) Act of No 21 of 2012 however are yet to be made and though the minister believes that this can be done soon, it will further delay the local government elections expected this year.
Excerpts follow:
Q: What is happening to the Delimitation Committee report
A: The report has been to be gazetted. We are on track and I have given a report which is fair to all, compared to the original report which was biassed and arbitrarily done to the whims and fancies of Basil Rajapaksa.
He did that without consulting the political leadership of the country.
Q: Minister to be clear, were there any changes made to Asoka Peiriss report
A: No. There were no changes made to that report. I dont usually interfere with committees. They had the free mandate to work on it.
Q: When will the elections be held
A: Very soon
Q: So the date has not been decided yet
A: I have done my task and the rest is with the Elections Commissioner. There are a few more issues that I need to solve or steps that I have to take like gazetting the number of members for each local body. And also there are some technical amendments that need to bring to the act no. 21 of 2012.
Q: How long will it take to make changes to the Act
A: I think it will take less than a month. The amendments can be made and passed within a very short time. We have passed certain mile stones and have a few more to achieve.
Q: Has money been allocated for the Local Government elections
A: I dont think this government will deprive the elections of funds. It will go through Cabinet and Parliament will allocate. The government is not going to do anything that would disrupt the franchise.
Q: What is your opinion on allegations that Asoka Peiris was put under heavy pressure The JVP has said there is no freedom for a government servant to execute his duties fairly
A: Everybody can say what they want and that is politics. Unlike in the past, if you say what you like to say, you are not penalized today. There is freedom for all. You can demonstrate, you can protest and you can speak against the government. People are enjoying unprecedented freedom under President Maithripala Sirisena.
Q: What is your opinion on the gap between the Centre and the Periphery
A: Yes there is a big gap between the Centre and the periphery. A chief Ministers forum has been organized by the Ministry and I hope to discuss all the related problems in full there.

Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Mahinda Amaraweera instructed the Fisheries Department to make arrangements to implement an online program to register fishing vessels from 2018.
Fishing vessels are currently registered annually and it has become a huge inconvenience to fishermen.
They are required to travel all the way to Colombo from the hinterlands such as Jaffna, Batticaloa, Ampara and Mannar to get their fishing vessels registered which compelledthe Minister to focus on implementing an alternative program.
Actions are underway to facilitate an online registration system in this regard.
Also, the Minister instructed the Director General of Fisheries to consider the idea of formulating a system to register vessels which will be newly purchased from 2018, once in every five years. 
Currently there are 50,338 fishing vessels in Sri Lanka and 4,218 out of them are multiday fishing vessels while 719 are one day-vessels.

Good buds
The tortoise and the hare may have been fierce rivals, but this real-life tortoise and rabbit are nothing but good buds.
A small desert cottontail rabbit, which appeared to be about two weeks old, mysteriously showed up inside a tortoise enclosure at the Ritz-Carlton, Dove Mountain resort in Marana, Arizona, on the night of February 17, according to a statement by resort ranger Ron Brink.
The bunny was in bad shape, and had gotten into the home of Wamba, the resorts resident African tortoise. Brink, who cares for Wamba, found the little cottontail the next morning.
We found that the bunny had stuff wrapped around his neck, like grass and weeds, Brink said. There were four layers of this plant matter wrapped around, constricting so tightly it was embedded in his skin.
The rabbit and tortoise were cuddled up together, and appeared to have bonded overnight, according to Brinks statement.
As the Rangers attempted to remove the bunny, so as to clear the plant debris from its neck, the tortoise became quite responsive to their actions, emitting grunts and groans in a clear demand for the gentle care of his newly found friend, he said.
A team of rangers is now working to nurse the small rabbit back to health.

IIT presents embedding sustainable  development goals in corporate strategy
The Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT) has organized a Master Class which will focus on Embedding Sustainable Development goals in Corporate Strategy with special attention to how every business can select and prioritize their chosen UN Sustainable Development Goals (UNSDG).
There will only be one session for Sri Lanka in 2017, with sessions scheduled to be held in China and Vietnam between February and October.
The programme is scheduled to be held on March 21, 2017 from 9.00 am to 5.00 pm at Ramada Colombo. The full-day programme will be conducted by Dr Ravi Fernando, a renowned Blue Ocean Strategist and Chairman and CEO of Strategic Corporate Sustainability (Pty) Ltd. He is also an Executive in Residence in the INSEAD business school in France.
The participants of the programme will be provided a clear understanding of the principle of Blue Ocean Strategy and tools to create NewSustainable market spaces for business by identifying which UNSDGs they should impact and thereby align to the new global agenda for sustainable development launched in December 2015 with the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Commenting on the programme Dr Ravi Fernando said, Tomorrows corporate leaders need to be conversant with the new global agenda of sustainable business and aligned to the UN Sustainable Development Goals. This programme gets them up to speed and gives them a clear strategy to do so.
In the technology driven world we live in today, companies around the globe are striving to achieve the highest level of sustainable practices and responsibility in every aspect of its operation. We have taken the key initiative to empower Sri Lankan organizations by promoting sustainable practices and also providing comprehensive knowledge in key specialized areas for corporate professionals.

John Keells Holdings (JKH) Leisure arm will invest around US$ 4 million to refurbish their water bungalows wing of the Maldivian property, Dhonveli. This will commence from October and the 30 bungalow wing will be closed during the time.
Leisure Sector President, Kishan Balendra said in addition they will also invest to build another hotel in the adjoining island. The island was with the group for several years.
We have not decided on the theme or the size of this proposed hotel but it will be something in the excess of 50 rooms, he said. Located no more than a 25-minute speedboat ride from Male, Dhonvelis proximity and diversity combine to make it one of the most popular destinations in the Maldives.
Commenting on the Maldivian leisure sector he said that the unhealthy political situation in the country is having a negative impact for the industry.
This is definitely affecting our bottomline. He also said that some European countries have even stamped negative travel advisories against Maldives and this too will have adverse effect on arrivals. Usually the Maldivian hotel sector from time to time in recent years undergoes this kind of downturn but it is for a short term. This time around it is longer and seems set to continue for more time.
Asked to comment on their flagship property Cinnamon Life in Colombo 2, he said its moving ahead and even structures are being built.
However it will take a longer time than we anticipated for it to be completed.
Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts, a Sri Lankan chain, is looking to enter India with plans to set up two hotels there by 2020.

Mahinda Amaraweera says: SLFP split imminent
No hope for reconciliation between the two factions :
Time to clean up the UPFA :
JO going its own way:
UPFA General Secretary Mahinda Amaraweera said a split within the SLFP was becoming more imminent as the Joint Opposition (JO) continued to work against the SLFP.
We can no longer be patient. If they decide to contest separately, we will have to make a decision, said the General Secretary whose Alliance has become fractured between support for its former leader and the present.
In February 2015, a faction of the SLFP and minor parties of the UPFA Alliance chose to form the Joint Opposition (JO) in support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. The President allowed MPs of his party to sit independently of his government which had been formed through a MoU between the UNP and SLFP.
The President allowed the JO to sit in the Opposition in the spirit of democracy and not to work towards breaking the party.
They have misused their freedom. Usually parties do not allow its members to criticise their leader or ministers but the SLFP Central Committee allowed them to do that, explained Amaraweera who addressed a media briefing at SLFP Headquarters.
A year ago, I predicted that a separate party would be formed and I have been right. This group is indeed moving towards that, he added.
With Local Government Elections promised to be held soon and Provincial Council elections due in September, Amaraweera is worried that a fractured SLFP would lose out heavily at the polls,
Our party machinery on the ground is working well and we have seen a swell of support for the SLFP. We have given all the opportunities to come for our interviews and 95 percent of our interview process is complete. Imagine the result if they put up their own team, he asked.
The UPFA General Secretary further added that he saw no hope of reconciliation between the two factions, I have tried my best to bring all parties together but I later realized that despite my efforts and the Presidents, this cannot be done. Because the group has decided to form their own group and destroy the SLFP, there is no point in our efforts,he said.
With the recent decision of the National Freedom Front (NFF), leader, Wimal Weerawansa and his four other MPs to leave the UPFA, Amaraweera said it was also time to clean up the UPFA. He is to send letters to all partners within the Alliance asking them to write to him if they wished to leave. He explained that they could not accept the letter written by Weerawansa on behalf of his party as his party is not recognized within the Alliance, All of them need to send us individual letters, he said.
Amaraweera however noted that given the electoral consequences of a split, they would give the factions until the last minute to return to the SLFP fold. People usually come back when elections are near, he said.

Malith guides Commercial Credit to victory
Standard Chartered Bank captain, Selwyn Jamion (3rd from left) receiving the runner-up trophy from VP /MCA HUU Buddhima.
A rock solid, unbeaten century by middle order batsman, Malith Fernando (121 not out in 110 balls, inclusive of 02 sixes and 15 fours) guided Commercial Credit & Finance B to a resounding 89 runs win over Standard Chartered Bank in the final of the 6th Prestige Automobile sponsored, BMW/Hyundai Trophy, MCA C division 50 Over League Tournament 2017, concluded at the MCA Grounds on Saturday. Malith Fernando walked in when Commercial Credit was 84 for 3 in 17 overs, anchored the batting and remained unbeaten till the end of innings - 300 for 7 in 50 Overs.
Fernandos path to reach the 300 mark : 45 runs for the 05 th wicket in 44 balls with Janaka Dayananda (22) ; 55 runs for the 7th wicket in 72 balls with his captain, Praneeth Wijesena (24) and unbeaten 89 runs for the 08 th wicket in 48 balls with Damith Mendis (27 not out) Bankers catching and ground fielding left much to be desired, as Commercial Credit scored at will, 100 runs coming in the last 10 overs.
For Standard Charted the 300 mark for not easy to get but was not impossible as all 11 were batsman. It was just a case of putting your head down and building partnerships, as Malith Fernando did for Commercial Credit.
The bankers top order, the 02 centurions, Charith Satharasinghe and Aruna Henrickson, Bhanuka Adeesha, skipper, Selvyn Jamion and Shakthi Siriratne were in good nick, but all 05 of them failed to get off the blocks leaving Standard Chartered completely stranded at 79 for 5 in 17 overs.
As the board read 100 for 7 in 21 overs, no 8 batsman, Hiran Rajapaksa (56 in 50 balls with a six and 09 fours) and no 9 batsman , Raveen Perumal (33 not out in 82 balls with 03 fours) made the top order batsman look very foolish, as they collared the Commercial Credits attack easily with a face saving 70 runs stand for the 8th wicket in 80 balls.
Rajapaksa and Perumals valiant effort only proved a point, as SCB fell by the way side, all out for 211 in 46.5 overs.
It was easy pickings for the Match Referee, KH Nandasena to name the Man of the Match - Malith Fernando from Commercial Credit & Finance B.
The other three special awards, based on performances up to the semi finals went to Best Bowler Sachin Bandara from Commercial Credit B (17 wickets for 170 runs) , Best Batsman / Trishan Rodrigo from Peoples Leasing Finance (302 runs including a century) and Man of the Series / Aruna Henrickson from Standard Chartered (290 runs with 1 century and 02 half centuries and 12 wickets)

Mexican congressman climbs U.S. border fence to illustrate that Trump's wall is 'totally absurd'

A Mexican congressman went to great lengths and heights on Wednesday to illustrate why he believes that President Trump's controversial U.S.-Mexico border wall is "unnecessary" and "totally absurd."
Braulio Guerra, a congressman from the state of Queretaro, tweeted photos and a video of himself perched atop a 30-foot tall fence that separates the Mexican border city of Tijuana from the U.S.
"I was able to scale it, climb it, and sit myself right here," Guerra said in the video. "It would be simple for me to jump into the United States, which shows that it is unnecessary and totally absurd to build a wall."
He adds, "It's easy, and it shows how unnecessary this project, this political rhetoric fromDonald Trump, is."
In one of the photos Guerra tweeted, two other people atop the wall are visible. Guerra said they were climbing the wall while he was there.
"You can climb it with great ease, one climbs in an instant," Guerra says in the video. "I climbed it in Tijuana, one of the highest parts, even from a distance this looks very complex, but there are young people that go up and down, at all times."
It is worth noting, though, that Guerra did not post any photos or video footage of himself climbing the wall, so some in the Twittersphere questioned how he reached the top and how easy such a feat really is.

Jackson, 18,told Rolling Stonethat after she graduated from high school in 2015, she spent one year in community college before deciding she wanted to do something else with her career.
Because her adolescence was plagued by constant criticism from online trolls who mocked her appearance, she found modeling to be cathartic.
"I've had self-esteem issues for a really, really long time," she said. "Plenty of people think I'm ugly, and plenty of people don't. But there's a moment when I'm modeling where I forget about my self-esteem issues and focus on what the photographer's telling me  and I feel pretty. And in that sense, it's selfish."

## Title: Moving towards a cashless economy
## Supertitle:

Moving towards a cashless economy
Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi recently urged for a movement to turn his country into a cashless society. Its main advantage, he said, is that a record of all economic transactions through electronic means makes it almost impossible to sustain black market or underground economy.
He asked young people to become the soldiers of change in turning India into a cashless economy.
But India is not the only country in the world, and certainly not the first, to make the big move to becoming cashless. This is a global trend, countries both in the developed and developing economies, are making great strides in eliminating or minimising the use of paper money. These countries are not cashless, in the true sense of the word  some cash still does the rounds. So, as some economists believe, less-cash countries may be the more accurate description.
Why are the Governments of many countries moving in favour of moving to cashless systems The reasons are the same everywhere  cash trails are hard to trace, leaving doors open for frauds, corruption and burglary. As cash permits anonymity in transactions, it leaves a vacuum open for tax evasion and even funding low-cost terrorism.
Sri Lankan stand
What is the official stand of Sri Lanka on digitalisation of the economy Few months ago, Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure Minister Harin Fernando said on the side-lines at #2030NOW, that Sri Lanka is on the process of digitisation, where innovative technologies are transforming national infrastructure to kick start the economy. He also revealed that by early 2017, the Household Transfer Management (HTM) card system will be launched which will digitise the whole platform from financial transaction to all data.
However, in Sri Lanka, technology wise, things move at a slower pace. It is said that the lack of enterprise and archaic regulations are hindering the growth of the digital economy.
What exactly is a cashless economy In simple terms, it means most of the transaction will be done by digital means like e banking, debit and credit cards, PoS (point of sales) machines, digital wallets etc.
Theoretically, no liquid money or paper currency will be used by the people in a given country. In reality, it never happens. Take the top seven cashless countries in the world: Singapore (61%) -Netherlands  (60%) France- (59%)  Sweden - (59%) Canada (57%) - Belgium (56%) -United Kingdom (52%). Within brackets, you find the percentage of cashless transactions.
In a cashless economy, a third party will be in possession of your money. That party can be the Government or a public or private sector bank who will allow you to transact that money whenever it is needed.
There are a number of other advantages of cashless society to the country and citizens both.
Convenience: The ease of conducting financial transactions is probably the biggest motivator to go digital. You will no longer need to carry wads of cash, plastic cards, or even queue up for ATM withdrawals. Its also a safer and easier spending option when you are travelling.
Financial inclusion: Digital economy will help to enhance the countrys current banking system. There will be increased access to credit for people who did not fall in any banking network. Financial inclusion will help reduce poverty.
Boost in consumption: There would be no incentive for people keeping extra money in the bank. Therefore, most of them would invest on short and medium term portfolios. It will help to boost economy creating jobs and increasing the income level of people.
Security and convenience: Another benefit is security and convenience. You dont have to carry a wallet with money in it. You just use your mobile phone or credit/debit card for transaction. It is very hassle free and already going on in urban areas of the country.
But there are drawbacks also.
Higher risk of identity theft: The biggest fear is the risk of identity theft. Since we are culturally not attuned to digital transactions, even well-educated people run the risk of falling into phishing traps. With the rising incidence of online fraud, the risk of hacking will only grow as more people hop on to the digital platform.
Difficult for not-so-tech-savvy: The practical difficulty of going digital, a bigger block is the psychological shift. You are suddenly jumping three generations to the digital medium. Its a problem for the older people, and people from remote areas who are not at all savvy in technology. They may suddenly find themselves locked. As time goes on, they will pick up the strands.
Our internet penetration is well above South Asian standards with over six million internet users. Our financial inclusion record also surpasses the South Asian standards. According to the Global Financial Inclusion Indicators (Global Findex) 80 % of households in our country have access to financial institutions, at least for loans and savings. However, there is still more work to be done to expand financial inclusion among women and the poorest households.
Even with all such plus points, it will not be easy for our economic sector to become cashless, and particularly the informal sector is likely to be affected the most because of its general preference for cash transactions. Small-time merchants prefer not to keep records for their own reasons and buyers who patronise them find cash payments more convenient.
However, during the past decade, the digital transactions became widespread in Sri Lanka and the banking sector had been rolling-out more and more digitalised services. As a result, cashless transactions have gone up in recent times. For instance, mobile wallets have seen notable attraction, and it is possible that a large number of Sri Lankans have moved straight from cash to mobile wallets.
A material transition to a cashless economy will depend on a number of factors. First, the availability and quality of telecom network will play an important role. Second, banks and related service providers will have to constantly invest in technology in order to improve security and ease of transaction.
People will only shift when its easier, certain and safe to make cashless transactions. Third, the government will also need to play its part. It will have to find ways to incentivize cashless transactions and discourage cash payments.
Another important factor is the perception of consumers. This perception needs to be changed by educating extensively about the security and convenience of digital transactions.
Governments role
What can be done by the Government to discourage the extensive use of cash by people
(1) Promote mobile wallets which allows users to instantly send money, pay bills, recharge mobiles, book movie tickets, send physical and e-gifts both online and offline, (2) Promote e-commerce by liberalizing the norms for this sector, (3) Withdraw or liberalise surcharge, service charge on cards and digital payments, (4) Encourage and incentivise opening of Bank accounts and ensure they are operationalized, (5) Abolish government fees on credit card transactions; reduction of interchange fee on card transactions; increase in taxes on ATM withdrawals, (6) Tax rebates for consumers and for merchants who adopt electronic payments, (7) Make Electronic payment infrastructure completely safe and secure so that incidents of Cybercrimes could be minimized and people develop faith in electronic payment system, (8) Create a culture of saving and faith in financial system among the rural poor.
The regulators also need to keep a sharp eye on any potential restrictive practices that banks may indulge in to maintain their current dominance over the lucrative payments business.
Future
Let us have a 5-7 year plan to reach 50 per cent of our total citizen transactions cashless or digital. Starting from urban areas, different trajectories need to be planned for migration to cashless for those having bank account and for those not having. Rushing the economy into a cashless state without proper planning and infrastructure will be disastrous and its consequences will last for a long period.
The world has become borderless. As a result, societies are becoming paperless. As money as a means of payment has evolved along history, and in the past decades it has become less physical and more digital, it seems then moneys final destiny is to become digital.

Navy arrests 21 Tamil Nadu fishermen: Indian Chief Minister writes to Modi

As twenty-one fishermen were arrested by the Navy for allegedly entering intoSri Lankanwaters, Indian Chief Minister Edappadi K. Palanisami wrote to Prime Minister Narendra Modi yesterday (2), seeking his intervention in getting them released.
Nine fishermen in a mechanised fishing boat who set sail from Nagapattinam fishing base of Nagapattinam District and 4 fishermen in a mechanised fishing boat who set sail from Rameswaram fishing base of Ramanathapuram District were apprehended by the Sri Lankan Navy, the CM said.
Noting that the state government is extremely concerned about the continuing apprehension and detention of our fishermen and their boats, he said the International Maritime Boundary Line (IMBL) is itself a matter that is subjudice in the Supreme Court of India.
Forty-eight fishermen and hundred and twenty-two fishing boats are currently in Sri Lankan custody. Further, boats and fishing gear of these fishermen which are the only means of livelihood of the poor fishermen are still impounded in Sri Lanka, Palanisami said in the letter.
He asked Modi to take up this serious issue with the highest authorities of the Sri Lankan Government and ensure the immediate release of the precariously berthed boats.

Packed and contaminated archaic town
With 1.8 million people entering Colombo on a daily basis, Pettah is choked by jostling streets, vehicles, nattamis, traffic, a very tired populace and a walk around the neighbourhood of Pettah can be exciting for all the wrong reasons.
The geography of Pettah includes Main Street, Reclamation Road, Bankshall Street, Olcott Mawatha, McCalum Road (now D.R.Wijewardane Rd.), Front Street, 1st Cross Street, 2nd Cross Street, 3rd Cross Street, 4th Cross Street, 5th Cross Street, Keyzer Street, Prince Street, Maliban Street, Sea Street, Gabos Lane and Bodhiraja Mawatha.
A daily traveller to Pettah for work, 27-year-old Anjula Samaranayake, an accountant from Madampe, said it was a nightmare to walk on the busy streets of Pettah.
I drag myself through Pettahs side walks every day during rush hour. Some men purposely bump in to us or brush against us and try to touch us. Some men whisper filth while passing us. Women are both physically and mentally harassed when walking on the streets of Pettah. I usually arm myself with my handbag or my umbrella to keep away certain men purposely bumping into me. Finally as I reach my office or Colombo Fort Railway Station to go back home. I feel angry, tired and abused. Something should be done to help the pedestrians walk freely on the side walk, Anjula said.
A sales assistant, 35-year-old Ravindran pointed out that the road along the floating market had become a personal lavatory.
I spend a lot of time walking to and forth on the Pettah streets. A part of Bastien Mawatha that runs behind the Manning market has become a personal lavatory. Some people urinate along the street in broad daylight where women and children pass by all the time.
Then if you look at the empty space between the State Pharmaceutical Outlet and some neglected buildings, it has become a spot for smokers. I dont know if they are allowed to smoke there, but it definitely is happening. Then, there is no proper disposal system to put away leftover meat at the market. The crows bring these leftovers and put them all over the place to rot and stink, Rajendran said.
I usually get down near the entrance to the SLTB bus stand as I reach Colombo for work. Then I take the short cut between the lines of boutiques, which leads to Bo-Gaha junction police post. Just as I pass the fruit stalls by the side of the street the whole area smells like a lavatory. There are a few places that sell food near the area as well, Lakshitha Dissanayake a 27-year-old software developer from Belummahara said. A shop owner, Ramzi, near Olcott Mawatha, said that the area around has become a turf for prostitutes.
There are prostitutes operating in these streets both day and night. It disturbs the public. It disturbs the businesses as well. They even do make up and wait in some of the three wheelers temporarily parked near where the Kirihala (Highland Milk Shop) is situated, close to the Pettah station. It is alleged that some law enforcement officials are behind this business as well. The fine on prostitutes is only around Rs.100, so they couldnt care less of being arrested, the shop owner said.
Add to that, these women have all the possible venereal diseases in the world. The girls who work in the shops nearby cannot stand in the streets more than ten to fifteen minutes waiting until the shops are open, or for any other other reason because the men around start to think they are prostitutes as well. So men try to brush against these girls and talk filth to them, he added.
Pettah being one of the main business districts of Colombo has also gone largely unnoticed when it comes to its pavements and roads. Pot-holes and unsafe pavements make an ugly mosaic along Pettah walkways.
A tired Nandani Gamage who had come from Ambepussa for shopping said she could not differentiate the road from the side walk.
I walked on 1st cross street, 2nd cross street and 3rd Cross Street with my son. In all these streets, I could not figure out where to walk and where not to. People walk everywhere, in the street. Then there are no visible side walks either. If by any chance, the side walks exist, they are not in a condition to be used, she said.
The cement tiles are unsafe. They are broken or unstable. I personally am very afraid to walk on these broken pavements. If the pavements are in a usable state, they are dominated by the street vendors when it is the seasonal shopping period, Nandani added.
Then there are the Nattamis who shout at the people. We can easily get injured by these speeding carts. But we cannot blame the Nattamis either, because they are transporting heavy loads in their carts. I dont think they have separate roads to use. Yet we simply do not have a place to move away. The motor bikes and three wheelers use some of these streets as well. So basically, pedestrians, vehicles, nattami carts are all using the same narrow streets, Nandani continued.
Lack of proper pavements on the roads also affects tourism in the area with entrances to hotels such as the Grand Oriental Hotel being dilapidated and unsafe to access.
Nishanta Chamara, a businessman in Pettah said the beggar-community in and around Pettah was anti-social and it disturbed the daily activities of the area.
The professional-beggars not only engage in begging but also are involved in drug dealing. The dealers use the beggars as an easy medium to transport drugs. No one usually checks the beggars, so it is an added advantage. Only the people involved in this scheme know from whom to get drugs, Chamara said.
He also said that SLTB bus station and the front yard of the Colombo Fort Railway station had become sleeping spots for these beggars.
The Urban Development Authority Deputy Director- Planning Priyani Navaratne in the meantime said that the Pettah area would undergo major development transformations under an accelerated Megapolis development plan.
Following the shifting of the Manning Market, the whole area of Pettah is going to become a multi-model transportation hub, Navaratne explained.
The Colombo Fort train station area specifically is now demarcated as a transport hub. The whole Pettah area will be in connection with the rest of the Colombo city under this plan. There is a proposal to restore and revitalize the adjacent Fort area into a historical area as well. Then there is a special plan on developing both Fort and Pettah areas as a top-notch tourist destination, Navaratne further said. Asked if there was a plan to shift the line of shops by the sides of Olcott Mawatha, Navaratne replied in the negative.
We are not going to shift all the shops. We will have to shift only the shops which are not compatibly located with the proposed development plans, said Navaratne. In the meantime, it is yet another rough day on the streets of Pettah.

Speaking on a recent comment made in this regard by the UN Human Rights Commissioner, the President said he had replied within 24 hours to the Commissioner noting his stance.

President to soon clarify Govts stance on Constitution
President Maithripala Sirisena will soon make clear what the governments stance on the Constitution is, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday, as the question of the referendum remained unanswered between the two major political parties in the country.
Confusion has been rife over the nature of the changes proposed to the Constitution with the SLFP insisting that only amendments that do not need a referendum would be made while the UNP has been firm that they there would be a new Constitution with a referendum.
Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera earlier this week informed the UNHRC in Geneva that a new Constitution with a referendum would be introduced and co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne affirmed his statement at the weekly Cabinet media briefing on Wednesday, It is the governments stance, said Minister Senaratne adding weight to the argument.

## Title: Problems of Private Medical Education in Sri Lanka
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Local
## Date: Friday, March 3, 2017 - 01:00
Problems of Private Medical Education in Sri Lanka
This topic has been discussed in Sri Lanka in various forums. However, the discussions have not focused on the key problems.
a) Inadequate Academic staff
b) Deficiencies in clinical training
c) Danger to the public from persons practising medicine without the required clinical training.
InadequateAcademic Staff
The most important factor for the quality of university education is the presence of qualified academic staff. The percentage of professors in different universities varies from 0 percent to 19.7 percent. The percentages of lectures who are not qualified to lecture and conduct examinations vary from 36 percent to 87.39 percent.
This has resulted in significant differences in the quality of education at different universities. The UGC has not taken any steps to grade the universities.
A significant deficiency is the low percentage of professors in all universities. A short term solution is to increase the retirement age of professors to 70 years. However, the UGC has not implemented this suggestion, although it has been proposed more than five years ago.
How do the private institutes obtain the staff to teach their students It is obvious from the announcements made from SAITM that they have used the services of the academic staff from Government universities.
Academic staff of state universities are not allowed to teach in private institutes during working hours. If the academic staff members want to do private work during office hours, they have to obtain permission from the Head of Department, Dean and the Vice Chancellor. They also have to pay a part of their earnings to the University. Has this procedure been followed If not, who gave permission to the UGC and university administration to turn a blind eye to the violation of the University regulations
A number of academics in the private sector are calling themselves professors. Have these professors obtained the necessary academic qualifications and fulfilled the required criteria as given by the UGC to be promoted to professor grade.
At present to produce a professor, it takes more than fifteen years of training and the Government has to spend more than twenty million rupees to provide facilities for research. However, the Government donates these professors to the private education system free of charge when they reach the age of 65.
Inadequate Clinical Training
The clinical training is the most labour intensive part of medical training. There is no argument that clinical training requires a well equipped and properly staffed teaching hospital. The most important part is the presence of a large patient population. Private hospitals cannot fulfil these criteria. Therefore, private medical schools are unable to provide adequate clinical training. The danger to the public from allowing inadequately trained persons to practice medicine can be seen from the reports of medical error in the USA.
Medical School
In the United States a medical school is an institution with the purpose of educating physicians in the United States in the field of medicine. Admission into medical school may not technically require completion of a previous degree; however, applicants are usually required to complete at least three years of pre-med courses at the University level, because in the US, medical degrees are classified as Second entry degrees.
Once enrolled in a medical school the four years progressive study is divided into two roughly equal components: Pre-clinical and clinical (Clerkships consisting of rotations through different wards of a teaching hospital). The degree granted at the conclusion of the next four years of study is Doctor of Medicine (MD) this degree allows the holder to practice medicine after completing an accredited residency programme.
Board Certification
The Physician or surgeon who has completed his or her residency and possibly fellowship training and is in the practice of his or her specialty is known as an attending physician. The physicians then must pass written and oral exams in their specialty in order to become board certified. Each of the 26 medical specialties has different requirements for practitioners to undertake continuing medical education activities.
All board of certification now requires that medical practitioners demonstrate, by examination, continuing mastery of the core knowledge and skills for a chosen specialty. Recertification varies by particular specialty between every seven to ten years.
The United States has the highest paid general practitioners in the world. In 2009 the number of physicians per 10,000 population was 32.
With all these safeguards in training in 2016 the deaths due to medical error in the USA were 251,454. This is the most common cause of death after heart disease and cancer. Medical error can include misdiagnosis or delayed diagnosis, administration of the wrong drug to the wrong patient or in the wrong way and giving multiple drugs that interact negatively.
It must be very clear that allowing improperly trained persons to practice medicine will result in a much bigger disaster than CKDU. I estimate that this will result in at least ten deaths per year from medical error for each of these untrained practitioners.
These medical error deaths are likely to happen in districts like Batticaloa, Mullaitivu, Monaragala, Mannar, Killinochchi and Ampara were these persons are likely to be posted.

The CIM Future Marketers Conference 2016 was the succeeding event, which kicked off in style at the Hilton Colombo Residence for the fifth consecutive year on the 10th of September 2016. Branding in the Digital Era being the topic on role, sowed the seeds of success as the tickets were sold out prior to the event.
With successful events on the cards, the committee winded up with the third and final event a social initiative under the theme SMILE by visiting Ketewela Kanishta Vidyalaya located in the Kurunegela district.
SMILE reached its ultimate success on October 29 2016, when the 19 member squad touched the hearts of the pupils with their epic generosity as the team entertained the children by getting them actively involved in fun filled activities and also shared practical business and marketing knowledge and insights which will benefit them in future.

Ravi challenges Mahinda to go before Courts
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to go before Courts if the vital details that the Minister exposed to the media how the previous regime influenced the bond issues are false.
The minister pointed out that such issues should not be discussed in places of worship or on political platforms. He said the judiciary system has been freed today to enable any faction to seek justice from any Court against injustice.
The Minister expressed these views on March 1 at the launch of Sri Lanka Customs official new website at the new auditorium of the Finance Ministry in Colombo. The Customs Department re-launched its official website to enable customers to obtain necessary information hassle free. Minister Karunanayake said the government was changed, but certain officers who aided corruption of the previous government have still been serving in the Central Bank.
This is the 10th time I make the challenge to former President. He accepted none of my nine previous challenges. There is no point complaining at every junction and on political platforms. Several senior officers of the Central Bank who aided and abetted the corrupt administration of the bank which was reined jointly by Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Mahinda Rajapaksa are still serving in their posts. So we exposed them. Therefore, I repeatedly challenge them to go before Courts if our exposure is untrue, Minister Karunanayake said.
The minister also expressed his views about the new action plan of the Customs Department.
The proposals made in Budget 2017 were implemented and have reached to successful levels. Tthe Sri Lanka Customs is marching fast successfully than in the past. We all should be proud of it. However, we should speed up our pace more and more. The website we launched today will help the general public to make easy access to the Customs hassle free. It will also create more transparency as well. Operations of the Customs should be fully open to the people. We speak about transparency and we implement such policies as well. Customs officials have been allowed to go overseas for further education in customs activities.
I should remind these young officers of the Customs that we are ready to provide such facilities further if anybody needs to pursue higher studies in the sector. Ministers need not to participate in this type of events. It is my duty to perform such activities in full transparency.
Sri Lanka Customs Department Director General Chulananda Perera also spoke.
There are several special features on this new website. One specific item is that it was designed and developed by our staff.
It is user friendly. It will be updated constantly and a special committee has been appointed to attend to such needs. We will set up a new human relations unit in the near future. The proposed Unit will provide our customers easy access to the information of their containers round the clock, the Director General said.

Rise of Rice!: SLT calendar 2017
Sri Lanka Telecom 2017 calendar published under the theme traditional rice with each month being dedicated to a variety of indigenous rice, is indeed a commendable attempt to educate the masses on the value and benefits of our staple food. The SLT hopes to promote the standard of health among the citizens of Sri Lanka while also ensuring the preservation of a priceless part of our national heritage. A campaign in order to educate, encourage and reward farmers will be launched soon.
Scientifically termed Oryza Sativa,traditional rice is considered as one of the most nutritious staple foods. Historical records have indicated that varieties of traditional rice were revered among the ancients for their nutritional and medicinal purposes. In the past Sri Lanka was known to have produced over 2000 varieties of indigenous rice however, by the 20th century the number had dwindled to 567. This is mostly due to the growing ignorance among the general public of the importance and value of traditional rice, especially when it comes to matters of health and nutrition.
In the olden days ailments such as heart attacks, high blood pressure, diabetes were almost unheard of. Our ancestors lived long, wholesome and healthy lives. Specialists have credited this to the diet followed by our forebears, in which rice took the place of honor.
In general traditional rice has been medically proven to; help reduce, and in some cases prevent, diabetic conditions, minimize cardiovascular conditions, contain antioxidant properties and a low glycemic index, prevent fatty liver, be the best known source of Vitamin B, aid in muscle recovery, reduce or completely prevent blood sugar, be rich in fiber and selenium, and to contain zero cholesterol. Indigenous rice has also been known to prevent gallstones and breast cancer.
Varieties such as Ma-Wee have been recommended for tuberculosis patients and to be effective remedies for purging, constipation and hemorrhoids. Ma-Wee is also known for its importance in religious ceremonies. While other varieties like Kaluheenati are known for their high fiber content and serving as an effective means of controlling the toxic effects of snakebites. Physicians also recommend Kaluheenati to hepatitis patients and lactating mothers. This particular variety is also said to enhance physical strength and male sexual potency. Pachchaperumal is a type of traditional rice known to be rich in nutrients and protein, while such varieties as Madathawaluare highly recommended in Ayurveda treatment to strengthen the immune system. The list of benefits offered by indigenous rice is almost endless. Every variety of rice is known to play a role in developing the human body, boosting the immune system and preventing various illnesses. - SL

SAFE leaders call for improved integration of regional markets
Leaders from the South Asian capital market were united in their call for improved integration of regional markets as they shared their views on the way forward for exchanges in South Asia, at an event recently held at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The views were expressed by Chief Executives of Stock Exchanges from around South Asia, who gathered in Colombo for the Executive Committee Board Meeting and workshop of SAFE.
SAFE aims to foster collaboration and co-operation among its members in order to develop their respective capital markets. Presently SAFE has members comprising of stock and commodity exchanges across South Asia and several depositories and clearing houses in the region as associate members.Sri Lanka has held the Chairmanship of the SAFE Secretariat since 2015.
The following are highlights of remarks shared by the speakers at the event.
Domestic exchanges have much to gain should we reinforce and improve our effort towards integration, SAFE and CSE Chairman Vajira Kulatilaka said.
As we all know, capital markets globally, regionally and even in our nations, are constantly evolving and embracing transformation. The role and impact of an exchange today, is well beyond what was defined at the inception of SAFE as an organization. This is even more so for emerging and developing countries, which many of us are a part of. It is therefore quite relevant that SAFE today looks at evolving as an organization.
We are well aware that our members are at different junctures in their bid for growth and improvement, which is a something that works to our advantage. It also outlines the importance and relevance of an organization such as SAFE. Our diversity is our strength, and our ability to learn from each other through collaboration and knowledge sharing is a key benefit of being a part of an organization of this nature. Smaller exchanges in the region for an instance, have the ability to benchmark more developed peers, while our more developed peers have the privilege of shaping the future of fellow regional exchanges - a process that is brought into the table through affiliation.
The CSE takes great pride in our involvement with SAFE over the years, and we are pleased to have taken the initiative to advance and protect the interests of the South Asian region and our fellow regional exchanges since inception. We are particularly honoured to have played a part in initiating an effort to shape the future direction of SAFE, in our capacity as the Chair for the current term.
Bombay Stock Exchange (BSE) CFO Nayan Mehta credited the transformation of the exchange to the Indian Government's strong commitment to the capital market since 1991, which sparked a reform process that transformed the exchange from several operational low points to the largest operation in India and South Asia today. He added that stakeholder management, investment in technology and a strict commitment to compliance and transparency were key drivers that propelled the exchange.
SAFE Secretary General Aftab Ahmed said It is critical that we also improve the governance of our exchanges and in our region through demutualization, mainly to relieve brokers from the governance aspects of the exchange so that the exchanges have the ability to provide products and services that are in the best interest of the investors.
He also went on to highlight the importance of South Asian exchanges embracing the increasing influence of SMEs and startups in global affairs, stating that exchanges around the world are already reaping the benefits of providing fund raising opportunities to such enterprises.
Chittagong Stock Exchange MD Shaifur Rahman Mazumdar said The regulators have worked to change the rules and regulations to create a strong and transparent primary market. We therefore now have the platform ready to create a robust IPO market and we have experienced a strong demand for IPOs in our country.
A number of large companies are in the pipeline of getting approval from regulators for listing on the exchange.
Delegates from the Bombay Stock exchange (BSE), Pakistan Stock Exchange (PSX), Chittagong Stock Exchange, Maldives Stock Exchange, Royal Securities Exchange of Bhutan, Central Depository Bangladesh, Mercantile Exchange Nepal, The Stock exchange of Mauritius, the Nepal Stock Exchange and the Colombo Stock Exchange attended the event.
Chief Executives of CSE Member & Trading Member Firms were also invited. The Chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission of Sri Lanka Thilak Karunaratne graced the event as the Chief Guest.
The event was sponsored by Ironone Technologies.

Shani Diluka performs at Virtuosi in Concert
Shani Diluka, who has thrilled audiences in Sri Lanka with her virtuoso piano playing, will return to perform with the Symphony Orchestra of Si Lanka on March 15 at the Ladies College Hall.
Shani, described by Piano Magazine as One of the greatest of her generation, has been playing with major orchestras and legendary conductors in many countries, including Europe, UK, Japan and Russia. Shani has released more than 10 internationally acclaimed recordings. Her recordings of Beethoven, Mendelssohn, and Grieg, released on Mirare/Harmonia Mundi, have earned her many awards. This season, Shani Diluka will be appearing in France, Germany, Japan, Austria, Russia, touring with Natalie Dessay, and in solo Recital at La RoquedAnthron festival, in Thtre des Champs Elysees, Vienna Konzerthaus, Salzburg Mozarteum, Ravinia Festival in USA, Paris Philharmonie, Folle Journe Festival in Nantes, Japan and Russia.
This will be her first performance with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Acclaimed musicians, Gabriel Le Magadure and Valentin Erben, will join Shani in performing Beethovens Triple Concerto with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka.
Ebne Quartet violinist Gabriel Le Magadure is widely recognized by international critics as an outstanding musician full of sensitivity, with a warm, deep sound and an exceptional capacity to listen. Gabriel Le Magadure has performed at some of the worlds most prestigious music halls, including New Yorks Carnegie Hall, Berlins Philharmonie, Londons Wigmore Hall, Amserdams Concert gebouw and Viennas Musikverein.
Valentin Erben, an Austrian Cellist, was a former member of the prestigious Lucern Festival Orchestra conducted by Claudio Abbado. He was also the co-founder of the international string quartet, Alban Berg Quartet, which performed for almost 40 years. Valentin and Shani released a recording of the complete Beethoven works for cello and piano in the fall of 2016.
Virtuosi in Concert, sponsored by the Peoples Bank, will be directed by Japanese conductor Keiko Kobayashi. Guest conductor of the SOSL for many years, Keiko has established a reputation for her dynamic and animated presence at the podium. Her forceful presence draws out the best from the musicians and elevates their performance to great heights. The highlight of the evenings program will be Beethovens Triple Concerto, performed by the SOSL and the three foreign soloists. The program will also include Rossinis Overture to the Barber of Seville and Malcolm Arnolds Inn of the Sixth Happiness Suite.
Beethovens Triple Concerto was composed around 1804. Beethoven took up the challenge of writing a concerto, for piano, violin and cello soloists, which was unheard of at that time. Although it is rarely performed, it remains in the repertoire and has delighted many audiences with its grand, tranquil, harmonious and lively music.
The Overture to The Barber of Seville, is one of Rossinis most well known and recognizable, with its exciting and lively music. Although this overture had originally been composed as the introduction of a tragic opera and used again as the overture to a historical opera it functioned perfectly and remained as the introduction to a comic tale, which was the essence of the Barber of Seville.
Malcolm Arnold composed numerous film scores, of which the best known is his Oscar winning Bridge on the River Kwai. His film scores rank among the finest composed for that genre. The film score for Inn of the Sixth Happiness, a film which featured Ingrid Bergmen, won him the Ivor Novello Award in 1958. Celebrating the 60th year of performance, the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka presents this special program as the first concert for 2017.
Tickets and Box plan are online at tickets.lk or in person at 85/10 Jawatta Gardens, Col 5, Abans Showrooms Colpetty, Yamaha Music Center, Sarasavi Bookshop Nugegoda and Maharagama.

SL Navy arrests 13 TN fishermen, CM writes to Modi
Thirteen Indian fishermen were on Thursday arrested by the Sri Lankan Navy, prompting the Tamil Nadu government to dash off a letter to the Centre seeking its intervention.
Taking up the matter with Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Chief Minister E K Palaniswami, in a letter, said the state government was "extremely" concerned over such incidents and sought Centre's intervention into the matter. Such incidents of the arrest of "our fishermen by the Sri Lankan Navy (should) be taken up strongly at the highest diplomatic level to ensure the safety and security of our fishermen in the Palk Bay," he said.
"The government of Tamil Nadu is extremely concerned about the continuing apprehension and detention of our fishermen and their boats," Palaniswami said.
The fishermen were arrested while fishing near Katchatheevu islet.
At present, 48 fishermen and 122 fishing boats, including those detained on Thursday, were under Lankan custody, the chief minister said, adding, boats and fishing gear which were their only means of livelihood were still "impounded" in Lanka.
He said that late Chief Minister Jayalalithaa had earlier repeatedly pointed out that Sri Lanka was following "a deliberate strategy of keeping the apprehended fishing boats of our fishermen in custody and thereby completely impairing their only source of livelihood."
"Without their livelihood base, these fishermen are in a state of despondency. Though the government of Sri Lanka committed to consider the release of these boats, no decision has been taken in this regard," he said.

SLFP Divulapitiya organiser queries : Why did Indika put the cap on
Western Provincial Council member, Divulapitiya SLFP Chief Organiser and Co-Chairman Divulapitiya Regional Co-ordinating Committee Chandana Jayakody commenting on the brawl between Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha at a committee meeting held recently said he was puzzled as to why Parliamentarian Indika Anuruddha put the cap on because not only members of his family but several other businessmen were involved in the illegal mining exercise.
Addressing a press conference held at his Balagalle residence, Jayakody said, whatever it was, it was a shameful incident which occurred at the first meeting held by the committee for 2017. Unfortunately new excavations were included in the agenda of the meeting when it could have been easily taken up on another day.
All these years, politicians in Divulapitiya had engaged in their activities in a peaceful manner but this incident had added an unnecessary blot on the political scene. Jayakody said his intention was to join hands with both Ramanayake and Anuruddha, as well as all other political figures, and do a good job of work for the development of Divulapitiya. Earlier Ramanayake had a confrontation with the Divisional Secretary too regarding this matter. As politicians they should not descend to such low levels. Truly, there was a water scarcity problem in Divulapitiya. It is this problem which led to this incident. Mining of sand, clay and gravel was necessary to facilitate development work in the country. But there was a law in this country. Eventhrough some people had obtained permits they have gone beyond the stipulations to engage in unlawful things.
Some who obtained permits to excavate 100 cubes of gravel had exceeded it and excavated 10,000 cubes. Since the livelihood of a large number of people was dependent on land filling for a livelihood, a grave problem would arise soon unless damage to the environment was not stopped. However mining permits should not have been taken up for discussion that day they since not even an officer from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau was present at the meeting. Jayakody said he did not intend to point the finger of accusation at anyone. The finger of accusation should not be levelled at a single person. Jayakody said his request from the authorities concerned was to implement the law to the letter without any discrimination as to status or position.

We have different groups within the national government and they may have different opinions, he went onto explain and added that certain groups were trying to use this false information to create unrest and show that there is a problem with the security situation in the country.
The President gained votes of the North and East and at the same time, he is very focused on national security having survived several threats from the LTTE, the Chief Minister addressing a SLFP media briefing at SLFP Headquarters said.
These groups like the Northern Province Chief Minister is openly racist and is playing communal politics. But we in the South are living with all communities. In Colombo, the Muslims and the Tamils make up the majority but we have managed to win their confidence. We can no longer play ethnic politics, he said.

Sri Lankan Ambassador lauds students exchange programme between two countries
The Sri Lankan Ambassador in Germany hosted a luncheon at his residence for a group of students from Sri Lanka recently. He thanked the German school, Gymnasium Isernhagen, for the support they extended to conduct an exchange programme between Sri Lankan students and German students since year 2007.
Even though the first exchange programme took place in 2007, the relationship between Sri Lanka and Gymnasium Isernhagen runs back to Summer 1995, in which the first group of students from Gymnasium Isernhagen visited Sri Lanka with Manfred Mller, ( the teacher in charge and the chief organizer of the programme). From then on, every second year, a group of students from Germany have travelled to Sri Lanka.
Since 1997, German students who visited Sri Lanka has raised funds for charity projects to assist the needy people and the institutions in the country, including hospitals, schools and orphanages. One such project conducted by Gymnasium Isernhagen was rebuilding four destroyed houses after Tsunami in February and March 2005 (2 houses in Maggona and 2 houses in Payagala South) and building a home for Tsunami-affected children and other poor children in Weliweriya.
Gymnasium Isernhagen took the initiative in 2015 and 2016 in financing Reverse Osmosis plants, one plant was opened in 2015 at Kakuluwela Maha Vidyalaya, Dehiaththakandiya, Polonnaruwa and another one was opened in 2016 at Kebithigollawa Hospital.
The first exchange programme between Sri Lankan students from St. Thomas College (STC), Mount Lavinia and Gymnasium Isernhagen took place in 2007, for which Ladies College Colombo joined in 2009. Ever since, these two student exchanges have continued to take place every year.
There have been 20 exchanges between Gymnasium Isernhagen and the two Sri Lankan schools, St. Thomas College and Ladies College for which about 160 students from Sri Lanka have taken part since 2007. Around 260 students of Gymnasium Isernhagen have visited Sri Lanka between 1995 and 2017 under this exchange programme.
As a result of an initiative taken up by Manfred Mller, the three schools involved signed a partnership agreement in July 2016 during the visit of Mayor of Isernhagen Arpad Bogyar to Sri Lanka, who visited both schools for signing the documents.

Sri Lankan rhythm in Europe
This singer wanted to compose a different kind of song. He received many invitations from Sri Lankan artistes in Europe. As Miron Sri is based in Europe, he did not get an opportunity to receive those invitations. In the meanwhile one of his friends informs him about Ajith Kumarathanthris visit to Italy. Miron Sri invited him to his residence in Rome. In Rome, they discussed how to produce a new song. A trust is gradually built between the two singers.
Ajith Kumarathanthri went to Sri Lanka and sent me the melody and lyrics. The song is named as Anagathe Mata Inna Behe Tava. We did rehearsals for three months. Then only have we come to Sri Lanka, said Miron Sri.
The song is now telecast on FM channels drawing a good response from audiences. The visual essay will be released this month. Miron Sri intends to finish his second song before returning to Europe.
Miron Sri is among the top five winners of the International Superstar in Germany held in 2016. He enters the top five following a strong competition with a host of reputed countries. Miron Sri accredits his win to proper rehearsals done over the months.
He has already received a number of invitations to many concerts in Sri Lanka. For instance, he recently hosted a concert with Nelu Adhikari, Namal Udugama and Dayan Vitharana. He intends to visit Sri Lanka, his motherland, in future as well in order to present more songs.

Tokyo Cement partners The Music Project
Tokyo Cement has partnered with The Music Project, a non-profit initiative dedicated to empowering and uplifting the lives of children through music.
The partnership will see Tokyo Cement sponsoring three schools; two in Mullaitivu and another from Mawathagama, Kurunegala, to further their music education.
Nearly 140 students from Yohapuram MV and Therankandal MV of Mullaitivu, and 50 students from Gunananda MV of Kurunegala will benefit from this collaboration that will enhance their music education during the year 2017.
Speaking on the occasion of forming the funding partnership, S.R. Gnanam, Managing Director of Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC said, The Music Project aims to unite communities through children who love to learn music. By working with farming communities in the North and South of Sri Lanka who come from similar backgrounds, the project links these families who unanimously want to create better opportunities for their children, regardless of their race or religion.
At Therankandal MV in Mallavi, Mullaitivu currently 40 students practice during sessions conducted every Friday before the commencement of school. The heart-warming sight of young children accompanied by their parents from various walks of life, bustling to take their seats inside the meagre common room early morning is encouragement enough for the young teachers and volunteer instructors conducting the program.
The Music Project, inspired by El Sisitema of Venezuela, aims to create opportunities for children to learn music through holistic teaching methods. We hope that the programme is a stepping stone for the children to be able to make choices or simply avail of a passion, said Shalini Wickramasuriya, Trustee of The Music Project commenting on the benefits of the initiative.
Tokyo Cement comes forward as a sponsor this year, owing to their belief in building the foundation for tomorrows leaders through programs such as this that encourage children to explore the world using exciting new tools and not be limited by standardised education. Tokyo Cement has successfully integrated social welfare and environmental conservation into its corporate DNA and is on a continuous mission to enrich the country, its people and the environment.

On an ugly phenomenon
Recently the media went to town with a sensational discovery. A torture chamber run by University students was found in proximity to the University of Peradeniya. The academia and the clergy of all denominations as well as the civil society immediately reacted with universal condemnation. Not willing to be left out politicians also joined the chorus.
The phenomenon of ragging fresh batches of students has been prevailing in the University system for decades. Though brutal and inhuman instances of physical and mental torture were periodically reported the furor over such incidents died out with time and nobody cared further about it except the victims and their families.
Physical or mental torture
In the early days when University education was comparatively limited, students from elitist schools dominated and ragging was aimed at civilizing the uncultured village lads and lasses coming from not so affluent rustic families. Though degrading and humiliating treatment of freshly admitted students took place it was relatively of short duration, often confined to a week and rarely reached scandalous proportions.
With the expansion of secondary education and the increase in the number of University campuses the composition of the student body changed. Rural and middle class students became the majority. It is then the tables were turned. Ragging took a new form. Youth from less affluent families who lived in an oppressive environment hitherto found themselves free from such oppression inside the campuses and they found a golden opportunity to give expression to their animosity towards the elite and take revenge as a class. Unfortunately it was on their fellow students they vent their anger.
In time the duration and intensity of ragging increased. More instances of physical and mental torture became the norm. There were even instances in which students were disabled for life as a result of cruel forms of physical or mental torture. Some others unable to bear up the tension have left the university abandoning their academic pursuit. Though certain politicians and the alumni of the Universities sometimes refer to ragging as a manifestation of a sub-culture it is actually an expression of an authoritarian enforcement of crude egalitarianism and utopian socialism of a petty-bourgeois character. In doing so they also throw overboard historically developed humanitarian and cultural values of the people.
The survival of such a practice for so long shows the failure of measures taken so have failed so far to eliminate or control it. Both the government and the University authorities have heavily relied on legal and punitive measures to stop ragging. Just as the death penalty has been unable to prevent murder the anti-ragging legislation and the deterrent punishments prescribed have been unable to curtail it. It is time the authorities search for more productive methods instead of appealing to the armed forces and the judiciary for everything including the fight against the ubiquitous and tiny Ades aegypti mosquito.
It is easy to blame student community as a whole though only a minority group engages in ragging. Actually the rest are coerced into silence. It is necessary to answer the additional question why do they engage in this unwholesome practice
Obviously there is a fault in their upbringing. The responsibility falls not only on the students but also on their mentors parents and teachers as well as on the society at large.
There is no methodology for a continuous dialogue with the students on the need to respect the dignity of persons and their human rights, the latter being confined to lecture halls and seminar rooms at the most. The academic staff of the University has to share a major part of the blame for the present state of affairs.
Political intervention
Nor could the government and civil society wash their hands off the problem by blaming the students and teachers. Political intervention has destroyed the academic freedom of Universities and the system of political patronage given to yes-men of the ruling party has led to frustration among both teachers and students. It is no doubt that political groups also use the ragging season to enhance their following and their claims to be innocent bystanders could hardly convince those with first-hand experience of ragging. Student leaders also should be more sensitive to the plight of the hapless fresh students rather than giving into the pressure from the ragging leaders.
Further punishments on mass-scale and disproportionately severe have a tendency to unite both the victims and perpetrators in the struggle for their revocation so that finding a permanent solution to the recurrence of the ragging practice is forgotten till the next ragging session.
Intellectual and democratic dialogue
Universities are no longer centres of intellectual and democratic dialogue where innovative and creative thinking could flourish but closed chambers where only orthodox and hegemonic thought could survive. Hence restoration of university autonomy and the creation of a healthy atmosphere for intellectual and democratic dialogue would also contribute towards eliminating the unwholesome practice of raging.
Almost all political parties claim to uphold human rights and desist from practices that subject individuals or groups to cruel, inhuman or degrading treatment. Yet when their members or leaders commit such acts they wish to look the other way. Such hypocrisy should end. They should stand by what they publicly proclaim. The government should have a long-term plan for finding a permanent solution to this problem. One useful step would be the popularization of modern concepts of human rights and human dignity among the population. It could introduce human rights as a subject in the school curriculum together with other subjects that improve the civic understanding of students.
In its plan for eradicating ragging more attention, significance and priority should be given to prevention rather than punishing the guilty. This does not and should not however, mean excluding legal and punitive measures but relying on them only in the event of a failure of preventive strategies.

USN expands Pacific Partnership into SA with SL mission
The US Navy's (USN's) expeditionary fast transport ship (EPF) USNS Fall River (T-EPF-4) departed Singapore for the Southern Sri Lankan town of Hambantota on March 2, marking the first time that the series of humanitarian and disaster relief (HADR)-preparation exercises will be conducted in South Asia.
Involving more than 200 military and civilian personnel from Australia, Japan, South Korea, the United Kingdom, and the United States, the drills will be in their 12th iteration since 2006. Fall River will perform as the sole supporting ship - the first time that an EPF is being thrust into this role.
"As the navy buys more [EPF] platforms this is really a great opportunity to see how well we can execute this mission on this vessel", said Captain Stanfield Chien, Deputy Commodore of Coastal Riverine Group One and 'Pacific Partnership' mission commander, in response to questions from Jane's .
"In today's economy we all know budgets are very tough. So if we can properly execute and complete a mission like this, which is considerably less expensive than a hospital ship, but we still create the same effect and still build those relationships, then this is a very viable platform for the future," he added.
Besides multilateral HADR drills, 'Pacific Partnership' 2017 will also feature medical subject matter expert exchanges, civil engineering projects such as the rebuilding of schools and maternity hospitals, and medical symposiums.
"So this is a demonstration of that commitment that we have in this region, and we want to build those relationships and we want to be partners," Capt Chien emphasised in reference to the USN's presence in Asia Pacific. (IHS Janes)

Vulgar veg!
Keen gardeners are being urged to enter a vulgar vegetable contest - to grow Britains sauciest root crop. The edible misfits will include carrots, parsnips, swedes and spuds all turned into naughty shapes by nature.
The competition, organised by Suffolk-based seed giants Van Meuwen, will see a 500 prize going to the winner.
Van Meuwen spokesperson, Graham Ward, said: So-called wonky or imperfect vegetables have really caught the attention of the public - now supermarkets regularly stock produce that is not symmetrically perfect or blemish-free. So we are organising a competition and we hope gardeners will send in photos of their naughty veg - they dont have to have been grown from our seeds - and they dont have to be anatomically correct either.
It comes as supermarkets have revealed they have had to start rationing vegetable supplies because supplies in the Mediterranean have been battered by floods , snow and storms.
Morrisons has even imposed a limit of three iceberg lettuces and three heads of broccoli per customer, across each of its 492 UK stores.
Some Tesco shops are also carrying notices capping the number of lettuces to three per person.
While the big grocers online stores are restricting supply by listing some popular vegetables as unavailable.
The shortage began with aubergines and courgettes but has now spread to other vegetables, salad and, potentially, citrus fruit. Mirror

We should build a country where schools opened and prisons closed  President
It is the responsibility of the people to build a country where schools opened and prisons closed, healthy people are living, while the number of hospitals are minimised, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made these observations at a ceremony held on Wednesday to celebrate the 150th anniversary of St. Marys College in Kegalle.
He recalled the statement of Martin Luther King: The greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clamor of the bad people, but the appalling silence of the good people. He said intellectuals and great personalities should be born more to suppress the strident clamor of the bad people, he said.
The President commended the mission by the St Marys College which has a renowned history, to produce effective citizens to the country. He said the college which has good influence of the Thripitaka, Bible and the Koran is exemplary for the reconciliation process.
The President opened the educational and trade exhibition held to mark the 150th anniversary.
St. Marys College is one of the oldest boys schools in Sri Lanka, having a history of nearly 150 years. It was established in 1867 adjacent to St. Marys Church as a vernacular English school and came under the direction of Benedictine Missionaries.

World Hearing Day, today
Today is World Hearing Day and International Ear Care Day.
This years theme is Action for hearing loss: make a sound investment, Colombo National Hospital ENT Unit Head Consultant ENT Surgeon Dr. Chandra Jayasuriya said.
Addressing the press at the Colombo National Hospital ENT Unit yesterday, she said that about 400 infants born in Sri Lanka are suffering from hearing defects, annually. Infants born with hearing defects can be completely cured. They can be cured if treated early. Early detection saves lives, she said.
According to Dr. Jayasuriya, Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that carry out millions of rupees worth cochlear implant surgery, free of charge.
We need to get rid of negative attitudes towards those wearing hearing aids, she said.
Dr. Lakshman Gamlath said infants should be treated for hearing defects as early as possible since speech development ends at age five. Children speak only if they hear. Therefore, we have to make them hear before they turn five, he said.
