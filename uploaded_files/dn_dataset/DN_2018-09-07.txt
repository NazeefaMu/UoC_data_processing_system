Prime Minister at UNPs 72nd anniversary event
I HAVE GROOMED  NEXT LINE OF LEADERS
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday queried as to how a party which failed to hold a successful protest could run a country.
No protest can defeat a legally elected government, he said.
The Prime Minister said that he has groomed the next set of leaders who would take the United National Party forward adding that it was time for the party to look to the future beyond the 2020 elections.
I have groomed the next line of leaders who would take on the party as it is time for the party to now think of its future beyond the 2020 elections, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the 72nd anniversary of the party at its headquarters in Sirikotha. The Prime Minister referring to the failed attempt by the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) to hold its Jana Balaya which was hailed as an attempt to topple the government, said that the party lost what little support it had from the people whilst the media has lost its credibility for giving it amplified publicity.
The other day, I received a few phone calls and most of them asked if we should postpone todays event, the UNPs 72nd anniversary, because the SLPP had threatened to take over the city of Colombo and topple the government, he said.
I told them to allow the SLPP to do as they wished and we would go ahead as planned. Today, I ask you what was historic about September 5th
We need to strengthen the party while the party is at work building the nation, he said.
The UNP will not stop here, we will take our mandate forward, we will build this party from the grass roots upwards and we will clinch the leadership, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
This country, when we took over,was comparable to a neglected paddy field, he said.
We took it over at a very tough period, but regardless of the setbacks, weve toiled hard, weve braved the storms, the floods and now is time to reap the harvests, he said to resounding applause from the party members and supporters.
It wasnt the UNP which called for elections too early, he said. The former government could no longer stay in power, they had to go. They were defeated, the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister said it was a government led by the UNP which finally met with banks that lent to this government, worked to regain the GSP+ preference and even with the existing financial constraints, increased the mahapola scholarship from Rs. 2500 to Rs. 4000.
We introduced an emergency ambulance service, an insurance scheme for all school children and we also gave leadership for women to enter politics, he said.

Protect environment to save everyone
The environment must be protected. Then it will protect us. It is changing all the time because the ways we live, travel, produce and consume goods evolve, Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited (EFL) Director Dr. Sewandi Jayakody said.
She was addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday. She said flora and fauna in Sri Lanka are in jeopardy because of deforestation, climate change and pollution.
We had a rich biodiversity. But we are now under threat of natural disasters. We must carry out a comprehensive dialogue in society on these issues, she said.
We must protect our aquatic lives. Many die entangling in fishing nets, she said.
Aquatic plants and lives along the coastal belt become extinct at an alarming rate. When these things happen, ecology changes, she said.
Migratory birds fly to Sri Lanka through Mannar. What would happen if windmills were built in Mannar she asked.
During droughts, farmers in the dry zone cultivate dried lakes using pesticides and weedcides. Once the rainy season comes, what would happen to those who drink such water she asked.
The EFL is committed to safeguard environmental rights and protect it legally. Twelve court cases are in progress now against violators of environmental laws, she said.
Government Information Director General Sudarshana Gunawardhana said the country should follow sustainable development to protect environment. Journalist have a major role to play in educating the public in this regard, he said.

AI used to predict chances  of recovery from brain trauma
Chinese researchers and doctors have built an artificial intelligence model that uses medical imaging to help determine whether patients with severe brain damage might regain consciousness.
Severe brain injury can lead to disorders of consciousness, or DOC, which are characterized by changes in the level of awareness.
Some patients can recover from an acute brain injury, but others fall into chronic DOC, which is also known as a vegetative state. They cannot communicate or act consciously.
China has more than 500,000 patients with chronic DOC caused by brain trauma, stroke and other brain diseases, with 70,000 to 100,000 new cases each year. Most patients are bedridden and require laborious care, bringing great stress and heavy costs to their families.
Most doctors assess the chances of recovery according to three main indicators: the patients age; the cause of the disorder; and the duration of the disorder. Studies have shown that patients with traumatic brain injury have a higher likelihood of recovery than those with nontraumatic brain injury, and young patients are more likely to have a favorable outcome than older ones. Doctors also observe patients actions, with tests such as clapping hands or tracking eyes, to identify evidence of awareness.
However, behavioral assessments are subjective and vulnerable to personal interpretation. For doctors, a lack of experience, poor training or ignorance of a patients other health problems can cause misjudgments, said Song Ming, a researcher of the study.
Researchers from the Chinese Academy of Sciences Institute of Automation, along with doctors from the Peoples Liberation Army General Hospital and the General Hospital of Guangzhou Military Command, spent five years developing an AI model that can make an assessment based on images of brain functional networks.
When a brain functions, multiple brain regions are involved, and they form a network, working together. Like two mobile phones, though no actual wire links them, they have a functional connection when people make a phone call, Song said.
A medical imaging technique known as resting state functional MRI has been widely used in recent years to study the brain functions of DOC patients. Through MRI scanning, Song and his colleagues found typical features seen in the brain functional networks of DOC patients, which can be biomarkers to trace the level of consciousness and predict the possibility of recovery. To train the AI, developers fed it tens of thousands of brain images from 63 DOC patients at least one month after sustaining a brain injury, said Jiang Tianzi, the lead researcher.
The model diagnosed patients who would recover consciousness and those who would not with an accuracy of 88 percent in 100 cases.
The research was recently published in the international journal eLife.
Reviewers of the journal were impressed by the sample size used in the paper, but Jiang said more data will be needed to confirm the validity and reliability of the model.
We believe the model can make an accurate assessment and might help families of DOC patients understand the outcomes in advance and make an informed decision, Jiang said.
It is not the first AI technology to help doctors. (Chinadaily.com)

Bangladesh ready for massive foreign investment
The confidence of foreign investors in Bangladesh has increased, as the country has taken a series of measures to: build up investment-friendly infrastructure; develop the energy sector; provide necessary facilities and support to set up industries; and simplify rules and regulations.
Under the leadership of Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, the inflow of foreign direct investment (FDI) to the country has almost tripled during ruling Awami Leagues nine years in office.
Central bank data shows Bangladesh received $961 million in fiscal year 2008-09, while FDI inflow increased to $2,454.81 million in FY16-17. The country received $2,607 millions-worth of foreign investment from July to May in FY17-18, according to the latest data of Bangladesh Bank (BB).
According to economists, stakeholders, and regulators, Bangladesh has been able to attract the increasing amount of FDI thanks to consistent policy support from the government.
In his budget speech in June, Finance Minister AMA Muhith said that the government has seriously reviewed failures to attract FDI and taken steps to identify the obstacles, as well as take necessary action, to overcome them.
He said, I firmly believe that with the ushering in of a stable and advanced economy after 2015 we were able to attract more foreign investment.
He mentioned: the introduction of the One-Stop Service, performing well in the Ease of Doing Business Indicator, establishing the Bangladesh Economic Zones Authority (BEZA), and the Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA)as a part of developing an environment for investment.
One of the pre-conditions for rapid economic development is increased investment. We are gradually increasing public investment. However, the purpose of this investment is to create an investment-friendly environment for the private sector as well as attract foreign direct investment, he said.
The availability of electricity, gas and water connections, timely processing of investment proposals, availability of undisputed land, etc., play a crucial role in attracting investment, said the finance minister adding, We have enacted a number of laws and regulations to make these services easily available to the investors.

Big band beats
A Competition organized by the Nalanda College Old Boys Association (NCOBA) to crown the best brass band of Sri Lanka will be held in Polgolla, Kandy on September 9. The competition will be held in district and provincial level. The final 50 bands will be showcased in a reality TV show.
The brass band dates back to the early nineteenth century and Englands Industrial Revolution as an outgrowth of the medieval waits. With increasing urbanization, employers began to finance work bands to decrease the political activity with which the working classes seemed preoccupied during their leisure time. Thus, the brass band tradition was founded. Fervent discussion has always ensued as to which band was founded first. Certainly the two bands with the longest traditions are the Bessies 0' The Barn Brass Band and the Black Dyke Mills Brass Band.
School bands are usually a sight at ceremonial events within the school or at public performances outside the school as they provide the music for various occasions. In addition, school bands also participate in competitions at both local and international music festivals. As students undergo the process of rehearsing in the band, either for foot drills or music drills, the disciplined routines allow them to learn the values of discipline, teamwork, responsibility and commitment. As they participate in competitions, students also learn to celebrate their achievements while maintaining humility or even to accept defeat in good grace. These are experiences that members of the school bands gain through participation.
As such, school bands act as platforms that develop potential young musicians, among which a significant number of whom would have gone on to pursue a professional music career. There are amateur and semi-professional bands and orchestras, national bodies, or even professional organizations where students can go on to involve themselves in. The number of students who continue to pursue professional music careers are their experience in the school bands can perhaps be an indicator of development in the area of culture and arts scene.
The musical standard that school bands have reached today can be exemplified in the recognized international competitions and events that some school bands have been invited to participate in. One example would be the Sydney Olympics Games Opening Ceremony held in Australia in 2000, when six Singaporean school band members were selected to participate in the international band display item.
So far more than 3,000 school band islandwide have registered for the competition.

Blending flavours
Juliet Coombe tries tumeric latter and learns about the perfect artisan brews from the master and mistress of blending coffee and tea at the Edgcumbe-Rendle Roastery Caf.
Growing up in India, Chris Edgcumbe-Rendle, now a master roaster and blending aficionado, loved trying out different teas from a young age, blending them together in his jungle book life, which was the envy of all his friends back in England.
It was of no surprise to them when he became a coffee and tea master chef of blending and roasting, which is the result of decades of training with the best, tasting endless styles from around the world and having a passion for mixing and blending different varieties to create exciting new drinks. In the case of coffee, much of the taste is due to the variety of bean, as well as down to the roasting process, which is quite an art form  no two roasts are the same, given that ambient elements also play their part. On our tour of the Roastery which lies directly opposite the cafe, we were given some Colombia El Calapo green beans (in effect, coffee seeds) to grow and were let into how Chris and his wife, Alice, quietly, after over three decades of passion, have grown a huge fan base of ardent coffee and tea lovers. Followers love it so much they will detour on their way to and from London to try the latest blend and to pick up some bags of their signature blend that comes with tasting notes. Their multi-award-winning house coffee, Sussex Barn blend, has a great taste profile of berries, spice and chocolate.
Of course, behind every talented artisan blender is a James Bond style business partner, Alice Rendle, who designed the stunning branding at the EDGE cafe, complete with family dog as part of the logo. Like her husband, she is also on her own personal crusade to get back to the good old days when we cooked slowly, and everyone stopped to talk about things while drinking loose leaf tea. She firmly believes that this will help save the planet by encouraging people to stop using tea bags with plastic in, which adds to our rubbish mountains and affects health. Making tea, she explains, is always best the old school way as it brings out the best flavours and colours, which she proves pouring different mixtures of camomile, fennel and rose petals into a tasting glass, and then says, with a sparkle in her eyes, happy sipping. The true golden colour is a magical Aladdin and the Lamp type experience and all the more fun as she explains all the tea making paraphernalia on the shelves of the shop, which are also on sale online at www.edgcumbes.co.uk and in the EDGE Caf, The Old Barn, Ford Lane near Arundel castle, West Sussex.
Chris, as he takes us round the Roastery, explains how his first big break was working for James Finlays of London, one of the biggest tea producers in the world, with responsibility for buying Ceylon teas to go into Sainsburys Green Label, which resulted in him spending an exciting year in Sri Lanka, at the Colombo auction houses at the age of 20, where he would do the tasting for up to 400 different teas in a day. Going back to live in Asia in 1970 was his idea of heaven as he could indulge in street hoppers and spicy sambal while learning from the islands finest tea makers. So he could identify the different tea tastes, he sipped milk between each batch to neutralise the taste of the last one and then put a brokers price on it. Like his father who founded Edgcumbes Coffee Roasters and Tea Blenders in 1981, he grew to love tea mixology and has never looked back from his four exciting years with Finlays, whose bush-to-cup success goes back to 1750 when tea became all the rage as a result of the golden age of trade. He also fell in love with the coffee bean process after several exciting years in Kenya, applying the knowledge that the mix is the key to any award-winning drink.
As we watched the coffee roasting machine turn through the sea of beans, taking out small stones and discussed the incredible range of blends, Chris explained proudly, Our company now spans two generations, and when Frank Edgcumbe-Rendle my dad retired from his job as a jute and tea trader in Calcutta (now Kolkata) and moved back to the UK, he was distraught to discover he couldnt find any decent loose-leaf tea and so he sat at the kitchen table with a set of scales and blended some high-quality Assam and Kenyan tea leaves together. He called the blend Rusper, after the West Sussex village where he grew up, and decided to sell a few packets, calling the newly formed company Edgcumbes  his traditional family name with lots of Cornish/Devon Celtic connections. The couple believes, along with their dynamic young team, that locally, fresh-roasted coffees and hand-blended loose-leaf teas always taste better than commercially packaged products. Combine this with the voodoo of the setting, entertaining staff, quirky sustainable furnishings and a philosophy of bring your own take-away cup for a discount. If you have more time, of course stay and learn for a while about this fascinating business in the sun drenched courtyard - here regulars talk about where the seasonal range of five or six coffee styles come from on their travels, many of them have taken the time to enjoy one of their many amazing courses that are done in a superb teaching area next to the EDGE caf.
Asked about the future, both Chris and Alice are excited by the prospect of travelling the world together while sourcing and learning about ever more blends, roasting techniques and whatever else might go with coffee and tea. A little tipple of something stronger, now and again, also, wouldnt go amiss. So far their travels have taken them to Colombia, Costa Rica, Vietnam and Kenya.
Get in touch with Edgcumbes, and you might have an opportunity to try Christophers other business, Rendles Original Pink Gin, created by his father while fighting in the 16th Light Cavalry in India during World War 2. Captain Frank Edgcumbe-Rendle, to deal with the horrors of war, created his own secret recipe by adding spices and herbs from the Orient and made sure he knew it was his bottle of gin by adding Hibiscus for its pink colouring. Rendles Original Gin now the talk of the American and Canadian people, Christopher believes it's time to take it back to where it all started -Asia as its infusion and story is all about the magic and mystique of the Orient. As Serendipity has it, Alice and Christopher are going next on their travels to research more of a range of Sri Lankan teas and no doubt add to their already very exciting blends, which you can buy in their delightful artisan caf shop. For them travelling to different places is important as you can never stop learning or discovering new exciting things. So next time you have a coffee or tea sit back as you sip it and think what it took to grow, blend and turn it into the drink most of us consume as much as water.

Brandix Model Village provides  access to sanitation projects
Nearly 50,000 people in 16 towns across Sri Lanka received better access to water and sanitation facilities at public institutions they visit, work or study in, as a result of an inspired community initiative executed in 2017-18 by Brandix, the countrys single largest apparel exporter.
The Brandix Model Village program, which serves communities located within both a five-kilometer and ten-kilometer radius of the Groups factories, engaged in the construction and donation of 74 water supply or sanitation projects to schools, hospitals, police stations, community centres and places of religious worship during the year 2017  2018.
The areas benefitted through these projects included Katunayake, Ekala, Giritale, Rideegama, Seeduwa, Batticaloa, Kahawatte, Koggala, Rambukkana, Ratmalana, Avissawella, Minuwangoda, Mirigama, Welisara, Pannala and Wathupitawala, locations that are home to 22 Brandix factories.
The Brandix Model Village program is inspired by the temple, school and tank-centered village development concept, and initially identified and addressed water and sanitation related needsof people resident within a five-kilometer radius of Brandix factories.
The second phase, embarked upon in 2017-18, extended its reach beyond the five-kilometer radius to ten-kilometers, tohelp 38 schools, 19 places of worship, seven hospitals, and four police stations,while also ensuring the completion of six standalone community projects. Commenting on the Brandix Model Village program, Anusha Alles, Head of Corporate Social Responsibility of the Brandix Group, said:Inspiring communities by improving their quality of life with access to clean water and sanitation has been the central theme of our Corporate Social Responsibility agenda since the very beginning. The very visible impact of the first phase of the Brandix Model Village program inspired a ripple-like extension that we hope will continue to benefit more and more people every year, and lead, ultimately to the elimination of the many issues faced by communities in areas where Brandix has factories.
Since the inception of the Brandix Model Village program in 2015, the company has helped alleviate water related problems faced by more than 161,000 people with a total of 234 community water supply and sanitation projects.
The Brandix Model Village program focuses on assisting public institutions and communal locations by bringing communities together and building a sense of ownership that has lasting beneficial impacts. These projects enable the Groups factories to play a role in the community, and become important contributors to the wellbeing of the people in their neighbourhoods.
As a result, Brandix factories, which are usually among the biggest employers in the beneficiary communities, become an intrinsic part of the social fabric of the villages and towns assisted under the program.

Can dogs think like humans
Ever wondered what your dog thinks of you as a parent or the barrage of commands you shout at it all day Can dogs actually process information and does their brain function like that of humans
Dogs can think and they do undergo cognitive processes.
Dr. Jill Sackman, has a PhD in cellular and molecular biology and has confirmed the fact that dogs can think. Dr. Sackman a clinician in behavioral medicine and a senior medical director of BluePearl veterinary Partners Michigan hospitals further believes that a dogs level of cognition is same as that of a human child aged between three to five years.
Cognition is the mental action or process of acquiring knowledge and understanding through practice, thinking and senses. Some cognitive processes are problem solving, decision making, memory, knowledge, evaluation, comprehension and attention. In day to day lives a dog comes across situations that require it to make choices, evaluate a condition or follow commands of the owner. A dog can recognize and respond to familiar voices/people. It can sense danger or an enemy. It will be comfortable around those it considers friends. A canine brain can function quite well and to test the same if you put two food bowls in front of your dog, it will be able to gauge the one with more food in it.
Dogs are creatures of habit, they like to follow a fixed schedule when it comes to daily dog exercise and being fed. All of these activities, reactions and habits point out that a dog can definitely think! However there is still little known about what exactly goes on in a canine mind and how their brain processes/understands information. As rightly put by Dr. Rachel Barrack of Animal Acupuncture in New York City, Just as its impossible to read another persons thoughts, it is impossible to speculate exactly what a dog is thinking.
A dog brain is quite similar to the human brain
MRI studies not only point out structural similarities but also the fact that in human and canine brain the same sections light up when reacting to things/events/stimuli. Scientists have also found out that certain skill sets come together in dogs the same way it is with humans. This has been explained by Dr. Sackman by citing the example that a dog that is fast and accurate in one task will be agile and accurate at another chore as well. In a human brain too some cognitive skills are bunched together. If a person is found to be good at mathematics, he/she in all probability will be good at problem solving as well.
A condition similar to Alzheimers disease is found to develop in aged dogs. Also the way humans respond to fear or process memories, is similar to dogs. Dogs also have a sense of spatial awareness that is the ability to be aware of not just oneself but also other objects in a given space.

Dogs are creatures of habit, they like to follow a fixed schedule when it comes to daily exercise and being fed. All of these activities, reactions and habits point out that a dog can definitely think!.
However the size of a dogs brain is smaller than ours in relation to the respective body size. Dr. JP McCue is a board-certified veterinary neurologist at NYCs Animal Medical Center and has highlighted a few other dissimilarities like the human brain has more surface area due to the presence of more folds. Also the prefrontal cortex (PFC) in humans is greatly developed as compared to in dogs. PFC covers the front part of the frontal lobe and is responsible for the regulation of complex cognitive, emotional and behavioural functioning and it is here the higher level of thoughts happen.
Dogs have emotions and canunderstand humans
A dogs ability to express emotions is same as that of a two and a half year old human child. It is capable of feeling and communicating emotions such as excitement and joy, jealousy, suspicion, shyness, distress and sorrow, disgust, anger, fear, contentment, love and affection.
Since time immemorial dogs have been amiably living around human species and are the oldest domesticated animal. In the course of co-existing and evolving together dogs have come to understand humans and communicate with them effectively by picking up cues via body language, familiarity of voices and smells. Dogs have extremely sensitive noses and use a larger part of their brains for identifying and examining smells around them. Dr. Rachel Barrack believes that dogs link scent with memories.
Yes! Your Dog Can Communicate With You, Say Veterinarians
Your pet dog can talk to you, however sans words! The conversations can happen only if you are able to read dogs body language and the sounds it makes.
Scientists are continuously working to unravel significant and deeper facts about dog-thinking and cognitive processes with newer breakthroughs to be made.

For series versus India
Chamari Atapattu returns to lead SL Women
Chamari Atapattu returns to lead Sri Lanka Womens 15-member squad for the three Womens Championship matches against India starting September 11 in Galle.
Atapattu, the teams most prolific batsman, missed the teams previous international assignment - the Asia Cup T20 in June - with dengue, but has since recovered and featured in a full Womens Super League season for Yorkshire Diamonds.
Among the new faces, batsman Imalka Mendis has returned to the ODI squad for the first time in more than two years, while the selectors have also retained 17-year-old allrounder Kavisha Dilhari, who made her ODI debut against Pakistan.
Overall, the selectors have retained 10 players from Sri Lankas 2017 World Cup campaign, showing their push for continuity as they build towards the next four-year cycle under new coach Harsha de Silva. The former first-class cricketer was appointed on a two-year contract last month following Hemantha Devapriyas resignation.
Sri Lanka are currently placed eighth and are winless in six Womens Championship matches - against Pakistan and West Indies. They have now lost 12 of their last 13 ODIs, a streak that stretches back to last years World Cup.
India, runners up in that tournament, are currently sixth, having won two of their six matches.
Galle will host the first two ODIs, on September 11 and 13, before the series moves to the Moors Cricket Club ground on the outskirts of Colombo for the final match on September 16.
The teams will then play five T20Is to round off the tour.
SRI LANKA SQUAD: Chamari Attapattu (captain), Prasadani Weerakkody, Anushka Sanjeewani, Nipuni Hansika, Hasini Perera, Dilani Manodara, Shashikala Siriwardena, Nilakshi De Silva, Imalka Mendis, Sripalee Weerakkodi, Sugandika Kumari, Inoka Ranaweera, Udeshika Prabodhini, Ama Kanchana, Kavisha Dilhari.

Citizens' Mail
Bring contractors to justice
The Hansard on July 19 (435  449 pp) exposed the payment details, with cheque numbers, of the colossal sums that a particular Chinese contractor had given at Temple Trees manoeuvring politics and elections for the pursuance of acquiring public money through unofficial contract benefits a few years ago.
Such cheque details of the cheque payments with its respective issuers names of the contractors were tabled in the parliament. Those cheques were given not only by the Chinese contractors. Additional cheque payments details with cheque numbers are available with regards to the local road construction contractors. The aim was to garner undue benefits from contracts on the peoples account. It was stressed in the parliament that those payments which are considered as de-facto bribes and also election violations shall have to be investigated by the government.
In establishing sincere good governance by the Yahapalanaya government which is aspired by the people, the referred colossal amount of payments that had been handed over surreptitiously at the Temple Trees which is the Supreme Officiate of the country not only by the Chinese contractor but also by several undue privileged local contractors as well needs to be found out. That phenomenon has given undue advantages out of the public money from construction contracts. This shall have to be investigated by the Bribery and Corruption Commissioner and should be subject to judiciary action.
It is also the responsibility of the business chambers in the construction industry along with their professionals who are supposed to administer the contracts in the construction industry and specially the National Construction Association of Sri Lanka under its regulations of good practices to be adhered by their member contractors to take necessary disciplinary action on such bad practices of their members who are thwarting the advancement and protection of the private sector good governance and to mitigate such bad practices in the construction industry.
The truth is such practices are the common phenomenon among the contractors. During the past it was a common practice to pay commissions and enhance their estimates in the contract value by provisioning of additional percentage for commissions and other emoluments for the benefits of the higher officers as well as to the hierarchy as well as local level politicians and also to so-called technical committee experts of respected gentlemen professionals who are liaison with politicians of central governance as well as of their cronies.
There were instances in the past in the construction industry that their regulatory body, the government respected office premises was also used on the eve of general elections as venues of congregating such contractors having meetings with the politicians in organising such election campaigns. This menace has to be stopped by their own business associations and chambers and by other regulatory institutions and should not be condoned by the private sector business chambers in order to fortify and to establish the prevalence of democracy and good governance in the country as well for a healthy stable growth of private sector driven economy which is essentially needed for a better society.

## Title: DISCOURAGING UNCONSCIONABLE STRIKES
## Supertitle:

## Date: Friday, September 7, 2018 - 01:00
DISCOURAGING UNCONSCIONABLE STRIKES
The citizens of this country are utterly disappointed by the governments pusillanimous responses to the profusion of unconscionable strikes that are called by various groups that cause immense inconvenience and hardship, loss of time and money, and even deprivation of life and limb of fellow citizens. The timing and nature of most of the strikes that have taken place over the past 3-4 years indicate that the motivation behind them is less the direct self-interest of the strikers and more the unscrupulous political objectives of their leaders.
The first step that must be taken to deal with strikes by State employees is for the President and the Prime Minister to act together in a manner that is consistent with their powerful but interdependent positions. They must stop pussy-footing in the face of threats by crooked strike leaders whose demands get more and more outrageous in the face of hesitant governmental responses.
They should cut down severely on their excessive overseas visits, most of which have contributed little or no perceptible benefit to Sri Lanka and, instead, spend more time to deal constructively to stop strikes taking place. Most of all, they have to cooperate with each other and not allow anything they say or do to undermine the position of the other, however subtly such things are done. There could be nothing more advantageous to their common opponents than to see these two powerful entities back-stabbing each other whilst uncontrolled strikes continue to destroy any semblance of serious governance and economic growth.
Giving in to the demands presented by one group of strikers often leads to a domino-type succession of fresh strikes called by other groups trying to get to the head of the queue. Piecemeal solutions given to strikers demands almost automatically sow the seeds of an unwelcome harvest of new strikes. Therefore, if one wishes to forestall the domino effect of a settlement of one groups grievances leading to an immediate call by some other group to make corresponding enhancements of its own remuneration and benefits, it would be imperative to have a comprehensive, balanced, legally-enforceable, overall schedule of remuneration and benefits covering all employee classifications. If ones memory is to be relied upon, about two decades ago, Tissa Devendra was appointed to head a committee that was tasked with working out an equitable system of grading and rewarding all public servants. Unfortunately, political stupidity brought this exercise to a premature halt.
Committees report
President Sirisena has now appointed a high-powered committee to do something on similar lines before the end of October this year. Whereas this is a commendable move, it is doubtful whether the views of all affected parties could be collected and evaluated objectively for inclusion in the committees report within the short time available. Consequently, there is bound to be a need soon thereafter for clarification and amplification of the proposals that the new committee may be expected to put forward.
In the circumstances, apart from what is being done hurriedly, legislation should be brought in to classify all State employment as being of a fundamentally essential character so that all those in State employment shall be bound by certain overall rules that would ensure conformity with this concept. There should be a formal mechanism for examining, within a specified time frame, all claims that could lead to strike action and a strict procedure set out to be followed both by potential strikers and by the government to help arrive at a timely solution.
It is plain common-sense that the absence of employees in any department whatsoever of government at a time when they should be at work inevitably results in wasted effort, wasted time and wasted money for members of the public who require official inputs of a thousand different kinds. Delays in securing official endorsement and approvals could mean that affected citizens could, in certain situations, suffer life-changing reverses. Any responsible person could readily envisage the damaging impact of such setbacks in countless critical situations.
If the principle that all public servants are essential is enforced, any of them going on strike, without following clearly set out procedures for resolving whatever claims they may put forward from time to time, would be a violation of their terms of employment and a serious anti-social act for which there should be deterrent punishment. In this context, the most effective disincentive that would inhibit trade unions and other organised groups from breaking contracts irresponsibly or with an illegitimate collateral purpose would be the confiscation of property of not only the leaders of the illegally-striking unions or similar groupings but the individual strikers as well. Most specifically, any demand that is not strictly and solely related to the legitimate welfare of the strikers alone should be made a crime. In the current context, the most glaring example of a trade union that insists on blackmailing the government and the people of Sri Lanka to accommodate the political agendas of its leaders rather than the protection of the rights of its members is the Government Medical Officers Union (GMOA). We have, in an earlier article, equated its methods with those of the LTTE and ISIS whose principal weapon of persuasion involved putting the lives of innocent civilians in extreme peril. The GMOAs methodology has worsened in the interim.
It would, of course, not be enough to have a wide-ranging document that assigns pay scales and perquisites in keeping with the qualifications, special skills, age limits, work experience, physical risks faced, uncongenial conditions of work and so on. There would need to be appropriate complementary documents that set out the conditions of service and the rules to be observed, individually and collectively, by all employees to resolve administrative errors and unjust treatment. There is already a large volume of official rules and regulations and all that would be required would be the careful revision and editing of this material to suit the new mechanism and procedures.
State employees
Although all State employment must, without exception, be classified as essential, it would be necessary, for practical reasons, to subdivide the types of services rendered by State employees into three broad categories and to adjust the remuneration and conditions of employment in keeping with the different responsibilities, risks and hours of work that each category would have to take on, as briefly outlined below.
Category 1 of the essential services would be those whose place of work and the number of hours to be worked are those that would apply to those engaged almost exclusively in administrative or other regular work. They would not be exposed to any significant work-related risks. About the only time that they would be called upon to work outside their offices and routine rounds would be if and when they are called upon to perform election duties.
Category 2 of the essential services would be those whose working hours are controlled by time-tables, as in the transport business, or who have to work shifts to run public utilities such as the supply, distribution and maintenance of electricity, water and so on during nights, weekends, public holidays etc. Moreover, some doctors, some nurses, most customs officials and immigration officials may also fit into this classification.
Category 3 would be those who not only have to work in the areas of maintaining law and order, fire-fighting, armed services and so on, but are often called upon to work irregular, long hours and occasionally face risk of death and injury from criminals, terrorists, protestors, strikers and other sources. Bomb disposal is another speciality within this group.
In summary, all government employment must be considered to be essential. There needs to be a comparative evaluation of the degree of disruptiveness to the life of the employee that would be inherent in the many different types of jobs in government service and appropriate categorization should be worked out on the lines suggested above.
An overall organisational structure and corresponding rewards should be fashioned so as to match the combination of qualifications, experience, responsibilities, working hours, job-related risks and so on to help assign suitable positions in government service to the different categories.
There must be a streamlined mechanism and simple procedures to solve differences between the state and its employees without allowing any wounds to fester out of control indefinitely, especially by Ministers who procrastinate because they do not possess the skills to deal with human resources problems.

Dutch period tombs unearthed in Galle Fort
Some tombs presumably believed to be of the Dutch period was unearthed during archaeological excavations at an old building site belonging to the Galle Municipal Council.
The site located at Peddler Street in Galle Fort was identified as an old grave yard used during the period from 1710 to 1850. Later the Galle Municipal Council had constructed several official residences on the site dispatching a number of tomb stones to the Reformist Church also located in Galle Fort.
However, this site with an archeological value was leased to an entrepreneur by the Galle Municipal Council to construct a tourist hotel.
Southern Province Assistant Director of Archeology Wasantha Alahakoon said they had not permitted the entrepreneur to demolish the existing old buildings and instead directed him to construct new buildings behind the old constructions without harming them.
We asked them to preserve the old buildings and maintain them. The person who obtained the land on lease submitted a building plan to the Municipal Planning Committee. Before granting permission to build new constructions, we are exploring the site and make arrangements to preserve everything on the site that has archeological value,Alahakoon said.

English matters in business
In this modern technological world communication plays a massive role in successful business. English is widely used for business communication. The English language used for business communication is different from the General or Regular English which is used for our day to day communication. As we all know, the business men mostly use the professional English that is distinctly different from the ordinary language.
In that case a business man should possess the capacity to take General English and upgrade it to business English and on certain occasions the business man should handle the language more creatively in order to make a powerful impression among their clients.
We can manifest that particular difference by looking at different verbs, adjectives and nouns and so on. Let us have a look at these eight verbs and weigh the differences in the normal and professional situations and also how it is used in different collocation or combination of words. (see table 1)
It is very easy to note the differences between the General English and Business English from the above chart. The first sentence in General English I need to find out whats wrong it is in the Business English I need to identify the problem so the key verb used in the professional English is identify likewise we can compare and contrast the differences of other rest of the sentences, moreover in certain occasions
the business man supposed to use higher or quality words so as to keep the standard communication or maintain high profile business culture.

FACETS 2018  the glamour of Sri Lanka
The FACETS Gem and Jewellery Exhibition 2018 brought together the best gem and jewellery manufacturers of the island under one roof. The 28th chapter of the exhibition was held for four days giving access to the general public to see, study and purchase gem and jewellery within a range of products from precious to semi-precious stones, and gold, silver to costume jewellery.
FACETS is organized by the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association with the support of the National Gem and Jewellery Authority and Export Development Board. Throughout the years the exhibition has become a platform for small and medium gem and jewellery manufacturers and traders to showcase their ware to a mass of local and international audience. The presence of foreign delegates has added value to FACETS, making it a truly international exposure for Sri Lanka.
The opening ceremony was attended by Minister of Science, Technology, Skills Development and Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Dr. Sarath Amunugama. The highlight of the ceremony was the launch of the coffee table book Sri Lanka Gems by Vladyslav Yavorskyy, an internationally renowned gemologist and author of Terra Spinel: Terra Firma, Terra Garnet and Terra Connoisseur.
The exhibition showcased many of Sri Lankas gem and jewellery manufacturers as well as several international stalls. The gems varied from precious to semi-precious to coloured stones, attracting buyers from all levels. Purchasing a gem is an investment which has a very low risk in depreciation. The varied value levels of the stones enable the buyer to make an investment within ones budget. FACETS was a platform to compare, evaluate and purchase gems, as well as a great opportunity to learn about mining, cutting, polishing and value adding of gems. The complete process from mine to market was displayed for those interested in learning about the industry.
The jewellery zone ranged from high value gold to silver to creative costume pieces, once again catering to all levels of jewellery lovers. The small and medium manufacturers under the National Gem and Jewellery Authority as well as the Export Development Board received significant exposure in bringing out their products to the market. Visitors were also able to make use of the opportunity to evaluate the jewellery they bout or already owned at the valuation counters.

Fitch affirms National Insurance Trust Fund at AA-(lka)
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based National Insurance Trust Fund Boards (NITF) National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating and National Long-Term Rating at AA-(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
The affirmation reflects the companys strong domestic business profile, conservative investment mix as well as strong financial performance and capitalisation. This is partly offset by volatility in profitability and capitalisation over the previous 15 months due to back-to-back natural disasters and high claims.
Fitch believes NITF has a strong domestic business profile, which is underpinned by its role as the countrys only reinsurer, its well-established exclusive product lines, its function as an arm of the state in implementing policies, its full government ownership and a mandate requiring all domestic non-life operators to cede 30% of their reinsurance to NITF.
NITFs strong capitalisation is reflected in its risked-based capital (RBC) ratio of 314% as at end-June 2018 (2017: 255%, 2016: 385%), which is well above the 120% regulatory minimum. However, capitalisation has been highly volatile since mid-2017 due to natural disaster-related losses and large dividend payments to the state. We believe the insurers capital position may come under pressure if it continues to pay high dividends during periods of increasing frequency of large natural catastrophes. NITF paid out 146% and 113% of profits as dividends to the state in 2017 and 2016, respectively.
NITF has a strong financial performance and earnings. Its combined ratio improved to 74% in 1H18, after temporarily deteriorating to 100% in 2017 (2016: 79%), owing to high net claims from floods in May 2016 and May 2017 and a prolonged drought in several parts of the country.

Fitch assigns Co-operative  Insurance First-Time BBB+(lka) Rating; Outlook Stable
Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka-based Co-operative Insurance Company Limited (CICL) a National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating and National Long-Term Rating of BBB+(lka). The Outlook is Stable.
The rating reflects the non-life insurers modest domestic business profile, supported by its association with co-operative societies, good capitalisation and a somewhat conservative investment policy. CICLs rating is also supported by its consistently strong financial performance and earnings.
We view CICL as a niche player in the domestic market with a modest non-life market share by gross written premium (GWP) of 3.2% at end-2017 (2016: 3.0%).
The insurer is 99.9% owned by 203 co-operative societies that together represent several multi-purpose co-operative organisations and rural banks. CICLs rating also factors the insurers access to a sizable potential customer base within the co-operative movement and the access to potential customers from using the service centres owned by the co-operative societies. In 2017, almost one-third of the insurers policyholders were from the co-operative movement.
Fitch sees CICLs capitalisation as good. The insurers capitalisation, as measured by its risk-based capital (RBC) ratio, was 183% at end-June 2018 (2017: 180%; 2016: 139%) against the 120% regulatory minimum. However, we expect capitalisation to remain constrained around this level over the medium term because of the insurers expansion plans, occasional appetite for high-risk investments as well as a possible infusion of capital to its life subsidiary, Cooplife Insurance Limited (Cooplife) should the need arise.

A futile finale
It is fitting that the Joint Opposition protest rally in Colombo on Wednesday culminated in a Thovil ceremony of sorts, since it amply gave expression to the pithy Sinhala saying natapu thoilekuth ne beray paluwakuth ne. There was no takeover of the government, come dawn, the next day, as vowed by some JO MPs. Come to that, there was no nocturnal vigil either by the protesters preceding such a take over. Also, there was no surrounding of the Capital city (api kolomba vatalanawa) as claimed by Wimal Weerawansa, nor did the protesters number one million, as predicted by Dullas Alahepperuma. Far from it there were hardly 50,000 protestors, which was visually magnified by TV cameras, aided by the confined space of the Lake House roundabout, which was eventually chosen for the final gathering.
On top of that, the slogans that were on display did not match the stated objective of the protest, one such placard calling for the restoration of media freedom, decidedly incongruous with the determined bid of the protest leaders to send the Government home by early morning. It all boiled down to just one thing - showcasing Namal Rajapaksa as the next face in the Rajapaksa lineup to assume the country's leadership.
But at what cost Lotus Road and its environs that contain the heart of Colombo's commercial centre was laid siege upon, the protesters blocking all access roads, forcing businesses to close shop and employers in the State and Mercantile sector to dispatch their staff home early. Fuel waste caused by the long lines of vehicles struck in the traffic-jams no doubt was another loss to the economy. In addition, like the recent railway strike, many of the office workers and schoolchildren certainly would have been caught up in the blockade and forced to spend the night on the streets, for when the do was over, it was well past midnight when no public transport plied. Like Minister Thalatha Athukorale was to opine, the Rajapaksas who ruined the economy by accumulating astronomic debt, while in power, were now inflicting further damage to the economy, while out of power, by staging shows to retain power within the family.
Which again brings to the fore the question of demarcating special venues for demonstrations in the Colombo city. Like we advocated in these columns yesterday, the government should seriously consider revisiting its earlier suggestion to reserve locations that are cut-off from the mainstream traffic in the city, for agitations of this nature. If necessary, laws should be introduced to facilitate this. In such an event there would not arise the need for the police to obtain court orders to prevent protestors from converging on places which are the economic hubs and that which would inconvenience the public.
The police failed in its bid to obtain a court order on this occasion, with the Magistrate refusing to issue one and instead requesting the law enforcement to act if there was a breach of the peace. The police, to its credit, acted with great restraint, not falling for the wiles of the organisers to instigate a police firing, in order to have a handy dead-body to parade forth.
Be that as it may, there was much gloating about the crowd attendance at Wednesdays do by JO speakers. For S.B. Dissanayake, although the Galle Face crowd at the Pohottuwa May Day was nothing to write home about, Wednesday's throng, confined to Lake House roundabout, happened to be the largest that ever assembled in the Colombo city. According to Bandula Gunawardane, who addressed the crowd from a make-shift stage, Wednesday was a historical day (ithihasagatha dinayak) where they were able to surround the entire Colombo city (api mulu kolombama vatakaralai thiyenne). This by an individual who claimed that a family of three could subsist on Rs. 2,500/- a month, when he was the country's Education Minister, no less.
The crowds that were seen at the JO's do on Wednesday were those who were bussed- in from all parts of the country. There are over 140 electorates, not counting the North and East, and, like on May Day, political party leaders in charge of these electorates are tasked with bringing as many supporters as they could muster to the meeting venues. As an incentive the supporters are supplied with free liquor and the inevitable buth (lunch) packet. There are many willing villagers who are ready to jump at the chance of visiting Colombo, together with the jetsam and flotsam sans any occupation. Thus, with supporters brought in from all the 140 electorates in the country the final tally tends to get magnified in the end. What was seen on Wednesday at the Lake House roundabout was such a phenomenon. If crowds were to be the barometer to gauge the popularity of a political party, Rohana Wijeweera would have been the President of this country even before JRJ.
Obviously massive financial resources had been liberally thrown into anoint Namal Rajapaksa as the next heir to the throne within the Rajapaksa clan. There can be no second guessing as to how and when such a war chest had been amassed.

Searching for loopholes in the 19th Amendment:
Gambling on ambiguities
The 19th Amendment passed by the Parliament of Sri Lanka in 2015 has become the talking point in the country. The main reason for this is the manner in which Article 4.2 of the said amendment has been interpreted by the so-called legal luminaries supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa.
According to them, the Article 4.2 of the amendment, which clearly states that no person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the people, shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people is not applicable to Mahinda Rajapaksa. They make this claim on the basis that this does not apply to former presidents but only to the Presidents who was or will be elected after the amendment was passed. The Rajapaksa supporters, therefore, state that the former President can contest for the Presidency again without a legal hindrance or barrier.
When one looks at the argument made by the Rajapaksa supporters, it becomes clear that they make it on the basis of promoting one individual in the hope of regaining power. Further, their whole analysis purely revolves around Mahinda Rajapaksa and nothing else. Hence, a pertinent question one must ask here is whether the Constitution and its legal provisions can be or should be interpreted to promote and satiate one person (or the Rajapaksa supporters) political ambitions.
When we analyse this situation, it becomes evident that it is a political fraud exercise to interpret the Constitution by looking at the 19th Amendment alone by personalising it to Mahinda Rajapaksa. From a political point of view, the 19th Amendment should not be looked at or analysed in such a vacuum but should be analysed in line with the constitutional and political developments which led to it. Hence, the legal framework of the Constitution of 1978, the 17th Amendment to the Constitution made in 2001, the 18th Amendment to the Constitution done in 2015 should all be analysed when trying to understand the context in which the 19th Amendment to the Constitution was brought about.
Democratic governance
Constitutionalism i.e. the governance of the state according to the legal provisions set forth by the Constitution is an important condition for democratic governance. Governance without a Constitution obviously falls into the realm of autocracy or an autocratic rule. But having a Constitution merely does not make a state democratic as it can be easily formulated in a manner to function autocratically under the guise of democracy. Such constitutions become juxtapositions to both democratic governance and constitutionalism and the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka is a prime example of such.
The Constitution of 1978 established a presidential system of governance within Sri Lanka and the creator of that constitution, J R Jayewardene introduced this system by stating that it would promote political stability and accelerate economic development of the state. Jayewardene believed that a politically stable government can be brought forth only by establishing a powerful and strong executive.
He then created the worlds most powerful executive presidency and used incorporated several constitutional decorations mirroring checks to cover up the undemocratic authoritativeness of it. Some such notable elements brought forth to make it rhetorically democratic were the ability given to the people to elect the President every six years, limiting the ability of a person to hold the office only twice, making the President responsible for the execution of his duties to the parliament and if the President is guilty of a wrongdoing, giving the parliament the power to impeach him/her. But in practice, several years after its establishment, it became quite clear that the Executive Presidency of this country is an absolute authoritarian and autocratic system built upon the guise of democracy.
In addition to this, it became evident that the state was moving towards a dangerous autocratic form of rule and that the principles of accelerating economic growth and providing political stability were mere rhetoric used to gain political leverage in justifying the establishment of such a dangerous system.
Two major reasons paved the way for this. One reason was that the systems established to check the powers of the executive were not powerful enough in reality to check the vast executive, legislative and judicial powers enjoyed by the President. Thus, they were pragmatically and practically ineffective. Especially, the notion that the President is responsible to the parliament and that h/she can be removed from an impeachment is absolute a constitutional decoration with no real practical application or value.
Executive powers
The only effective ones out of the checks imposed on the President were the clauses which restricted the term to two times and the ability of the people to elect the President every six years. Leaving these aside, the President was kept about the rule of law and was not under it thereby giving the executive more space to function autocratically.
Thus, the 19th Amendment then is a culmination in the rise of the democratic forces against this autocratic model which functioned under the guise of democracy. But the struggle for democratising this started 17 years before in 2001 with the 17th Amendment to the Constitution. The main purpose of the 17th Amendment was to remove the power granted by the Constitution to the President which allowed him/her to make appointments to high government posts on personal preference.
The 17th Amendment to the Constitution established a Constitutional Council and the members of the Police Commission, Elections Commission, Public Service Commission, Human Rights Commission, the Commission to Investigate Bribery and Corruption and the Delimitation Commission could only be appointed on the recommendation of the said Constitutional Council. In addition, the President could appoint the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court and other judges, the president of the Court of Appeal and other judges, members of the Judicial Service Commission, the Attorney General, Auditor General, Inspector General of the Police, the Ombudsman and the Secretary General of the Parliament only after the recommendation of the Constitutional Council.
17th Amendment
The 17th Amendment to the Constitution gave wider powers to the Public Service Commission and the Judicial Service Commission whilst establishing two new commissions in relation to elections and the police service. Hence, the 17th Amendment laid the foundation to curb and curtail the authoritativeness of the executive president, therefore, making it a bit more democratic.
The 18th Amendment to the Constitution was brought forth by the then President Mahinda Rajapaksa with the support of his cahoots and henchmen. It was passed on September 8, 2010, where 161 members of the parliament voted in favour of it while 17 voted against it. Forty-six members were absent and hence, the amendment was passed in the parliament with a two thirds majority. President Rajapaksa, by bringing forth the 18th Amendment to the Constitution, managed to absolutely overturn the steps taken by the 17th Amendment in making the executive president more democratic and made the office of the President into an absolute autocracy again.
The 18th Amendment brought about three major changes to the constitution. Firstly, the restriction on the number of times one can be elected as the President was taken out and provisions were brought forth to allow a person to contest for the Presidency for any amount of time.
Independent commissions
Secondly, the independent Constitutional Council was abolished and a Parliamentary Council which could be directly controlled according to the whims and fancies of the President was established.
This again gave the president the absolute power to appoint people to high positions in the government service on his/her personal preference.
Thirdly and finally, the 18th Amendment drastically reduced the powers of all the independent commissions thus destroying the original intent on which they were established. By enacting such changes, Mahinda Rajapaksa made the already autocratic model into one mirroring an autocratic monarchical model thereby destroying all the notions of democratic governance.
The 19th Amendment to the Constitution made in 2015 was solely brought forth to bring back the office of the executive president under the auspice of democratic principles and reverse the damage done to democracy by the Rajapaksa regime.
The amendment brought back the clause stating that a person can be elected into the office of the president only twice.
It then reduced the tenure of the President from six years to five and stated that a person has to be 35 years of age or above that to contest for the Presidential election. It reestablished the Constitutional Council and revitalized the independent commissions and further reduced the absolute power the president had in relation to the parliament and the Cabinet of ministers. It becomes clear when we look at the 19th Amendment that its sole purpose was to curtail an autocratic ruler like former President Mahinda Rajapaksa from coming to power again within this state.
Today, the Rajapaksa cahoots and henchmen are trying their best to bring back Mahinda Rajapaksa into power again and reverse the democratic achievements and rule brought forth by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena.
Rajapaksa supporters
Their sole hope is to go back to a feudal type of autocratic monarchical rule which is far detached from modern democratic principles of governance.
Hence, this is why they are trying their level best to interpret the 19th Amendment in such a manner and promote that fraud notion among the masses.
If the Rajapaksa supporters are real admirers and followers of democracy as they preach on a daily basis, what they should do is to interpret the 19th Amendment made to the Constitution by placing it in this wider socio-political context and not look for loopholes and interpret it in a wrong manner. Therefore, whoever looks for loopholes in the 19th Amendment is an archenemy of democracy and an absolute enemy of the open society.

Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne promised to resolve the problems confronted by gem and jewellery exporters after making representations to President Maithripala Sirisena about them shortly.
The Minister gave this assurance at a meeting held with a delegation of the Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association at his Ministry recently. The delegates pointed out that the withdrawal of the tax concession of profits earned by gem and jewellery exports and the 0.5 service charge imposed by the National Gem and Jewellery Authority were serious impediments for their industry. They pointed out that the withdrawal of the tax concession resulted in the loss of nearly US$ 500 million annually.
The delegates also pointed out that increase of customs duty on gold imports had adversely affected the jewellery industry. The Minister told the delegates that he would brief the President about the problems raised and try to obtain some remedial action.

Global trade storm unlikely to change  Asias positive consumer market
Consumer spending in Asia, with a big push from China, is an increasingly important economic driver for the region.
But with the global trade environment fragile and U.S.-China tariff conflict escalating, it remains a question whether the momentum can continue. The answer, according to some strategists, investors and analysts, is largely that it will  though there are potential bumps in the road.
The outlook for consumer spending in Asia, a region which accounts for 60 percent of the worlds population, remains bright overall, according to a report issued Monday by Daiwa Capital Markets in Hong Kong. Optimism is buoyed by factors such as an overall relatively young and growing population, an expanding middle class and increasing wealth.
Consumption will likely be a dominant economic theme in Asia in the next few decades, underlined by population expansion and rising private incomes, wrote the reports lead author, Paul M. Kitney, Daiwas chief equity strategist for Asia-Pacific research.
Possible setbacks caused by renewed protectionist sentiment and global liquidity tightening in the near term are unlikely to derail the uptrend in Asian consumption, in our view, the report said. Karine Hirn, partner at asset manager East Capital in Hong Kong, also said that Asia remains an attractive consumer proposition given positives such as demographics and increasing purchasing power. Hirn added that it is important to remember that even though tariffs can impact consumer prices and inflation, trade itself will continue and Asian consumer spending is likely to avoid major disruption.
Policy action Asia, in general, is quite immune to any major pain from the ongoing tariff battles, she told CNBC on Wednesday. Daiwa noted that trade risks could have some negative impact, especially if global supply chains, in which Asia plays a key role, take a significant hit.
This could in turn dampen individual income growth and dent consumer confidence, leading to reduced private spending, it said.
Consumer spending in Asia has also been boosted in recent years by a world awash in liquidity in the decade following the global financial crisis. Central banks, led by the U.S. Federal Reserve, turned on the taps after credit seized up following the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers 10 years ago this month. (WWW. CNBC.com) Daiwa said that despite some marginal tightening in Asia in the wake of Fed rate rises in recent years, the overall monetary policy environment remains loose. CNBC News

Implementation  of National  Export  Strategy  begins
The strategy identifies three main approaches to making the EEC sector successful in the next five years. These are to leverage existing capacity of being an Electronic Manufacturing Services Centre, become a component manufacturing base for large multinational brands and to leverage innovative ideas available in academia and the industry
The National Export Strategy (NES) has started sailing in the high waves after obtaining Cabinet approval and the launch with all the stakeholders of NES.
The National Export Strategy (NES), a flagship development project spearheaded by the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade and the Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) together with the public private partnership commenced its implementation. The Navigator, State Minister for International Trade and the Core Team comprising senior public and private sector representatives who were leading the designing and formulation of the NES gathered at the MoDSIT to track and plan the future implementation of NES.
Some quick wins which could thrive in exports and grow at the targeted rates were extracted from the NES plan of actions in consultation with Advisory Committees are currently being implemented through the Budget Proposals. To name a few; the Export Market Access Support Scheme; Establishment of ICT Initiative program. In addition, the electronic industry is working closely with EDB and BOI to attract new investors who are already established in the global network to be engaged with local partners through joint ventures with Sri Lankan electronic exporters and manufacturers. Furthermore, EDB together with the Ministry, BOI and other relevant government institutions and industry is heavily occupied in establishing a dedicated industry zone for boat building, to establish infrastructure facilities for the boat building industry in the Koggala Industrial Zone and Weligama and also development of a regulatory framework for the boat building industry. In addition, the establishment of a Trade Promotional Platform is also being finalized.
The Advisory Committees have already commenced to implement identified focused actions under each sector. These Advisory Committees facilitate actively in the implementation of the NES by closely monitoring Plan of Actions of the Sector Strategies.
The NES Management Unit is established to lead the co-ordination, follow up and monitoring of the NES and to work closely with the relevant Ministries, national agencies, industry associations, private sector organizations and development partners in enabling a smooth sail for NES implementation.
New Budget Proposals to be submitted to the National Budget 2019 were identified and extracted from NES. Hence, these new proposals were mainly focused on much needed safety and standards for processed food sector, that is: upgrading Food Safety Law and establishment of a Control Mechanism (Food Safety and Standard Authority), development of the Logistics sector and development of Sri Lanka Wellness Tourism sector. EDB also presented their Action Plan for the year 2019 which includes, in addition to NES focused sectors, National Quality Infrastructure, Trade Information and Promotion, Logistics sectors [u1] along with other mature sectors of Apparel, Tea, Rubber, Coconut and Gems and Jewellery.
Considering the Plan of Actions, the annual export targets and sectoral targets were further discussed which has been developed in consultation with exporters and the Central Bank Economic Research Department with the guidance of the Ministryof Development Strategies and International Trade to achieve US $ 28 billion by 2022. EDB also mentioned that these targets have been already shared among all relevant public and private sector stakeholders and highlighted the importance of their support in achieving them.
State Minister for International Trade instructed EDB to create awareness on NES among all stakeholders especially among the Government Officials, as an initiative, EDB got an opportunity to do a presentation on NES at a seminar organized by the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs which was chaired by the Prime Minister, with Secretaries of all Ministries.
The NES document is hailed by the think tanks as a bold far reaching and ambitious one. The stakeholders involved in the NES are confident that the targets are achievable as the formulation was done on a solid footing at a time the country has recorded an all-time high export turnover of US$ 15.2 bn. in 2017 (merchandize and services). NES focus sectors provide a good mix of industries with different growth trends, yet ensures the NES remains focused to achieve the key objective of export diversification during its five year implementation period. These focus sectors were identified based on quantitative and qualitative parameters derived from export potential assessments since the existing structure of the export of goods and services is already saturated. Hence it is a dream which can be achieved by the dedication and support from each and every institution to reach the high economic growth through exports.
On the selection of focus sectors were also discussed and the views expressed by some of the stakeholders are quoted below:
Wellness Tourism
Wellness Tourism is not narrowing down the tourism sector, but adds more value to general tourism industry. The Wellness Tourism (Health and Wellness Service) sector attracts wealthy foreigners from high spending markets such as UK, Germany, Austria, Switzerland and GCC. While the general tourism receives more backpackers.
The minimum stay of a medical traveller is one week including Ayurveda treatment which sometimes goes beyond three weeks depending on their illness as they are visiting purposely knowing the value of this service.
As a country with highly skilled medical professionals in both indigenous and western medical sector, the country could easily be on par with other medical tourism destinations if we could address the policy and regulatory reforms.
Electronics
The Electrical and Electronic Components (EEC) sector as a visionary sector for growth and development for the next five years has seen a steady growth in Asia. This will lead Sri Lanka towards its aspirations to become a hub of growth and innovation in the Asian region, and thereby providing employment and prosperity to millions of Sri Lankans.
Globally, the electronics industry has grown from USD 1.75 trillion in 2008 to USD 2.1 trillion in 2016. It is estimated further grow to USD 2.4 trillion by 2020. Despite the significant growth of the sector internationally, Sri Lanka has had limited participation in the sector so far. The NES will take into account Sri Lankas skilled labour, infrastructure and preferential access to key destination markets (such as GSP+) to further develop its EEC industry.
The recommendations of the NES are a combined efforts of public and private sector stakeholders to optimize strength, overcome constraints and move towards establishing the Sri Lankan Electrical and Electronic Component sector as an integral manufacturing and trading hub of the Asian region.
The essential strategy is also to produce only selected components and join the global production networks, since this strategy was followed by countries in East Asia, such as Malaysia, Thailand and the Philippines, when they penetrated the global high tech markets.
The strategy identifies three main approaches to making the EEC sector successful in the next five years. These are to leverage existing capacity of being an Electronic Manufacturing Services Centre, become a component manufacturing base for large multinational brands and to leverage innovative ideas available in academia and the industry.
Processed food and beverages
The NES prioritises the food industry in context of the very formidable social and economic opportunity that Sri Lanka has for transformation of this sector.
Lack of innovation and value addition and inadequate branding are all constraints that plague the sector which are addressed in a systematic manner in the NES.
The National Quality Council and National Food Authority are two core elements of the NES in relation to food and their purpose is significantly to create an enabling environment for Small and Medium Enterprise to understand and adapt to the requirements for branding, value addition and export of Sri Lankan produce.
There are perceived disadvantages linked to weak productivity in Sri Lanka which the NES frames within the potential for the same factors to become clear advantages on account of changing consumer preferences. Food safety fears, social and lifestyle factors have created a situation where small scale, artisanal produce is valued over its large, commodity scale equivalent, especially where there are wellness benefits.
The evolving characteristics of the international market and associated opportunities make the prioritisation of the Sri Lankan food and beverage processing sector an important element in the NES.

Irrigation project to help  wealth flow to farmers
Living standards in mountainous counties in Northwest China are set to rise as a result of infrastructure improvements. Yao Yuxin reports from Jainca county, Qinghai.
Like most people in the area round the Yellow River Valley in Qinghai province, Jamyang Gyatso, a 56-year-old farmer from the Tibetan ethnic group, lets his fields lie fallow for seven months of the year.
With only 300 to 400 millimeters of rainfall annually and evaporation exceeding 1,300 mm, local farmers have long battled an acute water shortage.
Although the Yellow River flows through the region, its level is well below that of the surrounding farmland so the locals use electric pumps to raise the water they need for drinking and irrigation.
The cost of powering the pumps on Gyatsos 4,000 square meters of farmland is about 900 yuan ($132) a year - a significant amount given that his annual income from farming is about 6,000 yuan before the cost of fertilizers, seeds and labor are deducted.
Thats just enough to feed us, he said, referring to his family of nine in Gabu, a village in Jainca county. The familys main income comes from Gyatsos three sons, who work in a nearby town, and the fungi he and other members of the family collect to sell. However, the lack of water and the old, small-scale pumping stations will soon be history because they will be replaced by a more efficient irrigation system which is currently under construction.
The new system - called the Qinghai Rural Water Management Project - will use water from two reservoirs in the surrounding mountains, so conduits are being built that will allow gravity to carry it to the farmland.
The project was approved by the provincial government in 2006 and work started five years later to build irrigation channels in three counties in the Yellow River Valley - the Hualong Hui, Jainca and Xunhua Salar autonomous counties.
The work is due to be completed on Sept 30, having received total investment of about 1.58 billion yuan.
Inadequate supply
Li Zhihong, an agricultural expert on the project, said the lack of water means the land is little better than a desert.
A field of wheat usually needs to be watered five to seven times before it is fully ripe, but the water shortage in the valley means farmers usually irrigate their crops just twice during the growing season, resulting in low yields.
In addition, the lack of water can lead to conflict among farmers. The high strain on water resources means Gabu is allocated just three hours of water five to seven times a year, which is barely enough to irrigate the 667 sq m of farmland in the village (equal to the traditional Chinese measurement of 1 mu, which is used in the region), according to Ji Jincai, who has been head of Gabu for the past four years.

JO protest a damp squib - Sagala
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the ;Jana Balaya protest by the Joint Opposition (JO) in Colombo yesterday ended up as a damp squib.
The JO dug its political grave by launching this disastrous protest, Ratnayaka said in a statement issued this afternoon.
Full statement:
The protest campaign, organised by the Joint Opposition and the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) in Colombo yesterday ended up as a farce and a damp squib.
Initially, there were reports that they planned to lay siege to the commercial capital of the country and then they talked about protesting overnight and toppling the government.
In the end, however, they could not continue their protest at least until midnight and many protestors went back to their villages blaming the organisers for lack of coordination and planning. So a protest that was aimed at toppling the government finally boomeranged on its organisers, much to the disappointment of the Rajapaksa cabal. This is one of the biggest setbacks suffered by the Rajapaksa group in the recent past, and the leaders of the protest became a laughing stock in the eyes of the entire country.
The Rajapaksa cabal first started their meandering by holding a rally in Nugegoda months after the downfall of the previous government. Then they moved to Kirulapona, Kandy, Galle Face and several other locations. They described each of these events as the first salvo to topple the government. Although several first salvos have been fired so far, nothing has happened to the national unity government or its leaders and they continue to steer the country in the right direction. The firers of these first salvos are still in the opposition, without any prospects of forming a government in the future.
It is important to understand the reason behind initiating a protest of this nature at this juncture. It all started when Parliament passed legislation to set up a Special High Court to hear cases of bribery and corruption. Over the first three years of the government, investigations into financial crimes and corruption progressed slowly as the investigators had to overcome many technical and practical difficulties. We repeatedly stated that they would soon overcome those challenges and the perpetrators of financial crimes and corruption would be brought to book. Now the majority of these investigations have reached their final stages and a special court has been set up to expedite the judicial process.
This, needless to say, is a major concern for the Rajapaksa cabal as they know the wheels of justice are moving. Their collective conscience is aware that they cannot play hike-and-seek with the law enforcement anymore. So, their last resort was a massive protest campaign to show the world that they were being hunted down for political reasons. It was in this context that the Janabalaya campaign was planned by a group affiliated with Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa.
However, little did they realize that they were too late of this sort of tamashas. The public is familiar with their theatrics and cannot be hoodwinked anymore. It is now clear that the Rajapaksas have only hoodwinked themselves by these disastrous tactics.
Despite their claims of toppling the government, some of their supporters were seen stranded in the city, without being able to go back home after the protest. It was also revealed that 81 drunk protesters, who were knocked out on the street, were picked up by the Suwaseriya Ambulance service and admitted to hospital. When all this unfolded, the leaders of the Joint Opposition were wining and dining in their plush suites, in some leading hotels, not too far away from the Lake House roundabout.
None of them were apologetic about the great inconvenience they caused to office workers trying to go back to their loved ones after a long day of work. They were the ones who were relentlessly exploited by a family rule for nearly a decade. In a way, it is naive to expect them to be considerate about the common public, when they do not want to look into the needs of those who marched to Colombo in support of their political campaign.
The biggest outcome of the Janabalaya campaign, in my view, is that it unmasked the top echelons of the Joint Opposition and exposed their real faces to the public. At the same, it reminded the Rajapaksa cabal that street protests or other forms of theatrics cannot save them from the long arm of the law.

JO protest a flop; two dead, 16 injured
The Jana Balaya Kolambata protest campaign organised by the Joint Opposition (JO) had failed to get the desired outcome and turned out to be a flop while one person had died and 16 people were admitted to the Colombo National Hospital.
One person who had died on admission to the Colombo National Hospital is said to have suffered a heart attack.
Another person died in an accident in Nittambuwa.He has got down from the bus to buy pineapples on his return from the Joint Opposition protest. He was knocked down by a vehicle while crossing the road and died on admission to hospital.
Eight people were admitted due to food poisoning while another eight persons were admitted due to minor injuries, hospital sources said.
Several government ministers termed the JO protest rally as a huge failure.
Although the protest rally was expected to continue until yesterday morning, it ended by midnight on Wednesday.
The Joint Opposition termed the demonstration as one that would topple the government, they did not receive the anticipated crowds. Hence, Mahinda Rajapaksa and the JO came under ridicule and mocking over social media. Meanwhile, the Colombo streets were in a state of disarray with piles of garbage including empty lunch boxes and plastic bottles littering the streets which the protest was held. However, the CMC had to deploy additional workers in order to clean up the streets after the protest ended.
Speaking to the Daily News Municipal Commissioner V.K.A. Anura said that workers generally used over three days had to be deployed to clean up the streets after the protest.
The streets were littered and we had to deploy additional staff and vehicles in order to clean up the mess that was created. This process required additional expenditure. Even with the additional manpower and vehicles it took us until around 12.00 pm on Thursday to complete the cleaning process.
In addition, the Municipal Commissioner noted that the protestors had damaged the taps and doors of public toilets and at the Vihara Maha Devi Park during the protest. However, he said that an estimate of the damage caused had not been done yet.

Joint Opposition calls for General Election now
The Joint Opposition challenged the Government for a General Election if they claim Wednesday's protest to be unsuccessful.
The Janabalaya Kolambata protest was the most successful protest campaign ever in the political history of Sri Lanka, MP Namal Rajapaksa said yesterday.
Addressing a news briefing organised by the Joint Opposition at the SLPP office in Battaramulla yesterday, Rajapaksa said they were able to accomplish the task more than they expected amid Governments moves to sabotage the protest and prevent it from taking place. He said that the Government still says that the protest was a failure. We cant fathom as to why they say so after having witnessed the mounting displeasure from thousands of people gathered in the protest, Namal said.

Lalith, Anusha appeal petitions to be heard on October 10
Two appeal petitions filed by former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court, were yesterday fixed for October 10 by the Court of Appeal.
Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita had been sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
When the two appeal petitions came up before the Court of Appeal, Justice Deepali Wijesundara and Justice Achala Wengappuli, the parties were directed to file their written submissions before October 5.
On September 7 last year, Lalith Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC over the controversial sil redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Through their appeal applications, the two accused-appellants stated that they were seeking the jurisdiction of the Court of Appeal to review and set aside their conviction imposed by the High Court dated September 7, 2018.
In their petitions, the accused-appellants stated that neither Rs. 600 million nor a part of it were used by them for their personal gains. They further stated that the High Court Judge had given them a short period (13 days) to pay off the compensation.
While handing out a lengthy judgement, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had maintained that the prosecutors had proven the accused guilty beyond a reasonable doubt.
The High Court Judge further maintained that the accused had committed this offence dishonestly with the intention of gaining undue advantage to a particular candidate during the 2015- Presidential Election.
While observing that a political motivation had led the accused to commit this offence, Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita were ordered to pay a compensation of Rs. 50 million each to the TRC in lieu of losses incurred contrary to the Telecommunication Act.
Each accused were further ordered to pay a fine of Rs. 2 million and in default of the payment of the fine, they will have to serve an additional one year's imprisonment.

Lanka in must win game against Maldives
Sri Lanka will be facing a must win game against Maldives in the South Asian Football Championship at Banghabandhu Stadium in Bangladesh today.
In Group B Sri Lanka competing along with India and Maldives lost to India 2-0. India tops the table with three points.
It will be interesting to see how both Sri Lanka and Maldives would prepare to neutralise the potent counter-attacking style of football they display in their must win match.
Were going to play against Maldives, obviously, it will be quite difficult, but it is up to us to fight. We didnt play well in the first game against India. This match is more important to us to climb the table to secure a semi-final spot. said Nizam Pakeer Ali.
He further said that Sri Lanka didnt play as he expected against India. Most of the Indian team are professional footballers, we have played with a combination of junior and senior players. We hope to make an impact against Maldives.
India dominated proceedings in midfield, ensuring Sri Lanka was denied of ball. A pragmatic Packeer Ali acknowledged his opponents quality, while highlighting the areas he would work on with the Sri Lanka team, to get the three points against Maldives.
India is a tough team, we have to accept the truth. We could have lost 1-0 but we made a lot of mistakes. We hope to do better the next time. Our midfield didnt function very well, and I will be focusing mainly on rectifying that for the coming games, Packeer Ali said.
Meanwhile Nepal defeated Bhutan by 4-0 in a Group A fixture worked off yesterday after leading 1-0 at half time.

No cameras please! one thing Meghan Markle and Prince Harry dont like about being royal
MEGHAN MARKLE is adapting to royal life seamlessly, graciously appearing at public events all over the country and impeccably representing the Royal Family. But Meghan just revealed the one thing she doesnt like about being royal.
Meghan Markle, 37, seems to be perfect for royal life, having her fair share of fame and publicity even before marrying Prince Harry.
She has slotted seamlessly into a life of glamorous events, global travelling, glittering jewellery and one of the most enviable wardrobes in the world.
However, it seems there is one thing that Meghan isnt quite liking about her new like as the Duchess of Sussex.
At the WellChild awards last night, Meghan let slip that she doesnt like the cameras being around her. Meghan and Harry spent the night talking to recipients of the awards, including four-year-old Mckenzie Brackley.
The little boy, who won an Inspirational Child award for strength following his battle with acute flaccid paralysis, told the Duke and Duchess that he didnt like the cameras being around.
Meghan and Harry, who are used to being surrounded by cameras, then told Mckenzie that they completely agreed.
Talking to reporters on the night, Mckenzies mother Amy said: "They were so lovely. They knew [Mckenzie] was scared of the cameras and they said they didnt like the cameras either so they turned around.
It is known that Meghan and Harry havent had the easiest of times when it comes to cameras and publicity. Harry reportedly has tried to scale back public appearances in recent weeks, to try and tone down and control the media frenzy around his wife.
The couple also had issues with the media and cameras at the start of their relationship, so much so that Kensington Palace had to issue a formal statement.
The statement addressed the harassment and abuse that Meghan had faced by certain publications, writing that Harry has "never been comfortable" with the "significant curiosity about his private life.
The letter, which addressed the formal action the Royal Family had had to taken in order to protect their private life and said the media had taken their coverage of Meghan a step too far.
However, it seems the couple do appreciate the power of the media in other ways, with the statement also addressing how the media can raise awareness of "the issues he cares about".
Despite the clicking and flashing cameras at the WellChild event, Meghan still managed to look calm and collected, dressed to the nines in a stylish black power suit.

OMP wants Enforced  Disappearance Act amended
The Office on Missing Persons (OMP) has recommended amending the Enforced Disappearances Act to expressly recognise the full scope of command responsibility, including the ordering of enforced disappearances.
The OMP, in its first interim report submitted to the President on Thursday, has also recommended the Government to publish a full list of all detention centres as well as detainees, and ensure that persons are not detained in any unauthorised detention centre.
The OMP in its report has also undertaken the task of creating a list of the missing and the disappeared. At present there is no single accepted statistic for the total number of the missing and the disappeared in Sri Lanka. The Office thus will take on the critical role of compiling these records and developing a centralised list for its work and the interventions of other agencies and institutions, it added.
It recommends investigating all incidents of arbitrary arrest, torture and deaths in custody.
The OMP proposes the implementation of a financial aid programme to provide a monthly living allowance of Rs. 6,000 to the surviving spouse, children and/or surviving parents of a missing or disappeared person, who have no permanent income.
The current socio-economic situation of many families of the missing and the disappeared is dire and cannot wait until a final reparation scheme is devised, the report observed. As interim relief measures, the OMP proposes a debt-relief programme, Housing development programme, Educational support programme and Vocational training and livelihood development programmes to the family members of the missing/disappeared. It proposes to introduce an employment quota of 1 percent to family members of the missing/disappeared when vacancies in the public and semi-governmental sectors are filled.
The OMP is of the view that the criminalisation of enforced disappearances under domestic law remains inadequate. It recommends further amendments to the Enforced Disappearances Act to expressly recognise enforced disappearances as a crime against humanity. It requests to repeal and reform provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act which permit prolonged detention of individuals without judicial review.
Some individuals suspected of having committed enforced disappearances and related offences are being permitted to remain in positions of powerespecially within the armed forces and the policewhere they can influence the progress of an investigation. There have been instances where members of the armed forces, who were willing to provide information on disappearances, were subject to harassment. OMP notes that under relevant regulations as well as the rules and established practices it is reasonably expected for such suspected officers to be suspended from exercising the duties and functions of their office, the report states.
The OMP is of the view that in habeas corpus applications the Attorney Generals Department should not represent the interests of persons who are alleged to be perpetrators but rather should represent the interests of the state in a manner that would respect, secure and advance the fundamental rights of the people, it added.
It also recommends designating a National Day for the Disappeared. Further it recommends preserving mass grave sites as memorial spaces after excavations and restoring Ahinsakaramaya Memorial for the Innocents-in Battaramulla.

The business of Parliament for yesterday and many committee meetings scheduled parallel to the sittings were postponed due to sudden adjournment of the House. The quorum of members was requested by UPFA MP Bandula Gunawardena after the presentations of papers and public petitions.
Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri, who was at the Chair, ordered to ring the quorum bell to summon the members in, but only 17 MPs remained after the quorum bell rang for five minutes. Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella at this point requested the consent of the House to proceed without considering the lack of quorum of MPs. It is a waste of money and time. I request to continue despite the lack of quorum of MPs, he said.
The Deputy Speaker said he could not allow that request as it is a violation of the Standing Orders of Parliament. Then he announced that the sittings were adjourned till 10 am today.
The House could not even take up the oral question round at the commencement of the sittings, and the second reading of Economic Service Charge (Amendment) Bill and Regulation under the Value Added Tax (Amendment) Act scheduled for yesterday had to be postponed.
MPs Bandula Gunawardena and S. C. Muthukumarana were present in the chamber from the JO. Government members Gayantha Karunathilake, Lakshman Kiriella, Karunarathna Paranavithana, Ranjith Aluvihare, Shiyani Wijewickrema and Ananda Aluthgamage were present in the chamber while Eran Wickramaratne and Mayantha Dissanayake rushed in at the last minute of the quorum bell.

JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti and TNA MP Ganamuthu Srineshan entered the chamber after the sittings were adjourned. Some of these MPs had been attending various meetings including the COPE in the committee rooms in Parliament. Many UNP MPs were taking part in the UNP Anniversary Convention in Sirikotha yesterday morning.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had previously stated that Parliament spends over Rs 4.5 million each day to conduct the sittings.

Pet economy booming with high-end trend
Shanghai cat owner Xiao Wanqing packed her 28-inch suitcase full of imported cat food and toys at an international pet fair held in Shanghai, and ordered a courier to deliver it to her home.
The 21st Pet Fair Asia, receiving over 140,000 visitors over the weekend, closed on Sunday in Shanghai. Many like Xiao came, bringing big suitcases to buy global pet products.
Xiao tends to trust the quality of imported cat food, as big foreign pet food suppliers are more established and have good reputations, she said.
More than 1,300 exhibitors set up booths in the 140,000 square-meter exhibition hall.
My pet dog has a weak stomach, which food do you recommend asked Zhang Ran, a middle-age Shanghaier, at Royal Canins booth.
Based on the professional consultation offered by Li Xi, the companys vet, Zhang immediately ordered 6 kg of digestive dog food for her beloved Bichon Frise.
Zhang said when she got her dog eight years ago, she only knew of two different types of dog food, one for puppies and one for adult dogs. But now, there are more and more choices on the market, and she has to learn about the different types of food designed for different dog breeds.
Chinas pet food market has seen more and more products in recent years to cope with the rising demand of middle-class pet owners, said Li.
The company he works for has produced more than a dozen prescription dog foods for the China market, aiming to help dogs with illnesses like liver or intestinal problems.
As Chinese people pursue a more healthy and happy life, they are willing to treat their furry friends equally. Domestic pet food makers are catching up with the trend, said Zhao Haiming, general manager of Pure & Natural, a Chinese pet food brand.
Our market research finds pet owners in China are more and more well-informed regarding their pets health, and closely check the ingredients and nutritional elements before buying pet food, said Zhao. We are developing new products to catch up with consumers needs.
According to the Pet Industry White Paper 2018 published by goumin.com, a Chinese online pet forum, Chinese dog and cat owners are expected to spend over 5,000 yuan ($740) per pet in 2018, an increase of 15 percent from last year. Chinas dog and cat market has reached over 170 billion yuan.
Xiao said in addition to cat food, raising her pet has other expenses like grooming, vaccines, and medical treatment. The total spending for her cat is about 10,000 yuan a year.
American company Litter Robot brought an auto-cleaning litter box to the fair, which reduces the frequency of cleaning a litter box to once every few weeks.
The companys salesmen said more than 200 litter boxes are sold via Chinas e-commerce platforms each month, each costing over 5,000 yuan.
The World Cat Show recognized by the Cat Fanciers Association, a global organization for preserving pedigreed cats, was also held during the fair.
Qian Zheng, director of the cat zone of Pet Fair Asia, said over 200 pure-breed cats attended the show.
Qian is also a professional breeder of Persian cats.
She said nowadays, it is quite easy to contact professional breeders for consultations through social media. But 10 years ago, there were few. She bought her first Persian cat from a foreign breeder via e-mail.
At that time, no foreign breeder was willing to sell pure-bred kittens to a Chinese buyer. They didnt believe that we could treat cats with the right attitude and skills, and the rumors about Chinese eating cats certainly didnt help.
Qian said she tried hard to convince the breeder that there was no way she would spend thousands of dollars to buy a cat and not treat it with her best intentions.
Now as one of the most well-known cat breeders in the industry, Qians Persian cats have won first place in the Persian-bred cats category at the CFA cat show for two consecutive years.
Few Chinese pet owners attended the CFA cat show years ago. But now, new faces and new kittens from China appear every year, she said.
She said she owns 20 to 30 Persian cats now. These fluffy little angels cost her 600,000 to 700,000 yuan a year. According to research by China Agriculture University, the pet industry develops rapidly when a countrys GDP per capita is about $3,000 to $5,000. Chinas GDP per capita was about $8,800 last year.
As Asias largest trade show for animal supplies and aquariums, Pet Fair Asia started in Hong Kong and moved to Shanghai in 1999, a decision spurred by the growing demands of the market.
Since then, the scale of the fair has grown exponentially, from a 15,000 square-meter space in Shanghai Mart in 2003, to a whopping 140,000 square meters in Shanghai New International Expo Center this year.

Rugby flowed in his veins
The refrain 'Go Maiya, Go. Go Maiya, Go' still hums in my ears as I recall the rugby feats at the Bradby encounters of our 'SPORTS LEGEND' in the lyrics of the Royal College anthem  School of our Fathers composed by its Principal Major H.L. Reid in 1927 runs a line We will learn of books and men and learn to play the game.
True to those words and one who learnt of books and men and learnt to play the game, maintaining the lofty traditions not worried about the winning or losing as long as one played the game was Dr. INDRAJIT MAITHREE DE ZOYSA MAIYA GUNESEKERA, now a leading Consultant Surgeon who joins our proud galaxy of SPORTS LEGENDS this Friday.
GUNESEKERA as a junior at Royal College showed in addition to his brilliance in studies, also showcased tremendous talent in cricket, athletics and basketball. But the game that won his fancy and took him to the pinnacle of sport was rugby football.
Rugby mates at Royal
GUNESEKERA played for the Reid Avenue school in the company of Jagath Fernando, Fred Pereira, Janek Ranatunge, Ray de Silva and Wedanda and are some of the names he remembers.
GUNESEKERA and after excelling at rugby for school where he played in many famous Bradby Shield scrummages against Trinity College, he passed out to the University and with a lot of learning to do, continued his rugby career and as a side show excelled in athletics winning the 110 metres hurdles.
To GUNESEKERA in all sports he indulged in, the bottom line, like he jumped for the ball in the line outs and won the ball, was winning, not at all costs, but clean playing to the rules. His hard and clean play at rugby rubbed off on his school, club and Sri Lanka mates and most of his team mates I spoke to held nothing but kudos for him.
Chequered career at Royal
After a sparkling career at Royal College, he played rugby with gusto at the University and while still a medical student was the first to play rugby for the country in the 3rdand 4th Asian Games and Hong Kong sevens in 1972, 74 76 and 77.
Never before had a student at Medical College played for the country and crowning it all by obtaining classes in all Medical College examinations. He was also the Most Outstanding sportsman at the UNI winning the Leslie Handunge Trophy.
GUNESEKERA captained Royal, then the University rugby team in 1974 and CR & FC in 1978 and then the country. He considers as his most treasured and memorable moment the playing for Sri Lanka under the captaincy of that gentleman sportsman in INDRAJIT COOMARASWAMY, who we featured in these columns. That team attained the slot that Rugby in the country had not attained before--- being runners up to that Asia rugby powerhouse Japan in the 1974 Rugby Asiad held in Sri Lanka.
Highly principled
Looking for a sportsman of the calibre of GUNESEKERA is like searching for a needle in a haystack. He was highly principled in whatever endeavor he took to and he gave of his best and nothing but the best. He can be described as a man of many parts. Rugby being his craze and in an endeavor to see to the games progress and attain a feared status he took on the roles of Deputy President, President of the SLRFU, President of the Western Province RFU, National Selector, Chairman of Selectors, School Coach, National Coach, National Team Doctor, Team Physiotherapist, National Team Manager and was also Chef de Mission of the Sri Lanka squad for the 1998 Bangkok Asian Games  an unenviable record that will be hard to match.
At one time GUNESEKERA who was Chairman of Selectors threw in the towel on a matter of principle and Fair Play --not happy with the manner in which his son Thumith who was a promising player being treated by the school authorities and not given his rightful place in the school team.
Shocked rugby circles
Writing in his popular column SPORTSWATCH in the DAILY NEWS at that time DINESH WEERAWANSA said that the resignation of GUNESEKERA as Chairman of Selectors has shocked rugby circles just weeks away from Sri Lankas participation in the Singer-Sri Lanka Airlines IRB Sevens and Sri Lankas second round matches in the World Cup qualifiers.
Writing further WEERAWANSA stated: Informed sources said that Dr. GUNESEKERA, former Royal, CR & FC and SrI Lanka player, has resigned as Chairman of Selectors in disgust. Sources close to the reputed surgeon said that his decision to step down has been prompted as his only son has been at the receiving end where selections to his schools under-19 team was concerned.
Naturally he was very hurt as his son had all the credentials to be in the school team, which is going through a very poor season. They should have tried him out as the boy is good and should be given a fair chance as a prop forward and a place kicker.
President SLRFU 98/99
GUNESEKERA was President SLRFU in 1998/99, Vice President 1996/97. Was sevens national rugby coach in 1993/94. Coached Royal from 1992 to 95. He has also served as chairman of the National Sports Council for 7 years.
When he coached Royal for the first time in 1992 he had only 18 students attending practice. However undeterred he tuned them to beat the strong Thomian team that seemed invincible. He coached Royal to tie the Bradby Game against Trinity in 1992 and in 93 and 94 steered Royal to win the Bradby. GUNESEKERA also coached the national rugby sevens team for the Hong Kong sevens and in a closely contested game lost to Argentina 14-0 after holding the opponents to a scoreless first half. Lost to South Africa 28/14 after sharing the first half 14-all. Sri Lanka did well although losing to Kenya the kings of sevens rugby 33/29.
Rugby sevens is the game
GUNESEKERA is a firm believer that Sri Lankas fortunes in the game is in sevens rugby and according to him have the ideal players who could take the country to the pinnacle of sevens rugby. And GUNESEKERA knows what he is talking about.
Despite being a rugby fanatic he never neglected his studies. He is the holder of MBBS, FRCS (England), FRCS (ED), M S Surgeon SL, Fellow College of Surgery, Master of Surgery degree from the Post Graduate Institute of Medicine, FRCS (Ed and is now a Consultant Surgeon at Navaloka Hospitals.
Born on August 21, 1951
DR. GUNESEKERA was born on August 21, 1951. His parents were late Sena Gunesekera and late Mallika Gunesekera. His father was a DRO and did great service to the villages of Matugama and Minuwangoda. Gate Mudaliar L.M.W. Senanayake was his grandfather who was instrumental in building the Senanayake Aramaya. Dr. GUNESEKERA is married to Savithri Fernando and has three children  son Thumith, BSC-USA, daughters Dr.Ayainthi Gunesekera, Trainee Obstetrician, Royal Free Hospital, London and Sonalani Gunesekera a Lawyer in the UK.

Seven Reasons Why You Should Have A Pet
A pet can add joy and humor to your life.
Thinking about getting a pet Although a pet is an expense, and there is plenty of responsibility involved, there are many benefits of having one.
1. A pet can add humor to your life
It is funny to watch animals get so excited over things like eating table food or getting sprayed with water.
2. A pet can help reduce stress
Physical contact and touch with animals can lead to the body producing oxytocin, a hormone that reduces levels of the stress hormone cortisol.
If you find yourself feeling stressed out, having a pet comes in handy! Since animals like the attention, stroking an animal benefits both the owner and the pet, and it strengthens the bond between them.
3. You can sleep with your pet
Instead of sleeping alone, you would always have the option to let your pet sleep with you!
4. You can dress your pet
You can have fun dressing your pet in casual clothes and holiday outfits, such as Halloween costumes.
5. A pet will comfort you when you are feeling sad
Dogs and cats truly can sense when their owners are sad. It can be nice to know that your pet cares about you when you are feeling down. In those moments, you can count on your pet to be by your side.
6. A pet will give you responsibility
Having a pet is good for both kids and adults. It teaches kids responsibility which would help them later in life, and its beneficial for adults too since it helps them to be more responsible in other ways.
7. Your pet will always be excited to see you
If youve been away from home for a period of time, you can count on your pet to greet you when you make it home.

SL e-commerce to hit  US$ 400 mn by 2022
Sri Lankas e-commerce business sector is projected to hit US $ 400 million by 2022. The country has also swiftly moved one more step closer to formulating an e-commerce framework that would safeguard the countrys digital transactions locally and abroad.
According to industry experts, Sri Lankas annual domestic e-commerce sales value including services is around an estimated US $ 40 million (Sri Lanka Rs 6.4 billion). This can grow to US $400 million by 2022. The growing importance in retail sector in Sri Lankas GDP which has the potential to expand to ecommerce.
At present only 0.4% of Sri Lankas total annual retail sales (US $ 10 billion) is in e-commerce.
I thank the European Union Delegation to Sri Lanka for their continued support through the EU-Sri Lanka Trade-Related Assistance Project. We acknowledge the efforts by the ITC as the lead implementing agency and for their committed initiatives in leading this second Private Public Dialogue on Sri Lanka E-Commerce Reform, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch event of second Private Public Dialogue on Sri Lanka E-Commerce Reform in Colombo. It was organised jointly by the Consumer Affairs Authority under hum and International Trade Centre, Geneva.
This second PPD, part of the EU-Sri Lanka Trade Related Assistance project of Euro 8 million funded by the European Union (2016-2020), follows on the successful completion of first PPD of March 15-16, 2018 in Colombo, and seeks to wrap the draft recommendations made by visiting e-commerce expert from Genevas ITC Professor Michael Geist following the first PPD.
In this second dialogue CAA is working with all stakeholders to identify specific provisions where the current Sri Lanka legal framework falls short in these five themes so that updating national laws by formulating legislative proposals could follow thereafter. As a Government Regulatory Agency it is necessary for CAA to establish national policies for consumer protection that encourages good practices applicable also to e- commerce.
Sri Lankan consumer needs to be protected at pre purchase, purchase and post-purchase stages.
This can be done by establishing a good internet infrastructure for e-commerce, updating present legal frameworks on e-commerce, preventing misuse of consumer data, providing consumer education and enforcing relevant laws.
Visiting ITC Ecommerce expert and Prof Michael Geist (Full Professor-University of Ottawa and Canada Research Chair in Internet and E-commerce Law and who sits on the Board of CIRA (Canadian Internet Registration Authority) which manages Canadas .ca domains) said: Sri Lankas e-commerce value is smaller in comparison to the region and it represents a challenge and opportunity of its potential.
My report is designed to find a way forward for Sri Lanka e-commerce.
The five areas identified need further work in terms of legislative and programmatic aspects. Consumer protection laws & privacy is a foundational question laws on protection may be working for off-line transactions but not for e-commerce-how do you make them to work in a digital environment.
Date protection has become a strong need especially since March after passing the General Data Protection and Regulation in EU and as a result many around the world is paying closer attention to these rules and there is room for action in Sri Lanka on this too.

The Sri Lanka Navy - Indian Navy Joint exercise - SLINEX-2018 - will be held in Trincomalee from September 7-13.
The exercise which was previously held once in two years has been converted to an annual event from this year.
This signifies the desire of both countries to enhance cooperation in the maritime domain and to further strengthen mutual trust and interoperability between the two navies.
The exercise is a continuation of the ongoing operational interaction between both navies wherein regular ships visits are being undertaken between the two countries.
SLINEX 2017 was held at Visakhapatnam in September 2017, at which two SLNS ships participated.
The scope of the exercise has been significantly increased this year with three ships, two maritime patrol aircraft and one helicopter participating from the Indian side. In addition, Sri Lanka Air Force personnel would also join in the exercise for the first time.
The six-day exercise which will be conducted in two phases - the Harbour and the Sea Phase - will involve joint training, professional lectures, exchange of expertise, helicopter and maritime patrol aircraft operations, weapon drills, search and rescue, seamanship and manoeuvres at sea.
A highlight of the exercise would be the deployment, from China Bay, of Dornier aircraft manned by the Indian Navy, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Force to conduct maritime patrol exercises and to train personnel in conducting effective EEZ surveillance and rescue missions.
The exercise would also involve sports fixtures and cultural events which would provide an opportunity for personnel from both navies to learn from each other, reinforce shared values and build individual bonds of friendship.

Sri Lanka became a State Party to the CCM on March 1 and becomes the 103rd State Party to the Convention.
Sri Lankan Ambassador and Permanent Representative to the United Nations in Geneva, A.L. Abdul Azeez delivering a statement on the opening day of the 8MSP, said that Sri Lanka never used cluster munitions during its nearly three-decade long armed conflict between the government security forces and the LTTE.

Sri Lankas accession to the CCM requires that the country will not use, produce, transfer and stockpile cluster munitions. The CCM came into force in Sri Lanka on September 1.
The 8MSP enthusiastically supported Sri Lankas candidacy for Presidency of the ninth MSP next year and Sri Lankas Ambassador Azeez was designated as its President on September 5. This will be a historical occasion not only for Sri Lanka, but also for the South Asian region. Sri Lanka will be the first President of the CCM in the region.
The Sri Lankan government was also represented at this meeting by Major General H.R.K.P.

The event was held under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who graced the occasion as the chief guest. Minister of Plantation and Industries, Navin Dissanayake also attended as the guest of honour.
A large number of dignitaries and luminaries of the industry were present at the event, ushering new hopes for the revival of this perennial industry.
Sri Lanka is the fourth largest tea producer and third largest tea exporter in the world. However, a number of factors have caused the industry to become sluggish in the recent years. Adverse weather, unavailability of effective weedicide, high prices of Ceylon Tea at the Colombo Auction, decline in tea quality in addition to the US sanctions imposed on some of the middle- eastern countries and Russia  who are the major buyers of Ceylon Tea  are some of the key factors causing a considerable impact on the industrys growth.
According to recent reports, tea production experienced a dip in 2018 as the production from January to July 2018 recorded 182.2 million kg in comparison to 182.4 million kg, recorded over the same period in 2017. Tea exports too have been sluggish over the last few years, where the first 7 months of 2018 recorded 162.7 million kg in comparison to 165.3 million kg over the same period in the previous year. Nevertheless, as a major contributor to the national economy, the tea industrys revenue showed slight positive results in the first seven months of 2018, recording a revenue of Rs. 134 billion, reporting a Rs. 2 billion increment from the previous year.
In order to draw attention to these matters, this years annual general meeting of the Tea Exporters Association was held under the theme Thinking Out of the Box. The objective was to create a unique platform to convene industrys key stakeholders under one roof, to exchange intellectual views and devise an innovative, pragmatic and strategic solution to address these issues.
Elaborating on the importance of supporting the tea industry, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said, Our economy has expanded towards the non-tradable sector. Since 2015, weve been trying to restructure the economy and return to the tradable sector. We need to treat our plantation industry and its exports as tradable goods. At present, youre working in a labour shortage economy, which demands more productivity per person. We have to promote Sri Lankan brands, but promoting alone is not sufficient. You also have to see how you can make the industry more competitive and modernized.
The Prime Minister also reiterated on taking steps to revive the tea industry through medium and long term approach. He further added, Tea industry should consider how to maximize its production, just as much as to maximize its prices. The government will step in and offer more funding and support - whether youre a small holder or large planter.
Minister of Plantation and Industries, Navin Dissanayake addressed the gathering, emphasizing on addressing the pressing issues of the industry. Sharing his views Minister Dissanayake said, I have advised the tea board to be very strict on tea producers that sully the pure Ceylon Tea brand. In fact, 6 months ago we raided 60 factories suspected of mixing sugar with tea. We have taken steps to reduce corporate tax for bulk tea from 28% to 14%, for 2018  19. Promotion levy will be down by 50% from 2019, dropping from Rs. 3.50 to Rs. 1.75 a kilogram. We will be allocating a total of Rs. 1 billion for brand promotion for Ceylon Tea exporters. In addition, we hope to spend Rs. 3.5 billion on the global campaign, expected to be on track by November.
The Minister also underscored that any fall in price of tea will have a tremendous social impact. He further noted, At present, we are working on a 100 million dollar loan from Japans Mitsubishi Bank to modernize tea factories with green energy. ADB too has offered another 100 million dollar loan for the upgrade and we are confident within the next 7-8 months we can access this fund. Its crucial we have chief funding available for us to upgrade and fuse this industry with technology. And I believe tea exporters will join hands with us on this venture.
Addressing the gathering, Chairman of Tea Exporters Association, Jayantha Karunaratne said, This is one of the most difficult times for the tea industry. Ten years ago, Sri Lanka used to supply 8% of the world`s Tea production, but now it has declined to 5.4%. Our major markets -Russia, Iran and Turkey, are under tremendous pressure due to sanctions or currency issues. And this has significantly dropped their buying power.
Automation of the Colombo Tea Auction will lead to higher efficiency and reduction of cost. We need to continue our promotion and marketing campaigns for Ceylon Tea and Sri Lankan brands and look for avenues for increasing our premium tea exports and providing Tea at affordable prices for the economy segment. We have selected Out of the box thinking as our theme today. We need to make certain changes to our traditional strategies to be more competitive in the global market. So Out of the box is the theme and challenge for all Tea sectors, Karunaratne concluded.
Chief Growth Officer and Member of MAS Apparel Board, Nathan Sivagananathan who delivered the key note address said, Sri Lanka celebrated its 150th anniversary in tea industry. We now place the question, whether the industry will survive another 150 yrs. The world tea consumption has grown at an average of 4.5% a year in the last decade. However, tea production in Sri Lanka is stagnant. We are not truly capitalizing on the rising global demand for tea - a 70 billion dollar industry being driven by growth in value added segments.
Sivagananathan further explained that tea industry is also facing competition even from countries like Bangladesh and African region. Tea imported to Britain in 2016 was only 3% from Sri Lanka, but 47% was imported from Kenya. A major issue common to both tea and apparel industries was low productivity and the labour shortage. The second challenge is the undiversified export market, as we are depending on Russia, and the Middle East - both facing crisis. People in the tea industry have made ad hoc policy changes. Its vital that all policy on the major export sectors are kept the same.

Two Koreas to hold third summit
SOUTH KOREA: The leaders of the two Koreas will hold a summit in Pyongyang in September, Seoul said Thursday, as the Norths leader Kim Jong Un renewed his commitment to the denuclearisation of the flashpoint peninsula.
The announcement of the September 18-20 summit -- the third between Kim and South Korean President Moon Jae-in this year -- comes as US efforts to dismantle the Norths nuclear arsenal have stalled.
The two leaders will meet in the North Korean capital to discuss practical measures to denuclearise the Korean peninsula, South Korean National Security Advisor Chung Eui-yong told reporters.
Chung flew to the North on Wednesday where he handed over a personal letter from Moon to Kim, as Seoul seeks to kick-start the diplomacy that led to the landmark summit between US President Donald Trump and the North Korean leader in June, where they pledged to denuclearise the Korean peninsula.
But no details were agreed at the Singapore summit and Washington and Pyongyang have sparred since on what that means and how it will be achieved.
However, in his meeting with Chung, Kim renewed his commitment to that goal, North Korean state media said Thursday.
The two Koreas should further their efforts to realise the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula, Kim was quoted as saying by KCNA.
It is our fixed stand and... will to completely remove the danger of armed conflict and horror of war from the Korean peninsula and turn it into the cradle of peace without nuclear weapons and free from nuclear threat.
The pledge comes after Trump, frustrated with a lack of progress on disarmament, last month cancelled Secretary of State Mike Pompeos trip to Pyongyang after the North reportedly sent a belligerent letter to the US leader.
Kim made it clear that his trust in Trump remains unchanged despite the difficulties, Chung said, and expressed his intention to work closely with the US and achieve the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula in the first official term of President Trump. But the North Korean leader also expressed a sense of frustration with the international community for not appreciating what he called Pyongyangs very significant and meaningful steps, Chung said.
Kim noted the North had dismantled its nuclear test site in Punggye-ri, where nuclear tests have been made impossible for good, according to the South Korean envoy.
Chairman Kim asked us to convey the message to the US that the US (should) help create situations where he would feel his decision to denuclearise was a right move, Chung added.
North Korea has demanded that Washington agree to formally end the 1950-53 Korean War, and accused it of failing to reciprocate goodwill measures.
But American officials and conservatives in the South are concerned such a declaration would weaken the US-South Korea alliance and deprive the 28,000 US forces stationed on the peninsula of their deployment rationale.
Kim dismissed such worries, Chung said, and told the South Korean delegation that a formal end of the Korean War would not be linked to the withdrawal of the US troops. - AFP

UNP 72nd Anniversary
Thousands sheltered during last two years
United National Party Deputy Leader and Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa, whilst applauding the leadership given by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, said the partys 72nd anniversary was particularly momentous since it had laid the foundation to build over 2,500 model villages.
Minister Premadasa was speaking at the 72nd anniversary of the United National Party at Sirikotha yesterday.
When we took over, we did not realise the extent of the housing problem in the country. The Prime Minister not only allocated the funds but also supported the model village projects wholeheartedly, the Minister said.
He said that during the last two years the government had laid the foundation for thousands of model villages whilst providing many disadvantaged families a place of their own to call home.
We will not stop here. In the second phase of the project, we wish to do 5,000 and later 10,000. There will be altogether 20,000 projects, he said. The positions we hold are temporary. While we are holding these positions, we must do our utmost for the people, the Minister said.
They could not organise a rally, how can they run a country
United National Party Assistant Leader Ravi Karunanayake said at the partys 72nd anniversary that the commemoration was particularly important because the rally organised by the Joint Opposition which promised to oust the government, was an overnight failure.
How can you trust a party to run a country when they couldnt even organise a protest, he said.
He vowed to bring a bigger crowd to Colombo when the UNPs turn comes to organise a rally. The strength of this party cannot be quelled by paying protestors to attend rallies.
We will govern till 2020 and beyond, he said.
The former Minister recalled victories of the UNP governments and said that the party formed a coalition government in January 2015, and still leads it.
This is the only political party that unite people from various faiths and all walks of life, he said.
It is matter of pride for us to stand by the party and propel its policies forward, he said.
UNP unrivaled
United National Party (UNP) National Organiser Navin Dissanayake said at the 72nd anniversary of the party that the party has seen the election of seven leaders and office-bearers were through secret ballots, a tradition which he believes should be upheld and continued.
These office-bearers were elected through the secret ballots and it shows the political tradition of this party, he said. There is a reason why many of us were not made leaders of ministers from the get-go. We were all groomed to be where we are, he said.
Minister Dissanayake said the former President was trying to groom his son to take over the mantle of the party bypassing Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa.
Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa was a no-show at the rally the other day, he said. It is clear what their intentions are. But they should take a cue from the UNP, he said.
Minister Dissanayake said bloodshed will be in the country if the former regime returns. They will continue their tradition of corruption, he said.
SLPP lost little support they had
United National Party General Secretary and Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said at the 72nd anniversary of the party at Sirikotha that the Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna (SLPP) lost what little support they had by organising a shoddy protest.
No person or group which has stolen so much from the masses could get away or muster enough courage or support to organize a protest, he said. Failure of their protest proves that point, he said.
When the UNP protested and fought back, we did so with a purpose. What was the purpose of the Jana Balaya, he queried.
For the last 29 years, we could not form our government, he said. But we have got this far now and weve set our sights on the Presidential election,he said.
He said the partys defeat at the local government election enabled the party to turn over a new leaf and strengthen their mandate of fulfilling their promises.

Worlds first test-tube cubs
The birth of the world's first test-tube lion cubs could mark an incredible breakthrough for saving highly endangered big cats, scientists say.
A lioness gave birth to two cubs in South Africa - a male and a female - created through artificial insemination.
The feat could offer hope for saving species like the tiger and the snow leopard who are threatened by extinction, researchers claim.
A team of experts at the University of Pretoria pioneered the research into in-vitro fertilisation (IVF) for big cats.
They harvested the sperm of a male lion, which was placed inside the lioness and she gave birth to two healthy cubs three and a half months later. Both cubs, who were born at the Ukutulu Game Reserve and Conservation Centre, have been given a clean bill of health. Professor Andre Ganswindt of the University of Pretoria Mammal Research Institute said, There are tremendous threats to wildlife due to the loss of habitat and other pressures created by human activities which also affect big cats. That is why a number of species are listed as vulnerable or endangered but this research could combat the threat of extinction facing several types of big cat around the world.
The South African study examined artificial insemination protocols for the female African lion, but the research could be used as a baseline for other endangered large wild feline species.
Professor Ganswindt said this research was carried out as a pre-emptive measure to ensure techniques were developed before a big cat species was critically endangered.
He said, To have the opportunity to stabilise populations even with artificial breeding you have to have the necessary techniques well ahead of the time when it necessary. That is why you cannot develop these techniques on a critically endangered species. In South Africa we have a relatively stable lion population and that allows us to use lions as the forefront species to collect the knowledge for techniques to be used on endangered species.
The project's main researcher Dr Isabel Callealta said, The next step is to continue looking for the right protocols for the large feline species which is good news for endangered big cats. This was a world first for lions and now we start a journey and the idea is to improve or knowledge and understanding of the big cats and move the research quickly forward. The research will hopefully mean we can start working towards carrying out similar procedures on some of the much rarer big cats like the snow leopard and the tiger in the future.
The owner of Ukutulu Game Reserve and Conservation Centre Willi Jacobs, 60, added: 'Lionesses have between one and four cubs and our lioness gave birth to two so that was very normal.
They are both absolutely perfect cubs in every way and we decided to honour the researcher Isabella by naming the female cub after her and the male cub after her fianc Victor. When they are big enough they will be introduced to the other lions but that will be some time yet but meanwhile they are happy and healthy and playful and leading us a merry dance. This research although done on lions will benefit all the highly or critically endangered species in the world and will benefit so many types of big cat close to the danger of extinction.
Ukutula, in conjunction with University of Pretoria and international researchers, established the conservation centre, laboratory and biobank at the beginning of 2017 for scientific research.
There are thought to be less than 4,000 tigers left in the wild in Asia and less than 7,000 snow leopards in the mountains of Central Asia and as few as 300 Iberian Lynx in Spain.
In Africa there are 18,000 lions left in the wild thanks to successful conservation and breeding.
