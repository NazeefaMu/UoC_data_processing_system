Romance so white
Alison Flood
Readers, writers and editors of romance books are grappling with the genres record on diversity, after a week where a report found that books by authors of colour were on the decline, an imprint specialising in diverse romances closed, and another publisher was forced to apologise for telling a writer they avoided putting people of colour on book covers because they didnt sell.
Queer romance writer Cole McCade came forward last week to reveal conversations with editor Sarah Lyons of the New Jersey-based publisher Riptide. McCade, who also writes as Xen Sanders, described Riptide as at all levels hostile to me as a person of colour. He published an email from Lyons in which she told him: We dont mind POC But I will warn you  and you have NO idea how much I hate having to say this  we wont put them on the cover, because we like the book to, you know, sell :-(.
Unacceptable move
Lyons has since resigned. As Riptide authors came forward to ask for their books to be pulled from the publishers list in the wake of McCades revelations, the publisher issued a statement saying it had accepted Lyonss resignation, describing her behaviour as unacceptable and said that it did not condone Lyonss comments about people of colour on covers.
But the uproar continued to grow, as authors and readers shared Riptides previous missteps: in 2016, it apologised after one of its novels featured a black character who was referred to as Dark Chocolate Love Monkey; earlier, it also apologised for a website for a series set in a world where slavery remained legal, which included fake ads for buying and recruiting slaves.
Riptide issued a subsequent statement in which it acknowledged that apologies are not enough, and that the anger that has been directed toward us in the past days is justified. It has closed its doors to unsolicited submissions, and returned rights to angry authors who have sought to dissolve relationships with us.
Missed past
We need to prune the aspects of our company, our attitudes, and our message that are rotten. Its time for us to take a good, hard look at ourselves and foster new, diverse voices to help us see what weve missed in the past, said the statement from co-owners Rachel Haimowitz and Tal Valante.
But the controversy arrives as a report into diversity in the genre found that fewer books by authors of colour were published in 2017 compared to the previous year, despite an increase in the numbers of books published overall.
Clearly there is plenty of room to pull up more chairs as long as the people sitting in those chairs are white, wrote the reports authors, Bea and Leah Koch, who run the romance bookstore The Ripped Bodice, in Culver City, Los Angeles. The report revealed that for every 100 books published by the leading romance press in 2017, only 6.2 were written by people of colour, down from 7.8 in 2016.
Riptide was one of the publishers included in the Ripped Bodices study, which analysed 3,762 books to identify how many were by authors of colour. At Riptide, 4.8% of its books were by authors of colour, slightly up from 2016; in total, 80% of publishers surveyed had fewer than 10% of their books written by people of colour.
Coloured authors
By far, the best-performing publisher in the report was Simon & Schusters imprint Crimson, with 29.3% of titles by authors of colour. But in the same week as the report, S&S announced that the imprint will close, citing changing consumer reading habits and the continual evolution of the marketplace.
It follows Harlequins decision last year to close its African American romance imprint Kimani, citing at the time changes in the retail landscape and reader preferences, and declining support from retailers
But The Ripped Bodices owners said that their own figures give the lie to the main argument publishers give for not publishing authors of colour: that the sales are not strong enough.
The shop, Americas only bookshop dedicated entirely to romance novels, said that six of its 10 bestselling titles from 2017 were by authors of colour.
I think this shows that the market is so desperate that good books from diverse authors have fantastic selling potential. There is a ton of self-publishing happening by authors of colour, especially because of historical and current attitudes towards diverse books from major publishers, said Koch.
She said it is a complete assumption from publishers that white readers avoid books without white protagonists. My customers want good books that reflect the world they live in, she said.

Fraud, corruption turned Sri Lanka into worlds fourth corrupt country
In a persuasive oration against crime, corruption and fraud, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday, said corrupt politicians, judges, lawyers and religious leaders who protect criminals and thieves, should take responsibility for turning Sri Lanka into the fourth most corrupt country in the world. He requested all corruption-free persons to stand together to rescue the country from this catastrophic situation the country had fallen into.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake pointed out that murderers, drug dealers, fraudsters and other persons involved in all sorts of malpractices, have executed their duty in the best way possible, where as persons who were to take counter measures against these crimes and corruptions have not executed their responsibilities properly. Ramanayake, pointed out that new laws or amendments against crime and corruption are of no use, unless the judiciary is not free and independent.
Ramanayake, while observing that he already had a case filed against him at the Supreme Court on Contempt of Court, was critical of certain former Chief Justices the country had. We cannot call lawyers who appear for criminals and thieves good. We feel only ashamed of them., he said.
Ramanayake while crediting the lawyers for refraining from appearing for child rapists and killers who murdered a young boy at Halawata recently, pointed out that if the judges execute their responsibilities with a strong backbone, they could turn Sri Lanka in to a paradise.
Gotabhaya for example, makes requests to avoid taking him in to custody for any legal inquiry. He, guilty as he is, was requesting for anticipatory bail. Could an ordinary person who steals a coconut or mango, apply for an anticipatory bail Of course they cant. So who should be at the receiving end for this The persons who should be responsible for this plight are the persons who create laws of this nature. The general public wishes ill for all those people who design laws in favour of criminals and fraudsters, Ramanayake said.

Govt will defeat no confidence motion against PM
The government has the strength to defeat a no confidence motion brought against the Prime Minister.
The 40-member Joint Opposition is planning to bring the motion in Parliament with the ulterior motive of destabilising the government, Home Affairs Deputy Minister J.C. Alawathuwala said.
Alawathuwla was speaking to the media after he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya prelates at their temples in Kandy and received their blessings on March 19.
The Deputy Minister said he did not believe that any member of the UNP would support the no confidence motion.
If the members of the SLFP group who are partners of the government wished to support the no confidence motion, they should gracefully resign from their ministerial posts, Alawathuwala said. He said that many people who talked about removing the Prime Minister while being government ministers were those rejected by the people at the hustings.
It was a joke to see those without a mandate talking of removing the Prime Minister, he said.
Alawathuwala said the UNP would undergo a major transformation soon since Prime Minister Ranil Wikcremesinghe too subscribed to the view that the party should receive a change and new orientation.

Steady progress in macroeconomic fundamentals
Sri Lanka is making steady making progress in terms of macroeconomic fundamentals, said Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy.
Speaking at the launch of the Development Process for Sri Lankas National Financial Inclusion Strategy, he said that Sri Lankas headline inflation soared to over 7% in 2017, but has since slowed to 4.5% and is expected to range between 4 to 6% in 2018.
Foreign exchange reserves increased to 7.97 billion US dollars by the end of 2017, from 6 billion US dollars a year earlier. Progress was also seen in developing policy frameworks for long term sustainable growth.
This is reflected in the fact that we had a record year for exports, from a very low base and I must admit there is nothing to write home about that. Our exports are still far too low, but it was a record year.
The same applies to FDI and inflows to CSE, he said.

Yala Toilet Frog named for departing Tea Board chairman
A team of Indian and Sri Lankan scientists led by Dr Sonali Garg of the University of Delhi has discovered that a frog commonly found in Sri Lankas dry zone in fact represents a new, previously-unrecognized species, which they have named Uperodonrohani.
The scientists explain that This species is named after Rohan Pethiyagoda, in recognition of his contribution to biodiversity studies in India and Sri Lanka, especially on frogs and fishes.
The species was named in an 88-page monograph titled An integrative taxonomic review of the South Asian microhylid genus Uperodon published in the journal Zootaxa on 23 February. The authors found that the nearest evolutionary relative of the species, which is endemic to Sri Lanka, is the Indian frogUperodonvariegatus. They characterize the new species by its unique genetic make-up and morphology in addition to the distinctive croaking call made by males. The propensity of these frogs to call loudly in chorus after heavy rains have led the scientists to propose that its common name be Rohans Monsoon Croaker.
Speaking to Daily FT, Pethiyagoda, who is due to relinquish duties as chairman of the Sri Lanka Tea Board on March 21, said he was delighted by the honour. This is one of the two species of frogs most commonly seen in dry-zone bathrooms during the rainy season, he said. In national parks such as Yala and Bundala, it has a reputation for scaring people of a nervous disposition when theyre seated on the potty.
My colleague, the largemammal ecologist Manori Gunawardena, who lives near Yala, emailed me immediately she saw the monograph, said Pethiyagoda. It is a shower, sink and drain resident, she wrote. A lurker in the toilet bowl. It chirps if the shower is on long enough: my water-saving indicator. Uperodonrohani is impervious to flushing and returns to elicit the most expletives [from human users of the toilet]. It is my measure of who gets a re-invite to my house.
Im deeply gratified by having this frog named after me, says Pethiyagoda. And theres an added bonus. Now at last, all the people Ive annoyedin the past have a way of getting even with me next time they go to Yala. If they want to let me know what they think of me,and theres a frog in the toilet bowl, Im sure their actions will speak louder than words. Or they can simply drop the matter.

Affixed with a stamp
There are four main divisions in Kandyan dance. They are Ves, Nayandi, Udekki and Pantheru. Ves dance occupies a very important and prominent place. With the passage of time, Vannam was included in it. There are altogether 18 Vannams. Hence the total categories of Kandyan dance are five.
Kandyan dance is very popular among the Sinhalese population of Sri Lanka. The traditional Kandyan dance is a pure Nirtha dance firmly based on Thala, Laya and Thandava Karna stances, and rhythm. The dance is still practised in Buddhist temple festivals, street processions or peraheras, public entertainment events to welcome political leaders, visitors and foreign dignitaries.
Rigorous and social
Most of the Indian and Sri Lankan classical dance forms are based on Natya Sastra, but these dances developed and were influenced by religious, cultural and social traditions of each region. Kandyan dance appears to have grown and developed out of Natya Sastra, as there are discernible similarities between the classical dance forms of India and those of Sri Lanka.
Kandyan dance form was protected and fostered by the Kandyan gentry who managed and maintained the dance troupes.
Anything printed on the national stamp is regarded as a great honour and state recognition. In the past, stamps played a more important role than today. In modern times, electronic mail or email, WhatsApp, Viber or Facebook are quite popular. Still, the postal mail system is very much needed for certain important purposes. Stamps are not only used for posting letters but also for numerous other purposes including legal documents.
The Ves dance started as a ritual dance form traced back to KohombaKankariya which was also a ritual dance form among the Sinhalese. Earlier, 64 ornaments were worn for the Ves dance, but now less than 34 ornaments are worn.
Unique make-up
Today Ves dance is considered to be based on religious and social values. The Ves dancer's costumes and make-up are unique in nature. Ves dance depicts Thandava stands, jumps, twists, and beautiful masculine and vigorous stands and vast gaps between the legs.
Both the dance forms adopt circular movements and the knees are spread out from one another. They adopt the martial arts techniques. Ves is totally based on pure Nirtha. Ves dance is performed at religious processions, ceremonial and other social occasions.
Males are the dominant artists of these art forms. The drum Geta Beraya is used in Kandyan dance. The word 'Adavu' is used in Kandyan dance which is a pure Nirtha aspect of dance. In the Kandyan dance, the sitting position and stretching the hands at shoulder level are very common. The Ves dance is also based on Natya Sastra.
Earlier it was said that KandyanVes dance had nearly 12 Hastas.
Kathakali dance
In the Ves, dance ears are covered with an ornament called Todu Patti. The ear-ornaments are almost like those used for Kathakali dance.
In Kandyan dance, the Ves dancers wear a chest ornament. It is called Avul Hera. In KandyanVes dance the ornament is tied to the bare body. Shoulder Kavasams are also worn in Ves.
Among all the Sri Lankan traditional classical dances Ves dance occupies a prominent position. First, the Ves dancers image was printed and published on a Sri Lankan stamp in 1950. The value of the stamp was four cents.
Later another image of a Ves dancer appeared on numerous other Sri Lankan stamps. It is worth mentioning here that the image of the Ves dancer was the same in different stamps, but the colour of the stamps differ from one another. The same Ves dancers image was printed on the stamps in ten different colours. The value of the stamps also differs from one another.
The value of dark brown Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 1, peacock blue Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 2. Purplish Ves dancer stamp value at Rs. 3, bluish Ves dancer stamp value is Rs.3.50, bright red Ves dance stamp is Rs. 4. Green Ves dancer stamps are Rs. 5. dark purplish-bluish colour Ves stamp is Rs.10. Brick red Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 13.50. Bluish green colour Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 17. Mustard colour Ves dancer stamp is Rs. 20.
Sri Lankan accompaniment
On another occasion to commemorate the World Tourist Day, a Ves dancer along with accompaniments was published on a Sri Lankan stamp. The value of the stamp is Rs. 5.
Another Ves dancer was printed on a Sri Lanka revenue stamp. The value of the stamp is Rs. 50.

Animal husbandry projects for plantation sector
The government has teamed up with the private sector to introduce animal husbandry projects to the plantation sector in an effort to provide job security to plantation workers and uplift their living standards while transforming loss - making plantations into productive ventures.
This project, endorsed by the Treasury, will also help uplift infrastructure facilities in plantations, State Enterprise Development and Kandyan Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
The Minister was addressing the leaders of worker trade unions attached to the Panwila Galpihilla Plantation Company to introduce this project to the Panwila Hare Park Plantation Company's estates, recently.
Minister Kiriella said the Cabinet approval had been provided to grant land ownership in the extent of seven perches to plantation workers and he was happy to have submitted the Cabinet memorandum in this regard as the Minister in charge.
The land ownership offered to plantation workers could not be annulled by any future government.
The Minister who observed that workers attached to loss-making estates could not obtain an adequate monthly salary, said the new animal husbandry project would enable them to earn an additional income by participating in the dairy industry.

Announce a time-bound plan on pledges to UNHRC -HRW
The Sri Lankan government should announce a time-bound plan to carry out its pledges to the United Nations Human Rights Council(UNHRC) since October 2015, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said yesterday.
At an interim update before the Council this week on progress towards fulfillment of its human rights commitments, UN member countries should press Sri Lanka to ensure justice and accountability for the tens of thousands of victims of the countrys brutal civil war, they added.
In October 2015, the Human Rights Council adopted Resolution 30/1 by consensus in which Sri Lanka pledged to set up four transitional justice mechanisms to promote justice, reconciliation and human rights in the country. These included an accountability mechanism involving international judges, prosecutors, and investigators; a truth and reconciliation mechanism; an office of missing persons; and an office for reparations. Thus far only the Office of Missing Persons (OMP) has been set up. The Council will discuss the high commissioners report this week.
Human Rights Watch welcomed the December action by the government to accede to the Optional Protocol to the Convention against Torture (OPCAT).
Creating the Office of Missing Persons, while a positive step, is just the latest body set up in Sri Lanka to look into enforced disappearances. Reports of prior government-established commissions, some of which have been made public in recent years, have not led to accountability.
Both sides to the conflict, which ended in May 2009 with a decisive government victory, committed serious human rights abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, including extrajudicial killings, deliberate and indiscriminate attacks against civilians, enforced disappearances, and torture. The government should publicly set out when this mechanism will be set up instead of hiding behind various politically expedient excuses, Human Rights Watch said.
Another key outstanding pledge, namely security sector reform including the repeal of the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), also remains unfulfilled. Sri Lanka has a long history of abuses by security forces, both during and after the civil war. The security forces have long used the PTA to detain suspects for years without charge, facilitating torture and other mistreatment. The governments claims to be working on repealing and replacing the PTA with a rights-respecting law have yet to come to fruition.

Best set to captain Ireland at 2019 World Cup
DUBLIN March20: Rory Best, fresh from becoming only the third man to lead Ireland to a Five/Six Nations Grand Slam, looks set to captain them at the 2019 World Cup after signing a new contract on Tuesday.
The Northern Irishman -- who won his 111th Test cap in skippering the Irish to a convincing win over England on Saturday at Twickenham to seal the Grand Slam -- agreed an extension that will see him through to the end of Irelands campaign in Japan next year when he will be 37.
Inspirational fullback Rob Kearney also signed a new contract up to the end of the sports quadrennial showpiece event.
That duo were swiftly followed by Bests Ulster team-mate the 26-year-old 38-times capped second row forward Iain Henderson, who has committed himself to both his province and Ireland till June 2021.
Ireland head coach Joe Schmidt had joked after the England game that Best was certainly getting faster on his Zimmer frame on the pitch.
I am in a very privileged position as captain of Ireland and Ulster to be involved with two groups of incredibly talented players, said Best, who also captained the midweek British and Irish Lions team on the tour of New Zealand last year.
I feel I can continue to make a contribution to both Ireland and Ulster Rugby and am delighted to have extended my IRFU contract to the next World Cup. IRFU Performance Director David Nucifora said Best, who has been captain since the 2016 Six Nations after Paul OConnell retired from Test rugby, fully deserved his new contract.
Rory has been an outstanding leader for Ireland and continues to produce standout performances at the highest level of the game, Nucifora said in a statement issued by the IRFU. AFP

Both teams receive bowling boost for third Test
CAPE TOWN March 20: Both Australia and South Africa acquired a sharper edge ahead of the third test in a finely balanced series as each learned a key bowler could play in the third test starting Thursday.
Mitchell Starc, Australia's match-winner in the first in Durban, has recovered from a sore calf, while Kagiso Rabada, who took 11 wickets as South Africa won the second in Port Elizabeth, has had a two-test ban overturned.
Conditions at Newlands are less likely to assist the fast reverse swing the pair achieved in the first two matches, but with a good covering of grass two days before the match, thepitch should offer more pace and bounce. That could make the accuracy and persistence of South Africa's Vernon Philander and Australia's Josh Hazlewood could be crucial.
Philander has a remarkable record at Newlands, where he has taken 47 wickets in eight Tests at an average of 16.34 but Hazlewood will be playing in his first Test at the ground.
Philander has had mixed fortunes in two Tests against Australia at Newlands.
He made a sensational debut in November 2011, taking five for 15 as Australia were bowled out for 47 in the second innings. He had match figures of eight for 78 in a South African win.
But he could only take one for 158 in the match when a pair of centuries by David Warner led Australia to a series-clinching win in March 2014, the most recent occasion on which a Test has been played at the ground so late in a South African season.
Rabada's availability simplifies South Africa's selection after the hosts named a squad of 17 players to allow for a variety of combinations.
Now South Africa's most likely debates are expected to be whether the extra bounce of Morne Morkel might earn him selection ahead of Lungi Ngidi or whether a fit-again Temba Bavuma should replace Theunis de Bruyn.
Australia are unlikely to make any changes to the team that has represented them in seven successive Tests. In addition to Starc, all-rounder Mitchell Marsh was passed fit after suffering a groin strain in Port Elizabeth.
Following the schedule published before the series, there will be a complete change of match officials for the last two matches. Andy Pycroft of Zimbabwe will take over from New Zealand's Jeff Crowe as match referee, while three English umpires will officiate in the middle and as television umpire.
Likely teams: South Africa: Faf du Plessis (captain), Aiden Markram, Dean Elgar, Hashim Amla, AB de Villiers, Theunis de Bruyn or Temba Bavuma, Quinton de Kock (wkt), Vernon Philander, Keshav Maharaj, Kagiso Rabada, Lungi Ngidi or Morne Morkel.
Australia: Steve Smith (captain), Cameron Bancroft, David Warner, Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Marsh, Tim Paine (wkt), Pat Cummins, Mitchell Starc, Nathan Lyon, Josh Hazlewood.
Umpires: Richard Illingworth, Nigel Llong (both ENG).
TV umpire: Ian Gould (ENG).

Bring human rights violators to book - US
The United States on Monday raised concerns regarding ongoing reports of human rights violations and abuses by members of the security services, and recent attacks targeting members of religious minority communities.
The concerns raised at the 37th Session of the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) in Geneva, also had the US urge the government to hold accountable all those responsible for human rights abuses and violations and to protect religious minorities and their places of worship.
We further urge the government to take additional steps to fully implement the commitments it made in HRC resolution 30/1 and reaffirmed in HRC resolution 34/1, they stated as the HRC resolution 30/1 cosponsored with Sri Lanka was taken up once again by the Commission this year.
We welcome the Governments decision to accept our recommendations on full implementation of HRC resolution 30/1 and on accountability for the governments, including the security forces, human rights violations and abuses, as well as accountability for those responsible for harassment and violence against members of religious minority communities, said the US.
The US delegation also noted that they looked forward to seeing Sri Lankas progress on implementing the UPR recommendations accepted by the government over the next five years.

Business mission from New Zealand to arrive in April
A group of 20 delegates representing 13 innovative New Zealand companies will arrive in Colombo on 2nd April for a 3-day visit to continue forging business and trade links with Sri Lanka.
The delegation, led by New Zealand Trade Commissioner for Sri Lanka, Ralph Hays, builds on the momentum of previous missions and strengthens New Zealands relationship with Sri Lanka ahead of the New Zealand High Commission opening in Colombo in 2019.
Its great to welcome New Zealand businesses to Colombo again, says Dhara Wijayatilake, Secretary General & CEO of the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. Sri Lanka is focused on diversifying its trading relationships and visits from overseas delegations are an important part of developing those connections. This trade mission will provide an opportunity for New Zealand companies to establish and consolidate partnerships with current and potential Sri Lankan business partners.
The New Zealand companies on this mission are a reflection of the countrys diverse economy, representing areas such as medical technology, software and hardware technology, design and construction, marine, and aviation training.
We continue to see strong interest from New Zealand and Sri Lanka in strengthening business relations between both countries, says Hays. Both New Zealand companies as well as the Government are focused on pursuing commercial opportunities in the dairy, infrastructure, marine, aviation and information technology sectors with Sri Lanka.
Two way trade between New Zealand and Sri Lanka has grown by 31% over the past three years, and is now worth NZD367 million Rs. 41.3 billion. The majority of trade in goods is commodity based, but there are increasing opportunities in a variety of sectors including tourism, aviation, agriculture, electronics and education.
Hays leads New Zealand Trade & Enterprises (NZTE) activity in Sri Lanka and South India. He has been with NZTE for 7 years and during this time has been Trade Commissioner and Consul General in Sao Paulo and Business Development Manager for Spain and Portugal based in Madrid. NZTE is New Zealands international business development agency.

Hero Nidahas trophy tri-nation T20 series review
Calm and collected India win with precision timing
Host Sri Lanka and India were the two teams favoured to meet in the final of the Hero Nidahas trophy tri-nation T20 at the start of the series. This assessment came from India - although being weakened by the absence of five of their regular players (who were rested) proving to be still a strong side and on Sri Lankas victories against Bangladesh across all three formats on their recent tour there.
However as the experts would always say without any hesitation that T20 cricket is the most unpredictable of the three formats because any team on the day could upset the odds and win. This is what happened in the Hero Nidahas trophy series that was played to celebrate the countrys 70th year of independence. Bangladesh the least favoured of the three teams to make it to the final turned the form book upside down to beat Sri Lanka in back to back matches in the league stage to qualify to meet India in the final. Even going into the final India who had beaten Bangladesh twice in the league stage were odds on favourites to lift the trophy. But they nearly never did for the way Bangladesh fought back like tigers as they are referred to often. India was stretched to the limit and they had to bring out all their IPL experience in the form of Dinesh Karthik to clinch a win off the last ball.
kusal Perera
They were also to a great extent buoyed-up by the backing the entire Premadasa Stadium gave them. Incensed by the unruly behavior of the Bangladeshi cricketers on and off the field during their league match against Sri Lanka, the fans turned out in their thousands to support India, something which they have not done for decades.
India came for the series with a side that was top heavy in inexperience in the bowling department but they ended up dominating the bowling averages with three of them occupying the top three spots and 18-year-old off-spinner Washington Sundar not only emerging as the leading wicket-taker (with Yuzvendra Chahal) with eight wickets but also picking up the Player of the Series award. The Tamil Nadu spinner came to Sri Lanka having appeared in only one ODI and one T20I in his brief career but distinguished himself during the tri-nation series as a player with a future.
India were however balanced in their batting with the recall of former batsman Suresh Raina and with the presence of experienced batters like skipper Rohit Sharma who led the team exceptionally well getting the best out of his inexperienced squad of players, Shikhar Dhawan, Lokesh Rahul, Manish Pandey and Dinesh Karthik. A loss in the series lung-opener against Sri Lanka didnt quite deter them it only made them stronger for the rest of the matches which they won with clinical precision.
Full credit to Bangladesh for the way they performed in the series Mahmudullah led them admirably for a major part of the league stage before the appointed captain Shakib Al Hasan took over for the crucial and final league match against Sri Lanka and for the final. All-rounder Shakibs presence in the team following a finger injury gave Bangladesh that extra impetus to perform the way they did.
Former captain Mushfiqur Rahim played a match winning innings of 72 not out in Bangladeshs record run chase of 215 against Sri Lanka in a league match. He backed this performance up with another similar knock against India but Bangladesh fell short by 17 runs, Mushfiqur, Tamim Iqbal, Sabbir Rahman and Mahmudullah were the key performers for Bangladesh in their batting, while fast bowlers Rubel Hossain and Mustafizur Rahman were outstanding for them in the bowling department.
Indias victory meant that they were the best team in the tournament and to do so with a virtually second string team that was sans captain Virat Kohli, MS Dhoni, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya  all match winners showed their bench strength, that even their second side was good enough to beat the full strength teams of Bangladesh and Sri Lanka.
Washington Sundar
Sri Lanka who began the series in a flourish by beating India fell away towards the latter stages to lose their remaining three league games twice to Bangladesh. They have a few areas to improve in this format and the balance of the team was also not right in certain matches with more emphasis being laid on all-rounders at the expense of a specialist batsman.
One area that Sri Lanka must address strongly is the slow over rate that has become a result of not only the bowlers taking longer than usual to bowl their overs but the amount of time wasted by the captain having chats with senior players between overs or in the middle of an over. This unnecessary waste of time resulted in Dinesh Chandimal being suspended for two matches that was crucial to Sri Lankas chances of qualifying for the final.
The other factor that went against Sri Lanka was their bowling which just didnt have the resources to contain or take wickets during power plays and at the death.
The Sri Lankan top order with Kusal Mendis and Kusal Perera (at no. 3)  the two main run-getters for them gave the side good starts, but their contributions were not converted into winning ones with a weak middle order that was overloaded with all-rounders some of them half-baked and do not deserve to be in the side for they can neither contribute with bat or ball.
For instance for the return game against India, Sri Lanka replaced batsman Chandimal with fast bowler Suranga Lakmal thus weakening the batting. Lakmal who was playing his first match of the series bowled only two overs for 19 runs. What a waste. Mind you Sri Lanka could come up with a total of 152-9 that was hardly competitive. Then for the crucial return match against Bangladesh they stuck to the same combination replacing only two fast bowlers, but were still short of a specialist batsman. Why a batsman in the caliber of Dhananjaya de Silva (who can also bowl off-breaks) was not considered is rather strange.
Sri Lanka was left to pay a heavy price for these lopsided selections when they were ousted from a place in the final. But the fans found another nation for them to support in the final, and they were not disappointed.
Sri Lanka Cricket for all the controversies they are shrouded with, with their administration should be lauded for conducting an excellent tournament which left no stone unturned towards the manner in which it was held over the two weeks.

Can Vidyartha College break a 51-year-old hoodoo is the question everybody will be asking when they meet St. Sylvesters College in the 60th Battle of the Babes Big Match at the Pallekele Stadium today and tomorrow play commencing at 9.45 a.m. each day.
Vidyartha last won in 1967 under R.M. Lafir, the famous cricketer who played for Government Services and have not tasted success since. This encounter was not played for about eight years, in the 1970s, because of an unfortunate incident in 1973.
Both schools despite are having limited facilities but St. Sylvesters has emerged as one of the top cricket playing schools in the central hills. They have a playground which can be used only for training sessions. Earlier the Police ground served as their venue and they played all their matches, including the big match on that ground. Vidyartha College too has the same problem, but with all that they too have emerged as one of the leading cricket playing schools. They have been playing cricket since 1952, and has reached great heights without a proper playing field. They have a small ground for practices at Nittawela.
Pulina Gunatilleka has led the Vidyartha to be unbeaten this season; they have won their matches against Revata, Horana Taxila and Sri Jayewardenepura MV. Gunatilleka a fine cricketer is a hard hitting left-hand bat. He has scored a century against S. de S. Jayasinghe. The others who have done well are Isuru Prabodha he has scored 644 runs, Chaturanga Dilshan, Kasun Karunatilleka, who has made three 50s, Madunaka Wijetilleka and Ishan Sandeep. The side is coached by one of the finest cricketers to come out of St. Anthonys College Champika Siriwardene who was a firm right hand bat, in the early 1990s.
The Sylvestrians are led by Avindu Herath. He is blessed with some good players but they have failed to win a single match this season but lost to Lumbini, Mahinda and Dharmaraja. For the first time no player has a century to show. Some of the outstanding players are Nimsara Attanagalle, Nirmalan Pavitran, Pasan Hettiarachchi and Manjith Rajapakse. They are coached by their 2000/01 captain Jaliya Weerasinghe who is in his fifth year.
Vidyartha started cricket in 1952 and St.Sylvesters College in 1955. The two teams first met in 1955, and that was the first cricket match of St. Sylvesters. Of the 59 games played so far the Sylvestrians have won 13, Vidyartha 3 and rest have ended I draws.

Cathartic monologues
Title: VishodhaAuthor: Sunanda MahendraPublisher: Sarasavi Publishers
The process of releasing, and thereby providing relief from, strong or repressed emotions. is the way the Oxford dictionary defines the word, Catharsis, and explains the origin,Early 19th century (in catharsis (sense 2)): from Greek katharsis, from kathaire in cleanse, from katharos pure. The notion of release through drama ( catharsis (sense 1)) derives from Aristotles Poetics.
The Encyclopedia Britannica explains it further, Catharsis, the purification or purgation of the emotions (especially pity and fear) primarily through art. In criticism, catharsis is a metaphor used by Aristotle in the Poetics to describe the effects of true tragedy on the spectator. The use is derived from the medical term katharsis (Greek: purgation or purification). Aristotle states that the purpose of tragedy is to arouse terror and pity and thereby affect the catharsis of these emotions.
Early Sinhala
Catharsis is not a word we come across often today, in English usage, or in Sinhala as Vishodhaya. Emeritus Prof. Sunanda Mahendra has not only drawn our attention to Catharsis, but uses his vast knowledge of ancient writings both from the east and the west, but also from his study of poetry in Sinhala and English. We do have a problem when we have forgotten our early Sinhala when we come across words like Vishodhaya. We have to look up the Sri Sumangala dictionary, where the meaning is given only as cleaning up. Rhys Davids and Stede gives cleaning, cleansing for the Pali word. We also face unsatisfactory Sinhala terms like atitha kamaya for nostalgia, for which even late prof. Sucharitha Gamlath had failed to give a suitable Sinhala term. When we come across the word atitha kamaya in this book, it stands out as an oddity. Perhaps that is why the author has to give the English term in brackets. And this nostalgia runs through the book, which too could be considered as cathartic.
We do not have many opportunities for catharsis today, with all the restrictions on our freedom of expression through creative arts. That is why Sunanda Mahendras Vishodha is important and relevant. Gone are the days of the great playwrights who could offer catharsis to the frustrated, helpless common masses suppressed and oppressed by the ruling class. Instead of searching for catharsis today we try to drown our sorrows in intoxicants and with poor comments on social media.
Let us go back to literature and drama to cleanse ourselves, directing our anxieties outwards. Let us begin with Vishodha.
Imprisoned compartments
The author has not called them poetry, he only uses the term meditative monologues. Today we have forgotten that Sahitya includes a lot more than just literature. The writer and the artiste are imprisoned in compartments, labelled as literature, music, painting and dance. He is fettered in what is called the genre, as novels, short stories, poetry and lyrics, further restricting his freedom. Sunanda Mahendra broke out of his fetters and the prison several decades ago, and he has the courage to publish his creative work the way he writes them. Vishodha could pose a problem for our judges of literary panels, not knowing to which category of Sinhala writing they could group it. For Sunanda Mahendra, it may not matter, as he has already made a name in literature both in Sinhala and English, and won state awards too.
Some of the writings here look like dialogues, but if the conversations are imaginary then they are still monologues. Anyway, the writer is playing with words, to put across his thoughts. it is up to the reader to try to interpret in any manner he likes, and understand what is written, in the same way, we look at a painting and try to interpret it. Vishodha can be considered as a collection of paintings using words instead of brush strokes. In Asapuwa soya he tries to elaborate on what he sees as Vishoda, but it does not mean we have to see it the same way. Kavi himi nama tells us that once the string of poetry in our mind dries up we could meditate, then we have achieved catharsis.
Many of the monologues could be read out and listened to. Sunanda Mahendra could be preparing himself for the future when we have to go back to tertiary orality, when we dictate and then listen to what is digitally recorded, and do not have to write or read anything or even be literate.
Interpret aloud
Vishoda is a creative work that could not or should not be reviewed. These paintings have to be looked at, read again and again, sometimes aloud, to be interpreted in our own individual minds. We should not pass on our interpretations, our views, to others connoisseurs, thus putting on blinkers on them.
Sensitivity is what is needed to appreciate the inner meanings of most of these monologues. Let each one of us find our own catharsis through Vishoda. As Sunanda Mahendra writes in Sittam how the painting looks different even to the painter, day by day, we too could see these writings differently every time we read them.

Chosen Chaucer
Critics consider Chaucer as the father of English Literature. He wrote in what is known as Middle English. He was a significant writer in the 14th century. Although his style of witting was far removed from the 21st century what he produced, particularly his The Canterbury Tales contains amusing and humorous stories that have been enjoyed by successive readers up to now. Its really a long poem.
A group of pilgrims while on their way to Canterbury tell each other different stories. Reading these we come to know the life and social setup in England six or seven centuries ago. In terms of Linguistics, the language has a strong influence of the French language, but we are able to read these stories rendered in modern English.
Language of yore
Academics point out that Chaucer modelled his work on some early Italian works. However, he enriched the English language of yore. Besides, he had also served in the Army of Edward III. Therefore, he was a poet, soldier and a diplomat. That could have brought him varied experiences.
An interesting observation is that in his Canterbury Tales, Chaucer describes vividly the scene of the pilgrimage as both a pilgrim and poet. Good literature withstands time and Chaucers works have proven that.
Thats great.
Here now are short reminders on Geoffrey Chaucers work that would stimulate your reading. He belonged to the House of Ulster and we learn that a famous French poem titled Roman de la Rose popularized the dream vision of the pet. In the Canterbury Tales, we notice that 29 pilgrims are travelling. In Canterbury, the Saint Thomas Becket was martyred.
Springtime entertainment
In the General Prologue, the poetic tradition of the Medieval Reverie- the evocation of April and spring find a place. That was lyric that spoke of springtime and all that went along with it.
The mention of Ram signifies dependence on astrology. The pilgrims met at the Inn at Southwark. The structure of the poems is based on the Italian text-The Decameron of Boccaccio. Levels of feudal society in Medieval England are King, Barons, Knights and Villains. The Knight loved chivalry, truth, honour, freedom and courtesy-the poet implies.
There is a line in the Tales- foughten for our faith. Here Feith means Christian Faith and it was included because it was one of the duties of the Knight. The Knight has fought in such places as Alexandria, Prussia, Latvia, Russia and Granada.
Prioress refers to a Nun who is the Head of the convent od Priori. Her name is Madam Eglantine. She speaks in the style of French Stratford-at-Bowe. She feeds her dogs roasted flesh, milk and white bread. In her brooch Amor Vincent Omni. It stands for Love Conquers All. Red and Green are the colours in her rosary.
Various medicines
In the original sense the word, doctor meant a very learned person. The pilgrim doctor had read some of the early writers of medicine such as Esculaopias, Seficorides, Riufus, Hippocrates, Hali, Galen, Averrhoes, Gilbert and Constantine, we learn from the text.
The physician was well-versed not only in medicine but also in astrology as it was closely related to medicine in the Middle Ages. He had trade relations with the Apothecary. Pestilence means the plague. He loved money or gold exceedingly well.
When Chaucer says Wife of Bath: he is not referring to Bath. Bath was the name of a place and his portrait is of a housewife from there. Her profession was weaving. She had had five husbands. The predominant colour of her dress was red and scarlet. Her gap-toot signify her flirtish nature Chaucer suggests.
As we would have noticed, the General prologue to the Canterbury Tales describes various characters who are on their way to Canterbury to visit the shrine of Saint Thomas a Beckett.
The narrator describes the appearance and behaviour of each of them without openly judging them. The characters are a cross-section of medieval British society. The irony is that the characters are far removed from the ideals of their professions and vocations. But the Knight is presented with high ideals.
Interesting tales
The subtle irony and humour make this General Prologue a classic word picture or cartoon of medieval society. I enjoyed reading the Canterbury Tales and the General Prologue prompted me to go and read the different tales. Yow will enjoy. Try.

Ragging, a psychological phenomenon!
Ragging has become the psychological disease, extremely difficult to get rid of, among the university students. Sadly, the students misinterpret and misuse the actual reason for the nativity of ragging. It was introduced because this would be a better opportunity for both juniors and seniors to mingle with and share their difficulties and happiness in a reciprocal way. Both the new students and the seniors should feel cheerful, familiar, and friendly thereafter.
In contrast, the senior students behave in an ugly manner, hurt and spoil the future of the new arrivals who experience psychological and physical harassment for the petty sadistic pleasure of the seniors, who want to show and experience domination, superiority complex, and over the moon in causing pain.
There have been records, during the four years of their studies, the victims did not mingle with those sadistic seniors and isolate themselves from them, causing batch as well as group or individual conflicts and clashes thereafter. Ironically, these offending seniors too hesitate and isolate themselves from the offended juniors even after the welcome party. Thereby the real purpose is lost behind this tradition of ragging in the negative sense and mingling in the positive sense.
As they are already suffering from home-sick, the raggers make the situation from bad to worse. The students are hurt by the filthy words and the corporal attacks which are very ordeal treatments.
The students come from different livelihoods, in which the father is the breadwinner who makes both ends meet. Sadly, after burning the midnight oil for years, they enter the university with lots of dreams to make them true amidst of huge challenges. They enter the university, with the hope of making a bright future and uplift their parents life too. Unfortunately, they are smashed with the shattered hopes.
Top of the inhuman acts, the boys are made naked and gender-based violence also takes place, especially at the hostels. Some unable to bear such mental agonies discontinue their studies and seek jobs to support their family. In the history of the incidents, there have been deaths and suicides taken place. These incidents were the harrowing experience for the new entrants.
The Authority of the Universities and the UGC, without turning into deaf ears, should intervene and take concrete remedy to facilitate the innocent students to complete their higher education with flying colours, without being dropped out. They ought to foot on the university without any fear.
No doubt, the learned people know that education is the only weapon to overcome all sort of difficulties and disparities in life.
At any cost or for any reason, learning right should not be suppressed or disturbed. Be that as it may, youth is a phase of the life and once it passed over those tomfooleries would be felt as follies, the late realization, even by the miscreants. With the vision of life, everyone should act and the vision without action is only a dream.

When Japanese Bombed Colombo in 1942
Conspiracy gone haywire
During World War II Sri Lanka had a dominating power and control of the Indian Ocean and it was strategically important as a stepping stone to India. Following the attack on Pearl Harbour, the East Indies fleet of the Allied forces was rushed to Trincomalee, the worlds best natural harbour. The other airbases at that time were the Koggala, Ratmalana and China Bay in Trincomalee. Sir Geoffrey Layton arrived in March 1942, as the Commander-in-Chief of Ceylon, who enhanced recruitment of military personnel.
The first few days of April 1942 were extremely busy with Australian troops in the Middle East on their way home and East African troops also arriving in Colombo around the same time and took up positions. Squadron Leader Leonard Joseph of the Canadian Air Force arrived in Ceylon too on April 2, 1942. On April 4, 1942, after completing his search mission, Joseph was on his way back to base; around 4 pm Joseph noticed a chain of sticks mounting up on the horizon and against the evening skies. Taking a closer look he saw the objects as seven Japanese aircraft carriers, two cruisers, three warships, and a great number of destroyers heading towards the East coast, about 300 miles away.
Anti-aircraft gunfire
His SOS was picked up and the whole island was alerted. Josephs sea plane was hit by bullets from Japanese aircrafts and it crashed into the sea. Joseph and five other survivors were rescued and transferred to the Japanese aircraft carrier and to Japan, where they were subjected to intense interrogation to ascertain if they have already made an SOS to allied forces inland. All the captured soldiers denied the fact.
Next day, April 5, 1942, the Japanese raided Colombo and Ratmalana. However, the Japanese were amazed when they were driven off by anti-aircraft gunfire. They bagged 31 Japanese aircraft and damaged 24 others. Twenty inmates of the Angoda Hospital and another 18 casualties were recorded.
Several buildings in the vicinity of harbour, two ships; a submarine depot ship, an armed cruiser which were in harbour were badly damaged. It also crippled the Ratmalana airstrip and the railway workshop and running shed. On that fateful Sunday morning when the air raid sirens sounded people preferred to stand and watch at the aircraft formation, overhead Colombo streets instead of taking cover in the underground shelters, located in various parts of the city.
The planes broke formation and dived to bomb and machine gun the noted signs and targets in Colombo. In a second round of high-level attacks, they damaged a number of factories and workshops, as the defence forces found effective anti-aircraft firing a complex job. Several fighter aircrafts were destroyed at Ratmalana. Only the airfield at Racecourse remained untouched during the raids. A merchant cruiser and a destroyer were sunk in Colombo harbour, whilst two cruisers were destroyed some 200 miles west of Colombo. The British suffered heavy losses in aircraft.
The Allied forces in Ceylon next anticipated an attack on Trincomalee and a large Japanese armada -- both warships and aircraft carriers -- was spotted by reconnaissance planes, about 30 miles off the east coast. That same day, On April 9, 1942 Japanese attacked and caused heavy damage to Trincomalee airport buildings and harbour, resulting in many casualties among the sailors and dockyards civil workers. The Allied force engaged in fights with the enemy causing loss of 21 warplanes, and crippling 18 in the Battle for Trincomalee.
House arrest of the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates averted
Dr. H.S.S. Nissanka, the scholarly author recollecting his nostalgic memories of Second World War, wrote in 2009 revealing a secret told to him by Ven. Welivita Saranankara Thera of Malwatta Chapter in a casual conversation he had with him. He says, he was only 11-years-old when the war broke out in 1939. The Japanese bombed Colombo on April 5, 1942. The head of the South East Asia High Command, was staying in the Kings Pavilion. He further says, Lord Mountbatten had his war office at Peradeniya in the Botanical Gardens, and the Headquarters at Kundasale.
The accuracy of Dr. H.S.S. Nissankas version however, was disputed by the most senior journalist in the Kandy region, S. B. Senaratne, who responded to an earlier article by me to another newspaper. He says,Lord Louis Mountbatten rarely lived at King's Pavilion and he lived there only officially. He was never at Kundasale, BUT at Pogolla and travelled to the Gardens at 10 am in an open Jeep
You have quoted H.S.S. Nissanks as saying that a secret had been said by the Mahanayake of Malwatta Venerable Weliwita Saranankara around 1939 - 1945. But, there was no Weliwita Saranankara Mahanayake during that period.
During 1927 to 1945 was Venerable Pahamune Sri Dharmakirthi Sarankara Sumangala Thera and from 1946 to 1955 Venerable Rambukwelle Dharmakirthi Sri Dharmarakshitha Sobhitha Thera. There was NO Weliwita Saranankara Thera during the period of Second World War.
I went further to look into the Mahanayake's of Asigiri at that time. From 1929 to 1947 , it was Venerable mullegama Dharmkirthi Sri Chandajothi Gunaratne Thera. From 1947 onwards was Mahanayake Yatawatte Thera.
The only Venerable Weliwita Sarnanakara of Malwatta Chapter was instrumental in spearheading the bringing of Upasampada into the country from Siam. This Thera was NEVER a Mahnayake of any of the two Maha Vihare's.
Back to our story, the War Council consisting of Gaeoffry Layton, Lord Mountbatten, Sir D.B. Jayatilake, and Sir John Kotelawala had met in Colombo after the Japanese bombed Colombo. The British officials had been suspicious of Asgiriya and the Malwatte Maha Nayake theras that they would support Japanese due to their Buddhist connections.
Therefore, the British High Command had decided to imprison the Maha Sangha of Asgiriya and Malwatte Chapters to house arrest and also some members were to be executed. Sir John Kotelawala and Sir D.B. Jayatilake who realized the unprecedented consequences of the decision if implemented, rushed to Kandy and conveyed the plot to prelates and got the monks to sign a document affirming their allegiance to the British crown, thus averting an extraordinary situation.

Court recalls warrants against Wimal, Jayantha
The Colombo Chief Magistrate yesterday ordered to recall warrants issued against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa and MP Jayantha Samaraweera for not appearing in Court in connection with a case filed against them by the Cinnamon Garden Police.
However, they surrendered in Court through lawyers and made a request to recall the warrant issued against them. The Defence Counsel informed Court that their clients were unable to be present in Court due to the extreme traffic congestion in the Colombo city. They were advised to be present in Court in due course.
Last Monday, the two suspects were not present before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara over an allegation that the NFF leader and five others provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing a disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic. Further magisterial inquiry is fixed for June 12. On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Six suspects including the NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian are currently out on bail.

Ensuring ethnic harmony
Sri Lanka has gone through a very difficult 30 years which saw a devastating conflict that tore the communities apart. It was a conflict that pitted brother against brother, sister against sister. The combatants were all Sri Lankans, except for the fact that they spoke two different languages. Hence the term ethnic divide.
There are different views on the origin of this conflict, but the most common perception is that ethnic discrimination of a particular community led to it. This was partly a result of various actions by extremist politicians who stoked ethnic ambers for their own political gain. However, every Sri Lankan paid a heavy price in the end.
Unfortunately, even after such a brutal conflict, lessons have still not been learned. It is clear that political elements starved of the oxygen of ethnic strife were behind recent attempts to inflame communal and religious passions in Ginthota, Ampara and Digana. Any attempt to destroy the unity between the Sinhala, Tamil, Muslim and Burgher communities in Sri Lanka could have far-reaching consequences especially at time when the country is just emerging from a dark chapter. The Government has prioritized ethnic reconciliation and peace building, but such sinister attempts could take the country back three decades or more.
Our goal now should be achieving ethnic reconciliation. There should no more room for ethnic clashes. This must be our resolution for today, The International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination. Every person is entitled to human rights without discrimination. The rights to equality and non-discrimination are cornerstones of Human Rights Law. Article 1 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (which turns 70 this year) states that all human beings are born free and equal in dignity and rights.
Yet racism, xenophobia and intolerance are problems prevalent in all societies, and discriminatory practices are widespread, particularly targeting migrants and refugees. States are being urged to take comprehensive measures to combat racism, racial discrimination, xenophobia and related intolerance, and to promote tolerance, inclusion, unity and respect for diversity.
This day marks the brutal killing of 69 people at a peaceful demonstration in Sharpeville, South Africa, on March 21, 1960, against the apartheid "pass laws". Since then, the apartheid system in South Africa has been dismantled. Racist laws and practices have been abolished in many countries, and there is an international framework for fighting racism, guided by the International Convention on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination.
However, racial and ethnic discrimination still occur on a daily basis in many countries, hindering progress for millions of people around the world. Racism and intolerance can take various forms  from denying individuals the basic principles of equality to fuelling ethnic hatred. The struggle against racism is thus a matter of priority for the international community.
The theme for this year is Promoting tolerance, inclusion, unity and respect for diversity in the context of combating racial discrimination. This is especially important in the context of the rise of extremist and far-right groups in many countries which have virtually called for an end to immigration and by extension, ethnic diversity. People in multi-ethnic and multi-cultural societies such as ours must learn to tolerate each others beliefs, traditions and languages. This should start from schooldays  Sri Lanka is moving in the right direction by teaching Tamil to Sinhala students and vice versa. When everyone can speak and understand all vernacular languages plus English, most, if not all, misunderstandings can be cleared.
Thanks to such efforts, there is every chance that at least 3-4 decades from now, no Sri Lankan will harbour ill thoughts towards another Sri Lankan because everyone will think he or she is a Sri Lankan first. Such a Sri Lankan identity has eluded us so far  even many official forms still have a field for ones ethnic community, whereas Sri Lankan should suffice. Many other countries in our region such as Singapore have moved ahead of us as they have risen above ethnic labels. We hope that the new Constitution in the making will address this issue.
In the meantime, there should be strict punishments for hate crimes and hate speech that can incite racial troubles. The likes of Facebook have been used to propagate hate and animosity among ethnic and religious communities here and abroad. The Government took the correct decision in temporarily blocking access to certain social media in the wake of unrest in several areas, but now they are back online. Everyone should use these media with a sense of responsibility, since the Government and/or Facebook etc cannot monitor the contents 24/7. Now is the time to unite for the sake of the future generation, who should inherit a peaceful nation.

Rome: Serie A club Fiorentina announced that their training ground will be renamed in tribute to former captain Davide Astori, who died aged 31 earlier this month.
The Italian international died suddenly in his hotel room before a match at Udinese on March 4.
The team's training ground will be renamed the 'Centro Sportivo Davide Astori'.
"We've made this decision because that was his home," said Fiorentina president Mario Cognini. "He went there every day for training and used to spend time there with his family too. We believe that honouring him in this way is the right thing to do."
Astori's number 13 shirt was retired by the club, where he had played for three years.
The centre-back came through the youth system at AC Milan before spending eight years at Cagliari, while he also had a loan spell at Roma. AFP

The 08 impacts that we defined are current and very pertinent as pillars to build solutions on, its also very current, it covers areas from Design to Disposal, it includes production, retail, community, designers, every stakeholder of the supply chain. This makes this movement unique and this summit as the platform where knowledge of subject matter experts is converted into action, we have given a 5 year plan, almost like a report card to see our progress every year.

The countries in different regions of the world are grappling with the issues and this a need to come up with solutions, the reality also is that issues in different parts of the world are different, based on what part of the supply chain they belong to, and the environment they live in.
Sri Lanka has enjoyed high compliance standards since last few years and more companies are joining in to meet the compliance standards, it has managed to set the benchmark in the region.
The Responsible Fashion Movement aims to take this forward by creating an eco-system from Design to Disposal and open this eco-system to any brand or organisation in the world to engage and use the fashion supply chain to make positive impact.
The first edition of the Responsible Fashion Summit saw three panel presentations, staring with the UNESCO Ambassador and a global fashion icon Bibi Russell, who is highly celebrated globally for her work in developing communities under the banner fashion for development.

A gift from the sky!
Guinness World Records has taken a multi-colored shine to a Taiwan university that it says was the site of the longest-ever rainbow.
The record-breaking arc was seen on November 30 last year in the skies over Chinese Culture University near Taipei. It lasted a whopping eight hours and 58 minutes, according to science professor Chou Kun-hsuan.
It was amazing.  It felt like a gift from the sky. ... Its so rare! he told the BBC back in November.
Guinness World Records agreed and will officially declare the rainbow the longest ever recorded at a ceremony at the university on Saturday, according to Taiwan News.
The Taipei area rainbow handily beat the former record-holder, which arched for six hours over Wetherby, Yorkshire, on March 14, 1994.
Rainbows typically last less than an hour. Chou told the BBC he knew he was seeing something special around the four-hour mark and notified students and faculty to take pictures.
When we broke the previous record after passing six hours, I was hardly able to stay seated for lunch, he said. I was so excited. I wanted to make sure we captured the rainbow. But then it did something even more incredible <U+2015> it went on to beat the previous record by another three hours!
The universitys main campus is located in the Yangmingshan mountain range. Conditions common to its winter microclimate are being credited for the rainbows longevity, including a cloud-forming northeast monsoon, sunlight and relatively low wind speeds, according to the Straits Times.

GMOA to take action if provincial health charters signed
The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) would take stern trade union action if governors attempt to sign and implement provincial health charters, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said governors had not yet signed it. At the moment, the health service of the country is an island- wide service. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga issued a gazette notification and declared the health service an island-wide service after the GMOA launched a two-week strike in 1990.
According to Dr. Aluthge, at present, efforts are being made to segment the health service and bring it under the power of provincial councils. Letters had been sent to doctors to enroll themselves in the provincial health service. This is an attempt to divide the country.
The GMOA requested the President to use his powers to stop this procedure. The entire health service would be devastated and all health professionals would have to leave the country if this comes to pass, Dr. Aluthge said.

Government decisions not always popular: Minister Amaraweera
Every decision taken by the government wont be popular. All must look into the future and not focus on the elections when carrying out duties, said Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday.A government must always formulate policies taking the future into account. But when the government formulates such policies, it is criticized and loses votes during elections. We make decisions as the Fisheries Ministry not only by looking at the present but by looking towards the future as well. There will be no fish left if the present fishing community uses all the resources, the Minister said at a meeting held at the Ministry.
Some of our decisions can be unpopular. But we dont take decisions aiming at elections and for praise. We should always look towards the future. But the people dont recognize this importance, he said. The same happened in the issue of fertilizers. We provided organic fertilizers instead of artificial fertilizers to prevent kidney problems and we gave the farmers money to buy the products. But the farmers rejected this method and we didnt have a choice other than to shift to the previous method, the minister pointed out.
It is easy to be in the opposition and criticize the government. The people also prefer listening to them. Yet, the people forget that the ministers in the opposition failed in their duties when they were given the chance, said the minister.

Hour of the Green
Earth Hour, WWFs landmark movement, is set to once again unite millions of people around the world to show their commitment to the planet. As our one shared home faces the dual challenge of climate change and plummeting biodiversity, the worlds largest grassroots movement for the environment aims to mobilize individuals, businesses and governments to be a part of the conversation and solutions needed to build a healthy, sustainable future  and planet  for all.
Having started as a symbolic lights-out event in Sydney in 2007, Earth Hour is now celebrated in more than 180 countries and territories as a global moment of solidarity for the planet. Online, #EarthHour and related terms last year generated over 3.5 billion impressions in the run-up to Earth Hour, trending in at least 30 countries worldwide on the night. The movement has been a game-changer for popularizing climate and environmental action across the globe. As global biodiversity declines at an unprecedented rate, Earth Hour will focus its efforts on galvanizing mainstream support for action on biodiversity and nature.
Biodiversity and nature underpin our lives, our economies, our health, our well-being, our happiness. It is the foundation of our living planet. Today, as we push the planet and its natural systems to the edge, Earth Hour is our chance to use our power, as individuals and as a collective, to demand and take action to protect this web of life in return for all it gives us. For the benefit of all life on Earth and of our own future said Marco Lambertini, Director General, WWF International.
In the past decade, Earth Hour has inspired millions to support and participate in critical climate and conservation projects led by WWF and many others, helping drive climate policy, awareness and action. Among its highlights, the movement has helped in the creation of a 3.4 million hectare marine-protected area in Argentina, a 2,700-hectare Earth Hour forest in Uganda and helped pass new legislation for the protection of seas and forests in Russia.
In 2018, WWF and Earth Hour teams around the world will be using the movement to highlight the environmental issues most relevant in their country or region. In Colombia, people will call for the country to commit to zero deforestation by 2020. French Polynesia is expected to move to protect 5 million square kilometres of its seas to preserve ocean ecosystems. In Guatemala, citizens will raise their voice on the importance of freshwater conservation and in India, people will pledge to shift toward sustainable lifestyles. In Nepal, WWF will mobilize public support for a clean, renewable energy future for all.
We know that Sri Lanka together with the Western Ghats of India is endowed with a rich biodiversity and considered, one of the biodiversity hotspots in the world. Said Abdul Qadir Uvais, Country Representative and Manager of Earth Hour. However High population density and expansion of the human environment are increasingly threatening Sri Lankas biodiversity, which may lead to the extinction of species. Further added Uvais. As a country which has ratified the UN Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD) in 1994, Biodiversity conservation is a responsibility of all Sri Lankans, said Uvais. He further added that People are just one part of Earths vast web of life and most of the resources we use come from the environment. Thats why we have to do our part to protect the Environment around us!
When asked about what actions individuals can do to be part of this global Earth Hour campaign, the local Earth Hour Country Manager and Coordinator, Abdul Qadir Uvais had this to say;
Starting today, supporters can visit connect2earth.org to share what biodiversity and nature mean to them in the places they live in and find out more about it.
Created in partnership with the Secretariat of the United Nations Convention on Biological Diversity, the platform aims to build mass awareness on the values of biodiversity and nature by kick-starting global conversations on issues such as climate action, healthy oceans and sustainable business. The project is supported by Germanys Federal Ministry of the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety with funding from the International Climate Initiative.
"Earth Hour is a testament to the power of a simple idea to inspire people to take action to protect the Earth.
As we take an hour to reflect on the vital role that biodiversity and nature play in our lives, let this be the spark that galvanizes action for transformation to a more sustainable future, said Cristiana Pasca Palmer, Executive Secretary of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
The CBD Secretariat is delighted to be working with WWF, and with people all over the world to build a movement where people and communities make a personal connection with Earth. The reflections, conversations and actions we start today will help protect biodiversity at the local, national and global levels, and lead us on a journey of living in harmony with nature.

International Climate Initiative (IKI)
Since 2008, the International Climate Initiative (IKI) of the Federal Ministry for the Environment, Nature Conservation, Building and Nuclear Safety (BMUB) has been financing climate and biodiversity projects in developing and newly industrialising countries, as well as in countries in transition.
In the early years of the programme, its financial resources came from the proceeds of auctioning allowances under the emissions trading scheme. To ensure financial continuity, further funds were made available through the Special Energy and Climate Fund. Both funding mechanisms are now part of the Federal Environment Ministrys regular budget.
The IKI is a key element of Germanys climate financing and the funding commitments in the framework of the Convention on Biological Diversity (CBD).
The Initiative places a clear emphasis on climate change mitigation, adaptation to the impacts of climate change and the protection of biological diversity. These efforts provide various co-benefits, particularly the improvement of living conditions in partner countries.

How to tackle with time-scarcity
Its something most of us deal with every day, often without realizing its there: a feeling of time scarcity.
We know it well: the feeling of having too much to do and not enough time to do it all.
This is true not only of work  where we have too many projects, meetings, emails, admin tasks, calls, requests, messages  but also of our personal lives. We want to exercise, eat well, meditate, learn something cool, travel, go out with friends, spend time in solitude, go for hikes, read a million books, take care of finances and errands, keep up with podcasts and news and interesting online content and our loved ones on social networks and fascinating people on social media, while finding space for contemplation and quiet.
Whew.
How can we manage to do all of that in what is obviously limited time How can we stuff all our hopes, dreams, tasks and errands into such a limited box
One answer is to do fewer things  simplify by cutting things out of your life, do some things less or not at all. Another answer is to outsource, hire a team, delegate. These are all great options.
But true mastery of the time scarcity demon only really comes from a mindset shift.
We have to address the feeling rather than figure out the logistics of it all. Addressing the logistics (the hows and whats) dont really change the feeling. The feeling will always be there, until we deal with it.
The problem isnt that we have too little time  we all get the same amount of time each day and each week. Its the exact right amount of time, because its all there is.
Its possible that we have too many things to do. But actually the real problem is that we want to do too much in the time we have. The amount of things we have to do is not usually the difficulty, but rather that given how much time we have (lets say a day), we want to cram too much into it.
We want more and more, and are not satisfied with what were actually able to do in the time we have.

Japan-funded SGRA project underway
A Japan-funded project titled Supporting Grassroots Activities through the International Employers and Workers Network (SGRA), is to be implemented in Sri Lanka in 2018 in order to support workers of the informal sector.
The project is planned to be implemented in Sri Lanka on the invitation of Ceylon Workers Congress (CWC) General Secretary Arumugan Thondaman.
A team of CWC officials led by K. Marimuttu attended a tripartite meeting on SGRA in Kathmandu, Nepal, last month. The meeting was attended by representatives from Nepal, Thailand, Vietnam, Laos and Bangladesh as well. This inaugural meeting paid high compliments to the Japanese government and to the Japan International Labour Foundation (JILAF), for the initiatives taken to implement the SGRA project this year in Sri Lanka.
The project would involve organising workers' life support seminars, providing vocational training, bridging existing schemes and establishing mutual aid among workers.
Marimuttu assured the fullest support and co-operation of the CWC for the project:
More than 65 percent of workers in Sri Lanka are in the informal sector. The Japanese governments efforts to reach this sector through JILAF, are commendable and the project would aid the betterment of their lives, he said.
JILAF Deputy Secretary-General Ryo Saito and Deputy Representative Yuki Otsuji plan to visit Sri Lanka in May, this year, to conduct further discussions on the project with MP Arumugam Thondaman.

ICC Womens Championships 1st ODI
Javeria Khans century derails Lankan Women
Javeria Khans second one-day international century was backed by a strong bowling effort as Pakistan strode to a 69-run win over Sri Lanka in the first of a three-match ODI series which contributes to the ICC Womens Championship match.
Khan marshalled the middle order and guided her side to 250/6 in their 50 overs after they were put in. The spinners then struck at regular intervals as the Sri Lankan reply was clipped at 181 in 45.2 overs.
Walking in at No.3 in the fourth over, and with both openers back in the hut by the next, Khan had her task cut out. She proved up to the challenge, with old-school patience and consolidation.
She first concentrated on building partnerships, ensured Pakistan had wickets in hand, and hit out at the death to ensure a good total. As she grew in confidence, she stepped out to spin and swept expertly on either side of the wicket.
Her century came up with a four behind square. She finished unbeaten on 113 in 142 balls, with 15 fours.
Helping her were the middle order of Bismah Maroof, Nida Dar and Sana Mir, who chipped in over stands of 49, 72 and 46 for the third, fifth and sixth wickets.
Natalia Pervaiz on ODI debut enjoyed the perfect cameo, contributing an unbeaten 21 in 20 balls, including the innings only six, straight down the ground.
With their openers sent back early in the reply, Sri Lanka might have hoped their No.3 too would make a dent on the scoreline, and Chamari Atapattu, having taken her time to settle in, was in terrific touch. She struck six fours and a six and was nearing her half-century when she was foxed by the left-arm spin of Nashra Sandhu. She fell for 46 in 57 balls. With seniors Maroof and Mir getting into the act, Pakistan did not allow the new batters to settle in.
Shashikala Siriwardene (44 in 46 balls) attempted to rally the tail, but with half the Sri Lankan line-up back even before the 100 came up, her valiant effort could only prolong the innings. Maroof had three wickets, while Sandhu, who finished with economical figures of 10-3-19-1, also chipped in with a run out.
The second ODI will be played at the same venue on Thursday.
Scores
Pakistan Women 250-6 in 50 overs (Javeria Khan 113 n.o., Nida Dar 34, Sana Mir 27, Natalia Pervaiz 21 n.o., Shashikala Siriwardene 2/24, Chamari Atapattu 2/48)
Sri Lanka Women 181 in 45.2 overs (Chamari Atapattu 46 n.o., Shashikala Siriwardene 44, Sana Mir 2/29, Bismah Maroof 3/17)

JO DIVIDED ON PMS MOTION
There were flareups at the Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group meeting yesterday over the proposed No Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Dissenting views have been expressed by JO members over submitting the NCM. JO MPs Ramesh Pathirana, Nimal Lansa, Prasanna Ranatunga and Kumara Welgama had severely criticised the move to bring in an NCM against the PM stating that it was an imprudent move. They had pointed out that the NCM might belittle the recent achievements of the JO.
They had stated that the content of the NCM does not give a clear picture. They had questioned as to who would take the position of PM, if Wickremesinghe was defeated.
However, sources close to the JO said MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage had proposed to submit the NCM despite not knowing whether it would garner the required majority or not. According to JO sources, the NCM has been signed by about 52 MPs.
However, a large number of SLFP members in the Government ranks had refused to sign the NCM. When MP Lansa had approached Ministers Dayasiri Jayasekara and Chandima Weerakkody, they had stated that they would not sign the NCM.
The idea for the NCM was put forth by UNP State Minister Palitha Range Bandara and the SLFP promoted it. But now, it is the JO MPs who have had to shoulder the entire burden, MP Lansa had stated.

Kandy unrest: Cabinet approval for special loan scheme for affected businesses
Cabinet yesterday approved the proposal made by Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella to provide concessional interest loans to businesses affected by the recent unrest in Kandy.
Minister Kiriella had pointed out that it was important to rebuild the damaged properties of the business community in Kandy as soon as possible and thus a concessional loan system needs to be introduced with the support of the state banks. He thus proposed that Cabinet approve the Athwela Loan Proposal System which was adopted for victims affected by the floods in 2017, for businesses in Kandy.
This system grants loans at an interest rate of 2 percent. Businesses will soon be able to apply for this loan on the recommendation of the District and Divisional Secretaries in the affected areas in the Kandy Administrative District.

Kunderas old curiosity shop
Since enjoying the creative world titled Unbearable Lightness of Being written by Czech writer Milan Kundera, I was hunting for all his other works translated into English. Kundera seems to have come to the limelight as a result of some of his books getting banned his own country. It was a controversial issue in the world of literature why his book got banned.
One of the foremost collections of short stories titled as Laughable Loves was banned Czechoslovakia in 1968. But the book in English translation became well known. Though read and left somewhere, I rediscovered the world of Kunderas creative observation plus insights to human life via these seven short stories. Though moth-eaten in several pages, I still managed to wade through the contents resourcefully.
A boy meets a girl
The first short story in many ways cannot be classed as a conventional narrative that one comes across in various other collections. The story is titled as The Hitchhiking Game and runs to 12 short episodes where the central experience is the boy meets girl, but with a sharp different in each episode similar to a series of film shorts. The boy is a carefree individual who is described as a driver of a vehicle in which the gas indicator points nearly to the empty.
But he drives until he finds a gasoline station. At this juncture, he encounters a young girl who needs a ride. Then comes the second episode where they come to know each other, where they talk about matters they agree and disagree. At times the dialogues that ensue are more or less philosophic and poetry two different types of attitudes with agreeable moments. The narrative line develops to point when in the other episode developing gradually into intimacy dispelling their disagreement.
At one moment, Kundera creates the following sentences analysing the innerness in the two characters.
The girl was grateful to the young man for every bit of flattery, she wanted to linger for a moment in its warmth and so she said. Youre very good at lying.
Do I look like a liar
You look like you enjoy lying to women, said the girl and into her words there crept unawares a touch of the old anxiety, because she really did believe that her young man enjoyed lying to women.
Jealousy and intimacy
What happens to the reader who browses the pages The reader is made to involve in the situations as created by Kundera with a sense of simplicity as well as an underlying complexity. Kundera depicts the nature of the concept of jealousy, sexuality, intimacy and at the same time, he shows the light-heartedness of the two characters, the challenging factor to law and morality as the episode after episode pass the reader is made to know that at a place called Nove Zamky it was already getting dark.
Both of them seem to have come a long way, which seemingly is symbolic of the travails in ones lifetime. Then they come to terms when the young man asks the girl:
May I ask you where you are going, Miss
She shows no sign of any particular place or destination. This is followed by stating that both of them had a curious game of staying in an inn. They go on staying and it looks in the world of the writer a curious game.
The narrative does not end in the usual way of a departure. The things happen from moment to moment as in some of the short narratives to Sartre. The episode 12, which is the high point, states:
The young man began to call compassion to his aid, so as to be able to calm the girl. There was still thirteen days vacation before them.
The short narrative titled as Let The Old Dead Make Room For The Young Dead is by and large an eye-opening experience written in fourteen short episodes. The narrative revolves around a widow who visits a far-off cemetery to pay respect and honour her dead husband and thirty-five years ago. But she finds that the place in the cemetery is made to be untraceable as the fees for renovating has not been duly paid.
Memories of sorrow
But in her lamentations and grieving moments, she comes across a gradually ageing man who talks to her and tries to share her sorrows. It looks as if they have met each other some time ago, but at the same time, the factor of time had made both of them wipe their memories off. Both of them seem to be in need of the intimacies of life. But at the same time, they have certain barriers that prevent them being intimate.
A sensitive reader may find that though nothing happens drastically in the manner of a trick-ending, the two characters are made to reveal their innernesses. Thus, though a simple narrative it is nevertheless a complex human situation is presented via verbal pictures. One such example comes in this manner as the conclusion.
Before her eyes, she still saw her sons derisive face and when now her host drew her to him by force she said: Please leave me alone for a moment, and released herself from his embrace.
The story titled Nobody Will Laugh is a narrative which evokes a sense of humour when one self-esteemed writer who had completed a research work on an obscure subject tried his best to get a review of it in order to promote. In this direction, he gets around a scholar who seems to know about the topic related to the work. However much the researcher tries to get a favourable review, he finds it a futile effort as the scholar evades the issue in various forms.
This narrative pokes fun at the academics and their academia. As such, the scholarly lecturer says: Nothing would make me happier than to write a review of your work. But as I explained to you in my letter, I am not considered an expert on the Czech 19th Century and in addition, I am on bad terms with the editors of Visual Arts Journal who take for a hardened modernist so that a positive review from me could only harm you.
In this manner, the narrative experiences and the form differs with a number of human situations. In this collection, Milan Kundera shows with skill the creative standpoint in narratology, surpassing the limitations of mere storytelling.

Kusa in Love
Irangani Kalutanthri, currently domiciled in Canada, is on holiday here in Sri Lanka. At the invitation of drama enthusiasts, she has revived her masterpiece Dutugamunu and is now ready with her second presentation Kusa Adara Kathava based on the love legend of Kusa Jatakaya.
The beautiful, heart-rending, love legend is presented very passionately selecting the most moving episodes, with a creative environment, and combined with beautiful lyrics and melodies, lingering long in the memory, it will entice audiences all ages. In Canada, with the talents and capabilities of the Sri Lankan expatriates, Kalutantri has successfully produced and presented Kusa Paba, to an audience filled to full capacity, mesmerizing them. She has done a few more productions such as Glimpse of Lanka, Pride of Lanka, Shadows of Life, Abhimana Lanka, and Light of Asia and helped further illuminate the prestige of the mother country.
I am a passionate lover of drama, to be more specific, lover of Art forms, music, dancing and, the entire aesthetic field. I have been active in this field for more than three decades. But I have never enjoyed such a blessing.
Kalutanthri finds it hard to imagine how to garner some sponsorship. Quite strange, yet very true, this world needs a crowd to recognize the value of the arts in a community. It is important in todays culture to be able to offer our community the being of what the arts can teach us.
Oscar Wilde says: I regard the theatre as the greatest of all art forms, the most immediate way in which a human being can share with another, the sense of what it is to be a human being.
Kalutanthri is pleased to offer good theatre to her patrons. Sadly though with todays skyrocketing cost of production, it is rather difficult or unaffordable to engage in this philanthropic exercise.
Fine Arts have therapeutic value and bring tranquillity to the human mind.
Kusa Adara Kathawa will go on the boards at Tower Hall, Maradana, on April 1 at 2.30 and 6.30 pm. The cast includes a group of talented amateurs, chosen from the ocean of talents in Sri Lanka: Mulinda Bandara, Nalanda Kularatne, Meena Laxani, Sachini Nivarthana, Renuka Wijesinghe, Shanika Sewwandi, Shanaka Perera, Lakmal Wasantha, Champika Bandaranayaka, Sanjeewa Madushanka, Indika Chathuranga, Tharushi Hanshini, Dimuthu Danushika and Gayan Chathuranga, Music direction is by Lalith Amarasinghe, make-up by Palitha Abeylal, Directed and Produced by Irangani Kalutanthri and presented by the Youth Aesthetic foundation.

I was also in the Interact Club, I have been involved in the Mother Sri Lanka project. I also completed Girl Guiding and got the Presidents Guide award in 2016. I was in the Drama Club and Leader of the Western band in 2014, stated Ranasinghe.
Ranasinghe points out that too often in this world we see those in authorities trying to intimidate their followers rather than being diplomatic. A leader needs to take into consideration everyones opinions. That is what she does.
A leader should be respected but not feared. You need your team to work with you. They should not be afraid to ask questions. You have to earn their respect but not be feared. That is very important. Always get others opinions when working, because making your own decisions in a huge team as the Prefects Guild of Sujatha can cause conflicts sometimes. So you need to be careful about your decisions and not make them alone. Always work with the team, and as much as possible try and take all of them with you forwards so no one gets left behind. That is also very important, said Ranasinghe
Ranasinghe is doing her A/Ls in biology right now. The main goal is to become a doctor. No doubt Ranasinghe has the correct temperament for a doctor. She is adamant that responsibility is important in any position of leadership. A leader cannot shirk his or her responsibility.
Team player
To be a good head boy or head girl you need a sense of responsibility. That is very important. You also need to be a team player. You have to work with your team and you cannot do this alone. You have to be humble. It is very easy for this position to get to your head, added Ranasinghe.
As a leader, you need to be like a rock. Yes, you need to be diplomatic and flexible, but you need to be unyielding when things get difficult.
You have to be strong even though you might have problems. This is because your team depends on you. You have to keep up the morale of the team. I admire Nelson Mandela who is a very great leader. I also admire Martin Luther King Jr. and Michelle Obama. Obama is someone I admire a lot. Michelle Obama is a strong female and all of her speeches are really empowering and through her words, you can feel her confidence. She also believes in what she talks about. Nelson Mandela and Martin Luther King Jr. both fought against racism. Their leadership and their ability to make a difference in the world is something I admire a lot and their legend lives on. I feel when leading a country your main concerns should be the concerns of your people and that you should be fair and just. Adhere to the law of the country yourself. Build bridges between communities, bridging the gap between poor and rich, pointed out Ranasinghe.
She is a good head girl because of the support she has received from her parents and teachers. But credit must go to Ranasinghe since she has made the correct choices in life.
A head girl must definitely be an example to others. She should adhere to the rules first before telling others to follow the rules. She should lead by example and not just give advice. One issue in the world I feel strongly about is gender inequality. That is rather a big issue in the world. I think in society we need to eradicate hypocrisy. I am doing my part as much as possible by not being judgmental or hypocritical, said Ranasinghe.
Overwhelming task
Sometimes we all feel nervous especially when facing problems that may seem overwhelming. But as the leader, you need to stay on until the very end and see the task through. You need to handle the situation from the beginning to the end. You need to stay on top of things.
When facing a nervous situation, if you know that you have done everything in your power, then you will feel much better. As much as possible try and save the situation. But dont stress about it, because stressing about it will not help at all. So stay calm, do what you can and hope for the best. Anticipation and planning beforehand can solve a lot of problems. Thinking ahead is important, so when something happens we know what to do. If it is unexpected, work according to the situation with the logistics you have at the moment, explained Ranasinghe
Ranasinghe stressed that it is important for you to remember what you learnt in school. The experiences you gained are invaluable. The advice your teachers give you is also important. Those things really matter a lot.Announcing at Golden Parade Mini Carnival

Long story cut short
Title: Foot Steps of a Long JourneyAuthor: Prem Goonawardena
Prem Goonawardena a retired career Diplomat launched his Autobiography at a well-attended meeting of members of the Lions Club International. District 306 A2, held at the Aqua Pearl Hotel in Moratuwa recently.
It was also an occasion to commemorate the Founder of Lions Movement a century ago, of Lion Melvin Jones, an American businessman in Chicago in the USA. The Chief Guest on this occasion was Lion Dharma Dheeraratna a Past District Governor of Lions Clubs, a retired Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, and presently the Chairman of the Commercial Bank.
Honours bestowed
In his Autobiography Prem Goonawardena traces his ancestry going back to 19th century. Among other events, he describes the honours bestowed on his Grand Father by the British Rules. He mentions his birthplace at Opatha in Galle District and describes his secondary education at Deniyaya Central College. A beneficiary of the Free Education introduced by late C W W Kannangara, Father of the free education of Sri Lanka, Prem secures employment in Government Service on completion of his secondary education. A thirst for knowledge and desire to do well in life prompts him to study further and enter the University and obtain the BA Degree from Sri Jayawardanapura University. His untiring efforts to join the Sri Lanka Foreign Service paves the way to be selected and posted to our Embassy in Peking in the Peoples Republic of China. China at that time was under the iron rule of Mao-Tse-tung and he describes the events during the Red Guards Cultural Revolution. He also describes his visits to various places of interest including a visit to the Great Wall at a time foreign visits were highly restricted.
Subsequently posted to our High Commissions in London he describes his life in England in those days including a visit to Buckingham Palace to participate in a Garden party hosted by the Queen Elizebeth. On the conclusion of his tour of duty in the UK he asks for no-pay leave to complete his M B A Degree and when the request was turned down, he was compelled to resign his post in Foreign Service.
In the next Chapters, he describes the ordeal he had to undergo to find a suitable employment despite his high qualifications in Marketing and Business Management. Eventually he enters the British Civil Service, where his chances of promotion were blocked by the authorities, and consequently, he leaves in disappointment and joins the British Underground Railway as a Management Executive. He describes various events in the Railway Service where he retrieves and returned to the owner a briefcase containing very valuable documents and cash. Meanwhile, Prem Goonawardena joins the British Liberal Democratic Party and unsuccessfully contests a Local Government Election Seat in the Borough Council of Brent.
Bypass surgery
Eventually, Prem Coonawardena had to retire from London Underground Railway due to a heart attack, where he had to undergo Heart Bypass Surgery. At this Juncture, he decides to return to his roots in Sri Lanka and spend his twilight years in community service to help the less fortunate. In pursuance of this idea, he joins the Lions Club International at Nugegoda where he ends up as the President. When he changed his residence to Piliyandala, he got transferred to Piliyandala Lions Club. In the next chapters, he describes his travels with Lions to conventions in Hong Kong, Bangkok, Boston in the USA and Australia and in addition he gives a fascinating description on his travels to many cities in Europe and Canada and the USA.
The book written in lucid, narrative style in simple English is a good reading for youngsters to emulate the village boy who reached higher echelons in life through firm determination and indomitable courage. - Reviewed by Padmasiri de Silva

## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Long-struggled womens quota
The numbers are out. The new Local Authorities system designed to have 25% women is a resounding success.
The Local Authorities Elections Ordinance required nominations to be on two lists  List 1 for the Wards, consisting of 60% of the seats of a local authority, and List 2 for the old Proportional Representation (PR) system making up the remaining 40%. Ten percent of the ward nominations had to be of women and 50% of the whole should have been of women.
After some complex computations and neglecting some nominal numbers like overhang, the 10% women from the 60% ward-seats would have returned 6% seats for women out of the whole (if the nominees were as good as the men). And 50% seats for women out of the 40% PR seats would have yielded 20% women representatives  that is 25% women if the selections for PR seats is done justly by the political parties nominating members.
This new system, say womens groups, is the brainchild of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who agreed to what the women had been asking for, for decades.
Provincial Council elections
What do the numbers tell us Out of 5092 representatives elected to wards, women are 537  that is 10.55%. With only 10% women contesting for the ward seats, more have been elected. This means the public are not at all averse to women representatives.
And then overall, out of the total 8698 representatives (Ward+PR), there are 1991 women  making up a total of 22.89%. Although a little less than the targeted 25%, there are a few more women to come.
The Provincial Council elections are next. The legislation is ready providing for one-sixth women. I do not know why it is not a quarter as for the Local Councils -- the government had rather foolishly scaled back its ambitious and commendable programme for women without even testing the new system.
Now the new system has proved to yield the expected outcome of accommodating women. Despite this success, the Daily Mirror of 19.03.2018 reports that there is a consensus among political parties to revert to the now abolished system with all seats by PR. Minister Rauff Hakeem spoke of complications in the election to local authorities as the reason why they want to go back to the old system.
What complications Stuff and nonsense! Old men who literally controlled 98+ percent of the seats in local authorities are resentful that they now have only 75%, and that the people really voted for the women who were elected.
There is nothing wrong with the new system. After the elections, when the parties were asked by the Election Commission to nominate women for the vacant PR seats, some either did not respond, or responded partially or sent in the names of men where they ought to have sent in women. The Election Commission after waiting beyond the deadline we had imposed finally published the gazette without the names that should have been submitted, or after deleting the last of the mens names where the mens names should have been womens. For example if a party was asked by the Commission to nominate 2 men and 2 women, and instead if they had sent in 3 men and 1 woman, the third man on their list in excess did not get his name published in the gazette. We published only the first two names of the men and the womans. We did not do this arbitrarily but only after telling them that this is what we would do if they did not comply. So, even now, if they send us the missing female names, we would be happy to issue a new gazette with these supplementary names. This is why I said more female names would come in.
I understand that there is party infighting as to which men should be nominated even when men are eligible. This is why some parties have missed the deadline. In their inability to decided, they blame the Election Commission and the new system.
Success story
Like spoilt brats, politicians speak of the burden they need to carry in nominating women. What burden when the public has elected more than 10% the parties had to nominate for wards How are women a burden when they do satisfactory work as doctors, teachers and administrators, well in excess of their numbers How, when Colombo has had a stellar mayor and even female doctors elected What burden to parties when the women are the parties own nominees, and they had every opportunity to find independent women who can serve the nation and their party well
These men treated women with disrespect and carelessly nominated women just for the sake of filing nominations, women who they now think are unfit to be nominated. Serves them right I say! Boo to them!
Now that women are in place in Councils, let us make sure they have a chance to prove their mettle. We must support them, regardless of their party, and ensure that they succeed.
The Prime Minister, after the political parties made representations to go back to PR for the provincial councils, agreed to have more talks with them.
I urge Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe not to even think of any more talks. This is a success story this government can rightly boast of  where 52% of the population, our women, had their political rights recognized. Why would the Prime Minister turn his back on what is his lasting legacy to this nation

Marginalized community of tsunami victims
Fourteen years since the tsunami hit Sri Lanka, many of its victims in the South complain that they are yet to receive reprieve from the government and that many of the houses they were given have now fallen into ruin, due to poor construction and mismanagement.
The majority of these victims have now turned into a forgotten community and they state that the government only remembers them when it is election time. And for the last 14 years they have been forgotten by the politician as well as the government servant once the election cycle is done and dusted.
These victims recently expressed their disappointment over the construction of houses given to them after having lived in temporary shelters for several years, undergoing numerous hardships, since that fateful day.
Houses abandoned
Most of these housing schemes are located in Kosgoda, Ahungalla, Balapitiya, Godagama, Telwatte, Galagodawatte, Ratgama, Gonapinuwala and Walahanduwa in the Galle district and in Midigama in the Matara district.
In addition, the Hambantota district had the Hangama tsunami housing complex also known as the Hangama  Sri Lankan Friendship Village donated by the people of Hungary. This has been abandoned by the recipients as they proved to be unsuitable for human habitation. Further, these were built on land belonging to the government. As the people have left, certain houses have been given to the families of the police. Prior to that, tiles, timber, door and window frames had been stolen. The people pointed out that this was a waste of foreign funds, and the relevant authorities had not taken any action to monitor the building materials purchased to construct these 100 houses.
The government at the time had specified that a minimum sum of Rs. 500,000 would need to be spent on the construction of a single house. The Hungarian  Sri Lanka Friendship Association however had spent only Rs. 200,000 per house. Their plan had been to increase the number of houses by cutting down on the cost of a single house, revealed a former resident.
This is not the first tsunami housing scheme to be abandoned.
A few years ago, a foundation-laying ceremony was held for one of the largest tsunami housing schemes at Ratgama, known as the Galagodawatte Tsunami Housing Scheme in the Galle district. These houses were donated by the Dharma Foundation in the United States. Many US citizens, including famous Hollywood artistes, had donated funds for it. It was reported at the time that even the prisoners had donated funds for the Galagodawatte Tsunami Housing Scheme.
A consultant attached to the Urban Development Ministry accompanied the writer, during the construction phase of the housing scheme, to make a surprise visit to several housing schemes including the one at Galagodawatte. On that day, he witnessed shallow trenches being cut for laying foundations and he immediately stopped it and a representative of the contracting company tried to give numerous explanations with regard to what they were doing.
Several years later, the occupants of these houses complain of the inferior timber used in the houses. Roofs of many of the houses have collapsed, but neither the Divisional Secretariat nor any other relevant authority has intervened to resolve these problems.
The shallow toilet pits constructed using small cylinders are already full. Further, the walls of many of the houses are seen to be cracking. The roofs are leaking, and the houses in low-lying areas have been submerged due to rains, as no proper drainage system was found.
The residents complained that many of the sub-contractors handling the project had employed inexperienced masons and carpenters for lower wages than usual in order to gain a higher profit.
Over 50 residents have left these houses at Galagodawatte, and these houses are now covered by shrub jungle.
Due to lack of coordination in the distribution of houses, there were also many instances where one family had obtained around three houses from the NGO.
Recently, the remaining occupants had informed the Galle District Secretariat about the condition of the toilets of Godagama Tsunami Housing Scheme and requested that they send a gully bowser to clean it. Their request was transferred to the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat for necessary action. But the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat is yet to heed their request and resolve the issue.
Godagama was one the coastal villages in the Galle district to be among the worst affected by the tsunami and is in close proximity to Peraliya, where the largest train accident during the tsunami took place.
Container houses
The Spanish government which came forward to help those affected in the tsunami had decided to supply many victims with container houses. At the beginning, there were 20 container houses at Godagama. It was however reported that more than 100 such container houses have been dumped in a container yard at Peliyagoda. During the handing over of these container houses at the time, a representative of Spain had revealed that each of those houses cost around Rs. 300,000.
For nearly six months since these houses arrived in Galle, they had not been handed over to the people in the area who were affected. Finally the villagers broke open the container houses to occupy them. Although the container houses reached Sri Lanka with numerous household items including, air conditioning units, the villagers complained that they received nothing. It was just a container, with no house, they stated. The occupants of the container houses eventually dismantled the containers and started to sell them off as scrap iron.
Sirikandura Tsunami Housing Scheme
The Sirikandura Tsunami Housing Scheme is yet another unsuccessful housing project found at Ratgama. An organization called NEXT donated 165 houses to victims of the tsunami. In the construction of these houses, certain newly invented material had been used. The prefabricated concrete made of a plastic net had been used to build the houses. Many of these houses collapsed in a few months causing health hazards to the occupants. Young children suffered from skin ailments due to the cement dust, and some the recipients left this housing scheme. Chief Incumbent of the Vijayarama Temple in Ratgama, Ven. Dodanduwe Wimalarathana said at the moment 100 houses were occupied, whilst 50 houses were abandoned.
These houses are located on the Sirikandura coconut estate, but the occupants who were engaged in fishing as their livelihood used to live on the beachfront before the tsunami. They had found it extremely difficult to continue their livelihood as the tsunami housing scheme was located too far away from the sea.
The majority of those displaced by the tsunami today live below the poverty line and many families find it difficult to make a daily living.
Daluwathumulla is a suburban village of Hikkaduwa where the tsunami affected have been provided with houses donated by numerous NGOs, both local and foreign. The tsunami brought in a flood of NGOs eager to build houses for those affected, and they were all in a haste to construct these houses. K.D.W. Dharmadasa and K.G. Jayantha of Godagama revealed that almost all the tsunami houses by now are severely dilapidated. None of those NGOs are in existence now.
They say that the Hikkaduwa Divisional Secretariat did not pay attention to their grievances because these houses were constructed by NGOs.

Minister vows to release previous regimes abductions list
Four computerized pages of abductions that occurred during the previous regime have been reported and the list will be declared soon, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after laying the foundation stone for the proposed Accident and Emergency Treatment Unit at the Kegalle hospital, to be constructed at a cost of Rs. 3,700 million.
He said no abductions have taken place under this government. During the previous regime, abductions, murders, etc. had taken place.
According to Minister Senaratne, a medical ward complex for cardiology will be constructed at the Kegalle hospital at a cost of Rs. 250 million. He added that prices at private hospitals will be regulated in another two weeks.
The government faced various obstacles when the price of 48 drugs was slashed offering a great relief to the public. Likewise, the prices at private hospitals will be regulated, he said.
One private hospital had charged Rs. 2.3 million for a heart surgery and the patient had died. The heart surgeon had not taken his fee, he added. There are compassionate doctors like him, the minister added.
Several politicians and officials were present on the occasion.

NCE welcomes enactment of legislation on antidumping
The National Chamber of Exporters (NCE) has welcomed the much-awaited Antidumping, Countervailingand Safeguard Measures Acts which were passed in parliament on 7th of March. The enactment of these two acts were long over due in the case of Sri Lanka since over 30 countries both developed and developing including India, Pakistan and Bangladesh which are competitors of Sri Lanka related to international trade in the south Asian region had already enacted such domestic legislation.
The chamber is particularly pleased with the enactment of this legislation since local industry has been making representations in the past that imports are entering the country in some instances at lower prices than the normal value.
In this context with the implementation of the trade liberalization policies of the Government, and particularly the ongoing negotiations of the government to enter into Free Trade Agreements and Economic PartnershipAgreements with several countries including large economies such as China and India and also with Thailand, Malaysia and Bangladesh, which are in the pipe line, local entrepreneurs have been particularly concerned regarding possible surges in imports which could cause damage to local enterprises; in addition to the Free Trade Agreements that have been already signed with India, Pakistan, and Singapore.
The enactment of this legislation will provide safe guards to local enterprises in regard to imported products which are deliberately priced below their normal value, and some times below the cost of production of the exporting countries, to drive out competition from local enterprises which produce the same or similar products.
Similarly, the legislation provides safeguards to local enterprises in respect of imported products which have received excessive and unfair subsidies in the producing country, which are actionable under the legislation. Further the Safeguard Measures Act provides for the protection of domestic enterprises from sudden surges in imports which could cause injury to domestic enterprises
However as stated in a press release of the Ministry of Strategy Development and International Trade these new laws are not aimed at providing blanket protectionism to domestic industry, but rather a credible set of remedial measures in the event of injury cause to domestic industry. Therefore, their primary purpose is to ensure fair competition and to provide domestic industry a level playing field
As stated by the Ministry, the chamber is conscious of the fact that dumping is often mistaken to mean cheap or low-priced imports. In this context mere complaints by local enterprises that goods are imported at low prices will not be sufficient to provide remedial measures through the levy of anti-dumping duties, but should be done through a laid down procedure where applications should be submitted by the attracted industries for initiation of investigations, and for the imposition of anti-dumping duty or to provide other remedial measures.
For this purpose, the Chamber notes that the investigating authority has been vested with the Director General of Commerce, to whom application has to been made by the affected domestic enterprises, following a laid down procedure.
Thereafter the Director General of Commerce is required to investigate and determine the injury if any that is caused to affected local enterprises within a stipulated time frame, and recommend action for the imposition of additional or countervailing duties for which authority is vested with the Ministry of Finance
In order to made the implementation process of the enacted legislation productive and beneficial to local enterprises, while conforming to international trading practices, the chamber is of the view that domestic industry and entrepreneurs, especially those engaged in SMEs, should be educated on the assessment of any damage to local enterprises by collating accurate information, and thereafter make application to the responsible state Authority who is the Director General of Commerce, following proper procedure.
For this purpose the chamber suggests the conduct of suitable Forums or Workshops to educate local entrepreneurs, or in the alternative conduct aTrainers Training Workshop for representatives of the relevant Trade Chambers and other organizations, to enable them to suitably advice and educate member companies to facilitate the provision of relief measures.

Non-academic staff grievances to be solved before April

State Minster of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero said today that the government is putting its best effort to resolve the grievances of university non-academic staff before April.
He said this in Parliament, today.
Grero further said that the issue was discussed again today at a meeting held with the General Treasury in order to bring about a swift solution.
Pointing out that the non-academic staff has not received their salaries for this month and they will also not receive their bonus payments for the New Year eve, JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa warned that if the government fails to provide a viable solution soon they will continue to strike.
Pathirana questioned as to why the agreement on monthly salary allowances between the non-academic staff, the University Grant Commission and the Higher Education Ministry is not implemented.
Grero in response said, We came upon this agreement in 2016. The agreement only indicated that the government will try its best to solve this issue. It said that we will attempt to pay 75percent of the monthly salary within a period of five years to solve the monthly salary issue they are facing. Even though all the above mentioned institutes have agreed to this solution, the General Treasury is still is not in favor of this agreement.

Non-declaration of assets: Fine to be increased to Rs 100,000
A minimum of Rs 100,000 fine has been proposed to the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act for non declaration of assets and liabilities. The current penalty for such offence is Rs 1,000.
Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC said far reaching amendments have been proposed to the current law of assets declaration which was last revised in 1988.
He said providing false information in the declaration form would also be an offence. He said proposed amendments are being considered by the Legal Draftsman and a preliminary draft would be made with wide consultation of local and international experts.
He said proposals have been made to widen the area covered from the asset declaration form to include loans, intellectual property, insurance, payments made for electricity and telephone bills, gifts one has received, bonus, travel sponsored by various agencies, various memberships in organisations and clubs. These vital areas have been left out by the current law.
Those are various methods of acquiring income and assets, he pointed out.
He said the proposal has been made to make a summary of asset declaration available to the public without giving personal information or family details. The lump sum of money in the bank accounts and ones land and property (without giving the specific area) will be available for public perusal.
These include property in other countries as well, he added.
UN Office on Drugs and Crime brought experts from Indonesia and Slovenia while World Bank also sent their experts.
Our specialist from the Inland Revenue Department, Customs, Financial Intelligence Unit of the Central Bank, Public Administration Ministry, Attorney Generals Department and Elections Commission too attended these meetings, he said.
The category of people who should submit assets declaration will be widened to include even the provincial councillors.
The Election Commission has proposed to make it mandatory for candidates of elections to submit their assets declaration form within two weeks of nomination.
As of now they have to submit within three months and the elections are over by then, he explained.
The DG said provisions will be made shortly to submit the asset declaration forms online.
Then when you submit the form once, you will only have to update it thereafter.
At the moment there are many agencies dealing with collection of assets declaration forms. There was a suggestion to make the CIABOC the central authority to collect, evaluate and analyse those forms.
For that we will have to digitise the system, he noted.
The DG however reminded the proposed amendments have to be passed in Parliament without dilution in order to see their objectives being realised.

Only socialism can save China - Xi
CHINA: Chinese President Xi Jinping reasserted the Communist Partys supremacy over his country on Tuesday, telling the nations Parliament that only socialism can save China as it pursues development.
History has already proven and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China, Xi said, adding later that the Communist Party is the supreme political leadership of the country and the fundamental guarantee to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
The Chinese President delivering a blistering nationalist speech on Tuesday, warning against any attempts to split China and touting the countrys readiness to fight the bloody battle to regain its rightful place in the world.
Xis address capped an annual session of the National Peoples Congress that paved the way for him to rule for life, as Chinas most powerful leader since Mao Zedong pushes through his vision of guiding the country through a new era of unrivalled global military and economic supremacy.
Days after President Donald Trump signed new rules allowing top-level US officials to travel to Taiwan, Xi warned that Beijing would defend its one China principle, which sees the self-ruling island as its territory awaiting reunification. All acts and tricks to separate the country are doomed to fail and will be condemned by the people and punished by history, Xi told nearly 3,000 delegates assembled at the imposing Great Hall of the People facing Tiananmen Square.
But he also sought to address concerns about ambitious Chinese development projects abroad, saying they will not pose a threat to any country. Only those who are accustomed to threatening others will see everyone as a threat, he added in an address that drew waves of applause from the legislators.
China is overseeing a massive global trade infrastructure initiative to revive the ancient Silk Road, drawing interest from nations participating in the investment but also criticism from others fearing that it mainly serves Beijings interests.
The Chinese leaders plan to build a world-class military by mid-century has also raised concerns about how it plans to use its increasingly modern forces amid regional frictions over Chinas territorial claims in the South China Sea.
Xi used the speech to espouse his vision of realising the rejuvenation of the Chinese nation -- the greatest dream of the worlds second-largest economy.
The Chinese people have been indomitable and persistent, we have the spirit of fighting the bloody battle against our enemies to the bitter end, he said.
But his speech was also a reminder that the Communist Party, more than ever, reigns over the countrys affairs.
History has already proven and will continue to prove that only socialism can save China, he said.
The Communist Party is the supreme political leadership of the country and the fundamental guarantee to achieve the great rejuvenation of the Chinese nation.
The two-week session of the National Peoples Congress handed Xi, 64, a second term and endorsed the Communist Partys decision to lift presidential term limits, clearing the way for him to remain in power indefinitely after his new term ends in 2023.
His eponymous political philosophy, which was enshrined in the party charter last year, was added to the national constitution and senior government officials had to swear an oath to the document for the first time.
Some of Xis key lieutenants were also promoted to top positions. His former anti-corruption czar, Wang Qishan, was elevated to the vice presidency while his top economic adviser, Liu He, became vice premier. - AFP

However, students were able to develop amazing animations using their imagination, creativity and computing.
Skills and knowledge are the driving forces of economic growth and social development for any country. I am so glad to see the level of interest shown by these young minds, saidformer Sri Lanka cricket captain, Mahela Jayawardena.Eventslike these help generate Sri Lankan students interest in the field of Computer Science, provide them an opportunity to code in a collaborative environment, and equip them with the IT skills they need to compete in tomorrows job market.
In addition to learning how to code, students had the chance to hear from a number of speakers at the eventOracle partners, Oracle Academy members and guest speakerswho shared their experiences with participants on pursuing a career in the technology field and becoming a future leader of Sri Lanka.

The Parents Union of State Medical Students demands that President Maithripala Sirisena recall the Cabinet paper regarding the KDU (SAITM) MBBS immediately, the Union's spokesman Wasantha Alwis said.
Addressing a press conference held at the Organization of Professional Associations (OPA) in Colombo yesterday, he said that no one had agreed to offer SAITM students a KDU (SAITM) MBBS and all had agreed to offer them the KDU MBBS, which is recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). Therefore the President should do what the majority of SAITM students, their parents, the GMOA and many others demand, and not what was demanded by 101 unqualified students and their rich parents.
According to Alwis, the SLMC does not recognize SAITM or a new MBBS named KDU (SAITM). State medical students will take to the streets again and fight until even few of them die if someone is trying to make 40 students with Ordinary Level qualifications and 28 students with three simple passes at the Advanced Level examination (3S), KDU (SAITM) MBBS doctors. Parents cannot stop their well-qualified state medical students coming to the streets again to fight against this injustice.

Both Commission reports to be taken for debate after PRECIFAC report is translated
The Secretary to the President has informed Parliament that approximately a month's time would be taken to translate and submit the PRECIFAC report, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said yesterday.
MP Wimal Weerawansa, raising a point of order, questioned as to when the debate on the reports of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue and the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC) would be taking place.
The first debate on the two reports was held on February 6, 2018. At the second day of the debate which was scheduled for February 20, 2018, it was postponed as TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran pointed out that they were not able to participate in the debate as the PRECIFAC report was in Sinhala. The reports were then forwarded to the Official Languages Department for translation.
In reply, Speaker Jayasuriya said the second day of the debate was still fixed for Friday (23), however, translations on both the reports were yet to be completed by the Official Languages Department. He pointed out that if both reports were in English, they could have held the debate. In response, MP Weerawansa asked if it was possible to hold the debate on the Treasury bond issue as the Commissions report was available in English. Since we already have the Treasury Bond Commission report, could we not take it for debate until a translated copy of the PRECIFAC report was submitted he questioned. In reply, Speaker Jayasuriya informed that a decision had been taken at the Party Leaders meeting to take both commission reports together for debate.
Speaking on the same matter, JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake requested the Speaker to expedite the translation process, as both reports were mandatory for the debate.
It is not fair to request for the the report to be taken which addresses their fraud and corruption later and to take the report which investigates into others corruption first. We need both these reports for the debate as soon as possible, MP Ratnayake pointed out. He requested the Speaker not to solely rely on the Official Languages Department on the translations of these two reports and requested the possibility of deploying Parliamentary staff to expedite the translation process.
Meanwhile MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara speaking on the same topic, said it would take a longer time if the Parliament was to wait until the Official Languages Department completed the translations of these two reports. As I have once been the subject Minister for this department and the ministry, I am very much aware of the capacity of this institute. Thus, you might want to rely on another source as well, if you really wanted to receive the translated copies soon.
MP Nanayakkara made requested to avoid the use of the issue on translations as a scapegoat to delay the debate on the two reports.
New Standing Orders to come into effect from April 15:Speaker
The attendance of the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister to reply to questions raised during the oral question round in Parliament would be mandatory from April 15, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said.
The Speaker made this observation when UNP's backbench MP Ashoka Priyantha, complained that the relevant ministers were often absent when they raise questions and which deprives them of the chance to get proper answers to the supplementary questions they raise.
The Speaker said according to the new Standing Orders adopted by the House early this month, the relevant Minister or Deputy Minister should be present to answer questions. The Speaker said that he had directed the attention of both the President and Prime Minister in this regard.
The new Standing Orders would come into effect from April 15.
Govt. members demand separate high court to expedite large corruption, fraud
The Government members in one voice insisted in Parliament yesterday, to set up a separate high court to expedite high profile cases on allegations of financial crimes and large scale corruption and fraud.
When the House took up several regulations and rules moved by Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Government MPs who took the floor stood firm that the offenders who swindled public money must be tried before Courts of Law without further delay.
They reminded that the punishing of rogues and taking a hard-line on corruption and fraud, was a key election pledge of the Yahapalana Government. They emphasized that the Government should not back peddle on this pledge at any cost.
Deputy Ministers Karunarathna Paranavithana and Ranjan Ramanayake and UNP backbench MPs Sujith Sanjaya Perera, Ashoka Priyantha and Ajith Mannapperuma, called on the Government to expedite the high profile cases on corruption and fraud by going ahead with the proposal to set up a separate high court.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath and UPFA MP Douglas Devananda, too, threw in their weight behind the plea. None of the members from the SLFP took part in the debate yesterday.
Punishing those involved in financial crimes and large scale corruption and fraud was an urgent matter of national importance in the country today. The seriousness of some of those cases had rocked the entire country. We are unable to move an inch forward without prosecuting those involved in such cases. Large scale corruption and fraud are a cancer that should be dealt with, Paranavithana said.
Reminding that justice delayed is justice denied, the Deputy Minister pointed out that the Executive, Legislature and Judiciary have a special role to play in meting out justice with regard to high profile cases which had come to light recently.
He pointed out that those who spoke against the move of setting up a separate court, exposed their allegiances with the wrong doers. We need a revival of the judiciary, while a separate court is the first step in that direction. We also need a new political culture that respects the tenets of good governance, he added.
JVP MP Vijitha Herath pointed out that the Government had failed to prosecute the rogues for three long years, due to its deals with the accused party. He said nobody should be afraid of setting up a separate court if they are not guilty of wrong doing. Go before that court and clear your name if you are not guilty, he told those, objecting to the Judicature Amendment Bill.
He also accused that President Maithripala Sirisenas entourage during his recent visit to Japan included an individual accused of murder and another accused of financial fraud.
The allegiance of these persons, speaks as to why they had gone scot free despite the serious allegations against them. On the other hand, the Prime Minister was also accused of making deals with the offenders, he added.
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa queries as to how SAITM appears to be on sale
JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa, referring to a newspaper advertisement, questioned yesterday, as to how the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital which was officially handed over to the Government, appears to be on sale. Jayatissa further questioned if the government had actually acquired the Neville Fernando Teaching Hospital and how SAITM advertises the selling of the hospital.
JVP MP Jayatissa also pointed out that the government was paying Rs. 300 million per month at present, for the same hospital which was taken over in August.
Jayatissa did not receive an answer from State Minister of Higher Education Mohan Lal Grero who was to respond to the question. Minister Grero stated that the initial question raised by Jayatissa was not related to the SAITM issue, but on the Advanced Level examination results and the minimum cut off marks for Government Medical Institutions.
Jayatissa who forwarded a series of questions to Grero, asked if it was fair to make the minimum cut off grades for Government Medical Institutions be at a high standard, whereas private medical institutions were allowed to enroll students at a lower grade level. A student in Hambantota, also need two A grades and a B to enter the Government Medical Faculty. So isnt it unfair for them, when SAITM takes in students for two C grades and a pass Jayatissa initially questioned.
Minister Grero, refusing Jayatissas argument, stated that the present structured education system in the country does not correctly measure the intelligence of students.
He pointed out that A/L results have become an accepted criterion, only because there was no other option. The results recorded by a student in grade five scholarship examination, O/L or A/L examination, does not evaluate which profession that particular student should master in, he added. Accordingly, Grero said that a student with three A passes would not be as qualified as a student who had scored lesser grades, but has better interpersonal intelligence.
Countering Grero, Jayatissa said that even Parliament has the level of education as a criterion when recruiting persons providing gardening services at the Parliament. In any profession, there is a required education level. There could be such concepts about methods to measure a persons intelligence, but a criterion on education level is still important. Jayatissa pointed out.
CB bond issue too could be heard at proposed special courts
The case pertaining to the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issuance could also be heard at the proposed special courts, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala said in Parliament yesterday.
She made these observations in reply to JVP MP Vijitha Herath who proposed to take up the case on the Central Bank bonds issue as the first in one of the three proposed high courts to expedite cases on large scale corruption and fraud. She said the sole objective of the proposal to set up separate courts, was to punish the wrong doers, adding that it was not an attempt of a political witch-hunt. She said her Ministry is awaiting the Supreme Court's opinion, adding that future steps on the separate court would be based on the Supreme Court ruling.
Private Institution owes SLRD Rs. 9.78 million:Dy Minister
Sri Lanka Railways Department is yet to receive Rs. 9.78 million from a private institution for granting railway carriages for renovation and attachment to trains to offer luxury services to tourists, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said in Parliament yesterday.
The Deputy Minister was responding to a question raised by UNP MP Lucky Jayawardena.
Jayawardana queried as to whether all dues have been obtained from private institutions to which these carriages were granted by the Railway Department.
Deputy Minister Abeysinghe said an sum of Rs. 9.78 million had to be obtained from a private institution called JF Tours and Travels.
JF Tours agreement with the SLRD expires in 2021. Therefore, the SLRD has decided to obtain the due amount in four instalments per year.
An instalment would be Rs. 500,000 minimum. We have to get the approval from the Secretary to the Treasury for this proposal and a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) should be signed with the company. We will obtain the due amount in full before the agreement expires, Abeysinghe said.
The Deputy Minister however, noted that this was not a loss to the SLRD, but an additional income.
These were used carriages and the department receives an additional income by granting them to private institutions, he said.

Secretary to the Police Commission Ariyadasa Cooray, had been notified officially yesterday, that he was removed from his post.
Cooray had said that the Commission informed him that he had been removed from the post as he was overage.
He said that based on a decision taken by the Police Commission, it was decided to remove Cooray from his post as his term had been expired. The Commission would take measures to appoint a new Secretary to the Police Commission shortly. This had been discussed by the Commission members and it is expected that the new appointment would take place during this week, according to internal sources.
When contacted, Ariyadasa Cooray said that he had been informed that he was being removed due to his age factor and that he would accept the Commissions decision. He noted that his contract period had also ended and as such, he would accept this decision.
However, it so happens that the members of the Police Commission are all retired personnel.
Meanwhile, CAFFE and the Human Rights Centre issuing a statement, said the reasons that the Police Commission Secretary Ariyadasa Cooray, who was recruited on a contract basis, was removed because he had called for a report from the IGP regarding the conduct of the Police in the recent Digana and Theldeniya clashes.
The statement further noted that Cooray was being removed from this position as he had called for an independent investigation into the Theldeniya clashes and this move was to prevent that investigation, which drew unfavourable reactions from several prominent politicians.

Policy blunder causes govt Rs 3 bn tobacco revenue
The tax revenue from Tobacco to the government coffers have dropped by Rs 3 billion and this is expect to continue, said Founder Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) Roshan Madawela.
Speaking at a Research Forum organised by RIU he said that the government targeted Rs 105 billion of tax revenue from Tobacco.
Madawela said that today tax on Tobacco and other overheads has resulted in the increase of a cigarette price by 257%.
With Sri Lanka currently having the highest cigarette prices in the Asia Pacific region (PPP) and the second highest prices in the world, the island is also rapidly turning into a smugglers paradise, he added.
Taking Malaysia as example he said that the production cost increased by 111% in 5 years which resulted in a huge drop of revenue to the government and it also saw a big sale of illegal cigarettes. There was a similar situation in Pakistan and to overcome this issue a lower priced cigarette was introduced. It was also disclosed that the value of Sri Lanka Tobacco industry was Rs 131.7 billion which is 1% of GDP. There are 46,000 employees while there are 20,000 Tobacco farmers.
These people say that the proposed tobacco ban showed be differed by another 10 years enabling these people to adjust to another mode of income generation. A countrys fiscal and taxation policy is a major determinant of macro-economic policy and sustainable economic growth particularly in areas such as government revenue, public debt as well as resource allocation and economic stability. The critical thrust of any Government policy on tobacco should be a focus on achieving two important objectives.
According to Sri Lanka Customs, only one out of 10 smuggled cigarettes are discovered and confiscated by law enforcement agencies.
The international agencies, including the World Bank, have suggested that a 10 percent rise in taxes will result in an 8% fall in smoking in low and middle-income countries.
Economist, Lalinda Sugathadasa said that government must look at alternative methods for revenue generation since there is a drastic drop from Tobacco tax revenue.

Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said the President can and will solve the national question.
Addressing a gathering at his alma mater St. Patricks College in Jaffna in the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena called on the president to offer a solution to the national question, a mandate upon which the Tamil people had voted him into power for.
We want a statesman who can rise up and bring an amicable solution within the context of a united, indivisible and undivided country for the sake of amity between its people, he said. You must overcome whatever impediments that stands in your way to become that statesman who resolved the national issue.
The country cannot go on like this, it has bled enough, he told a gathering.
If all citizens of this country want to live peacefully together, we need to solve the national question. President, we know you can do it, we know that you want to do it.
The Opposition Leader referred to the Presidents efforts to solve the national question, stating that the Tamil people were aware of his efforts as well the impediments that stand in his way.
Sampanthan tracing Sri Lanka fraught history battling colonial powers cited that it when the 1972 Constitution failed to accommodate the minimum demands put forward by the Tamil people, that these marginalized citizens began their demand for separation, after which the separatist war ensued.
I make this request to you in Jaffna and at my school, St. Patricks College, to bring about a lasting solution to the national question. A mandate upon which the Tamil people voted you into power for and gave you unstinted support.
The Opposition Leader also called on the diaspora to invest in Sri Lanka, in particular small and medium enterprises that are wholly Sri Lankan. Invest in your country, support small and medium scale enterprises that are trying to make it big, not just in the North and East but throughout the country.

Rabada cleared for Aussie Tests after shoulder barge appeal
Cape Town: South Africa's Kagiso Rabada was cleared to play the remaining two Tests against Australia after winning an appeal against his ban over an alleged shoulder barge on Tuesday.
The International Cricket Council said Rabada had been found not guilty of making inappropriate and deliberate physical contact with Australian captain Steve Smith during the second Test in Port Elizabeth last week.
Judicial commissioner Michael Heron of New Zealand found Rabada guilty of the lesser charge of conduct contrary to the spirit of the game following an appeal hearing on Monday.
Heron reduced Rabada's penalty from three demerit points to one, and reduced his fine from 50 percent to 25 percent of his match fee.
Rabada's total of demerit points was therefore reduced from nine to seven, one short of the threshold for an automatic two-Test ban.
The ICC announcement said Rabada was free to play - which means he will take his place in the South African team for the third Test against Australia starting at Newlands on Thursday.
But Rabada's cumulative points tally means that any further disciplinary action could result in a ban.
Heron said the key issue was whether Rabada made deliberate contact with Smith.
"I am not 'comfortably satisfied' that Mr. Rabada intended to make contact," Heron said in an ICC statement.

The new amendment enables the government to have complete control over DeathDonation Societies and Mutualaid societies in villages. The statement further states that the existing laws are sufficient to control these institutions and the enactment of more laws will simply take away the existing freedom of Voluntary Social Service Organisations.
This type of new institutions will only benefit the henchmen of politicians whose expenses will be paid from public funds.

As a No-Confidence Motion looms over the Prime Minister in Parliament, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka had submitted a Cabinet Paper highlighting the way forward for the government.
The last Cabinet Paper, the 59th paper was a political one, said National Co-existence Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan speaking to the Daily News.
Minister Ranawaka having presented the paper had insisted that structural changes needed to be made if they were to survive the next few years.
He said he was answerable to his supporters and party and that if no changes were made, he would be compelled to make his own decision, Minister Ganesan said.
Minister Rajitha Senaratne who had then echoed the sentiments expressed by Ranawaka had also appealed to the President and Prime Minister to come to terms to work together.
As a partner in the national government, Minister Ganesan was also quick to agree that the two main leaders needed to speak in one voice and make the needed structural changes.
A proper Cabinet reshuffle is needed and it should mean that talented people; those who were responsible for bringing the government into power and those who can work should be given more responsibility. And the Yes men and women should be demoted or removed, said the minister.
We want them to give priority to the good governance government. This is not happening, both are working in the interests of their own political party, he added.

The Shakib episode and its consequences
The smooth functioning of the Hero Nidahas tri-nation T20 series was sullied by an incident involving Bangladesh captain Shakib Al Hasan which to say the least was outrageous and left a black mark on Bangladeshs cricket internationally.
A captain or a coach getting upset at an umpiring decision is not new in cricket or sports in general but one cannot recall an instance of a captain calling his players off because of his disagreement with the umpires decision.
This said state of affairs took place in the final league match between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium on Friday that ended in a nail-biting finish with Bangladesh winning by two wickets off the penultimate ball to qualify for the final with India.
What Shakib did was not a reaction to being triggered by the opposition it was purely a protest against the umpires who failed to call the second of two successive bouncers delivered at over shoulder height a wide. It was quite normal for the Bangladeshi batsmen in the middle and for Shakib to lose his cool at that point as the match was delicately poised and one wrong call could have changed the course of the match.
But what was totally shocking was when Shakib gestured towards his batsmen to leave the ground. Although Shakib denied at the post-media conference that he was trying to get his men off the field it was all there for everyone to see him actually repeating it four or five times. If it was a weak batsman out there in the middle who had responded to his call his action would have turned out to be an absolute embarrassment for all the stakeholders concerned including Bangladesh themselves who could have conceded the match to Sri Lanka. But saner counsel prevailed and Mahmudullah did not respond to his captains crazy call and not only did he turn his own back on him but told Rubel Hossain his partner not to go off in what was a rare display of sanity during those few minutes of chaos. Mahmudullah then went onto score the required 12 runs - all off his own bat off the next three balls to provide one of the most extraordinary finishes to a T20I and put his team in the final.
Although it all ended well for Bangladesh the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB) must not sweep this incident involving Shakib under the carpet but must introspect ask themselves whether Shakib is the right man to lead their team in the future. Until he arrived and took over the captaincy from Mahmudullah, the Bangladesh team was at their best behavior.
However a great cricketer Shakib might be for him to get carried away by such an incident forgetting his responsibilities as captain is dangerous especially when he is in charge of the team. A leader cant be a quitter as Shakib clearly made it out to be. Probably he had in his mind that his team had no chance of winning the game and thats why he tried to call the off on the pretext of the umpiring decision.
His action also raises the question that he has no faith in his team and he was not backing the specialist batsman out there to get the job done and then almost dictate his decision of quitting the team raises serious question marks over his leadership qualities. BCB must ask the question whether they should allow a man of his level of patience to continue as captain especially in a fiercely competitive environment.
Bangladesh became a cricketing force in the past three years because of the discipline that was brought into the team by their former head coach Chandika Hathurusingha. A no-nonsense coach the first thing that Hathurusingha did as soon as he took over in June 2014 was getting the BCB to suspend Shakib from all cricket for six months. Shakib was not even granted an NOC to play in overseas competitions until the end of 2015.
The BCB stated that the punishment was handed out because of Shakibs serious misbehavior with coach Hathurusingha and for his altercation with a spectator during an ODI against India at Mirpur.
The president of the BCB at the time Nazmul Hassan said, He (Shakib) has a severe attitude problem, which is unprecedented in the history of Bangladesh cricket. We think that his behaviour is such that it's directly impacting the team. What is perhaps more alarming is that other players have started to behave like him [Shakib]. If this continues, our future will be destroyed. So that's why we believe he deserves a strict punishment. Our board has unanimously decided to ban him from competitive cricket for the next six months, both national and international cricket. Also till December 31, 2015, he won't receive any NOCs for foreign tournaments and his current NOCs have been withdrawn.
Hathurusingha is no longer with Bangladesh cricket and if the BCB does not address the Shakib incident that took place in Colombo seriously their cricket is bound to go on a downward curve.
The BCB should not let Shakib get away as the ICC did. ICC match referee Chris Broads decision to hand out only minor sanctions to Shakib  one demerit point and losing 25 percent of his match fee was like a slap on the wrist and brought the ICC under heavy criticism for the inconsistent way that fines and penalties are handed out especially against South African fast bowler Kagiso Rabada who was recently imposed a two-match ban for an offence that is seen as one of a much lesser violation than what Shakib did.
Indian cricket commentator Harsha Bogle tweeted, Getting one demerit point and losing 25% of the match fee for what happened yesterday (Friday), is like getting a pat on the back.
After many years of hardship Bangladesh cricket is on the ascedency and for them to improve further the BCB has a responsible role to play.

Special Determination petitions challenging constitutionality of Judicature (Amendment) Bill
Specialized courts can promote greater efficiency - Presidents Counsel Weliamuna
Making his oral submissions regarding the proposed amendments to the Judicature Act, Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna informed the Supreme Court yesterday that specialized courts can promote greater efficiency, often through streamlined procedures as well as higher quality and more consistent decisions in complex areas of law.
Weliamuna appearing on behalf of Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera,a intervention petitioner made this remarks when the hearing pertaining to seven Special Determination petitions challenging the constitutionality of the bill entitled the Judicature (Amendment), a Bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 were taken up before a Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasad Dep, Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare and Justice Nalin Perera.
He further said most common rationale for the creation of specialized anti-corruption courts is the desire to increase the efficiency with which the judicial system resolves corruption cases.
Some Court delays are intentional strategies. The public demand is to expedite trials in courts. A golden opportunity has arrived to rectify these issues. The litigations must be conducted not for the convenient of lawyers but for the convenient of the parties, Mr. Weliamuna added.
Presidents Counsel Dr.Jayampathi Wickremaratne informed court that the proposed permanent Trial-at-Bar is to be established within the provisions relating to the current High Courts.
He further said this bill was introduced after extensive deliberations before the Sectoral Oversight Committee on Legal Affairs and Media of Parliament consisting of representatives of all political parties represented in Parliament.
He said this committee submitted a report on recommendations pertaining to the expeditious and efficient administration of criminal justice on September 20,2017 which made a specific recommendation to introduce by law new permanent anti-corruption High Courts to hold day to day trials.
He further said a representative of the Sri Lanka Bar Association did not raise any objection regarding the establishment of such court structure before the said committee.
Saliya Peiris PC appearing on behalf of Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya told that judges for these courts are to be appointed by the Judicial Service Commission (JSC) among the existing judges of High Courts of Sri Lanka. He further said these judges are to be nominated by JSC head by Chief Justice.
Seven Special Determination petitions challenging the constitutionality of the bill entitled the Judicature (Amendment), a bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 were yesterday fixed for further argument on March 22 by the Supreme Court.
Seven Special Determination petitions had been filed by Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Chairman G.L.Peiris, Joint Opposition leader Dinesh Gunawardene, BASL President U.R. de Silva and four others. They stated that the concerned bill would vest in the executive with arbitrary powers to decide as to whom to be tried before the proposed High Court and thereby deprive the citizens of equal application of the Criminal Procedure, which is essential for the upholding of the Rule of Law.
In their intervention petitions Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva, State Minister Eran Wickramaratne, Deputy Minister Karunaratne Paranavitharana, State Minister Ajith P. Perera, Prof. Sarath Wijesuriya, Saman Rathnapriya, Jayadeva Uyangoda, Attorney-at-Law K.W. Janaranjana, Gamini Viyangoda and Jagath Premachandra sought the Courts intervention to make their submissions.
They also sought a declaration that the bill shall not become law through a two-thirds majority in Parliament and the approval of the people at a referendum.
The intervention petitioners further said the clauses of the said bill are not in violation of and inconsistent with Articles 3, 4(a), (b) (c), 12(1), 12(2), 13(3),14, 14(1)(g) 27, 75, 83 and 84(2) and the other Articles of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva, Gamini Marapana PC, Sanjeewa Jayawardena PC, Manohara de Silva PC, Kushan de Alwis PC and senior counsel Kanishka Vitharana appeared on behalf of the petitioners.
Presidents Counsel J.C. Weliamuna, Dr.Jayampathi Wickremaratne PC, Geoffrey Alagaratnam PC, Saliya Peiris PC, senior counsel Viran Corea, counsel Suren Fernando and counsel Pulasthi Hewamanne appeared for the intervention petitioners.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda PC with Additional Solicitor General Priyantha Nawana PC appeared for the Attorney General.

The main objective of participating at this travel exhibition was to create awareness about the Sri Lanka Tourism products, Promoting Sri Lanka Tourism in the Middle East, especially in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, promoting Ceylon tea throughout the Middle Eastern region, and providing the local trade industry participants to have one to one meetings with KSA operators.
The roadshow hosted by Sri Lanka Tourism was held prior to the exhibition, in order to create awareness about Sri Lanka as a travel destination and increase the number of tourist arrivals from Saudi Arabia, through presentations and B2B meetings.
The Sri Lankan delegation included representatives from Movenpick Hotel, Centauria travels, Asian adventures, Holiday park, Walkers tours, Exotic Global Holiday, Lanka holidays .net and figco Lanka holidays.

Sri Lanka Tourism in positive territory despite unexpected challenges
There was a time when Sri Lanka had to employ many strategies to attract tourists to the island due to unsafe security situations. There were many cancellations every year due to sudden explosions on a regular basis. From 1983 upto 2009 the situation remained almost the same with tourism authorities not receiving the full value for their promotional efforts and money spent on promotion.
Since mid 2009 the picture turned rosy for the country with a basket of tourism products made available to the foreign travel agents and the Free Independent Travellers. All of a sudden Sri Lanka was positioned as a value added tourist destination in leisure circles. Since 2009, Sri Lanka embarked on a streamlined structure for tourism promotion and the country has reaped the benefits of the promotional drives, over a near decade. Many new international hotel chains initiated hotel projects in Sri Lanka with chains like Shangrila, Sheraton, Hyatt Regency and ITC to name a few. Sri Lanka became a much talked about tourist destination since we have a wide range of leisure products and travel packages for the genuine travelers.
Talking about the earnings from tourism we have now reached a level of a near US$ 4 billion from a mere US$ 500,000 platform before 2009. The arrivals have now passed the 2.1 million mark from around 350,000 in times of unsafe security situations. Hotel staff worked in fear expecting explosions anytime either inside the hotel or on the streets of major towns and this fear psychosis has gone away from the minds of hotel staff and also from the visiting hotel guests. Metal detectors and other sensitive security equipment greeted the guests on arrival at hotels. Tourism Authorities have worked tirelessly to make Sri Lanka Tourism a success story. Words of appreciation should go out to all parties connected to tourism from the hotel management staff, travel agents, diplomatic missions abroad, suppliers of food and beverage items, electronic and print media both here and abroad, airport staff, travel companies, guides and other support staff. All these parties joined hands with Sri Lanka Tourism to achieve the following objectives and goals for Sri Lanka.
* Becoming a major forex earner for the country from the industry
* Provision of a large number of direct and indirect employment to youth and others
* Remmittances from a large number of Sri Lankan hotel staff working abroad fortifying our foreign reserves
* Empowerment of rural folk especially in the fields of Agriculture, Horticulture, Fisheries, Livestock and other industries like rubber, coir and handloom industries
* Functioning as the Goodwill Ambassadors for Sri Lanka while holding travel promotions abroad or while participating in international travel exhibitions & other events
* Rural and urban poverty alleviation and raising of standards of living
* Engaging in social welfare measures through the CSR(corporate social responsibility) activities by the hotels, travel companies and the Tourism Authorities
* Improvement in literacy standards in rural areas especially to converse and communicate with the tourists visiting their respective areas,especially in English and other foreign languages.
* Promotion of SME sector to service the needs of the tourist industry
* Promotion of other forex earning avenues for SrI Lanka such as Exports, Foreign Direct Investments and Permanent Residency through the guests visiting Sri Lanka
* Selection of Sri Lanka by visiting guests for international events
* Attraction of International Non Governmental Organisations for setting up office in Sri Lanka
* Assistance to the national carrier throughout the year from bookings for travel
* Stock market promotion
* Income to restaurants, pubs and entertainment centers situated outside the hotels
* Higher taxes to the state
* Improvement of cash circulation in the country and rapid economic growth.
There are other tangible and intangible benefits to the country and the public at large directly resulting from the promotion of tourism. Over the years, the average monthly income of the hotel staff and management has increased substantially and this has increased their savings level and created demand for consumer & capital goods. A major drawback for the industry is the brain drain of senior staff who pursue higher studies, foreign employment and also settling down abroad with the educational requirements of their children. Therefore, a continuous stream of educated, trained and experienced staff cadres be ensured by the State/Private hotel schools in the country. Ready assistance be provided by the state for this purpose. The forex earnings from Tourism has in a big way assisted with the cause of meeting the trade deficit of the country.
The development of new and attractive tourism products is a major challenge for the industry. The success of the industry depends very much on value addition by creating new and contemporary tourism products taking advantage of the great many opportunities the country possesses and its geographical location. There are many hitherto untapped areas to take Sri Lanka to its next level in the field of international tourism.
Now let us look at the provisional figures for top ten countries in terms of tourist arrivals for calendar year 2017.
COUNTRY ARRIVALS
INDIA 384,628
P.R. CHINA 268,952
U.K. 201,879
GERMANY 130,227
FRANCE 97,282
AUSTRALIA 81,281
MALDIVES 67,452
RUSSIA 59,191
U.S.A. 57,479
NETHERLANDS 51,148
The total number of arrivals for 2017 was 2,116,407. In comparison with 2016, the highest percentage increase came from Netherlands with an increase of 23.6% in arrivals for 2017.
The year 2018 started on a promising note with an overall increase of 12.6% for January 2018 in comparison to 2017 January. With India leading the way with a 40% increase, followed by Australia (22.6%) and Germany (20.2%). However, Chinese market needs new strategies for arrival augmentation.
Arrival improvements
Improvements could be designed on following lines with different strategies for different markets.
* Health Tourism
* Adventure Tourism
* Sports Tourism
* MICE Tourism
* Shopping festivals
* Trade and Export Fairs
* Special winter and Pre-winter tours
* Off season special promotions
* Discounted fares by National carrier
* Regional Promotions SAARC, BIMSTEC, ASEAN, EUROPEAN and MIDDLE EASTERN, PACIFIC RIM.
11. Religious and Cultural tours
Starting afresh for 2018, the market survey reports from our diplomatic missions will go a long way towards designing both off season and seasonal strategies for different markets in different countries. The visitors always seek Value For Money Spent for any type of holiday and utmost safety.
We can embark on special promotions based on superior products of Sri Lanka such as Apparels, Gems and Jewellery. It was reported in print media recently that Her Majesty the Queen Elizabeth showing one of her necklaces made of gem stones of Sri Lankan origin. Our Apparels also draw the attention of customers worldwide. Further, we have large blocks of land in the outstations with scenic surroundings ideally suited for Golfing and other sports. Most Golf resorts over the world have Guests with extended stays. The Tourism Authorities should engage in joint promotions with Export Development Board, Board Of Investment and even with Colombo Stock Exchange also for joint marketing strategies.
The ingredients and tourist destinations we have are much attractive than some of the countries in Asia. The visitors can move from one climatic condition in Sri Lanka to another within a few hours by road. Even former US Ambassador to Sri Lanka James Spain selected Sri Lanka as his second home after retirement. Famous science fiction Author Arthur C Clarke was permanently residing in SrI Lanka for a very long time. Sri Lanka is not short of premium destinations for extended holidays. This type of extended holidays are the need of high net worth foreign nationals. Another area would be to attract the legendary tourism netting in higher earnings. In the past ex Beatle Sir Paul McCartney had an extended stay in the south at an exotic location. Indian cricketer and former captain Rahul Dravid had his honeymoon in an exclusive plantation resort by the name of Hunas Falls Hotel with panoramic surroundings and exclusive facilities. Very recently Bollywood film idols Deepika Padukone and Ranveer Singh had an exclusive visit to the island. The high net worth/ledgendary tourists are quite willing to come to Sri Lanka provided they have the utmost privacy, top security and facilities in the top bracket. Our travel agents should create many such locations in almost all parts of the country for this type of visitors to have a wider choice. Such tourists need very personalized attention from their arrival at the airport until their departure.
The travel companies and the regional hotel associations should initiate travel clubs in different countries through social media networks and by organizing fruitful events abroad so that they can enjoy continued business throughout the year from the members of these travel clubs. The members would feel very much at home by coming to Sri Lanka for holidays at discounted room tariff rates and possibly with lower air fares from our national carrier. These travel clubs will form long term alliances with Sri Lanka and will visit Sri Lanka in times of emergency and natural calamities in their own country. Specialisation of their food/beverage by the hotels will add to the scheme as a plus point. However, there are a few matters of utmost importance which should be addressed by the state as improvement/remedial measures for any type of visitor. Some of them are:
* Improvement of the Colombo Airport
* Improvement of facilities at places like Sigiriya, especially the toilets and issuing of tickets
* Exploitation of FIT visitors by persons posing as tour guides
* Improvement of road safety measures when visiting outstation resorts and places of interest
* Improvement of facilities at the Colombo zoo with value additions
* Assistance and proper guidance in visiting the places of religious worship
* Identification of religious places of worship belonging to all four major religions practiced in Sri Lanka and development of same for visits by tourists from many more countries.
* More infrastructure developments such as highways, railway lines (especially the up country railway) and provision of electricity, sanitary facilities and clean water at every tourist destination
* Control of fast spreading epidemics which can cause sudden tour cancellations
* Appointment of beach cleaning staff for every beach resort, working from 6 am to 8 a.m. daily to ensure safe and clean beaches for every tourist
* Commencement of a news programme telecast in a number of major world languages especially in French, German, Chinese, Hindi and Russian in addition to English for 5 to 10 minutes weekly highlighting the special events in Sri Lanka in the late evening hours followed by a repeat telecast in the early morning so that the visitors will take interest in visiting many places in Sri Lanka as they will get first hand information on such places & events and will develop an interest to visit such places possibly by extension of their stay.
* Tackling of traffic problems should be looked into by the Tourism Authorities in close coordination with traffic police at least during the tourist season as tourists will not like delays in their travel time and will create a big impression on the tourism in the country.
* A Traffic police unit should also be created in major tourist locations who can converse in different languages. This will create a sense of belongingness on the part of tourists visiting such prime places of tourist interest.
* A centre to learn the playing of traditional local musical instruments especially originated from up country. I have seen many visiting tourists practice and play the Lankan traditional music as a group and they love to carry photographs and video footages of such performances.
* A Re-commencement of the Foster Parents Scheme which existed in the late eighties and early nineties could be relaunched with the participation of the foreign tourists. I am sure this scheme will be a major success with the likelihood of participating tourists becoming repeat guests to this paradise isle of Sri Lanka.
A tourism promotional matrix be compiled based on current and past experiences taking into consideration the sensitiveness and behavioural patterns of different overseas markets. A Benchmark Analysis will also prove useful with a sensitivity Analysis for changes in positive and favourable factors affecting tourism.

Stokes shakes up England side for pink-ball test against NZ
WELLINGTON, Tuesday: All-rounder Ben Stokes probable return is likely to be a major determinant in the makeup of his under-fire England team as New Zealand enters the pink ball era with their first day-night test at home at Eden Park starting on Thursday.
Stokes missed the 4-0 Ashes series loss in Australia while he awaited the outcome of an investigation into an alleged assault. The 26-year-old entered a plea of not guilty via video link with a Bristol court on March 12.
England have retained much the same squad that lost the Ashes and Stokes absence for that series was evident not just across the Tasman but when he returned to Englands one-day side against New Zealand earlier this month.
He was a major influence in the field, with several stunning catches and diving stops while he provided additional fire-power as the batting all-rounder with 141 runs at an average of 47. Its just having him in the side, off-spinning all-rounder Moeen Ali told British media. Knowing weve got a much stronger side when hes playing, it gives everyone else a good lift.
I know hes ready to go, and ready to perform, and give back to the team.
Stokes, however, has been battling a back injury sustained while diving when fielding during the one-day series and pending a fitness test may just play as a batsman, necessitating the need for an extra bowler.
Craig Overton and Mark Wood are then likely to be competing to join Chris Woakes, Jimmy Anderson and Stuart Broad.
Anderson and Broads new ball partnership, however, looks like it could be broken with Woakes and Wood sharing the responsibility with Anderson in a warm-up match in Hamilton that was played with both a pink and a red ball.
Anderson told Britains Sky Sports the decision appeared to be because captain Joe Root was contemplating a future without the pair, who have a combined 922 test wickets between them and consistently opened the bowling for the last decade.
Obviously hes disappointed, hes a very proud bloke and we have opened the bowling for a number of years, Anderson said.
Hes bowled first change in the past and I can see what Joe wants to do with looking to the future but also having that experience coming on first change.
The 31-year-old Broad had a poor 2017 and took just 30 wickets in 11 matches last year at 38.80. However he has 399 test wickets and should become the 15th player to pass the 400-milestone at Eden Park.
New Zealands lineup will also undergo a shakeup with all-rounder Mitchell Santner ruled out for the next nine months due to knee surgery, while top-order batsman Ross Taylor is battling a thigh injury sustained during the one-day series. Santner had occupied the number six batting slot and was the teams first-choice spinner as New Zealand beat an under-prepared West Indies side 2-0 in December.
The 26-year-old then produced arguably career-best form with the bat during the one-day series against England, scoring 216 runs in four innings at an average of 108 and his absence lengthens the home sides tail.
Either all-rounder Colin de Grandhomme or returning wicketkeeper BJ Watling will be forced up the order, with leg-spinner Todd Astle likely to bat at number eight if conditions do not tip the selection to going with four seamers. Astle has played just two previous tests and bowled only four overs when he last played a test match against Pakistan in November, 2016.
The second match in the series, a traditional red ball match, is at Hagley Oval in Christchurch from March 30.  Agencies

Strength is in unity not numbers
It seemed an impossible task to gain the 4x110 yards relay record from the formidable Royalists. Everyone thought so, including the Josephian coach. As the anchor, I told the other runners if we exchange the baton as a team, we will win. The first lap was taken by a Singhalese, the second by a Muslim, the third by a Burgher; it was neck and neck when I received the baton giving me an opportunity of ruffling the feathers of the Royalists.
My home is Negombo. So were the home of my parents, their parents and their parents down the mists of time and dare not do anything to tarnish the reputation of this ancient, multi-racial and proud town which the Dutch with all her armed might could not humiliate or subdue.
My foster home is Kandy. Beloved, because it was on the hallowed Asgiriya grounds, as a 14 year old, coming all the way from Kurunegala, in a rickety bus seated on a wooden plank described as a seat, a 4 hour journey, thereafter sleeping alone on a bench in the gym of St Sylvesters because the rest of the small contingent left to be with their relatives. On the following day looking at the well-manicured beautiful Grounds of Asgiriya I was convinced, after having trained on an abandoned paddy field and outrunning wild buffaloes, I could outrun even the Devil, running bare feet.
They were cocky, walking about in their school blazers. Others were lying on long tables inside the pavilion the masseurs feverishly toning their muscles. Parents with Thermos flasks were serving hot drinks to their sons getting them warmed up to meet all challenges. I had nothing. Waiting and waiting, seated in the hot sun, on an abandoned roller but with grit and determination to stand up and be counted. That is the way Providence works if help is sought. Takes the disadvantaged from the paddy fields and mud of the streets and makes them champions.
Trinity College
After the shocks of the margin of defeats measured in yards not feet subsided, the famous coach of Trinity College Bultjens shook my rustic hand and invited me to join Trinity College, offering a scholarship with full board and free tuition, which offers l conveyed to my father who in turn told Bro Alban the Headmaster of St Anne's, who reminded my father that Church rules do not permit a Catholic boy to attend a non Catholic school when a Catholic school was available. It was then Fate took my hand and led me to Darley Road, Thurstan Road, and then on scholarships to London, New York and Washington, a long journey the purpose for which I simply could not understand, just the way I cannot understand the need for expanding a function in a Fourier series of orthogonal Sines and Cosines. When the envelope with stamps came from Madras into the hands of Hardy at Cambridge with Ramanujan's equations he did not understand them and was forced to seek help from Littlewood, a Senior Wrangler, who decomposed some equations by using the Fourier Series. Why he did that is not explained.
It was in Washington I learned what true mathematical elegance is by talking to Robert McNamara, then President of the World Bank when he visited the Economic Development Institute where I was a scholar. He was a specialist in Management through statistical control and approached the twin scourges of racism and poverty, because where there is racism there is poverty, like a missionary.
He had a lifelong obsession with maths. This latter-day Archimedes once remarked that maths is a language to him and the only true basis to understand the curse of racism and its twin poverty.
My wife was born in Kandy. Years later we travelled to Kandy to join her parents when her father, a Supreme Court Judge, was presiding over the Assizes. I then took the opportunity to walk to the beautiful Asgiriya Grounds, sat on the very same abandoned roller, and allowed my emotions to trickle with a tear in my eye.
Ancient and elegant city
My emotions returned after reading with shock the recent events which tarnished the reputation worldwide of this ancient and elegant city. The incident was trivial which in other countries would be put down as road rage, a matter for the local police. When the cinder of racism was introduced by those who do not care a tuppence for this country, the cinder turned into an inferno. If the same incident was between a Singhalese lorry driver and Singhalese passengers in a 3 wheeler, nobody would have cared. Scribes who monopolize the opinion columns in the papers in the morning and sup with the devil in the evening are responsible for the recent dark chapter in our history. Expose, identify and condemn them as predators. They have no place in a decent and self-respecting society.
Now the centuries-old Trinity/Anthonian cricket match is cancelled. A match that gave the fastest century for St Anthony's by Anderson and century opening partnerships for Trinity by that graceful pair Pilapitiya and Sirimane. Old boys of both schools both Singhalese and Muslims must hold their hands in friendship and see whether the match can be played at a later date when things calm down.
Recently there was an incident at Koswatte Junction, the junction one meets travelling from Malabe before Battaramulla, proceeding towards Fort, which is now disciplined by a system of sophisticated traffic lights. The driver of a bus seeing a fancy car parked blocking the road had repeatedly tooted the horn, angering the passengers who happened to be an unsavoury politician, a sawdust thug and his equally despicable wife. Out they jumped and assaulted the bus driver, the wife brandishing a fully loaded pistol. Mind you, this happened on the day when the rest of the women in the world were peacefully celebrating Women's Rights Day. If the race had crept into the picture, the result a conflagration. The Talangama Police acted swiftly arrived on the scene and arrested the assailants. Here is an opportunity for the Police to demonstrate their grit, plant the flag and not retreat and for fearless magistrates to uphold the law at any cost, and remove the animals off the streets.
When I was attending St Mary's College Chilaw, my friends were mostly Muslims. There was Yousoof, the Arabic name for Joseph, who came to class wearing not a hijab but a fez. The Noordeen brothers and many more.
Gruesome tragedy
We often walked with our hands over each other's shoulders to places like Deduru Oya, and Pallama where a deadly incident recently took place. A boy of 12 sexually abused and killed by a monster. The hound from Hell fled with a team of Police in hot pursuit, was apprehended in a fishing village in Mullaitivu on the east coast of the island, a distance of over 200 miles from the scene of the incident. Say a rumour was spread that the boy was a Singhalese and the killer a Muslim the firestorm would have been unstoppable, sweeping all the way to Puttlam turning left at Palavi and travelling past Talawila to Kalpitiya, snuffing the lives of many an innocent who had nothing to do with the gruesome tragedy.
It is the duty of citizens who are truly devoted and love this country to erase any trace of racism from future incidents. Politicians and placard-carrying Pharisees, Sadducees have no place in this game.
If dug deep into the grit and mud you will discover they are the ones who are responsible for these occasional upheavals. To identify and annihilate must be a nonstop process. Not to be doused when there is a fire, forgotten, and then wait for the next. For that, the intelligence system must be well oiled and efficient. Use the hobos found seated in street corners. They are the best spies like the way the Police used Miss Marples in the celebrated detective series by Agatha Christie. I have a nose for clandestine things and very likely would have ended my career at the pinnacle if not for the sharp reminder at the final interview where I was told the University spends millions in training engineers not to run after thieves.
Fervent supporters of the Field Marshal believe he is the man for the hour. The Romans said you need only one, so long as that one is the right one. I was watching Aljazeera the other day where a scholarly Buddhist monk speaking in Singhalese was singing his praises and criticism for not appointing him as Minister of Law and Order and made a startling revelation. He said the background of agitators who are masquerading as Buddhist monks must be checked to find to which temples they belong to. Ubi dubium ibi libertas, where there is doubt there is freedom.
To be is to be perceived. We survive only by changing our reality as well as our image. We are creatures of God, unwilling to trim our sails according to every passing fad and not descendants of Apes. The notion of apes sits well only with Charles Darwin, given his bushy eye brows, bald head, short nose and the long beard.

Surveillance cameras on Police motorbikes in Monaragala
Surveillance cameras have been installed on seven Police motorbikes assigned to the highway in the Monaragala Police Division. The Police said that it came into effect from yesterday (20). The initiative was taken to reduce violation of traffic laws, to warn drivers by showing CCTV camera footage,issue charge sheets or file cases over traffic violations.These measures was mainly taken to prevent road accidents.
Furthermore, this will make the drivers obey traffic laws and ensure safe driving.
The Police said that when a driver is shown the video immediately after he or she is caught by the Police, there are more chances of them realising the careless mistakes they make. This would deter them from repeating the same mistakes.Posters have been displayed on either side of the roads in the Monaragala Police Division to inform the drivers of this initiative.

At least 35 civilians have been killed in a rocket attack on a busy market in a government-held district of Syria's capital Damascus, state media report.
Rebels in the besieged Eastern Ghouta region fired the rockets at Kashkoul, police.
Six other civilians were injured in a separate attack to the west, they said.
Rebel groups have stepped up artillery attacks since pro-government forces launched a major air and ground assault on the Eastern Ghouta a month ago.
The intense bombardment of the enclave by the Syrian military and its allies is believed to have left 1,400 civilians dead and led 50,000 others to flee.
Earlier, activists said a suspected Russian air strike had killed 15 children and four women sheltering in an underground school in the rebel-held town of Arbin.
UN aid agencies meanwhile expressed alarm at the "massive displacement" of civilians from the Eastern Ghouta and warned that many were in a very poor state of health, with children suffering malnutrition, scabies, diarrhoea and respiratory infections.

Ten-year plan to develop Colombo
A 10-year development plan has been initiated for Colombo under the theme Ape Colombo, the first female Mayor of Colombo Rosy Senanayake said on Monday, after taking oaths before Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees.
We are lucky to have the support of the government in implementing our 10-year plan in Colombo, she added.
Senanayake said the 10-year plan will focus on the physical development of Colombo, giving special attention to sewage disposal which would need an enormous amount of finance. Sewage disposal was a priority after the collapse of the Meethotamulla garbage dump which resulted in 32 deaths. The council further plans to construct 50,000 houses for underserved settlements, through the central government or by private  public partnerships.
Apart from the 10-year development project, special projects will be implemented to provide sanitation, drinking water, toilet facilities and restore the water pipes and sewage disposal systems. Projects to establish community centres and digitize services will start immediately.
We had a great victory at the past elections after 17 years and it is our duty to give the best to the citizens, making Colombo a safe and beautiful city, said the newly-appointed Mayor.
The Mayor also spoke about the increased female participation, stating, This is a historic and special occasion because 29 out of the 60 members are females. There were only two women last time.
The ceremony was presided over by the Prime Minister who witnessed the oaths taking with Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
Dengue fever and garbage disposal are major issues in the city.
We should work to eradicate these problems and create a better life for the people, said the Prime Minister.
Colombo was rated as the city with the highest rate of dengue casualties in 2017 with over 18,000 reported cases.
The Premier told the gathering: You were not selected by preferential votes, but as representatives of your divisions. Your duty is to visit these citizens and be with the people. We do not need members who come to the council by bicycle and goes back with Benz cars after four years.

First National Symposium on Data for SDGs launched
Towards evidence-based policymaking
The Government and the United Nations yesterday, jointly presented the First National Symposium on Data for the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in Colombo.
The Sustainable Development Goals are far reaching global goals, aimed at transforming the world; a global movement to end poverty, protect the planet and ensure prosperity to all. Sri Lanka, along with 192 countries, is committed to this ambitious agenda by agreeing to achieve the 17 global goals.
The role of data in this agenda is often downplayed. Data is the lifeblood of decision-making, without which policymakers are unable to make informed, effective and evidence-based decisions that lead to achieving the SDGs, UN Sri Lanka said in a release.
#SDGDataLK, Sri Lankas First National Symposium on Data for the SDGs, was inaugurated yesterday morning with the presence of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, the Deputy Speaker and Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Thilanga Sumpathipala, and the UN Resident Coordinator, Simrin Singh. The two-day symposium is a platform for enhancing the use of data towards evidence-based policy making and coordination of monitoring the progress on the SDGs in Sri Lanka.
Highlighting the importance of data, Simrin Singh said, Without data, we cannot know how many people are born and at what age they die; how many men, women and children still live in poverty; how many children need educating, and how many doctors to train.
Ten sessions will be conducted during the two days by 24 esteemed local and international resource persons. The sessions will discuss three main points:
Impact and Importance of Data; Context and Challenges of SDG data in Sri Lanka, and Strategy and Way Forward in using data for the SDGs. The discussions will focus on the need for mapping baseline data in Sri Lanka, against the 244 SDG indicators, to understand where Sri Lanka currently stands in the journey towards achieving the SDGs by 2030.
Speaking at the event, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya stated, For a country such as Sri Lanka, with established digital infrastructure, and 20.4 million people, gathering data should be more cohesive, and forward thinking. We should see how we can move away from the traditional methods to more technologically advanced systems that can provide real-time data that can guide policymaking in the country.
Thilanga Sumathipala, Deputy Speaker of Parliament, and Chairman of the Parliament Select Committee for the UN 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development stated, We have been working for more than a year since November 2016 and we have managed to publish a Parliamentary Report on SDGs, as the first country in the world to do so, making an assessment of the SDGs and the impact it can have on the country. For any country to go forward in achieving global goals, they need to have a plan to achieve those respective goals.
Participants include multiple stakeholders from the government, UN agencies, private sector, Civil Society Organizations, academia, and Data and Research Organizations.
#SDGDataLK was organized by the Government of Sri Lanka and the United Nations with the strategic partnership of the Select Committee of Parliament on the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development, Department of Census and Statistics, CITRA Social Innovation Lab, LIRNEasia, and Pulse Lab Jakarta.
Resource Partners included the Central Bank, the Centre for Poverty Analysis, Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, Ministry of Telecommunications and Digital Infrastructure, Sarvodaya Shramadana Movement, Transparency International, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Human Settlements Programme (UN HABITAT), United Nations Volunteers Programme (UNV) and World Health Organization (WHO).

Cargills agri-good revolution
Yielding farmer entrepreneur successful
Fresh vegetables and fruits hit the shelves of Cargills Food City supermarkets sooner. The countrys largest food manufacturer and retailer, Cargills(Ceylon) PLC, has ensured that fruits and vegetables reach their consumers in all its freshness.
The agricultural products, carrots, spring onions, cabbage, batana, knohl-kohl radish, red onions, long beans, green chillies plantains, beet capsicum, papaya, mangoes, guava, tomatoes, mushrooms, bell pepper spinach, leeks and leafy vegetables are harvested at proper maturity for the sustenance of quality and hygienic post-harvest life.
The products are transported from fields to nearby Cargills collection centers or procurement centers directly from the farms. The Cargills supply chain has reduced the transportation time for fruits and vegetables. The fruits and vegetables arc bought directly from the farmers, and non-farmers are not allowed to sell any agriculture products at the centers.
The companys efficient supply chain management has set up a system in which the farmers do not become vulnerable to exploitation by middlemen buyers.
The farmers working closely with Cargills Agriculture projects have learnt to capture opportunities and avoid the pitfalls of being trapped in supply chains operated by middlemen.
The company has slashed food wastage through good agriculture practices. Its effectiveness has benefited farmers to maximize their profits.
The transit of vegetables and fruits from farm gates to acquisition centers and from there to the food city markets takes place under good agriculture practice standards.
They come properly packed in fibreboard boxes and wooden crates to the market for the ease of handling.
The collection centers are hives of activity. According to the farmers, this is where they can get the highest value for their agriculture products.
They indicated self-assuredness with respect to being able to profit from agriculture.
Thousands of farmers remain confident today that they can sell their produce to Cargills. So far, we had a successful ride with the company, said farmers from Jaffna, Kuruengala and Kilinochchi.
Elimnatnig middlemen
Farming has taken a dramatic turn to a better direction in recent years with the Cargills accessing farming industry with a plan to empower the farmer community. The company approached with a very efficient supply chain management scheme to prevent farmers from being vulnerable to exploitation by those infamous middlemen.
Cargills purchase fruits and vegetables from the farmers at significantly higher prices. Because of their goods in higher demand, the farmers are now in a shape to profit from agriculture. The harvests too are booming with the kind of agriculture assistance they get from the companys agriculture business agents.
We met those farmers who work closely with these agents at their farms. After talking to them in the Jaffna and Puttalam districts, I realized that the general perception that farmers are simple people lacking any kind of sophistication is just invalid. It is absurd.

You will be pleasantly surprised if you talk to them about their farming activities nowadays, because they will tell you about things like soil management and how they like to diversify their farms for next growth cycle for economic viability and their plans to adopt some new technologies and practices to increases profitability of their farms and to develop efficient biological systems for the sustainability of their cultivations.
These farmers are knowledgeable and resourceful. The Cargills agriculture extension work has brought about change to their lifestyle and thinking. Their greater market integration and agriculture activities have apparently changed them into entrepreneurs. Moreover, they are an accepted community in their regions.
The times when the children of farmers felt shy to say that their father is such and such farmer is no longer there.
For teachers have started looking up for the children of farmers when money is needed for some school celebration activity or some physical infrastructure activity, for they have become much respected people.
Today, they talk about having farming enterprises. They are looking at innovative strategies and are receptive to new technologies.
We met the farmers in their fields to discuss their shared conviction of farming for economic growth.
Upscaling
Senanayaka Aarachchilage Shashika Pushpakumara is a guava fruit farmer based in Kalpitiya, Norochcholai of Puttalam. He has grown guava trees in a land of six acres with his friend, Rikaz, who has been his neighbour and childhood friend.
Shashika harvests more than 1,000 kilos of guava from his cultivation three days a week. He has become a popular farmer in his area due to his talent and innovativeness.
Shashika has 20 persons working under him in his farm. Cargills agriculture business agents have assisted him from the start up of things and beyond, said Shashika. The agriculture teams led by Cargills Agri Business Group Manager, Haridas Fernando helped me design my farm for profitability.
They passed on many guidelines on fertilization of the plants and the importance of irrigating the land in each production cycle, he said. Further, they advised me on how to protect the trees against diseases and growth deficiencies and to avoid reductions in yields.
According to Shashika, Cargills Agribusiness Group Manager, Haridas Fernando has played a dominant role toward the context of their success as guava growers.
We get a fairly good income from the guava fruits, said Shashika.
I expect my children to engage in this farming enterprise. I like my children to ensure its continuity after me, he said. We asked Cargills Agribusiness Group Manager Haridas, a deft hand at agriculture who has been around with the farmers assisting them in their farming endeavours, if the company has progressed in terms of achieving their objectives with their partnership with the farmers as the buyers of their products.
The company with over 330 Food City outlets covering all the districts obviously needs a lot of food and vegetables. The farmers had yet to meet out demand in full, he said.
It is not always easy to work with farmers. They often produce crops on their own cultivation plans without a proper understanding of the market requirements. There have been a huge post harvest loss of around 40% due to bad handling. By correct guidance and training we have made them market oriented, and reduced the post harvest down to eight percent. Thereby Cargills have managed to boost the income of the farmers to a great extent.
Also by the eliminating the middlemen, the company positioned itself to give a better price to the farmer, he said. This is indeed a social responsibility process. The government is happy about it, and we are happy that we started it, he explained.
Empowerment
Cargills buys about 120 tonnes of vegetable every day from the farmers, but it does not have any written agreement with the farmers, which means the farmers are free to sell their products to anyone. They bring their agriculture products to our procurement centers because they get a better price from us than anywhere else.
The company has also established a fund named Cargills Sarubima where it gives back 50 cents for each kilogram of vegetables it purchases from the farmers, to them.
Sarubima stands to empower the farmer community with a multitude of benefits. It provides scholarships and educational gifts, such as computers and laptops, to the children of farmer families.
Prasanna Asiri Waduge, is a farmer from the Galgamuwa electorate of Kurunegala. He grows tropical vegetables, such as bitter gourd, snake gourd and eggplant. Waduge has this to say about his relationship with Sarubima:
Sarubima provides laptops to our children if they pass their grade five scholarships, O level or A level exams, he said.
For those children of the farmers who have got selected for universities, Sarubima imparts money to carry out their educational activities. The company helps they helps them foot their tuition fees so that they may do well in their O level and A level exams.
Farmer families that supply agriculture products to Cargills are thus entitled to many benefits. We are thankful that we are relieved from the grip of middlemen because of Cargills. The Cargills collection centers pay us at least Rs 10 or Rs 15 more for a kilo of our vegetables and fruits.
Our produce must meet high quality standards to hit the shelves of Cargills Supermarkets. No matter what the size of the produce we bring, the company purchases them if they meet their specific standards, he explained.
In the olden days, it was virtually impossible to save any money through the sales of our produce. We were losing money hand over fists, because by the time we have finished buying seeds, plants, fertilizer and other equipment with that money for the next season, there was hardly any money left in our hands, he said.
Today, we work with the Cargills bank. Each of us has a bank account and we manage our receipts and payments through the bank, he said.
As pointed out by the farmers at Cargills Procurement Center in Thambuttegama, A.W.A.S. Abeysekera, A. Ajith De Soza, K.A.Piyal Thusithakumara and U.P.G. Muthubanda, the farmers supplying their agriculture products to Thambuttegama Cargills procurement center are confident and feel financially secure. The company helps us identify quality seeds and apprise us of modern technologies, said Ajith De Soyza (48) who is a cauliflower farmer in the main.
I also grow winged beans (dambala). I grow cauliflower for export. I did not know much about production technology of cauliflower. The companys extension officers passed down that knowledge to us.
About five years ago, cauliflower farming was not a common thing. With the help of Cagills, I was able to grow cauliflower.
With that knowledge, now can grow cauliflower under any weather and climate. Be it 100 kilos per day, I can provide, he said.
We asked the farmers about their use of agro-chemicals and pesticides on their cultivations. This is an area the consumers think that we may be using a lot of chemicals to grow our vegetables and fruits, but the truth is that this indeed calls for a lot of money from our part, said Thuisithakumara.
We always seek advice from Cargills agronomists should our cultivations become affected by pests or weeds, or by extreme weather, he said.
The company maintains what is called MRL (Minimum Residue Level). If our products are not compatible with theses standards, they will be rejected by the company. Cargills Manager and agriculture expert Haridas has this to say: The farmers sometimes had to spray chemicals to mitigate crop damage caused by pests. The problem with the agrochemicals is not in the use but in their dose.
Working with us over the years, these farmers today know how to use some of these chemicals successfully. Cargills maintains a policy of preserving organic integrity and vital qualities of the products at all stages of production when it comes to the agriculture sector, he added.
