Facebook video earns Warne, Slater and Pietersen seatbelt fines

Former Test cricketers Shane Warne, Kevin Pietersen and Michael Slater have been fined $300 (177) for not wearing seatbelts, after Warne posted a video of them in a moving car.
The four-minute Facebook video was filmed after day three of Australia's Test match against South Africa, where the men had been working as TV pundits.
Towards the end of the footage, the trio all put their belts on.
But Tasmania police were alerted to the infringement and reviewed the video.
In a statement, the authorities said: "Tasmania police remind motorists that seatbelts save lives and urge drivers to insist their passengers buckle up too."
Former Australian captain Mark Taylor was driving the van and former wicketkeeper Ian Healy was a passenger in the front seat, but both were wearing seatbelts.

Kandy SC adapt well to wet conditions

Kandy SC claimed their second victory in the 2016-17 inter-club league rugby tournament after overcoming a downpour in Colombo. This win for the defending champions was hugely impressive as they showed their full box of tricks and played the rugby that was required in the torrential rain.
The Nittawela club and the soldiers played hard in the bucketing rain handling the wet ball admirably.
The elements were hugely challenging but Kandy SC, who missed their rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya in the last outing, had his presence and advice in this game.
He handled the game brilliantly and adjusted their game plan accordingly and was able to score 34 points against 10. They should have scored more points but the wet ball prevented it. Twenty-four points in the first 40 minutes gave them a great platform to launch and as the time ran out the scores kept rolling on.
With confidence at an all-time high, Kandy SC captain Rohan Weeraratne kept his cool in the game. Army SC played a fine game in the last 20 minutes.
It was a class act and they showed that they are a good team capable of causing upsets along the way, but here they committed too many errors and Kandy SC took full advantage of them. Sad to say three of the Armys top players were side lined due to disciplinary reasons, by the SLRFU and also their coach. They are a side that's building up and with more focus are sure to do well in the remaining games.
A notable incident that occurred during the match was when referee when Priyantha Gunaratne was tackled in the seventh minute of the game by a soldier.
The first half was played without lights and in the second half they had to introduce lights due to semi-darkness. In the 12th minute of the second half play was halted for about seven minutes due to lightning.

Sri Lanka snatch a thriller to enter final

BULAWAYO, Wednesday - Sri Lanka took three wickets in the last three overs to snatch a thrilling one-run victory over West Indies in the triangular one-day series on Wednesday.
Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis both scored 94 runs as Sri Lanka posted 330 for seven from their 50 overs but for the second game running, West Indies worked themselves into a winning position before falling agonisingly short of their target as they finished on 329 for nine. Needing 10 runs off the final over bowled by Nuwan Pradeep, Sulieman Benn belted the third delivery for six to leave the West Indies requiring three runs from the final three balls.
But amid a frantic finish they could only manage one more run and must now battle hosts Zimbabwe on Friday to determine who will play Sri Lanka in Sundays Tri-Series final. A sparkling maiden ODI century from West Indies opener Evin Lewis (148 from 122 balls) was in vain as captain Jason Holder (45 not out) was the only other batsman to get past 30 in the innings.
As they had done in their last match against Zimbabwe, when they could only manage three from the final over to tie, West Indies failed to close out the match. Lewis was one of three run outs in the innings that came at crucial times and kept Sri Lanka in the game. Dickwella and Mendis shared a 107-run partnership for the third wicket as Sri Lanka posted a formidable 330 in their innings.
Dickwella fell six runs short of a century as he was trapped leg before wicket by Holder and Mendis then also missed out as he edged a delivery from Ashley Nurse.

Smith upbeat over  start-from-scratch Aussies

ADELAIDE, Wednesday  Skipper Steve Smith on Wednesday insisted he was excited rather than daunted as a drastically reshaped Australia look to avoid their first ever home Test series whitewash against rampant South Africa.
Australias cull after two Test thrashings has extended to five changes to the starting team for the day-night third Test in Adelaide, including three debutants.
But Smith was upbeat about the changes, which include English-born opener Matt Renshaw and fellow newcomers Peter Handscomb and Nic Maddinson. Im really excited. I think its a great opportunity for me to stamp my authority on this team as the leader, Smith said ahead of the first day on Thursday.
Ive almost felt a little shift over the last couple of days in attitude and energy from what the new guys have brought in.
I know that growth doesnt happen overnight, so it could take some time, but I am confident that with the guys we have here that we can start turning our results around straight away and start playing the way we want to play. AFP

SLCA to use Rs. 4m revenue from Australia to assist past cricketers

The Sri Lanka Cricketers Association (SLCA) is to receive revenue of Rs. 4 Million from the two matches played by the 1996 Sri Lanka World Cup winning team in Melbourne and Sydney which they hope to utilize to help past cricketers who are in need of financial assistance.
The event organized by Asanka Gurusinha now domiciled in Australia and a member of the World Cup winning squad also included dinner dances which helped them collect a handsome sum.
ACM Lafir, former Sri Lanka opener of the pre-Test era and a committee member of SLCA said two of the past cricketers the association had in mind of helping immediately are former wicket-keeper batsman Russell Hamer who is sick and ailing and former Sri Lanka captain Anura Tennekoon who has requested for financial assistance.
The money we are receiving from Australia will be utilized strictly to help old cricketers who are in dire financial straits, said Lafir.
He revealed that seven past cricketers received a monthly allowance of Rs. 10,000 for several years until the finance company they had invested the money crashed and since then the association has stopped the payments.
We are trying to bring a resolution at the AGM on December 8 to revive it, said Lafir.
The SLCA is headed by former Sri Lanka Test fast bowler Graeme Labrooy and includes past cricketers like Roshan Mahanama, Pramodya Wickremasinghe and Ken de Alwis.
