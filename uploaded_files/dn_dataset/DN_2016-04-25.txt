SLC has a lot to answer for crickets downfall  Sangakkara
Former Sri Lanka captain and legendary batsman Kumar Sangakkara blamed Sri Lanka Cricket and its administrators for failing to arrest the slump the national team is currently going through.
Sri Lankas performance has dipped in all three formats of the game after the retirements of Mahela Jayawardene and Sangakkara from international cricket. It was quite evident from their pretty woeful defence of their World T20 title in India, where Sri Lanka won only one of their four group games.
Interviewed on BBCs program Stumped Sangakkara asked the question what needs to be done to arrest the slump said, Planning over the last two years has not been the best. I left T20 cricket two years ago so did Mahela and we still have a large amount of the same squad who played in this particular edition (World T20).
We have Test cricket good performances against the West Indies and not so good against New Zealand, both at home and away we have been tested. Transition yes but the point is have we transition well Are we putting the right structures in place and the procedures in place to ensure this transition period does not last much longer but actually becomes a period where the team has grown and got over the fact that players have retired because players do retire and many more will over the next years Are we actually giving our best cricketers the opportunity to continuously play their best cricket And the answer is probably No.
Speaking further Sangakkara said, Luckily for us we have Graham Ford who has taken over. He is a man who knows how to build sides in the long term. He is a great asset to have at a time like this when the going is tough.
We do have some wonderfully talented players but our structure needs to be fine tuned at first-class level without a doubt. We need to ensure that there is more quality, there is better competition and there is a lot more of a challenge to players to get better where they are continuously tested in skill, in temperament, in character, in mental ability and mental skills so that they can transition not just from under 19 level to first-class level and first-class to international level with a lot more comfort.
Sangakkara questioned SLC whether they have everything in place to fine tune the talent and potential that is abounding in the country to actual ability and quantifiable performances on the field.
Its going to be a very important period for Sri Lanka Cricket to answer those questions and answer them very well, said Sangakkara.
Any past players in Sri Lanka they are very open to being of help. You dont have to be an integral part of the administration to be of service to cricket, he said.
You can do that in your own way, in a large way, a small way, doesnt matter what the role is but I believe all players past and present should take up that mantle and that responsibility of ensuring that you give back something to the game.
Sangakkara is presently playing for Surrey in the English county championships and admitted that he missed international cricket but does not regret the decision he took to quit it.
The ultimate is going out there in the middle and batting long, there is no substitute for that. Thats something I am going to miss at international level no doubt, but life moves on and you have to move with it, Sangakkara said.

Kaushal Silva knocked unconscious
Sri Lanka Test opener Kaushal Silva was knocked out stone cold during a two-day practice match played at Pallekele Stadium yesterday when he was hit on the back of his head by a ball while fielding at his customary position at short leg.
The incident took place during the practice match played by the national squad players preparing for next months tour to England.
Silva suffered the injury when team member Dinesh Chandimal swept a ball from spinner Tharindu Kaushal. Silva fielding at short leg although taking evasive action was hit on the back of his head and collapsed on the field.
Kaushal was unconscious and he had to be taken on a stretcher and rushed to the Kandy General Hospital, said team manager Charith Senanayake.
A head scan was done and the neuro surgeon said that there was nothing to be alarmed about and that he was out of danger.
However we transferred Kaushal to Colombo where he is presently being treated at the Nawaloka Hospital, he said. Senanayake said that Silva was wearing the latest helmet that came into the market with protection at the back of his neck and that may have probably saved him from any serious injury. The protective helmet was introduced following the death of former Australian cricketer Phil Hughes who died after being hit behind his ear while batting during a Sheffield Shield match in November 2014. Silva had on the first day of the two-day game scored a century and was fielding yesterday when the incident happened.
