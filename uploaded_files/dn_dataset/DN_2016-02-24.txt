All SLFP proposals on CC accepted
Power and Renewable Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera said yesterday that all proposals of the SLFP for the proposed new Constitutional Council have been accepted.
Therefore, the two main political parties have agreed on the process to draft a new constitution and no disagreements surfaced in this regard, he said addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday.
The deputy minister said the SLFP and other political parties have presented many amendments with regard to the parameters of the powers.
"We have just discussed the formulation of the new Constitution and we will discuss it's contents later. We have laid the foundation for the formulation of the new Constitution for the betterment of the country and the people. It was decided at yesterday's Parliamentary party leaders' meeting that the proposal on the Constitutional Council should be debated in Parliament today and tomorrow. Accordingly the parliamentary agenda has been altered. The debate will commence at 1.00 p.m. in the afternoon. It will be further debated when Parliament resumes sittings at 9.30 this morning."
The deputy minister said the party leaders have also agreed to conduct a vote at 6.30 p.m. today. "Although initially the debate was to take place only for one day, we have decided to extend it for two days to give every member a chance to voice their opinions".
He said if about 40 to 50 members disturb the proceedings of a House which has 225 members, then it is not democracy.
"If the members of the joint opposition have problems it should be solved internally without disturbing the other 175 members. The Speaker has also acted in a very impartial manner in this situation. If there are members who seek to use rough tactics to achieve their aims , we will face them successfully. We will go on with our forward march," Perera said.
Commenting on objections of various parties on postponing the local government election, the deputy minister said the UNP always wants to hold the local government elections as soon as possible and consolidate the victory achieved on August 27 at local government level.
He said the Election Commissioner has informed that 57 amendments needs to be considered, while the SLFP has also called for the inclusion of all amendments before conducting the election.
"There are problems with regard to the delimitation which we hope to solve soon. We want to be fair by everyone and hold the election as soon as possible". Perera added that no secret agreement has been drafted and signed with India.
He requested the Opposition not to cause create unnecessary fears about an agreement which has even not been drafted.
"We do not do any thing which will harm the country and will always work transparently," he added.

Cultural high time
Cultural sensitivity is the best phrase that could encapsulate a unique event organized by the Colombo Branch of the Past Pupils Association (PPA) of the Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy recently at the Havelock City. Conducted under the of a cultural fair, with the underlying theme being Agayamu, Vindinemu Apema Nimayum ( a bad translation being: Let us Appreciate and Enjoy Our Own Creative Output) this event artfully combined  or rather, blurred the boundaries between --- cultural discourse and cultural endeavors. For instance, when one walked into this event, which was held at an above-the-ground locality called the Club House, the very first sights that could have belied the nature of the inner core of the event to an unsuspecting, yet curious visitor, was what could be called the corridor commercial space, which had a curious mix of traditional, high-quality local food featuring the cultural nuances of both the Sinhala and Tamil communities. Mingled with the traditional food were the book stalls from Vijitha Yapa and M D Gunasena, where a large collection of books were on display, from history to hysteria, and crime to cake baking. As if this concoction was not heady enough there was an exclusive hand-made jewelry counter. Of course, cultural sensitivity is not for the faint hearted  one would need to walk into the auditoriums to hear the program on offer introduced by Dr. Hemamala Ratwatte. Dr. Ratwattes introduction was aptly complimented when the countrys most famed Sinhala Professor J B Disanayaka deftly undertook a linguistic analysis of the Guttila Kaavya whereby skill of the original writer of the poem was rediscovered and cherished by an equally skilled articulator of the Sinhala language.
Disanayaka was only the tip of the ice berg, there were host of others: Indrani Meegama and Kamalika Pieris expounding the and analyzing their efforts to recapture the history of their schools, Mahamaya and Ananada, through their textual exercises titled With a Fistful of Rice and Kularatne of Ananda; Lucien Bulathsinhala combining art (Lyrics) and principles (media ethics) in a spell binding lecture; English poet and short story writer Kamala Wijeratne offering her own take on the Sinhala poem Ehelepola Kumaihamy; Deepthi Horagoda taking the viewers on a gastronomic journey through an exposition of the Last Kandyan dynastys recipes; Sachitra Mahendra explaining the ideology behind his Buddhist-inspired novel Didulana Duhuvilla and also offering an interesting take on the controversial episode involving Ven Gnanasara thero; poets Vivimarie Vanderpoorten, Ramya Charmalie Jirasinghe and Lalitha Wirasinghe displaying their inner souls as poets and philosophers through their work; Dr Asanatha Attanayake illustrating the inner workings and the inspirations of her poem Saddantha Premaya; Prof Sunnanda Mahendra engaging in an aesthetically-charged Kavi Maduwa; Padma Edirisighe baring the soul of her textual enterprise on Dona Catherina, titled From Flower to Pawn; and Dr Janaki Jayawardena engaging the audiences with her own perspectives on Lorna Devarajas classic book Kandyan Kingdom; the author Daya Dissanayake exploring the act of translation with Dr. Asantha Attanayaka; Attanayake M Herath taking the audiences through the GCE O/L and A/L Sinhala Literature syllabuses; Timan Keerthi and Dhananath with their own exposition of Yannang Chandare.
The present students of Mahamaya Girls possibly blurred the time-space between them and the PPA by powering the Cultural Fair with innovative renditions of Kumaratunga Munidasaa play Hath Pana and the ancient dance tune Gajaga Wannama. The mother of all Sri Lankas chefs, Koluu, provided a grand lunch-time cookery demonstration whose core was his intrinsic innovation, and his great ability to make a great Prawn Curry without a lot of fuss and chemicals. Sri Lankas ace story teller Sybil Wettasinghe, meanwhile, captivated the younger audiences with her own inimitable story telling. All in all, it was an unforgettable evening of cultural appreciation and sensitization  equally complemented by intellectual contemplation. Possibly, one year would have to pass before one could experience this feeling once again.

Donald Trump projected to win the Nevada Republican caucuses
Donald Trump will win the Nevada Republican caucuses, CNN projects, expanding his dominance in the early GOP contests despite the well-organized campaigns of his two chief rivals: Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio. The results in Nevada, a state with complex caucus rules and unreliable voter data, were yet another sign of how Trump's momentum is sweeping the country. He heads into the Super Tuesday contests riding high in the polls and maintaining a wide lead over the other GOP contenders in the delegate count.
Trump, who has campaigned on a hard-line immigration platform including a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, is winning Latino caucusgoers in Nevada. Entrance polls indicated Latinos made up 9% of the electorate and 44% of them planned to back Trump. Cruz and Rubio had campaigned aggressively in Nevada, but were largely engaged in a fight for second place as they try to consolidate Trump-averse Republican voters around them. Cruz has attempted to cobble together a coalition of evangelical and libertarian voters, while Rubio has argued that he is the most electable of the GOP candidates. Knowing that time is running short to overtake Trump, Cruz targeted Trump on Tuesday with his sharpest attacks yet. "Look, I frankly don't care what position Donald decides to support today, tomorrow or the next day.
They change every day. I don't care what they are. But pick one and defend it and don't pretend that whenever people suddenly point out what you said, 'Oh, never mind.' And look, part of the reason someone vacillates from position to position to position is they're not starting from a core set of principles and beliefs," Cruz said. Trump, in turn, sharply ridiculed Cruz. "I've met much tougher people than Ted Cruz. He is like a little baby compared to some of the people I have to deal with. He is like a little baby: soft, weak, little baby by comparison."(CNN)

Gaza women turn heads with bike rides
PALESTINIAN TERRITORIES: Four Palestinian women have turned heads in the Islamist-run Gaza Strip by doing what would pass unnoticed in many other places in the world: riding their bicycles.
The women are bucking tradition in the enclave hit by three wars since 2008 and under Israeli blockade.
One of them says that beyond enjoying simply going for a ride, she also hopes to make a statement.
Many people encourage and admire them, they say.
Others however insult or resent the women in their 20s and 30s because, in their view, they are violating Islamic decency.
For lots of people, when a woman does anything outside, its astonishing and surprising, said one of the four, 33-year-old English teacher Amneh Suleiman, sporting a black sweatsuit and matching hat.
For them, it goes against our traditions, but nothing in our religion prevents it.
She said that those restrictions must disappear and I am trying to send this message. Women play an active role in society and have the right to freedom.
With her friends Sara, Noor and Assalah, Suleiman regularly wheels her blue bicycle out of her home in Jabalia refugee camp.
The Gaza Strip has been run by Islamist movement Hamas since 2007, but it seems objections to their rides have more to do with traditional attitudes than any new regulations.
While Suleiman and her friends are voluntarily pedalling against the winds of conservatism, others are bending some of the old rules due to circumstances.
The devastation caused by war along with the blockade in place for nearly a decade have led to an increasing number of women working to help feed their families.
Palestinian women have long played a role in the struggle for statehood, with some holding senior political and diplomatic post. Others have even taken up arms.
But while nearly 60 percent of Palestinian graduates are women -- counting both Gaza and the occupied West Bank, which is run by the Palestinian Authority -- they represent only some 21 percent of the active labour force in Gaza.
That amounts to one of the lowest rates in the world.
Official statistics show that more than two-thirds of the women who do not work say they must devote themselves to being a housewife.
For Suleiman, who moved with her family to Gaza in 1994 after having lived in Syria, leisure can represent freedom, which is why she began riding in December, with her three friends joining her later.
We told ourselves: When we were children, we loved riding bicycles. Why not do it again she said.
Sara Sleibi, 24, has also defied restrictions that some would like to impose in Gaza.
Beyond tradition, a more radical strain of Islam has also taken root there in the form of Salafist jihadists who sympathise with the Islamic State group.
Their movement, which has presented a significant though still limited challenge to Hamas, has fed off young peoples desperation in the enclosed and impoverished coastal enclave.
When Sleibi takes her five-kilometre (three-mile) rides with her friends, all wearing leggings, jackets and trainers, she doesnt hesitate to stop to buy a bottle of water near a checkpoint run by Hamas security forces.
She says they greet her with a smile, like some of the drivers they pass, including those who stop to watch them go.
If all the girls start bicycling in Gaza, who will take taxis jibes Ayman, a 25-year-old taxi driver.
Not everyone is so welcoming, but Sleibi, who recruited her 20-year-old sister Noor to join the rides, says she doesnt let it bother her. I dont pay attention, she said.
Suleiman said the insults are not a problem. It only makes me sad for them.
We put only two pictures on Facebook and we received around 40 comments -- many compliments and four insulting us, she said.

I am bound by prevailing laws and Parliamentary traditions - Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that he is unable to satisfy all the demands of the Joint Opposition as his hands are tied by the prevailing laws and traditions in Parliament.
He was replying to a Point of Order raised by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena urging that a solution be given to their demand to be recognized as an independent group in the Opposition.
The Speaker observing that there were several demands by the Joint Opposition group, said he could not grant most of them, except the one demanding the right to raise questions under Standing Order 23(2).
"The Joint Opposition MPs demanded the rights to move adjournment motions, appoint their own members to the Committee on Public Enterprises, Public Accounts Committee and the Public Petitions Committee, more time to speak at the debates, and to raise questions under the Standing Order 23 -2.
"Accordingly, I agreed to give them opportunity to present an Adjournment Motion once a week, to allocate more time for them in debates, and asked them to send their nominees for the above mentioned committees. I have allocated 51 minutes out of 91 minutes for the Joint Opposition MPs today.
"The only question is with regard to the demand to make special statements under Standing Order 23-2. I studied all traditions and regulations and similar situations in other parliaments. This is a matter beyond my purview. You should settle it with the Party leadership. Do not expect that from me. I granted 90 percent of your demands" he said.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said a final agreement on the matter would be reached after a special meeting at 6pm yesterday with the presence of President Maithripala Sirisena.
"You all belong to the UPFA. Let's solve this issue while preserving the Parliamentary traditions. We may have to increase the number of hours and days that parliament sits. We could discuss that matter," he said.
At this point, MP Bandula Gunawardena asked to withhold the Standing Orders and permit them to make special statements. Replying to this the Prime Minister said, "You could join the UNP.
Ask for applications from the UNP General Secretary". Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella observed only the Opposition Leader or party leaders could make special statements under the provisions of Standing Order 23-2. "This Parliament only accepts five party leaders. Who is the sixth Who is the leader of the Joint Opposition There is no leader," he stated.

Liar, Liar: A charged word is now common in the GOP race
US: A photograph posted on a website by Ted Cruz's presidential campaign last week appeared to show his rival, Marco Rubio, shaking hands with the dreaded Democratic president, Barack Obama.
The picture, though, was a fake -- a crude Photoshop image of Rubio's head posted on another person's body.
This is how phony and how deceitful the Cruz campaign has become, Rubio adviser Todd Harris told reporters here, alleging that Cruz has created a culture of lies.
In the Republican presidential contest, 2016 has become the year of the liar.
Once considered the semantic equivalent of tossing a grenade, use of the word has become routine among Republicans vying for the presidential nomination and their staff members. Candidates accuse one another of lying. They defend themselves from accusations of untruths. During the last Republican debate, liar or some variant was used at least 20 times.
For a number of weeks now, Ted Cruz has just been telling lies, Rubio said during the debate. He lied about Ben Carson in Iowa. He lies about Planned Parenthood. He lies about marriage. He's lying about all sorts of things.
The language this year, including the liar tag, seems notably coarser than in past election cycles. Hearing words once considered off-limits is no longer strange.
I certainly can't recall anything like what we're hearing now, said Mark Liberman, a professor of linguistics at the University of Pennsylvania.
Among the many rough words and phrases used by GOP candidates to describe their opponents this cycle are pussy, jackass and unstable. But liar seems to have the most staying power.
It's clearly a blow to the civility of the election discourse, said William Mayer, a professor of political science at Northeastern University.
Rarely a day goes by now that the word is not used. Frustrated by the tenor of the debate, the conservative Weekly Standard wrote that the candidates should try a new variation of Ronald Reagan's famous 11th commandment that thou shalt not speak ill of any Republican.
The Republican presidential field could at least try to observe a twelfth commandment: Thou shalt avoid calling one's fellow Republican a liar, the magazine wrote.
For the most part, the epithet has been hurled against Cruz, who is in a heated race for second place here with Rubio and has faced repeated accusations of lying from both Donald Trump and Rubio.
He is a liar, Trump said of Cruz in a statement released Wednesday. Pointing at Cruz during the debate Trump said, You are the single biggest liar.
At a rally Friday in Myrtle Beach, S.C., Trump went after Cruz again.
This Ted Cruz, this is the biggest liar, he said. . . . Even Marco Rubio said he's a liar . . . This guy, Ted Cruz, is a liar.
Trump has also uncorked the word on former Florida Governor Jeb Bush. I'd like to call JEB a liar, but the truth is he has no clue and never revealed that he used Eminent Domain - when criticizing me! Trump wrote on Twitter.
Politicians calling one another a liar has happened in the past.
Prior to the current race, perhaps the most well-known use of the liar charge by a politician came in 2009, when Rep. Joe Wilson, R-S.C., yelled you lie! at President Obama during the State of the Union address. Wilson was booed and formally rebuked by the House in a vote that fell largely along party lines; he refused to apologize.
Using the word once had far more dire consequences: a duel. According to the Encyclopedia of Arkansas History and Culture, in 1827 Henry Conway, who was running for reelection to Congress, called Robert Crittenden, the acting governor of the state, a liar in a published letter. The two men had a duel and Conway died from his wounds 11 days later.
When asked about use of the word liar, Cruz supporter and House member Steve King, R-Iowa, said: Aaron Burr and Alexander Hamilton fought a duel to the death over such allegations, and now we have them hurled out as if making that allegation somehow makes it true and makes it stick.
Mayer said calling someone a liar raises the stakes and implies something harsher than simple disagreement.
I'm implying very different things about an alternative candidate if I say you're lying or I disagree with you or you're mistaken,  he said.
Richard D. Anderson Jr., a professor of political science at the University of California at Los Angeles who has studied political linguistics, said the tone has something to do with the dynamics of the race, including the public's distrust of career politicians.
The word liar, Anderson said, is evoking people's anger and unhappiness with fellow politicians.
Rubio has long accused Cruz of distorting the truth, but the Florida Republican's campaign said the argument has only broken through this week as Rubio and Trump have focused on it. Trump's accusation at the debate that Cruz is a liar amplified the message before a broad audience like never before.
He's lying - and I think it's disturbing, Rubio told reporters this week before hopping on his campaign bus in Beaufort, S.C.
Rubio added: Just here in South Carolina this week, he's lied about my record on Planned Parenthood, he's lied about my position on marriage, he's lied about his own record on immigration, and so I think this is very disturbing when you have a candidate that now, on a regular basis, just makes things up.
And especially in this era where everything is out there and everything is seen and instantly reacted to, you can't get away with that stuff.
Jason Miller, a spokesman for Cruz, said the word liar has become the only message from Trump or Rubio.
South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley, R, when asked whether the pervasive use of the word would turn off voters, said people here know how to cut through the mud of this state's rough-and-tumble campaigning.
When you come to South Carolina, it's a blood sport, she said. I wear heels, it's not for a fashion statement. It's because you've got to be prepared to kick at any time.
But some voters don't like it. When asked about the use of the word liar, Carrie Williford, 37, from Greer, S.C., who was attending a Cruz rally in Spartanburg, made an annoyed face.
The word is overused, she said. It sounds like fifth grade schoolyard type stuff.

The government will never let anyone to sabotage the good work it is carrying on, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa said. He said that the opposition members who were defeated twice should find out their mistakes and extend their support for the good work of the government.
But they just initiate atrocious conspiracies against the government by using various political slogans such as Stop signing trade agreements, he said. Members of the joint opposition are attempting to revolt against the government which is engaged in providing benefits to one million youth. This gang will become the traitors to a million unemployed youth of the country, he said.

He said that a new National Youth Charter will also be launched at the summit. "The country's youth have no life and future within the prevailing political, social and cultural environment of the country", he said. He also said the past 68 years had failed to provide a political solution to the issues faced by the country's youth. "Neither the Rajapaksa Family nor the present joint government have provided us with a positive solution to these issues. We urge country's youth to extend their support to a modern socialist political movement, as only a modern socialists government can provide answers", he said.

Saudi Prince: Muslim nations must lead in counterterrorism
UAE: A prominent Saudi prince said Sunday that Muslim countries need to take the lead in fighting terrorism and that a recently announced Islamic counterterrorism alliance of 34 nations should have been created sooner.
Prince Turki al-Faial's comments come as the kingdom hosts an 18-day military exercise with 20 members of the new alliance, which includes Pakistan, Sudan, Jordan and neighboring Gulf states. Defense Ministers from the coalition of Muslim-majority countries are scheduled to hold their first meeting in Saudi Arabia sometime in March.
"I consider this a leading and commendable step that should have happened sooner and thank God it has taken place," he told reporters in Abu Dhabi.
"It's no secret, unfortunately, that in our world today the majority of terrorism-related acts, its victims are Muslim," he said. "Therefore, it is our responsibility as Muslim countries to play the primary role in fighting this disease that has impacted us all."
Notably absent from the coalition is the kingdom's regional rival Iran, as well as Syria and Iraq, which are battling to win back swaths of territory controlled by the Islamic State group.
Sunni-majority Saudi Arabia and Shiite-majority Iran are fiercely divided on a host of issues and support opposite sides of the wars in Yemen and Syria.
Relations worsened after the execution of a popular Shiite cleric in Saudi Arabia last month, which triggered protests in Iran and the ransacking of the Saudi Embassy and another diplomatic mission there. The two countries then severed diplomatic and trade ties.
Prince Turki said "the ball is in the Iranian court" when it comes to any hope of improving ties.
"The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has expressed publicly that Iran's interference in the affairs of Arab states is a situation that is unacceptable," he said.
The prince, who does not hold an official position in the government, is an influential and outspoken member of the Saudi royal family.
He headed Saudi Arabia's General Intelligence Directorate for more than two decades until Sept. 1, 2001, and held ambassador posts to the U.S., the U.K. and Ireland.
