Gotler and his comfort zone
Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said recently that he could not understand why the President, the Prime Minister, the Finance Minister and others are interested in a private anusasanawa by Ven. Vendaruwe Upali Anunayake Thera. It is hilarious to hear that from a person who once was responsible for security of this country. It is common knowledge that such anusasanawa made in the presence of media becomes public news.
He adds Those who have not fathomed the context of the sermon are making various comments. After all, Im an ordinary person and not someone of importance. I dont know the reason for issuing so many statements over a private anusasanawa to me at my residence, here Gota speaks like a retired army general doing nothing but attending Buddhist activities. Then he wants us to believe that all are against the Anunayake Thera. Of course the Buddha said the Dhamma should be preached to each person in a format according to the capacity and the wisdom to understand it. After misquoting the Buddha he arrogantly says I of course understood well what the venerable monk said. Those who havent understood the meaning are making these statements.
In the meantime, at the recent Matara meeting Mangala said We managed to reinstate the rule of law and democracy back in this country which was being diluted over the past decade while they were in power.
Nazi regime and previous government
Speaking of the recent comments that sparked about a Nazi regime, the minister drew parallels to the previous government where incidents similar to that of the Hitlers Nazi regime took place. Whenever the previous government didnt have sufficient support, they were in the practice of blackmailing and poaching people from parties that were opposed to them. This is the exact method in which Hitler operated as well. Once he managed to get a sufficient majority on his side, he ended up being a dictator who destroyed not only his country but created a big devastation in the world, the Minister said; he went on to remind the arbitrary procedure through which the former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranaike was ousted from her position overnight.
That path followed by the Rajapaksa regime was very much like Hitlers governance.
With Asgiri Upali Thera commenting on Gota, a valuable discussion on Buddhism and politics started in many directions. Buddhism is very close to ethics of governance just as Kants philosophy with Hegelianism influenced the bourgeoisie democratic revolution in Europe.
Many writers claim this Buddhist Monk has swept the very basic principles of consciousness Karuna, Metta, Muditha and Upekka exposed by the Buddha, off the floor. As we were informed by Ven. Kotagama Vachissara Thera at Ananda College, these four attitudes are said to be the right consciousness necessary for dealing with others and social existence in general. They provide, in fact, the answer to many fold situations arising from social contact. They remove tension, acting as the great peace-makers in social conflict, and the great healers of wounds suffered in the struggle of existence. They, also help to cut across social barriers, build harmonious communities; such consciousness awakens magnanimity, revive joy and hope of human brotherhood against the forces of egotism. When considered in that context the sermon preached by the Asgiri Chapter Anunayake becomes most unacceptable. Something is grievously wrong. It is wrong both in the content of the call for military rule as well as the process involved in making such a heinous call a reality.
If any reasonable man or woman thought that the cultural decline in our society is limited to the lay society, then one should think again. Because here is a high ranking Monk in the Buddhist order, while being enrobed in the usual saffron robe, has decided to wrap himself in the more expansive Nazi flag. Maybe the Swastika, the Nazi emblem, which in fact was a motif associated with ancient Asian Aryan religious thought, has taken hold of the personality of Anunayake Upali Thera. But in a more realistic context of modern Lankan politics, this degradation of religious thought signals a more sinister-degeneration replacing intelligent discourse amongst the general public in Lanka. On the one hand are the likes of Ven. Gnanasara Thera, whose religious standing is increasingly looking to be a matter of the past and on the other are these Buddhist Monks such as Vendaruwe Upali Thera, posing as representatives of a more traditional and orthodox teachings of Buddhism, preaching a military rule in a country whose people are committed to democracy, freedom and the fundamental human rights; have to take the matter more seriously.
Self-destroying bubble
In modern day politics such a statement coming from the lips of any person is purported to be a result of an orchestrated piece of aggressive kind of public relations. But what is even more dangerous is if the prelates words were a true enunciation of authentic beliefs held by him.
It may not be as humble Upali Sadu announced later. However nothing is more dangerous and outrageously harmful than a believer who thinks that he is always right in his decisions and also morally righteous. Gota is such, they say. This self-righteousness-belief renders him to be an island unto himself, making him ridiculously susceptible to a self-destroying bubble and that bubble is a creation of his own loyal cohorts and himself.
Gotler belongs to that self-defeating bubble. He dwells more in his own comforts zones making sure that wherever he goes is surrounded by his henchmen who benefitted immensely during his brothers regime. After being alleged of most heinous crimes, trying to preach justice and fair-play is like Lankans were born only after the demise of the Rajapaksa rule. Playing the victim is always the sign of a weak person. They say that the best example is the current US President Donald Trump. After inflicting most unspeakable insults on his opponents, when he is being treated the same way, the bully reacts as if he has been victimized by his antagonists. But the tragedy is that card carries, especially before a gullible audience, albeit in the short run, a lot of positive marks for the man or woman who plays it. Gotler may have chosen to play that card and it is the responsibility of those who will pass judgment on his whims and fancies, come out on Election Day.

Maybe England lacked respect, says Croatia coach
MOSCOW, Thursday: Croatia coach Zlatko Dalic admits his team were spurred on by what they saw as a lack of respect towards them in the English media as they won 2-1 in Wednesdays World Cup semi-final.
We always respect our opponents and expect them to respect us back, Dalic told reporters in Moscow on Thursday. Maybe England or the English media did not show enough respect to the Croatian national team, which we deserved, especially when you look at the clubs our players play for.
This may have given us extra motivation, but this is football, you have to be dignified in victory and in defeat. Croatia came from behind to win the game at the Luzhniki Stadium with Ivan Perisic equalising in the second half before Mario Mandzukic scored the decisive goal in extra time. Elements of the English media had talked up how tired Croatia might be coming into the game after being taken to extra time and penalties in each of the previous two rounds. Captain Luka Modric made comments similar to those of his coach following Wednesdays game, after a match which saw the dreams of English fans doused.  AFP

Brathwaite ton puts Windies in control against Bangladesh
KINGSTON, Thursday - Kraigg Brathwaite blasted another century while Shimron Hetmyer lashed an unbeaten 84 as the West Indies recovered from a slow start to dominate the opening day of the second and final Test against Bangladesh on Thursday.
Brathwaite, who scored a century in his teams innings victory over Bangladesh in Antigua last week, fired 110 -- his eighth Test ton -- as the hosts closed on 295 for four wickets off 92 overs at Sabina Park.
Hetmyer meanwhile played fluently and positively on his way to 84 not out, which came off 98 balls with nine fours and one six.
One of two changes to the side that thrashed Bangladesh by an innings and 219 runs inside three days in the first Test, he resumes on the second morning in partnership with Roston Chase.
Brathwaite played his own game from beginning to end and after the early loss of opening partner Devon Smith after the West Indies were put in on a pitch offering considerable assistance to the spinners from the outset, he featured in a succession of useful partnerships which lifted the home side to a position of comfort.
Hetmyer was the dominant contributor in a stand of 109 for the fourth wicket before Brathwaite departed as the third wicket of the innings to Mehidy Hasan.
It was Mehidy who created the early uncertainty in the West Indies camp by removing Smith to a bat-pad catch and then accounting for Kieran Powell who stroked 29 in a 50-run second-wicket stand before being trapped leg-before.
Brathwaite then had Shai Hope as his partner at the crease for most of the afternoon session, the pair extending their third-wicket partnership to 79 before Hope fell for 29, caught off the glove by wicketkeeper Nurul Hasan off Taijul Islam. Bangladesh were buoyant through the morning session as their spinners attempted to take control, delivering 33 of the 35 overs in the two hours before lunch.
It was a period of play when the tourists made full use of their slow bowling options on a pitch that was surprisingly helpful to them given the trend of grassy, fast bowler-friendly tracks for previous Tests in this 2018 Caribbean international season.
West Indies decision to omit specialist spinner Devendra Bishoo before the start of play appeared to suggest that another seaming, bouncing pitch was on offer to be exploited by an attack spearheaded by Shannon Gabriel and also incorporating captain Jason Holder, medium-pacer Miguel Cummins and debutant Keemo Paul, whose potential as a seam bowler and useful lower-order batsman gave him the nod ahead of lanky pacer Alzarri Joseph. West Indies are searching for their first home series win since 2014, when Bangladesh were also their opponents and were well beaten in Tests in St Vincent and St Lucia.  AFP

Call for the hangman in the politics of today
Is the hangmans noose a new image for popularity by the government President Sirisena is very keen on its revival, and the Cabinet, which he heads, has given the approval to hang prisoners convicted of drug offences who carry out such business from prison. Is this a message that would draw public support
At this weeks media briefing Cabinet Spokesman Minister Rajitha Senaratne said the government would consider activating the death sentence on convicts of extremely cruel and heinous crimes such as rape and murder, after carrying it out on convicted drug traffickers. This is certainly a dangerous trend, considering the fact that this country has not carried death sentences for over 40 years.
It is good to remember that the founder and first leader of the SLFP, the late SWRD Bandaranaike, was a strong supporter of the move to abolish the death penalty, and that he was strongly supported by the then LSSP leader and Leader of the Opposition, Dr. N. M. Perera. The move had much support from the rural masses  the Pancha Maha Bala Vegaya - that supported the SLFP, and the working class that supported the LSSP and CP. The temporary suspension of the death penalty was with the intent of making it permanent later, but Prime Minister Bandaranaike was assassinated shortly after. However, although the death penalty was restored for murder, and Prime Minister Bandaranaikes assassin, Talduve Somarama was hanged, the country has kept the suspension of this punishment until today. Those supporting the hangmans noose today must remember that the founder of the SLFP, who they always praised, was strongly against it.
It is necessary to carry out a good public discussion of the situation relating to crime and punishment in the country today, before steps are taken to re-employ the hangmen in our prisons, and also consider the acceptance or not of the death penalty internationally, and modern scientific and judicial thinking on crime and its control. Sri Lanka cannot rush into a situation where we copy the heinous strategies of the Philippine President Rodrigo Duterte or the Arab and authoritarian/dictatorial countries that still have this penalty and the USA too.
Those who call for the death penalty on convicts in prison engaged in drug trafficking, would do well to consider the conditions in our prisons today, and how the crooked and corrupt conditions there support and encourage many crimes. There are prisoners convicted for murder who enjoy privileges and luxuries, most law-abiding citizens are denied outside those walls. The government, and especially the President and Prime Minister should pay attention to the need to carry out far reaching reforms and modernizing our prisons, in keeping with international standards and the deeper teachings of Buddhism, before rushing to grab the popularity of hanging imprisoned drug traffickers. Those who have boasted of using a madu valigey or a sword of cleanliness to fight corruption, and have failed in their tasks, should see how much those weapons could be used to clean up our prisons, and make them places of good incarceration, before rushing in waving the hangmans noose.
This country certainly needs a re-think of the judicial system, including the death penalty. There can be religious leaders, of different faiths and teachings, who may agree with this penalty, but the need is to follow modern democratic principles in governance; and not rush in with a baggage of religious acceptance to carry out executions of prisoners already convicted of crimes but not executed. We must have good studies on how much the death penalty, even for convicted prisoners, will affect the rising trends of crime in the county. This includes drug trafficking, rape and the increasing threats to the youth from the forces of corruption.
In the wider context of the rising levels of crime, it is also necessary to give due consideration to the level of crime and corruption in the politics, and consequently governance in this country. How much do crooked politics affect the fight against crime and criminals, and how much does it influence the work and power of drug traffickers In the absence of good studies on these areas of social importance, it is indeed a mockery of democracy and good governance to make loud boasts of using the mara thonduva or death noose on convicted, and practising, drug traffickers.
China funding of polls
With the rise of opposition to Vijayakalas hope for a revival of the LTTE, by a slip of the tongue or mind, or an aspect of political thinking, the attention that the New York Times (NYT) report drew on a Chinese port company funding the last Mahinda Rajapaksa presidential poll campaign seems to be fading away. There are backbenchers in the government, especially UNPers, who are calling for statements from the Rajapaksas on the truth involved. Ranjan Ramanayake has sought a police investigation. However, the governments leaders are strangely quiet about this major aspect of electoral crookedness, as well the possible foreign impact on a presidential poll.
It is hardly likely that the Rajapaksas would make any clear statement on these allegations. It is in their interest to be silent about it, and let it fade away. On the current record of performance, there is not much one can expect from police investigations into these allegations, especially with the Police moving to meditation on the subject. This is a matter where the government should take the lead in full exposure.
The original story was published in the Daily News, in the early days of this government. There may have been reasons not to proceed with that probe, due to political considerations and international relations. However, the NYT report does mention documents seen from an investigation, which makes it clear that the search for the truth was not only by the NYT. We are now facing a situation where Perpetual Treasuries and its associate companies, have given millions to fund the electoral campaigns of both UNP and SLFP Ministers. In fact, the poll campaign of one was given funds after the election was over! This raises major issues on the funding of the electoral process in this country, which must be a matter of major concern for a government, elected with the promise of electoral reforms.
There is now a clear case for the government to come out with a statement to Parliament, on all the facts available on this matter. The absence to do so will negatively affect the UNP, the larger party of government. This particularly because the Law and Order Ministry, and the Ministry of Justice have been held by members of the UNP since 2015. President Sirisena did make strong complaints at Cabinet meetings about the failure of these ministries to act on matters relating to the Rajapaksas.
It is also no secret that the Ministry of Defence too, under the President, has intervened with regard to cases in court on pro-Rajapaksa activists, especially in the armed forces.
The China Funding story is of importance in the context of the new laws necessary to update and give strength to the legislation governing electoral expenditure by candidates, in all aspects of polls in the country. With Proportional Polls at the District Level, introduced by J. R. Jayewardene in 1978, our electoral system is swept by corruption in every aspect of campaigning. There is little the Elections Commission could do, due to the prevailing laws, to curb the influence of corrupt funders of candidates and political parties in Sri Lankan elections.
The call for a clear and quick statement on this Chinese funding will come from sections of civil society concerned about the need for clean elections in the country. The level of corruption that prevails will not encourage any political parties to make a big call for Clean Elections.
The backbenchers of the UNP will have to make louder and stronger calls for an official exposure of the electoral corruption in the last presidential poll.
This is important in the context of the large scale of shelving, hiding or inaction on the many allegations of corruption of the Rajapaksa Regime, which was the stuff of the campaign in 2014, that saw the election of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe in January 2015.
The China Funding, if hidden away, in the context of emerging political alliances with sections of the government and opposition, will certainly be a political noose that will pull down all the future offers of clean government by those in yahapalanaya today.

Dejan Lovren:
A child refugee ... now he will play in the World Cup final
Its been 20 years since Croatia not only burst onto the World Cup scene, but also since they advanced beyond the group stages.
And as anticipation has grown each year as to whether Croatia's squad will finally meet the expectations set in France two decades ago, they finally proved themselves -- after a historic win against England during the semifinal on Wednesday.
It's the smallest country to reach the World Cup final since Uruguay in 1950, and now, Croatia faces its biggest challenge -- will the team finally be able to win the final against France and lift the World Cup trophy for the first time ever
Croatia's participation in Sunday's final will mark a remarkable staging post in the journey of one of its key players Dejan Lovren, who experienced life as a child refugee in the 1990s after fleeing war-torn Bosnia.
Even before the World Cup kicked off, the Liverpool defender seemed to think if any Croatian squad can, it's this one.
"We are a small country, only four million people and we have big talent in our squad," he told CNN Sport in an exclusive interview before the World Cup.
"You look at which payers (are) playing and (from what) teams, it's quite amazing."
Dominik Livakovic (Dinamo) and Filip Bradaric (Rijeka) are the only two members of Croatia's 23-man squad that play for Croatian clubs, with the other 21 stars having moved abroad to play for an assortment of leading European clubs.
Key to Croatia reaching the final has been the inspirational performances of Real Madrid's 32-year-old midfielder Luka Modric, who has not only lifted the Champions League trophy four times, but is the heartbeat of this Croatian team.
Then there's Barcelona midfielder Ivan Rakitic who boasts over 90 caps, as well as robust Juventus striker Mario Mandukic.
It was Mandukic who was the hero of Wednesday's dramatic extra-time win -- with his vital winning goal in the 109th minute breaking hearts around England and causing pandemonium on the streets of Zagreb.
"To be part of the World Cup is already an achievement," Lovren had said, "but we believe in our quality and we know that we if can get through the group stages we can go far."
That they did -- and now, thanks to Mandukic who ensured Croatia's fate -- they will face France in Moscow on Sunday.
'MY LIFE AS A REFUGEE'
Lovren has made a documentary for Liverpool's TV station in which he talks about his escape as a young child from war-torn Bosnia in 1992.
"I just remember when the sirens went on," said Lovren. "I was so scared because I was thinking 'bombs' or that something will happen now. "I remember my mum took me and we went to the basement, I don't know how long we'd been sitting there, I think it was until the sirens went off. Afterwards, I remember mum, my uncle, my uncle's wife, we took the car and then we were driving to Germany."
His family settled in Germany, but after seven years they were told to leave and had to start life again in Croatia.
Lovren's participation in Sunday's showpiece also complete remarkable turnaround for the Croatian defender after he endured an uncertain start to the 2017/2018 season with Liverpool. In an English Premier League game against Tottenham in October, he was substituted after 31 minutes with Liverpool losing 2-0 -- his side went on to lose 4-1 in a woeful performance at Wembley.
After the Spurs game, Lovren said he's received a "disgusting" death threat against his family on social media.
In an Instagram story, Lovren posted the private message which read: "I'm gonna murder ur family u Croatian p****."
The defender then wrote: "I don't mind when people talk s*** about me, it says more about them!
"But I cannot ignore when my family is threatened. I just can't and won't accept that."
In the early part of the 2017/2018 season the 29-year-old Croat also admitted to taking painkillers to get through some games.
"I have problems with my whole body for the last two weeks, my back and now I have hurt my Achilles tendon," Lovren told the Croatian paper Sportske Novosti.
"I am taking pills so I can play -- five before every game. I play but I cannot train at all. That's why I skipped matches against Manchester City and Burnley."
However, Lovren disputed the idea he had had a "difficult season" when he spoke to reporters after Croatia's win over England
"I took Liverpool to the final of the Champions League," added Lovren, referring to Liverpool's feats in reaching European football's showpiece final, before defeat to Real Madrid. "Now with my national team we are in the final.
"I think people should recognize that I am also one of the best defenders in the world and not just talk nonsense."
Lovren joined Liverpool in July 2014 in a $26.5 million transfer from Southampton.  CNN

Corporal Gamini Kularathne, a hero of our times - Dr. Assaji Thera
Ven Dr.Kirinde Assaji Thera said yesterday that Lance Corporal Gamini Kularathne popularly known as Hasalaka Gamini, who sacrificed his life to save his comrades during the terrorist intrusion at Elephant Pass Camp is an exemplary hero for all security forces personnel in the country.
It was due to the supreme sacrifice made by Lance Corporal Gamini Kularathne, that the Army camp and the lives of thousands of war heroes were protected when the LTTE sieged the Elephant Pass camp in July 1991.
Ven Dr.Kirinde Assaji Thera addressing the 27th death anniversary ceremony of Corporal Gamini Kularathne said he made this ultimate sacrifice on his own without any fear or compulsion from senior officers.
The one and only honest feeling he had that time was protecting lives of his fellow soldiers and the camp, the thera said at the ceremony held at the Sri Lanka Tourist Board auditorium in Colombo yesterday.
That is why, that Lance Corporal Kularathne was awarded with the highest military decoration, the Parama Weera Vibhushanaya, (PWV) for his act of bravery.
We had suffered immensely due to the 30 year long war and no one can forget the cruelty of the war. We must appreciate this noble sacrifice, Ven. Thera said.

Vijayakalas controversial statement :
COURT CALLS FOR SINHALA, TAMIL TRANSCRIPTS
The Colombo Chief Magistrates Court yesterday issued an order directing the Department of Official Languages to provide the Sinhala and Tamil transcripts of the video footage pertaining to the alleged offensive statement made by former State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran regarding the resurgence of the LTTE at a public gathering held in Jaffna.
Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made this order pursuant to a request made by the Organised Crimes Prevention Division. Filing a motion in Court, the Organised Crimes Prevention Division informed that two TV channels, DAN TV and Hiru TV had already handed over the video footage pertaining to the statement to the Police. In order to carry out further investigations into the incident, it is required to have the Sinhala and Tamil transcripts of the video footage, police informed court.
On July 6, the Chief Magistrates Court issued an order directing several media institutions to produce their unedited video footage and paper articles pertaining to this controversial statement.
Filing a B report regarding this incident, the Organized Crimes Prevention Division alleged that the former State Minister could be charged under the offences that appears to have been committed under Section 115 and 120 of the Penal Code, violating the provisions of the Prevention of Terrorism Act and provisions stipulated under Article 157A of the Constitution.

Croatias World Cup success  divides Balkan neighbours
BELGRADE, Serbia, Thursday: Croatias neighbours in the former Yugoslavia have largely praised the teams surprise success in reaching the World Cup final in Russia -- just dont expect the Serbian president to support them, at least for now.
Every time a major tournament comes around, a familiar refrain is heard in the region: If only Yugoslavia was one country, imagine the amazing team we could have.
That nostalgic lament hides the fact that Croatia are doing just fine without Bosnian or Serb players -- and Yugoslavia, after all, never reached a World Cup final.
If one man embodies football and the dream of a multi-cultural Yugoslavia, it is Ivica Osim, the coach of the last Yugoslavia team before the country violently broke apart.
He was in charge of a superb team at the 1990 World Cup in Italy that was knocked out at the quarter-final stage in a penalty shootout by Diego Maradonas Argentina.
When Serb forces began bombing the city, Osim, barely holding back the tears, told Serb journalists that he hoped they would remember that I come from Sarajevo.
Now 77, the Bosnian has watched Croatia and midfield maestro Luka Modrics run to Sundays final against France with huge admiration.
They have managed to integrate their individual qualities into the collective and never give up even when they are exhausted, he told the Jutarnji List newspaper, adding that this is not a common trait with us.
PLAIN JERSEYS
In a region still scarred by the conflicts of the 1990s in which 130,000 people died, many people find it hard to throw their support behind Croatia despite a common language and culture. That is especially the case in Serbia, whose team failed to qualify for the knock-out stages of the World Cup. In early June, a mini-World Cup was organised for children attending football schools in Belgrade. Each team wore the colours of one of the 32 qualified teams -- except the team representing Croatia. To avoid offending any Serbian sensitivities, the children in that team had to wear blank white t-shirts.
Novak Djokovic is Serbias best-known sportsman and an idol in his country, but when the 12-time Grand Slam winner voiced support for the Croatia World Cup team, he was condemned by Vladimir Djukanovic, a lawmaker from the ruling Serbian Progressive Party. Only idiots can support Croatia. Arent you ashamed Novak Djukanovic tweeted.
His argument was that Djokovic has wide support from Serbs in Krajina, a region of Croatia where Serbs were in the majority before they were driven out during the war.
Serbian President Aleksandar Vucic made no secret of which team he backed in Croatias World Cup quarter-final against host nation Russia.
I supported Russia, that is my right. Serbia is a democratic society and everyone has the right to support whoever they want, Vucic said.
WELL DONE NEIGHBOURS!
That opinion is by no means shared by everyone. Many Serbs have expressed admiration, and sometimes even outright joy, at Croatias success.
Congratulations with all my heart, bravo!, Miodrag, a resident of Nis in southern Serbia told the website of Serbian state TV on Wednesday after the semi-final win over England. Our players and the (Serbian) federation could maybe ask the Croats to give us football lessons, someone else commented.
Milojko Pantic, a well-known sports commentator when Yugoslavia was still a single country, said that Serbs with a sense of brotherliness had supported Croatia in the quarter-finals while those who wanted to see Russia beat Croatia were bigots and nationalists.
In Macedonia, most residents are supporting Croatia, despite the nationalist rights unswerving support for Russia.
Congratulations Croatia. Politics, sport, the region and the world have all come together tonight, Macedonian Prime Minister Zoran Zaev tweeted along with a photo of himself and Croatian President Kolinda Grabar-Kitarovic at a NATO summit.
Politics aside, hats off to you, neighbours! You are the pride of the former Yugoslavia, said an unnamed Montenegro on the website of the Vijesti newspaper. Around 6,000 Croats live in Montenegro.  AFP

Dejected England, Belgium aim  to leave World Cup on a high
SAINT PETERSBURG, Russia, Thursday: England manager Gareth Southgate admits the World Cup third-place play-off is a game that no team wants to play, but Saturdays match against Belgium offers the chance to finish the tournament on a winning note.
A gut-wrenching 2-1 loss to Croatia after extra-time denied England a shot at a second World Cup triumph, instead setting up a consolation game against familiar foes Belgium.
Roberto Martinezs side, who were beaten 1-0 by France in the last four, topped Group G ahead of England after an Adnan Januzaj goal settled a low-key encounter in Kaliningrad.
That game saw both coaches heavily rotate their teams, and a similar scenario is likely in Saint Petersburg, with several fringe players pushing for a start.
The honest thing is, its not a game any team wants to play in, said Southgate, whose side have drawn praise for the way they have briefly united a country bitterly divided over Brexit.
However, he insisted that will not alter Englands approach as they look to achieve their best finish since they won the competition in 1966.
Well want to give a performance of huge pride, theres no question about that, said Southgate.
Every time we wear the shirt of our national team we want to play with pride, we want to play well and we want to win.
Reserve goalkeepers Jack Butland and Nick Pope are the only two members of Englands 23-man squad yet to feature in Russia, as Southgate stuck with the same line-up throughout the knockout phase.
IMPORTANT GAME
For Belgium and their golden generation, many of the key players should return for the 2022 World Cup, even if Vincent Kompany and Jan Vertonghen will probably be gone by then.
Martinez, who signed an extension until after Euro 2020 in May, can guide Belgium to the nations best result at the World Cup. They finished fourth in 1986.
We want to finish on a high and these players deserve to finish on a high, said the Spaniard.
You need to try to see the opportunity of finishing third at the World Cup. That doesnt happen too often, so we need to understand that this is an important game. But I would accept it is very difficult when you had the ambition of getting to the final. Its very difficult to prepare for the next game.
European teams have claimed third place at the past nine World Cups. The Netherlands beat Brazil 3-0 in 2014 after the hosts were embarrassed 7-1 by Germany in the semi-finals.
England skipper Harry Kane is the tournaments top scorer on six goals, while Belgium striker Romelu Lukaku trails by two in the race for the Golden Boot.
With one more goal Kane would become the highest scorer at the competition since 2002, when Ronaldo struck eight times, including twice in the final, as Brazil clinched a record fifth title.
The Tottenham forward would be just the second England player to scoop the award, after Gary Lineker was the top scorer in 1986.  AFP

Dengue fever ailed 27,591 people and killed around 25 up to July 13, Epidemiology Unit sources said.
The Colombo District reported the highest number (4,935) and the Batticaloa District recorded the second highest (3,751). The Gampaha District recorded the third highest, (2,457), the sources said.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,324 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 3,611 dengue cases. The Western Province recorded 69,060 cases, the unit sources said.
The public are advised to seek treatment without delay for fever. Fever patients need rest and should not attend work or school.
They should take paracetamol only. Other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites (water harbouring places) during this rainy season to prevent dengue. Even water in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, the sources said.

The FCID had filed a B report before Fort Magistrates Court against Namal Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.70 million granted by Indian Real Estate Company Krish Lanka Pvt. Ltd, for the development of rugby in Sri Lanka. He is currently out on bail.
The case will be taken up again on October 26.
The FCID alleged that Krish Lanka Pvt. Ltd had granted Rs.70 million for the development of rugby in Sri Lanka and the amount was given to Ceylon Premium Sports President Nihal Hemasiri Perera.
The FCID said Krish Company had remitted the money to a HSBC bank account belonging to Nihal Hemasiri Perera and he had later given the money to Rajapaksa on two occasions. The FCID alleged that the complaint by Wasantha Samarasinghe had alleged that the money granted by Krish Company had been misappropriated by the suspect without utilising them for the real purpose of the company. Counsel Sampath Mendis appeared for the defence.

A fine measure
Our roads are among the deadliest in the world, with around eight deaths reported daily. While bus drivers and three wheeler drivers are the biggest culprits, pedestrians, cyclists, motorcyclists and other motorists also contribute to the grim statistics. There are a variety of causes for the high accident rate, but the leading one is reckless driving. This is what leads to most avoidable accidents, as opposed to certain accidents that cannot be prevented, for example those occurring due to bad weather and road conditions. Speeding, Driving Under the Influence (DUI), driving without proper training, driving under extreme fatigue and using mechanically unsound vehicles are among the other causes.
The State has imposed fines for many traffic offences, but some of the fines are so minimal that most motorists do not mind paying the fine and carrying on regardless. In other words, the fines do not act as a deterrent. The Government has now decided to increase fines for many traffic offences while adding 10 new offences from next week, making a total of 33. Fines for additional offences had been amended to Rs.1,000 as a minimum and a maximum of Rs.3,000. The fine for breaking speed limits has been increased to Rs.3,000. Fines going up to Rs.25,000 for seven traffic offences including DUI will be added as spot fines after Cabinet approval is received.
This is a welcome move, but only time will tell whether even the enhanced fines will work. In another development, Civil Aviation and Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva has opined that life imprisonment sentence should be given to punish reckless drivers, especially those who cause very serious or fatal accidents. This is a valuable suggestion that should be looked into.
The authorities have also addressed another pertinent problem  overloading. This is common in three wheelers and private buses, but we have seen four people riding on a motorcycle and plenty of instances when private motor cars carry more than five passengers. We have also seen trucks carrying workers to various sites and in most instances, there is no safety net or barrier in the event of a collision. The fines for overloading of passengers and goods should cover all vehicle categories. Overloading is a serious offence, because it fundamentally alters the handling characteristics of the vehicle. A vehicle that carries more than the stipulated weight has a greater chance of getting out of control and meeting with an accident.
However, the mention of carriage of goods other than personal luggage as an offence is not very clear. Unless the goods are not contraband (illegal drugs, kasippu, game meat etc.) or illegal to be transported without a permit (explosives, cattle, timber, sand etc.), there is no reason why the Police should look into the luggage transported in personal vehicles. For example, should a bag of cement in someones trunk be considered illegal The authorities must clarify clearly what kind of goods may not be transported in personal vehicles to clear this confusion. Likewise, there is an offence related to not taking precautions when refuelling but it is unclear whether Police can enter and nab motorists in a filling station, which is essentially private property. But the public can be educated on the steps that should be taken while refulleing, including turning the engine off, not using cellular phones, not using bottles to refuel on the road, and not smoking. There has always been a prohibition on buses refuelling with passengers on board for safety reasons and the Police can nab the drivers once they come out of the filling station.
The Police must also stop the practice of hiding behind bushes and trees and suddenly springing onto the road to nab motorists. This is quite dangerous, because some drivers may not be able to stop their vehicles in time. It is a matter of simple biology and physics  once a police officer gives the stop signal, it has to register in the drivers brain, which has to issue a command to brake. All this takes a few seconds, while the vehicle is still moving. Generally, if a vehicle travelling at 70 Km/h is requested to stop on a dry road, the car goes around 30 metres by the time the driver reacts to the signal. Once the brakes are applied, the car still travels another 25-30 metres before the wheels stop turning. Thus if a police officer jumps in front of a vehicle moving at that speed from just 40 metres away, the driver may not be able to stop in time. Several Police officers have already died this way, but so far this practice has not stopped.
We also hope that bigger formal incentives will be given to traffic police officers, so that they will not be tempted to receive informal incentives from motorists. Remember, these fines are not just a form of revenue collection, but rather a way to deter motorists from committing offences in the future. The main role of the Police should be creating awareness and educating motorists, not collecting fines per se.

MR upto his old tricks again - Finance Minister:
Fuel price increase in accordance with formula
Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksa is once again up to his old tricks of twisting facts to mislead the people, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said yesterday.
A media briefing held at the Finance Ministry had the Minister and State Minister Eran Wickramaratne explain the recent fuel price increase in the wake of allegations from Rajapaksa who said the government was manipulating fuel prices for its own benefits. Minister Samaraweera explained that the recent increase was done in accordance with the fuel pricing formula introduced in March this year and the current prices were still less than in 2014.
In 2014, Octane 92 was priced at Rs 150 per litre but current prices stand at Rs 145 per litre.
The pricing formula will capture the price fluctuations of crude oil and the dollar rate, giving benefits to the people, Samaraweera said. During the Rajapaksa regime when a barrel of crude oil was at USD 98, they sold petrol at Rs 157, when it came down to USD 68 they sold at Rs 150, when at USD 46 at Rs 150 and by 2014 when it was USD 55, petrol was still being sold at Rs.150.
Even when it came to the SLR-USD exchange rate, when Mahinda Rajapaksa assumed power it was at Rs 100.50 to the dollar and when he left it was Rs 135.91 to the dollar, he added.
This was how Mahinda Rajapaksa did not give the benefits of oil reductions to the people, he said. He stressed that fuel prices remained inflated also because of the Hedging Deal which cost the tax payer Rs 10.2 billion, I have ordered several investigations into former Central Bank Governor Nivard Cabraal in this matter and will reveal all soon. Even a Supreme Court Order asking that prices be reduced during the Rajapaksa regime was ignored, the Minister said. State Minister Wickramaratne explained that the fuel pricing formula which will revise prices on the tenth of every month will ensure a proper system, international price of crude oil (Singapore Platts rate), value of the rupee, distribution costs and percentage of tax on fuel would also be taken into consideration in the costing.

Kuldeep waits on Test call after white-ball wickets against England
NOTTINGHAM, Thursday - Kuldeep Yadav hopes his recent limited-overs performances will prompt Indias selectors to include him in their squad for the upcoming Test series in England.
The left-arm wrist spinner took a superb one-day international best six for 25 in his maximum 10 overs as India beat England by eight wickets at Trent Bridge on Thursday to go 1-0 up in a three-match series.
That followed the 23-year-olds five for 24 in the first Twenty20 international against England at Old Trafford on July 3 -- a series India won 2-1.
His latest haul -- the best by any spinner in an ODI against England -- helped India dismiss the hosts for 268 in Nottingham, with opener Rohit Sharma then making 137 not out as the tourists won with nearly 10 overs remaining.
Left-arm wrist spinners are a rarity in top-level cricket and Englands batsmen are struggling to pick which way Yadav is turning the ball.
After the one-dayers, India remain in England for a five-Test series.
With Britain, by its standards, experiencing something of a heatwave, pitches around the country are dry and receptive to spin, rather than the traditional green surfaces beloved of seam bowlers.
Yadavs recent success, allied to favourable conditions, has led to suggestions he could be included in the Test squad due to be announced by Indias selectors over the weekend.
In recent times India have tended to deploy the experienced pair of off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin and left-arm orthodox Ravindra Jadeja as their specialist slow bowlers in the five-day game.
But as he reflected on his heroics at Trent Bridge, Yadav made it clear he wanted to add to his tally of nine wickets in two Tests -- the last against Sri Lanka in Pallekele in August 2017.
I bowled wicket to wicket and tried to vary my pace, he said. Talking about Test cricket, I am hoping for the call and lets see what happens in a couple days when they announce the Test team.
Englands top three batsmen were in devastating form during a preceding 5-0 series rout of Australia last month -- which included a mens ODI record total of 481 for six at Trent Bridge on June 19.
But on Thursday, albeit with opener Alex Hales missing with a side injury that has ruled him out of the entire series, Yadav removed an England top three of Jason Roy, Test skipper Joe Root and Jonny Bairstow in a stunning spell of three wickets for five runs in 10 balls.
It doesnt matter to me because I never bowl looking at who the batsman is, explained Yadav.
In my mind, I am only thinking about how I can contribute to the team, he added.
HUGE PROBLEM
England have used a specialist bowling machine in a bid to help them prepare for the challenge of facing Yadav, but the bowler himself was unimpressed.
With a bowling machine, you cannot see the hand or wrist or arm during delivery and the ball only turns, he said.
So if you are not picking the ball (from the hand), then there is a huge problem.
Ben Stokes (50) and Jos Buttler (53) prevented complete collapse during a fifth-wicket stand of 93 but they too fell to Yadav.
England, the 2019 World Cup hosts, dont have much time to come up with a new plan for Yadav ahead of Saturdays second ODI at Lords and skipper Eoin Morgan admitted: He is very good and there is no getting around that.
He exposes an area of our game we need to improve on, that is a healthy thing, the Irishman added.
Its a chance to improve in this area, however long it takes, between now and the World Cup.
Meanwhile Morgan tried to put Englands struggles against Yadav into perspective by saying: Considering there is only one left-arm Chinaman (a left-arm wrist-spinner) bowler in the world it is not a huge concern.  AFP

Mangala abides by Cabinet decision ON Death penalty
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said whilst he opposed the Death Penalty on principle, he would abide by the collective decision of the Cabinet.
Addressing a media briefing, the Minister answered questions with regard to his stance on the Death Penalty.
I have always been against the Death Penalty and my stance has not changed. Even within the Cabinet, I voiced by opinion but the majority was for it, he said.
The Minister further explained that there was no evidence of crime rates falling in the presence of the Death Penalty. He stressed that countries which implemented the Death Penalty continued to face the scourge of drugs. The best solution to this is to enforce the law to the letter. I would also like to ask whether we can in reality apprehend the large scale drug lords even with the death penalty, he said.
Further, he said that drug addicts and dealers could not be placed in the same category and whilst the law has to be enforced on the latter, it was rehabilitation and not imprisonment that was important for the former.
We need more rehabilitation centres in the country. We should not be sending addicts to prison.
The Minister was of the opinion that life imprisonment for drug dealers was a greater punishment than death, It would kill him a little every day instead of putting him out of his misery.

Manila welcomes Sri Lankas war on drugs
MANILA  Malacaang on Thursday lauded the government of Sri Lanka for its plan to replicate the success of the Philippines war on drugs.
Presidential Spokesperson Harry Roque made this reaction after Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena has recognized Philippines successful approach against illegal drugs.
Of course, we are happy that other countries have taken note of our war on drugs, and that they look upon us as best practice on dealing with illegal drugs, Roque said in a Palace press briefing.
So we appreciate that, but as of now, we still have no death penalty, he added.
According to media reports, the government of Sri Lanka will begin hanging drug dealers to replicate success of Philippines.
Sirisena said he was ready to sign the death warrants of repeat drug offenders after nearly 50 years of moratorium on executions.
I think, we have not reached that point that will hang them. We are still on the level of really using our police, PDEA and NBI and our political will against drug pushers, Roque said.
In the Philippines, the war on drugs is being implemented by the Philippine National Police, Philippine Drug Enforcement Agency and the National Bureau of Investigation.

One of us will have to play an innings like Karunaratne  Amla
GALLE, Friday: South Africas most experienced batsman and former captain Hashim Amla said that one of the batters in the side has to play an innings like Dimuth Karunaratne for them to have any chance of winning or saving the first Test against Sri Lanka played at the Galle International Stadium.
South Africa find themselves on the back foot after being bowled out for their lowest total against Sri Lanka  126 and trail the hosts by 272 runs at the end of the second day.
272 on that type of wicket is a lot of runs. If we manage to restrict them to say 320, then certainly that would be a good target for us.
If a couple of us have a good partnership and one of us plays like the way Karunaratne played, that would get us close to that score, said Amla at the end of the day.
On a difficult wicket Karunaratne has proved to be the most successful batsman from both sides scoring 158 not out in the first innings and following it up with 60 in the second.
The next highest score in the match so far is South African captain Faf du Plessis knock of 49.
Amla said that as one of the top order batsmen he had a big role to play in the second innings. Any of the batsmen in the top six would like to occupy the crease for a long time and get us close to the total we have to chase. We want to get stuck in and bat for as long as possible, said Amla. As weve seen its been a tough pitch for both teams. When we bowled in the first innings their opener batted exceptionally well.
Karunaratne played an excellent knock, which basically got them the score they got to. Its a tough wicket. Youve got to try and capitalise on the loose balls when you do get them. And certainly hope that the ball doesnt have your name on it - caught behind, or whatever the case is. Youve always got to have intent when youre batting, he said.
Youve got to have a decent defence to keep out the good ball, and youve got to look to score. If you can combine those two with a bit of fortune here and there, that gives you the best chance.
DILRUWAN  SOUTH AFRICAS NEMESIS
As he had performed four years ago, Dilruwan Perera was again proving to be South Africas main adversary capturing four wickets for 46 as their batsmen crumbled against spin.
In the 2014 series against them Perera took 16 wickets (avg. 23.12) in two Tests to win the Man of the Series award so what so special against South Africa There is nothing special as such. But we have realized that South Africa dont play off-spin too well.
That has been evident in their last few series. Maybe that is one reason why I have been successful against them, said Perera.
We were trying not to let the batsmen settle. You have to keep changing the angles and Rangana (Herath) even changed ends.
If the wicket is turning, I tend to change those angles, he said.
Perera said Sri Lanka didnt expect to get South Africa out so cheaply in the first innings.
We wanted to take a lead. We stopped easy runs put pressure and got the wickets early. Things went on pretty well I thought. We didnt expect to get them bowled out for 126, said Perera.
When the ball is new, the ball pitches and turns a lot and when it gets softer it stops turning.
Thats why we decided to stick to the spinners in the morning.
Commenting on the state of play Perera said: It is still the second day of the match. It is not the usual Galle wicket.
It spins from one area only and not like what the usual Galle wicket provides. We have three more days and it will deteriorate further I feel.

The other World Cup (Rugby) selling out fast
The FIFA World Cup is reaching boiling point ahead of Sundays final, but that hasnt stopped widespread interest in another World Cup taking place next year.
Theres been unprecedented interest in tickets for the 2019 Rugby World Cup in Japan, with 2.5 million applications made for tickets to date, some 700,000 more than the initial target set by organizers. By contrast, FIFA announced a week before the start of Russia 2018 that just over 2.4 million tickets had been allocated to fans. Empty seats were seen at many of the games early on in the tournament.
The response from both Japanese and international rugby fans has been truly amazing, said Akira Shimazu, president of the organizing committee. Weve seen incredible interest in matches featuring the host nation Japan, top-tier nations New Zealand, Ireland, Australia and England, as well as tremendous demand right across the knockout stages.
The tournament, which kicks off in September 2019, is the first to be held in Asia and the first to be hosted outside a Tier One nation.
Previous editions have been staged in New Zealand, Australia, South Africa, France, and the UK.
It is expected that 400,000 fans will travel to Japan, where 48 matches will be played across 12 venues.
With priority ballot sales now closed, the next opportunity for fans to secure tickets is on September 19, a year to the day before the tournament gets underway.
My message to those fans who have not yet been successful is to apply again in September 2018 when the next ballot phase opens, said Shimazu.
There are still plenty of great tickets available and we want to ensure that we welcome as many fans as possible to this once-in-a-lifetime tournament.
The All Blacks are favorites to win a third successive World Cup in Japan and have recently enjoyed a 3-0 series victory over France.
Ireland, however, has the best chance to win its first ever title having claimed a 2-1 series victory over Australia last month.  CNN

Proteas spun out for lowest total - 126:
Spinners put Sri Lanka in command
GALLE, Friday: South Africas technique to survive against spin in the subcontinent was exposed to the hilt when they succumbed to their lowest total against Sri Lanka being bowled out for 126 in their first innings on the second day of the first Test played at the Galle International Stadium yesterday.
Sri Lanka with a handy first innings lead of 161 extended it to 272 by the close finishing on 111-4 with Angelo Mathews (14) and Roshen Silva (10) at the wickets. Sri Lanka scored 287 in the first innings. Dimuth Karunaratne followed his first innings unbeaten innings of 158 with another superb effort scoring 60 off 80 balls (7 fours) and figuring in an opening partnership of 51 with Danushka Gunathilaka who was out for 17 providing left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj the first of three wickets he captured in the Lankan second innings.
Maharaj who went wicketless found appreciable turn on the second day pitch to end with figures of three for 37 off 16 overs.
What his success meant to his team was how the Galle pitch was behaving and how difficult a task the batsmen will face in surviving on it when their turn comes to bat in the second innings.
The Proteas were all at sea against the three-pronged Sri Lanka spin attack headed by veteran spinner Rangana Herath and comprising Dilruwan Perera and Lakshan Sandakan. These three bowlers sent down 50 of the 54.3 overs during the South African innings.
The remaining 4.3 overs were bowled by acting skipper and fast bowler Suranga Lakmal who snapped up three late wickets including that of his vis-a-vis Faf du Plessis who top scored with 49 off 88 balls (5 fours) to finish with 3 for 21.
The morning session however was dominated by the Lankan spin trio as they made early inroads into the strong South African batting.
What caused the South Africans downfall was their batsmens poor technique against spin than what the pitch had to offer.
Except for the odd ball that tended to keep low there were no demons on the pitch for South Africa to be dismissed for such a low score. It was their lowest ever total against Sri Lanka the previous one being 168 in Durban in 2011.
Herath started the South African collapse by sending back nightwatchman Maharaj trapping him lbw for 3 off the third over of the day.
From there onwards it was a procession of batsmen getting out as Perera and Sandakan also got into the act. South Africa collapsed to 51-6 and looked in danger of being bowled out for less than 100.
But du Plessis found some support from Vernon Philander who hung around for 95 minutes to help his captain raise the total by 64 in a seventh wicket stand before falling lbw to Perera for 18.
At the same score 115 Du Plessiss gallant innings was ended by Lakmal who had put himself on to bowl when the partnership was beginning to flourish.
He not only sent back Du Plessis but cleaned up the tail by dismissing Rabada and Steyn.
The three Lankan spinners complimented each other with Herath finishing with 2 for 39, Perera 4 for 46 and Sandakan 1 for 18.

STF foil attempt to murder wife of prison inmate
Police Special Task Force officers had arrested five suspects over a plot to kill the wife of a Welikada Prison inmate, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Based on a tip-off received by the Organised Crimes Division that a plan was being hatched to kill the wife of a prison inmate when she returns after visiting him in prison, STF officers clad in civils had been on the alert around the Welikada prison area.
Being suspicious about a person who was at the bus stand opposite the Welikada prison, STF officers had made their way towards him without raising suspicion.They had paid attention to a phone conversation he was having at the time and it helped them confirm that he had some connection with the plot. The suspect was then arrested and a motorcycle belonging to him parked in the vicinity was taken into police custody.The arrested suspect was identified as 22-year-old Nilwala Kankanamlage Lahiru Pramodya Perera, a resident of Kaduwela.
The STF had also retrieved a live hand grenade in his possession.
Upon interrogation, another suspect who had come with the arrested suspect was also apprehended when he was coming out of the Welikada Prison. He has been identified as 23-year-old Ruwan Pathiranage Sajith Viduranga, a resident of Udawapitigama, Malwana.
Based on information gathered by the two arrested suspects, the STF had tried to search a trishaw that was parked nearby, but when they saw the police approaching them, they had sped towards Dematagoda.STF officers had given chase and arrested three more suspects including the trishaw driver near the Dematagoda flyover.
The three arrested suspects who were in the trishaw were the trishaw driver 25-year-old Johnson Amila 24-year-old Sam Abeysooriyage Kelum Kumara and 27-year-old Velupani Ravi.All of them are residents of Mattakkuliya. The STF had recovered 2 grams and 610 milligrams of heroin from their possession. The STF had also taken into custody a sharp manna knife, the trishaw, the motorcycle fitted with a fake number plate, several mobile phones and a live hand grenade, from the suspects.
The STF determined that this was a premeditated plan to commit the murder. Investigations had also revealed that this murder plot had been planned by several prison inmates currently being held at the Welikada prison.The suspects had been handed over to the Organised Crime Division for further interrogation.

Suwaseriya service to benefit Northerners
The 1990 Suwaseriya ambulance service will be initiated in the Northern Province on July 21, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said.
He pointed out that 1,061,315 million people in the North will receive pre-hospital care ambulance services and emergency response services free of charge with this move.
The State Minister said the service would also be extended to the Eastern Province before the end of this year.
The Suwaseriya Foundation was set up by way of a Parliamentary Act with the aim to expand the 1990 Suwaseriya service to cover the whole country.
Supported by India, the 1990 Suwaseriya service was launched in the Western Province in July 2016 and later expanded to the Southern Province. It provides immediate and effective pre-hospital care free of charge in a safe and clinical working environment until a person reaches the nearest healthcare provider.
The state minister addressing Parliament last month said the Suwaseriya ambulance service had received 584,520 emergency calls since its inception.
He said 88,599 ambulances had been dispatched in response to emergency calls received to the 1990 Hotline. On average, 12.58 minutes had been taken to transport a patient to hospital.
The State Minister said new staff is being recruited and trained to launch the Suwaseriya service island wide.

Trump blasts May's Brexit strategy
UK: Donald Trump issued scathing criticism of Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit strategy during his visit to Britain, as campaigners planned a mass protest against the US president on Friday.
In a series of extraordinary broadsides, Trump told Friday's edition of The Sun that May's plan for post-Brexit ties with the EU would probably kill the prospects for a trade deal with the US.
Trump also said former Foreign Minister Boris Johnson, who resigned this week in protest over the plan, would make a great prime minister.
He said London Mayor Sadiq Khan, who has allowed protesters to raise a giant diaper-clad balloon mocking the US president next to parliament on Friday, was doing a terrible job on crime.
The comments will plunge the transatlantic special relationship to new lows, making for extremely awkward talks with May when the two meet at her country retreat of Chequers later on Friday.
As he began a four-day visit to Britain on Thursday, Trump, a major supporter of Brexit, told The Sun that he had advised May to go about leaving the EU in a different way but was ignored.
I would have done it much differently. I actually told Theresa May how to do it but she didn't agree, she didn't listen to me. She wanted to go a different route.
I would actually say that she probably went the opposite way. And that is fine. She should negotiate the best way she knows how. But it is too bad what is going on, he told the tabloid, Britain's best-selling newspaper. Referring to the Brexit blueprint, which was outlined by the government on Thursday, he said: The deal she is striking is a much different deal than the one the people voted on.
It was not the deal that was in the referendum. I have just been hearing this over the last three days. I know they have had a lot of resignations. So a lot of people don't like it, he said. May is facing a rebellion by Brexit hardliners over the proposals, including the resignation of Johnson and Brexit Minister David Davis this week, although moderates and big businesses have been supportive.
May has insisted that her Brexit plan will allow Britain to strike its own lucrative trade deals with countries like the US after her country has left the bloc as planned in March next year.
She pressed Trump about the deal on Thursday at a gala dinner at Blenheim Palace, the birthplace of Britain's World War II leader Winston Churchill.
Brexit creates an opportunity to reach a free trade agreement that creates jobs and growth here in the UK and right across the United States, she said.
But Trump poured cold water on May's offer.
If they do a deal like that, we would be dealing with the European Union instead of dealing with the UK, so it will probably kill the deal, he said.
Trump flew into Britain on Thursday, having already subjected NATO allies to a roasting over their levels of defence spending.
The president spent the night at the US ambassador's residence located in a London park behind a ring of steel fencing, stalked by noisy demonstrators.
White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders later told reporters Trump was thankful for the wonderful welcome he received in Britain.
The President likes and respects Prime Minister May very much. As he said in his interview with the Sun she 'is a very good person' and he 'never said anything bad about her', she said. - AFP

Use of SPC funds to pay mobile phone bill: Case against Keheliya re-fixed for trial
A corruption case filed against former Minister Keheliya Rambukwella and former State Printing Corporation (SPC) Chairman was yesterday fixed for trial on October 16 by the Colombo Chief Magistrate's Court.
This is for allegedly causing an unlawful loss of Rs.230,984 to the government after paying former Ministers one month mobile phone bill using SPC funds, while functioning as the Mass Media Minister in 2012.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the court was informed that the first witness in the case was yet to receive notices.
Accordingly, the notices were re-issued on the witness to appear in courts on next trial date by Chief Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake.
On a previous occasion, the court had rejected the preliminary objections raised by defence and decided to fix the matter for trial.
The Bribery Commission alleged that the former minister had induced the CPC Chairman to pay his mobile phone bill from March 15, 2012 to April 14, 2012 causing an unlawful loss to the government while the former minister was serving as the Mass Media Minister.
The Bribery Commission had named former (SPC) Chairman Jayampathi Bandara Heenkenda as an accused for aiding and abetting to commit the offence.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption filed the case against former minister and the former SPC chairman under section 70 of the Bribery Act on three counts.
Counsel Anuradha Siriwardena, the Assistant Legal Director of Bribery Commission, appeared for the prosecution. Counsel Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the defence.

World FDI flows drop sharply
In 2017 global Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) flows fell sharply by 23 percent to US $ 1.43 trillion from 1.87 trillion in 2016.This significant drop was marked especially in developed and transitional economies with relative stability in the developing economies.
As a result the developing economies increased their share of the total global FDI to 47 percent in 2017 from 36 percent in 2016. Flows to developed countries fell by over one-third to US $ 172 billion. The drop in flows to the United States was 40 percent while the drop in flows to the UK was 92 percent.
Of the developing countries only flows to Africa declined. Flows to Asia remained stable and Latin America and the Caribbean region showed a modest 8 percent growth.
The United States remains the largest recipient of FDI with US $ 275 billion investment, followed by China with US $ 136 billion. Germany, France and Indonesia have also increased FDI inflows.
Developed countries also lead in FDI outflows. The United States, the United Kingdom, Netherlands, Hong Kong, Germany, Canada are among the countries from which most FDI flow out besides China which is the second largest supplier of FDI after the United States.
In the meantime the rate of return on FDI also declined during the last 5 years. In 2017 it fell by 6.7 percent. This affects the developing countries most as FDI amounts to 39percent of their incoming finance. The situation is worse in Least Developed Countries (LDCs) where FDI fell by 17 percent in 2017.
Today Asia is the largest recipient of FDI. In 2017 it received 33 percent of total FDI in contrast to 25 percent it received in 2016.
According to UNCTAD 65 countries have revised their investment policy measures. They have 93 new policies favouring liberalization and promotion of foreign investments.
NATO Summit achieves nothing new
The 29 nation summit of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) which met in Brussels from July 11-12 ended with no significant new achievements. Instead it has been unable to agree on President Trumps call for doubling the military expenses to 4 percent of the GDP of member countries.
However, President Trump insists that was a decision arrived at the summit. The joint communique signed by all leaders including President Trump said that members agreed to commit themselves to the earlier decision to increase military spending for NATO to 2 percent of the GDP by 2024. President Trump, on the other hand, insists that it should be done by January 2019, a deadline other leaders may not agree. In fact, leaders of France and Germany have already said so. President Trump has also hinted that in case his call to double military spending is not heeded the United Sates would consider withdrawing from the organisation.
This is in line with his election pledge of putting America First. However, it would need a two-thirds vote in the Congress which is unlikely given the opposition of the Democrats to the withdrawal.
President Trump says that the United States bears 90 percent of NATO military spending while Germany denies it. It says not all that expenditure is related to NATO and the actual NATO expenditure by the US is 67 percent of military costs of the Alliance.
In any case the leaders have agreed to increase military spending for NATO according to the previous decision and the target date. Thus the NATO remains a divided family as before despite a show of unity.
Theresa Mays Brexit worries
British Prime Minister Theresa May faced a mini-crisis when her Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Brexit-Secretary David Davis quit the Government over disagreement with Prime Minister Theresa Mays Brexit Plan titled The Future Relationship Between the United Kingdom and the European Union.
According to the results of the Referendum held on June 23, 2016 a majority of voters  51.9 percent opted to leave the European Union. Britain invoked Article 50 of the European Union to withdraw which gave it a two year period for negotiations which ends on March 29, 2018 with or without an agreement. A further transition period will be there till December 31, 2020 to finalize all procedures.
The EU Council will meet on October 18 to ratify the exit deal, failing which a fallout date of December 13 has been named for final ratification.
Prime Minister Theresa May is facing opposition from her own party in addition to the Labor party opposition. It is doubtful whether Parliament would approve the Prime Ministers Brexit deal.
Even if it is passed the final agreement approved by the EU would have to be approved by Parliament and it remains to be seen how the PS would vote for it. Theresa's Brexit worries are not going to be over soon.

A-Z of the 2018 World Cup
MOSCOW, Thursday: A-Z review of the 2018 World Cup.
A - Africa. For the first time since 1982 no African teams made it to the knockout stage. Egypt and Tunisia never got close, Morocco were a bit unlucky, while Nigeria and Senegal were a matter of minutes away - but when the dust settled it was a huge disappointment for the continent to spend the second half of the tournament watching from home.
B - Boot (Golden). With the final and third-place playoff to come, Englands Harry Kane is in pole position on six goals, ahead of Belgiums Romelu Lukaku, Portugals Cristiano Ronaldo and Russias Denis Cheryshev, all on four. Kanes tally matches Gary Lineker in 1986 as Englands tournament best and is the first to include three penalties. Brazils Ronaldo, who got eight in 2002, is the only player in the last 10 tournaments to score more than six.
C - Counter-attack. Belgium proved the masters of the counter-attack and there can have been few better, or more dramatic, examples than their brilliant 94th-minute winner against Japan. From a Japanese corner, via the hands of goalkeeper Thibaut Courtois, four Belgians somehow found the will to drive the length of the pitch to create a wonderful goal of pace and precision, finished off by Nacer Chadli.
D - Debutants. Iceland continued from where they left off at the 2016 Euros, drawing with Argentina, giving their all and coming up just short in a tough group. Panama were horribly outclassed - thrashed by Belgium and England and even beaten by Tunisia.
E - Europe. For the third tournament in four, there is an all-European final. This and the previous Europe-based tournament also featured all-European semi-final lineups. Once again the continents top sides, and some of its lesser ones, have left the rest of the world trailing - and that was with Italy and the Netherlands watching from home.
F - Forgotten. It could have been one of the greatest-ever World Cup goals and instead turned into one of the greatest-ever World Cup saves, but Jordan Pickfords unbelievable stop from Mateus Uribes 30-metre top-corner piledriver was not even repeated on the big screen in the Spartak Stadium as from the resulting corner Colombia snatched a mayhem-inducing equaliser.
G - Golden Generation. Belgiums players were sick and tired of hearing about and being asked about the tag and how it was time to deliver. In most ways they did, performing superbly, scoring memorable goals and dispatching Brazil in the quarter-finals, but they could not muster enough ideas to unpick the French defence in the last four. The bulk of the team, certainly its creative end, is still far from retirement age so stand by for more GG headlines in two years.
H - Hazard. Finally he wore the mantle of superstar like it was not a hair shirt. After disappearing as Belgium slipped out of the last World Cup and 2016 Euros, Eden Hazard really stepped up to the mark in Russia. Demanding the ball, dominating the key games, he could not quite get them over the line in the semi-final but nobody can this time accuse him of not trying.
I - Its (not) coming home. Englands unexpected run to the semi-finals launched a nationwide reprise of the 1996 anthem Footballs coming home, which also boomed out of the loudspeakers at every stadium before they played and after every goal. Back at Euro 96 they sang about 30 years of hurt in relation to the barren spell after the 1966 World Cup. Its now up to 52... and counting.
J - Japan. Flew the Asia flag with pride on and off the pitch. After their heart-breaking late defeat by Belgium Japans players might have been forgiven for throwing a few cups and punching the odd wall. Instead they picked up every piece of debris and left their dressing room looking as if it had never been used. All they left behind was a note, in Russian, thanking their hosts. Pure class.
K - Kante. Can any player ever have had so much influence on the success of his teams while attracting so little attention NGolo Kante patrols the area in front of his defence with such understanding and appreciation that he rarely seems to need to sprint, let alone stretch. He is a dream-screen for the men behind him and, as so many teams in Russia have discovered, an absolute nightmare to have to get past.
L - Late goals. Barely a day seemed to pass without some team snatching a goal in the dying moments - helped by what seemed to be the new minimum of five minutes stoppage time. Iran, Colombia, England, Portugal, Argentina, Brazil, Germany, Tunisia and others all enjoyed that explosion of joy and relief that comes with a last-gasp winner or equaliser and that have contributed to so much of this tournaments excitement.
M - Modric (not Messi). Luka Modric has matured through the tournament, and matured through the game in Croatias semi-final victory over England. His ease of movement, eye for the right pass and overall class eventually shone through as those around him fell away. Not so Lionel Messi, who left with his World Cup dream unfulfilled. One of the greatest players of all time alongside Pele and Diego Maradona went out with barely a whimper to join the sub-set of GOATs who have never won the World Cup - including Ferenc Puskas, Johan Cruyff and George Best, who never even got to play in one.
N - Neymar. Option 1. Bravely recovering from a long injury absence, Neymar, the most-fouled player in the tournament, had more attempts on goal than any other player and did all he could to drag a disappointing Brazil team towards a first final for 16 years. Option 2. Neymar personified everything bad about the worlds most popular game - his amazing talent overshadowed by diving, cheating, and truly ridiculous rolling around that made him the planets biggest laughing stock.
O - Oldest. Egypt goalkeeper Essam El-Hadary became the oldest player to appear in a World Cup finals game when he played in his countrys final group game against Saudi Arabia at the age of 45 years, 161 days.
P - Penalties. The 28 awarded up to and including the semi-finals was a tournament record by a distance with the previous highest being the 18 given in 2002. Several were the result of VAR intervention.
Q - Qatar. Host country for the next World Cup, to be held in November/December 2022, where determined fans will be sometimes able to watch three games in a day - instead of taking three days to get to a game in Russia.
R - Ronaldo. With his shorts hitched to the max, Ronaldos last-gasp, free-kick equaliser in the 3-3 draw with Spain was one of the highlights of the early matches. He continued to perform heroics but was unable to drag a very limited Portugal team into the quarter-finals. Of the Big Three in Russia, however, he can probably be most pleased with his contribution.
S - Sneaky. Colombias players appeared to have been overtaken by mass hysteria when a penalty was awarded against them for hauling down Englands Harry Kane but in the midst of the four-minute protest one of them was in the moment enough to repeatedly dig his heal into the grass around the penalty spot in a feeble attempt to make things difficult for the penalty-taker. It didnt work as Kane converted and England went on to win on a penalty shootout.
T - Tiki-Taka. Spain made an astonishing 1,137 passes in 120 minutes against Russia but barely created a scoring opportunity and went out on penalties. Pointless passing suddenly looked so last decade. Back to the tactical drawing board.
V - VAR. With very few exceptions the first use of the Video Assistant Referee system has been a huge success. Several penalties were awarded, and a handful overturned, on the basis of replays and fears of repeated and lengthy delays proved largely unfounded.
U - Upsets. In World Cup terms they dont come any bigger than Germany losing to South Korea to finish bottom of their group. Spain being knocked out by 70th-ranked Russia, Argentina held by Iceland and torn apart by Croatia and Spain and Portugal clinging on by their fingertips to draws against Morocco and Iran also had the neutrals cheering.
W - Wrestling. For some unknown reason, dozens of players decided that the best way to defend a corner was to ignore the ball and instead wrap their arms around their opponent and wrestle them to the ground. After initially turning a blind eye, FIFA and its referees decided to clamp down and started awarding penalties - much to the shocked outrage of those who had grappled with impunity in their opening games.
X - Xenophobia. Despite all the dire warnings, there has been none, and Russians have shown themselves to be friendly hosts in every city.
Y - Yellow. The famed and adored kit of Brazil, which they chose to sometimes replace with a new shiny blue one, as did Colombia. Nigeria introduced a kit that was a world-wide best-seller, then wore a change strip for their first game. Commercial imperative blew tradition out of the window and left fans scratching their heads.
Z - Zagallo. Mario Zagallo won the World Cup twice with Brazil in 1958 and 1962 then managed them to the title in 1970. Franz Beckenbauer followed him (1974 and 1990) and now Didier Deschamps, captain of Frances 1998 winners, has the chance to join a very exclusive club.  Agencies
