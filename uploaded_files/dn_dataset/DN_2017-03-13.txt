915 coins removed from stomach of piggy bank turtle
Veterinary surgeons in Thailand saved the life of a 25-year-old turtle whose name means piggy bank by removing 915 coins from her abdomen. Nantarika Chansue, a veterinary scientist at Chulalongkorn University and the country's leading expert on sea turtles, said Omsin the turtle spent years living in a pond in Sri Racha, where residents and visitors would throw coins to the amphibian as part of a good luck ritual.
Chansue said Omsin, whose name means piggy bank, was brought to her when the animal's health began to fail and a CT scan revealed the cause of Omsin's discomfort - a giant clump of coins in her abdomen.
"It's torture for animals after they eat the coins people throw into ponds," Chansue told Khaosod. "Instead of getting merit, you actually commit a sin."
More than a dozen surgeons and assistants worked for seven hours to remove the 915 coins, totaling 11 pounds of metal, from inside the turtle.
"We found coins both in her stomach and intestines," Chansue said. "If we didn't operate on her then she wouldn't have been able to eat or defecate, and would have soon died."
Chansue said in a Facebook post the turtle is on the mend and already breathing easier after losing nearly 10 percent of her body weight in the surgical procedure. She said the turtle will be observed for another couple of weeks while recovering from the surgery before being transferred to a conservation center. UPI

Airport strike strands visitors to ITB Berlin conference
Visitors attending one of the worlds biggest travel fair, ITB, were stranded in Berlin as striking ground workers forced almost all flights in and out of the German capital to be canceled.
About 670 arrivals and departures were scrapped at Berlins Tegel and Schoenefeld airports on Friday, after the Ver.di union called on more than 2,000 ground workers to walk out in a pay dispute. The one-day action comes just as the ITB Berlin fair, which draws 180,000 visitors annually, gears up for its busiest period.
Several Sri Lankans attending the events too had to forgo their flights and reschedule or take rail or long journey bus connections out of Berlin.
Workers are seeking higher pay following five rounds of unsuccessful negotiations, as European Union rules to bring more competition to ground handling have squeezed wages. Ver.di has already held warning strikes this year and more disruptions are possible in coming weeks. The dispute adds to Berlins aviation embarrassments, with the opening of its new airport delayed until 2018 following a series of technical fiascos and budget overruns.
The top carriers at Tegel airport are Air Berlin Plc, Deutsche Lufthansa AG and British Airways. The biggest ones serving Schoenefeld are Ryanair Holdings Plc, EasyJet Plc and Norwegian Air Shuttle ASA.
Lufthansa scrapped its entire flight program to and from Berlin on Friday, resulting in 68 cancellations. Air Berlin warned its customers on Thursday to expect massive travel disruptions, and said they can rebook their tickets, trade them in for rail vouchers within Germany, or request refunds. Valuables should be taken in carry-on luggage only, as baggage handling will also be affected, the airline said.
Workers are demanding a raise of 1 euro per hour under a one-year contract, representing an increase of more than 10 percent for the lowest wage group which earns 9.30 euros ($9.86) per hour. Employers, which include Wisag, Aviation Solution and Aeroground Berlin, offered an 8 percent raise over three years, Ver.di said.
The union is also negotiating pay for ground-handling employees in Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Cologne, Leipzig, Dresden and Stuttgart, where 300 workers held a warning strike earlier this month. The union reached an agreement in Hamburg in February that would give ground workers about 200 euros more per month over two years, though members have yet to accept the settlement.
Berlins airports served a combined 32.9 million passengers in 2016, a gain of 11 percent from a year earlier.

[APPRECIATIONS - (13-03-2017)]
Ranjith Mulleriyawa
Adroit altruist
It was a bright Monday morning in the latter part of 2013; a smart gentleman with a white beard on his face who dressed in a pair of denim trousers and a T-shirt was very enthusiastically searching for something along the corridors of the Department of Pharmacology.
I found the gentleman was leading to the weekly meeting room situated in the Centre for Education, Research and Training on Kidney Diseases (CERTKiD), at the very corner of Department of Pharmacology in the Faculty of Medicine, Peradeniya. He was very pleasant, well-read personality who was expressing his interest very clearly to find a solution for dry zone's killer disease Chronic Kidney disease of uncertain etiology (CKDu).
Ranjith Mulleriyawa, a graduate of University of the Philippines, with a diploma in agriculture from School of Agriculture, Kundasale, turned out to be the first graduate farmer in Mahiyanganaya who farmed on his own plot of land by the side of the Mahaweli river basin for more than a decade.
We were blessed to accompany such a jolly, good fellow on our field trips; he kept us awake throughout the journey by unfolding his wonderful memories. He could read the dry zone farmer better than any other scientist. He wanted to salvage the dry zone farmer as soon as possible from CKDu, and used his pen to get the attention of responsible authorities towards the battered dry zone farmer.
Ranjith Mulleriyawa was so brave enough to express his views that he once said, Too much talk and too little work on combatting CKDu would not bring much results." He had set an example to the younger generation at his late seventies by helping the dry zone farmer at their door step, instead of talking about CKDu in the five-star facility. With the available scientific evidence, he was convinced that providing good quality water to all farmers would take the CKDu away from the dry zone. He had written many articles on this issue.
He believed that rainwater harvesting was the cheapest and most sustainable source of drinking water for the dry zone's scattered dwellings. A pilot project was launched at Ginnoruwa Grama Niladhari division at Giradurukotte to provide safe water through rainwater harvesting. Initial expenditure was borne by friends and relatives to start off the rainwater harvesting pilot project in early 2016. The project was supported by Commercial Banks CSR project. CERTKiD and International Water Management Institute helped the investigations.
Mulleriyawa initiated the work with two highly committed women in the village. He spent many days with the villagers, and mapped out the village. He discovered the concept of CKDu hot spot, where the CKDu prevalence was very high. Further, he had found that there were high and low prevalent CKDu affected regions situated side-by-side in similar climatic conditions. The rationale to disprove the agro-chemical hypothesis for the etiology of CKDu was pointed out by him.
I would like to quote a little from his work. The percentages of households affected with CKDu were Sarabhoomi, 2%; Serupitiya, 3%; Ginnoruwa, 7%; Badulupura 25%. In Sarabhoomi, there was only one positively diagnosed CKDU patient, he too had lived for 10 years in Badulupura.
Farmers in both Badulupura and Sarabhoomi had their paddy fields located in the same tract of flat land. They used the same fertilizer and pesticides. Therefore, agro-chemicals applied to the paddy fields could not be the cause of CKDu. The likely cause could've been some other environmental factor in the homesteads of Badulupura.
He did not stop mapping the villages; he wanted to explore the hydro-geological conditions of the villages. He was untiring to consult the geologist Prof. Chandrajith and getting down the water samples for analysis at Peradeniya. Further, he sat with Dr. Tilak Abeysekera, learnt medicine gradually, and published a few basic health advice articles. He helped the villagers by organizing screening programs and referring the suspected cases to the health authorities.
It was a great shock to hear that Ranjith Mulleriyawa, a graduate farmer, a researcher, a media and a social service personnel, left us forever on September 10, 2016. CERTKiD lost a valuable member, the family lost a caring husband and loving father.
He was an honourable servant of Sri Lanka; a great man who left valuable footprints to follow.
Dr. Zeid Badurdeen
Dr. M. H. A. Rasheed
Jewel of a person
I came to know Dr. Rasheed when I joined the King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals (KFUPM) in Dhahran, Saudi Arabia, in 1994.
He was one of the finest people I had ever met. I cannot forget the concern and interest he showed when my wife fell ill in Dhahran. Dr. Rasheed was very concerned, and got the KFUPM medical center to conduct numerous medical tests that contributed to my wife's recovery.
During his recent illness, his wife, Nilufer; son, Dr. Rifeth, and daughter, Sifara, took great pains to bring him back to active life. Unfortunately, this was not to be, and he departed for eternal rest.
Dr. Rasheed had his early education at Royal College and Thurstan College, Colombo. Subsequently, he entered the Khyber Medical College, Peshawar, Pakistan, to study medicine. After qualifying as a medical doctor, he proceeded to USA to do his post-graduate studies. After his post graduate studies, he became a fellow of the American Academy of Paediatrics in Toledo, Ohio.
Since then, he has been working as a Pediatrician in a number of countries including his mother country, Sri Lanka. He was the Chief Paediatrician attached to the medical center of KFUPM for 23 years. The services he rendered to the children of the KFUPM community during this period are invaluable. He was always available whenever a child needed the attention of a doctor, irrespective of whether it was daytime or middle of the night. After his return to Sri Lanka, a few years ago, he worked at the Sulaiman's Hospital, Colombo, as a Paediatrician.
His recent departure is a great loss to his patients, relatives, and friends.
May his soul rest in Peace!

ATII lecturers boycott question paper evaluation
Lecturers of Sri Lanka Institute of Advanced Technological Education - ATII Academics Union throughout the island have decided to boycott evaluation of question papers from March 8.
The decision was taken by the Trade Union of the academic staff to urge the authorities to rectify the anomaly in the salaries and other allowances lagging for years.
ATII Academics Union President Ishar Ali said previous and the present governments failed to resolve the anomaly in the salaries and other allowances of the staff members. Responsibility for all the consequences arising from this trade union action should be borne by the subsequent governments that have failed to straighten up these anomalies.
We request the present government to solve this problem as soon as possible so that the students will not beleaguered. All 270 staff members have refrained from marking papers and if this marking process delayed the students wont be able to apply for courses on time. The trade union action will create an impact on issuing result of students, enrolment of new students and recruitment for the existing vacancies, he said.
ATII Academics Union Secretary D. M. T. Chandika said, The trade union action is carried out in 18 advanced technological institutes in Colombo, Dehiwala, Galle, Gampaha, Kandy, Jaffna and Ampara. Total number of answer scripts to be evaluated exceeds 125,000. About 21,000 students are studying in these institutes.
We have held many discussions with the Higher Education Minister. Although they promise to solve this problem, it remains in its initial stage. Although, State Minister Mohan Lal Grero agreed in August 2016 to pay a Rs. 10,000 allowance per month using the funds earned by the advanced technological institute until the problem is resolved, that too has not materialized, he said.
There have been letter circulating among Department of Management Services, Education Ministry, National Salaries Commission, University Grants Commission for the last three years without any result. Our Trade Union has no faith in the National Salaries Commission as they have not responded to this problem for many years.
"We have taken this trade union action so as to make an impact on the government and we expect to continue trade union action, he said.
Nearly 21,000 students were studying in these institutes in 2016. This is the only institute for the A/L students who do not get an opportunity to enter the universities and these students are enrolled based on the A/C results. Last 86 students with 3 As have registered at the Dehiwala institute, he said.

Barefoot marks Womens Day with Sari Connection from Jaffna, Mullaitivu
An event was held at the Barefoot Gallery Colombo on Saturday March 4,to mark International Womens Day and showcase the Sari Connection project and its unique products with seamstresses from Jaffna and Mullaitivu.
The Sari Connection is a novel project that has made waves in the community and is implemented by a Japanese Non-profit organization known as PARC Inter-peoples Cooperation (PARCIC)) which is supported by Japan International Cooperation Agency JICA.
The project produces unique handcrafted goods from up-cycled saris which are much in demand. Their products range from blouses and pants to bags, accessories, cushion covers etc which are very popular items in the communities. The products are created by women living in Jaffna and Mullaitivu  two conflict affected and tsunami-hit areas in the north of the country - whose lives have been transformed by their engagement in the project.
Through this project, used saris are collected as donations island-wide and those saris are refashioned into beautiful clothes and accessories by women groups in the North. The revenue generated through sales of these products helps to improve the livelihood of those women. The products are gaining attention especially in the tourist market, and expanding its sales channels to major souvenir shops, such as Laksala, Lakpahana and Barefoot Galle.
Three seamstresses from the project spoke about their experiences and demonstrated how they make bags from used saris.
Selvaranchini from Jaffna said the project was a great boon for her to support her family and her old parents by herself as a single woman who has lost most of her close relatives.
The project gives hope for women like her, and an opportunity to express themselves through these sewing activities. Pushpalatha from Mullaitivu said that learning various stitching techniques has given her a lot of confidence as a seamstress.
A team from Singer (Sri Lanka) , represented by Koshitha Peramunugamage, head of Singer Business School, donated two boxes of used saris to the project, and provided two sewing machines for demonstration on the day. Sari Connection is collecting all kinds of used saris. Contact [emailprotected] for sari donations.

Battle of the Golds : Mishen excels for Sebs
Prince of Wales College drew with St. Sebastian's College in their annual 67th Big Match the Battle of the Golds worked off at De Soysa Stadium Moratuwa and with this result now the series tally stands at Cambrians five wins Sebs three and 58 drawn.
Anyhow Cambrians were able to get a slender first innings lead of nine runs in this encounter. In reply to the Cambrian total of 230 runs on day one Sebs scored 221 runs with their skipper and Sri Lanka Under 19 Cap Mishen Silva scoring a breezy knock of 77 runs, which consisted of eight hits to the ropes and four over and he was associated in a valuable partnership of 87 runs for the sixth wicket with Tharusha Fernando who scored 40 runs.
Earlier v ice captain Nimesh Bandara had a patient knock of 43 runs and Kaumal Nanayakkara was the pick of the bowlers for Cambrians with a good spell of 5 for 46 while Tharuka Fernando too claimed 3 for 50 who was responsible for the early breakthrough. Cambrian captain Vishva Chaturanga the Sri Lanka Under 19 teams glove man set a record for Cambrians with six victims behind the stumps in a single innings and perhaps it may be a record for both schools in this big match series.
When rain intervened the game came to a halt and Cambrians were 41 for 1 with Vishva Chaturanga unbeaten on 26 runs.

Britains most expensive flower pot
A marble trough used for growing tulips for 100 years has been identified as a Roman sarcophagus worth more than 300,000.
It was discovered at Blenheim Palace has been found after having tulips grown in it for on the grounds of Blenheim Palace where it had been used for the last 100 years as a flower pot.
An ancient Roman sarcophagus worth up to 300,000 has been discovered on the grounds of Blenheim Palace where it had been used for the last 100 years as a flower pot.
The historic marble coffin has been exposed to the elements for the last century and used as an oversized planter to grow tulips in in the rock garden of Sir Winston Churchill s birthplace in Oxfordshire.
And for 100 years before that the 1,800 year old sarcophagus was used as a makeshift water feature by the 5th Duke of Marlborough who obtained it in the 19th century.
Palace officials were prompted to take a closer look at the 6ft 6ins long object after an antiques expert spotted its ornate carvings while making an unrelated visit.
The palace had conservators remove the front marble section, which is the original part, and carry out an extensive investigation.
They identified the basin as a white marble sarcophagus depicting Dionysian revelry dating back to 300AD.
Its splendid bas-relief carvings depict a drunken Dionysus, the god of wine, leaning on an equally inebriated woodland god known as satyr.
The pair are flanked by party revelers including Hercules and Ariadne as well as two large lion heads. The marble section weighs nearly 900lbs.
The sarcophagus has been placed on public display in an underground room in Blenheim Palace.
In 2013 auctioneer Guy Schwinge sold a similar sarcophagus for 100,000 after finding it being used as a plant trough, said this example could be worth three times that.
Mr Schwinge, of Dukes Auctioneers of Dorchester, Dorset, said: The quality of this sarcophagus panel suggests it was made in Rome for a high status member of the patrician elite.
The overall form and Dionysian carving suggest a date late in the late 2nd century and the lions masks are a clear expression of Roman Imperial power. A comparable panel from the collection of John Pierpont Morgan, datable to around 180 AD, came up for auction in New York a few years ago. At auction a panel of this sophistication could easily realise 300,000 or more with the Blenheim Palace provenance.
Kate Ballenger, house manager at the palace, said: We were alerted to the sarcophagus importance by an antiques expert who was visiting the estate. We always thought it was a beautiful sculpture but we were not aware of the fact is was a Roman sarcophagus dating back to 300AD. First an elaborate water feature and then a planter for flowers, it has now been conserved and relocated inside the palace. We are delighted to have it back and the restoration work is very impressive. Now it is in a consistent indoor climate away from the natural elements we are hoping it will remain in good condition and survive for many more centuries to come.
Nicholas Banfield, of Cliveden Conservation of Taplow, Berks who has overseen the restoration, said: The piece is actually in remarkable condition considering it has withstood seemingly aggressive environments, particularly that of a fountain receptacle.
Following an initial in-situ inspection we were able to unbolt it from the lead cistern to which it was attached and take it back to our workshops for full cleaning, repair and stabilisation.
The marble coffin was originally obtained by the 5th Duke of Marlborough, who was famous for his extravagant collection of antiquities, around 200 years ago.
The noblemans illustrious name did not, however, save him from his mounting debts and his estates were seized and his collections sold.
This particular piece was one of a few he maintained ownership of after retiring to Blenheim Palace. Mirror

Can sweat patches revolutionise diabetes
Scientists have developed a sensor that can monitor blood sugar levels by analysing sweaty skin.
But rather than a gym-soaked t-shirt, it needs just one millionth of a litre of sweat to do the testing.
The team - in South Korea - showed the sensor was accurate and think it could eventually help patients with diabetes.
And in extra tests on mice, the sensor was hooked up to a patch of tiny needles to automatically inject diabetes medication.
The team at the Seoul National University were trying to overcome the need for "painful blood collection" needed in diabetes patients. Type 1 diabetes is caused by the immune system attacking the part of the body that controls blood sugar levelsType 2 diabetes is often caused by lifestyle damaging the body's ability to control blood sugar levelsPatients with both conditions need to medically control their blood sugar levels to prevent damage to the body and even death
This is how patients with diabetes would normally keep track of blood sugar levels:
And this could be the future.
The sensor is flexible so it can move with the skin it is stuck onto.
However, the scientists needed to overcome a series of challenges to make it work.
There is less sugar in sweat than blood so it is harder to find, and other chemicals in sweat such as lactic acid can disrupt the results.
So the patch has three sensors keeping track of sugar levels, four that test the acidity of the sweat and a humidity sensor to analyse the amount of sweat. It is all encased in a porous layer that allows the sweat to soak through and bathe the electronics. All this information is passed onto a portable computer which does the analysis to work out the sugar levels. Tests before and after people sat down for a meal, published in the journal Science Advances, showed the results from the sweat patch "agree well" with those from traditional kit.
However, for the next stage the researchers turned to mice with diabetes.
They used the blood sugar monitor to control an array of microneedles to give the mice doses of the diabetes drug metformin.
The researchers conclude: "The current system provides important new advances toward the painless and stress-free" care for diabetes. However, there is a leap between proving something can sense sugar levels in a lab and turning that into something that is so reliable people can put their lives in its hands.
So the researchers next want to test how the patches work in the long-term.

Castaway feminine gender makes astounding headway
Wednesday was International Womens Day (IWD). It is a global event to celebrate women, unity, reflection, advocacy and action.
The 2017 theme for IWD focuses on Women in the Changing World of Work: Planet 50-50 by 2030. The world of work is changing, with significant implications for women. On one hand, technological advances and globalization bring unprecedented opportunities for those who can access them. On the other hand, there is growing informality of labour, income inequality and humanitarian crises.
A series of events
The day is usually marked with a series of events including political rallies, business conferences, networking events, craft markets, fashion parades, theatrical performances and more. Even Google usually does its bit by doing a Google Doodle.
In 1975, March 8 was announced as the official date for IWS by the United Nations. IWD was first started as a political and socialist movement in 1909 in four European countries. It soon spread with a determined screech and began reaching out to be celebrated in other parts of the globe in different ways. It is a day to commemorate the achievements of women and to raise awareness for the social and political equality of women around the world. It aims to highlight the importance of creating conditions for the elimination of discrimination against women and for their full and equal participation in social development. The day is also a time to reflect on progress made, to call for further change and to celebrate acts of courage and determination by ordinary women who have played an extraordinary role in the history of their countries and communities. As UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres aptly put it: For too long, discriminatory stereotypes have prevented women and girls from having equal access to education in science, technology, engineering and math (STEM). As a trained engineer and former teacher, I know that these stereotypes are flat wrong. They deny women and girls the chance to realise their potential and deprive the world of the ingenuity and innovation of half the population. On this International Day, I urge commitment to end bias, greater investments in STEM education for all women and girls as well as opportunities for their careers and longer-term professional advancement so that all can benefit from their ground-breaking future contributions.
The remarkable aspect
Surely, it is right and just that the world recognises the achievements of women regardless of national, ethnic, linguistic, cultural, economic or political divisions. Its objectives must include promoting gender relations, gender equality, celebrating and encouraging positive female role models which in turn will inspire the younger feminist generation.
South Asia comprises eight nations  Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Sri Lanka  and is bursting with various aspects of culture. However it is worth noting that almost half of the female population, experiences rampant gender based violence and discrimination in the areas of education, nutrition, health and employment, curtailing their human rights, disrupting gender equality and their general well being.
Yet, all over the world the turnaround in some cases of womens success stories is causing turned heads, raised eyebrows, and some rifts in what is still seen as a male dominated society. But, thanks to the precedents set by courageous and resourceful women front-runners who have wielded remarkable influence, others of their gender have and are being encouraged to step up and take leadership roles as businesswomen, heads of financial firms, teachers, scholars and writers.
The remarkable aspect to all this is that the relatively new-found inspiration seems contagious. It is not at all surprising that the trend has caught on in many parts of Asia. And who can forget Sri Lanka, the little nation that gave the world its first woman prime minister. Look around you and there is no gainsaying the fact that local women are starting businesses at a record pace, rising to key leadership positions, and helping communities flourish across the nation.
Today, they continue to inspire women in every strata of society to reach their fullest potential. In essence, they have challenged the way men and women think about business, education, politics and life in general. In Sri Lanka both through traditional roles as mothers and wives andas professionals, businesswomen, financial leaders, media personnel and teachers, women have made great strides to hold their own in a male-dominated world.
Essentially important
There was a time, not too long ago, when it would have seemed unimaginable for a woman to have broken through the highest, hardest glass ceiling. The connotation refers to occupying the corner office or the executive suite. At present, thanks to the achievements of several trail-blazing icons to inspire them many women have blended into the professional and personal sphere with less conflict than they ever encountered before. Things certainly seem to be looking up for women in corporate Sri Lanka. Yes, and times certainly appear to be changing in our conservative little world of business enterprise. One of the more significant among them is the empowerment of women in all spheres of trade, finance and industry.
In corporate Sri Lanka a good many women professionals have shattered the gender stereotype and climbed to the highest rung of the hierarchal or rather matriarchal ladder. Indeed, a handful of remarkable personalities have created history by heading some of the countrys most elite institutions.
In the present day world relationships have become very important as the level of insecurity is just augmenting every day. The woman, in your life, plays a very important supportive and encouraging role. She is the sole inspiration factor for you. So, it is essentially important to have the best wife, girlfriend gift ideas to help you reiterate the fact that you love her the most. They are important as far as maintaining a relationship is concerned.
In truth, it has been their fortitude, vision and pluck that have carried them to the very zenith of their careers. They have done so with admirable determination displaying those rare attributes of courage, resilience and endurance. And all the more credit to them because they have achieved their ambitions despite the entrenched gender bias that pervades our culture.
Many global corporations have also started to more actively support IWD by running their own internal events through supporting external ones. Year on year IWD is certainly increasing in status. The United States even designates the whole month of March as 'Women's History Month'.
So lets all make a difference, think globally and act locally! Make everyday International Women's Day. Do your bit to ensure that the future for the fair sex is bright, equal, safe and rewarding.

Ceylinco Life wins Peoples Life Insurance Brand award at SLIM-Nielsen
Ceylinco Life was adjudged the Peoples Life Insurance Brand of the Year at the 2017 SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards, reaffirming Ceylinco Insurances status as the most popular insurer in the country for the 11th consecutive year.
The hallmark awards event of the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM), the 2017 awards at Waters Edge saw the countrys top brands across multiple sectors being honoured, following a nationwide assessment of public opinion.
Ceylinco Insurance enjoys the rare distinction of being adjudged the Peoples Insurance Brand of the Year every year since the awards programme was launched 11 years ago.
For the first time this year,the award was presented separately to Life and General Insurance companies, following the segregation of insurance business by law in 2015.
Ceylinco Lifes award was accepted on behalf of the company by Rajkumar Renganathan, Managing Director and CEO and Thushara Ranasinghe, Director and Deputy CEO.
Everything we do is for our policyholders, and with the lives of about 5 per cent of our countrys population insured with us, we are truly the life insurance company of the people, Renganathan commented. The Peoples Awards are important because they formally affirm the peoples choice, which is a critical consideration for any business.
The SLIM-Nielsen Peoples Awards recognise brands and personalities that have made a profound impression in the minds of the people of Sri Lanka and are one of the most awaited marketing events in the corporate calendar as the nominees and awardees are chosen by the voice of the people, through a comprehensive nationwide research conducted by Nielsen Sri Lanka.
The selection of the winners in the different sectors and categories is based on a nationwide quantitative face-to-face survey covering 3,000 males and females between the ages of 15 to 60, using a structured questionnaire. Respondents are asked to mention their favourite brands and personalities across various categories, and those that receive the highest nominations are declared the winners.
Ceylinco Life ended 2016 with total income of Rs 23.4 billion, premium income of Rs 15 billion, a Life Fund of Rs 78 billion and an investment portfolio with a value in excess of Rs 80 billion, making it the market leader in the countrys life insurance industry for the 13th successive year.

Champika wants District Quota System changed
The District Quota System must be changed and more chances should be given on individual merit when enrolling students to State universities, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister pointed out that Medical, Engineering and Dental Faculties of State universities must be opened for students who are denied university entrance due to the District Quota System, to have education after paying the course fee.
He said this proposal, if enacted, would enable those Faculties themselves to find the capital expenditure needed.
The minister made these observations participating in the adjournment debate on the SAITM issue in Parliament on Thursday.
He also pointed out that there is no need for the government to make a commitment to absorb all the medical degree holders into the government service.
There is no rule that says that all the engineers coming out of universities be given State sector appointments. Why do we have such a policy when it comes to doctors Let them go for open competition, he stated.
The minister, who was vocal against the SAITM, said this institute has proven its incapability to win social respect. The shooting incident involving the SAITM CEO that has been staged showed that its administrators are more like underworld leaders, he said.
He said education should not be a profit-oriented business, adding that this is a key problem with regard to SAITM. The cost of producing a medical graduate in a State university is about Rs 2.5 million, where the SAITM charges Rs 12 million. The balance f Rs 9.5 million is the profit obtained from each graduate, he pointed out.
Some argue that thousands of students who are qualified to university entrance are deprived of that opportunity. However, keep in mind that three S passes are the minimum qualification to university entrance and that means obtaining 35 marks for each paper. This could be sufficient in 1979, but this is not valid today. I propose to increase the benchmark for university entrance as 50 marks for each paper, he commented.
The minister pointed out that the records of Colombo Medical Faculty and Engineering Faculties of Moratuwa and Peradeniya showed that a significant number of students who enter from the district quota do not complete the degree. I recommend that we give more weight to individual merit, he added.

Charting a path towards Lankas durable success
It is not just because I am from Venezuela that I see Sri Lanka with admiration and envy. The island has made more progress in human development than any other in South Asia. It has reduced poverty in a pretty dramatic way. It has many reasons to be proud of its achievements. But anything that is worth doing, is worth doing better. The Center for International Development at Harvard University is collaborating with the Government of Sri Lanka to work on a strategy to make progress faster, more sustainable and more inclusive.
In the process of coming up with ideas on a better path forward, we carried out, with government officials and the Millennium Challenge Corporation, a growth diagnostic. The gist behind this methodology is to identify the binding constraints that are holding progress back.
Typically, most countries can improve on many areas, but there are bottlenecks in some areas that hold back progress in a general and systemic way, while others are either nice to have or even potentially bad to have at present, because it would worsen other more pressing constraints.
In going through the list of possible constraints and their tale-telling symptoms of their bindingness, two things caught my attention: the fiscal situation and the weakness of the export sector. Taxes as a share of GDP had been falling like a stone  from about 18% of GDP in 1995 to about 10% 20 years later.
The public debt to GDP ratio and the interest rate on that debt is uncomfortably high and access to additional financing is precarious. That is why I felt it was really opportune for the government to quickly negotiate a support programme with the International Monetary Fund.
This programme is correctly focused on raising the ability of the state to raise tax revenue, so that it can have the resources with which to accompany the growth of the economy and prevent fiscal weakness from threatening macro stability. Significant progress was made in 2016.
New products
The second problem is the weakness of the export sector. Sri Lankas overall economy has grown much faster than the export sector. As a consequence, the ratio of export of goods and services to GDP has declined from 39% to 21 % between 2000 and 2014, the only country in the region where this ratio has declined. At the core of this weak performance is the lack of innovation on the export basket.
This basket is still dominated by tea, rubber and garments, when other countries in the region moved into electronics, machinery and chemicals. To put some numbers into this picture, China, Thailand and Vietnam introduced, respectively, 76, 70 and 48 product lines since 2000. These product lines generated 245, 326 and 545 additional dollars per capita in export revenue. By contrast, Sri Lanka only introduced 7 product lines that represented only 5 dollars per capita in additional revenue.
Moving into new products is always difficult because you cannot make things you do not know how to do and you typically do not know how to do the things you do not make.
This chicken and egg problem is often resolved through contact with people and organisations who already know how to do those things, just not in your country. These sources are immigrants, diasporas and foreign direct investment. On these fronts, we can compare and contrast Sri Lanka to other countries.
We all know that back in 1965, Lee Kwan Yew spoke admiringly of Sri Lanka. Since then, the bulk of the flow of admiration has changed directions. Singapore is now some 7 times richer than Sri Lanka in per capita terms. Part of the secret of Singapore comes from the fact that about 40% of its population is foreign born: two out of every five. In Sri Lanka, the equivalent number is just 1.6% and of these, 99% are people born in India. This means that non-Indian foreigners are less than 1 in 6,000.
China benefited enormously from diasporas in Taiwan, Hong Kong and elsewhere that could bring to the mainland business ideas that had succeeded elsewhere. Indias Bangalore and Hyderabad have deep connections to the Indian diaspora in Silicon Valley and elsewhere. Sri Lanka, for reasons that we all understand, has had a more troubled relationship with much of its diaspora.
Finally, in the 1995-2015 period, foreign direct investment in Sri Lanka, at 1.1% of GDP has been just a small fraction of that observed in Malaysia (3.3%), Viet Nam (4.9%) and Singapore (21.9%). Moreover, the industries that predominantly attract this foreign investment in Sri Lanka  logistics, financial services and tourism  are growing their exports faster than other areas such as manufacturing.
Traditional exporters
In addition, much of the traditional export industry competes with poorer countries that pay lower wages. These industries pay some of the lowest wages in Sri Lanka. Moreover, as the economy grows and real wages increase, traditional exporters have trouble retaining the labour force they have. As a consequence, they shrink. By contrast as the economy grows, imports go up. The imbalance between booming imports and shrinking exports causes a widening balance of payments deficit that puts a brake on growth. This has lead to repeated balance of payments problems over the past 20 years, as in 2001, 2008 and after 2011.
The solution is to help the economy upgrade its current exports and find new ones. This is a process for which there is no known universal to-do list. It is about exploring the set of opportunities and identifying the obstacles that prevent them from happening. It requires engaging with the people at home and abroad that could engage in these activities and with the myriad of public sector entities that need to coordinate to help remove the identified obstacles.
With this in mind, my colleagues at the Center for International Development, led by Professor Matt Andrews, have worked with 5 inter-agency teams that bring experts together from the Board of Investment, Export Development Board, Tourism Development Authority, and Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade (with connections to the Prime Ministers Office, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Department of Commerce, among others).
These teams are leading the process of promoting emerging exports, targeting new non-existent industries, identifying and engaging with potential new investors, fixing the investment climate for these new emerging industries and figuring out how to make new tourist destinations, such as Kuchchaveli, succeed. In addition, Prof. Robert Lawrence is coordinating with a team that is working with Sri Lankan authorities on the trade negotiation strategies with India, China and Singapore in order to open new markets for old and new exports alike.
Sri Lankan civil service
In this work, we have been very positively surprised by the quality, energy and commitment of the Sri Lankan civil service. I think the teams are producing great work.
As we move forward, the implementation challenge is going to be related to streamlining the decision-making and execution capacity in a government with 51 ministries, 47 Cabinet ministers, 20 state ministers and 25 deputy ministers. The country needs to have an authorization and monitoring process that ensures cooperation, at the technical and political level, across ministries.
The activities I have discussed are but a fraction of the issues that the country must deal with. But success in these areas will accelerate progress, help create more jobs, raise worker incomes and increase tax revenues so that the country can have the resources with which to tackle other challenges. I hope I am right. In any case, I am rooting for Sri Lankas success.

## Title: Children, Compassion, Connection
## Supertitle:

Children, Compassion, Connection
Rabindranath Tagore once translated into words, a thought that all of us carry deep within us. Every child comes with the message that God is not yet discouraged of man.
It is true, is it not, that, like a tiny rose bud waiting for the warmth of the sun to open her petals, gently, softly, one tiny petal at a time, children come to us with hearts full of love, minds abundant with innocence, hands outstretched with trust. Left on their own, they will transcend borders, connect with each other as easily as a butterfly connects with a flower.
Unlike adults, children have more ways to connect, more potential to connect, more possibilities to connect. It is through our children that we can best bring down the borders we adults, blinded by greed, and thirst for power, misled by pseudo religious beliefs, have created among us.
When we look around us we see that we are surrounded by prejudice, violence and environmental endangerment. We know that these symptoms of a malicious disease which will one day destroy us altogether are not confined to a single nation or group of people. These are global maladies that affect all of us  whether we live in a mud hut in a small village in Unawatuna in Southern Sri Lanka or in a cottage in Namche bazaar, nestling against the Everest Mountains in Nepal. Yet, if we look more carefully we would see that love and compassion too are all around us, in places both obvious and subtle. It was obvious at the South Asian Literature conference held from 26th to 28th February, in Delhi this year, where writers and poets, hailing from seven different countries, brought up in seven different cultures, worshiping different deities, speaking different languages came together as one, united family. But where do we see love and compassion in subtle ways How do we discreetly encourage young people to envision and emotionally connect to events and experiences that may be the same or quite different to what they are familiar with, helping them to unite with their foreign brethren
Through children's literature. Through stories that offer portraits of characters and communities who seek, discover and convey, in different contexts, love and compassion. By tapping into the untrammeled minds of children through stories that encourage them to see all living beings as one, rather than as the other, we can create a future in which the word 'border' will have only one meaning: that of an ornamental strip or design around the edge of a printed page.
It was towards the end of colonial rule that literature written and published specifically for children in our country first began, when writers like Cumaratunga Munidasa, Martin Wickramasinghe and G.B Senanayake wrote the first books for children in Sinhala. Pre-colonial literature for children was oral in nature, passed down by adults in the form of folk tales, myths, songs, riddles and proverbs. During a good half of the colonial period, childrens reading was confined to textbooks and western literature which promoted western culture and values. However, political independence gained in 1948, led to the development of an intellectual climate that paved the way for childrens literature written and published indigenously. These books were predominantly written in Sinhala. Children's literature, written in English by Sri Lankan writers emerged only in the 1980s.
Chinua Achebe said it best when he wrote about the Nigerian child:
Before 1960 Nigerian children read nothing but British childrens books and had to be left to figure out what was meant by Big Ben, Westminster Abbey, Trafalgar Square and the Thames  subjects and images which convey no meaning and no feeling to the average Nigerian child in his natural environment.
Although Achebe refers here to Nigerian children, this statement can be applied to many children in various countries under British rule.
Today, however, children can identify themselves with the characters in their books, for, even though the language is English the stories are set in familiar backgrounds with familiar images. This also means these books provide 'windows' to children of neighbouring countries, giving them a glimpse of another country, her people, her culture.
Let me take as examples, two books written by Sri Lankan writers, Sybil Wettasinghe and Prof. J.B Disanayaka. They have broken the cultural imperialism of the west through their work and highlighted everything that is not a part of the Eurocentric white society, ironically,using the white man's language and fortunately too, for in spite of all the negative effects of colonial rule we did inherit a common language with which we can connect with others of our region and beyond, thanks to our colonizers.
In Sybil Wettasinghe's 'A Jump Over the Moon', on a moonlit night, Puncha tells his grandfather and grandmother, Mutta and Attamma, he can jump over the moon. Not believing he can do it Mutta and Attamma promises Puncha a bicycle if he jumps over the moon, but without hurting himself. Puncha brings a basin full of water into the garden, and watches it till the moon is reflected in the water. He jumps over the moon's reflection and wins the bet.
In J.B Disanayaka's 'Who's Afraid of Devils', Gamarala finds a devil living in the tall tree in the middle of his land. The devil claims the land is his and argues with the Gamarala. In the end they agree that Gamarala will share with the devil, the upper, or the lower end of whatever crop he harvests. But each season the devil fails to get the crop as the Gamarala cleverly makes variations in the crops he plants; one year he plants yams so that the devil who gets the upper part is left with the yam leaves, the next year he plants grains and the devil is left with the roots of the vines and so on and so forth. Finally, defeated, the devil agrees to leave the tree and settles down in another place.
These two texts written by two of the most prolific Sri Lankan writers of children's literature in English, differ from one another in many ways. Wettasinghe's 'A Jump over the Moon' is a realistic portrayal of fairly ordinary human life. Disanayaka's 'Who is Afraid of Devils' is a folk tale of the Sinhalese, retold in English.
It might seem surprising that texts so diverse could so easily scale the boundaries that divide us and show young readers the differences between the children of another country and themselves, but at the same time help them to perceive that there are important things that all human beings have in common.
One striking familiarity in both texts that help achieve this goal, is the language. The diction is simple. The style is straightforward. There is minimal description of the characters or places. Instead, the story moves forward with a consistent focus on actions  on what people say or do rather than on why they do it or what they are thinking of, as they do it thereby making it easier for readers of other cultures to understand the story.
To sum up, 'A Jump over the Moon' is a realistic story from which a reader from another culture can learn about ordinary lives of Sri Lankans. And, 'Who is Afraid of Devils' is a Sinhala folk tale that promotes cultural understanding in young readers from other countries. The underlying theme in each of these children's books written in English reflect the words of the eminent Sri Lankan poet Mahagama Sekera as written in his book titled Bodima.
DarmeCassimRajasundaramcome ye all,let's uniteand make this worldinto a better placefar better thanthe one we already know
Through books such as the ones discussed here we can develop empathy, awareness and sensitivity towards other cultures in our children, change perspectives and guide them to put themselves into the shoes of a person from a different culture.
If we promote children's literature written in English by the native writers of our countries there is no doubt that reaching beyond borders, heralding peace and harmony throuhout the world will no longer be a fairy tale.
Tips to help your child enjoy reading more:
1. Let your kids see you reading Children will mirror what they see their parents doing. Set a good example and read!
2. Surround your child with reading material Are there books around Having books around your home will make reading much easier. If it is available, it is much easier to start.
3. Make reading a fun tradition Set a time to read each day. Make it fun. Play the parts of the characters and use silly voices. Make reading enjoyable for everyone!
4. Encourage your child Read words aloud to your child and have them repeat difficult words. Point to pictures and read together. Sound out difficult words and show them. Laugh together and have a good time!
5. Rewards for reading What gets rewarded gets repeated. Reward your child for doing a great job. Encourage them to want to read more!

Common day to remember all war dead: Douglas
UPFA MP Douglas Devananda has proposed declaring a common day to commemorate the people who lost their lives due to the war and also to build a memorial to honour them. The MP has presented a private members motion in Parliament in this regard. He has proposed to declare an appropriate day to commemorate the people of all religions and nationalities that speak all languages who lost their lives due to the war and take measures to celebrate that day annually. The motion has further proposed to build a memorial in Omanthei in the Northern Province to honour their dedication, in the name of the motherland.
The memorial is intended to commemorate people of all religions, social levels and all nationalities that speak all languages who were killed due to the war and due to the anomalous conditions that prevailed during the recent past. The motion has been included in the Order Book through an Addendum published last Friday.

Counter Terrorism draft almost ready
The revised draft of the Counter Terrorism Act which has been sent to the Legal Draftsman is currently in the process of being converted into a Bill, a government source said.
A top level government official, speaking to the Daily News, said the legal framework and the framework of the proposed Counter Terrorism Act (CTA) underwent certain revisions based on four experts reports, provided by the consultancy appointed, on a request from the Sri Lankan government, by the United Nations to express its view on the said Bill. Then the revised version went before the Cabinet once again early this year and the Cabinet once again approved it. The revised text was sent to the Legal Draftsman in mid January to convert it into a draft Bill.
On the other hand, it was sent to the Parliamentary Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security and they were also invited to look into the revised version also. This is basically where we are now, the government source said.
Once the Legal Draftsman completes converting the Counter Terrorism legal framework into a Bill, it will go before the Cabinet and then tabled in Parliament when decided by the Prime Minister, the source also said. The source pointed out, with highly complex and debatable issues attached to the Counter Terrorism legislation, it is unlikely that a pluralistic community like Sri Lankas, with the history it has gone through, will ever agree on a uniform definition on the term terrorism, which is the primary challenge in drafting the Bill.
The source also said the CTA is an outcome of a dynamic assembly appointed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, chaired by the Law and Order Minister of which there were representatives from law enforcement agencies, police, security establishments, Foreign Affairs Ministry, Attorney Generals and independent lawyers with human rights orientation, and multitude of people who worked for about six months and developed a policy and legal framework of the future Counter Terrorism Act. It is extremely challenging to create a sound legislation on Counter Terrorism on par with human rights norms and standards, the government source further said.
The world over, developing counter terrorism legislation is very efficacious to meet terrorism-related challenges while ensuring that the legislation does not give rise to abuses as well as human rights violations, he said.
It is a very difficult challenge, he said. A fine balance has to be created. Some countries develop legislation which are compatible with human rights norms and standards but some of the legislation at times are weak and is not sufficiently strong to deal with the menace of terrorism.
Then there are countries that have developed strong legislation against terrorism which unfortunately gives rise to a lot of abuses and create situations that give rise to the infringement of human rights. So, striking a balance is extremely difficult, the source said.
The source pointed out that most countries have found it extremely challenging to strike a fine balance between national security requirements and the need to counter terrorism in an efficacious manner while adhering to human rights norms and standards.
He also pointed out it becomes more challenging when the entire scope of legislation is founded upon a subjective term like terrorism.
The primary challenge is to find a definition to terrorism. Up to date, the international community has been unable to agree on a definition to the word terrorism. What you or I see as terrorism, from a different political perspective may be seen but as liberation. And what we see as liberation, somebody else might see as terrorism. So this is why it is difficult to come to a unanimously agreed upon definition or legislation, he explained.
The source explained one main objective of replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act with the CTA, is that there are contemporary and emerging manifestations of terrorism that have to be responded to effectively by way of legislation as well as legislation based law enforcement actions. He explained that certain international laws require Sri Lanka to act in accordance with some requirements referred as obligations of a county.
Now some of these obligations require Sri Lanka to make laws in the field of countering terrorism. Some of those requirements have already being fulfilled by way of legislation. All the requirements are not yet being fulfilled. This is seen as an opportunity to fulfill those obligations that have not yet been fulfilled, he explained.
Preparing a CTA is also an opportunity to ensure that the laws that we develop are compatible with international human rights norms and standards. Sri Lanka also gets the opportunity to learn from countries which have strict counter-terrorism legislation and derive their experiences and from their legislation to ensure that the law that we develop meets with developed legislation in this field of counter-terrorism.

Demos, and the larger design
Laws are to be introduced to prevent the current spate of protests and demonstrations in the city impacting negatively on the economy and causing inconvenience and hardship to the public. Until such laws are introduced moves are to be worked out to restrict these demonstrations to one per week, according to the main story in a weekend vernacular newspaper.
The report also states that the decision followed a meeting between both the SLFP and UNP parliamentarians with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at the parliament complex where it was brought to his attention that the daily run of demonstrations in the city, while causing grave hardship to the public was also leaving in their wake serious economic consequences. Last week UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera also highlighted the issue in parliament and suggested designating an area for such demonstrations, to end the chaos, now being witnessed as a result of these demonstrations. The Minister noted that a new trend has been observed recently where people of different walks of life were holding protests and demonstrations which was one of the main reasons for traffic congestion. He also observed that media coverage of these demonstrations have encouraged more of their kind and if the media blackout these demos, the protesters would stop taking to the streets.
Those behind these protests obviously aim to create the maximum damage to the government and will not take kindly to being relegated to some isolated corner in the city. After all, these demonstrations are for public consumption and if the police fire tear gas and baton charge the protestors, so much the better. But things are certainly getting out of hand. Like Minister Amaraweera noted protests have now become commonplace, with the agitators only puppets craftily manipulated by sinister political forces.
Things certainly can only hot up in the coming days, with doctors, nurses port workers, farmer organsations etc. planning to stage massive demonstrations against SAITM. How, the private medical college can relate to farmers, only those behind the planned protests will be able to explain, except that it is a well orchestrated attempt by interested parties, with political backing, to cause chaos and disrupt public life on the one hand and target the economy on the other. Last Thursdays demonstration against SAITM, had, even little schoolchildren holding up placards bearing cryptic slogans which clearly was the work of some mature hand. There was also a candle light procession comprising, almost entirely, of young girls, most of whom, obviously were still in the junior forms of their schools, to whom, the issue surrounding the SAITM would no doubt have been Greek. What is today being witnessed has an uncanny resemblance to the time in the late eighties where schoolchildren were brought onto the streets to protest against the Indo-Lanka Accord by the JVP. Now, with ECTA to be signed in the coming months, there is no doubt that those behind the current spate of protests will stoop to any level, using even school children, to realise their sinister agendas and the government had better be prepared for any eventuality. The protests are also bound to snowball to coincide with the Provincial Council elections that are soon to be held, because it is obvious that regime change is what the masterminds of these protests are after. We say this because the SAITM issue was in existence from 2011, and, except for some feeble protests by the good doctors, never was there demonstrations of the scale and intensity that we are witnessing today.
It will be clear to anyone that these protests are well funded. It is difficult to mobilse the agitations, now on show, without massive financial support. The ultimate objective is to make the government unpopular by a demonstration of numbers and eventually its ouster. The economy too will be another obvious target in this grand plan. Minister Champika Ranawaka the other day stated that the government was losing Rs. 230 billion a year due to the fuel wasted in traffic jams. What this will come to, with the traffic jams we now see, almost on a daily basis in the city, can only be imagined. The government should try to ascertain who is funding these demonstrations which are well organised and systematically planned to cause the maximum damage to the government. The highly expensive posters, plastered countrywide announcing these demos and carrying other anti government slogans, can only be possible from massive funding. Are the funds coming from the billions accumulated by defeated VIP politicians and their former financiers Are university students and little schoolchildren being used as a cats paw in a grand design by those ousted from power to make a comeback The funds it appears seems inexhaustible given the frequency of these street protests. The situation can only further deteriorate, if the government keeps on hedging, without taking firm action in this regard. As already mentioned, Trade Unions are girding their loins for a massive showdown. Designating a specific area for demonstrations is only part of the solution. The government should get wise to the undercurrents of these protests and agitations.

Dr. Pathirana calls on govt to ensure MPs freedom of expression
Under the so-called Lichchavi type administration of the government, even the freedom of expression of Parliamentarians is deprived in the national assembly, Galle District Parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirana said.
He was speaking at a public gathering of Joint Opposition supporters at Bataduwa in Akmeemana, Galle recently.
When they came to power, they promised to ensure good governance of Lichchavi model under which all could assemble united, discuss in unity and adjourn peacefully. Nevertheless, in contrast to all such promises, the present government does not allow independent Parliamentarians to express their views freely even in Parliament. This is a strange type of Lichchavi rule where peoples representatives are dragged out of the chamber when they try to enjoy their legitimate right of expression, he said.
The leader of the Joint Opposition, Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardana was suspended from Parliament with the consent of the Opposition Leader under the Lecchavi method, he added.
Our political identity could be preserved only if we work as independent members without enjoying luxuries, ministerial perks and privileges. By being ministers of the government, we cannot rightful testify our political forte. Only by acting as independent members can we uphold our usual political courage and strength. The present government is steering the country towards a gloomy and disastrous end through a ruinous economic policy of selling all our precious national assets to foreigners, Dr. Pathirana said.
Galle District Parliamentarian Mohan P. de Silva, Southern Provincial Councillors Krishantha Pushpakumara, Ariyawansa Shammu and Akmeemana Pradeshiya Sabha former Vice Chairman Milinda Haputantri also participated.

Eleanor Roosevelts life and loves
Eleanor Roosevelt, distant cousin and then wife of the American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  architect of the New Deal and the man who led his country out of depression and into the Second World War  was one of the outstanding women of the twentieth century.
Biographies of outstanding public figures used to be written to inspire and impress; now, they are written as much to explore human fallibility as to celebrate achievement. It is not easy for contemporary biographers to do both, especially when, for example, early reticence about a marriage gives way to a tide of revelation and speculation. Both these books work hard to achieve the right balance.
Eleanor Roosevelt, distant cousin and then wife of the American President Franklin Delano Roosevelt  architect of the New Deal and the man who led his country out of depression and into the Second World War  was one of the outstanding women of the twentieth century.
Extraordinary relationship
Then and now regarded as his moral compass, she became a national and international celebrity in her own right, a campaigner and communicator who transformed, even if only temporarily, the role of First Lady of the United States, with her energetic dedication to progressive and humanitarian causes. She and her husband had an extraordinary relationship, both personally and politically; quite how extraordinary has taken some time, and the gradual release of much private correspondence, to become clear. Both books under review take the crucial question about any political marriage  the extent to which the couples private life affected their conduct of public affairs  further than ever before. Blanche Wiesen Cook has been working on her comprehensive biography of Eleanor Roosevelt for over a quarter of a century. The first part appeared in 1993, the second in 2000; both won prizes and much praise.
This is the third and final volume, taking her subject through the war and the death of her husband in 1945 and her last years working for the United Nations; as in the first two, Cook tells the story as a straightforward, detailed, blow-by-blow narrative. This approach could have seemed old-fashioned and dull, but her deftness in selecting and handling her rich material makes it consistently absorbing.
It also ensures that private matters, whether family or romantic, are always seen in the context of the demands of the Roosevelts demanding and dizzyingly complex political activities.
ER and FDR (as Cook calls them) have enormous archives, and many previous accounts have been written, mostly by their admirers, although there have been those whose right-wing predilections made them more critical.
Pressure groups
Cook acknowledges from the start that as a lifelong left-wing activist and feminist herself, with a long history of support for pressure groups such as the Womens International League for Peace and Freedom, she has always regarded ER as an inspiration. She is too scrupulous a historian to let this significantly affect her account, which does not present ER as a paragon; but it does sometimes affect her prose, which can slip into heroine worship. And it is indicative that an unattractive episode from ERs later life, when she behaved badly in public to a woman senator during a disagreement over the Suez crisis  first shouting at her and then refusing to shake hands  is related not in the body of the text, but almost casually, in the preface.
Key moments
In the first chapter of the book, Lady Great Heart, Cook conveys the substance of the previous volumes, sketches in key moments and relationships and gives us a sense of what is to come. Her admiration is clear from the outset. Everywhere she went, ER offered hope. Her interest and concern empowered impoverished communities and healed the wounded. ERs empathy for those in trouble went back to her childhood, which had left her, by her own admission, in desperate need of love and attention. Both the alcoholic father she adored and her chilly, critical mother were dead by the time she was ten, and the happiest period of her youth was spent at Allenswood boarding school in England, where the first of her strong emotional connections with independent, unconventional women was formed. Cook credits Marie Souvestre, the French headmistress who also taught Virginia Woolf and Lytton Stracheys clever sisters (one of whom put her experiences into the once scandalous novel of schoolgirl passion, Olivia), with recognizing ERs character and intelligence and rebuilding her confidence, preparing her for a life of endless learning, passionate intensity and surprising romance.
The other defining episode in ERs earlier life, Cook reminds us, came in 1918 when, having had six children and after thirteen years of marriage to her handsome, ambitious cousin, she discovered his affair with her friend and social secretary, Lucy Mercer. ER agreed not to divorce him on condition that marital sex cease (she apparently told her daughter later that it had always been an ordeal), that he allow her to build her own social and political life, and that he never see Mercer again. The first two conditions held; as this volume shows, the third did not.
As Cook  here and elsewhere unafraid of clich  says of Eleanor: She would forgive, but she would never forget. The bargain with her husband ensured that their partnership, for the most part affectionate and mutually supportive, endured. She looked after him with devotion during the illness that left him partly paralysed in 1921, and was always concerned about his health: she turned a blind eye to his flirtations and permitted his secretary, Missy Le Hand, to become virtually a junior wife. Cook maintains that FDR would only ask her to moderate her opinions and actions for reasons of state, sometimes national, sometimes international; and when he did, she complied. Above all, their agreement released ER to move into public life, pursue the causes dear to her heart, and make new friendships, most of them with able, politically active women, several of them in stable same-sex relationships.
Racial equality
Two couples were especially important to her from the 1920s onwards. Esther Lape and Elizabeth Read, leading campaigners for workers and womens rights and racial equality, who lived in New York and were deeply involved in the Democratic Party, were her political touchstones, and Marion Dickerman and Nancy Cook became her colleagues and companions at Val-Kill, the communal house, school and furniture workshop on the Roosevelt estate on the Hudson. Val-Kill became ERs retreat from the formality of the family home, Hyde Park, and FDRs formidable mother.
Racial equality
FDR called it the love nest. ERs core emotional team, consisted, according to Cook, of those four as well as Malvina Thompson, her devoted gatekeeper and secretary; Earl Miller, a young state trooper who taught her to ride and play tennis; and, from 1932, Lorena Hickok, known as Hick, a leading reporter who covered her arrival in the White House that year, fell deeply in love with her and was soon, as Cook rather primly puts it, ERs primary companion. It was Hick who encouraged her commitment to the New Deal, accompanied her on tours to deprived parts of the country, and helped her to establish her nationally syndicated column, My Day.
ERs romantic friendship with Hick has been known about since their correspondence became available to researchers in 1978 (they exchanged more than 3,000 letters). The first reaction was shock, and the suggestion that the collection should be closed. Since then, writers  including Cook  have been more open and sympathetic, while still holding back from asserting that ER and Hick had for a while, as the letters certainly indicate, a passionate physical relationship. Now Susan Quinn, herself in a long-standing lesbian partnership, has been able to write an account that takes love between two women for granted  although she still meets people who cannot believe ER was susceptible to it. - Times Literary Supplement

Export earnings decline, trade deficit widens in November
Sri Lankas external sector has recorded a modest performance in November 2016 with the trade deficit widening as a result of higher import expenditure amidst a decline in export earnings,the Central Bank said.
The significant increase in import expenditure in November 2016 was mainly due to the increase in expenditure on intermediate and investment goods. Earnings from tourism continued to record a healthy growth while workers remittances declined marginally during the month.
The government securities market witnessed a net outflow in the month of November, while net inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) and long term loan proceeds to the government supported the Balance of Payments (BOP) in November 2016.
Earnings from exports at US dollars 810 million in November 2016 declined by 3.4 per cent from US dollars 838 million in November 2015, reversing the year-on-year increasing trend observed during the past three months. Agricultural exports, led by minor agricultural products, spices and tea and industrial exports led by textiles and garments and gems, diamonds and jewellery, mainly contributed to this contraction.
Earnings from agricultural exports, which account for about 23 per cent of total exports, declined by 8.3 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 183 million in November 2016. Earnings from minor agricultural product exports declined substantially by 63.2 per cent, year-on-year, mainly due to the decline in edible nuts owing to lower seasonal supply while spices exports contracted by 25.4 per cent with significant decline in pepper and cinnamon exports.
Earnings from tea exports, declined by 6.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 101 million, reflecting lower export volume, despite the increase in average export prices by 20.4 per cent in November 2016, which has been increasing continuously since August 2016. However, total earnings from seafood exports increased by 18.2 per cent, year-on-year, in November 2016, continuing its impressive growth performance since the lifting of the ban on seafood exports from Sri Lanka to the European Union (EU).
Seafood exports to the EU market grew substantially by 171.2 per cent, year-on-year. Earnings from industrial exports, which account for about 77 per cent of total exports, declined by 2.0 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 624 million in November 2016. Export earnings from textile and garments, which account for around 47 per cent of total export earnings, declined by 6.6 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 383 million in November 2016, reflecting lower garment exports to both traditional and non-traditional markets.

Farmers to be compensated for loss of income due to weather
Farmers who cultivated amid unruly weather and climatic conditions, and those didn't cultivate their land due to the scarcity of water will be paid compensation from the first week of April, said Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He was addressing the ceremony to commence renovation of the dilapidated road from Galnewa to Halmillewa recently.
He said, earlier, the Grama Niladari and Agriculture Research Officers prepared the list of drought-hit farmer families ignoring those who possessed a vehicle such as a tractor or if there was an employed member in the family. All circulars which required such information have been cancelled and only the cultivation losses would be taken into account for the purpose of compensation on the basis of Rs. 40,000 per victimized family.
The minister said that the President was personally involved in taking such optimistic decisions for the benefit of aggrieved farmers. Dissanayake said a new farmer-friendly crop insurance methodology would be effected from next Yala to pay a substantial compensation for crop losses to farmers. Under the new scheme, compensation would be measured on the basis of the harvest the farmer would have secured if there was no crop failure. In the circumstances, the insurance of paddy lands would be declared compulsory and only those who insured their farm lands would be granted fertilizer subsidy in the future, the minister said.

French connections
Every year in March the world celebrates the mois de la Francophonie (Francophone culture month). The expression Francophonie refers to the global community of French-speaking people who promote special ties among all of Frances colonial ambitions with other nations in its history. It represents one of the biggest linguistic zones in the world with more than 274 million people speaking French. Its members dont share only language, but also humanist values.
A series of cultural, educational and scientific events which aim to promote francophone cultures will be held across the world throughout the month. These events are held to celebrate the cultural creativity and diversity of the francophone countries.
Over the past few years Bonjour Cinema!, the Francophone Film Festival in Sri Lanka, has become an increasingly popular event among local movie buffs. Every year, the festival attracts large audiences. This year, Bonjour Cinema! 2017 will be held from March 15 to 19 at the BMICH cinema hall, Colombo, and on March 18 and 19 at the Queens Hotel, Kandy. It is organized by the Embassy of France, the Embassy of Switzerland, the Embassy of Vietnam, Wallonie-Bruxelles international represented by the Consulte of Belgium, the Canadian High Commission, the Consulte of Tunisia and the Alliance Francaise de Kotte in association with the Bandaranaike center for International Studies (BCIS) and agenda 14. This year marks the 12th edition of the event which brings the latest and diversified movies produced in member countries of the International Organisation of La Francophonie (OIF) into the limelight.
Bonjour Cinema! 2017 will be held under the patronage of the internationally acclaimed actress Swarna Mallawarachchi who recently won a Lifetime Achievement Award at the 23rd Vesoul International Film Festival (VIFF) of Asian Cinema in France. She has also won the Best Actress Award 26 times and has been a UNHCR Ambassador for Womens Rights.
Speaking at the event held to brief the media about Bonjour Cinema! 2017 the French Ambassador to Sri Lanka and the Maldives Jean Marin Schuh noted that cinema is a powerful medium which builds up a platform of expression, and encourages creation.
Bonjour Cinema! was initiated in 2005 and is now deeply rooted in the cultural agenda of Colombo. It has grown from strength to strength over the years. This year you can expect more of everything: great movies, places and people, at the event. We have brought down some of the latest award winning high quality movies from France, Switzerland, Vietnam, Belgium, and Tunisia, he said.
All the films will be presented with English subtitles, enabling the audience to experience different aspects of the Francophone world through cinema. Entrance is free. Aiming at bringing free cultural activities that entertain, educate and improve cross-cultural understanding, to both Sri Lanka and the international community, the festival will also present short films made by Sri Lankan filmmakers before each film.
The festival will open with the French film La French on March 15. This event is only for invitees.

Love Songs (French: Les Chansons damour) is a 2007 French musical film directed by Christophe Honor, starring Louis Garrel, Ludivine Sagnier, Clotilde Hesme and Chiara Mastroianni. It was one of the 20 films selected for the main competition at the 2007 Cannes Film Festival.
Its a contemporary (timeless) film about human relationships. The humor in this film is typically French. The music is also a key element in the film and gives it a Parisian melancholical aura. The music is often used by two or more characters in the form of a dialog where they show their feelings and points of view. As they sing, the scenes are incredible well filmed either outdoor, in the endless avenues of Paris, or indoor in the cosiness of a warm bed in a cold winter night.
9 month stretch (9 mois ferme)

Stars: Sandrine Kiberlain, Albert Dupontel, Nicolas Mari
9 Month Stretch (French: 9 mois ferme) is a 2013 French comedy film written, directed by and starring Albert Dupontel. It was nominated for six categories at the 39th Csar Awards including Best Film and Best Director and Best Actor for Dupontel, winning Best Actress for its co-star Sandrine Kiberlain and Best Original Screenplay.
Albert Dupontel in Odette Toulemonde is more than brilliant. The story, albeit completely unlikely, is funny, silly, smart and just a great movie you can only come out smiling. Both principal actors do a marvelous job and you will not be disappointed. The Artists Jean Dujardin makes an appearance as the funniest, nonsensical hearing impaired translator on the local TV news channel. See it and laugh. Enjoy!

Is Garfield a boy or a girl cat
We know the lazy feline loves lasagne and hates Mondays but people have just realised theres something quite major they dont know about Garfield.
Last week a fierce debate broke out between fans abut Garfields gender, forcing creator Jim Davis to intervene and clarify once and for that Garfield is a boy.
The hot topic surfaced after writer Virgil Texas came across an interview Jim had given with Mental Floss in 2014 in which he said: By virtue of being a cat, really, hes not really male or female or any particular race or nationality, young or old. It gives me a lot more latitude for the humour for the situations.
Virgil tweeted the quote along with the message: FACT: Garfield has no gender. This. Is. Canon.
Virgil then took the dramatic action of updating Garfields Wikipedia page to include the new information about him being gender neutral.
And so it started Twitter was in uproar after what they considered to be hasty edits and people took to the page to change Garfields gender back resulting in a 60-hour-long to and fro according to The Washington Post.
Wikipedia stepped in to shut it down, locking the edits on the page.
Some editors listed times when the cat had been called he or him or even good boy in the comic while opposition claimed that it didnt matter and the gender section should be taken down.
Vigil rounded things off with this response: If one could locate another source where Jim Davis states, as explicitly as he states in the Mental Floss article, that Garfields gender is male or female, then this would give rise to a serious controversy in Garfield canon.
Yet no such source has been identified, and I highly doubt one will ever emerge.
It seemed all this was too much for Garfield creator Jim Davis who told The Washington Post: Garfield is male.
The 71-year-old cartoonist expanded, pointing out that Garfield has a girlfriend, Arlene, and said that his 2014 comments had been taken out of context.

Germany promises continued support for tourism development
Sri Lanka is targeting 150,000 German tourists this year. This was revealed during a meeting between Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunge and Germanys Federal Economic Affairs and Energy Minister Brigitte Zypries on the sidelines of the ongoing ITB in Berlin. Zypries is also Germanys Tourism Minister.
Federal Minister Zypries assured Minister Amaratunga that Germany will extend its fullest co-operation to develop Sri Lankas tourism industry since the country is now considered one of the safest destinations for European travellers. German travellers are always talking about the warm hospitality and friendliness of the Sri Lankan people. They are very eager to return to the country over and over again, Minister Zypries said.
Minister Amaratunga thanked the German government for supporting tourism development in Sri Lanka. The Minister noted that Sri Lanka received 134,275 German tourists last year indicating a growth of 15% compared to the previous year. He said that ITB will be used as a stepping stone to carry out an aggressive tourism promotion campaign in Germany this year.
It was further revealed during the discussions that Sri Lanka Tourism has already embarked on a promotional campaign focusing on different regions in Germany.

Guru.lk chosen to produce official E textbook
Guru.lk, Sri Lankas leading eLearning portal has been chosen by the Educational Publications Department of the Ministry of Education to produce the first official E textbook to support the governments efforts to promote learning in a digital format in schools.
The assignment, awarded via competitive tender, requires Guru.lk to develop original content for the GCE Ordinary Level Science syllabus, using visually stimulating graphics, videos and interactive content that maximises the effectiveness of engaging and collaborative learning via computers, tabs and other devices.
This approach is intended to enable students to learn much more in a shorter time span with the assistance of their teachers as well as through self-study, and lead to greater use of the computer labs in schools across the country. It is also scaled to accommodate the use of students own digital devices in the future. This is in line with the Governments vision to digitally empower its citizens for development to trickle down to the masses.
The introduction of E textbooks will also improve the quality of learning experience for students, and update and upgrade teacher knowledge. The ease of distribution will facilitate wider access to students, and the platform makes amendment and updating of content easy.
Commenting on the award of the first E textbook assignment to Guru.lk, HasithaDela, CEO ofHeadstart, the company that owns Guru.lk said: It gives us great pleasure to be selected for this project of national interest.
Headstart and Guru.lk have always strived to improve the quality and accessibility of education for the masses. Being selected as the official E textbook provider in the very first such project by the Educational Publications Department is the best opportunity to achieve a goal we have had from the day we started our company in 2009.
The introduction of E textbooks is seen as an important step in the governments efforts to get ICT in to education to keep up with global requirements, and as a milestone in the local educationalpublications field as it will change the way education is delivered to students.
Headstart, the owner of www.guru.lk has been developing content for the ICTA/Ministry of Education on school curricula since 2009.
The company was a tech start-up with a project named Vidunena under which the GCE A/L Science curriculum was provided to schools in an E Learning format, through an ICTA grant. The company now owns the largest E Learning content portal in Sri Lanka with more than 235,000 learners and 1,000 plus lessons to choose from.
The content knowledge pool includes university academics, teachers, business leaders, corporate trainers and soft skills trainers, and is the largest such education-related talent pool in Sri Lanka.

Is the gym the best place to exercise
A new study says gym-goers are indeed fitter and healthier than non-members. But there are other ways to stay fit, and some of them may be even more beneficial [strap]
The most popular New Year resolution in almost every survey is exercise more  which often translates into joining a gym. According to the 2016 State of the UK Fitness Industry report, one in seven people in the UK are members. But are they more likely to be fit The solution
A study last week in the journal Plos One found that gym members were 14 times more aerobically active than people who didnt belong to any health club. Gym members, on average, did six hours more exercise a week, and this activity did make them fitter than non-members. They had lower heart-rates, smaller waists and higher levels of cardiovascular fitness as measured by heart strength, lung function and muscle mass. They also spent less time sitting down every day than non-gym members. The results were similar for men and women. Raise the bar: a beginner's guide to lifting weights
The study included 405 people between the ages of 30 to 64, and the general characteristics of those who were gym members were similar to those who were not.
The lead author, Elizabeth C Schroeder of the department of kinesiology and nutrition at the University of Illinois, says that gym members were also more likely than non-members  even those who did exercise  to do resistance training which strengthens muscles, reduces blood pressure and can increase metabolic rates.
While it might seem obvious that gym members exercise more, and are healthier than non-members, Schroeder says this has not previously been explicitly shown.
This study adds actual objective measures of people at a health club compared with non-members, which has not been measured prior [to now], she says. However, the study is only designed to show a link between gym membership and more exercise  it may be that active people are just more likely to join gyms. People in the study who exercised as much as gym members had similar reductions in cardiovascular risk factors.
You can get broadly the same benefit wherever you exercise.
This study shows a gym membership makes it more likely youll do so, but other research shows that exercising outside has other benefits. Outdoor activity can boost your vitamin D levels, reduce tension and depression, and make you feel more revitalised and positive about life  especially if you run through a forest. Outdoor exercise is also rated as more enjoyable and less of an effort than going to the gym. The first five minutes of outdoor exercise are particularly effective at making people feel good. But Schroeder says that a gym may also encourage greater exercise because it can be social and fun.

Turnover and market capitalisation
JKH was the highest contributor to the weeks turnover value, contributing LKR 0.585Bn or 14.99% of total turnover value. Melstacorp followed suit, accounting for 14.86% of turnover (value of LKR 0.580Bn) while NDB contributed LKR 0.39Bn to account for 10.09% of the weeks turnover.
Total turnover value amounted to LKR 3.90Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 6.13Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.78Bn (-36.35% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 1.23Bn.
Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 0.27% W-o-W (or LKR 7.25Bn) to LKR 2,672.12Bn cf. LKR 2,679.37Bn last week.
Liquidity (in value terms)
The Diversified Sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 36.53% (or LKR 1.43Bn) of market turnover.
Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH, Melstacorp & Hemas Holdings which accounted for 93.05% of the sectors total turnover.
The Bank, Finance & Insurance Sector meanwhile accounted for 27.66% (or LKR 1.08Bn) of the total turnover value with turnover driven primarily by NDB, Commercial and Sampath Banks which accounted for 79.46% sector turnover.
The Beverage, Food & Tobacco Sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 9.54% (or LKR 0.37Bn) to the market. The sector turnover was driven by Cold Stores which accounted for 77.38% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in volume terms)
The Diversified Sector dominated the market in terms of share volume too, accounting for 25.71% (or 24.05Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.43Bn.
The Bank, Finance & Insurance sector followed suit, adding 22.24% to total turnover volume as 20.80Mn shares were exchanged.
The sectors volume accounted for LKR 1.08Bn of total market turnover value. The Telecommunication Sector meanwhile, contributed 15.93Mn shares (or 17.03%), amounting to LKR 0.18Bn.
Top gainers and losers
Kotmale Holdings was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 22.46% W-o-W from LKR 60.10 to LKR 73.60.

In terms of volume, Dialog Axiata and Expolanka Holdings led foreign purchases while Teejay Lanka & Peoples Leasing led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Commercial Bank & Melstacorp led foreign purchases while Teejay Lanka & Chevron foreign sales.
Point of view
Institutional and HNI interest continued to drive markets this week, as crossings in Blue-chips, Diversifieds and mid-caps accounted for ~52% of market turnover. Although lower than last weeks ~72%, the proportion remains higher than the typical weekly average of ~35-40%.
Investor interest was driven predominantly by JKH (25% of crossings), Melstacorp (24% of crossings), NDB (16% of crossings), Dialog (7% of crossings) and mid-caps such as CCS (8% of crossings), RHL (7%) and LION (3% of crossings).
Foreign inflows to equities which have been consistent since early Feb and which have gathered pace since late Feb also drove market activity over the week, helping ease losses on the Index.
Despite the interest from HNI, Institutional and Foreign Investors though, the benchmark price Index fell steadily over the week, falling below the 6100-mark for the first time in a month.
Nevertheless the pace of decline eased over the week as positive earnings along with the IMFs review and S&Ps credit ratings impacted sentiment. In its latest meeting to review its economic reform program with Sri Lanka, the IMF commended the authorities for meeting the December fiscal quantitative targets and for progress in improving revenue collection and automating revenue administration.
The Group noted though that the countrys net international reserves were short of the target as some of the structural reforms were lagging behind original timelines.
S&P meanwhile, affirmed Sri Lankas B+/B ratings while maintaining its negative outlook due to the countrys vulnerability to external shocks amid high external debt and low FX reserves.
Markets in the week ahead are likely to remain largely driven by Institutional and HNI investors as Retailers continue to adopt a watchful stance.
Cumulative 9m earnings rise 20% Y-o-Y
Market earnings over the December 2016 quarter rebounded strongly, helping push the trailing 12-month earnings of the market up by 24% Y-o-Y.
Total corporate earnings1 for the quarter rose 28% Q-o-Q and 34% Y-o-Y to Rs. 74Bn (cf. Rs. 58Bn in Sep16 and Rs. 48Bn in Jun16 quarter) driven mainly by Telcos which recovered from large FX losses and Banks & Finance and Diversifieds which benefitted from strong earnings performance in JKH and VONE.
From a cumulative 9-month2 perspective meanwhile, total market earnings rose to Rs. 177Bn, up 20% Y-o-Y from the Rs. 147Bn recorded a year ago. Robust earnings growth stemmed from sectors such as Telecom, Banks & Finance and Manufacturing although sectors such as Beverage, Food & Tobacco and Construction recorded losses over the period. Corporate earnings over the quarter reflect the mixed macroeconomic performance in H216; performance over the period has been mixed as the gradual improvement in growth has been accompanied by an uptick in inflation due to the drought impact and higher consumption-based tax increases (ie: VAT).
Nevertheless, the stronger earnings performance over the quarter helped push the market PER lower to 12.5x relative to 14.1x in the comparable period in 2015 and lower than the average PER levels of both its Frontier Market Peers (MSCI FM Index PER : 14.4x) and Emerging market peers (MSCI EM Index PER: 15.5x).
The ASPI has however, under-performed its peers over 2017, declining 1.7% YTD3relative to the MSCI EM (+7.1% YTD) and MSCI FM (+5.4% YTD).

Import of chemical fertiliser increases
Sri Lanka has imported 5.4 million metric tonnes and 2 million litres of chemical fertiliser from 2010 to 2016, according to an answer tabled by the Agriculture Ministry in Parliament last week.
The answer was tabled in response to a question by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake.
As of the answer, there is a reduction of 381,232 MT in importation of chemical fertiliser to the country in 2016 compared to the quantity imported in 2015. The liquid volume of chemical fertiliser importation has increased by 54,801 litres last year compared to 2015.
The solid chemical fertiliser importation to the country stood at 1,038,641 MT in 2010, 866,507 MT in 2011, 748,902 MT in 2012, 605,068 MT in 2013, 767,510 MT in 2014, 893,872 MT in 2015, and 512,640 MT in 2016.
The liquid chemical fertiliser importation stood at 187,425 litres in 2010, 213,074 in 2011, 245,741 in 2012, 348,838 in 2013, 287,352 in 2014, 357,936 in 2015, and 412,737 litres in 2016.
The Government has distributed a total of 1.8 million MT of chemical fertiliser as subsidies for paddy cultivation from 2010 to 2015. Instead of issuing subsidised fertiliser, cash grants are issued from the Yala season 2016.
According to the answer, the production of organic fertiliser has dropped by 61,017 MT last year compared to that of in 2015. This quantity was 70,787 MT in 2016 and 131,804 MT in 2015.

Jaffna Diocese refuses request for postponement
The Tamil Nadu coordinator for the Kachchativu St. Anthonys festival Fr. Sahayaraj had asked for a postponement of the event fixed for Sunday, but the Jaffna Diocese had informed him that it could not be postponed for reasons beyond their control, reliable sources in the Tamil Nadu Catholic church told the New Indian Express.
However, personnel of the Jaffna Diocese could not be contacted to confirm this. According to sources, Fr.Sahayaraj had on Thursday, sought from the Jaffna Diocese through an email, a postponement of the festival in view of the growing fishermens agitation in Tamil Nadu over the killing of a young Rameswaram fishermen allegedly by a Sri Lankan naval rating on Monday.
The Diocese came back to Fr.Sahayaraj later in the day, with a negative reply. Arrangements continued to be made by the Sri Lankan Navy to receive 4991 pilgrims from Tamil Nadu with dinner packets for Saturday evening and breakfast and lunch on Sunday. In the normal course, the pilgrims would have attended the main mass on Sunday at 9 am, had lunch and sailed back to Tamil Nadu later in the afternoon.
Earlier in the day on Saturday, a Sri Lankan Catholic priest involved in organizing St. Anthonys Feast, told a Sri Lankan TV channel that the pilgrims want to come for it but are being prevented by the agitators.
The agitators are asking for the arrest of the Sri Lankan navy man; have rejected the compensation offered by the Tamil Nadu government; and are insisting that Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj should see them and give them a concrete assurance that the guilty Sri Lankan navy man is arrested and there will be no more shootings.
But neither Swaraj nor any of the other two junior External Affairs ministers have come.
The on-going election process in Uttar Pradesh is cited as the reason for the ministers inability to respond. That the Indian government has not issued a single statement condemning the killing and expressing sorrow is a major grievance of the fishermen.
The Sri Lankan government has already denied that its navy had done the shooting as the shooting is alleged to have happened on the Indian side of the Maritime Boundary Line, which the Sri Lankan navy never crosses. However, the government has announced a thorough inquiry based on GPS data which will hopefully prove that no Sri Lankan naval vessel was on the Indian side of the IMBL. But the fishermen contend that the bullets recovered were from a military Self-Loading Rifle (SLR).
Sri Lanka is yet to set up a court of inquiry or say how the matter will be investigated. Due to the intervention of Indias Vice President Hamid Ansari who took up the issue with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena in Indonesia on the sideline of the recent Indian Ocean summit, the Indian and Sri Lankan governments agreed to release fishermen held by them.
Orders were passed on Friday to release 53 of the 85 Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan custody.
On Monday, the rest will be released too. The speculation is that the Sri Lankan government will in all probability do nothing more than what it has already done (release of the fishermen but not their boats). Perhaps, it hopes that the issue will peter out in a while.
The solution probably lies in either Sushma Swaraj or a senior minister visiting the agitators and giving them an assurance that the government of India will ensue that the Sri Lankan side does not resort to the use of firearms of any kind of violence against Indian fishermen in the future as it is part of the commitment made at the Indo-Sri Lanka Joint Working Group on Fishing.

Kelani River Bridge Project enriches suburban lives
The new bridge construction project over the Kelani river financed by the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) provided an opportunity for the Sedawatta and Wadullawatta communities to build their lives.
The new bridge runs parallel to the existing bridge, and bridge piers will be located at Sedawatta and Wadullawatta. The communities have to relocate if the bridge is to be constructed. The relocation is carried out in accordance with the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and JICAs guidelines for social and environmental considerations. The affected communities are compensated based on the principles of replacement cost to enable them to have an equivalent or better living standards.
The Road Development Authority (RDA) - the implementing agency for the bridge construction project - with close cooperation from the Urban Development Authority (UDA) secured apartments for over 400 households in the UDAs Laksanda Sevana housing complex in Salamulla. The 2nd apartment block in the complex was ceremonially opened by President Maithripala Sirisena on March 2.The complex is located just a few kilometers away from the bridge, so the changes to their traveling times and surroundings are minimised. Almost the entire community opted to live in the complex, so the community ties can continue in the new site.
The project affected families receive ownership of their individual apartments on vacation of their existing premises. The apartments are larger than the houses they currently occupy and equipped with amenities including electricity and water connections. The Project Management Unit (PMU) provided them with guidance and assistance on furnishing and maintaining their apartments.An income restoration programme is currently in progress. Through this, the householders received training, equipment and micro-finance facilities to start or expand home based industries such as shoe-making, incense sticks, and dress-making among others. The PMU continues the support them to expand sales, diversify and improve quality of products and be self-sustainable.
A Montessori and day-care centre are being set up and selected residents are being trained to operate both. The PMU assisted the families to move their children to the closest school to the housing complex. During the floods in 2016 when this community was inundated, the PMU staff provided food for them by contributing portion of their salary. At Laksanda Sevana, the PMU staff set up a library for the children, again using their own personal resources. The community members feel they have gained not only new homes, but also a new family in the PMU staff.
Thirty families have already moved and settled in the first building of Laksanda Sevana. They have used the trainings they received to furnish and equip the apartments in creative and innovative ways. Their ownership and pride are evident from the efforts they have put in to convert the houses into homes. The other families are moving to the 2nd building after the ceremonial opening on March 2. The new bridge over the Kelani river will bring substantial economic benefits to Sri Lanka.
But the direct benefits to the project affected communities through conducting the resettlement according to the National Involuntary Resettlement Policy and JICAs Guidelines are of equal or higher value. Through this the lives of over 2,000 residents of Colombo has been uplifted, and definitely their contribution to the economy will rise. We hope this will be taken as an example and the same policies followed in all other public infrastructure projects, the JICA Sri Lanka Office Chief Representative Kiyoshi Amada said.

Koala bears are not actually bears
Koalas live in eastern Australia, where the eucalyptus trees they love are most plentiful. In fact, they rarely leave these trees, and their sharp claws and opposable digits easily keep them aloft. During the day they doze, tucked into forks or nooks in the trees, sleeping for up to 18 hours.
When not asleep a koala feeds on eucalyptus leaves, especially at night. Koalas do not drink much water and they get most of their moisture from these leaves. Each animal eats a tremendous amount for its sizeabout two and a half pounds of leaves a day. Koalas even store snacks of leaves in pouches in their cheeks.
A special digestive systema long gutallows koalas to break down the tough eucalyptus leaves and remain unharmed by their poison. Koalas eat so many of these leaves that they take on a distinctive odor from their oil, reminiscent of cough drops.
Population
These plump, fuzzy mammals were widely hunted during the 1920s and 1930s, and their populations plunged. Helped by reintroduction, they have reappeared over much of their former range, but their populations are smaller and scattered. Koalas need a lot of spaceabout a hundred trees per animala pressing problem as Australia's woodlands continue to shrink.

Did You Know
* Koalas usually get all the water they need from eucalyptus leaves.
* Koalas can be ferocious when resisting capture. They growl, fight, and bite.
* Koalas often return to trees they consider their territory.
* Many of Australias koalas have an STD called chlamydiosis.
* When the temperature rises, koalas press their bodies close to tree trunks, which cools them off.
* Koala twins are very rare.
* In the wild, koalas live about 10 to 15 years.

Leaves all over
Can you imagine a garden with plants without leaves It lacks lustre! The Garden has no equilibrium. Leaves have a certain beauty. One first notices their symmetry and this symmetry is what makes it attractive. It offers a certain balance to the garden. Without it, a garden makes no sense.
A flower alone is incomplete. The leaves give it proportion. The leaves offer a certain form and without this form, a flower does not have its appeal. Leaves come in a variety of shades and colors. It takes so many shapes. Plants that have attractive leaves are called Foliage plants. They have flowers but the leaves are what are most attractive. Daily News speaks to Deputy Director of Provincial Agriculture Office Ratmalana, District Agriculture Instructor G.D. Udaya Kumara on these plants who have a certain liveliness.
The floriculture industry consists of the cultivation of Foliage plants, flowering ornamentals, cut flowers and others. In Sri Lanka this is for the local and export markets. Ornamental plants are used for decorative purposes in gardens. Foliage plants are highly valued because of their multifaceted designs, said Udaya Kumara
They can be categorized into two-
 LIVE PLANTS- Plants with attractive foliage grown indoors as well as outdoors
 CUT LEAVES- Attractive leaves used to add color and shape to arrangements
Cut leaves have many purposes. They can be used for Wedding, funerals and religious functions. In Sri Lanka these cut leaves are used for the export trade. Leaves of the following plants are used for export  Cane Palm, Fishtail Palm, Queen Palm and Ladies Finger Palm, Croton, Chinese Grass, Scindapsus, Syngonium, Cordyline, Dracaenas and Anthurium, pointed out Udaya Kumara.
In many parts of the world Christmas is a special time. In European countries with the snowfall and the spirit of Christmas leaves play a special part. Cut leaves in particular. Eucalyptus leaves are said to be fragrant, calming and long lasting. Magnolia leaves are equally potent. Even in funerals leaves are used. A wreath is never the same without the leaves. Apart from artificial Christmas trees the natural ones have completely natural leaves.
When you take plants suited for the local market they include  Hibiscus, Bougainvillea, African Violets, Euphorbia Heliconia, added Udaya Kumara.
CLIMATIC CONDITIONS
 Temperature 20  32 Celsius
 Light 50  80 percent Shade
 Certain Plants such as Crotons and Hibiscus need full sunlight
 Relative Humidity 50  80 percent
According to the growing region, all types of Foliage plants can be grown in the region of Diyatalawa. In Nuwara Eliya (which is wet and cold) plants like Cyprus, Begonia, Caladium and Maranta.
In the North Central Province, which is dry and hot you can grow Hibiscus, Cacti, Palms, Euphorbia, Jatropha, Jasmine, Bougainvillea, Cycads and Ixora.
In the Southern and Western Province which is wet and hot, all foliage plant types and ornamental plants can be grown.
In Sabaragamuwa which is wet and cloudy you can grow Aglaonema, Dieffenbachia, Maranta, Calathea, Peperomia, Begonia, Scindapsus and Philodendron.
In the Central Hills of Matale and Kandy, all foliage plant types can be grown, explained Udaya Kumara.
INTERESTING FACTS ABOUT FOLIAGE PLANTS YOU MAY NOT KNOW
 Foliage plants have a very long history
 As far back as the time of the great pharaohs and the pyramids the people of ancient Egypt decorated their homes with plants.
 The Greeks and Romans built their home around a central atrium of plants
 For centuries explorers and botanists, called plant hunters searched the tropics for new and exciting plants to bring back to Europe.
Flowers come and go but if you can grow foliage plants they are more long lasting. Not only is it long lasting it gives a breathtaking view to the garden. Who can resist the lushness of the Begonia Those huge leaves of green interspersed with black Or what about the Prayer Plant. It's a fun plant for children because the leaves open and close at night. The big leaves create a nice accent to rooms and they fit in with a wide variety of decorating styles.
Most foliage plants are an interior decorators dream. The leaves add the sense of enticement when matched with the walls and its lines and colors. And not only do these foliage plants complement the surroundings, they complement each other!
There is even scientific evidence that some of these foliage plants are good for air purification. Large and dark leaves of the Anthurium suck up ammonia, formaldehyde, toluene and xylene, so theyre a thoughtful present for a workplace (especially around copiers, printers, or adhesives).

Maltas famous Azure Window rock formation collapses
A beautiful rock arch once featured as a backdrop in Game of Thrones has collapsed into the sea.
In a bid to prevent its erosion, the country had introduced fines of over 1000 for anyone caught walking across the bridge. But it was not enough to save it and it crumbled into the sea while large waves lashed it today.
It had been one of the main attractions on the island of Gozo, pictured in thousands of photo albums from tourists who visited. Malta Prime Minister Joseph Muscat described his heartbreaking sadness at the loss. No one was injured.
Geologist Peter Gatt said the limestone pillar supporting the arch gave way. He attributed the collapse to years of erosion to currents beneath the waves and rough seas.
The window also served as a backdrop in the 1981 movie Clash of the Titans.

Meeting the impending economic challenges: Some poignant posers
No policy maker, will deny the fact that Sri Lanka, at present, is facing an extremely precarious economic situation.
The looming challenge, if not prudently managed, will drive the country into negative territory in international ratings making it extremely difficult to attract foreign portfolio and direct investment. Of late, the critical nature of the situation has been highlighted by many prominent and respected economists. The following headlines that appeared in the media recently is a clear indication of this fact. Coming out of economic crisis: timing is running out for Sri Lanka, Sri Lanka is on the doorstep of a public debt driven crisis, The impact of the global financial crisis on Sri Lanka, Financial crisis in Sri Lanka.
It is not uncommon for politicians and policy makers to engage in wishful thinking and to be cautious when it comes to highlighting serious economic challenges to their citizens..
However, it is important that think tanks and policy research organizations act impartially and work to create a healthy environment for constructive public debate on the critical economic choices facing our country and society today.
Sri Lankas present economic predicament has manifested itself in many ways such as the downward pressure on the Rupee, outflow of foreign exchange while the inflows are insufficient, domestic spending induced imports and public debt-both foreign and domestic is reaching uncontrollable levels.
Furthermore, with the introduction of the so-called 100 day program to fulfill Presidential election promises, the government inter alia raised public sector salaries by RS.10,000, slashed petroleum prices locally and managed external reserves to maintain an artificially strong exchange rate. The compounded impact of these ad hoc decisions have left the country with an extremely weak macro economic framework.
It is often said that good economics makes good politics. Sadly, most governments in Sri Lanka have ignored this dictum and today the population at large is about to pay a heavy price for this irresponsibility.
Anatomy of the crisis
Our foreign debt has increased from Rs. 3113 bn. in 2014 to Rs. 4,070 bn at end September 2016. During the same period, domestic debt too has increased from Rs.4, 278 bn. to Rs.4,959 bn. Pressure on the exchange rate in spite of the futile attempts to defend the Rupee is reflected by the depreciation of the Rupee from Rs. 132 in 2005 to the current Rs. 153. The strategy of the current government is to address the demand side of the equation.
This is partly arising out of the understanding reached between the government and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). It appears that the IMF and the Government has agreed upon a set of macroeconomic targets such as budget deficit, government revenue, both from direct and indirect taxation, and non-debt official reserve build up etc. In spite of attempts to address revenue shortfalls through the increase of taxes, it appears that the desired results have not been achieved.
According to reports reserves have fallen drastically to USD 5.5 billion. If the short term borrowings are excluded from the declared reserves the net official reserves will be further reduced. The gross official reserve computation has been presented without allowing a provision to settle the USD 2.5 billion of swap arrangements with foreign and local banks.
No gain without pain: Government expenditure has to be reduced..
Due to short-term political considerations and strong opposition from the trade-unions, successive governments have made little effort at reducing the budget deficit through the pruning of government expenditure. This should have been the first line of recourse in any budgeting exercise. Over the past two years government has continued to expand in many areas for example, the already over-bloated and inefficacious public service is continually being fed with thousands of unskilled workers. Similarly, overstaffed government institutions, such as ministries, departments, and other statutory bodies have continued to spread their wings. The government has maintained unrealistic administered prices on petrol, diesel, electricity, water, etc. in spite of the fact that global oil prices have increased to USD 55/bbl and the exchange rate has depreciated from Rs 132 to 153/USD. The Increased import of motor vehicles and petroleum products and the increased use of a high cost power generation mix have raised deficits in large State owned enterprises as well. An early shift to a market based petroleum pricing formula would have been the most responsible way to condition the public towards managing the uncertainties of commodities markets.
Hard Choices : No easy options
The current predicament places the government in a difficult situation. The most urgent need for the government is to restore the fast eroding confidence on the Rupee and raising foreign exchange to ensure the availability of sufficient funds for meeting foreign debt repayment obligations. At the same time, the day-to-day foreign exchange requirement to meet import expenditure needs to be ensured. Without meeting the immediate requirement for foreign exchange, any discussion on short-term or medium-term adjustments or strategies becomes meaningless.
Now the Tough have to Get Going
The options available to the government need to be considered based on the time period available for implementation.
1. In the short run it is important that Central Bank discontinue selling its foreign exchange reserves.
The Central Bank irresponsibly burned reserves to maintain an artificially high rupee in 2015 & 2016. This has continued in January 2017 wasting hundreds of millions of dollars to defend the un-defendable Rupee. The Pathfinder Foundation has consistently and strongly criticized the Central Banks selling of reserves even during the tenure of the previous government. Selling state enterprises and attracting foreign inflows make no sense if the Central Bank keeps selling its reserves.
At the current scale of Central Bank interventions, even if the Chinese investors pay USD 1.1 billion for the Hambantota port, that amount will be enough for the Central Bank for only 2 months and the country will be back again in the same crisis situation.
The market should be allowed to determine a true rate for the rupee. Further delay will be nothing but precursor to a more drastic adjustment of the Rupee.
2. Similarly the Central Bank must refrain from Rupee market operations by not increasing in treasury bills. The Central Bank and the Government must appreciate that there are no soft options for a middle income countrys macro-economic problems. High interest rates, a depreciated currency and corresponding domestic price adjustments are unavoidable in the short run. Price controls will never bring about the desired economic stability.
3. Provided that the above points are recognized and operationalized, in the immediate term the requirement will be to generate at least $1 billion plus non-debt creating foreign exchange earnings to reduce the existing pressure on the balance of payments. Unless that immediate requirement is fulfilled the country will be forced to borrow from short-term bond markets at increasingly higher interest rates further entangling the country in a debt trap. Regrettably, the government has decided to raise USD 2.5 billion from international markets at a time global interest rates are on the rise and Sri Lankan market conditions are unstable.
4. The fastest way in which foreign reserves could be raised in an economically prudent and in an efficient manner would be through the sale of State assets. Foreign and local direct investment could be attracted to state-owned business enterprises leading to privatization or converting them to public-private partnerships. Privatisation could take the form of direct sales, corporatisation and listing them in the share market or any other form of transaction which could result in the full or partial transfer of ownership and management.
The Pathfinder Foundation in the recent past has identified potential candidates for attracting FDI for state-owned business enterprises as indicated below;Values in USD million
1. Hilton Hotel and Properties of HDL 250
2. Hyatt Regency Complex 100
3. Waters Edge 100
4. Grand Oriental Hotel 75
5. UDA Rest Houses 40
6. 50% Government Equity in LECO 100
7. Lakdhanavi (Kerawalapitiya) 300 mw power plant 300
8. Conversion of Debt into Equity of 900 mw Puttalam Coal power plant 1,000
9. Public listing of Government/SOE equity in private companies (SLPA/Government equity in SAGT, CICT, NDB, Seylan) 500
10. 30 percent Share issue of SLT 300
11. Public Listing of Mobitel 200
12. LITRO Gas 250
13. Lanka Hospital 250
14. 40 percent share issue of Sri Lanka Insurance 250
15. 99 year leases for Plantation Companies 200
16. Petroleum Retail Distribution 150
17. Hambantota Airport/Port (40 percent equity with 10 year management) 1500
18. BIA 40 percent equity and 10 year management contract) 300
Potential income 5,865 5. Outlined above is one set of State businesses for privatization. The other would be the assets of local private enterprises and businesses taken over by so called socialist / progressive governments since independence including through land reforms. The time has come to give these assets back to the respective owners to recommence proper domestic investments in agriculture. The 50 acre land ceiling is a major barrier to investments in agriculture, forestry, livestock, poultry, eco-tourism, grain, sugar, spices, fruits and vegetables etc. In the context of a middle income country context, the prevailing land ceiling should be raised to at least 500 acres for investments by domestic investors.
6. In the medium and long-term, the government has to implement economic policies that will provide greater incentives to export oriented sectors, removing the currently existing import substitution bias and restoring incentives for domestic producers instead of traders who are transferring funds abroad through over invoicing and transfer pricing. Constraints to foreign as well as local investors should be eased through the removal of regulatory and bureaucratic delays. The practice of granting tax and import duty concessions to BOI projects is a necessary condition to increasing sustainable investment provided a level playing field is created. Policy consistency too needs to be ensured in the medium term, if the flow of FDI and exports of goods and services is to be sustained.
Perceptions of Corruption
In addition to the above mentioned policy actions, a substantial flow of FDI and domestic investment will depend on the countrys image of having a corruption free economy. Sri Lankas ranking in the Transparency International Corruption Index has further worsened during the 2015/2016 period. According to the Heritage Foundation Economic Freedom Index, Sri Lanka has dropped in its ratings owing to a perception of corruption. Serious and tangible measures should be taken to change this situation,
Privatisation is a reality
The privatization of state-owned business enterprises has been a subject of debate since the liberalization of the economy which was introduced in 1977. Most, if not all the arguments against privatization have been based on ideological and parochial political grounds.
Nevertheless ideologically driven academics and intellectuals with the blessings of politicians base their arguments against privatization on the presumption that these state-owned enterprises are National Assets and therefore, should not be offered to the local or foreign private sector.
But the history of state ownership of business enterprises in Sri Lanka goes back to the days of the colonial rulers before the so-called socialist or nationalist ideologies supporting state ownership took root in the country. Therefore, it appears that the modern rhetoric based on patriotism inadvertently support the socialist actions introduced by the colonialists.
Other than colonialism induced state-owned business enterprises, there are a large number of commercial ventures which were appropriated in the name of socialism, but in practice most often it was for political victimization.
From the mid-1950s several privately owned businesses were nationalized including mass transportation, insurance, petroleum distribution, etc., creating an anti-private sector environment with an increasing bias towards capitalism and oligarchies.
During the period of 1970-77, nationalization of private business enterprises (small, medium to relatively large) took place under the declared objective of driving Sri Lanka towards socialism. At the end of this period even the Buhari hotel ended up in State hands ! When the then government chose to sell this asset, political pressures were such that it had to be sold to the ruling partys trade unions.
Of course, now assets back to the private sector which created these enterprises to begin with is also argued as giving away national assets. In the recent past assets that were forcibly taken from the original private owners are Waters Edge, Sri Lanka Insurance and Lanka Hospitals. Why is the government reluctant to give back or sell these properties At least they should be corporatizee where necessary and shares sold in the stock market.
Other than nationalized business enterprises, there are also a set of projects created through foreign financing - among them are the Hambantota Port, Mattala International Airport and the Norchcholai Coal Power Plant.
Privatisation of Norochcholai coal power plant and negotiating a power purchase agreement similar to the AES Kelanitissa Power Station and other private power supply agreements will certainly be beneficial to the CEB and the country. Proper power purchase agreements should be worked out taking into past experience. A credible regulatory framework should be put in place without government interference. The privatization of these enterprises will attract not only much needed investment, both foreign and local, but it will also enhance the efficiency of management, introduce cost efficient procurement systems, eliminate corruption and, in the final analysis provide Sri Lankan consumers with better choices. This process in turn will increase the overall efficiency and competitiveness of the economy.
The best example in this regard is the privatisation of Sri Lanka Telecom by inducing foreign capital, management and technology. The entire mobile telephone sector (except Mobitel) is currently owned and managed by foreign capital which has become a blessing to successive governments and customers. This sector contributes handsomely to government revenues.
However, lessons should be learnt from the bad experiences of certain privatization, eg. Plantations sugar, transport etc. In order to prevent corruption, malpractices or simply policy mistakes, an independent privatization task force with eminent professionals must be set up to undertake fast track privatization.
Conclusion
Sri Lanka is currently facing the enviable challenge of rejuvenating the economy while maintaining measures for fiscal consolidation, stabilization of the economy and repayment of the foreign and local debts. The privatization of enterprises and thereby attracting much needed non-debt creating foreign capital is a necessary requisite.
However, this is not sufficient to maintain Sri Lanka at a higher growth trajectory. In order to ensure that the country maintains solid and stable growth, the privatization of state-owned business enterprises is a necessary condition, but may not be a means to an end. Prudent economic policies, consistency in maintaining such policies, uplifting our position in the World Bank Doing Business Index as well as the further improvement of infrastructure has to be vigorously pursued in the medium term.
Privatization devoid of economic reforms, structural change, prudent economic management and the elimination of corruption will not result in the desired outcome.

Ministry of Foreign Affairs clarifies erroneous news report

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has issued a clarification on a report carried in a newspaper on March 8, titled UN resolutions not binding on Sovereign Nations  Govt., which it said had misquoted Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs Harsha de Silva.
Issuing a statement, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said '...What the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs set out to explain and clarify isthatwhat Sri Lanka will undertake at the current34thsession,is atwo-year extension of the timeline forfulfilmentof commitments made in Resolution 30/1, andthat there will be no additional or new commitments arising fromthe High Commissioners Report to this current 34thSession.'
The full statement issued by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in reproduced below:
During the Government headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, the Human Rights Council, on 27 March 2014, adopted Resolution 25/1 titledPromoting reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka, requesting the High Commissioner, inter alia, to undertake a comprehensive investigation into alleged serious violations and abuses of human rights and related crimes by both parties in Sri Lanka during the period covered by the LLRC, and to establish the facts and circumstances of such alleged violations and of the crimes perpetrated with a view to avoiding impunity and ensuring accountability, with assistance from relevant experts and special procedures mandate holders.
Following this request of the Council, the High Commissioner launched the OHCHR Investigation on Sri Lanka (OISL), a first of this nature carried out by an external entity on matters pertaining to Sri Lanka. Moreover, further international action was being envisaged on Sri Lanka as a result of the Governments inaction on matters pertaining to rule of law, reconciliation, and governance, at the time the Presidential Election was held on 8 January 2015.
Following the Presidential election on 8 January 2015, the National Unity Government of Sri Lanka, under the leadership of President Mathripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, took steps to take ownership of reconciliation, rule of law, accountability, human rights and governance issues.
As a result, when the OISL Report and the High Commissioners Report were presented at the 30thSession of the Council in September 2014, the Human Rights Council, having paid heed to the responsible manner in which the Unity Government had embarked on handling matters pertaining to reconciliation, accountability, human rights, rule of law and governance, adopted Resolution 30/1 on 1 October 2015, co-sponsored by Sri Lanka as well,clearly placing the Government of Sri Lanka in-charge of handling matters pertaining to these areas, and thus shifting all action to the domestic realm.As called for by the Resolution, the High Commissioner will be presenting a comprehensive report on the implementation of the Resolution to the Council on 22 March 2017. This Report has been made available in advance to the public.
The Resolution that Sri Lankas Permanent Representative to the UN in Geneva, Ravinatha Aryasinha committed to co-sponsor at the current 34thSession of the Council, making a statement to this effect at the informal consultation held in Geneva on 7 March 2017, is one that provides for atwo-year extension of the timeline for fulfilment of commitments made in Resolution 30/1. While the views, observations and recommendations of the High Commissioner for Human Rights and the Special Procedures, as stated by Ambassador Aryasinha, are constructive and meaningful for Sri Lanka as we strive to strengthen, promote, and protect human rights, good governance, and the rule of law in Sri Lanka, the Resolution will not include taking on any new commitments arising from the High Commissioners Report to the Council at its current 34thSession. As stated by Ambassador Aryasinha, We arestudying all their reports carefully and we will, at a suitable time, share our views and observations on the issues raised in the High Commissioners latest Report, after consultation with all parties concerned, and also provide updates.
What the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs set out to explain and clarify isthatwhat Sri Lanka will undertake at the current34thsession,is atwo-year extension of the timeline forfulfilmentof commitments made in Resolution 30/1, andthat there will be no additional or new commitments arising fromthe High Commissioners Report to this current 34thSession.

Modis party wins
INDIA: Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modis Hindu nationalist party won a landslide victory in Indias most important battleground state Saturday, in a personal triumph viewed as a massive show of confidence halfway into his first term.
Modis Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a surprise absolute majority in Uttar Pradesh (UP), the countrys most populous state that is home to 220 million people and seen as a key indicator of national politics.
Party leader Amit Shah called the win a historic mandate for the BJP and said it would also form governments in the states of Uttarakhand, Goa and Manipur.
These results will set Indian politics in a new direction, he said at a press conference at the partys New Delhi headquarters ahead of a formal election commission announcement of the results due later Saturday.
The faith that people have placed in the BJP and in Narendra Modi will pay off. The party won over 300 of the total 403 seats in Uttar Pradesh, way above the figure it needs to form a government on its own. It also won a majority in Uttarakhand, but the election commission website showed the opposition Congress Party led in Goa and Manipur with just a handful of seats still to be counted. Shah said the result showed Modi, who personally led the campaign in the key battleground state of UP, was now the most popular leader since independence.
The BJP had been expected to perform well in UP, but few experts had predicted the scale of the victory in elections viewed as a test of Modis popularity after a controversial ban on high-value banknotes.
Experts said the results showed Modi had succeeded in tapping into popular anger over corruption with the move, which was aimed at tackling tax evasion but also led to widespread chaos in a country where most transactions are cash-based.
Modi called Indias massive demonetisation drive, which withdrew 86 percent of the countrys currency bills from the system, to cleanse the system of tax evasion and corruption. Banks and ATMs witnessed massive lines of people for months. ATMs were not refilled for days and banks ran out of cash within a few hours of opening. The government was able to tide over the problem as voting started last month.
People were more struck by the act itself than by its consequences, said Gilles Verniers, a UP expert at the Ashoka University, told AFP.
It was seen as a move that went beyond party and caste and affected everyone equally -- notably the rich. The results will also strengthen the BJPs hand in parliaments upper house, where the lack of a majority has hampered its reform agenda. In a tweet, Modi said he was overjoyed by the unprecedented support from all sections of society and congratulated party workers. - FRANCE 24, AFP and AP

New battle begins here
My visit to Puthukudiyiruppu today (March 11, 2017) as the UNHRC debates Sri Lanka was coincidental. The Election Commission had received from Australia packages of books, pencils, pens and miscellaneous items for indigent refugee children and I took a boxful to the survivors at Puthukudiyiruppu. Through Rev. Fr. Joseph H. Jeyaceelan of the Jaffna diocese I identified Kunakunthammah, meaning the Virtuous Mother, that is the Virgin Mary. Her son-in-law John Bosco and daughter Dijanawere running The John Education Center where about 250 children come after school for coaching in cadjanned classrooms. A good 30 of them were orphans with about 20 on scholarships and the remaining supported by their friends and relations.
What I found was a pious, apolitical family that has suffered immensely and yet remains cheerful, and grateful to God that they survived. The simple homely meal they served us was so tasty that I cannot forget it ever.
That they were apolitical is seen in Kunakunthammah Francis birth certificate name  Kunawardene, a name given to her by her father after his friend Kunawardene despite that being a male Sinhalese name. As trouble brewed, saying she needed a Tamil Catholic name, her name was changed to Kunakunthammah after Mary the Mother of Jesus.
It was a time when the army was raining shells on civilians and the desperate LTTE was keeping Tamils as hostages and forcing them to carry arms or serve in labour gangs. John Bosco therefore hid in the CARE office where he worked without going out for almost two years. The Tigers intensified their forced recruitment and press-ganging in Dec. 2007. However on November 9, 2008 as he recalls, the government asked all INGOs to leave and he lost his hiding place.
Army operations
As he tried to move across to the government side, he was press-ganged by the Tigers for their labour force. His mother Ritammah got a nervous breakdown over being unable to get John back and then a heart attack and passed away. While cycling back, an army shell blew out Johns entrails on 27.03.2009. He had the presence of mind to push them back in and tie them in with a sarong. Bicycling away he lost consciousness. When he awoke, he was in a pile of bodies with three on top of him, given up for dead. From there he saw a girl who studied with him and called out to her before fainting again. He was found when he moved, rescued and now survives after four surgeries.
During the army operations a shell fell on the shelter they had dug and six people died at once together on 09.02.2009  Johns father Mathias Alles who had had a heart attack after hearing that johns body had been taken away for disposal and died without knowing John was alive, Johns brothers father-in-law Victor Gnanapragasam, and four other relations.
Kunakunthammahs daughter Dimala was taken by the LTTE in 2008 while studying for the A/L exams. She was aged 22. She was allowed to visit home for her father Mathias Alles funeral. The family found she had been tortured and mentally disturbed. At the time they were in Matalan waiting to cross to the government side but the Tigers caught her and took her away but brought her back three days later saying she had pneumonia. On the way to the ship carrying refugees she died. She was buried by the family at the beach without the required Christian funeral rites.
Roman Catholic population
There had been only seven priests serving the large Roman Catholic population. Father Michael Joseph Francis, former Rector of St. Patricks College whom I knew, had led a band of sixty regional LTTE commanders to surrender during the last days. The army had asked him to help write down all their names for the army. At the end, he too was asked to join the 60 in a bus in which they were taken. He was never heard of again, nor the 60 who surrendered.
John, his wife and child were given passage out on an ICRC ship and sent to Vavuniya because of his injuries. Kunakunthammah without papers was moving from camp to camp. The others were locked up for a year by the government behind barbed wire fences and then released. They returned to find their houses fully flattened by bombs.
After seeing this experience, Kunakunthammah Francis lost her faith in God. She kept away from Church.
Then Father Jeyaceelan discovered her at the Chettikulam Ramanathan Camp and brought her back to God. Now she says nothing can keep her away from God and His Church.
Resolution at UNHRC in 2015
If the Government is truly ignorant of what our army did to Tamils, it merely needs to ask the SSO (I believe for Social Service Officer) under each Divisional Secretary. They know all the sordid details.
What happened is a crime against humanity. Kunakunthammah and family were noncombatant civilians. They were Sri Lankans to whom was owed the protection of the state.
Our government cosponsored a resolution at the UNHRC in 2015 promising war crime tribunals that stressed the importance of participation in a Sri Lankan judicial mechanism, including the special counsels office, of Commonwealth and other foreign judges, defence lawyers and authorized prosecutors and investigators.
After doing nothing for two years, the government is now cosponsoring a new resolution calling for an extension of two years to fully implement measures that are outstanding from the 2015 UN resolution. However, locally the President and PM have promised that foreign judges will never be allowed and the President has said that he has the backbone to reject hybrid courts to try war crimes.
Clearly, the governments intentions lack bona fides. The Government is prevaricating locally and abroad in committing to fully implement outstanding measures which include war crimes tribunals; while at the same time making the statement that that military commanders who led the successful campaign to crush separatist Tamil Tiger rebels in 2009 should not be humiliated by bringing them to court (EconomyNext,17.10.2016).
Kunakunthammah confessed privately to my wife that she is scared of another war, and her only prayer is that her remaining child, a son, and two grandchildren should not see the carnage she has seen and not suffer the loss of dear ones as she has. The government owes it to her and many other mothers like her whom I saw protesting against horrendous killings at the Killinichchi junction on my way back.

New maternity hospital for Karapitiya
The new maternity hospital at Karapitiya being constructed under a loan of Rs 18 billion and grant of Rs 500 million with German finance assistance, will be completed within two years. It will be one of the most modern maternity hospitals in Sri Lanka, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody told the Daily News.
The minister said the new maternity hospital is a prime need for the Southern Province because after the tsunami, the maternity hospital at Mahamodara, Galle, was badly damaged. It was later renovated for temporary use. The aim of the new hospital is to provide better healthcare for underprivileged patients. "The government wants to ensure that there wont be pregnant mothers sleeping on the corridors of hospitals, the minister said.
Health Ministry Deputy Project Director and Chief Civil Engineer Gayan Ranaweera said the new maternity hospital at Karapitiya, Galle, will consist of 600 beds for indoor patients along with clinical facilities to treat 200 outdoor patients daily.
In addition, it will also consist of an Intensive Care Unit, Premature Baby Care Unit, six Modular Theatres, Radiology Unit, Hematology Unit, Blood Bank, and Physiotherapy unit.
He said since Mahamodara Maternity Hospital is situated close to the sea, sensitive medical equipment such as scanners, X-ray machines, theatre apparatus, and the central AC become corroded due to the sea breeze.
The ministry had previously decided to relocate Mahamodara Maternity Hospital away from the sea belt to an interior location. However, this was not implemented due to the lack of funds. Now, it has been materialized, he said.

NIA asks Keralite to leave religious school in Sri Lanka
Alleged Islamic State (IS) recruiter from Kerala, Abdul Rashid Abdulla, accused of `instigating' 22 youths from Kerala to join the terror outfit, was sternly asked to leave a religious school in Sri Lanka on account of his radical views, according to a chargesheet filed by the National Investigation Agency (NIA).
According to the chargesheet against Abdulla and Islamic Research Foundation's guest relations manager Arshi Qureshi, Abdulla and 17 other Indians at the school in Sri Lanka were warned never to raise such issues again, and were categorically told, "Jihad is to fight with bad elements of your own self, Jihad does not mean fighting and killing innocent people."
Among those who attended the religious school, that had arranged for special classes on the Quran, there were 80 Sri Lankans and 18 Indians.The six-volume NIA chargesheet includes statements of 49 witnesses.
Among them are statements from three of the 22 youths who were allegedly instigated by Abdulla and Qureshi to join the fight in Syria. The names of witnesses have been redacted from the chargesheet by the NIA.
According to the charge sheet, Abdulla had decided to go to Sri Lanka along with some other Indians to gather more knowledge on the Quran before travelling to Syria to join the battle there.
A witness statement in the charge sheet reads, "Once he (name redacted) chatted about brother (name redacted). He told that (name redacted) was inclined towards Islamic State ideology and asked me to cross check it from (name redacted).
Therefore, I went to (name redacted) and asked him, on which, he replied that Islamic State is far better than other Islamic groups. I was not convinced and hence discussed this issue with (name redacted) and (name redacted). - DNA

ONUR promotes unity via Sahodara Pasal/Padasalai
The Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) joined hands with several provincial education departments and launched a training programme to strengthen reconciliation in schools across the island.
This was to encourage unity among schoolchildren, help them understand and respect diversity, and to bring diverse communities in Sri Lanka closer.
The first in this series of experiential programmes was held in Anuradhapura in 2016, and subsequently, three more were held in the Eastern, Central, Southern, Sabragamuwa, Western, and Northern Provinces.
The endeavour was followed by student exchange camps aptly called 'Sahodara Pasal/Padasalai,' which were held in Batticaloa, bringing together schools in the Eastern and Southern Provinces. Schools were paired to continue reconciliation activities in the provinces, and the programme concluded in Dambulla with the training extended for the diverse student population within the province.
The programme held between schools of the Western and Northern Provinces concluded in Jaffna in February, 2017, in which 112 students from 25 schools in the Northern Province and 88 students from 20 schools in the Western Province took part.
Hundreds of students representing diverse ethnic, religious, and linguistic backgrounds came together for a five-day residential camp where they learned to live together, had the opportunity to understand and appreciate diverse subjects related to reconciliation, engaged in activities, and formulated an action plan to follow up before heading to their respective communities to work towards reconciliation. During the programme, teachers from the respective schools participated in sessions on conflict transformation and understanding their role in the process of creating national unity and reconciliation.
The key objective of this programme aims to create a pool of facilitators among teachers and education officials in the provinces while connecting thousands of students to become change-makers in their communities.
This approach is ONUR's medium to long-term plan for the education sector to be implemented through national, provincial, and zonal levels, where these initiatives evolve into a long-term plan to foster relationships between the provinces and the wider student communities in a sustainable manner.

Women in Sri Lanka are fortunate as both, the President and Prime minister, have given women due recognition in society, said Womens and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara.
She said this while addressing the International Women's Day celebrations held in Matara, on March 8.
The 25% female representation at the forthcoming local government election was a big achievement. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has supported me in getting cabinet approval for proposals made by my ministry, she added.
She said, In the past, even the illiterate villagers treated females with respect and love as it was the female that sweated to cook and take care of her family. The role played by women have changed; women have been empowered with the strength to surpass male domination in many fields, including government. You should remember that it was Sri Lanka that elected the first Woman Prime Minister in the world.
This years theme for the International Womens day celebration in Sri Lanka is The one who sees the past, present, and future is victorious in her efforts," the Minister said.
Minister for Law and Order and Southern Development read the message sent by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while Provincial Minister Chandima Rasaputhra read the message sent by President Maithripala Sirisena.

Priority lane for buses operative from yesterday
The one-week pilot project on the priority lane for buses commenced yesterday morning from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction.
Under the pilot project, priority lanes for buses have been allocated from Rajagiriya to Ayurveda junction and from Ayurveda junction to Rajagiriya. The pilot project will continue until next Sunday (March 19) with the aim of finding a long lasting solution to the traffic congestion in Colombo. According to the Western Development and Megapolis Ministry, at least 150-180 buses are plying per hour from Battaramulla to Colombo Fort during the rush hours from 7am to 9am and 4.30pm to 7pm carrying about 8,000-10,000 passengers.
The project is aimed at easing the traffic congestion to allow these passengers to reach their destinations as soon as possible.
Feedback will be collected at the end of the seven days pilot project to know the shortcomings, practical problems, peoples reactions, and reactions of private and state sector bus drivers as well as private vehicle owners.
After addressing the problems identified during the pilot project, the priority lane will be implemented from Battaramulla to Fort (10kms). KOICA is giving consultancy and assistance to carry out the project, while Prof Amal Kumarage has been appointed as the Project Consultant.
The Western Development and Megapolis Ministry is implementing the project jointly with the Road Development Authority, Sri Lanka Transport Board, Sri Lanka Police, Moratuwa University, and Western Province Road Passenger Transport Authority and Colombo Municipal Council.
Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva and Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna also participated in the commencement of the pilot project. Meanwhile, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka addressing the media said that the pilot project would be implemented as a solution to the prevailing traffic congestion and to uplift the standards of public passenger transportation.
The project was implemented with the collaboration of Transport Ministry, Megapolis and Western Development Ministry and Road Development Authority (RDA), he added. Minister also requested the private vehicles to provide their support and to have patience for any inconvenience.
He further said that this would be the initial step to collect data in order to implement an express public bus service.

A provocative gold rush mystery from the other side of the world
The Luminaries is a story of drama and mystery of the best variety; it will delight both those brainier sorts with a very calculated attention to detail, but also dreamers of the astrological sort as long as youre willing to work through its more-than-800 pages.
Divided loyalties
Truth be told, I failed my own first attempt at reading it, but feel well-rewarded upon finishing!
If youre looking for a story of interlaced tales and controversies to make your brain spin, this one will have you singing through its pages. Published in 2013 by Canadian-born Eleanor Catton, who lives in New Zealand, The Luminaries thrives on the hope and greed of a frontier settlement and the divided loyalties of its residents.
Its 1865 in Hokitika, a town on the cusp of a booming gold rush on New Zealands South Island when Walter Moody, a young man seeking his own fortune, blows into town on a stormy eve and into a secret assembly of 12 men.
Old-world syntax
The mismatched congregation of characters are in the midst of disentangling the weighty mystery of a murder, an extraordinary amount of gold and a young prostitutes attempted suicide. Each man is embroiled in the puzzle of events and as they narrate their tales, an intricate picture spanning decades and continents starts to take shape.
Like the Klondike, the New Zealand Gold Rush spurred intense migration and a boom of industry on foreign territory. It was a volatile time of change, the twilight as Eleanor Catton labels it, between an old and new world and delicious backdrop for a tale of intrigue. Cattons use of old-world syntax successfully transports the reader to another time with opium, prostitutes, bad moonshine and gambling habits abound, while the variety in her tone, playing between matter-of-fact, politely distanced and pointedly whimsical, creates a tangible world of characters rich in both faults and virtues.
Fictional and historical, Catton nimbly braids an astrological component into the novel as well. This thread not only shows the work she laboured into the story, but adds a dreamlike quality to the more distinct mysteries already in contention. Intricately layered with opportunity, betrayal and scandal, The Luminaries is a book that warrants the thickness of its spine (and the Man Booker Prize it won in 2013) and I would recommend giving it a go; however, the one caveat is the takeaway message: there isnt really one.
Dont be deterred: the plot is deliciously satisfying, the skill in how it is unfurled absolutely supreme and the entertainment value very high, but, after reading, your world will likely remain unchanged. - its truly a fantastic one!

Put fallen leaves to work
As a founding employee of Gardener's Supply, I wore many different hats over the years. Currently, I have my own company called Johnnie Brook Creative. The gardens around my home in Richmond, VT, include a large vegetable garden, seasonal greenhouse, cutting garden, perennial gardens, rock garden, shade garden, berry plantings, lots of container plants and a meadow garden. There's no place I'd rather be than in the garden.
The longer I garden, the greater my appreciation for the value of organic matter. And one of the very best sources of organic matter is autumn leaves.
Leaves are packed with trace minerals that trees draw up from deep in the soil. When added to your garden, leaves feed earthworms and beneficial microbes. They lighten heavy soils and help sandy soils retain moisture. They make an attractive mulch in the flower garden. They're a fabulous source of carbon to balance the nitrogen in your compost pile. And they insulate tender plants from cold.
First, shred up as many of them as you can. I don't have a leaf shredder, though I'm considering purchasing one. Instead, I let the leaves pile up on the lawn and then drive over them a few times with the lawn mower. Shredding one leaf into five or ten smaller pieces does several good things. It increases the surface area, giving microbes many more places to work. It prevents the leaves from packing together into layers that won't let water or air penetrate. And it reduces the volume dramatically.
Once the leaves are shredded, I rake them up. Most of them go into plastic trash bags that get stashed in the barn for next spring when I'll use them as mulch in my perennial gardens. In time, shredded leaves become something called leaf mold, which makes a fabulous mulch. What's more, it does wonders for the soil, and I like the look of it.
As for the rest of the shredded leaves, some get put aside for a month or so to be used for mulching my garlic, tender perennials and roses. The rest get carted over to the vegetable and cutting gardens.
The beds in these two gardens are permanent, so it's easy to focus all my soil-building energy right in the growing zone. As the beds get cleaned out, I cover the soil with a layer of shredded leaves and fork that in a bit. On top goes some granular organic fertilizer and  if I have any  some compost. By spring it's all a crumbly mix that plants would be crazy not to love.
To mulch the asparagus bed, I first cut the fronds down to about 12 inches. The bed gets a good helping of granular fertilizer and is then covered with a 3-inch layer of shredded leaves.
Not all the leaves in my yard get shredded, though if I had the time I'd probably do so. By November, I've usually run out of steam and simply pack the rest of the whole leaves into my compost bin. I add these leaves to the working compost pile throughout the year to balance the food scraps and other materials that are usually high nitrogen. The leaves also keep the pile from getting compacted and soggy.
For me, keeping busy is the best way to fend off the blues, which is how I sometimes feel as winter approaches. Raking and hauling and digging and spreading keep me moving and my gardens just get better and easier to care for every year. - www.gardeners.com
Using Shredded Leaves
If you have an abundant source of leaves in the fall, shred them. Your garden will benefit in a big way. Here how to use them:
Insulate Tender Plants: A 6-inch blanket of leaves protects tender plants from winter wind and cold. Cover cold-hardy vegetablessuch as carrots, kale, leeks and beetsand you'll be able to harvest them all winter.
Boost Your Compost Pile: Carbon-rich leaves balance high-nitrogen compost ingredients such as fresh grass clippings.
Improve Your Soil: Mix shredded leaves right into your garden. Next spring, your soil will be teeming with earthworms and other beneficial organisms.
Make "Leaf Mold": Simply rake the leaves into a big pile. If you shred them, they will decompose faster, but you can still make leaf mold without shredding. After one to three years, fungus will have broken the leaves down to a special compost that smells like a walk through the woods. Leaf mold is high in calcium and magnesium and retains three to five times its weight in waterrivaling peat moss.
Think Before You Shred
Be careful with some kinds of leaves. Walnut, eucalyptus and camphor laurel leaves contain substances that inhibit plant growth. It's best to compost these leaves before using them in your garden
Be sure to chop or shred leaves before using them as mulch. Whole leaves can form a mat that water can't penetrate.
If you add shredded leaves right to the soil, add some slow-release nitrogen fertilizers to help the leaves decompose and to ensure that soil microbes don't use all of the available nitrogen.

Ratmalana to become third intl airport
Sri Lankan aviation history will be re written when the Ratmalana airport is converted to an international airport with flights to China via the Maldives.
An official from the Transport and Civil Aviation Ministry said the first flight to the Maldives airport will fly out from Ratmalana operated by maldivian Airlines. It will also offer connections to China, Dhaka, Bangkok and Chennai making Ratmalana the third Sri Lanka airport after Colombo and Mattala to offer connections.
maldivian Airlines will operate a 60 seater D8 aircraft for this operation. The Airport and Aviation Authority has also looked at the runway and other facilities and have approved the safety standards at the Ratmalana airport.
He said Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva was working to revive the Ratmalana airport and negations were going on with Maldivan government as well as the Air Force in this regard. He said Maldivian Civil Aviation Minister Moosa Sameer was also in Colombo last week and the final MOU in this regard will be inked next week.
We have now taken the entire control of the airport from the Air Force and it will a commercial airport now. He said the second terminal building that was idling is also being refurbished.
New Customs, Immigration counters, new fire engines, aviation fuel filling facilities, medical facilities, cafeterias and all other international facilities will be introduced within the next two weeks. We would also have facilities for six duty free shops and are keen to offer it to the private sector immediately.
The Minister is now negotiating with an Indian government airline and also a private operator to explore the possibility of launching Indian flights to new destinations from Ratmalana.
He said that Ratmalana will also be the only airport in Sri Lanka where a passenger will be able to get a connection to Jaffna via Heli Tours which operates from Ratmalana This will also entice private operators which already have hangars in Ratmalana to begin their operations with international flights coming in.
He said that it took less than Rs.10 million to convert Ratmalana from a domestic airport to an international one. The main aim was to promote tourism and charter flights too will be entertained at Ratmalana.

Sinclair Lewis, American Prophet
It Cant Happen Here, a 1935 novel about the rise of a fascist government in America has been garnering plenty of attention post-election, but even as it muscles its way onto bestseller lists and inspires think pieces in publications like the New York Times, the man behind the tale remains in the shadows. Sinclair Lewis was one of the most prolific and prominent American authors of the 1920s and 30s. He was the first American to win a Nobel Prize for Literature and turned down a Pulitzer in a fit of pique. It Cant Happen Here might be the novel in the limelight, but his one-two-three gut punch of Main Street, Babbitt and Elmer Gantry, all written between 1920 and 1927, are more relevant today than theyve ever been. The man himself deserves to have his reputation as one of Americas finest homegrown satirists restored.
Commercial success
Sinclair Lewis, born in Sauk Centre, MN in 1885, used to be somebody. In addition to the Nobel Prize for Literature and the Pulitzer he rejected in response to being denied it for an earlier work, he was a major commercial success during his lifetime. He sold the first magazine serial rights to his novel Arrowsmith (1925) for $50,000what his publisher deemed to be the highest price paid for such rights at the time.
Weaker novels
The initial print run of Elmer Gantry (1927) was 140,000 copies. It was the largest first printing of any book at the time. He earned half a million dollars in royalties, serialization fees and movie rights for Cass Timberlane (1945), one of his later and weaker novels. In 1939, Colophon magazine asked readers to name the living American authors they thought people would consider classics in the year 2000. Sinclair Lewis topped the list.
This prediction did not come to pass.
Lewis himself wasnt even dead a decade when Lewis biographer Mark Schorer declared him one of the worst writers in American literature. By 1987, Harold Bloom wrote, Lewis is of very nearly no interest whatsoever to American literary critics of my own generation and younger, so that it seems likely his decline in renown will continue, while noting that Lewis had already been surpassed in reputation and acclaim by William Faulkner, Ernest Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Willa Cather, and Theodore Dreiser. Even Lewiss own hometown, the aforementioned Sauk Centre, MN, has abandoned him. This past fall, the Sinclair Lewis Interpretative Center, devoted to showcasing the life of the towns most prominent native son, shut its doors for good. The land is being sold to a developer and is destined to become the site of a new chain store. You talk to kids in school now, and they either dont know or dont care who he is. And its not just the kids. I tried to read Main Street. I start it every winter. I still cant get through that book, Sarah Morton, Sauk Centres city planner told the Minneapolis Star-Tribune.
At first glance, the most common critiques leveled at Lewiss work are not without merit. His books are dense and sprawling. Theyre filled with clever but protracted monologues in the vernacular of the day. If you like Whit Stillman period-piece films built around pithy conversations meant to illuminate social classes or subcultures, youll love Sinclair Lewiss novels.
Most of them lack a coherent, forward-moving plot. Instead, there are loose vignettes or day-in-the-life recountings.
You could easily summarize Babbitt (1922) as insecure businessman feels as if there is something missing in his life, undertakes several minor intellectual and social rebellions to feel more alive, but is ultimately lead back to conformity by his lack of courage and fear of social and professional ostracism.
Morally bankrupt
Main Street (1920) would be ambitious young woman marries, moves to the Midwest, attempts to affect social change through sheer force of will, but ultimately learns to accept the strictures of geography and gender by which shes bound. Elmer Gantry is morally bankrupt sociopath uses religion to manipulate those around him and society at large for his own gain and glorification. - Lit Hub

SOC on National Security to address TNA concerns on Counter Terrorism Act
The Sectoral Oversight Committee on National Security has assured that certain concerns the TNA has with the Counter Terrorism Act will be fully addressed, TNA MP M.A. Sumanthiran said.
There were few concerns regarding the new Counter Terrorism Act, but we were assured that they have been corrected. Our concerns were to do with terms of detention, confessions used as evidence and on access to legal assistance from the time of arrest, MP Sumanthiran explained. However, there is still another important matter that remains which is to do with the definition of terrorism.
The original draft of the CTA has a definition that runs into some six pages. We suggested an alternative formulation based on certain drafts available in the international treaties. I hope that change will also be introduced, Sumanthiran said.
Meanwhile, speaking on the amendment to the Code of Criminal Procedure on granting legal assistance to suspects at the time of arrest, Sumanthiran said they are not satisfied with the amendment.
Earlier, the draft law of the amendment said that a suspect can have legal assistance just after the recording of the first statement.
The Oversight Committee protested against this draft law. Now a replacing amendment has been gazzetted which says a suspect can have access to a lawyer from the time of arrest unless it will interfere with the ongoing investigations, Sumanthiran said.
We will oppose this amendment as well. Who would have the authority to decide if or if not giving an opportunity to seek legal assistance may or may not interfere with the investigations Sumanthiran questioned. He said the new amendment is not in keeping with what was assured on the matter.
Legal assistance has to be given at the time of arrest without any qualifications. The police cannot decide whether providing legal assistance at the time of arrest, will or will not interfere with the ongoing investigations, Sumanthiran added.

Social inclusion vs exclusion
Sri Lanka being committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) by 2030 is now on a mission to strengthen democracy, fundamental rights, reconciliation and development for lasting peace, freedom and national integration.
Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake in his Budget Speech in 2017 said the government will set in programmes that will lay tremendous emphasis on social inclusion and sustainability in economic development and a commitment to achieve the UN SDGs by 2030 to ensure shelter, safe drinking water, and improved living standards for all.
Irakli Khodeli
The Programme Specialist at the UNESCO regional office in Jakarta, Irakli Khodeli, in an interview with the Daily News, on a recent visit to Sri Lanka said social inclusion was one of the most important goals included in the SDGs and added that strengthening social inclusion was vital for a country to ensure sustainable development, lasting peace, and reconciliation. Khodeli is also engaged in promoting social inclusion through public policies in the ASEAN region, in cooperation with the relevant stakeholders  National governments, civil society organisations, Universities, and Research Centres.
Excerpts of the Interview:
Q: What is the reason for your visit to Sri Lanka
A: For the first time in Sri Lanka, an Ethical Teachers training course was introduced to advance the quality of ethics education by building professional capacities of ethical teachers in the country and the wider South Asian region. This is for mostly at the university level.
It is based on the understanding of bio ethics and was mostly taught in the medical and law facilities as an additional course. But now it has suddenly become a requirement.
Q: What is ethics education
A: Ethics education is not something that you can teach like you teach biology or physics. It is complex and it has to make the students understand the value of ethics in complex situations. Many countries have shown interest in this including Sri Lanka. The professors or PhD students who intend to teach ethics are part of the course.
Q: You are also engaged in promoting social inclusion. What is it and how does it fit into the SDGs
A: Anything and everything under the sun seems to have been included in the goals. But if you were to find one important thing in it, that would be social inclusion.
There are 17 goals and goal 16 (promote peaceful and inclusive societies for sustainable development, provide access to justice for all and build effective, accountable and inclusive institutions at all levels), is specifically dedicated to social inclusion. But other SDGs are also indirectly related to it. Promoting equality within the country as well as between the countries is also taken into consideration.
The word inclusiveness is part and parcel of the 2030 agenda. It is important to note that this is in contrast to the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). Growth of a country was the highlight of those goals. The reason why inclusiveness is given the higher priority is that we have realised that the gap between the have and the have not has been increased and that keeps widening. A lot of people were pulled out of poverty
through MDGs but at the same time, the gap between the societies widened. Unequal societies lead to social pressures and stabilities.
The world has understood that you have to consider how the benefits of the economic growth should be distributed in society that nobody is left behind.
Q: Why is social inclusion so important
A: Social inclusion is also a matter of criticism. When talking about MDGs, it is easy to define. But it is not easy to measure social inclusion. Matters related to social inclusion deal with complexities and unpredictability.
At UNESCO, we are trying to bring in the knowledge related to social inclusion to the policymakers.
We are also working together with the policymakers to make them understand what is social inclusion and the good practices that can be implemented. Measuring is always done with statistics, data and evidence. We are making progress.
If you look at the 2030 agenda, one of the vital things highlighted is the social inclusion. It is important within as well as outside the country. This is contrast to the MDGs, which focused mostly on the growth of a country.
Unequal societies lead to violence and other chaos.
So, the world has realised that you have to consider the values of social inclusion. It is also vital for the sustainable growth of a country.
Q: It is important to deal with the policymakers in order to implement the initiatives. What are the challenges faced when dealing with the policymakers in general
A: There are two major challenges. First is the evidence. It is very hard to collect evidence to measure inclusion. It is much easier for the governments to act on certain political commitments. Evidence for social inclusion becomes difficult as it is hard to identify what is the type of evidence that we are looking for as it is fragmented often.
There is evidence but it is collected by different institutions, ministries and government agencies. When they collect evidence, the most vulnerable and disadvantage part of population didnt figure into this evidence. It is hard to detect, and that is the reason why it is very important to design data and evidence collection in a way that captures the needs of the most destitute as well.
Another challenge is how to procedurally engage all stakeholders in the programme. It is important to note that social inclusion is not only the aim but is it also a process. And it has been proven that if you dont follow the process you will not have a suitable end result.
You will not have a social inclusive policy in education, for an example, if you dont have a social inclusive policy formulating and designing it. If you dont ask the people who are affected by this policy, we are not going to know what their problem is. Cost of decision making increases with the number of people involved in it. Sometimes, the policies are not made in a very inclusive manner and it is driven by political considerations. It is a challenging when it comes to making policies that are optimally inclusive for all stakeholders. UNESCO is currently working with that.
Q: Generally, are governments supportive towards such initiatives
A: I think governments are increasingly conscious of the needs to promote social inclusion. It really goes to the foundation of the stability of the country to have a social inclusive society. I cannot name a country where the government is not aware that less social inclusion you have, the more unstable the government will be. Therefore, your own standing as the government will be affected. Even authoritarian governments seek to know what people think because if you avoid the population that is destitute and vulnerable, you will be facing unrest in the long run.
Governments do care about the SDGs and many have taken initiatives to internalise them. And governments feel ownership of this. They are also trying to align their development plans to the SDGs. One cannot be true to the SDGs if he is not true to social inclusion.
Q: What is your opinion on the development of sustainable science and livelihoods with global changes in climate
A: I would like to answer that question in the perspective of social and human sciences. Sustainability science is a inter disciplinary emerging field that helps to focus on social and environmental problems of future generations while addressing social problems like poverty, making sure that we dont deplete the large support systems for tomorrow.
Sustainability science is about brining science for the benefit of people. It is like putting human face to science. In this design, you also have to include the local government, as at the end, it will be the governments responsibility to enact the decisions. You have to include universities, research centres and knowledge producers where they can share vital information. Also it should involve private sector as they are also part of the problem.
This inclusive approach is to identify the problem and solve it. It is also important to consider the role of values and ethics. Now we are turning towards science to deal with the serious problems we are facing in terms of climate change and other environmental problems. We need science to address the problems we have created.
Q: When talking about social inclusion, do you think social exclusion is also rapidly increasing among the people
A: Social inclusion and exclusion go hand in hand with each other. It is the vulnerable population that have been socially excluded.
Q: Language is one of the vital aspects of social inclusion. Sri Lanka also faced a 30-year-long war. Currently in the phase of reconciliation, one of the major gaps that still need to be filled is the language. How important is language for social inclusion
A: Language relates to social inclusion and cultural diversity. We have 6,000 languages in the world and that shows the tremendous cultural diversity among human beings. People should embrace the difference. Diversity can be a big strength of a society. Many countries have more than one official language other than citizens of that country speak. It is possible to have strong multi-lingual societies.

Speaker defeats party leader tactic against Democracy
A strategic move to create many obstacles to the smooth functioning of Parliament, and thereby the work of government, was prevented by Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas ruling this week that Wimal Weerawansa, elected to the House on the UPFA ticket in the August 2015 general election, would remain an independent member of the House, and not a party leader, following his moving away from the UPFA.
The rowdy and boisterous protest in the House by Joint Opposition members after this ruling, when there were ugly personal insults hurled at the Speaker by Weerawansa, and saw the suspension of Dinesh Gunawardena from the House for one week for unparliamentary speech and behaviour, showed the extent of the defeat the JO, which is the Mahinda Rajapaksa team in the House, faced through this ruling, which strengthened the democratic process.
It was much more than rowdy behaviour of the JO that posed a challenge to the Parliamentary process through this party leader tactic used by Weerawansa. In fact Mahinda Rajapaksa said Wimal Weerawansas move was the part of a strategic plan that could not be revealed. It was a plan that would have had major repercussion on the business of the House, and the tasks of government, had the Speaker ruled that Weerawansa would be a party leader. This move came at a time when the UPFA is nearing the end of its practical term in the House, with the divisions within the SLFP deepening, and moves afoot for the SLFPers who are with MR to join the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP). The SLFPs Kumara Welgama MP has already got endorsement from his voters to join the SLPP.
The acceptance of Wimal Weerawansa leading his five member team of the National Freedom Front (NFF) as a party leader would have opened the way for a barrage of new party leaders in the House. These would have been Vasudeva Nanayakkara  single member party leader of the Democratic Left Front, and the similar single member Udaya Gammanpila of the Pivithuru Hela Urumaya, and Dinesh Gunawardena who has a few more members in the Mahajana Eksath Peramuna; and others who may have won on the betel leaf ticket of the UPFA, to claim party leader status in Parliament. The problem this would cause for the functioning of Parliament would be their having the right to raise questions on matters of public importance under Standing Order23 (2) - which is the right of the Leader of the Opposition and leaders of recognized political parties in parliament. It is not difficult to see how much this would delay the proceedings of the House. They can also demand to attend the party leaders meetings that decide on the Business of the House, and also call for additional air time to be allocated in debates, as party leaders.
If this strategy worked, it would not be far off when all the SLFPers in the JO join the SLPP and these other party leaders, despite their complete lack of a voter base, would all be holding up the business of the House, as the SLPP has no party leader in Parliament. It was certainly a major strategy to delay and obstruct the working of Parliament and thereby he tasks of government, bringing about major obstacles to any legislative plan the government may have, or seeks to carry out in the future, unlike in the past two years.
Although Wimal Weerawansa celebrated his birthday in Parliament before the Speaker gave his ruling, he certainly did not get the birthday gift of party leadership. In fact, there was a major flaw in Weerawansas attempt to be a party leader, because although he was given the betel leaf symbol to contest the election under the UPFA, his party  the NFF  was not a member of the UPFA. The betel leaf symbol was a Rajapaksa giveaway to an ever faithful follower, which ensured that Weerawansa and the NFF got the SLFP votes, giving it five seats, doing much better than many SLFP members themselves.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has certainly given an important ruling that will be taken note of in future attempts to seek such status by those keener on disrupting and manipulating the proceedings in the House to suit their political games from time to time, than in supporting democracy through good parliamentary procedure.
Geneva fallout
The Government is facing the fallout from its sharp change of position on the Geneva resolution of the UN Human Rights Commission, particularly on the matter of hybrid courts - the decision not to have any foreign judges on probes into alleged war crimes. Both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe are clear in their position against foreign judges; the President on a principled opposition, and the Prime Minister on a practical opposition.
The new position, different to what the Sri Lankan delegation stated in Geneva two weeks earlier, will certainly helps the government in politics at home. But, it will have to do much more work on the many other issues of reconciliation and peace building that was part of the original Geneva Resolution in 2015, to present a credible image abroad of the governments commitment to the wider goals of the resolution.
The government will need to show much more commitment to issues such as the setting up of a Truth and Reconciliation Commission and quicker and firmer action on the matter of Missing Persons, as well as, look again into the areas that remain to be implemented from the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC) Report, which was Sri Lankas own initiative, to show those who are seeking better peace and reconciliation at home, and those keeping a watch from abroad, that this major goal of the government is not forgotten amidst the issues of domestic politics.
Sri Lanka has every hope of getting the additional two year period to implement what is stated in the 2015 UNHRC resolution, despite criticisms coming from abroad and some Sri Lankan voices here. But it will be necessary to achieve success on a wider area of activity, than has been seen since September 2015, and not let peace and reconciliation be an issue that will be canvassed in the next general election.
It will also have to seek better understanding with the TNA, and reach out to the minorities, while taking all action to assure the Sinhala majority of not having any cause for fears through the Constitutional changes and other measures that will be needed for better reconciliation.
Tamil Nadu politics
The death of a South Indian fisherman in the Palk Bay earlier this week, allegedly shot by the Sri Lanka Navy, has led to a rise in anti-Sri Lankan protests in Tamil Nadu. The Sri Lankan Navy has clearly said it did not carry out any such shooting. The Tamil Nadu Chief Minister K. Palaniswami, has asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to summon the Sri Lankan High Commissioner and convey the feelings of both the Central and State governments against the incident. The Indian Vice President Hamid Ansari has raised this issue with Sri Lankas President Maithripala Sirisena, when they met on the sidelines of the Indian Ocean Rim Association Summit, at Jakarta, Indonesia. The Sri Lanka President had said, he had spoken to the Chief of the Sri Lankan Navy who had said that no such incident from the side of the Sri Lankan forces took place.
The death of the fisherman, whatever the cause, has come as a ready tool for the Tamil extremist groups in Tamil Nadu, and the new Tamil Nadu leadership after the death of Jayalalithaa. The BJPs leading Tamil member Subramaniam Swamy has raised the wider issue of cross border fishing in Sri Lankan waters by Tamil Nadu fishermen, because export quality fish is almost exhausted in the Indian side of the ocean. He suggests Indian fisherman be allowed fish in Sri Lankan waters, for which Sri Lanka will be compensated by the Indian Government. The issue of Indian fishermen fishing in Sri Lankan waters needs the best negotiation and a solution, giving priority to losses suffered by the Sri Lankan fisherman, mainly Tamils from the North. The Tamil Nadu forces have no interest whatever in the rights and plight of the Sri Lankan Tamil fishermen, although loud about the rights of Tamils.
New Delhi taking a more cautious attitude on this issue is most welcome. There is the welcome news that Sri Lanka and India have agreed to the release of 19 Sri Lankan fishermen held by India and 85 Indian fishermen held by Sri Lanka. The Sri Lanka Navy is carrying out all security and facilitation work for the feast of St. Anthony at the Sri Lankan island of Kachchatheevu, drawing pilgrims from both countries, this weekend. Although some voices in Tamil Nadu call for a boycott of the feast, the indications are it will be a success, recognizing the contribution of the Sri Lanka Navy to it.

Sri Lanka eager to work with Indian Ocean maritime powers'
Sri Lanka is eager to work with the maritime powers of the Indian Ocean and beyond, to make our oceans secure for unimpeded commerce and peaceful navigation, Sri Lankan Ambassador in the USA Prasad Kariyawasam said, on Saturday. The Ambassador was addressing a public event hosted by the Hudson Institute, a Washington-based think tank, on Sri Lanka, A growing hub in the Indo-Pacific.
Ambassador Husain Haqqani, Senior Fellow & Director, South and Central Asia, Hudson Institute moderated the event. He introduced Sri Lanka as a fast emerging economic and political powerhouse, disproportionate to its size both in geographic terms and in population. He observed that Sri Lankas geo-strategic location has helped it emerge as a critical stakeholder in the Indo-Pacific region.
Echoing Ambassador Haqqanis observation, Ambassador Kariyawasam said that Sri Lankas location made it a maritime hub since ancient times, and having achieved peace and stability, Sri Lanka was keen and able to reassume this important role in the Indian Ocean and the extended terrain of the Indo-Pacific. Sri Lanka is situated in the sea lanes connected with the other main growth engines in the Indo-Pacific.
This busy East-West shipping route passes just six nautical miles south of Sri Lanka, carrying two-thirds of global petroleum supplies and half of all containerized cargo. The Colombo Port is already the busiest transshipment port in South Asia. In the current international environment where many locations are becoming insecure and volatile or face environmental challenges, Sri Lanka, in comparison, is a country at peace, has consolidated democracy, and revived economic growth, with emphasis on a green and a blue economy.

Sri Lanka Ports Authority records Rs 11 bn profit
Sri Lanka Ports Authority has earned a profit of Rs 11 billion in 2016 showing an 83 percent increase in relation to the previous year.
Minister of Ports and Shipping Arjuna Ranathunga declared these financial records officially while addressing a media conference held in the auditorium of the Ministry of Ports and Shipping recently.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority had to face many challenges to accomplish these substantial achievements, Minister Arjuna Ranathunga emphasized.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority had earned an income of Rs 44 billion in the previous year. After the deduction of operational expenditure, expenditure on administration, expenditure on loan interests and other expenditure from the total income Sri Lanka Ports Authority had earned a profit of Rs. 11 billion over the previous year.
Thereby profit has increased by Rs. 5 billion in comparision to 2015. It means Sri Lanka Ports Authority had earned a profit of Rs 6 billion in 2015. Thereby Sri Lanka Ports Authority has increased its income by 83 percent in one years time.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority had to face many challenges to achieve this victories position. In early 2015 we increased the salary of the employees by 15 percent and we paid a bonus of Rs 9,000 . Overtime payments also increased due to the increment in the salary.
In addition we have enhanced welfare facilities. We had to compete with Singapore, India, Bangladesh and Malaysia over the last period. We paid Rs 7,100 million as the total debt and the interest on the Hambantota Port in 2016. The total amount of debt and the interest paid by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was Rs. 16,700 million in that year. Even though conditions are difficult, we earned an Rs. 11 billion profit in 2016. Commitment of the employees, successful management has paved the way to these achievements.
Deductions of the unwanted expenditure, reduction in the corruptions are some other leading factors which led to these positive results of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. As an example operational expenditure of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority was Rs 22.6 billion in 2015. In 2016 we were able to reduce that amount to Rs 20.2 billion showing a reduction of Rs 2.4 billion, he said.

Sri Lanka released 77 of 85 Indian fishermen arrested last week after an alleged firing incident that resulted in the death of an Indian fisherman. The released fishermen are presently in Jaffna and would soon be repatriated. Seized fishing boats, however, remain with Sri Lanka.
Seventy-seven out of 85 Indian fishermen have been released by Sri Lanka government. They are put up in Jaffna and await repatriation. Release of remaining fishermen is expected soon, Gopal Baglay from the Ministry of External Affairs (MEA) said.
The MEA was in negotiation with Sri Lanka to get the fishermen released. India also has 19 Sri Lankan fishermen in its custody.
The Indian Government had expressed deep concerns at the shooting of Indian fisherman allegedly by the Sri Lankan Navy, an accusation denied by Sri Lanka that contended that the Sri Lankan Navy is not mandated to fire upon fishermen.
The 22-year-old fisherman from Tamil Nadu was allegedly shot dead a little short from Katchatheevu Island that was ceded by India to the Island nation in 1974 in a bilateral pact.Fishing is the economic mainstay of northern Sri Lanka and the fishermen have been demanding their Indian counterparts to stop bottom-trawling that they contend has been damaging the marine ecosystem.Since 2014, the Sri Lankan Navy seized more than 100 fishing trawlers; while they have released the Indian fishermen, they refuse to release the trawlers. - The New Indian Express
