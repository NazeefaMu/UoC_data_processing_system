President commissions Moragahakanda,  bringing to a close  the Mahaweli chapter
Fulfilling a long felt need of the people in the dry-zone, the giant Moragahakanda Reservoir, a multipurpose development project under the Moragahakanda - Kaluganga Reservoir Development Project was commissioned under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday, amidst the blessings and the chanting of Seth Pirith of the Maha Sangha.
With the commissioning of the project the waters of the Moragahakanda reservoir will nourish and make fertile thousands of hectares of barren lands and bring them under the plough while providing drinking water to quench the thirst of millions of people, who are affected with the scarcity of pure drinking water facilities for decades.
Sri Lanka, considered primarily as an agricultural nation, marked a significant milestone yesterday when the waters of the last but the biggest reservoir of the multipurpose Mahaweli Scheme at Moragahakanda had its sluice gates opened to irrigate parched dry lands in faraway Vanni in the Northern Province on the one side and Rajarata, Wayamba, Central and Eastern Provinces on the other.
The commencement of filling water to the Moragahakanda reservoir started on January 11 last year by President Sirisena giving a pledge that the project would be commissioned by the following January.
With the commissioning of the Moragahakanda reservoir, an additional 64,000,000 cubic metres of water will flow from the reservoir to far flung regions. The Moragahakanda project completed at Rs 180,000 million will end the water scarcity in several districts mainly in Matale, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura, Trincomalee and the Vanni. Besides, the water will add 25 MW to the national grid through four turbines installed in the main dam of the reservoir.
The Moragahakanda Dam is a high-gravity dam with a height of 65 metres. The dam has created the Moragahakanda Reservoir, which has an active storage capacity of 521,000,000 cubic meters, and is four times bigger than the gigantic Parakrama Samudraya in Polonnaruwa.
Two additional embankment saddle dams have been built to contain the Moragahakanda Reservoir. The Kalu Ganga Reservoir project, which has completed 70 percent construction, will link the Moragahakanda Reservoir via a tunnel.
Water from both, the Moragahakanda and Kalu Ganga Reservoirs, will be primarily used to support agricultural needs in an area of at least 81,422 hectares. This would increase rice production by 81 per cent or in other words it would increase the paddy production by 109,000 tons annually, amounting to an estimated monetary benefit of US$1.67 million, per year.
The project consists of two irrigation channel systems as the Rajarata channel system and the Wayamba Channel system. The Rajarata channel system is 102 km long and connects the Mahakanadarawa Tank via Huruluwewa.
The 96 km long Wayamba Channel system completed at a cost of US$ 200 million provides water to Wayamba, Both channel systems will supply water to 1,500 small tanks in the dry zone.
The two channel systems will help cultivate around 94,000 hectares of paddy land throughout the year allowing paddy farmers to cultivate both, the Yala and Maha seasons.
It is significant that yesterday also marked the 42nd anniversary of the commissioning of the first Mahaweli Project at Polgolla in the Central Province by the then Prime Minister Late Sirimavo Bandaranaike, on January 8, 1976.
The Moragahakanda project is the last of the Mahaweli scheme, which is truly the biggest multipurpose national project in the country. Although the bulk of the work was done during the UNP regime under the accelerated Mahaweli scheme, the last phase, that of Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga project, was considerably delayed due to various reasons, until President Sirisena took measures to expedite work on the project.
Owing to his untiring efforts, finally the President was able to take effective steps to accelerate the project when he won the Presidential Election exactly three years ago and assumed duties as the Executive President.

C. Logeswaran, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, Ministers, Parliamentarians and distinguished guests also participated.Pictures by Sudath Silva
President Maithripala Sirisena after opening the Rajagiriya Flyover yesterday told the relevant authorities to name the flyover after the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who was in the forefront in efforts to usher in a democratic government on January 8, 2015.
The ceremony to open the Rajagiriya Flyover, constructed with the aim of providing long term solutions to the heavy traffic congestion in the area and Colombo city was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe last morning.
The President said that the late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera was in the forefront of the peaceful peoples revolution which ushered the unity government on January 8.
President Sirisena said the Ven. Thera had been able to unite various political groups, trade unions, rights groups, artistes, professionals and academia to usher the January 8 revolution.
The President said, it was highly appropriate to name the flyover after Ven. Sobhitha Thera as an appreciation of the services rendered by the late Thera to the nation.
He also asked Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka to take necessary measures in this regard.
The President further said that January 8 is an important day in the countrys political history. Late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike who led the social revolution of 1956 was born on January 8.
During past three years we were able to overcome the countrys biggest challenges in making the country move forward. We were able to maintain healthy relations with all the countries, Pesident Sirisena said.Another massive peaceful revolution that took place on January 8, 2015 was born out of the need to rid the country of rulers who undermined democracy, freedom, social rights, human rights, fundamental rights and media freedom. On that day people of this country elected me as the President habouring various expectations, the President said.
As a result of winning international recognition, we were able to solve the long drawn out issues confronting the country. The present government was formed at a time of a hostile international reception towards Sri Lanka, threats, intimidation and the country being given the cold shoulder internally.
But today, the majority of countries have pledged to extend their assistance for the development of the country.
The flyover which has been constructed with financial assistance of the Government of Spain will be a long term solution for the heavy traffic congestion in the area that also caused environment pollution and economic losses.

President proposes to name Moragahakanda after Kulasinghe

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday proposed that the final reservoir of the Mahaweli Development Programme, Moragahakanda, be named after the late engineer, A.N.S. Kulasinghe.
Kulasinghe. who was closely involved with the Mahaweli Development Programme, was the Chairman and Founder of the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) and Founder Chairman of the Central Engineering Consultancy Bureau (CECB).
Many suggested that I name Morgahakanda, that I name it after myself, but I rejected them all, President Sirisena said addressing a gathering at a ceremony held to commemorate 42 years since the opening of the Polgolla Diversion project - the beginning of the Mahaweli Development Programme.
The President recalled the service rendered to him and the nation by Eng. Kulasinghe. In 1994 when I was the Deputy Minister of Irrigation, he guided me, took me to the jungles at Moragahakanda and advised me on how it needs to be built.
Kulasinghe, who was also acclaimed internationally, was a great human being. This will not only honour him but also all engineers who have worked for this country and the Mahaweli, he said.
The ceremony which also marked the end of the Mahaweli Development programme with the opening of Moragahakanda, the final of the five great reservoirs of the programme, had the Presidents reminisce about his arduous journey.
The Mahaweli Development programme was first discussed by politicians and experts in the 1930s. S.A. Wickremesinghe speaking in the senate had spoken of diverting the Mahaweli to the North. As a result of that, initial feasibility studies were undertaken, including that of Moragahahakanda, he said.
President Sirisena recalled that he came by bus and stood by the dams embankments to watch the ceremony that followed when the Polgolla Dam was declared open by then Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike in 1976.
From that day to the date, the biggest multi-purpose project undertaken was the Mahaweli Programme under J. R. Jayewardene and Gamini Dissanayake. During Bandaranaikes era, in the 60s and 70s, Soviet engineers, had drawn up a 30 year plan to complete the Mahaweli, but the 1977 government focused on industry and energy and they initiated the accelerated programme, the President said.
Whilst the magnetic personality of Dissanayake ensured that the dams of Kotmale, Victoria, Maduru Oya, Rantambe and Randenigala were completed, Moragahakanda was not taken up due to its low power generating capacity, the President said.
Since then, every politician to the North and North Central Province has taken up Morgahakanda in his/her political platform. 1994, when Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was contesting the presidential election, she asked me what is the main subject here. I told her, say you will start Morgahaakanda, but even during her time, it was not realised, he said.
Three feasibility studies were undertaken on Moragahakanda; one by Maithripala Senanayake in the 1970s, Gamini Dissanayake in the 1980s, and by President Sirisena as Mahaweli Minister in the 90s.
In 2007, the foundation stone for Moragahakanda was laid, I told then President Mahinda Rajapaksa the story of Moragahakanda, the plight of the farmers and people who suffered without water. We laid the foundation without a penny to build it, President Sirisena said.
He said the JAICA had initially agreed to fund it, but they rejected it later. When the Chinese came forward to fund it, it was rejected by the previous government, he said.
For 16 years as a minister I had worked with engineers but then they shifted me and asked me to work with doctors, he said.
This is the problem in our political culture and what is wrong with it, the President said, It took five years for the people to get water, he said.
Thus far, Rs. 230 million was spent on the Moragahakanda-Kalu Ganga scheme, Wayamba Ela project, Upper Elahera Canal Project and the Minipe diversion, President said. He believed that the projects would lay a strong foundation to improve the agricultural and fisheries economies of the country as well as supply clean drinking water to people suffering from kidney disease in the Rajarata.
The President, who placed special emphasis on the need to conserve the environment in the face of climate change, made conservation an intrinsic part of the Mahaweli.
As we open Moragahakanda, we would like to thank the engineers, every worker and politician from the 1930s who has sacrificed his knowledge, sweat and blood to make the Mahaweli a reality, concluded the President, celebrating his third year in office and the completion of his crowning achievement - Morgahakanda.
National Government completes Mahaweli programme: PM
When the Mahaweli started, political bickering was the norm, but today we have come together as a national government to complete it, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said as the government commemorated 42 years since the initiation of the Mahaweli Development Programme.
Addressing a ceremony held on the bridge of the Polgolla Dam, the first project of the Mahaweli, the Prime Minister thanked President Maithripala Sirisena for his efforts in making Moragahakanda a reality.
Today, the last of the Mahaweli, Moragahakanda was bestowed with the people and the Mahaweli was completed thanks to President Sirisena, the Prime Minister said.
Though it was built in 2-3 years, it took 5-6 years to fight for it. If he had given up, we would not have Moragahakanda with us today. But because of that reservoir, the Wayamba, Rajarata and from there the North will receive water, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, who also made special mention of the late Prime Minister Dudley Senanayake, Keerthi de Silva and the late Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who eventually declared open Polgolla, thanked the past leaders for their efforts in initiating the project.
Forty years ago, I went with Gamini Dissanayake to Ulhitiya, the first dam. The next day, J R Jayewardene came and laid the foundation stone for it. Before I become President, I wanted Mahaweli started. Thanks to Gamini, Kotmale, Victoria, Ulhitiya, Rathkinda, Randenigala, and Rantambe were built, he recalled.
Economic factors postponed Moragahakanda and later because of the war.
The Prime Minister called for a new water culture within the Mahaweli system and agricultural practices which take into account the unexpected challenges of climate change.
The Mahaweli made us self-sufficient in rice through the collection of water, but today we have new problems. If we dont have water, we cant fill these reservoirs. So we have to focus on changing our agriculture and water management practices, he said.
Moragahakanda was expected to strengthen the rural economy in the Rajarata. The government would also take measures through industries and tourism to strengthen the livelihood of those not engaged in agriculture, Prime Minister said. The Prime Minister promised to introduce modern technology to increase agricultural productivity to ensure self-sufficiency locally and for export. In future we hope for a better economy and a climate that would be kinder to us, the Prime Minister said.

Ravi files RTI application  seeking copy of Bond issue
Former Minister Ravi Karunanayake yesterday filed an RTI application at the Presidential Secretariat to get a copy of the report of Presidential Commission of Inquiry on the Bond issue.
The former minister, speaking to the media outside the Secretariat, insisted on fast-paced investigations on the MiG aircraft deal, hedging deal, Greek Bond issue and loss of SriLankan Airlines. He said some were trying to bring disrepute to him, the UNP, and the party leadership using the Bond issue.
The UNP is targeted in an unfair manner during an election period. I have been engaged in politics for 25 years. We do politics with the people and our hands are clean. You may assassinate me, but please do not assassinate my character, Karunanayake said refuting allegations made against him on the Bond issue and allegedly giving false evidence.
He also reiterated that the Central Bank and Commercial Banks were not under him at the time the Bond transaction happened.
It is our Government that made the Right to Information Act a reality and introduced a new political culture. I have sought a copy of the report under the RTI Act as some elements and the media have leveled allegations against me quoting the Bond Commission report. I will aptly reply after reading the report, Karunanayake added.
The Bond Commission report was handed over to the President on December 30.

Root's Ashes tour struggles last to bitter end
SYDNEY: Joe Root ended his troubled Ashes tour of Australia sound asleep as England surrendered to a 4-0 series loss in Sydney on Monday.
The young England captain finished the demanding five-Test series debilitated by a stomach bug which flared overnight and sent him to hospital.
Root could not resume batting at the start of the final day, but came to the crease an hour in when Moeen Ali was dismissed and batted to lunch.
He could not continue after the break as England slumped to a crushing innings defeat and missed the post-match presentations, with vice-captain James Anderson speaking on his behalf.
He was up all night with some sort of stomach bug, some gastro thing. He is asleep in the dressing-room trying to recover, Anderson told reporters.
He's not had any sleep, he's not eaten. He's had diarrhoea and vomiting, so I'm guessing he's not in a great state at the minute, the paceman added.
So to get to the ground in itself is a great effort and then to strap his pads on and bat for as long as he did was a brilliant effort from him and just shows what sort of character he is. Veteran Anderson praised Root's leadership on a troubled tour plagued by off-field distractions and the unavailability of suspended star allrounder Ben Stokes. He wants to lead by example for this team. He's been a fantastic captain throughout this tour, Anderson said. You ask any captain that has toured Australia it is not an easy place to come, not an easy place to play, especially when you're on the wrong end of results. Root finished retired ill on 58 for his fifth half-century of the series, but crucially he was not able to convert any into a Test ton.
He finished the series with 378 runs in nine innings at 47.25, the highest average of his team.
Australian captain Steve Smith praised Root's efforts to try and save the Test for England on a testing final day.
It took a lot of courage to come out and bat, you could see he was struggling a fair bit, particularly when he was running between wickets, Smith said.
He's a tough character so he must have been in a pretty bad way not to come out after the break.

The Supreme Court has ruled that the interview panel of Royal College should have been mindful of the fact that it is the ambition of every parent to admit their child to a school of their choice.
They should have looked at the documents not in a stereo typed manner but in a reasonable manner of every child who come before them seeking admission to the school . The Supreme Court made this direction to the Royal College principal and 12 other respondents who had violated the Fundamental Rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the constitution to Rohan Rahul Ayushaman of Bambalapitiya by refusing admission to grade one at Royal College Colombo 7.
The Supreme Court ordered the respondents to take steps to admit Rohana Rahul to Grade One or to the appropriate grade at Royal College, Colombo 7 from now on.
The Supreme Court three-judge-Bench comprising Justice Eva Wanasundara, Justice Nalin Perera and Vijith Malalgoda observed that the interview panel had failed to evaluate the documents submitted on behalf of the second petitioner and to allocate marks to him.
The Supreme Court maintained the panel had acted arbitrarily by deciding not to grant marks by considering the concept of residence in a very abstract manner.
They had failed to consider the documents submitted on behalf of the petitioner when the documents clearly establish the residence of the petitioner.
Senior Counsel Ian Fernando with Counsel Sumudu Ratnayake and Natasha Samarasinghe under the instructions of Pradeepa Siriwardena appeared for the petitioners.

Seeing the wood for the trees
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his band of pohottuwites are urging the public to consider the upcoming LG election as a referendum against, among other things, the Yahapalanaya government's move to divide the country. No longer are the derelict roads, unattended garbage piles, and general decay and disorganised state in the towns and villages attributed to the delay in holding LG elections, by the Joint Opposition stalwarts. Nor has the denial of the democratic right of the people due to the non holding of elections for over two years important any longer. All this has taken a back seat in the campaign of the pohottuwites who are urging the public to treat the upcoming elections as a referendum to protest the government's move to bring in a new constitution to divide the country. The single most important issue now is to save the country from being divided, and, for this, the JO is asking the public to register a protest vote against government candidates at the LG poll.
This was re-iterated at the maiden rally of the pohottuwites at Kadawatha on Saturday. Addressing the rally, Mahinda Rajapaksa urged the crowds to treat the poll as a referendum to show their anger against the government which is set to bring in a new constitution to grant Eelam and is selling national assets. True to form the pohottuwatites, as is its wont, sought to impress the TV audiences with the large crowds which has now became a pattern at rallies addressed by the former President. It will be a familiar sight in the coming days where the TV channels faithful to Rajapaksa will dutifully focus on the crowds at Mahinda rallies - notwithstanding that these are the same crowds that are being transported to all the JO rallies addressed by Rajapaksa through the incentive of buth packets, money and hooch as was evident the other day where some of the attendees were hugging terra firma sprawled in different poses and in different states of inebriation, as was captured on TV.
The pohottuwites who are trying to put up crowd shows to influence the voters fail to realize that this was the same scenario at the last Presidential Election as well. Massive crowds were bussed into all meeting venues and the bills of the SLCTB in this connection have not been settled to this day. Unprecedented crowds swarmed Polonnaruwa, the home turf of the Common Candidate, at the main rally addressed by Rajapaksa wherein the latter proclaimed from the stage that it was the biggest crowd ever to have gathered at the historic Polonnaruwa. Rajapaksa lost the seat by a majority of 30,000 votes. So much for crowd attendance at political rallies. Even in 1977 Sirima Bandaranaike drew the largest crowds but conceded a five sixth majority to JRJ.
Be that as it may, Rajapaksa may exude a unique charisma to draw in massive crowds to see him speak at rallies. But he will hardly be the focus at the LG poll where the voters will vote for individual candidates based on their popularity in the area. That is why all the parties in the fray have gone to great lengths to present popular figures as candidates at this election, as with all other LG elections in the past. In such a scenario Mahinda Rajapaksa will be the furthest from the minds of the voter who will be drawn to elect their apey miniha or gamey miniha. Local Government elections are also usually fought on local issues where larger national issues hardly have an impact on the villager, whatever Mahinda Rajapaksa and his cohorts urge the voters to do. There are also instances where voters don't vote on party lines at these elections but cast their ballot for individuals based on their popularity. Threats of a division of the country will be furthest from the minds of the village voter at this election.
Besides, we have travelled that path before. The Eelam bogey was drummed up loud at the last Presidential Election too by Mahinda Rajapaksa and Co. Popular actress turned politician and Rajapaksa camp follower Malini Fonseka, who campaigned assiduously for the re-election of MR, brought with her a Sri Lanka map to media briefings, which showed the North and East marked in the Eelam colours and warned the public of an imminent division of the country should Rajapaksa lose the poll. This did not work at the Presidential Election and it is doubtful whether it will have any currency at a Local Government election. There is no reason to believe that a shift in the mind has taken place in the voter during the last three years to suggest that a victory for the government at elections held for Pradeshiya Sabhas Municipal Councils and Urban Councils would result in the division of the country. That is assuming this subject figures at all in the mind of the voter whose main focus, no doubt, will purely be on who can provide them good roads, proper drinking water facilities and efficient clearance of their garbage.

SLAITO, THASL hail upcoming digital advertising campaign
In a joint communiqu, The Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO) and The Hotel Association of Sri Lanka (THASL) appreciated the efforts by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau (SLTPB) and Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) to expedite the digital advertising campaign planned for early 2018 and the global advertising campaign scheduled for mid of this year.
The promotional plans for Sri Lanka Tourism have been long overdue and the industry has felt the need to fast-track such plans to lend high visibility to the destination.
Overall, arrivals to Sri Lanka have slowed, with only a 3.2% growth in arrivals until end-December 2017. Sri Lankas tourism industry has felt the downturn during summer 2017 and winter 17/18 due to increased room inventory and aggressive promotions from competing destinations such as Thailand, Malaysia and Indonesia. However, the recent promotional work under taken by the SLTPB has resulted in an increase of 24% in the Dutch market and 7.3% in the U.K. market. SLTPB Chairman Udaya Nanayakkara together with SLTDA Chairman Kavan Ratnayake have been instrumental in fast tracking the International Marketing Campaign within the brief span of five months.
The communiqu further congratulated the Boards of SLTPB and SLTDA for pushing promotions despite various obstacles and challengers. The cooperation between SLTPB and SLTDA has is a major contributor to the effectiveness and speed of the promotions.
Both Associations received support from their respective board nominees who made tireless efforts to voice industry concerns. This has resulted in the action plan passed by the respective board targeting spends in excess of Rs 5.3bn for calendar year 2018, the highest estimated spends ever in the history of Sri Lanka tourism.
This further strengthens the plans and guidelines identified by the Tourism Task Force under the advice of the Prime Minster and Minister of Tourism and Christian affairs.
The Associations have urged board members to continue to support the respective boards of SLTPB and SLTDA and to make the Sri Lanka Tourism a major contributor to the economic development of the country.
The board of SLTPB consists of 11 members of which three are nominated by SLAITO and three by THASL as per the Tourism Act No: 38 of 2005.

SLC well towards achieving sporting  and financial success  Thilanga
Sri Lanka Cricket president Thilanga Sumathipala has said that Sri Lanka Cricket is in the right direction towards achieving the twin goals of sporting and financial success.
Addressing the employees of Sri Lanka Cricket, while commencing work for the year 2018 at the SLC, Sumathipala said within two years of his election, he along with the SLC employees was able to turnaround Sri Lanka Crickets financial position from poor to strong.
When we took over two years ago, SLC was indebted for a sum of Rs. 5 billion and we were in a quandary as to how we are going to turnaround SLC, now, after two years, I am happy to say we are making profits, Sumathipala said. When we entered the fray, ICC had only allocated US$ 80 million for the members during its paying cycle, but with the efforts I made to strengthen the relationship with other members it yielded a collaborative effort to increase it to US$ 120 million, thus raising the SLCs revenue drastically, he said.
Speaking further Sumathipala said, Sri Lanka Cricket is now financially stable with a steady flow of revenues coming from different sources, while the organization has ensured that financial accountability is maintained at every level, with prudent mechanisms put in place for monitoring.
Asset management firm
Sumathipala said plans are underway to establish an asset management firm as a subsidiary of the Sri Lanka Cricket to better manage cash flows of SLCs major assets. He said, the money generated out of the SLC asset management operations will be utilized to finance the maintenance of SLC facilities across the country, which as of now incurs millions and is borne out by the revenues generated by the SLC.
Development of the game
According to Sumathipala, SLC has taken several steps to ensure the development of the game. Among those steps are, decentralizing of powers to the District and Provincial Associations to run the game in their respective regions.
When we took over, SLC was controlling 132 clubs, now we have brought them down to 24 and decentralized the power to provincial and district associations, thus giving them the decision making powers, the SLC president said.
He also said, steps were taken to bring in the age level cricket starting from under 15, 17, 19, 21 and 23, from both district and provincial level cricket under the direct supervision of the SLC to ensure that grassroots level cricket development stays in line with SLCs vision.
The SLC president also said steps were taken to enhance the knowledge level of local coaches by sending selected coaches for overseas training programs.
Player focus
Sumathipala said, Sri Lanka Cricket has taken all the required steps to ensure that players of the national team are looked after well. He said, the introduction of a strong insurance cover for the national players, which is on par with any other international cricketer, introducing a performance based bonus system for playersand providing contracts for 70 first class cricketers, apart from the contracts given for the national players are among the steps taken to ensure the sustainability of the players.

Smith praises Australia's 'exceptional' bowlers
SYDNEY: Captain Steve Smith has praised the collective efforts of his exceptional four front-line bowlers for contributing to Australia's crushing 4-0 Ashes series win over England Monday.
The Australians rounded off a dominant five-match series with an innings and 123-run hammering of the beleaguered tourists on the final day of the fifth Sydney Test.
Mitchell Starc, John Hazlewood, Pat Cummins and spinner Nathan Lyon all finished with 20 or more wickets in the series to take 87 in total to dominate the England batsmen.
Despite this, Smith was not prepared to rate them higher than the quartet of Mitchell Johnson, Ryan Harris, Peter Siddle and Lyon who bowled Australia to a 5-0 whitewash in the last Ashes series in Australia in 2013-14. I think all the bowlers did an exceptional job, he told reporters.
Each of our bowlers have over 20 wickets which showed that the guys have bowled together as a group, bowled in partnerships, bowled for one another and helped us take the 80-odd wickets that we've needed to take four Test matches. But he stopped of declaring them a better bowling unit than their predecessors four years ago. I think they are all great bowlers. I can't put any of them ahead of each other, he said. I think both attacks were outstanding and got the job done. I can't say any one is better than the other. Cummins, who captured four for 39 to finish man-of-the-match in Sydney, finished as the leading wicket-taker in the series with 23 at 24.65 and played in all five Tests.

## Title: Speak not so loud!

Speak not so loud!
A bench headed by Acting Chief Justice Gita Mittal issued the notice on the PIL filed by social activist Sanjjiiv Kkumaar. Sanjjiiv, in his PIL, traced the advent of all religions in India to say, Hinduism is 4,000 years old, Jainism is 2,600 years old, Buddhism is 2,500 years old, Christianity is 2,000 years old, Islam is 1,400 years old, Sikhism is 500 years old and on another hand, moving coil current loudspeakers are not even 100 years old. Thus, its beyond doubt, and as facts and truth speaks for itself per se, loudspeakers were never a part of any religion....
As loudspeakers is not part of/intrinsic to any of the religions as all religions are 4,000 to 500 years old whereas loudspeaker came into existence in 1924, that is less than 100 years and hence, banning them will not violate Article 25 or 26 of the Constitution.
Mans house is his castle, loudspeakers breach right to be left alone
The petitioner relied heavily on the privacy judgment of the Supreme Court to say that its use is breach of privacy. Every democratic country sanctifies domestic life; it is expected to give him rest, physical happiness, peace of mind and security. In the last resort, a persons house, where he lives with his family, is his castle; it is his rampart against encroachment on his personal liberty, it said. It quoted an observation made by Justice DY Chandrachud in the privacy judgment that. Ones house is like a castle to him. If loudspeakers are encroaching ones right of spatial control (ones home), ones right to left alone, then whats the meaning of fundamental rights It will be just on paper.
Hence to protect and uphold the fundamental rights of ones left alone, personhood (physical and mental peace), spatial control  Loudspeakers need to go...
Blaring loudspeakersin places of worship
The Calcutta High Court on November 21, 1996 banned the use of loudspeakers at all places of worship, irrespective of religion. A division bench of Justice Bhagabati Prasad Benerjee and Justice A. K. Chakraborty in their ruling stated that as India is a secular state the ban would cover all religions and steps to control noise pollution should cover all religious communities. The ban which minimised noise levels in the city during the durga-pujas and Kalipujas would also cover gurudwaras and Mosques all over West Bengal.
The Muslim calls for prayer follow the tradition of Jews and Christians where the bell was, and still is, in vogue. While the church bell peeled with the ringer working on the rope connecting the bell hung from the lofty belfry, the Muslim priest exhorts his flock through his sonorous voice praising Allah.
For instance, as noted above, one of the roles of church bell or azan was/is to tell the faithful about the time for prayer or service. That originated at a time when there were no clocks or watches and communities lived in exclusive clusters  like oasis in Arabian deserts. Also, at the time of the origin of azan there were no loudspeakers to amplify the voice.
Today, clocks and watches are widely in vogue. And there are mobiles all over to show time or even to ring an alarm. In the context of noise pollution, bells and prayer calls are great irritants to senior citizens, ailing patients and shift workers catching up on sleep. It applies to temple bells as well, specially as they have no fixed timings and get activated by visiting devotees. One can have symbolic, low decibel bells that please the gods/deities without disturbing irritable humans. Such competitive surrender of irritants can be infectious and lead to sustainable noise pollution control, peace and harmony.
Shouldnt there be a ban on loudspeakers at religious places
In March 2016, castigating the practice of using loudspeakers at religious places of various religions, causing noise pollution, the Madras High Court observed, It appears that these institutions (places of worship of different faiths) perceive that the blessing of God cannot be obtained unless there is loud noise. Prayers for all religions have been going on from ancient time even when electricity did not exist.
What Law says: Is it legal to use loudspeakers in religious places
Cases on noise pollution
During the case of Church of God (Full Gospel) in India v. K.K.R. Majestic Colony Welfare Assn, 2000CriLJ4022, The Supreme Court held that the Court may issue directions in respect of controlling noise pollution, even if such noise was a direct result of and was connected with religious activities. It said, Undisputedly, no religion prescribes that prayers should be performed by disturbing the peace of others nor does it preach that they should be through voice amplifiers or beating of drums. In a civilized society in the name of religion, activities which disturb old or infirm persons, students or children having their sleep in the early hours or during daytime or other persons carrying on other activities cannot be permitted.
SC in the case of Noise Pollution (V), In re, (2005) 5 SCC 733 (this case has since been reopened) has held as under: 150. Several interlocutory applications have been filed in this Court, wherein it was pleaded that restriction on bursting of firecrackers in the night should be removed during Diwali. Similar relaxation was demanded for other festivals. These applications highlighted practices prevalent in some of the western countries wherein such relaxation is allowed. We dont think its justified to grant any such relaxation. Indian society is pluralistic. People of India belong to different castes and communities and have belief in different religions and celebrate different festivals. We are tolerant of each other. There is unity in diversity. If relaxation is allowed to one there will be no justification for not permitting relaxation to others. If we do so, relaxation will become the rule. It will be difficult to enforce restriction.
Azaan on loudspeakers is impermissible
The Calcutta High Court has held in the case of Moulana Mufti Syed Mohammed Noorur Rehman Barkati v. State of West Bengal as under: Accordingly, it cannot be said that for giving Azaans the applicants should be allowed to use microphones in the early hours of the day and that is before 6 oclock in the morning. Azaan is definitely an integral and essential part of the Muslim religion, but use of microphones is certainly not an integral part of Azaan.
Right to sleep peacefully is a fundamental right
Maidan Incident (In Re:) the Apex Court dealt with the issue of privacy as a part of Article 21 of the Constitution of India and held that the right to sleep has always been treated to be a fundamental. The Apex Court held thus: 327. Sleep is essential for a human being to maintain the delicate balance of health necessary for its very existence and survival. Sleep is, therefore, a fundamental requirement without which the existence of life would be in peril. To disturb sleep, therefore, would amount to torture, which is now accepted as a violation of human right.
The law on noise pollution
Rule 5 of the Noise Pollution (Regulation and Control) Rules, 2000 under the Environment (Protection) Act, 1986 read: Restrictions on the use of loudspeakers/public address system:
n A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used except after obtaining written permission from the authority.
n A loudspeaker or a public address system shall not be used at night (between 10.00 p.m. to 6.00 a.m.) except in closed premises for communication within, e.g. auditoria, conference rooms, community and banquet halls.
n Notwithstanding anything contained in sub-rule (2), the State Government may, subject to such terms and conditions as are necessary to reduce noise pollution, permit use of loudspeakers or public address systems during night hours (between 10.00 p.m. to 12.00 midnight) on or during any cultural or religious occasion of a limited duration not exceeding 15 days in all during a calendar year.
These are matters which certainly seek reflection even in our country.

Sri Lanka consumer protection laws not adequate - Bathiudeen
Sri Lanka will extensively review its consumer protection regulations, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said on Monday (8).
He said the current framework for safeguarding consumer wellbeing does not appear to be satisfactory anymore in the face of huge changes and complexities in modern consumer trends and dynamics. Minister Bathiudeens statement was delivered by Additional Secretary M. A. Thajudeen to a conference of United Nations, European Union, and Sri Lankan government representatives at the Shangri-La Hotel Monday morning. The goal of the five-day conference is to bring Sri Lankas standards in line with the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection and implement regulatory impact analysis across agencies to generate better policy.
Bathiudeen said 100 countries around the world have already used the guidelines to strengthen their national consumer safeguard regulations.
He said that in a changing world, its time for Sri Lanka to catch up.
Emerging complexities in consumption, such as the lack of transparency in trans-national production processes, complicated liability relations, and the increase of online payments, are major new concerns that the existing mechanisms in Sri Lanka are not able to respond well to, he said. Therefore both our backward mechanisms, and rapid changes in consumption formats, now demand urgent reforms to our policies of consumer wellbeing.
The initiative is funded as part of an 8 million Euro grant from the EU and the International Trade Centre, Bathiudeen added.

Sri Lankan banks to step up Basel III Tier 2 Issuance - Fitch
Sri Lankan banks are likely to significantly boost issuance of Basel III-compliant Tier 2 instruments in 2018, says Fitch Ratings.
Most banks will need to raise capital to meet higher Basel III requirements that take full effect in January 2019, and to support balance-sheet expansion. Banks will also need to undertake significant Basel III Tier 2 issuance, as a result of the phasing out of legacy instruments - and ongoing redemptions. Around Rs119 billion in qualifying legacy Basel II Tier 2 instruments that are subject to a 20% discount per year were outstanding at end-3Q17.
Fitch has rated Basel III instruments of four Sri Lankan banks since the framework was introduced in July 2017. Only Sampath Bank has so far undertaken public issuance in the domestic market. Our approach to rating Basel III instruments is to notch down from an issuers anchor rating based on non-performance and loss severity risk, as per our global criteria.
The anchor rating is usually based on the banks standalone strength, because in most cases sovereign support cannot be relied upon to extend to a banks junior debt. Fitch says it has followed this approach for Sampath Banks Basel III-compliant Tier 2 issuance and in our expected ratings of proposed issuance by Seylan Bank and Nations Trust Bank.
That said, there is a case to factor extraordinary sovereign support into the anchor ratings of Basel III Tier 2 instruments for banks that have strong state linkages and are also systemically important, as the state is likely to have a strong interest in supporting the instruments of these banks before loss-absorption features are triggered.
The anchor rating for instruments of such banks is their support-driven IDR or support-driven National Long-Term Rating. We took this approach in our rating of Bank of Ceylons proposed issuance.
Fitch does not generally apply any incremental notching to Basel III Tier 2 instruments for non-performance risk, which is judged to be broadly similar to that of senior debt. These instruments usually specify that losses are triggered only at a banks point of non-viability, and do not include any going-concern loss absorption. In Sri Lanka, the loss-absorption trigger point for Basel III Tier 2 instruments is defined as a decision by the Monetary Board that a write-down or public-sector support is necessary to avoid a bank becoming non-viable.
Loss-severity risk is higher for Basel III Tier 2 instruments than for senior debt. Fitch says their usual approach is therefore to rate the instrument one notch below the anchor rating in cases of below-average recoveries, and by two notches in the case of poor recoveries - such as when there is a significant risk of full contractual write-down.

Steinfeld hesitant to release vulnerable new music
Actress-turned-singer Hailee Steinfeld is taking her time in putting together her debut album because she is still grappling with allowing herself to be so "vulnerable" in her music.
The Pitch Perfect 3 star dropped her first single, Love Myself, in 2015, and has since collaborated on hits with DNCE, Zedd, Alesso, Florida Georgia Line, and Watt.
Her continued music output has led fans to wonder when her first studio album will be released, and up until now, Hailee has simply told them "soon", but she admits they may have to wait a little longer.
"I'm so over saying the word 'soon' because I've used it too many damn times," she told Marie Claire magazine. "I don't even know what it means anymore."
Hailee insists she is eager to share new material, but she is hesitant to open herself up emotionally in a way she's only ever done on camera, when she's able to hide behind her character's persona.
"As an actor, I'm masked by characters, protected by them," she explained. "But as a musician, it's my story, my voice, my face.
"It's me on that stage talking about that horrible experience I went through and (saying), 'Here, I'm going to sing about it.' It's such a different kind of vulnerable. To connect with fans, there's pressure in feeling like I have to do things that I'm uncomfortable with, in terms of opening up enough about myself."
It's not the only aspect of her life Hailee has been protective about - the 21-year-old has the same approach when it comes to romantic relationships, even though she's been dating social media personality Cameron Smoller since 2016.
"I'm trying to protect myself and have a bit of a guard up," she admitted, "but I also want to fall in love and know why love hurts." Music News

There is no might, there is an album
Apparently, Selena Gomez can't keep her hands or  thankfully  her new music to herself. In an interview with BBC Radio 1's Nick Grimshaw, the pop star  who has released four singles in the last year  revealed that her next album will be out "very soon."
"There is no 'might,' there is an album," Selena said. "I think it's fair to say that people know the year I've had, and I've poured my heart into my music and I wanted it to be fresh. It wasn't really about charts for me, or numbers. It was more just about, what could I creatively do for my music. So, yes, I can successfully say that my inspiration for this next album is in full motion and it will be very soon."
The "Wolves" singer, who underwent a kidney transplant over the summer and has been open about her anxiety and other mental health struggles, told Nick that making the album has been a healing process for her. "I did it for over a year, so it was [therapeutic] for me, but now it's exciting to be in a place where I love surprising people and creating new areas of music I can explore," she said. "And I'll get to be present, you know I was taking some time off for my health and it was good, but now I get to be here. I'll be back."
Selena has been teasing her upcoming album quite a bit lately. When "Wolves" dropped at the end of October, she spoke to Zane Lowe for an Apple Music interview. "To be honest, I feel like I have two albums already completed," she said. "I'm wanting to figure it out. It's a lot sooner than I think people anticipate, but I also want to call the shots. I want it to be good. I want it to be ready. I don't want to do anything that feels forced. It'll be soon, I definitely feel stoked about putting a piece together."
And over the weekend, Sel shared a photo on her (no longer private) Instagram of her singing into a microphone, presumably in a recording studio. "Currently. Until the next year. Here's where I'll be," she captioned the photo. Teen Vogue

Trump gives 200,000 Salvadoreans deadline to leave US

Donald Trump's administration has decided to cancel permits that allow nearly 200,000 people from El Salvador to live and work in the US.
They were granted Temporary Protected Status (TPS) after earthquakes rocked the Central American country in 2001.
Salvadoreans now have until September 9, 2019 to leave or face deportation, unless they find a legal way to stay.
The Trump administration has already removed TPS protection from tens of thousands of Haitians and Nicaraguans.
Protections for Salvadoreans were set to expire on Monday, after nearly two decades of holding the humanitarian status due to the impact of the natural disaster that killed more than 1,000 people.
The latest announcement comes four months after the government said it planned to scrap an Obama-era scheme, DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), that protected young undocumented immigrants, mostly Latin Americans, from deportation.
Lawmakers in Congress have been given until March to decide on the fate of the 800,000 so-called Dreamers affected by the DACA decision.
What does it mean for Salvadoreans in US
Their protection will not be terminated until September 9, 2019"to allow for an orderly transition", the Department of Homeland Security said in a statement announcing the decision on Monday.
"The original conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist," the agency said.
"Thus, under the applicable statute, the current TPS designation must be terminated."
Who will be most affected
The move will end the protected status of nearly 200,000 Salvadoreans living across America, forcing them to face possible deportation.
More than 190,000 children born in the US to Salvadoreans with TPS will also be affected.
While the children themselves are US citizens thanks to the practice of granting citizenship to babies born on US soil, their parents will not automatically be allowed to stay and families could be broken up.
Salvadoreans with TPS are established in large numbers in California, Texas and around the US capital, Washington DC.
According to the Center for Migration Studies, they represent more than 135,000 households across the country, with a quarter of them home-owners:
88% part of the labour force
10% self-employed
10% married to US citizens
What is Temporary Protected Status
The programme was created in 1990 and authorises immigrants from several countries to live and work in the US lawfully, regardless of whether they entered the country legally or not.
It is only granted to countries affected by armed conflict, environmental disaster, or epidemics.
Ten countries, making up over 300,000 US immigrants, have been granted TPS protections since it was first signed into law by President George Bush.
Special protection status for 59,000 Haitians and 5,300 Nicaraguans was terminated late last year, and also takes effect in 2019.
Salvadoreans are the largest group by far to receive TPS, after two earthquakes devastated communities the country in March 2001.
Over the next 15 years, the programme was re-authorised by US presidents several times.
What has reaction been
Mark Krikorian of the Center for Immigration Studies, hailed Monday's decision as a "long overdue move".
"The idea that there should be a 'temporary status' that lasts for 19 years is ridiculous," he told BBC News.
He believed the TPS law should be scrapped and replaced with a process in which Congress would have to vote to re-authorise temporary immigration protections.
Meanwhile, Salvadoreans with the TPS status criticised the decision.
"My life is here," Minda Hernndez, a 48-year-old housekeeper from Long Island who left El Salvador 20 years ago, was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency.
"This is where my home is, where I pay my taxes. I am happy here - even if I work myself to death."
The Salvadorean government has been lobbying the US to extend protections for people from their country living in the US.
El Salvador's Foreign Minister Hugo Martnez said his government would work with the Trump administration to find a permanent solution for Salvadoreans working in the US.
Money earned and sent back to families in El Salvador also makes a valuable contribution to the country's economy, the Center for American Progress says. The think tank estimates that in 2015, remittances made up more than 15% of El Salvador's GDP.
Democrats in Congress have condemned the decision, with many criticising the move for ignoring the violence in El Salvador, which has one of the world's highest murder rates.
"Thousands of families will worry about being torn apart because of this callous and irrational decision," Washington DC Mayor Murial Bowser said.
Nevada Senator Catherine Cortez Masto said it was "a poignant reminder that we have an anti-immigrant president who turns his back on hardworking families and insists on governing by fear and intimidation".
Consulates in the US are offering advice to Salvadoreans.

US jobs growth loses  steam in December
US employers added fewer jobs than expected in December, capping a year of slowing jobs growth.
Non-farm payrolls rose by 148,000 last month, amid losses in the retail sector, the Labor Department said. But the unemployment rate held steady at 4.1%, the lowest it has been since 2000.
Analysts say the tightening labour market, which makes it harder to hire, is driving a broader slowdown in job creation.
The US has experienced years of economic expansion, which has boosted economic growth above 3% in recent quarters and produced annual job gains exceeding 2 million for the past seven years. The gains are making inroads among parts of the workforce that have been slower to benefit from the economic recovery.
Among black workers, for example, the unemployment rate fell to 6.8% last month - the lowest since at least 1972, when Labor Department data starts.
Nationally, the unemployment rate has hovered at 4.1% since October, a rate not seen since 2000.

Will Katy Perry be American Idol's new Simon Cowell

This isAmerican Idol...making a comeback!
ABC's revival ofAmerican Idolis coming on March 11 and the new judging panel,Katy Perry, Lionel Richie, and Luke Bryan, is determined to give America its new star...but it wouldn't have happened ifRyan Seacrest, who hosted all 15 previous seasons, didn't return.
"We can't do the show with Ryan," executive producerTrish Kinanesaid at the 2018 Winter TCA Press Tour on Monday. "Ryan has been there right from the beginning and it wouldn't be the same without him."
For Seacrest, who added taking over asKelly Ripa's co-host onLive With Kelly and Ryan, moving to New York for the gig,to his ever-busy schedule last year, the decision to come back"was a logistic thing."
With the original host in place, ABC decided to find three new faces to join the franchise and take over from judges of Idol past, includingSimon Cowell, its most infamous judge thanks to his no-holds-barred critiques.
So will Perry, Bryan or Richie serve as the newIdol's "mean" judge
"I'm blunt, but I can't be mean 'cause I'm a woman," Perry joked, before Kinane said, "She's not mean, but she's brutally honest."
Perry then went on to say no one is the new Simon Cowell because he's an executive.
"I love Simon, he's my favorite judge," she said. " think we all have our expertise. Luke can speak on a lot more country things, Lionel can speak on everything because he's a legend, I have my pop lane... I think we all bring strengths."
And for the "Swish Swish" singer, the "biggest gift" of joining the show after "circling" it for the several years has been being inspired by the aspiring contestants, recalling how she struggled early on in her career.
"The biggest gift for me personally is being re-inspired by their raw dreams, their raw ambition, their hope, and be like, I was there ten years ago," she said. "I had two cars repossessed, I had three labels drop me, I was couch-surfing...I was eating Trader Joes' frozen chicken nuggets every day of the week. I know exactly where you are."

Vijay Chandar, whos directing Vikram and Tamannaah in Sketch, is confident about the film, which is set for a Pongal release. The filmmaker is particular thrilled about singing the Atchi Putchi song thats doing the rounds on social media. He has also written the lyrics for it.Vijay tells us, Sketch is a romantic story with mass elements incorporated into it. While Vikram plays a guy from north Chennai, Tamannaah will be seen as a college-goer. Soori, Radha Ravi, Sriman, Ravi Kishan and RK Suresh form the supporting cast.Heaping praise on Vikram, he adds, Without him, theres no Sketch. Despite doing many films, hes extremely down-to-earth and friendly. For instance, some days, we couldnt get a caravan. He was quite understanding, and used a car to get ready on the sets. He was encouraging throughout, and did exactly what the script needed. In fact, hes the reason behind me singing and writing songs.
On roping in the actor, he says, Vikram has done almost everything from local to classy roles.
I want my film to cater to even B and C centres. I am sure Sketch will be a treat to the audience, who want to see him in a different dimension. My film will also remind you of Sethu!

Government is committed to bring Lasanthas  murderers to justice
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday said the present government is committed to providing the Criminal Investigation Department and the Attorney Generals Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge.
The Minister in a statement to mark the ninth death anniversary of the slain editor, called upon all including media institutions the legal fraternity, to render all possible aid to the police in this investigation, by seeking out and volunteering relevant information, identifying and safeguarding possible witnesses and responding to any requests promptly and thoroughly
Only by the conviction in a court of law of those responsible for this insoluble bloodstain in our national history, can we honour Lasanthas sacrifice, the Minister said
Full statement:
Today, January 8, 2018, marks the ninth anniversary of one of the most heinous crimes ever committed against Sri Lankas constitutionally guaranteed right to freedom of expression. It was nine years ago, today, at 10:45 AM that I received the news that Lasantha Wickrematunge, the fearless editor of The Sunday Leader, and my dear friend, had been ambushed and attacked as he drove to work. A few hours later when Lasantha succumbed to his injuries, Sri Lanka lost one of the most enigmatic and courageous journalists that the world had ever known.
In the aftermath of this cowardly assassination, the media, legal fraternity, civil society and the political opposition parties joined together as one, demanding justice for Lasantha by way of a thorough and impartial investigation and condemning those who gave aid, comfort and shelter to his killers. For six years, we struggled in vain, until on January 8, 2015, the people of Sri Lanka threw out the Rajapakse regime and placed their faith in the Unity government led by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
Our moral and civic duty to demand justice for Lasantha has been replaced with the responsibility for delivering that justice, by enabling and ensuring a thorough and impeccably independent police investigation, led by the officers of the Criminal Investigation Department. This investigation has already exposed the intricacy of the measures taken by the previous regime to cover up the murder. From the false cause-of-death in the original post-mortem report to the irregular transfer of the investigation away from the CID, and the death of a key witness-turned-suspect in custody, it is clear that no stone was left unturned.
Despite these and whatever obstacles come before us, this government is committed to providing the CID and the Attorney Generals Department with whatever resources and support they require to indict and convict those who committed, aided and instigated Lasanthas murder. Failure is unacceptable. This is a debt of honour that we owe not just to Lasantha and his family, but also to the citizens of Sri Lanka, who have been deprived of one of the foremost champions of their democracy.
Today, I call upon all media institutions, the legal fraternity, private sector and civil society organisations, once again to unite with us in rendering all possible aid to the police in this investigation, by seeking out and volunteering relevant information, identifying and safeguarding possible witnesses and responding to any requests promptly and thoroughly. Only by the conviction in a court of law of those responsible for this insoluble bloodstain in our national history can we honour Lasanthas sacrifice

Lanka needs adopting coherent  regulations for development goals
UN Resident Coordinator and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Una Mc Cauley yesterday highlighted that Sri Lanka needs to adopt coherent regulations to achieve sustainable development goals within the stipulated time period.
She expressed these views speaking at a workshop on Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), organized by the Consumer Affairs Authority of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
The main objective of the workshop is to help Sri Lankan policymakers make informed decisions based on a cost benefit analysis of various regulations and their likely impact in society.
Cauley noted that this initiative would assist Sri Lanka to strengthen its ability to manage governance in an effective way.
Sometimes regulations are outdated, sometimes there are no regulations or regulations are weak.
It is important to periodically examine these regulations, and to correct them to make sure that these regulations produce intended objectives for what they have been issued and should produce results making the best use of available resources. Poor regulations increase the cost and decrease the economic development, ultimately creating complex situations.Regulation is not just important for your work, it is necessarily important for the broader development of the country. Lack of coherent regulations will create unintended results.This means that intended benefits are not realized. Regulations need to be designed in such a way to achieve set targets in the economy as well as the society.
Regulatory quality refers to the way regulations are conceived and made. It implies the design and the implementation of regulations in a way that effectiveness, efficiency, transparency and accountability are ensured, Cauley pointed out.
According to Cauley, transparency, regulations should incorporate the views of stakeholders and be prepared in an open way and regulations should be accountable for their regulatory decisions.
Regulations has a direct impact on the way economy and the society operate ; regulations are necessary as they are essential for consumers and environment protection to reduce risk and to ensure a fair level play in the economy. But they need to be proportionate, otherwise that create important distortions that can affect innovation, competition, competitiveness, trade.
She pointed out the necessity to regulate exhibiting regulations to create much needed benefits for economic and social development of the country.
Delivering the welcome speech at the workshop, Consumer Affairs Authority Chairman Hasitha Tillekeratne also noted that regulations plays an essential role in consumer protection, curtail pollution, prevent abuse, ensure safe food and protect public health .
They are crucial in promoting corporate interests as well as to preventing consumer exploitation.
The purpose of regulation is to provide protection, either to individuals, organizations and the environment protection, safety or health in the home or work poo lace or consumption of goods and services, regulations can have far reaching effects.
In the current dynamic market environment, regulatory agencies face challenges in managing markets effectively. Some regulations dont bring expected results due to various reasons and this is a cost to the economy .Therefore it is high time that all key regulatory agencies get together and review whether the regulations are effective to get expected economic and social benefits to the country.
Consumer International (CI) has announced the theme for World Consumer Rights Day 2018 as, making digital market places fairer, as a member organization of the consumer international, the Consumer Affairs Authority will be working this year to introduce measure to safeguard the digital consumers who will be using online marketing in their day today life, Tillekeratne noted that we have proposed new areas for the CAA Act, such as proud liability, product recall, and unfair terms in consumer contracts , online marketing of digital contents.

Raisa remembers Baappi
Address by Raisa Wickrematunge at the graveside memorial to mark ninth anniversary of Lasanthas murder
When I think of my uncle, or Baappi as my sister and I called him, my first image is of him pirouetting and saying Im a ballerina! This was in response to me asking him why he had such a special affinity for pink, because the last three times I had seen him, he was always wearing pale pink. To me, that memory best sums up Baappis spirit  irrepressible, charming, mischievous.
There are other images too. Images of him asking Whats for dinner while poking his fingers into saucepans in our kitchen, of prank calls (especially on April 1). Or of him telling someone, for the hundredth time, that it would be a disaster if I married someone whose last name was Soysa, because Id become Raisa Soysa, a joke which he cracked ever since he first heard about my parents choice of name, and a joke which never failed to annoy me.
Memories of him seriously telling me that my biggest test in the newsroom would be making the perfect cup of tea. I have to add that the reason I was in the newsroom at all was largely thanks to him, and his encouragement. Whenever he came to our house, he took the time to talk to the shy, awkward child sitting in her room with her nose in a book.
I never thought he noticed me any further than that  so I was surprised when he coaxed my parents to allow me to join The Sunday Leader. In doing so, he gave me a gift I can never hope to repay. Not just the ability to express myself, but also the ability to widen my own world view by opening my eyes to the many stories of poverty and injustice that surrounded me, and to which I would otherwise have remained oblivious.
I find it difficult to talk about these memories. Over the years, I have come to feel like those memories are treasured possessions. I worry that as time passes I might somehow lose the memory of his laugh, or the way it felt when he ruffled my hair. This is partly why it has been so difficult for me to speak at these services. It is a strange thing to find yourself being asked to examine your private memories and speak them aloud in this way.
But I am not unaware that at least, people are listening. My uncle happened to be killed in broad daylight, in Colombo, near an Air Force checkpoint and next to a High Security Zone. The way he was killed was clearly premeditated.
When they speak about Baappis case, they call it emblematic. A symbol. I discovered just how symbolic when I was covering the International Day to end Crimes of Impunity Against Journalists two years ago.
As part of the piece, I did for Groundviews, I spoke to Sandya Eknaligoda and the Editor of the Sunday Thinnakural, Bharathi Rajanayagam. On both occasions, it gave me a jolt to see photos of my uncle; pinned to the noticeboard in the Sunday Thinnakural, and on a wall in Sandyas home. Both of them spoke about Baappis case but also about the many others that have remained unresolved, to date.
According to CPJ, there are 19 journalists whose killings were due to the work they carried out, and under very trying circumstances.
The Journalists for Democracy in Sri Lanka have different figures, counting over 40 journalists and media workers killed, abducted or tortured while carrying out their work.
Each of those journalists had a family. Each of them have treasured memories of their loved ones, as I do. And they have the added pain that, apart from the one day a year that marked their death or disappearance, and some sporadic coverage on those days, their names and their work has been forgotten. So much so that, to my great shame when I visited the Sunday Thinnakural office, there were names and stories that I did not recognise.
Subramaniyam Sugitharajah, January 2006, Sudar Oli. Subash Chandraboas, April 2007. Mylvaganam Nimalarajan, October 2000. These names, and others dont receive the same attention or coverage as my uncles case. Why have we forgotten them
I realise that what I say has political implications. I have always shied away from the idea that the uncle I so loved should symbolise anything other than himself. This, too, has been the main reason why I did not speak out until now.
And yet the large crowds at his funeral, the rally outside on that day, the photos of my uncle pinned on the walls of the Sunday Thinnakural, and the people who attend this service speak otherwise.
I believe that, if Baappi were alive, he would not want us to forget those names. I believe that his voice would join mine, if he were still here. But he paid a price for his outspokenness. And so did all the others. I think that is important to remember on this day. Today marks nine years since Baappi decided to drive to work, even though there were men on motorbikes following him. In 2016, CPJ dropped Sri Lanka from its Impunity Index  largely due to the passage of time.
While the rest of the world moves on, we as family members continue to keep time. Certain days for me, will always have a painful significance. April Fools Day, the day when Baappi would prank call my mother, April 5, his birthday. And now, January 8. Over nine years, there has been little in terms of tangible progress in bringing the perpetrators of his murder to account. And we are the lucky ones  interest and investigations into so many of the other cases is not sustained.
I could end on that note, and say that things feel hopeless. But I think Baappi would not want me to give up so easily. I think he would not have given up so easily, either.
So instead, I am going to end with one plea. I would ask everyone gathered here, many of whom are here either because you knew and loved my uncle, or were inspired by him, to raise your voices against the injustice you encounter. I ask that, in whatever way you can, you ask difficult questions about what is right and wrong, not just of others, but also of yourself. And I ask that you work towards righting the wrongs you encounter, in whatever way you can.
Let us all work towards a society where critique is responded to with informed debate, not with senseless violence. Let us work towards a society in which all forms of violence are not tolerated or worse, hidden away, because they are inconvenient to examine.
I believe that that would be a beautiful way to preserve the memory of my uncle, who fought passionately for what he believed in.

Thaana Serndha Koottams Kamal Haasan connection
Thaana Serndha Koottam starring Suriya will be releasing at MC - Jaffna, MC - Colombo, Chella - Jaffna, Capitol, Kingsley, Cine City, Cine World, City Cinema - Mt. Lavinia (9.30 pm) and other film halls island wide from January 12 for Thai Pongal festivities
At the press meet of Thaana Serndha Koottam (TSK), Suriya said that the Censor Board appreciated director Vignesh Shivan for making a clean film. There wont be any smoking or drinking warning cards, he added.
Elaborating on why he chose TSK, the actor, who is happy that his film is getting released on a festival day after seven years, said, Kamal Haasans Sathya and Varumayin Niram Sigappu have always been my favourite films. My character in TSK will have traces of such characterisation.
Suriya feels that director Hari has been instrumental in his growth. I often discuss my films with Hari sir. When I told him about Vignesh, he suggested that I work with him. I met Vignesh and he narrated the script that he had kept aside for Sivakarthikeyan/Vijay Sethupathi. He said that the script was based on real-life incidents that happened in 1987, which was, of course, the inspiration behind the Hindi film, Special 26.
I sat down for discussion thinking that the story would be along similar lines. But I was suprised by Vigneshs different narration. He simply used those incidents as a backdrop and crafted his own screenplay.
On a lighter note, Suriya added that TSK was a different experience as far as shooting was concerned. Im so used to my characters being anger-driven, that for some of the scenes in this film, I carried that same attitude. But Vignesh would say, Sir, your character doesnt have to be angry here. Id immediately change my expressions. Right from my dialogue delivery to the body language, everything was new to me!
At the event, Suriya also congratulated Rajinikanth, Kamal Haasan and Vishal for embarking on their respective political journeys. - The Indian Express

Australia complete dominant 4-0 Ashes series rout of England
SYDNEY: Australia ruthlessly extinguished England's resistance to claim an innings victory in the fifth Ashes Test and complete a 4-0 series rout on the final day in Sydney on Monday.
The beleaguered tourists, with skipper Joe Root weakened by a stomach bug and unable to continue batting, dissolved after lunch, losing their last four wickets for their fourth comprehensive defeat of the series.
It has been a great couple of months. The cricket that we have played in the last couple of months has been outstanding, Australia skipper Steve Smith said.
We have just been able to get on top and win those key moments and not let them back in the game which is crucial. Paceman Pat Cummins led the Australian offensive in Sydney with four wickets for 39 to finish man-of-the-match and the leading wicket taker in the series with 23.
To get through the five Tests and end the series here at home. I couldn't asked for much more, said an ecstatic Cummins.
All four of Australia's front-line bowlers finished with 20 or more wickets each for the series.
I think all the bowlers did an exceptional job. The guys have bowled together as a group, bowled in partnerships, bowled for one another and helped us take the wickets that we've needed to take four Test matches, Smith added.
England finished at 180 for nine off 88.1 overs as Australia won by an innings and 123 runs.
It followed comprehensive losses on the troubled five-Test tour in Brisbane, Adelaide and Perth. The fourth Test was drawn in Melbourne.
Stricken Root did not come out to bat after lunch as he continued to experience discomfort after his overnight stomach bug.
He has a gastro bug and he has not been too well through the night and the heat yesterday didn't help. He is asleep in the dressing-room trying to recover, said vice-captain Jimmy Anderson, deputising for Root at the post-match presentations.
To be honest we have been outplayed in the key moments of each game, he added.
We have been in the games to an extent but just not been able to capitalise on any opportunities. Australia have played great in this series. - Chances disappear - Cummins struck twice in three balls after lunch, trapping Jonny Bairstow leg before wicket for 38 and having Stuart Broad caught behind off a brutish bouncer for four.
Mason Crane got another vicious Cummins bouncer which he gloved to wicketkeeper Tim Paine for two and Anderson was caught behind off Josh Hazlewood for two to end the innings.
Root went to hospital overnight with England initially saying he had severe dehydration after fielding and batting in intense heat on Sunday.
But team officials later said Root had in fact been weakened by the effects of a gastroenteritis bug.
He came out to bat on the dismissal of Moeen Ali for 13 an hour into the final day's play and reached his fifth half-century of the series, although he was unable to convert any of them to a century.
England's remote chances of saving the Test disappeared when Root failed to appear at the crease after lunch, retiring ill for a second time.
Spinner Nathan Lyon claimed Moeen's wicket for the seventh time in the series when he trapped him leg before in the morning session, which Moeen did not review.
Lyon took three wickets for 54 off 35 overs to finish with 21 wickets for the series and 290 in his career.
The Australians took a grip on the final Test with a massive 303-run innings lead and then reduced the battle-weary tourists to 93 for four by the close on the fourth day and finished off the job mid-afternoon Monday. All five Tests went into the fifth day, indicating the attritional nature of the series.

Australia - Sri Lanka trade reaches $1.3 bn in 2016-17
Trade between Australia and Sri Lanka has surged to a record high of A$1.3 billion in 2016-17, on the back of strong growth in trade in services, up more than 27 per cent. Growth for the year overall was more than 15 per cent, continuing the strong trend growth of 8.6 per cent over the past five years.
Education continues to grow as a pillar of the economic relationship with more than 9,500 enrolments by Sri Lankan students to study in Australia and thousands more pursuing Australian-affiliated studies locally. The rapid growth in Australian tourists visiting Sri Lanka (up almost 10 per cent for the year) saw Sri Lankas services exports to Australia grow by more than 36 per cent.
Merchandise trade remained steady at around $480 million, based on Sri Lankas traditional strengths in tea, textiles and rubber. Garments exports have grown strongly in the past year reflecting the decision by Australian retailers to source garments from Sri Lanka. Australias major exports of vegetables, dairy, wheat and machinery have also performed well. There are now more high quality Australian goods appearing on Sri Lankan supermarket shelves.
Welcoming the trade figures, Australias High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson said this years figures reflect the steady growth in commercial engagement between our two countries.
As close friends and Indian ocean neighbours, were now seeing the trade and investment relationship expand as Sri Lankas economy moves forwards and Australian companies take an increased interest in the Sri Lankan market.
During Prime Minister Turnbulls visit to Sri Lanka in November 2017, we signed the Australia-Sri Lanka Trade and Investment Framework Arrangement. The Arrangement provides a practical forum for our two governments to address trade issues. Our shared aim is to open up new commercial opportunities for business. Im pleased that inaugural talks under the arrangement will take place in Canberra in April 2018.
With the recent launch of direct flights between Colombo and Melbourne, we anticipate continued strong trade growth in 2017-18, the high commission said in a statement.

CALiper app to strengthen online bond trading
Sri Lankas first online trading app, CALliper, launched by Capital Alliance Ltd (CAL) will take government securities trading to the future and make it more accessible.
It was revealed that the CALiper digital app could facilitate online bond trading with just the click of a button.
According to CAL, the app offers an easy streamlined trading process which enables investors to manage their own portfolios.
At the launch ceremony, CAL Managing Director Gihan Hemachandra said that the apps dash in, dash board and dash out propositions make it a hassle-free and convenient wealth enhancement tool to revolutionize the bond trading arena and empowers investors to trade and grow their wealth on their own terms.
He said CALiper will help anybody to see not only prices but also to enable trading online like buying shares on the computer.
Hemachandra further said the objective of launching CALiper is to make the Sri Lankan bond market more transparent where everyone will have access to information.
Anybody could expect many benefits from CALiper as it trades Sri Lankan government bonds from any place in the world with a device such as Microsoft, IOS or Android which has access to the internet.
We also create a retail client base where Sri Lankan government bond market can be reached out to every day investors.
He said CALiper enables faster response times and up-to-date access to a personal portfolio and provides all the tools needed to measure, trade, monitor and observe government securities.
According to CAL, CALiper was developed by Finnovation and the app also won a bronze award in the Financial Industry Application category at the prestigious National Best Quality Awards.
Speaking further, Hemachandra said there is an immense need for transparency in the bond market and CALiper will help to deliver that along with greater accessibility to investors.
He said unlike the stock market, the bond market is structured as a wholesale market.
Finnovation Head of Software Uthpala Dissanayaka said CALiper has been developed to offer traders and investors of all experience levels the opportunity to make money on their own terms.
She said CALiper is available through website www.caliper.lk and thereafter it will be rolled out across other devices.

Charmed curse
One of Vijayas men went after her, although he was forbidden by the prince (for he thought), Only where there is a village are dogs to be found. Her mistress, a yakkhini named Kuvanna (Kuvani), sat there at the foot of a tree spinning, as a woman-hermit might.
When the man saw the pond and the woman-hermit sitting there, he bathed there and drank and taking young shoots of lotuses and water in lotus-leaves he came forth again. And she said to him: Stay! thou art my prey!. Then the man stood there as if fast bound. But because of the power of the magic thread she could not devour him, and though he was entreated by the yakkhini, the man would not yield up the thread. Then the yakkhini seized him, and hurled him who cried aloud into a chasm. And there in like manner she hurled (all) the seven hundred one by one after him.
So begins George Turnours edition of the Mahavansa. Named whether Kuveni or Kuvanna, the contemporary Sri Lankans need no introduction to this lady of yore. Kuveni has already established her brand name as the ladylove of our oldest king, Vijaya, who later abandoned her for his own good.
Authenticity
Ravibandu Vidyapathy
History, however, is subject to alteration and modification in the hands of artists. The modification could sound too euphemistic a term for distortion. But then no one looks for authenticity in artistic works. If you need authenticity, look up for academic sources and not artistic works. Ravibandu Vidyapathy seems to have taken a cue from this phenomenon.
His latest stage production, Kuvanna, a dance drama, reaches us as a slightly modified interpretation to the Mahavansa narrative of the monumental lady. King Vijaya seeks forgiveness from Kuveni in the prologue of the dance drama. But the lady is not ready to offer forgiveness yet. As scenes finally progress into the epilogue, Kuveni has grown soft enough to forgive the old king. Vijaya and Kuveni become the lovable, though not royal, pair. Their relationship becomes something that the contemporary audience should aspire to. Moulding heroines on stage is no strange encounter for Ravibandu. He introduced his own Lady Macbeth to the local stage only a few years ago. In contrast to Kuvanna, Lady Macbeth was introduced as a crafty and shrewd character in the centre of a political controversy.
Kuvanna is a teaching and learning project involving 200 students chosen from cultural centres across the island. The centres are under the direct command of the Cultural Affairs Ministry.
My objective is introducing the young talent to the national theatre. It is something more than an opportunity. They learn various techniques of choreography and theatre. At cultural centres, their education is confined to traditional dance. But when they are involved in a theatre production, their horizons expand, Vidyapathi elaborated.
Soft and feminine
A core objective of the Cultural Affairs Ministry is encouraging and promoting intangible traditional cultures  a move recommended by the UNESCO as well.
I see Kuveni as an ordinary woman. She deserves sympathy. Vijaya betrayed Kuveni. But I pity Vijaya as well, Vidyapathi takes stock of the historical account.
The Kohomba Kankariya element has also been syringed into the dance drama owing to its links with Kandyan tradition. Vidyapathi entertains two versions of Kuveni: one coarse, the other softer and more feminine. Unlike his previous ballet production, woven around Lady Macbeth, the audience will have a brief idea about the storyline as the chorus sings out.
They have already heard the Mahavansa version of the story. But with the chorus, the audience will have some idea about my interpretation. Some may understand and accept. Some may not understand and reject it altogether, Vidyapathy mused.
Kuvanna is an offshoot of the various workshops held across the country. In his capacity as Advisor to Cultural Affairs Minister S B Navinna on Arts, Ravibandu Vidyapathy has worked with several groups of young dancers.
Of course they are not equally talented. But they are brimming with talent. What they need is polishing up. We have chosen dancers aged between 12 and 25 based on a certain criterion. The ministry conducts intercultural competitions for dance. We have handpicked the winners for the dance drama.
Most productions that come to light on the Nelum Pokuna theatre cannot perform the same feat elsewhere. Does Vidyapathy face the same situation with a crew of over 200
Everything else of this play is simple. The rest is simple, basic and symbolic. So they are easy to transport. We are already making plans to take the production to other parts of the country as well, Vidyapathy said.
Kuveni has cast a curse on this island nation, we have been told. The curse remains active in Vidyapathys production but transforms into a charm along with the feminine softness inherent in her.

China to move millions from homes to eradicate poverty
Chinese authorities will move millions of people from their homes across the country as part of President Xi Jinpings goal of eradicating extreme poverty by 2020, a media report said.
Over the next three years, Xis anti-poverty crusade, which the President has declared one of the key themes of his second five-year term, will see marginalised rural dwellers resettled in new, government-subsidised homes, the Guardian report said. Some will be being moved to distant urban housing estates, others just to slightly less remote or unforgiving rural locations, the report said.
By 2020, Beijing hopes to have helped 30 million people rise above its official poverty line.
Chinas economic ascent has helped hundreds of millions lift themselves from poverty since the 1980s but in 2016 at least 5.7 per cent of its rural population still lived in poverty, according to a latest UN report, with that number rising to as much as 10 per cent in some western regions and 12 per cent among some ethnic minorities.
Last year, Guizhou, Chinas most deprived province, was aiming to move about 750,000 people to about 3,600 new locations.
More than 1 million people were set to be moved in Gansu, Sichuan and Guangxi while Yunnan province hoped to move about 677,000 people to nearly 2,800 new villages.
Mark Wang, a University of Melbourne scholar who studies Beijings use of resettlement to fight poverty, attributed Xis focus on the issue partly to the seven years he spent in the countryside during Maos Cultural Revolution, the Guardian reported.

Buddha Sasana Karya Mandalaya on proposed new Constitution
It is reported, the Buddha Sasana Karya Mandalaya [BSKM] has objected to their placement words The Republic of Sri Lanka with the word Sri Lanka. Let us critically analyse what is in the existing constitution which reads  CHAPTER II -Buddhism-9  The Republic of Sri Lanka shall give to Buddhism the foremost place and accordingly it shall be the duty of the State to protect and foster the Buddha Sasana while assuring to all religions the rights granted by Article 10 and 14[1][e].
If one critically analyse and understand the words Buddha Sasana it includes or encompasses the Buddhist clergy. Under the guise of protecting and fostering Buddhism, it is obvious the BSKSM takes it as the State should also protect and foster the Bikkhu Sasana, the Buddhist monks as well. What does this mean The State is legally bound to grant whatever these monks want personal, in the way of employment in the government sector, luxury donations such as expensive comfortable cars, State recognition at State functions, diplomatic passports etc. and claim these as requirements to fostering Buddhism.
The State  the politicians readily grant these requests not to protect and foster Buddhism, but in return expect these monks to play active politics to come back to power.
This was amply demonstrated when some members of this same BSKSM distributed sil redi, conducted well-advertised Bodhi Poojas at the last Presidential and General Elections for a particular candidate and political party to come to power for personal favours granted.
Some have allowed their temple premises to be used as party offices, some organise Pindapatha to collect funds to pay a fine imposed by courts. That is the sad picture when the state takes the responsibility rather than allow the Buddhists, Buddhist organisations and genuine Buddhist monks to foster and propagate Buddhism and thereby gain merit.
In view of the above reasons not to politicise Buddhism it is best for, those who are drafting the New Constitution use the words Sri Lanka instead of the existing words Republic of Sri Lanka and the word State where it is not applicable. It is also advisable to include the setting up of an organisation to discipline those errant monks, in consultation with Maha Nayaka Theras and Heads of other Nikayas and keep them at temples to perform their legitimate religious functions. That is one way and an urgent need to save, protect and foster Buddhism.
Hope this will catch the eyes of those concerned in drafting the New Constitution and consider this as a submission to the Commission to save Buddhism from those unscrupulous monks who have a hidden agenda.

Combined efforts to protect jumbos, other animals
The Wildlife officers, Police and Security Forces are to launch combined operations to protect the elephant population and wild animals in forest reserves.
The decision was taken by the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry in the wake of the escalated number of elephant deaths last year.
The strategic plan of carrying out combined operations will be handed over to Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera on January 16. It has been prepared by a committee comprising the representatives of the Wildlife Department, Forest Conservation Department, Mahaweli Authority, Archeological Department, and Police and Security Forces. Its basic plan will be handed over to the minister today.
The plan has been made after careful study of the geographical location of forest reserves, the behaviour of wild animals and other related matter. The plan aims at combating wildlife crimes in a more effective manner.
The Security Forces and Police personnel will conduct the operations in forest reserves subject to the approval of the Director Generals of Wildlife, Forest Conservation and Archeological Departments.
Environmental activists and wildlife enthusiasts raised concerns over the killing of several tuskers in the recent past, including Galgamuwe Dala Poottuwa. According to the wildlife statistics, 279 elephant deaths had been reported in the island in 2016. A considerable number of elephant deaths occur each year due to gun-shot injuries, hakka patas (explosives), electrocution, poisoning and train accidents.

Jumanji: welcome to the jungle
Crowd-pleasing drama
It may not be the best production of its nature but Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is quite entertaining and watchable. Four teenagers who have served detention find themselves taking on avatars entirely different to themselves and being sucked into a video game titled Jumanji.
Enter Dwayne Johnson, Jack Black, Kevin Hart and Karen Gillan. They are later accompanied by Nick Jonas as Alex. More shock awaits them as they discover that they not only have to play the game but they need to survive it as well. Each player is given three lives and they need to work as a team and embark on the most dangerous adventure of their lives. The only way out of the game is to get a magical jewel of the jungle and return it back to the eye socket of a statue.
What is truly delightful about the movie is that it spends only a few minutes to bring forth the characteristics of the teenagers before us before diving into action. Tons of belly laughs await us when we discover that the teens have taken on personalities which might have been in their nightmares as they are completely their opposites.
For example nerdy Alex becomes Dwayne Johnsons Dr Smolder Bravestone, imposing US football player Fridge winds up in teeny-tiny form as Kevin Hart; wallflower Martha becomes hotpants-wearing sexy Ruby Roundhouse and It Girl Bethany winds up as a tubby middle aged professor named Shelly Oberon. Watching them spar verbally and sometimes physically with each other, while playing the game will leave you in tears.
Quite a few films which use humans as pawns in games have entered the Hollywood scene of late. Harry Potter and the Sorcerers Stone had wizard chess, with the pieces coming alive while the renowned Hunger Games trilogy deals with the brutal game of using the less privileged as victims of entertainment for those wealthy citizens in the Capitol. David Finchers The Game and Danny Boyles The Beach too include scenes which visualize a game. In this light Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is not a new concept but what is refreshing is the way it is presented.
Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle is screening at Liberty by Scope Cinemas.

The show was titled Super Golden Chimes - Super concert with Milton Mallawaarachi. It was also Milton's very first solo concert. Damayantha had just completed his AL's when he presented the Super concert.
Following the successful presentation of concert in 1975 Damayantha left for UK to pursue his higher studies in Hotel management. In 2001 Damayantha got back into local show biz with Tribute to Clarence which was a fund raiser for his Alma mater Ananda College Colombo.
His entertainment company at the time was known as DR Entertainments where he was supported by Rajiv Sebastian. Damayantha presented several shows prior to setting up his own show biz company DK Promotions in 2004. In the past 17 years to date Damayantha has presented more than 100 shows with different titles and concepts.
The shows presented were not only for Sir Lankan but also International artists such as world famous Sir Cliff Richard live in concert in 2007, Daniel O'Donnell in 2014 and 2017, Tony Christies in 2017 to name just a few.
DK promotions have presented some of the shows in collaboration with various schools and organizations as fund raisers. Most leading singers and musicians have worked with DK Promotions in presenting their 40th and 50th anniversary concerts.
Damayantha emphasized on the point that at all times his prime motive was to provide quality entertainment to the Sri Lankan public.
"Show biz was never a business for me it was only a passion. In fact I have lost millions in presenting some expensive shows specially the ones where I featured foreign artists" added Damayantha.

Deutsche Bank to take 1.5 bn US tax hit
Deutsche Bank will take a 1.5bn (1.3bn) charge following changes to the US tax code, meaning it will not make a profit for 2017.
The bank said its trading revenue in the fourth quarter also declined about 22% year-on-year, amid lower market volatility and less client activity.
Shares in Deutsche fell nearly 6% after the announcement.
The German lender also posted annual losses in 2016 and 2015.
Deutsche has grappled in previous years with hefty legal costs connected to money laundering charges, among other violations, but had hoped to turn a profit in 2017.
On Friday it said the tax changes would lead to a small full-year after-tax loss.
Several large companies have announced one-time hits due to the changes to the US tax code that cut the corporate tax rate from 35% to 21%. In the long run, corporations expect to benefit from lower rates. But the switch has led many companies to revalue deferred tax assets, which are tied to deductions for past losses and can be used to reduce future tax payments.
As well as Deutsche, Morgan Stanley said it expected the changes in its deferred tax assets to lead to a $1.25bn hit.

EFL obtains ISO 14064 Certification
Leading global logistics provider, Expolanka Freight (EFL) once again set a new industry benchmark with the obtaining of ISO 14064 Certification for the second consecutive year in recognition of its outstanding efforts in recording, monitoring and reducing greenhouse gas emissions across its entire scope of operations.
EFLs ISO 14064 Certification further consolidates the companys position as a leader in the field of sustainability within the logistics sector, having been the first logistics service provider (LSP) in Sri Lanka to have obtained ISO status in 2016.
EFLs success in once again obtaining ISO 14064 Certification stands as further evidence of our firm commitment to driving sustainable business practices across the entire scope of our operations. Our certification further cements EFLs place as a true leader in sustainability, Jagath Pathirana, Chief Administration Officer Expolanka Holdings PLC said.
In total, EFL recorded GHG emissions of 7314.63 tCO2e across all its 10 operational locations across the country during the fiscal year ended March 2017.
Primary contributors to this value were Hired Vehicles, Company Owned Vehicles, and Leased Vehicles for Cargo Warehousing and Trucking Purposes, which were 72.3%, 5.5% and 2.3% of the total emissions respectively. In total, this accounts for 80.1% of the total GHG emissions of the company.
Given that our industry tends to have a larger carbon footprint that others in the service sector, we are pleased to report that EFL has continued to make progress in terms of reducing its emissions over the past year.
These efforts are reflected in a reduction of Scope 1 emissions by 73.03 tCO2e while emissions generated from purchased electricity was reduced by 192.60 tCO2e reflecting the growing contributions of our investment into solar power at the EFL campus.
Moving forward, we will endeavor to maintain and further improve on these impressive achievements, as part of an overarching strategy to encourage and foster sustainable practices such as the formulation of Carbon Management Plans and stringent carbon accounting across the entire freight and logistics sector, Jagath added.
The EFL Campus location has been successfully generating electricity using solar power since it was first established in September 2016.
Solar energy generation during the period from September 2016 to March 2017 stood at 460,256 kWh in turn enabling emissions reductions of 171.17 tCO2e during the assessment period.

Enter Digvijaya
Long before Napoleons great defeat in Waterloo, Belgium in 1815, Greek sources revealed that a great king and a conqueror was defeated in the Kingdom of India.
This great battle took place at Jhelum on the Indus River in the spring of 326 BC between King Porus and King Alexander, the great conqueror who thought he had the right to rule the entire world.
Capital Maharaja Group directorAditya Ray
Historians opined that based on his name and the location of his domain, Porus was likely to have been a descendant of the Puru tribe mentioned in the Rig Veda.
Alexanders army engaged King Poruss force of 35,000 infantrymen, 10,000 cavalry and 200 battle-trained elephants. Porus with an unusually large physique had ridden an elephant which towered above other beasts. His armour with its gold and silver inlay had lent distinction to his seven foot body.
Had Alexander emerged victories at this battle with Porus, his next destination of invasion would have been Sri Lanka. Hence King Poruss valiance centuries back in a way had contributed towards safeguarding Sri Lanka from an invasion that would have been disastrous and would have changed the course of the countrys history.
The decisive battle between the two greats is now recreated by Swastik Productions in India as a tele-series titled Digvijaya aka Victory. It is directed and produced by Sidddharth Kumar Tewary. The production that is beyond expectation of any TV audience is made to keep viewers glued to their seats. The presentation has a cinematic disposition and comprises of special effects on par with an epic cinema.Digvijaya has been shot in vivid locations in India and Thailand with five gigantic sets constructed over nine acres.
These opulent sets include the recreation of the kingdoms of
Macedonia and the Pauravas, Persia, Taxila and three huge ports. MTV group director Adithya Ray said at the premiere of Digvijaya held at NFC for the media, sponsors and MTV staff, We have read of Alexander the Great and seen him in epic films. However his victorious journe was halted at the banks of Jhelum by King Porus. Digvijaya is based on this untold and captivating story of two valiant kings who respected each other.
This digital production with vivid surroundings is the teleseries made in South Asia with the largest budget. The series had cost 80 million US dollars.Digvijaya Sinhala versions theme song is voiced by Pradeep Rangana of Pem Sihinae fame for the lyrics of Sydney Chadrasekera.
Digvijaya was premiered on Sirasa TV dubbed in Sinhala on January 6. It is scheduled to be telecast every Saturday and Sunday at 7.55 pm.

Export based economy, one of the main election pledges - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that nobody should have doubts of the Good Governance governments aim in initiating an exportbased economy. This is one of the main election pledges of the government which has taken upon the responsibility of achieving that goal.
Addressing the opening ceremony of the Rajagiriya Flyover, the Premier said that the GSP plus trade concessions had paved the way to make this goal a reality.
The export led economy will generate more job opportunities for Sri Lankan youth within the country, the Prime Minister said.
He further said under the Yahapalanaya Government massive industrialisation and development of the tourism industry, services, agriculture, and the fisheries industry are currently ongoing and infrastructure development is very much essential to make these development activities a success.
During past three years we were able to implement various infrastructure developments with a proper plan.
The previous regime had implemented various development projects without considering the importance of infrastructure development and also without enough funds to complete those projects.
We had to fulfill those needs before continuing those projects, the Premier said.
The Good Governance Government has already implemented various projects including the Kandy-Hambantota Industrial Zone, Colombo Municipality Industrial Zones, tourism zones and Moragahakanda as the last project of the Mahaweli and fisheries sector development, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.

Fireworks in Pakistan
The more you think of the 1982 Australian cricket tour of Pakistan the more you want to forget it stated Rod Marsh in his book The Inside Edge. Quite apart from the fact that the Pakis beat the pants out of us in the three tests and two one day internationals, the country itself was to the western visitor a non event, notes Marsh.
It was the American humourist Tom Lehrer, who once said: If you want a long holiday, spend the night in Adelaide. I dont know about Adelaide, it certainly applies to Pakistan, mused Marsh.
He stated that the population was almost exclusively Muslims, which meant that it was illegal for them to drink liquor. Every Australian cricket team of his experience looked forward to a beer in the dressing room, after a long hot days play, and Pakistan seemed to have, more long hot days than most countries. So beer in the dressing room was out.
Marsh pondered that it was no great loss because most of the rooms were less than luxurious quite grotty in fact and it might have been a little depressing to stick around there too long.
They were far better off than the touring teams of the 1950s and 1960s, though, because since those days the major cities like Lahore and Karachi have acquired fine modern hotels. And being VIPs thats where they stayed, noted Marsh.
They were lucky, too in being able to have supplies of Australian beer and canned fruit shipped in. That was really their staple diet. That might not sound too health promoting, but unless you care to play Pakistani roulette by living on their curries, there is little else for the tourists to eat. Now Marsh loved a good curry as well as the next man, but he never came to grips with eating it when he had a game of cricket to play next day.
He never left the field during a Test match to complete his days ablutions. He knew what a curry can do to the internal nether regions. Imagine that one of the devastating Pakistani concoctions could do to you, as you stood there behind the stumps all day. Youd make more runs than Bradman.
And none of them would count on the scoreboard.
So, Swan lager and canned Australian fruit it was. For Marsh anyway.
Some of the guys whod not toured Pakistan before were a little more adventurous and ignored warnings about sampling the culinary delights of the mystic east. They certainly kept the team doctor busy with their stomach complaints.
Even the most cautious of us tended to live with perpetual mild diarrhoea. You know that get up and go feeling. Not get up and go out and play cricket like a man possessed, but got up and went to the gents or to the ladies if he couldnt make it as far as the gents, noted Marsh.
I suppose if you were on a tour an extended tour of Pakistan and lived on beer and tinned fruit, youd come home an alcoholic with fruit fly. He figured that it would beat the ravages of gut tearing, bowel blowing curry.
But food was not really the drawback over there. It was the boredom. God, the boredom.
The average days play starts at 10 a.m. and ends about 4.30. So you have got the rest of the afternoon and all evening free. But what do you do Very little. Because there was very little you could do.
You went back to your hotel (in the bigger hotels they gave you a team room) you sat around. You just sat around.
Having been there before, Marsh made sure he packed a cassette player and lots of ammunition that time. At least they could listen to music.
They also had inhouse television movies and if anyone would like to hear Marsh recite the entire dialog of The Sting, dont hesitate to ask.
He saw the bloody thing 33 times on that tour and he knew it off by heart. I also hum the theme team so well that youd swear Id composed it. Da da da-dum da dum,da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da- da-dum. Saw
Scott Joplin, you know.
Boredom can make a man-or a touring cricket team do silly things and we found our outlet in firecrackers. Firecrackers mind you.
A few of them went shopping during a rest day in Lahore and they came to a little shop specializing in fireworks, which were pretty big in Pakistan but as you knew, a thing of the past in Australia. Frankly, he would have agreed with every campaign to outlaw them at home because he thought putting a cracker in the hand of a kid was about as sensible as letting a drunk driver take the controls of a fully laden Jumbo jet, concludes Marsh.
When one takes a brief glimpse on the current team, surprises are the order of the day. The ones in the know have now decided to have a toss-up between the every bodies darling, Angelo Mathews with fitness issues and laid back attitude to boot and the Bubbly Dinesh Chandimal, who has been nobodys darling till late. I hope sanity prevails and Chandimal malli will get to lead his mother country in the Tests and one-dayers and our friend Mr Angelo Mathews will do the honours in the T20, as we know he is a worldbeater in his own right in that format.

Ford teams up with World Vision Lanka
Ford Motor Company and its local distribution partner, Future Automobiles (Pvt) Limited, in collaboration with World Vision Sri Lanka recently launched a rainwater harvesting project in Polonnaruwa.
The project aims to establish year-round access to water for 100 beneficiaries in Welikanda, Polonnaruwa through effective rainwater harvesting replenishment systems. This project will enable the utilization of rainwater that would otherwise go to waste and instead provide year-round access to water for these communities through suitable water catchment areas.
The project is expected to meet three key objectives. Firstly, is the establishment of a Rain Water Harvesting systems (RWH) and replenishment systems for a network of 5-6 households to obtain year-round access to water. Regular maintenance of the RWH systems will be ensured via the creation of family groups, where one person from each group will be assigned to form Community Based Organization (CBOs).
Training and creating awareness on rainwater harvesting will be carried out while communities will also be introduced to renewable energy mechanisms in the form of solar-powered pumping systems.
The second objective of the project is the focus on the replenishment of groundwater through suitable well or over ground catchment area to ensure sustainability for retaining the ground water during the drought season. Thirdly, is the formation of renewable water consumer societies among the family groups and the training of operational maintenance of solar powered rainwater harvesting systems.
Today is a new chapter in our partnership with World Vision which goes back several years. The availability of water throughout the year is a vital aspect to the well-being of these communities. Given that Welikanda is an area with a harsh drought season, it is imperative that we make the best possible use of rainwater. The Rain Water Harvesting system combined with the use of renewable technologies such as solar-powered water pumping systems, will enable the community to sustainably manage their water requirement, said Chamath Tennekoon, Chief Executive Officer of Future Automobiles.
Expressing his views on the tie-up, Dhanan Senathirajah, National Director of World Vision Lanka stated, World Vision Lanka is committed to serve the most vulnerable communities in Sri Lanka. We are extremely grateful to Ford for partnering with us in our work. Last year their partnership brought clean water to over 200 families in one of the poorest communities in Vaharai. We are very excited to partner with them once again on a similar project for a vulnerable community in Welikanda.
Over the past few years, Ford has supported numerous projects and causes in Sri Lanka under the Ford Conservation and Environmental Grants program. These initiatives have helped support and reward the actions of individuals, groups and non-profit organizations to conduct research and projects which help preserve the environmental well-being of their communities and provide solutions contributing to a sustainable planet.
In 2015, Ford partnered with World Vision Lanka for a water and sanitation project in Vaharai, Batticaloa District. In 2014, as part of this initiative, Ford awarded a US$ 20,000 grant to the Field Ornithology Group of Sri Lanka (FOGSL) while in 2013 two organizations  The Tree Society of Sri Lanka and the Wanasarana Thurulatha Swechcha Society  were awarded a grant of US$15,000.
Similarly, in 2012 the Fire Prevention in Knuckles Forest Reserve project received US$10,000 to implement their proposals.

## Title: GLYPHOSATE  DESTINED TO DIE SOON
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Tuesday, January 9, 2018 - 01:00
GLYPHOSATE  DESTINED TO DIE SOON
Glyphosate is repeatedly described as the most popular herbicide ever by those who ignorantly and blindly believe in the marketing scam conducted by the manufacturers. Glyphosate is popular as judged by virtue of its unprecedented volume of sales. This popularity lies with only the profit oriented medium and large scale commercial farmers and that is due to the fact that the use of glyphosate eliminates a lot of work in weed control and time used on it. The herbicide is not expensive too. All three factors save money to profit oriented farmers for whom ethics and making a decent principled living is not a matter of concern.
However, that popularity with farmers is dying now because the use of glyphosate:
1. Is not healthy.
Many farmers and hired applicators who have sprayed glyphosate for over 20 years have developed a form of cancer called non-Hodgkins Lymphoma, a type of blood cancer. Many have died of it. Affected persons and dependants of the dead are suing Monsanto for damages.
2. Does not ensure higher yields.
The U.S. Department of Agriculture [USDA] has accepted that the yield of GMO corn (on which glyphosate is used heavily) is 54 bushels/acre compared to 56 bushels/acre for non-GMO corn. The difference is attributed to the lower mineral content caused by the strong chelating action of glyphosate on soil and plant minerals.
3. Does not ensure diminishing use of glyphosate.
Resistance by plants have resulted in the increasing use of glyphosate, in terms of frequency and quantity. Plants have developed resistance to glyphosate. These Superweeds have developed several shikimate pathways to circumvent the loss of the original natural one destroyed by glyphosate to kill the plant. They produce millions of seeds too. These plants have to be soaked individually with glyphosate to kill all the shikimate pathways they have. This is an exercise far worse than the weeding regime before the advent of glyphosate; this has to be done yearly because of new plants rising from the millions of seed; farmers cannot cope with it. What if this happens in our tea plantations Can superweeds be killed one by one How much will that cost Can it be done every year
4. Has caused abandonmentof farms.
Currently over 70 million acres of farmland in the USA are virtually abandoned due to the growth of over 23 species of superweeds. They can be removed rather quickly only by ploughing deep using heavy machinery. Many farmers who cannot afford to do it yearly have either given up farming or sold their land cheaply. Monsanto has purchased large extents of such land.
Just as much as surviving profit oriented farmers love glyphosate herbicides, informed consumers and those who have suffered health hazards due to glyphosate hate it with a much greater intensity. They are in their several millions compared to the farmers in their hundreds of thousands. In the USA, the Organic Consumers Association [OCA] has over two million activists and Moms Across America has about a million activists  to name just two. In the European Union over 1.3 million people from member nations signed a petition strongly opposing relicensing glyphosate in 2016 and 2017. In 2016 too, a survey of the EU population indicated 2/3rds of the people against relicensing.
Health hazards ofGlyphosate
The dangers from glyphosate are being exposed almost monthly now. After Monsantos research papers, and documents pertaining to cases filed against Monsanto, were released to public scrutiny in March 2015, many independent researchers, mostly in universities, have shown plenty of proof of glyphosates dangers. They are very different from Monsantos outdated and purposely misleading doctored 40 year old research. The Monsanto Papers can be accessed in the website of the prosecuting law firm Baum Hedlund Aristei Goldman PC via the link Whistle Blower Claims, Consumer Class Actions & Toxic Tort Law and the sub-link Monsanto Roundup Lawsuit.
It is said that the Food and Drug Administration [FDA] of the USA requires US Dollars 800 million to carry out a proper and comprehensive testing of a chemical like glyphosate. Such testing is so far too expensive for independent researchers, and they get no return for that expenditure as would a glyphosate manufacturer.
Court action againstcontamination of foodby Glyphosate
This is one reason why there is a dearth of independent research even now. Another is the claim of trade secrets by the manufacturer. However, that dearth is being now addressed on a wider scale, supported even by governments, because of popular unrest amongst consumers against forced consumption of food purposely contaminated with glyphosate. This opposition is far bigger than the biased or ignorant motley group that supports the use of glyphosate.
Consumers will stop buying contaminated vegetables and fruits as well as meat products made from animals raised on contaminated feed. It is happening now. Consumer organisations are fighting court cases too; there are over 1000 cases against Monsanto. Cases are being filed against the European Commission as well as its regulatory bodies the EFSA and the ECHA too.
It is a cause for sheer unbelieving wonder that there are still people who want to foist glyphosate on the Sri Lankan population. These are not ignorant uninformed people. These are educated as well as professional people like Professors, Doctorate holders and tea industry professionals. Probably in the case of the former it is a case of education is not learning and in the case of the latter it is a lack of intelligence and diligence to adapt to unavoidable situations.
Let us take the tea industry first. It is 30 months now since glyphosate was banned, but they are still crying for it. They had plenty of time to do a diligent study of the situation and adapt to it. But they still say the industry will die if they are not allowed to use glyphosate. On the contrary, they will destroy the industry for good if they continue to use glyphosate. The reason Litigation by the two million strong OCA against glyphosate traces in tea! If the OCA wins the case, and indications are that they will, tea consumption will drop like a rock not just in the U.S.A. but all over the world.
The OCA has tested a tea sold in the market for glyphosate and found traces higher than the minimum permitted level in the EU. The importer/seller is claiming that the tea is natural. The OCA is contesting that claim by arguing that;
a. No tea can be natural if it contains an unnatural substance
b. The offered tea is not natural as it contains much less minerals than natural tea  owing to the strong chelating power of glyphosate reducing mineral intake by the plant.
c. Glyphosate is not a natural product. It is a patented chelator used to remove solid mineral salt deposits inside boiler and heat exchanger tubes.
d. Glyphosate traces in tea is a health hazard for billions of tea consumers world-wide.
These arguments cannot be denied. The contest here is naturalness not the health hazards of glyphosate. However, the news is already out to the world that tea is contaminated by glyphosate. That will start a boycott in the U.S.A. that will spread to Canada, the EU and the rest of the world.
President Putin of Russia is determined to make Russia the supplier of organic food to the world. Accordingly, Genetically Modified Organisms [GMOs} are already banned in Russia; glyphosate will be banned soon enough. It will have to be banned to produce organic food. In such a scenario they will not buy our tea if it is glyphosate contaminated. Our other main buyers will follow suit. Even we will stop drinking our own tea! The tea industry will then be starved to death, throwing about two million people dependent on tea production out of their livelihoods and burdening the government with a massive stranded asset.

Hotelier calls for  aggressive marketing of  SL as tourism hot spot
Sri Lankan tourism is yet to expose the cultural and architectural wonders of ancient Sri Lanka to the world and exploit its benefits to tourism, said international award winning hotelier and Managing Director of Forest Rock Garden Resort and Palm Garden Village Hotel Anuradhapura, B. Chandrasiri.
He said that not only Sri Lankan tourism but also the Minister of Cultural Affairs has failed very badly in this area and they are only keen on collecting the entry fees from tourists. Take Taj Mahal in India and see what a lot of marketing is being done. Similarly Maldives too is into aggressive marketing campaigns and Male promotions can even be viewed on SriLankan Airlines flights.
He said that its high time that the hotels in the Cultural Triangle get together and do a joint marketing campaign to highlight Sri Lankan ancient architecture to the world. This is especially needed to woo more Chinese and Buddhist tourists.
He said that today most of the so called eco-friendly hotels dont have local architecture and they have ignored ancient Lankan building techniques and designs.
Chandrasiri who was based in Italy for over two decades said that he wanted to create a landmark in Sri Lanka tourism and decided to invest. My first project was to build Palm Garden Village Hotel Anuradhapura on a 50-acre bare land where I spent almost a year planting the property with trees before starting construction.
Five years ago, he embarked on his second hotel project, Forest Rock Garden, a living masterpiece which gives its guests the once-in-a-life time experience to go back into the golden days of the Anuradhapura Kingdom in this 21st century with utmost luxury and great sense of royalty, serenity and peace.
The hotel built on concrete pillars with the intention of not disturbing the surroundings was appreciated for its commitment to excellence by being awarded the Gold award for International Star for Leadership in Quality (ISLQ) by Spanish-based Business Initiative Directions (BID) in France. In order to ensure the continuance of the natural landscape, nearly 100,000 rare herbal plants have been planted on the premises.
In addition to other accolades, Hoteliers Association of Anuradhapura also felicitated his achievements. Minister of Tourism, John Amaratunga who was the chief guest at the event said the Forest Rock Garden Resort could be taken as an example by other entrepreneurs to build eco-friendly and spiritual, boutique type resorts instead of putting up more concrete jungles to promote the hotel industry in Sri Lanka.
He said that he was also disappointed by the delays for approval processes when there is a need to create a new product. After building the Forest Rock Garden Resort in Anuradhapura and the subsequent overwhelming response I received from both guests and travel agents, I knew that hotels highlighting ancient Sri Lankan culture were in big demand.
I planned to build my third hotel Ape Gama also in Anuradhapura with an investment of Rs. 300 million where there would be weekend Pola, tea kiosks, fisheries stall and many ancient monuments recreated in this proposed hotel.
He said that approval process is taking such a long time and he has to go to several Ministries. (SS)

From crisis to sustenance  Part 10
If the swimming pool is crowded, take a deep dive  into the blue ocean:
The continuous intense competition has become a tremendous challenge to most companies. Yet, why do some companies keep on achieving sustained high growth in both revenues and profits
The research studies done reveal that the answer lay in the way those companies approach marketing strategy. The difference in approach is not a matter of managers choosing one analytical tool or planning model over another. The difference is in the companies fundamental, clear assumptions about their marketing strategy.
The less successful companies take a conventional approach: they focus on matching and beating their rivals. As a result, their marketing strategies incline towards on similar dimensions. What ensues is head-to-head competition based largely on incremental improvements in cost, quality, or both.
Accor Group
The innovative companies break free from the pack by staking out fundamentally new market space - that is, by creating products or services for which there are no direct competitors. We call this strategic logic as value innovation. These companies pay only little attention to matching or beating their rivals.
One good example is the French Accor group.It is the story of two friends, Paul Dubrule and Gerard Pelisson, who opened their first budget hotel in 1967 at a time when no one in France yet believed in this new hotel business model. Today, the operate and franchise 4,200 hotels in 95 countries, from budget and economy lodgings to five-star hotels.They target opening 50 hotels per year. Their last years revenue was 5,631 M.
The secret of their tremendous success was their belief in the concept of value innovation.
The motto of Accor was challenging: transform, innovate,overturn traditional hospitality industry conventions.As Paul once said, When the swimming pool is overcrowded, jump into the blue ocean.
In early seventies, Paul and Gerard began by identifying what customers of all budget hotels whether no star, one star, and two stars really wanted. They summed their findings in one simple sentence. A typical budget hotel client expects a peaceful nights sleep in comfortable atmosphere for a low price.
Focusing on that particular need, Paul and Gerard saw an opportunity in front of them. They asked themselves the following four questions. Which of the factors that our industry takes for granted should be eliminated Which factors should be reduced well below the industrys standard Which factors should be raised well above the industrys standard Which factors should be created that the industry has never offered
The first question forced both of them to consider whether the factors that companies compete on actually deliver value to consumers. Often those factors are taken for granted, even though they have no value or even detract from value. Sometimes what buyers value changes fundamentally, but companies that are focused on benchmarking one another do not act on - or even perceive - the change.
The second question forced both of them to determine whether products and services have been overdesigned in the race to match and beat the competition. The third question pushedthem to uncover and eliminate the compromises their industry forces customers to make. The fourth question helped them break out of the industrys established boundaries to discover entirely new sources of value for consumers.
Ibis
In answering these questions, Accor came up with a new concept for a hotel, which led to the launch of Accor Ibis brand of budget hotels. First, the company eliminated such standard hotel features as costly restaurants and appealing lounges. Accor reckoned that even though it might lose some customers, most people would do without those features.
So, Ibis gives the customers comfy beds, cocoon-style rooms, 24/7 access, free Wi-Fi, wide choice of TV channels and a breakfast in a buffet at an affordable price. The cost savings have allowed Ibis to improve the features customers value most to levels beyond those of the average two-star hotel, but the price is only marginally above that of one-star hotels.
Customers have rewarded Ibis for its value innovation. The company has not only captured the mass of budget hotel customers but also expanded the market. From salesmen who previously stayed in crowded hostels to businesspeople needing a few hours of rest, new customers have been drawn to the Ibis category.
Jo&Joe
In May last year, Accor Hotels launched another revolutionary hotel concept called JO&JOE. It represented a whole new hospitality brand. JO&JOE has been conceived above all as an open house welcoming anyone to share experiences and meet in a blended environment.
The entire infrastructure of the hotel was built around an open house concept. The bar serves as the houses heart, a unique, social place where everyone is welcome. Hotel guests will have the possibility to cook in a shared kitchen or enjoy the local cuisine at a very decent price.
Designed so that everyone retains their privacy, the sleeping accommodation offers different solutions to suit all needs: Together (a shared sleeping area for 7 to 12 people), Out of the Ordinary, (uniquely laid out accommodation for up to 10 people) and Yours (private rooms for 2 to 5 people).
Nowadays, young adults are keen on using sharing economy platforms because of their convenience, accessibility and novelty. Accor Hotels believed that the hospitality industry must break authenticity, and challenge its existing barriers. They did it and found out the response was very much beyond what was predicted.
Value Curve
The extent of Accors departure from the standard thinking of its industry can be seen in what we call a value curve - a graphic depiction of a companys relative performance across its industrys key success factors. According to the conventional logic of competition, an industrys value curve follows one basic shape. Rivals try to improve value by offering a little more for a little less, but most dont challenge the shape of the curve.
Accor Hotels discarded the notion of what a hotel is supposed to look like in order to offer what most customers want: a good nights sleep at a low price.
However, other than Ibis and Jo&Joe, Accor Hotels offer a large brand portfolio in the hotel industry comprising luxury and upscale brands as well as popular midscale & economy brands and in-demand lifestyle smart concepts.
Instead swimming in the crowded pool, Accor had dived into the blue ocean
Conventional Logic Versus Value Innovation
Conventional strategic logic and the logic of value innovation differ along the four basic dimensions of strategy.
Industry Assumptions
Many companies take their industry conditions as given and set strategy accordingly. Smart entrepreneurs dont. No matter how the rest of the industry is faring, they look out for blockbuster ideas and quantum leaps in value.
Had Accor, for example, taken its industrys conditions as given, it would never have created Ibis or a Jo&Joe. The company would have followed the end-game strategy of milking its business or the zero-sum strategy of competing for share in a shrinking market.
Customers
Most companies seek growth through retaining and expanding their customer bases. This often leads to finer segmentation and greater customization of offerings to meet specialized needs. Value innovation follows a different logic. Instead of focusing on the differences between customers, they build on the powerful commonalities in the features that customers value.
In the words of a senior executive at the hotelier Accor, We focus on what unites customers. Customers differences often prevent you from seeing whats most important. Value innovators believe that most people will put their differences aside if they are offered a considerable increase in value. Those companies shoot for the core of the market, even if it means losing some of their customers.
Assets and capabilities
Many companies view business opportunities through the lens of their existing assets and capabilities. They ask, Given what we have, what is the best we can do In contrast, value innovators ask, What if we start anew
This is not to say that value innovators never leverage their existing assets and capabilities; they often do. But, more important, they assess business opportunities without being biased or constrained by where they are at a given moment. For that reason, value innovators not only have more insight into where value for buyers resides - and how it is changing - but also are much more likely to act on that insight.
Creating a new value curve
How does the logic of value innovation translate into a companys offerings in the marketplace Consider the case of Accor.
Conventional logic leads companies to compete at the margin for incremental share. The logic of value innovation starts with an ambition to dominate the market by offering a tremendous leap in value. Value innovators never say, Look, heres what competitors are doing; lets do this in response.
Of course, they monitor competitors but do not use them as benchmarks. value innovators philosophy is simple: We are not interested in whether we are better than the competition. The real test for us is, will most buyers still seek out our products even if we dont market them
Since value innovators dont focus on competing, they can distinguish the factors that deliver superior value from all the factors the industry competes on. They do not expend their resources to offer certain product and service features just because that is what their rivals are doing.
Like Accor, all the high-performing companies create fundamentally new and superior value curves. They achieve that through a combination of eliminating unnecessary features, creating new features, and reducing and raising features to levels unprecedented in their industries.

Japan investors bet big on Bitcoin
Known as Miss Bitcoin on Japanese social media, Mai Fujimoto says she invests all of her savings in the virtual currency that has proved a huge hit in Japan.
I convert all my disposable income into cryptocurrency, the 32-year-old tells AFP. Ive been doing this for nearly a year now. I convert all my savings into cryptocurrency instead of putting them in a bank.
She is not alone in her enthusiasm. Bitcoin is recognised as legal tender in the worlds third-biggest economy and nearly one-third of global bitcoin transactions in December were denominated in yen, according to specialised website jpbitcoin.com.
This has led to many analysts speculating that the famous Mrs Watanabeshorthand for Japanese individual foreign exchange investors is behind the recent volatile frenzy that pushed the price of bitcoin up to nearly $20,000 before dropping back.
Firstly, unlike regional rivals China and South Korea, whose regulators have clamped down hard on the cryptocurrency, Japan has welcomed it with open arms.
In April, Japan passed a law recognising bitcoin and other virtual currencies as legal tender while also stressing the need for transparency and financial stability.
Some well-known Japanese businesses have started accepting payment in bitcoin and one firm made waves when it said it would pay part of its employees salaries in the currency if they wish.
The involvement of big companies, the sense of security derived from government approval and media exposure really brought in a whole new group of people to the market, said Koji Higashi, a wellknown commentator on the cryptobusiness in Japan.
Another factor contributing to a bitcoin boom in Japan: ultra-low interest rates from the deflation-battling central bank that has left investors scratching their heads for places to find returns on their cash.
While Japanese are generally considered risk-averse investors, they are also well-versed in the complexities of market trading, especially in foreign exchange.
Whatever the reason, Miss Bitcoin has been a convert since 2012.
At the time, I was working with children and creating an online donation platform. And for the first time, I learned how expensive it is to send money abroad, Fujimoto recalled.
So, I was really impressed when I heard that I dont have to go through banks if I use bitcoin payment, added the businesswoman.
She snapped up her first bitcoin for 1,200 yen ($10) in 2012. On Sunday it was trading at $16,726.

Lasantha revolutionised journalistic landscape
The last regime was defeated on the backs of those committed journalists who laid down their lives when even those in Parliament were quivering before a marauding group in control of every sphere of human activity in our land, Lal Wickrematunge, brother of slain editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, said in a statement on the ninth death anniversary of the editor .
Justice need be done not as a favour. Justice need be done to prevent a repetition, he said.
He said failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge could even open the door to the prime suspect or suspects to be elected the President or the Prime Minister of our land at a future date.
The full statement:
Nine years have passed since Lasantha was done to death in the most dastardly fashion. Nine years have passed and justice has not been done. Murder, not restricted to Lasantha but of other journalists, was carried out with impunity at a time when apathy reigned amongst the people.
At present, there is a sense of hopelessness at the manner the present administration is handling investigations. Should political authorities be guiding murder investigations, one may ask. Some may argue that it is the duty to do so since the very same murders have been used to garner votes at election time. Presently, the murders are used to remind people of how brutal a regime was when they occurred. But what about bringing the perpetrators to book
Many such investigations are all but concluded. The need is to arrest the suspects and charge them for murder. Letting time pass by till it is convenient may turn out to be counterproductive, as history has evidenced. The last regime was defeated on the backs of those committed journalists who lay down their lives when even those in Parliament were quivering before a marauding group in control of every sphere of human activity in our land. Justice need be done not as a favour. Justice need be done to prevent a repetition. Else, they would have died not for the people but for a chosen few to replace the defeated.
Murder, when it is committed by criminals outside of politics, is investigated in haste and convictions obtained in a couple of years. Failure to bring to justice those responsible for the murder of Lasantha could even open the door to the prime suspect or suspects to be elected the President or Prime Minister of our land at a future date. Who knows
We remember Lasantha, who revolutionised the journalistic landscape of Sri Lanka at a time when none dared. He was brave, committed and resolute in his task to eradicate corruption within the halls of government. If the authorities cannot bring justice, let us commit ourselves to perpetuate his name amongst the people on whose behalf he lay down his life.
Lasantha was honoured posthumously by many a prestigious overseas organisation. But that is to be understood. Honour is rarely bestowed outside a singular profession, in Sri Lanka. I thank all of you who have come each year to pray for the repose of Lasanthas soul. Let us pray for him.

Long-term solution to Rajagiriya traffic congestion
President Maithripala Sirisena vested the Rajagiriya flyover with the public yesterday, providing a long-term solution to the heavy traffic congestion in the Rajagiriya area.
Even though the construction work of the flyover was scheduled to be completed by the end of this year, steps were taken under the guidance of the President to complete the construction work 11 months ahead of schedule for the convenience of the public.
The construction work of the flyover commenced in 2016, jointly by a Spanish company and a local company. It was built at a cost of Rs. 4,700 million.
The length of the flyover is 533 metres and the width, 21.4 metres, and consists of a total of four lanes - two lanes each way.
In parallel to this project, several roads around the Rajagiriya area will be developed and an alternative road towards Narahenpita will be developed.
The road towards Buthgamuwa will be developed with a total of three lanes, according to the Highways Ministry.
The flyover was built using high standard modern technology as well as in accordance with high quality engineering.
This will add to our roadways history as the first flyover constructed by filling concrete surfaces on metal.
During the times of heavy traffic congestion in Rajagiriya, the speed of vehicles moving on this road is slower than 2 kilometres per hour. With the opening of the flyover, the speed limit of vehicles will increase by eight-fold.

Metta, pillar of the Maithri Presidency
Did Maithripala Sirisena disappoint the 6.2 million voters by letting MRcontest Parliamentary elections in August 2015 under the SLFP tag Somecalled it a great betrayal; while others thought it a emocratic option orburying the hatchet for mutual survival. The stakeholders of the great silent revolution of January 8; Civil society men, politicians, clergy and manyindependent groups who teamed up with a section of SLFP were expectingsomeone who believed in the famous Buddha word the verse No. 5in Dhammapada, Nahiverena VeraniSammanti dha Kudacancam
President Sirisena though born in Gampaha in the Western Province hails from Polonnaruwa in the North Central Province and is the first Head of State from that province. He who does not belong to the Sri Lankan political elite is an agriculturist.
Joining the mainstream politics in 1989 as a member of the Parliament he has held several ministerial portfolios since 1994. The General Secretary of the SLFP, he was Health Minister until November 2014 when he made that bold and surprise move announcing his candidacy for the 2015 presidency as the oppositions common candidate. His victory too was generally viewed as a surprise. The 6.2 million votes were more anti-Rajapaksa than pro-Sirisena. Maithripala Sirisena pledged to reinforce Sri Lanka's judiciary and parliament, to battle with corruption and to investigate war crimes allegations without involving foreign judicial mechanism, repeal the notorious Eighteenth Amendment, bring back the Seventeenth Amendment and appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe, the UNP leader as Prime Minister.
At 6.20 p.m. on January 9, 2015, the 63-year-old farmer-turned-politician Maithripala Sirisena was sworn in as the sixth Executive President before a Supreme Court judge in Independence Square, Colombo. After being sworn in, Sirisena, unlike his predecessors, he pledged to voluntarily transfer significant presidential powers to Parliament.
The cultured mans thinking he amply demonstrated twice within the first year itself as President; first when, in 2015, he not only criticised but called for the organisers of an Enrique Iglesias show in Colombo to be whipped. Commenting on the behaviour of a female fan he said, I don't advocate that these uncivilised women who removed their brassieres should be beaten with toxic stingray tails, but those who organised such an event should be.
Democratic option
The simple straightforward character, he requested the media and the people of Sri Lanka not to use His Excellency title although legally he was entitled to use the style, and also advised to avoid using the word First Lady for his wife, and requested only to use President's wife
Did Maithripala Sirisena disappoint the 6.2 million voters by letting MR contest Parliamentary elections in August 2015 under the SLFP tag Some called it a great betrayal; while others thought it a democratic option or burying the hatchet for mutual survival. The stakeholders of the great silent revolution of January 8; Civil society men, politicians, clergy and many independent groups who teamed up with a section of SLFP were expecting someone who believed in the famous Buddha word the verse No. 5 in Dhammapada, Nahiverena VeraniSammanti dha Kudacancam: [Hatred never ceases through hatred, but through love alone they cease] which he stated on the day he proclaimed his entry to the fray and repeated almost immediately after taking oaths to deprive Mahinda Rajapaksa of nominations to contest the scheduled Parliamentary elections.
The anti-Rajapaksa groups prompted vindictive response from the compassionate man reminding him of his fate, six feet under, if his bte noire won on January 8, which he ignored while nominating his former boss to contest and lead the party at the Parliamentary Elections in mid-2015. He was targeted by the same group of people who supported him a few months before. All media, print and electronic -turned their wrath towards him. He was criticised and castigated a traitor for a couple of weeks by the very people who laboured to crown him as the all-powerful Executive. In his own words, They even put extra pressure on the pen, when writing the word traitor to scorn me.
Making factual and authentic comments against the FCID, CID and the Bribery Commission, President Maithripala Sirisena once stated that certain persons, who had no understanding or capability to think on how to run the State, security, management of Defence Forces and administration make erroneous moves.
Leader of the SLFP
He showed what kind of a person he is when senior Minister and veteran politician, A.H.M. Fowzie, who has an unblemished record, was charged for using temporarily a car he used at his former office until he was given an official vehicle, while those who ransacked public property go scot free.
This incidence undermined Sirisena in his position as the leader of the SLFP and created a perception among the public that the three institutions are working to destabilise the President.
I have stated clearly at a meeting with the Prime Minister and the Cabinet, that I will be forced to make certain hard decisions if the Bribery Commission, CID, FCID are functioning to please the political agendas of interested parties, he said.
The President made this observation at the Sathviru Sanhinda organised by the Defence Ministry held at S L Foundation Institute. In another instance, during the latter part of last year, FCID summoned Vasantha Karannagoda, the naval officer who commanded the destruction of two LTTE vessels carrying a cache of arms long before the final thrust on the opponent and was also the Commander of Navy during the height of the final phase of the war. To be fair by the President, he even then reminded establishment on his role as the Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces, and that they must keep him informed every time such questioning demanded.
Questioning of Former Defence Secretary and Navy Commanders over the infamous floating armoury Avant Garde took place weeks ago but they were called upon before courts only a week ago. President strongly expressed his annoyance over, taking before the court, the four war heroes; he said:
Independent Commissions were set up with a purpose and policy. Commissioners serving in them ought to know the functions relevant to them. There is an accepted procedure, as the President as well as the Minister of Defence, I need to know in advance. As per the Constitution, only the Executive has the power to appoint Secretaries and Directors-General.
Numerous public officers had been brought to the FCID for questioning, a procedure that had generated a great deal of bitterness among government employees. When they tapped the telephone of SC Judge Gooneratne, who cleared Duminda Silva of the murder charges, the President appointed a committee to examine and report on the incident.
I will not be submissive or under obligation to anybody. As the President I am bound to ensure the national security, to protect the tri-forces, give necessary facilities to them and protect their honour. The President said that he would by no means allow the weakening of the Defence Forces: If the intelligence officers now in remand custody have allegedly committed any offense they should be tried in courts, after getting them released on bail. If not ensure their early release. The suspects have their Fundamental Rights to secure bail and get their case be heard before the courts of law, the President observed.
The President further stressed that he does not wish these establishments to be politicised.
May divine providence enable President Maithripala Sirisena to serve the full term of his Presidency.

With Trump exclaiming to North Koreas Kim Jong-un that his nuclear button is bigger than Kims, its been rumoured this has let loose a whole bunch of exaggerated comparisons, which till nows been kept under secret wraps, with the mine is bigger than yours syndrome only appearing when men start looking at each other a little too closely for comfort!
My democracy is bigger than yours! shouted the Statue of Liberty across the ocean at the Gateway of India. Maybe, sniggered the Gateway back, but my British made arches are bigger than your French designed curves!
And from Sri Lankas capital, a general shouted, Our war was a bigger victory than most others!
But our Cold War created a bigger much ado about nothing tension worldwide! tweeted the now bosom pal administrations of Trump and Putin.
And with these furious comparisons going global it was decided to have a Mine Is Bigger than Yours international pageant, something like your beauty queens have every year, but rightly, this event, only for men!
What are you going to show our prime minister has, that is bigger than others asked a member of the press to the Indian prime ministers assistant, Will you be sending his Fifty-Six inch chest records for the competition He boasted to the nation about that, didnt he
Sadly, we cant! said his personal assistant, We measured it and found it was twenty inches short! They verify these things at the pageant!
Then what else asked the press.
His ego! smiled his assistant, Its bigger than anybody elses in the world!
Yeah, like anybodys smarter than me! tweeted the American president, and if they think they are well be stopping aid or grants or visas to them all! And the Indians hastily removed any thought of entering their leaders ego into the fray, though they knew he could have won hands down.
Virat Kohlis prowess is bigger than any cricketer in the world, said a selector as he sat at a meeting of the International board at Lords.
But, these eese what heese wife say about hees first night after the wedding! said a South African board member showing a picture of the cricketer in his hotel and the selector withdrew Virats name quickly.
The judges at the International Pageant scratched their heads and appeared a worried lot, Looks like a one-sided competition! they exclaimed, Isnt there someone with something bigger than Trump!
Fire and Fury! shouted the author of the book thats set the White House on fire, entering his book into the competition. Not fair! tweeted Trump as the world watched Donald shrinking, Not fair! he softly squealed then went silent as the judges and pageant organizers went home with no one else to judge. Not even Kim Jong whod accidentally pressed his button and crashed his missile into his own country..!

A mission unswayed through four decades - Part 2
We hadnt the foggiest notion on how to get the money, J.R. informed De Silva and Wriggins in 1979. But the government under J.R., despite much
scepticism had managed to inspire everyone around it and they were determined to get it done,added de Silva and Wriggins
Finding the money
The matter of finding funding for the project fell squarely on the shoulders of Dissanayake who was 35 at the time, he had barely seven years of political experience and never had held a cabinet portfolio before.
De Silva and Wriggins in their political biography on J.R. noted that Dissanayake invited all ambassadors and local heads of aid missions in Colombo for detailed discussions. The most positive came from the British High Commissioner, David Aires and the most negative from the US and Japan. The US had stated that on principle they had stopped supporting dam works and the Japanese Ambassador Ochi did not believe that the headworks would be completed on time. They vaguely promised to help with the downstream work if the headworks were complete on time. Funding thus was the biggest obstacle to the project.
We hadnt the foggiest notion on how to get the money, J.R. informed De Silva and Wriggins in 1979. But the government under J.R., despite much scepticism had managed to inspire everyone around it and they were determined to get it done, added de Silva and Wriggins.
The World Bank however was reluctant to support the project which they perceived as futile and impossible to do. By mid 1978, the government was very worried whether the World Bank would support the project and it was then that Dissanayake proposed that he be allowed to embark on a visit to all potential donors so that he could make a personal appeal to them.
This extraordinary diplomatic mission was so successful that by the end of it, Britain had agreed to build Victoria, Kotmale would be done by Sweden, Randenigala/Rantambe by the Germans and Maduru Oya by the Canadians. Thus the Mahaweli programme began with rapid progress from 1978 onwards and was complete in record time. J R Jayawardena declared open all the projects undertaken during his presidency though minor works continued into the 90s.
Massive expansion
CECB, General Manager, K.L.S. Sahabandu recalled that J.R. and Dissanayake selected the CECB to handle the headworks of the projects whilst downstream activities were given to the Mahaweli Development Board (MDB).
Dr A.N.S. Kulasinghe was chosen to lead the CECB they were asked to get involved in Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala, Rantambe and Maduru Oya.
At the time we increased the department from eight or ten engineers to over 100, said Sahabandu. Complete batches of engineers from the University of Peradeniya and Moratuwa were hired to the CECB and MDB.
Earlier civil engineers did not have much demand in the country, but with the Mahaweli there was a great demand for civil engineers. In my batch, everyone wanted to be a civil engineer, but then there was some pressure and they convinced at least 10 percent to pursue other fields of engineering, said Sahabandu.
Sahabandu joined the CECB in 1980 and was sent to work in Bowatenne,
When I got there, there was no room for me to stay. I had to occupy a temporary room and a camp bed. I spent one year there and later transferred to Randenigala. There were two quarters built by the Irrigation Department during D. S.s time and we stayed there. Water was a big problem, we had to get it from the Minipe canal and in the monsoons, it all turned brown. I was also infected with Malaria twice during the construction phase, he recalled.
Later however, as the foreign consultants and engineers came in, living conditions vastly improved for all, We had to give them accommodation which met international standards, and so nice houses were built, tennis courts, swimming pools, supermarkets, clubhouses, an international school in Digana - whole enclaves came up around these dams, said Wickremaratne.
Through an engineering perspective, the combination of the foreign consultants and engineers with local engineers allowed many in Sri Lanka to learn and perfect their art, But today that doesnt happen. Everything is given to a foreign consultant and contractor but they dont have much knowledge but large amounts of foreign exchange goes out of the country for them. Their cost estimations are quite high and our people are not properly trained. And even when trained, because of the dissatisfaction they want to leave the country. This was not so during the Mahaweli, noted Sahabandu.
Moragahakanda
The Accelerated Mahaweli program had to prioritize the Mahaweli projects planned in the Master Plan in order to be able to finish in time. Thus Moragahakanda, the fifth and last of the major reservoirs was not taken up in the accelerated phase, The initial design was huge, not the same as what we have built now and when it was analysed at the time, there was not much power there. So returns were not great, said Sahabandu.
There were three studies undertaken for Moragahakanda alone. First was in 1979, other in 1989, and the next was in 1999. We used to call it the 10 year cycle. People take it up, then issue of funds come up and then they abandon it. It was a big reservoir and it was not a priority, explained Wickremaratne.
In 1999, incumbent President Maithripala Sirisena took it up (he was the deputy minister of Irrigation) and was instrumental in putting the CECB into the project team, he added. The study was funded by the Kuwaiti government and a German company came in to undertake it but then the issue of funds limited its implementation.
Then we thought that we would do what we can, so the government did some smaller sections with the funds available, said Wickremaratne further.
The project then was commenced in 2007 (when the President was Minister of Mahaweli) and was expected to be completed in 2012 but after some time, it was abandoned due to a lack of interest by the government of that time. The project was estimated to cost Rs 100 billion at the time.
Finally however, the Chinese stepped in to finish the project this year.
Moragahakandas importance lies in its potential to stabilize the irrigation system of the Mahaweli,
The availability of water in a river varies over the year but we were only using a small structure to divert  it cannot hold much water. So whatever water that comes to Polgolla, Bowatenne, has to be stored somewhere. But thus far we have had our storages in the most downstream of places, like Rajanganaya and Kala Wewa - very far. By that time, the water has evaporated and lessened. But when you have a tank closer to the source, you have the option to decide what to do with it and how much to send downstream. Moragahakanda allows us to take those decisions, explained Wickremaratne.
Moragahakanda which will supply 25MW to the grid will provide irrigation water to about 87,000 farmers in the Matale, Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Trincomalee districts, during both, the Yala and Maha seasons.
The project will irrigate 82,000 hectares of existing dry land and another 5,000 hectares of new land. Annual inland fishing will rise by another 4,500 metric tons. The project will also feed the Iranamadu Jaffna-Kilinochchi Water Supply scheme to provide drinking water to 300,000 people in Jaffna and 50,000 people in Kilinochchi.
The Settlements
One of the biggest challenges of the Mahaweli project was that of evacuation and resettlement. A total of 144,000 families were resettled in the Mahaweli system. This was mainly due to a number of villages being inundated by the reservoirs of Kotmale and Victoria.
A survey conducted in 1979 revealed that a total of 590 ha of paddy lands and 1560 ha of upcountry highlands were inundated by Kotmale (displacing 3200 families) and a total of 1250 ha and 850 ha of rich fruits and cocoa and other mixed crops were destroyed by Victoria (displacing 8000 families).
These farmer families from the upcountry thus were resettled in the dry zone, an area completely alien to them. In the early days, they also had to contend with not having drinking water, houses, roads and hospitals. In addition, farmer families took time to adapt to the new, harsher environments with many falling victim to wild animal attacks or malaria.
One of the main criticisms levelled at the Mahaweli resettlements was that it was colonizing many Tamil lands with Sinhalese settlements, especially through the Maduru Oya scheme. Ladduwahetty recalled that the then Director General and Chairman of the Mahaweli Development Authority, N.G.P. Panditaratna was accused of using the project for such purposes, But it is a difficult question to answer whether the government as a whole did that intentionally, he said.
Displaced farmer families however received 0.2 hectare of home garden land and 1 hectare of irrigated land.
We had huge implementation challenges in mobilizing thousands of people, construction, evacuation and resettlement. It was very complex and people had to be looked after in the early days very closely. The right kind of seed, planting material had to be distributed. The channels which exist in an established area does not exist in new areas. So the bureaucracy had to step in often, recalled Senior Economist at the Ministry of Plantation Industries at the time, Dr Anura Ekanayake.
Looking back at the cost-benefit analysis of the project, Dr Ekanayake noted that the project all in all had saved the country from major economic crisis, Today the Mahaweli contributes, depending on rainfall between 20-25 percent of the total national electricity requirement and 25 percent of rice output of the country. You can imagine the plight we would be in without it, he said.
When the government decided to accelerate the project, the Sri Lankan economy was virtually at a standstill, one million people unemployed, so the government liberalized the economy and started the Mahaweli project. It is hard to say we shouldnt have done it, because if we didnt we should have had other alternatives for the energy and food deficits, added Dr Ekanayake.
The downsides he noted however were in; environmental damage, deforestation and the human-elephant conflict.
It was a period of intensive studies going parallel with project implementation. They could not be done sequential, because it would have taken time. Many of the irrigation and cropping trials were tried out in parallel. They were also closely monitored to see if farmers were doing it. Some things were not hundred percent translated, but done to a great extent, he explained further.
Agriculture
Over 160,000 hectares of agricultural land came under the Mahaweli over the years and it helped the country reach self-sufficiency in rice (rice paddy production rose from about 450,000 tons in 1953 to 3.13 million tons in 2007 (FAO 2009)), until 2015; the year the present drought took over. Dr Ekanayake who is a member of the Presidential Expert Committee on Sustainable Sri Lanka 2030 Vision, observed that the one problem the Mahaweli never managed to do was to change water consumption behaviour of farmers in the country.
We wanted farmers to grow rice in the wet season (Maha) and other crops in Yala. The latter needed intensive labour and was harder to do but profits were larger, and this would have ensured a better use of water overall  but this never happened, said Dr Ekanayake.
The main reasons for this was; inability to change ingrained habits of growing rice and not wanting to shift to better water use strategies.
We irrigated all these lands but now we have to use the water more efficiently - this is the future. We are using more than double the amount of water we thought we would be using per unit of land, when we initially planned it, he noted.
With global studies on climate change suggesting that the dry zone would simply get drier and the wet zone, wetter in Sri Lanka, Dr Ekanayake stressed for a radical change in the way farmers practiced agriculture. Better water use thus would have helped us sustain agriculture even during prolonged droughts such as these.
The Mahaweli areas over the years have also had other external factors limiting its farmers from reaching their full potential. Whilst farmer incomes grew initially, they have done as well as expected mainly due to a lack of rural value chains, said Dr Ekanayake.
For decades we made the mistake of having government authorities go and purchase products and give good terms. This never works because bureaucrats are not business people and are not market savvy. We need to open it up to the private sector to build those value chains, so farmers get better terms than what they now get, he said.
Social factors such as few youth wanting to stay in farms and incomes not being sufficient to sustain them has also led to lower agricultural productivity in the Mahaweli.
Rural communities are conservative and tradition bound, it is not easy to change their ways. But we have also gone and locked them into certain situations. For example, labour shortage in the absence of other solutions, makes them prefer rice which uses less labour - other crops at times use 10 times the labour, he said.
This is an unfinished journey and now it is about opportunity cost, noted Dr Ekanayake and explained we needed to implement strategies to best utilize the resources the Mahaweli project brought in.
These things, you cannot finish, there is always an extension, echoed Ladduwahetty further, when asked what he thought of his scheme, 40 years later.

Nadal, Djokovic to test injuries at Kooyong
Melbourne, Monday: Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic will use the Kooyong Classic starting Tuesday as a convenient emergency stop to gain much-needed match practice as the pair return from injury in time for the Australian Open.
Not since the glory days of Andre Agassi and Pete Sampras nearly two decades ago and more recently Roger Federer, has the long-time exhibition event hosted as distinguished a field.
The upcoming edition will feature five of the world's top 10, including ATP Finals runner-up and two-time Kooyong champion David Goffin, Austrian Dominic Thiem, Croat Marin Cilic and Spain's Pablo Carreno Busta.
Under the ad-hoc rules, late additions Nadal and Djokovic will be playing practice matches.
World number one Nadal, who missed the warm-up Brisbane International last week with a knee injury, is set for just one appearance on Tuesday when he faces France's Richard Gasquet.
Djokovic, who hasn't played competitively since a right elbow problem forced him to quit Wimbledon in the quarter-finals in July, is due on court on Wednesday to play Thiem.
"The addition of both Novak and Rafa changes our schedule and the way we will run the four days but that's what Kooyong is all about, we are here to help the players get ready for the Open," said tournament director Peter Johnston.
The women's draw, now into a second season after being introduced in 2017, includes new Hopman Cup champion Belinda Bencic of Switzerland, German Andrea Petkovic, Aussie teen Destanee Aiava and young Chinese star Wang Xinyu.
Pat Cash, the 1987 Australian Open winner who now coaches American CoCo Vandeweghe, serves as official ambassador for the event and said it would be good preparation for Djokovic and Nadal.
"Everyone will be watching Rafa's legs and Novak's arm," he said. "It can make for a very exciting week of tennis.
Both guys had good preparation, they just suffered setbacks.
But when those come within a couple of weeks from the Australian Open, it's a bit of a worry. "They have to be absolutely ready, players can be quite anxious about it all."
The first day of play features four matches, with Nadal against Gasquet, Goffin facing Carreno Busta and wayward Australian Bernard Tomic taking on Japan's Yoshihito Nishioka.
Among the women, young Australian Aiava plays Petkovic. AFP

North and South Korea begin high-level talks on Olympic Games
North and South Korea have begun high-level talks, the first between the countries in two years.
The meeting, at the Peace House in the truce village of Panmunjom, will focus on North Korea's possible participation in the 2018 Winter Olympic Games, taking place in South Korea in February.
South Korea also said it would raise ways to improve inter-Korean relations.
Ties have become increasingly tense since the last talks in 2015.
Relations broke down after Seoul suspended a joint economic project at the Kaesong Industrial complex in North Korea following a rocket launch and nuclear test by the North.
The incident led to North Korea ending all communication with Seoul, including cutting off telephone lines. Tensions have risen in the years since as the North continues to rapidly advance its banned weapons programme.
Peace Olympics
Both sides have sent a five-member delegations to the talks, who spoke to media ahead of the session.
Seoul's Unification Minister Cho Myoung-gyon, who is leading the delegation, said the Pyeongchang Games would "become a peace Olympics as most valuable guests from the North are going to join many others from all around the world".
"The people have a strong desire to see the North and South move toward peace and reconciliation," Cho added.
The South has labelled the upcoming Winter Games the "peace Olympics" with President Moon Jae-in saying it a "groundbreaking chance" to improve relations between the Koreas.
The North's delegation is led by Ri Son-gwon, the chairman of North Korea's state agency in charge of affairs with the South and a veteran negotiator.
"We came to this meeting today with the thought of giving our brethren, who have high hopes for this dialogue, invaluable results as the first present of the year," said Ri at the start of the talks.
His South Korean counterpart also similarly expressed optimism.
"Our talks began after North and South Korea were severed for a long time, but I believe the first step is half the trip," said Cho.
North Korean leadership expert Michael Madden told the BBC that we were seeing the "baby steps of incremental rapprochement".
"Both Koreas are proceeding cautiously, but what they would like to see happen is [the meeting] becoming a springboard for further contacts and interactions," Madden said.
The delegates are meeting in Panmunjom village that lies in the heavily guarded demilitarised zone (DMZ) and is where the two sides have historically held talks.
What is the significance of Panmunjom
After the Korean war ended in a truce in 1953, Panmunjom was designated as the one place where officials from both sides could meet.
The "truce village" is divided into two parts by a military demarcation line: one side belonging to the North, the other to the South.
In the middle of the village sit the UN Command buildings, crossing the middle of the line.
Last year, a North Korean defector made a dash through the DMZ, managing to cross over to the South Korean side of Panmunjom.
'Great thing for all humanity'
The high-level talks were agreed after North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said he was considering sending a team to the Olympics in Pyeongchang in his New Year address.
The move led to North Korea restoring a telephone hotline to South Korea, enabling the first contact about holding talks.
US President Donald Trump called the talks a "big start", adding that it would be a "great thing for all of humanity" if they resulted in a positive outcome.

Of parodies, carols and barrels of seasonal cheer!
I thought I had survived the frenzied seasonal stampede and made it through to Christmas Day and the New Year with my decrepit body and sanity intact. Yes, I have endured running the gauntlet of the loud noisy malls with thousands of people trying to maul one another. Thats why they are called mauls by the more timid shoppers.
Now if Christmas was anything like last year I must be half awake. The carols heralding the midnight service actually sounded almost as seraphic as those sung by Hark and Harold and their angelic choir. I thought that even by Boxing Day I would be at least given a respite from the holiday music. Fat hope!
I regret now how I recalled the schoolboy antics of my good friend and former classmate Bonnie Boyd to the grandkids. They thought he was a hilarious lyrical genius. Worse still, they thought he was an icon to be followed as an example. Yes, I am referring to the same Boyd whose full-throated bell-like contralto drowned the rest of the songbirds in the primary school choir. He was not actually a nightingale, but nonetheless he always had his mates in gales of laughter with his naughty song parodies.
Whenever the hymns were being sung he would substitute words such as Allapang-Loolla for Alleluia or Get-Some-Money for the reverent Lenten hymn Gethsamane. Time and again his sacrilegious turn of phrase was detected by a vigilant teacher or cleric, mostly because he kept a serious demeanour while his mates guffawed at his lampooning lyrics.
Yet nothing could dissuade him from his twisted takeoffs. Nothing, categorically nothing, could lessen this burlesque mania. He was flogged ruthlessly for this addiction to satirize by fuming teachers and religious Lasallian Brothers at our school, St. Bens.
The thunderous slaps he received for this particular transgression were of such stunning magnitude that sounds of the wallops reverberated in the ears of his fellow students long after they had been administered. But hard-boiled Boyd remained oblivious to the punishment meted out by the slap-happy pedagogues. Astonishingly, he remained unmoved although both his facial cheeks took on the colourful hue similar to that of a Toque Macaque monkey. And his blistered bottom had the distinct resemblance to a baboons flaming red butt.
Still you did have to admire his affinity for turning the other cheek, even if it was not done solely in the true spirit of Christianity. Now the grandkids have caught on to copying the holiday song raillery. And what do I keep hearing Melodies, parodies and more lyrical spoofs. Right throughout the season I hear my little Loony Tunes Chipmunk quartet distorting the holiday lyrics.
Do you hear what I hear or am I hallucinating Are the tiny voices really singing: While shepherds washed their socks by night And when they serve the postman, the drivers and faithful old retainers who always drop by for seasonal largesse they belt out in full throated unison: Oh come all ye faithful come and get a plateful!
Hey, at Christmas or rather Boxing Day morning and I am tempted to put on my pugilistic gloves to defend my peace of mind. I forget the derivation of Boxing Day, but the feeling of wanting to invite your unloved ones outside one at a time and punch them in the face, does that come into it somewhere
I do believe I have red and green bags under my eyes. No they are actually black.
The imagined hues are just a reflection of the green pine tree, the decorative seasonal tinsel and bunting which can play tricks on your eyes. No I am not referring to some of those old society hags who really do tote designer handbags and have Gucci bags under their eyes to match.
I find myself half awake all swaddled in Christmas decorations. The kids have been having a great time wrapping their exhausted old man in all kinds of streamers and bunting. Ok I turn around in bed and hear sleigh bells. Sleigh bells But surely they are bells of some kind and make a heck of a noisy jingle whenever I writhe around. When I attempt to ignore the jingling jangling as I snuggle under the blanket the bells go ding-a-ling-a-ling. I realise by now that I have been festooned with bells on my toes as well.
Now I perceive that the wake-up offensive has been mounted on the scale of a D-Day invasion by midget grandkid insurgents. There is a cacophony of sounds with rattles, blowouts, squawkers, party horns and cap guns firing directly into my eardrums at point blank range. And then Kingsley the tiniest of the clan has been persuaded to climb into my bed and quip: Hey wakey, wakey Dada. Its New Year! I turn around and drawl menacingly: Go away. Who are you I dont know you. This is not Dada. Its the Vampire!
They respond with another parody: We three kings of orient are. Trying to smoke a rubber cigar. It was loaded it exploded. Now were on yonder star... However grumpy I feel there is no getting away from being imbued with the Christmas spirit as I blast off with my own answer in my own Barimatone: All I want for Christmas is a good nights sleep. A good nights sleep, a good nights sleep.
All I want for Christmas is my bed to myself, without this intruding little thief.
This time I am out of bed and the invaders scatter with frightful screams. My toe bells jingle as I wade knee-deep through reams of discarded gift wrapping. I have a funny taste in my mouth and manage to cough up some disgusting tinsel. And the tangle of tinsel is the reason I have lost my voice, while suffering a bout of tinsel-itits.
It is only 7.15 in the morning and I distinctly hear the presence of the earliest visitor. It is the beautiful baritone voice of Boyd belting out the classic, Its The Most Wonderful Time of the Year.
To be sure he has as usual parodied it with: It`s the most wonderful time for a Beer! I also realise that the tree isnt the only thing getting lit up this year, because Boyd is certainly all lit up with the spirit that cheers.
With three broken marriages behind him he serenades every eligible dowager with this parody of the hackneyed Christmas song: Single bells. Single bells, Im single all the way. Oh what fun it is to watch those couples fight all day. Yay! Yay! Yay!"

Personal troubles inspiring new music
Singer Aaron Carter is drawing on his struggle with sobriety and his battle with body dysmorphia to write new music.
The pop star checked himself into a rehabilitation centre in September (17) to seek professional help for his eating disorder and to improve his overall health, and he is now using his personal problems as inspiration for songwriting material.
"I'm feeling very healthy and am so passionate about my music right now and continue to write new songs drawn from these life experiences," Aaron tells the New York Post's Page Six column via his representative.
He has been spending much of his time in the recording studio of late, and his spokesperson reveals fans will get to hear his new album, the follow-up to 2002's Another Earthquake, in February (18).
"Aaron is doing great and is so appreciative of the support of all his fans," the rep shares. "His new single Don't Say Goodbye has received critical acclaim and his first new album in 15 years will be released on Sony/Red next month."
The singer, who recently 'came out' as bisexual, has been trying to get his health and career back on track in recent months after a rough 2017, during which he lost his father, Bob, in May, went public with his addictions to prescription painkillers and cosmetic surgery during an appearance on U.S. TV show The Doctors, and was busted for driving under the influence (DUI) and possession of marijuana during a traffic stop in Georgia in July.
The younger brother of Backstreet Boys star Nick Carter also broke his nose in a car accident near his house in September, days after allegedly becoming the victim of harassment and an attempted burglary.
Aaron capped off his rollercoaster year by celebrating his 30th birthday in early December (17), a milestone he once thought he would never reach.
"I thought I would die by 30," he told Us Weekly in the lead up to his big day. "Even when I was 13, 14, I thought, 'Oh my God. I'm going to die.' Life, it was pretty tough. I dealt with a lot of trauma, a lot of loss, a lot of loneliness. I just felt like I needed to get away."

Philander blasts  South Africa to win over India
Cape Town: South Africas fast bowlers, led by Vernon Philander, blasted through Indias batting as the host nation gained a 72-run win on the fourth day of the first Test at Newlands on Monday.
Set 208 to win the first of three matches between the worlds two leading Test teams, number one-ranked India were bowled out for 135 by their nearest challengers.
Philander took six for 42 with Morne Morkel and Kagiso Rabada claiming two wickets each as India were subjected to a pace barrage in bowler-friendly conditions.
South Africa were reduced to three fast bowlers because of a heel injury suffered by Dale Steyn while bowling on Saturday.
Earlier, it had been the Indian bowlers who held sway when South Africa were bowled out for 130 in their second innings, losing their last eight wickets for 65 runs. Indias run chase started promisingly with Murali Vijay and Shikhar Dhawan putting on 30 for the first wicket, although Vijay was reprieved on review twice after being given out against Philander, for leg before wicket and a catch behind the wicket.
But then Dhawan was caught at gully off his bat handle when he got into a tangle against a lifting ball from Morkel. Six balls later it was third time lucky for Philander as Vijay edged a catch to AB de Villiers at third slip.
Philander claimed the key wicket of Indian captain Virat Kohli, who had looked confident in scoring 28 before he was trapped leg before wicket.
Philander struck again when Rohit Sharma was bowled off an inside edge and Rabada dismissed first innings top scorer Hardik Pandya for one, caught by a diving De Villiers at third slip.
Rabada trapped Wriddhiman Saha leg before with the last ball before tea to leave India in a desperate situation in a match which hastened to a conclusion despite the loss of the third day because of rain.
Ravichandran Ashwin and Bhuvneshwar Kumar put on 49 for the eighth wicket before Philander took the last three wickets in the space of four balls. Mohammed Shami and Jasprit Bumrah were the main destroyers of the South African batting, taking three wickets each.
Shami started the collapse, dismissing Hashim Amla with the ninth ball of the morning and taking three wickets for 28 runs.
Bumrah took three for 39, including the wicket of South African captain Faf du Plessis, who fell to an unplayable delivery which lifted sharply off a good length and flicked a glove.
Despite being ruled out of the rest of the series, Steyn, who arrived at the ground on crutches, limped to the wicket as the last batsman in an effort to keep company with De Villiers, who top-scored with 35.
He managed to defend four balls from Kumar but De Villiers was caught off Bumrah in the next over by Kumar, one of eight fielders stationed on the boundary. Wicketkeeper Saha set an Indian record by taking ten catches in the match, five in each innings.
After being under covers for two nights and a day, the pitch offered plenty of seam movement and occasional steep bounce.
