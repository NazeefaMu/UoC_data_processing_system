Pandemonium reins in House
Pandemonium reigned in Parliament yesterday morning as the Joint Opposition MPs stormed the well of the House when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stood up to make a statement on the Bond issue.
The PM took the floor amidst heavy disturbances of the Joint Opposition MPs and the House was suspended for a Party Leaders Meeting soon after his speech. Ugly scenes unfolded in the House after suspension, ending up in blood shed of MPs and torn up files and documents all over the floor of the main Chamber.
Hit and run games, exchange of fisticuffs and grappling of MPs became the order of the day during the special sitting which also marked the first sitting for this year.
The dramatic scenes started with a demonstration by the JO MPs who held posters on the Bond issue while the PM was on his feet. The posters held by the JO demanded immediate arrest of the Bond culprits. They walked towards the Mace carrying the posters and shouting out slogans. The Serjeant-at-Arms Anil Samarasekera and his deputy Kushan Jayaratne held on to the Mace in the bracket when the Opposition MPs tried to grab it.
Several UNP Backbenchers, who also gathered in the middle of the well, tangled with the JO MPs, but several MPs of both the sides intervened to separate their MPs. Some in the JO were seen throwing paper balls at the Government side benches. JO MPs shouted Ranil Hora (Ranil is a thief) while the UNP Members shouted Mahinda Hora (Mahinda is a thief).
UNP MP Kavinda Jayawardena who was seen arguing with the JO MPs fainted and fell down in the middle of the well. He was taken to a chair and sprinkled water to the face by fellow UNP members Sujeewa Senasinghe, S.M. Marikkar and Ranjan Ramanayake. After a while, MP Jayawardena was taken out of the chamber.
The scenes turned violent soon after the suspension of the House by the Speaker at 11.10am for a Party Leaders Meeting. The JO members and UNP backbenchers clashed head on exchanging blows at each other. The posters, files and documents on the MPs benches were hurled at each other. UNP MP Marrikar punched JO MP Gamini Lokuge on the face and ran out of the chamber, and later on JO MP Prasanna Ranatunga punched UNP MP Chaminda Wijesiri on the face and ran out of the chamber. MP Johnston Fernando was seen punching UNP MPs Chaminda Wijesiri and Hector Appuhamy.
As the situation intensified, UNP MP Rohini Kaviratne was caught up in the middle of the brawl. As she was dragged and pushed by the other MPs, MPs Hirunika Premachandra and Thusitha Wijemanne hurried to help her get out of the fight.
Fully engulfed in the fistfight, JO MP Prasanna Ranaweera was quite oblivious to the fact that his shirt buttons were ripped open. Ranjith de Soysa was injured during the brawl.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was also seen trying to bring the situation under control with Ministers Sagala Rathnayake, Malik Samarawickrama and Vajira Abeywardena. However, the ministers prevented the PM from advancing towards the direction of the brawl. The PM was seen talking to UNP backbenchers as well as MP Dinesh Gunawardena to stop the fight.

MP Lokuge struck me, says MP Marikkar
Colombo District Parliamentarian S.M.Marikkar said that he was struck by MP Gamini Lokuge during the tense situation that erupted in Parliament yesterday.
MP Kavinda Jayawadena who tried to intervene to calm the situation, later fainted. I too got involved to try and calm the violence, but instead of retaliating, I just defended the blows that came my way. Parliament is not a place to fight. This whole situation is aimed at destroying the UNP.
He charged that the Bond Commission report is not presented to Parliament and as the President made his special statement about it in Sinhala, he too had doubts about the translation and interpretation.
We did not come to Parliament to have a fist fight. We too have faced numerous attacks and are well seasoned and we will strike back if struck. We are wondering if this whole situation was staged and if the leaders we appointed were trying to swallow their own tail, like serpents. Investigations should also be conducted regarding those who ruled the country previously as well. Now it is very clear that these parties are behaving like thugs in Parliament, he said.
UNP Parliamentarian Chaminda Wijeseiri said the drama that unfolded in Parliament yesterday was a conspiracy to destroy the UNP.
Addressing a press conference in the Parliamentary Committee Room yesterday, he said while investigations have been conducted by four committees regarding the Bond issue, creating a volatile situation even prior to the report being presented to parliament is highly questionable.
Wijesiri noted that the UNP had no objection to the Bond Commission report being presented to Parliament pointing out that investigations should also be initiated regarding the Treasury Bond transactions during the period 2008 to 2014.
Delaying Bond debate until end of elections, a sinister motive : JVP
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena and TNA MP M A Sumanthiran collectively requested the Speaker in Parliament yesterday, to summon the Secretary to the President or any other official in possession of the Bond report.
They expressed this view that a copy of the report must have been sent to Parliament prior to sending it to the Central Bank and the Bribery Commission, as the control of public finances lie with the legislature.
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake opined that there is a sinister motive of getting the Bond debate delayed until the end of elections. M A Sumanthiran said even the Director of National Archives had received a copy of the report.
MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena also insisted that the Speaker summon the officials in possession of the Bond report to secure a copy and get it tabled in Parliament. Use Parliamentary powers vested with the Speaker to secure a copy of the report today. The public officials are unable to overrule the Speakers decision, he said.
However, the Speaker maintained that the matter should not cause a rift between the Executive and the Legislature. The Prime Minister maintained that the report must be presented to the Cabinet first.
JO, JVP objects to Prime Minister repeating his speech
Due to the tense situation that erupted within the Well of the Parliament during Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes statement on the Treasury Bond Commission report, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya permitted the Prime Minister to deliver his statement for the second time.
Objecting to this move, JO MP Dinesh Gunawardena told the Speaker that the Prime Minister had already expressed his views and this was a mockery of Parliament and urged that Parliament should not be made a joke. He said they attended Parliament to debate the report and not to listen to the Prime Ministers speech.
The Speaker in response, stated that at the Party Leaders meeting held during the ten minute recession, it had been agreed upon to allow the Prime Minister to repeat his speech.
Further, the JVP and the Joint Opposition had boycotted the Party Leaders meeting based on the charge that there was no point in them being there if decisions were taken based on individual desires.
However, objecting to the decision taken by the Speaker to allow the Prime Minister to repeat his statement, all Joint Opposition members walked out of the Chamber in protest.
At the time, even the JVP members were not present during the Prime Ministers speech.
JO MP uploads live Facebook videos of MPs exchange of fisticuffs
Joint Opposition MP Kanchana Wijesekara uploaded live Facebook videos of their demonstration in Parliament yesterday which ended up in exchanging fisticuffs.
Parliamentarians were not allowed to take photos inside the main chamber, but in recent times, MPs were frequently seen using their high-tech mobile phones to take pictures of what was happening inside the chamber.
These photos were later circulated in social media platforms.
However, this would be the first time that an MP went live on Facebook inside the main chamber, while the sittings were in progress.
The video footage showed how JO MPs misbehaved in Parliament and how the JO and the UNP back-benchers clashed with each other.
The comments received to the video indicated the publics anger towards the conduct of MPs in Parliament for which Rs 5 million public funds are said to be spent in conducting a days sittings.
Dont use Bond report as a political tool :Alagiyawanna
Deputy Minister of Finance and Mass Media Lasantha Alagiyawanna, representing the sentiments of the SLFP, said the Bond issue report should not be used as a political tool to gain advantage over another party.
Addressing Parliament yesterday during the special session convened to discuss the Treasury Bond investigation report, he said that as a result of the attention paid by the whole country to the Treasury bond scam, all political parties represented in Parliament were unanimously of the view that a proper investigation should be carried out regarding the Bond scandal.
The COPE Committee initially headed by Dew Gunasekara which is now headed by Sunil Handunnetti, initiated a comprehensive investigation. The SLFP appointed a separate committee to investigate this scandal and submit a report. If you basically summarise all these reports, what could eventually be summed up is that a comprehensive investigation should be done regarding this scandal. It was then that President Maithripala Sirisena established the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) to investigate the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, he added.
Alagiyawanna noted that at the time the Presidential Commission was appointed, the Joint Opposition said that this was an attempt to slander the opposition. Then when the Commission was in the process of conducting their investigations and wanted their term extended, the Opposition alleged that the Commissions term was being extended to cover up the incident.
Ever since this Commission was appointed, the Joint Opposition always viewed it cross-eyed.
However, due to the unprecedented interest generated among various political groups and the public, the President for the first time, took the decision to issue a statement based on the crucial points of the report. Similarly, most of the political parties, including the SLFP were also of the view that this report should be tabled in Parliament and taken up for debate.
A party leaders meeting was convened on Tuesday and it was discussed and as a result it was told that the report would be presented to Parliament on January 17, subsequent to satisfying the relevant procedural measures.
He said many factors were unravelled during this investigation which is a complex matter. Therefore, proper procedures should be followed with regard to this report which would be presented to Parliament on January 17. However, if the requirement to present it to Parliament earlier arises, this too could be done. However, what is most relevant in this whole incident is that such fraudulent acts should never take place in this country in the future, adding that this should be the sole intention as a country and political parties should not try to use this situation to gain petty political mileage.
Many such issues will be probed :Senasinghe
Endorsing the sentiments expressed by Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna, that incidents such as the bond issue should never be repeated in this country, the State Minister for International Trade Sujeewa Senasinghe said not just this issue, but many such issues had been revealed as a result of investigations initiated by the good governance government.
He noted that the Prime Minister had taken all possible measures to initiate investigations on many projects and establishments, as he had nothing to hide. The members of this Parliament even pointed fingers at the Speaker who acted appropriately, based on requests made to him. In fact what the Prime Minister intended was to set the stage for a discussion or debate on the bond issue report. But, I dont understand why the report has not been presented to Parliament and what these secret contents are that is preventing it from being given to us, he said, adding that it was no fault of the Speaker.
All allegations of corruption should be fairly investigated : Sampanthan
Acts of corruption committed in the country, in the past as well as at present, must be fairly investigated by going in to their roots, Opposition Leader R Sampanthan told Parliament yesterday, adding that the country should be kept informed of the truth.
We would join with the other members in agreeing that the report of the Bond Commission must be tabled in Parliament at its earliest and be debated. There is no room for any dispute with regard to that matter. This is a matter that concerns public funds. Parliament and the people in the country have an interest on this matter. I would urge both the Bond and PRECIFAC reports be tabled in Parliament and debated by getting into the roots of the matter.
We have a history in this country where commission reports were never made public. I must congratulate the President and the Prime Minister for having made the contents of the report public. I would urge you to make the full report public and have a debate on it, he said. City Planning and Water Supply Minister Rauf Hakeem also stressed the fact that delaying the tabling of the full report of the Bond Commission was unfair. The sections of the report were given out to the media. Certain parties may try to take political mileage out of this issue at the verge of a grass root level election. Nobody can play with the law by making the officials responsible. We feel that there is an underhand game going on. I urge the Speaker to use his powers to the maximum to sort out this problem, he said.

Poor regulation creates poorly performing markets - Dr. Delia Rodrigo
Poor regulation creates poorly performing markets with less wealth, income, employment and growth and businesses, said , Senior Consultant of Regulatory Reform, United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO).
Due to poor regulations, businesses also have low confidence in regulatory system and seek to avoid regulatory obligations including by choosing to operate in the informal sector, Dr. Rodrigo said.
Dr.Rodrigo said the governments lose control of regulatory system and faces issues such as dysfunctional systems, corruption, reduced taxation revenues and so on due to poor regulations.
She expressed these views delivering a speech on Regulatory Impact Analysis as a Tool to Improve The Quality Of Regulation at a workshop , held under the theme ,  Improving Regulatory Quality for Economic and Social Development held in Colombo.
Poor regulations also create risks and hazards in many fields, such as environment, health, workplace and etc,she said.
In order to use the various regulatory tools and factors in an effective manner, a strategic view and high political support is needed; Dr. Rodrigo said adding that political alignment of regulators and sequence and gradualism are also important to use existing resources and to integrate new tools over time.
Meanwhile, UN Resident Coordinator and United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) Resident Representative Una Mc Cauley emphasised the need to formulate systematic, participatory, evidence based, transparent regulations by the policy makers to make important decisions for the benefit of the country as well as the general public.
According to Cauley , adopting proper consumer protection regulations too will improve food safety, food standards, exports as well as address health issues like malnutrition and over nutrition in an effective manner in Sri Lanka.

President will keep his word - SLFP
Members of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) addressing the media after the tense situation in Parliament yesterday said the President will keep to his word and make the Bond Commission report public.
The Prime Minister had requested that the Speaker convene Parliament yesterday without having a report in hand to debate, they said. This has been done on the advice of the Attorney General. Special Assignments Minister, Dr. Sarath Amunugama together with Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, Science, Technology and Research State Minister, Lakshman Senewiratne and Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala stressed that the report was not tabled in Parliament yesterday because there was not enough time given to the President to follow due procedure.
Minister Amunugama further said the President had received a letter from the Speaker at 4pm on Tuesday (9) asking whether it was possible to table the Bond Commission in Parliament yesterday (10).
Today people have shed blood over a report they have not seen or read, Minister Amunugama said.
Co-cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday also informed the Cabinet media briefing held at Parliament that a Commission report has to be translated into all three languages and receive Cabinet approval to be made public, before it can be tabled in Parliament, It is not possible to translate a 1457 page report in a few days. It took four months to translate the LLRC report alone, he said.
At the SLFP media briefing, Minister Amunugama said, However we commend the President to having agreed to submit the report to Parliament within a week. The Bond Commission has acted in a transparent manner that was not seen before and the President set great precedence by releasing the findings of the Commission through a state address, within a week of the report being handed to him.
The next step he said was for the Attorney General to prepare and file an indictment against all those who are responsible.
Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna in the meantime stated that certain individuals and parties were carrying false propaganda against the report, Many people have asked why action is not being taken immediately and why no one is arrested. But we say that those who say this either do not understand the complexity of the issue or they are trying to score petty political points.

President will present Bond Commission report on January 17
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday announced that President Maithripala Sirisena has informed that the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry on Bond issue will be presented to Parliament on January 17.
The Speaker reading out a letter received from Secretary to the President Austin Fernando said the President has instructed to send 26 copies of the bond report to Parliament by next Wednesday.
The letter also informed that the copies of the Bond report were handed over to the Central Bank Governor Dr Indrajit Coomaraswamy and the Committee to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption Director General Sarath Jayamanne yesterday morning to implement its recommendations.
The letter further said the Presidential Secretariat has informed that it does not have the 34 reports submitted by the PRECIFAC.The Secretary to the President has informed the Speaker that he would get the copies of those reports from the PRECIFAC Secretary and send them to Parliament.
Leader of the House,Minister Lakshman Kiriella wrote to the President requesting the Bond report along with the 34 PRECIFAC reports. Speaker Jayasuriya had also made the request orally.
The Speaker after reading out the letter told the House that he intends to meet the Secretary to the President and the Attorney General to discuss the matter.The Speaker however appealed not to incite a clash between the Executive and Legislature as a result of this issue.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament that he could not agree with the Attorney Generals position on the issue, adding that not tabling the report is against the law and traditions. He invited the other Party Leaders to join in the meeting with the AG to collectively remind him of the powers of Parliament.
The Prime Minister said he would meet with President Maithripala Sirisena in the evening and inform the opinions raised in Parliament and urge him to present the report to the House at the earliest. Since I am also a character in the entire saga, I too am interested in knowing the content of the report. Parliament has done everything in its capacity over the Bond issue, he added.
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake questioned as to how could the Presidential Secretariat inform that it does not have the 34 reports handed over to the President by the PRECIFAC. The reports were handed over to the President. It is irresponsible to claim that the reports are not with the Secretariat, he added.

Pursuing scientific pursuits
If you work hard, you can teach physics to engineers. But, to be honest, choosing physical sciences is a risk. Not everyone can finish their education with a PhD in Physics. But it is a risk worth taking
The physicist Hans Bethe once said, There are two types of genius. Ordinary geniuses do great things, but they leave you room to believe that you could do the same if only you worked hard enough. Then there are magicians, and you can have no idea how they do it.
In the world of science, ever so often we come across visionaries, magicians in the words of Bethe, who dare to perceive the world in ways no one else has before. Darshana L Weerawarne is one of them. The 31 year old youth is the first Sri Lankan student of the Binghamton Physics Department of the New York State University to follow a PHD in how laser light interacts with matter and the use of laser light to capture and visualize ultrafast [femtosecond] time dynamics such as molecular rotation and chemical reactions that even the sophisticated electronics camera systems cannot resolve.
An old boy of Maurapada National School, Mawanella, and Dharmaraja College, Kandy, Darshana has a number of noteworthy accolades to his name. He was the first student of Maurapada National School to get 10 As at the G C E Ordinary Level examination. After graduating from Colombo University he worked as an instructor in physics in the Department of Physics for a short spell before becoming a visiting lecturer in electronics and a research assistant for the Sustainable Computing Research (SCORE) group of UCSC lead by Dr. Kasun De Zoysa and Dr. Chamath Keppitiyagama.They were working on a project that aimed to develop smart home systems in collaboration with Orange Electric Sri Lanka. They had all the expertise in wireless sensor networks but not someone with the background in electronics. This was when Darshana stepped in.

The goal of the project was to design and develop a smart home system, including software and hardware, to remotely monitor the power usage of a house and control the switches and other connected appliances through a mobile phone or a web interface. The system consisted of a network of tiny sensors. Each sensor was equipped with a set of electronic sensors such as temperature, humidity, electrical power, etc, and an electrical switching module. The sensors could talk to one another, to a smartphone, or to a web interface. The users could monitor the power usage of the devices connected to the network and switch on/off the connected devices. They didnt have to be near the devices to control. The user could monitor and control their devices even from their work even when they are not at their homes. This is well before we had any commercial smart home systems, at least in Sri Lanka. This system inherited a unique feature from SCORE labs prior research project called TikiriDB; a sensor network programming interface which treats the entire sensor network as a database. An individual who is very new to sensor network programming can easily communicate with the sensor network if he or she knows how to send and receive data from a database. We named our smart home system TikiriPower because it used TikiriDB. We published this work in Advances in ICT for Emerging Regions (ICTer), 2012 International Conference, Darshana explained adding that apart from Orange Electric Sri Lanka many other providers such as Dialog, Mobitel, etc have now started popularizing the smart home concept in Sri Lanka .
Though no one from his immediate family has taken to physics, some of Darshanas relatives have followed mathematics for their G C E A/L examinations. Since they have made it into the engineering profession Darshanas parents too wanted him to follow their footsteps.
Fortunately for me (but unfortunately for my parents), my advanced level examination results were not high enough for me to get in to engineering. Of course, I could have tried a second or third time. I also got a Sri Lankan government scholarship (through the ministry of higher education) to follow engineering in India. However, the choice of becoming an engineer vs a physicist was not easy. I had to try very hard to convince others why they should let me do physical sciences rather than engineering, he said.
He says that choosing maths for advanced level was self-driven, most probably because he thought that he was good at the subject. However choosing physics had a special reason.
I was always fascinated with optics and light. As a little kid I was very curious about the fact that my Optometrist was able to put a set of lenses onto my eyes and tell if I could see clearly or not just by shining a light onto my eyes. Now I know that she was using a retinoscope to shine light into my eyes and observe the reflection off the retina. But as a kid, it was magic to me, he recalled.
Darshana says that the society embodies a misconception that the eventual fate of advanced level maths students should be is to end up as engineers.
Even today when I talk to young students in Sri Lanka about their choice of engineering vs physical sciences, they beat me with their extraordinarily demotivated attitudes towards physical sciences. They think that if someone follows physical sciences, the only profession he or she can get into is teaching in a high school. If you work hard, you can teach physics to engineers. But, to be honest, choosing physical sciences is a risk. Not everyone can finish their education with a PhD in Physics. But it is a risk worth taking.
There are many resources for students in physical sciences.
There are even Sri Lankan student groups in other countries focused on helping Sri Lankans pursue degrees in science and other disciplines. I know from my personal experience that foreign universities are eager to take in more Sri Lankan students. Sri Lanka is among the top 20 countries by the number of United States PhD recipients according to National Science Foundation (NSF) survey of earned doctorates, he stressed.
He notes that every physical phenomenon has some governing physics behind it. It can be a simple rainbow, or it can be a complex earth centered satellite.
Once you learn physics, you learn to see the fascinating details of even the simple things you encounter in nature. I think the same goes with most of the sciences, Darshana added.
The fastest traveling thing on earth is light. Light can travel 7.5 time around the earth in one second. Therefore, even the most sophisticated electronic camera system cannot resolve the dynamics of light. In my field of research, there is a unique technique that we can use to see dancing molecules and bouncing light. Its amazing to see how simple techniques can give you interesting information about unseen science, he enthused.
He says that laser science involves working with man-made instruments like lasers. Sometimes they work, but sometimes they dont.
When the laser works, it might take one hour to finish your experiment or one week. Either way, you should be ready to stand for hours in front of a laser performing experiments. You might have to repeat the experiment multiple times. Simply, you should be hardworking and dedicated, he noted on what it takes to excel in the field.
The biggest challenge he has come across involved balancing work and his personal life during his PhD years.
This is relevant especially for those who are engaged in experimental sciences. Once the experiment starts they cannot go home until the experiment is done. Therefore, the priority always goes to the experiment. We must be very careful because the experiment can be redone, but the life cannot be reversed or repeated, he opined.
Seeing the most fundamental physics he has learnt, applied to real life, making a positive impact in the society around him motivates him. He is also passionate about working with children who do not have access to educational resources, especially science.
The SCORE team at UCSC deployed a low-cost computer system called Pokuru PC developed by former members of the team in one of the rural schools in the Ampara district in 2011. This was a group effort lead by Dr. Kasun De Zoysa of UCSC. The computer uses one PC but can simultaneously be used by four users. It was heart-whelming to see how these little kids adapted to the new technology. It was the first time they ever saw a computer, but they managed to figure out how it works, he added with a smile.
He was also involved in Promise Zone, a University-community effort to create improved learning environments for school children in high-needs communities from 2014 to2017. His part was to prepare and conduct science activities based on different concepts of physics for children in grandparent headed families and children from economically disadvantaged families.
Darshana loves applying the physics he has learnt to find solutions to real life problems.
With the development of new technology there are millions of simple ways to contribute to the society. Google Crowdsource; an application introduced by google to improve the quality of free google services such as google translate, google maps, google search, is once such way I find interesting. Being a Sri Lankan, it is very interesting that I can contribute to the Sinhala language by handwriting recognition, translation, and translation validation. I used to be one of the handful of top level contributors. Now I see more people, especially young Sri Lankans, contributing more, Darshana said.
Born and raised in Mawanella, Darshana resides in Vestal, New York, USA today. He works as a postdoctoral fellow at Center for Advanced Microelectronics Manufacturing (CAMM) of Binghamton University with Prof. Mark D. Poliks. His work focuses on printing and laser processing of flexible and wearable electronic devices. His ambition is to become a physicist whose science can serve the people in need.
Physics is not just what you learnt in your textbooks. It is what you see in every physical phenomenon that happens around you. If you are curious enough to question why a raindrop has the shape of a bun not a teardrop, physics is for you. Try to relate the physics you learn to what surrounds you, are his words of wisdom for youth who wish to pursue physics.
During the Physics Outreach Program 2016 in Vestal, New York.

CAPE TOWN: Kagiso Rabada has become the No 1-ranked bowler in the ICC Test rankings after helping South Africa to an exciting 72-run victory over India in the first Test at Newlands on Monday.
Rabada, who was one of the stars in South Africa's successful campaign in the ICC Under-19 World Cup in the UAE in 2014, returned figures of 3/34 and 2/41 against a star-studded India batting line-up.
For his efforts, the 22-year-old has collected five points, while England's James Anderson, who had entered the Sydney Test against Australia as the No 1-ranked bowler, dropped by the same number of points following the last Ashes Test. This 10-point swing means the Proteas paceman has moved ahead of the Englishman by one point after nine points had separated the two fast bowlers leading into the two Tests.
"It's special to be ranked as the No 1 Test bowler in the world. It is a surreal feeling. Its what you dream of achieving when you start playing the game," Rabada said.
"Cricket is ultimately a team sport and I'm thankful for the support from my team-mates. It's a great start to the year personally and for us as a team, hopefully we can continue putting in winning performances."
Rabada is the seventh South Africa bowler to top the Test bowling rankings after Aubrey Faulkner, Hugh Tayfield, Peter Pollock, Shaun Pollock, Dale Steyn and Vernon Philander.
Rabada's team-mate Philander is the other bowler inside the top-20 to make an impressive gain. For his match figures of 9/75 - which also earned him the player of the match award - the 32-year-old has earned 67 points, which, in turn, has lifted him from 12th to sixth position.
Philander now trails Australia's fifth-ranked Josh Hazlewood by eight points and has an opportunity to break into the top-five following the second Test against India that starts in Centurion on Saturday.

Rejection of nomination list, SLFP seeks SC remedy
Six members of Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) have filed a Fundamental Rights petition in the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order restraining the Election Commission from taking further steps under the provisions of the Local Authorities Elections Ordinance to proceed with holding the election to the Dehiattakandiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
They are seeking an order in the nature of writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Maharagama Urban Council to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the SLPP for the election of members to the Maharagama Urban Council.
The nomination papers handed by the SLFP were rejected for the reason that they have been handed over by a person who is not the authorized agent or the secretary of the party and the required number of female candidates were not named in the same.
This petition was filed through counsel Sanjeewa Kaluarachchi.
The petitioners had cited Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Ampara District), SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hasheem and JVP General Secretary Tilvin Silva as respondents.

RFMTA calls for removal of SLMC VP
Ruhunu Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association (RFMTA) has sent a letter to the Registrar of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) requesting removal of the SLMC Vice President, RFMTA Secretary Dr. Arjuna De Silva said.
According to Dr. Silva, SLMC has agreed upon the minimum entry criteria for Sri Lankan medical faculties at a previous meeting. This decision was taken after discussing this matter at length with the respective faculty boards.
The decision was that the lowest grades obtained by students in the preceding year would be considered.
When this matter was discussed at the Cabinet, the above decision was changed and they agreed upon two Cs and one S as the minimum entry criteria.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathne has mentioned at a press conference that the state medical faculty Deans also have endorsed this change.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had mentioned the same fact at one of Deputy Minister Dr. Harsha de Silvas committee meetings in the presence of the SLMC Vice President and representatives from RFMTA, GMOA and AMS.
In the same meeting, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne mentioned that President Maithripala Sirisena had communicated with Deans, pointing to the fact that SLMC Vice President and Deans are in agreement with this decision.
The SLMC Vice President had never objected to this at that time. Therefore we strongly believe that the SLMC Vice President is behind this dramatic change of minimum entry criteria and acted as representative of all Deans of state medical faculties without any consent from the other Deans, he said.
At another SLMC meeting the SLMC Vice President has voiced and emphasized the ideas to award SLMC recognition to SAITM graduates without an extra
training for community medicine, psychiatry and forensic medicine when most of the other members of the SLMC council were emphasizing that an extra training is mandatory for the above subjects. Trying to undermined the quality of medical education of the country and trying to ignore the collective decision making process of the medical faculties is an unacceptable behaviour from a Dean of a of state medical faculty. We strongly believe that the collective decision of the SLMC council members should go forward and implemented rather than implementing the Vice Presidents own idea. We believe that since the SLMC Vice President has undue advantage of behaving as a representative of other Deans and SLMC. Considering the above fact, Ruhuna Faculty of Medicine Teachers Association (RFMTA) request SLMC to consider removal the SLMC Vice President, he added.

Ricky Martin confirms he's married!

Ricky Martin is a married man!
The star ofThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Storysays exclusively to E! News in the clip above,"I'm a husband, but we're doing a heavy party in a couple of months, I'll let you know."
Although no formal celebration has taken place, the 46-year-old singer says he andJwan Yosefhave done everything else to prep for the special occasion.
"We exchanged vows, and we've swear [sic] everything, and we've signed all the papers that we needed to sign, prenups and everything."
Our ownWill Marfuggiexplains to Martin how excited he was to use the formal term for the first time and Martin says he shares the same excitement.
"It feels amazing! I can't introduce him as my fianc. I can't. He's my husband. He's my man," Martin says.
The couple is promising a huge bash, and Martin says guestscan expect to party for three days, although they still don't know precisely where this celebration will take place.
"The typical three-day party, the dinner, the rehearsal, the party and the recovery. You'll be the first to know," Martin says.
The pair began dating in 2016 and in November later that year Martinannounced onThe Ellen DeGeneres Showthat they were engaged.
"We just got engaged," Martin said. "I'm sweating!"
Martin was "nervous" when he proposed. "I got on my knees and I took out the little metal box.
I just had it in a little velvet pouch and instead of saying, 'Will you marry me' I said, 'I got you something!' Bad," the singer said. "Then he was like, 'Yes.' I said, 'I want to spend my life with you,' and he was like, 'What is the question' 'Would you marry me' That's it." He described the proposal as "very beautiful," even if it took 30 minutes for him to realize Yosef said "yes."
"I'm so happy for you," DeGeneres told Martin. "You deserve that."
Congratulations to both Ricky and Jwan on their exciting news!

Actress Mouni Roy, who portrayed the lead character in the first two seasons of Naagin, will now part from the show as she passes on the crown to another actress.
Mouni has been the headlines for the show so far in which she portrayed Shivanya and Shivangi. She was paired with Arjun Bijlani in the first season and With Karanvir Bohra in the second.
The first season of the show became the highest rated show on TV and Mouni Roy became a household name. This led to the success of the second season as well.

SA coach wants to continue pace barrage in Second Test
CENTURION: South Africa coach Ottis Gibson is happy with four fast bowlers in his team against India and has hinted at continuing with the same strategy in the second Test to be held at SuperSport Park in Centurion from Saturday.
After the team's 72-run win in the opening Test at Cape Town, which was effectively achieved inside three days with a four-pronged pace pack, Gibson indicated that the team composition will not change in the remainder of the rubber.
"I'm a very fast-bowling minded coach and I guess we will always have to find a balance to see if we can get four fast bowlers in the team, first of all," Gibson was quoted as saying.
"We'll look at things like are the conditions suited to four fast bowlers. If not we try and shape the team in other ways.
"Ultimately, especially in this series and for the rest of the summer, we will be looking to see how best we can fit four fast bowlers into whatever formula we come up with," he added.
The hosts went into the Newlands Test with their strongest quartet of seamers -- Dale Steyn, Vernon Philander, Morne Morkel and Kagiso Rabada -- and on a pitch with good pace, bounce and carry bowled India out for scores of 209 and 135 despite losing Steyn to injury midway through the match.
With surfaces only expected to get spicier as the series moves up-country to SuperSport Park and The Wanderers, Gibson wants to keep the same structure to the side.
While Steyn has been ruled out of the remaining matches with a heel injury, the Proteas on Tuesday added rookie pacers Duanne Olivier and Lungi Ngidi to their attack. All-rounders Chris Morris and Andile Phehlukwayo are already in the side and are most likely to be included to strengthen the batting for the second and third Tests.
"When you are playing at home, you must play to your strengths," Gibson said.
"If you want to beat the best team in the world, which India are, then maybe we have to do something slightly different to what we've done in the past.
"We have to get stuck in and be tough with the bat and the ball; get in their faces a bit and use our physicality in terms of our pace.
"We had, in this game, three guys bowling over 140 (kph) so we need to use that and have a presence that says we are trying to get to where you are as a team," he added. - IANS

Serendib Leisure  refurbishes Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya in Kalutara
Serendib Leisure Management stepped to the aid of the flood-affected community of Neboda, Kalutara by refurbishing the Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya that was severely damaged during the devastating floods which affected many parts of Sri Lanka in May 2017.
The Kalutara district was one of the most affected areas out of over 14 districts impacted by the floods and landslides that resulted from heavy rainfall in the South Eastern parts of the island. With hotels of its chain located in the vicinity, Serendib Leisure Management initiated a project to help rebuild Kalutara and bring relief to its community in the wake of the destruction.
Chief Operating Officer of Serendib Leisure Management, Shantha Kurumbalapitiya said, We are grateful to the GA of Kalutara and Divisional Secretariat for informing us of the dire need to lend a helping hand to the community of Neboda.
Having already witnessed the destruction that the floods and landslides caused the community, we did not hesitate to offer our assistance to help restore the lives of those affected.
I am also proud to note that the Serendib Leisure team went the extra mile to reduce costs from its Annual Awards ceremony and contributed it to this worthy cause. Further, it was extremely heartening to witness the community coming together, from the School Principal to the parents, teachers and students who rallied together to rebuild an establishment that is close to their hearts.
The restoration of the Kudaligama Maha Vidyalaya in Neboda, Kalutara, which was carried out over a period of three months by Serendib Leisure Management together with the community of Neboda, successfully reached completion in November.

Sketching the greeny giants
Charmaine Mendis and Minha Mahushukeen, together with their guest artist Karunasiri Wijesinghe will hold their exhibition For the love of Trees from January 19  22 at the Lionel Wendt Art gallery from 9.30 am  7 pm daily.
The paintings and drawings created by Charmaine in this exhibition she say are an expression of myself, my feelings, my experiences, my escape; they are my meditations, my relaxation, and the meanderings of my mind, whilst my body is firmly rooted in the mundane present.
According to Charmaine, her only employment of technique is in the tree drawings. They are the result of my mentor, Karunasiri Wijesinghes inspiration, encouragement and training, although in my own estimation I fall far short of the perfection he requires. For me these drawings have been a giant step in my progress. The black and white designs are the creative wanderings of my pen, done mostly on long airline flights. My mind just follows the meanderings of my hand, and I get lost in their creation. The colour pencil work tries to capture the unseen nuances of colour in Nature. The colour washes are experimental. I just go with the flow, she said.
When it came to Art, Charmaine was always keen on sketching and drawing, mostly landscapes of sorts, which always had trees. They were always leafless as I was unsure just how to draw leaves. I never succeeded in conquering perspective and was always aware of this. Somehow I managed to sneak in a painting or two, into the annual art show of St Bridgets Convent, and surprisingly, even won the prize one year, she said.
The turning point in Charmaines artistic life came in 2005 when she went to see an exhibition of black and white tree drawings by Karunasiri Wijesinghe. I was absolutely enthralled, and it was then that I knew beyond a doubt that this was how I wanted to draw trees. I immediately enrolled at the Vibhavi Academy of Fine Arts, where he was teaching, and began really learning to draw, from the basic cube upwards. I soon moved on to real life trees, learning all the subtleties of light and shade, texture and grain and so much more, she explained.
When Karunasiris contract was over, he agreed to start a class at home, where two or three of them began working together. We sketched always from life, going out of Colombo on sketching trips, even to Yala for a whole five days of serious work, not animal viewing. The results of those trips and our weekly classes, was Vruksha, an exhibition of black and white drawings of the trees of Sri Lanka. This was in 2011. Then came Svayam, which is a Sanskrit word with many meanings. I have used it in the context of self. On January19 we have For the love of Trees and I hope that the many lovers of nature in Sri Lanka will visit our exhibition, Mendis added.
Meanwhile Minha traces her identity as an artist to two sources. The first a deep appreciation of natures wondrous forms and the second is the passion for drawing. From these two wellsprings has flown a stream of inspiration that has guided my development from a young age, Minha said. She is most appreciative of her mothers encouragement of her early creative efforts and she is also fondly referred to as the tree woman by her friends.

Southern Province hub of educational development in SL - Minister Rasaputhra
Southern Province has presently been the hub of educational development in Sri Lanka. Most of the Southern provincial students have been capable of achieving excellent results in examinations conducted so far by the government, Southern Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
He expressed these views addressing as the chief invitee at a felicitation ceremony held in honour of the recently retired principal Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera of the Thihagoda Junior School.
There are some politicians who are inciting acts of thuggery and violence to gain their political objectives. As a veteran and experienced politician he would never resort to such acts of violence. The voters should be allowed to decide future destiny of the politician based on people friendly services rendered by him, Minister Rasaputhra said.
It is hardly possible to run a school satisfying politicians, parents and all others. It is also difficult for a Buddhist monk with abundant sense of loving kindness and compassion to carry out the duties of a proper school administrator. Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera was appointed principal of this school by him. The principal Thera maintained a proper discipline and administration in this school to the best of satisfaction of all, Minister Rasaputhra said.
Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said that there is an excess of teachers in some schools while some other schools in remote rural areas in the region have a shortage of teaching staff.
In spite of all these obstacles he expressed his deep sense of gratitude to both teachers and students for making better academic achievements, so as to bring honour to the Southern Province in Sri Lanka.
A recent survey carried out in South has revealed that the lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children in view of want of parental protection, poverty and disruptions of families led to a decrease in examination results of some children in certain schools.
SPC Education Ministry is also exploring the possibility of avoiding all these hassles and affected children be admitted to childrens homes and afford them a quality education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these strategies, he said. He said, children are the asset of the country. Financial allocations making for them would not be an invaluable investment to mold a brighter future for them. It is not a waste of money but a valuable investment. Affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the cherished aim of his ministry.
He said, in the national educational development process, the study of Engineering Technology has been prioritized. Proper facilities have to be provided for students to study these subjects, Minister Chandima Rasaputhra added.
Plans are afoot to further boost the academic attainments and examination results of all students in state schools in the Southern Province. Speedy measures have also been initiated to enhance the physical and human resources in affected schools in the Southern province, he said.
The educational development of the children would be the vision and mission of the SPC Education Ministry, he further added. Retired principal Ven. Bengamuwe Wimala Thera and several higher education officials also addressed the meeting.

Star Wars: The Last Jedi
From spark TO FIERY FORCE
Progressing at a swift-pace, Star Wars: The Last Jedi establishes an action-packed movie teeming with twists and turns, with a new and unique tone.
With their position compromised, the Resistance flees from the clutches of the First Order, but their sparks of hope fade as they are caught in a deadlock. To escape their impending doom, Finn and a maintenance worker of the Resistance named Rose Tico set out on a secret mission, which takes them to the city of Canto Bight on the planet of Cantonica. Meanwhile, Rey meets Luke Skywalker on Ahch-To, requesting his aid against the First Order, as well as to help her master the Force.
Refreshing change
The Last Jedi delivers a gripping storyline supported by excellent and unexpected plot twists throughout the moviea refreshing change to theStar Wars franchise. The plots progression perfectly builds the tension for upcoming scenes, whilst keeping the audience at the edge of their seats; and the movie also builds anticipation for particular outcomes, only to shatter all expectations.
The combination of the dialogues, music, and the performances of the actors and actresses successfully present not only dark and dramatic scenes, but also emotional and humorous ones as well. Director/Writer Rian Johnson has done a brilliant job in setting up these varying atmospheres and in delving into the deep-seated dissonance within characters. We now not only see a conflicted villain, but a conflicted hero as well.

The Last Jedi delivers a gripping storyline supported by excellent and unexpected plot twists throughout the moviea refreshing change to theStar Wars franchise. The plots progression perfectly builds the tension for upcoming scenes, whilst keeping the audience at the edge of their seats; and the movie also builds anticipation for particular outcomes, only to shatter all expectations.


Where Star Wars: The Force Awakens only scratched the surface of Kylo Rens inner conflict and ambitions, The Last Jedi takes us to its roots, shedding some light on his past. This establishes a better connection between viewers and him. Adam Drivers portrayal of Ren is fantastic as his character struggles to come to terms with his doubts and fearsto break free from the shackles that hold him down and become what he is meant to be.
Akin to Ren, Luke Skywalker is also seen battling his inner demons. He is not the Luke he once was. Where once stood an optimistic hero willing to come to the aid of any who were wrongedwithout a second thoughtnow lies an apathetic, grief-stricken shell. Mark Hamills performance is indeed very powerful on this new take on his character. Every word, every facial expression compelling conveys the pain, guilt, and despair that has struck him down and led him into isolation, as penitence for his past mistake.
Sense of morality
Daisy Ridley continues to do a spectacular job as her character, Rey, attempts to understand the powers and abilities that have awoken within her. Coming from nowhere and not knowing anything about her origins, Rey is on a journey to find her place amidst all the chaos that has unfolded before her. Her empathy and strong sense of morality, along with her unyielding will, are captivating and shine throughout the movie.
The chemistry between Ridley and Hamill is quite strong, as Luke helps Rey to reach her true potential and Rey attempts to understand the reasons behind Lukes reluctance to rejoin the fight. Their relationship, though rough in the beginning, loses its friction as they both acknowledge their sides of the storya journey well-balanced with poetry, drama, and amusement, all leading to a shocking revelation.
Poe Dameron, Finn, and Rose get their fair share of the spotlight and bring in much humour to the movie. The movie gives Poe a captivating space battle sequence, in which his headstrong attitude gets him into trouble. Finn and Roses quest sets a more lighthearted tone to the story, but it also makes the movie lose its pace. But aside from cheering up the crowd, Finn and Rose are also challengedthe story tests the lengths theyd go to in order to protect the ones they care for and stand up for what is right, regardless of the cost. Oscar Isaac (Poe), David Boyega (Finn), and Kelly Marie Tran (Rose) meet all these aspects that their respective characters face with great precision.
Although it does lose momentum while switching between certain sequences, The Last Jedi gradually builds up more and more suspense until the very end. The close-combat sequences were quite intense, and the new weapon variations introduced were an exciting spectacle to behold.
Considering the cinematography, aside from the wide shots perfectly capturing the lightsaber duels, other noteworthy shots were the aerial and establishing shots involving the island Luke has chosen exile on, and the close-up shots involving the main charactersparticularly the ones that highlight their expressions of anguish. While integrating aspects of the original series with his own additions, Johnson also dabbles in unexplored characteristics of the Force itself; and similar to a line mentioned in The Last Jedi, the movie itself kicks off with a spark that soon ignites a fiery force.
In the end, uniting features both old and new, Star Wars: The Last Jedi brings forth a new and breathtaking experience for fans.

Think Equal
Not very long ago, a child was denied school admission because his father had died from HIV/AIDS. This is not the first story of discrimination, several other incidents were reported lately of children, men and women being discriminated, bullied, raped and killed.
The Global School Health Survey - 2017 conducted by the Health Ministry indicated that bullying in schools was a significant factor which affected children in Sri Lanka. Bullying statistics showed that approximately 31 percent of students in schools across the island have suffered from either traditional or internet bullying.It further stated that, in Kandy, the second largest city on the island and capital of the Central Province, approximately 78.1percent of boys and 26.5 percent of girls had been bullied.
A defect in the Education System
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Ayesha Lokubalasuriya currently attached to the Family Health Bureau who was involved in conducting the survey said that there was a cultural impact attached to bullying because the children are never taught that bullying was a bad habit that needed to be stopped immediately.
Although parents and teachers are aware of bullying behaviour, they dont know how to handle bullying situations or prevent bullying from happening. In many schools, teachers ignore bullying signs rather than exert the extra time and effort it takes to deal with bullying cases, she said.
According to Dr Lokubalasuriya, one of the reasons why bullying is such a problem in schools is because many children today do not know how to handle social situations.
Teaching children to treat the other equally with respect would help to limit the scope of the problem in future, she said.
This, she added was a defect in the current education system.
Our Nursery teachers are so very concerned about teaching letters and not values to the children. A change in that system would bring a change in society, she said.
She was of the opinion that the children from a younger age should be taught about resilience and conflict resolution.
Dr Lokubalasuriya said that some attitudes were culturally ingrained in children through their parents but this could be changed through a standard education system.
Her insights clearly proves that Sri Lanka is in need for an education system that teaches children values in order to see a better world in future. Daily, we read of actions and behaviours that show an absence of self-regulation and a lack of integrity, morality or any sense of social responsibility. And according to Dr Lokubalasuriya, a positive change can be expected only through restructuring the present education system.
With a vision for a safe, free and Equal world
Think Equal - is a non-profit organization with the aim of empowering change through education. Think Equal was started two years ago and Sri Lanka is the first country in the world to commit to its full implementation.
This project comes in as a complete package which would address concerns expressed by Dr Lokubalasuriya and the change that she wanted to see in the school system.
Think Equal initiated by Leslee Udwin, an award - winning film producer/ Director turned Human Rights Campaigner, is an initiative to introduce a new curriculum into schools around the world that will start teaching children values of life based on empathy, compassion and equality.
The aims to provide children a profound grounding in human rights, equality, empathy, peaceful conflict resolution, critical thinking, gender sensitization, emotional literacy, self - regulation and ethics. It will also provide children with a more holistic education that will begin in the first year of a childs entry into the schooling system.
Udwin said that they requested the Education Ministers and Heads of states to endorse Think Equal initiative and pledge their commitment to it.
Twenty eight countries have responded positively so far. Sri Lanka is the first country to commit to Think Equal programme in the world and they will be rolling it out in every school around the country from January this year, she said.
The programme will be implemented in all of Sri Lankas 19,000 preschools and over 10,000 national schools. Developed by a proficient team of experts including representatives from the UN, World Bank, as well as academic expertise from leading institutions including Stanford and Yale University, Think Equal works towards the vision of ending mindsets of discrimination through a transformative shift in systems of education.
Udwin believes that achieving these goals will make communities safer, healthier, stronger and more economically productive.
Improved attitudes and behaviors of children
Sectional Head of the Ladies College Colombo nursery Lalamani de Sayrah said early childhood education was the realm of peace building and added that she was happy to have included the think equal curriculum to their syllabus.
Children who are 4-5 years interact better with the stories. How to be good to people and kind. Its a very good programme. We wish we can start for the children beyond eight years as well, she said.
She added that it was after eight years that most of their true qualities are shown to the outer world and by starting this programme at an earlier age, it would make a change in the attitude of children.
Principal of La Petite Fleur House of Children, Galle Ruwini Nanayakkara said that this was a real need in a multicultural society and the children should be taught to respect others, irrespective of their race and religion.
Initially I felt that it is too advanced for three year old children. At the end I realized it was good to have started at a young age, she said.
Nanayakkara added that she saw a difference not only in the attitudes of the children but also of the parents.
Therefore, in February 2016 the programme commenced with 18 treatment schools - who have been teaching the curriculum and 27 - control schools - part of the programme but they do not teach the curriculum, in order to see the changes that the new curriculum has brought in children.
Niro Raddella who handled four treatment schools - L.P.F Ratmalana/ Bridge to Peace, Lunugamwehera, Diyathalawa and Zoa in Batticaloa said that she noticed many positive changes in the children.
She said they had a mirror in the classroom and they make the children look at it every day, through which they learn to accept who they are irrespective of their appearance.
There was a child who had a skin disease. She was afraid to go in front of the mirror or before the other children. We taught her it was okay to be different and with time, all the other children in the class easily became friends with her, she said.
She further said that they also have a Tales tools kit that helped the children find solutions to problems and added that some children asked her if they could take the tool kit home to stop their parents fighting.
Dilki Therumi Hewage, teacher at Royal International School Kurunagala said, when she started she had a feeling that she would not be able to do it as a majority of her students come from rural areas.
I thought this was going to be hard. For the first three or four weeks, it was hard. When I realized the value of it, I grabbed the idea and did it in my own way. By the end of November I saw a real change, she said.
Malshani Gamage, teacher at Musaeus College nursery said that the stories deliver fantastic messages and pointed out that usually social and emotional aspects of a child is never taught to the children.
The children who come to our nursery are from good family backgrounds. But these programs need to be done continuously and not stop at the nursery level to see better changes, she said.
Udwin explained that the programme consisted of four levels and level one with 140 lesson plans for 3-4 year olds and the 2-4 levels for primary school children has been completed.
Since education is the primary engine of progress, Udwin said that this was an initiative which sought to drive global change and create a new generation of global citizens in a sustainably safe, free and equal world.

Top sovereign wealth funds in Sri Lanka to explore investment opportunities
Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama, opened the two day Roundtable Investment Forum with Sovereign Wealth Funds(SWFs) in Colombo yesterday under the patronage of the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The Roundtable was an initiative by the Minister following his visit to the Global Investment Forum in Dubai during November 2017 and is jointly hosted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka and the Board of Investment.
He met several of these Funds in Dubai and they were enthused by the potential of Sri Lanka as an investment destination. The fact that so many SWFs accepted the invitation to participate in the Roundtable at short notice was a validation of our nations value proposition and its increasing attractiveness due to the current economic policies under adoption.
SWFs are entities that manage the national savings for the purposes of investment. Some of the countries that use SWFs have economies that are heavily reliant on one source of income, for example oil revenues in the Middle East.
The investments made through the SWFs are effectively a way for those countries to diversify and become less reliant on a single stream of income.
Other SWFs manage the income from taxes and state owned enterprises for the benefit of the future generations. SWFs often have US$100-300 billion of capital under management. The SWFs in attendance at the Roundtable included the Investment Corporation of Dubai, Kuwait Investment Authority, Khazanah Nasional Berhad Malaysia, Government Investment Corporation of Singapore (GIC), Temasek of Singapore, and the Korean Investment Corporation.
Minister Malik Samarawickrama commented that We have seen considerable recent investment commitments by the Chinese and it is encouraging to embark on this journey with other nations. We have always had strong trade relations with our friends in the Middle East and South East. It is opportune timing to have GIC and Temasek visit Sri Lanka ahead of the execution of the FTA with Singapore later this month.
Dr Chang, Senior Advisor of the Investment Corporation of Dubai said, Weve been to many such forums and not a single emerging country has been able to attract such a strong representation of global investors. This is a reflection of both the trust in the future of Sri Lanka, and the competence and capability of the current government. The forum will lead to a mutually benefitical long term relationship.
The roundtable program includes presentations on the Central Banks Sovereign Bond program, the Colombo International Financial City, the Public Private Partnership program and the Western Region Megapolis.

Toyota, Mazda pick Alabama  for $1.6bn US investment
The firms revealed last year that they planned a US joint venture, with production scheduled to begin in 2021.
At the time, President Donald Trump said the decision was a great investment in US manufacturing.
The choice for the factory location had reportedly been narrowed down to either Alabama or North Carolina.
One US media outlet reported that North Carolina missed out because it did not offer the supply-chain logistics the two firms required.
Tariff threat
The factory is expected to eventually produce 300,000 vehicles a year and employ about 4,000 people.
When contacted by the BBC, Toyota refused to confirm that Alabama had been selected, saying an announcement would be made in early 2018. However US media was widely reporting a formal announcement would be made on Wednesday.
The auto industry is one area where President Trump has been pressuring overseas companies to do even more manufacturing in the US.
Last year he said Toyota would face hefty tariffs on cars built in Mexico for the US market if they were made south of the border.
Research conducted by the BBC in November last year found that approximately 53% of cars sold in the US by the top six Japanese carmakers were made there.
The rest were made in Japan, Mexico, Canada, and elsewhere. (BBC)

Traffic tickets to personal addresses of traffic rule violators

Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the Police would launch a pilot project in February to sendtraffic ticketsto personal addresses of traffic rule violators.
The Minister, addressing the officers of the Police traffic unit today (11), said the new technology would be introduced to assist the Traffic police officers in their day to day work.
"We all know how they run into difficulties while doing their day to day work. Some even abusepolice officers verbally whenthey try to take action on traffic rule violators. Their videos go viral on social media. All this can be avoided if we use modern technology for the benefit of traffic Police officers who perform their duties despite many hardships," the Minister explained.
The Minister added that atraffic ticket will alsocome withaphotograph of the traffic rule violation as evidence and an explanation of the offence. "If the vehicle owner thinks he is not guilty, he canpresent his argument in courts," Ratnayaka said.
"I also instructed the IGP to take necessary measures to pay an allowance to traffic police officers working under difficult conditions. A portion of the money we collect from fines can be allocated for this. I will present a Cabinet paper seeking approval in this regard," the Minister said.
The event was organised to give a basic first-aid training to traffic police officers. It was held with the support of the Sri Lanka Red Cross Society.
The Minister said first-aid training to Police officers would help reduce the number of deaths caused by road accidents, on a daily basis.
"Some deaths occur as those who take the victims of road accidents to hospitals use wrong methods. This happens mainly due to unawareness. That is why decided to give a basic first-aid training to Police officers. Tuk Tuk drivers too will be soon given a similar training," Ratnayaka added.

A true all-rounder:  Meet ambidextrous spinner Kamindu Mendis
Every team wants an all-rounder, but finding one to properly justify the title is a tough thing to do; there are few players who could earn their spot in an international team with either bat or ball.
But Kamindu Mendis is rarer than all of them. Not only does he bat in the middle order and captain his country, he also bowls spin equally well with left and right arm, even changing mid-over on occasion.
When I was young and starting cricket, I just practised both with my coaches, he said. Usually I do [bowl left-arm to a right hander and vice versa] but it depends on the situation.
The innovation is something rarely heard of in cricket, to the extent that despite Mendis best efforts, confusion among the officials often reigns when he reveals his talent. I just tell the umpire and let the batsman know, he said. But sometimes they look at me like, what are you going to do now
Mendis ambidexterity doesnt extend to his batting, but the left-hander is more than useful with the willow  he has four half-centuries in U19 ODIs, and a high score of 68 against Pakistan, who Sri Lanka will face in the group stages of the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup 2018.
Despite, or perhaps because of his unorthodox method, Mendis has become a fixture in this form of the game for his country; should he play every game at this tournament, he will become Sri Lankas most capped player in Under 19 ODIs.
He thinks his experience should count for plenty. Playing in two World Cups is a great thing, he said. I think that experience can help me do more for my country and my team. The country is always looking to us, and I just want to do best for my country.
There isnt a facet of the game Mendis doesnt seem to enjoy, with captaincy also bringing him great joy. I enjoy working with my teammates and my support staff, he said.
Its very easy to work with them and Im proud to be captain of the Sri Lanka under 19 team. With that pride, we have the motivation to do something great for our country.
Looking to the future, beyond Under 19 cricket, Mendis doesnt envisage a need to specialise in one method of bowling or another. Bowling with right and left arm is not something any bowler has done in a full international before, but being unprecedented only serves to spur Mendis on, as it should. Hes truly unique, and deserves to be celebrated.  ICC

UPFA for a disciplined political culture - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that the SLFP led UPFA will spearhead efforts to create a political culture with high moral qualities and discipline in the country following its victory at the upcoming Local Government polls.
President Sirisena was addressing the inaugural rally of the series of public election rallies organised by the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) at Salgado Grounds in Anuradhapura yesterday afternoon.
I will not allow political representatives who get elected at the forthcoming election to plunder public money, engage in corruption or malpractices and become rich while forgetting the needs of the people he stressed.
The President said that one of the major reasons which contributed to the defeat of the former Rajapaksa regime in 2015 was the fraud, corruption and injustices committed by some of the members who served in the local authorities at the time.
No elected political representative has the right to misuse public money. I will always stand firm and take whatever action necessary to stop such acts, the President said.
Commenting on the clashes that took place in Parliament yesterday morning, the President said although two groups accused each other of thievery the public knew who the real thieves were.
While identifying the opening of the countrys largest multi-purpose reservoir at Moragahakanda as a victory of the people, he said it was sad to see those who did not allocate even a single cent for its development for five years, trying to take ownership.
Although various governments have promised to complete Moragahakanda during election campaigns, it was the present government which was able to make that promise a reality he added.
SLFP General Secretary Minister Duminda Dissanayake, UPFA General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, SLFP Vice President Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva, Ministers Susil Premajayantha, Anura Yapa and other UPFA leaders attended.

Was 19th A retrospective  or not, questions Rajitha
Whether the 19th Amendment was retrospective or not, was the question, said co-Cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday, as he explained questions regarding President Maithripala Sirisenas query to the Chief Justice on the length of his term.
The President was prepared for an election in 2020, but he had been told that he would have to stay on until 2021, said the Minister, addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing held at the Parliamentary Complex.
His inquiry was to clarify this question, he added.
Minister Senaratne noted that as laws in Sri Lanka were not retrospective, it was generally believed that the five year term proposed in the 19th Amendment would not apply for the incumbent, but would do so hereafter.
I suspect that this would be the opinion of the legal fraternity too, said the Minister.
When questioned whether the President was seeking a second term, he replied, If he wanted a second term, he would not have asked this question.
President Sirisena has asked for an opinion on the matter from the Chief Justice by January 14. The Chief Justice in turn, had written to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka to express their views on the matter. He also appointed a five judge bench yesterday to deliberate on the query and arrive at a decision.

The Greatest  Showman  was a risk
Hollywood actor Hugh Jackman has admitted his upcoming movie The Greatest Showman involved a great risk.
According to a report, Jackman revealed that bringing a musical to the big screen is notoriously one of the hardest things to do in Hollywood. I think just the climate of Hollywood was like, Theres just too many risks. Theres too much to do.
He added, I mean, there have been musicals, obviously- Les Miserables, Mamma Mia. But an original movie musical is really hard.
Jackman has had plenty of experience with musicals, both on screen and on stage.
A bad musical stinks to high heaven. But when a musical works, people are screaming and cheering. Nothing Ive found has matched it. By the end, as you take the curtain call, theres no sense youre in front of strangers. Its an intimacy you get thats more intense than you have with people youve known for many years. Its everyone coming together and opening their heart, explained Russo.
The actor believed the time was right to tell Barnums story.
The Logan actor shared, He created this world that no one had even thought possible. For me, he really epitomised the idea that your imagination is your limit in a time where things were very rigid and when the social position you were born into was the one you were stuck in.

## Title: Additional plutonium for nuclear weapons

North Koreas Yongbyon Facility:
Additional plutonium for nuclear weapons
Thermal imagery analysis of the Yongbyon Nuclear Scientific Research Center indicates that from September 2016 through June 2017:
* The Radiochemical Laboratory operated intermittently and there have apparently been at least two unreported reprocessing campaigns to produce an undetermined amount of plutonium that can further increase North Koreas nuclear weapons stockpile. This suggests batch rather than continuous processing of spent fuel rods from the 5 MWe Reactor during the period of analysis.
* Increased thermal activity was noted at the Uranium Enrichment Facility. It is unclear if this was the result of centrifuge operations or maintenance operations. Centrifuge operations would increase the Norths enriched uranium inventory; however, based on imagery alone, it is not possible to conclude whether the plant is producing low or highly enriched uranium.
* The thermal patterns at the probable Isotope/Tritium Production Facility have remained consistent, suggesting that the facility is not operational, or is operating at a very low level. This means, the facility is likely not producing tritium, which is an essential isotope used in the production of boosted yield nuclear weapons and hydrogen bombs.
* From December 2016 through January 2017, the thermal pattern over the Experimental Light Water Reactor (ELWR) was elevated. While that might indicate that the reactor was operational, the likelihood is low since the pattern does not appear in subsequent imagery over the last six months. It is possible that there are alternative explanations for the elevated pattern, for example, short-term activity at the ELWR such as the heating of pipes to prevent freezing. Regardless, any activity at the ELWR is cause for concern and bears continued monitoring.
* The 5 MWe Reactor has either been intermittently operating at a low-level or not operating. The notable exception to this was during December 2016 and January 2017 when thermal patterns suggests a higher level of operations.
Analysis
While commercial satellite imagery is now widely used to analyze important developments overseas, including in North Korea, thermal imagery can provide additional important insights. Landsat 7 imagery from September 2016 through June 2017 was used for this analysis, although heavy cloud cover precluded the use of imagery from last November and no night-time imagery was available for the entire time period of this study. A total of 19 images are available and of these, 10 were chosen with approximately one-month time intervals between them to provide a consistent periodicity for the analysis. Seven images were deemed too cloudy for analysis and thus werent considered.
Developments noted at key Yongbyon installations were as follows:
Radiochemical Laboratory
Examination of the thermal patterns associated with the Radiochemical Laboratory (reprocessing facility) show significant deviations from month to month. Concentrated heat patterns were observed with stronger temperature differences from the surrounding area between September to October of last year.
The thermal patterns then returned to lower levels until March 2017, when a distinct increase in thermal activity is observed that has continued through last month. These intermittent surges in thermal activity suggest North Korea has conducted batch rather than continuous processing of spent fuel rods from the 5 MWe Reactor.
It is typical to allow the spent fuel rods to rest for a while in cooling ponds to both cool and allow less stable plutonium isotopes (PU-238, etc.) to bleed off. These reprocessing campaigns do not necessarily occur immediately after spent fuel rods are removed from the 5 MWe reactor.
The June 2017 thermal activity coincides with an increase in activity noted in a March 2017 analysis based upon natural color imagery.
The thermal patterns at the Uranium Enrichment Facility were elevated during September and October 2016, then decreased in November 2016 and remained low until March 2017 when it increased slightly. It is unclear if the period of elevated activity from September through November was related to centrifuge operations or the maintenance activity that was observed during this period.
Experimental Light Water Reactor
The same elevated thermal patterns over the 5 MWe Reactor observed in imagery during December 2016 and January 2017 also extended over the area of the ELWR.
This was likely the result of steam being released into the air when the turbines adjacent to the 5 MWe Reactor were being run, operation of the 5 MWe Reactor itself, mid-winter heating of both structures, prevailing weather patterns, or some combination of the above. We cannot completely, however, eliminate the possibility that this elevated thermal pattern was the result of short-term activity at the ELWR itselffor example, heating the structure to prevent pipes from freezing, allowing ongoing internal construction work, or pre-startup testing. [3] It is important to note that no other significant patterns of thermal activity were observed over the ELWR throughout the study period. Importantly, the ELWR did not operate at all from February through June 2017.
Any activity at the ELWR is cause for concern and its operational status bears continued monitoring as it would be an indicator of North Korean ongoing intentions and capabilities.
5 MWe Reactor
The thermal patterns observed at the 5 MWe Reactor remain relatively consistent with those observed in the previous report indicating either intermittent low-level or no operation of the reactor. There was a notable deviation in the December 2016 and January 2017 images, suggesting a period of higher level reactor operation that lends support to a previous analysis based upon natural color imagery.
Isotope/Tritium Production Facility: The thermal patterns at the probable Isotope/Tritium Production Facility have remained consistently low throughout the period under study, suggesting that the facility is not operational, or is operating at a very low level.

Airbus to increase aircraft production in China
Airbus has struck a deal to increase the number of planes it makes in China as part of a state visit by French President Emmanuel Macron.
The European giant aims to produce six of its A320 jets each month by 2020 at its final assembly plant near Beijing. During his three-day visit, Mr Macron said both France and China must open up to doing business with each other.
At present, he said, France has access to markets which is unbalanced [and] unsatisfying.
He told an audience of French and Chinese business leaders: If we don't deal with this responsibly, the first natural reaction will be to close up on both sides.
As part of the agreement, Airbus said it will enhance its industrial partnership in Tianjin which is one of four global facilities that assemble the A320 family of planes, whose wings are made in the UK. Airbus said it hopes to strengthen the cooperation with regards to technical innovation, engineering capabilities and supply chain expansion.
Airbus currently produces four aircraft a month at the facility but said this will rise to five by 2019 before reaching a monthly turnout of six jets by early 2020.
The company is one of a number of businesses travelling with Mr Macron on his first state visit since being elected last May. He has called on Europe to take a more coordinated approach to trade with China. Mr Macron said that in the past, countries had come to China with different agendas and varying degrees of openness.
We need a coordinated European approach... that gives China more visibility about our agenda, Mr Macron said.
That's why France is in favour of defining strategic sectors where we want to protect investments... It's a question of sovereignty as you yourselves have understood very well.

Anyone can freely express views now - Akila
Today anyone can express any opinions without fear due to the change brought by the 'Yahapalana' government, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
"It is like a stage drama when corrupt politicians of the past regime distort the facts through the media. They enjoy the opportunity to talk freely today due to the change created by this government, he added.
He further said that people who rode bicycles earlier are now billionaires. People who defaulted from bank loans earlier are now speaking like saints.
He said only the Court can decided who is guilty or who is not guilty. Several Ministers in the government have resigned from their posts even though they have not yet been found guilty by any Courts of law.
"The previous regime had many issues with regards to media freedom, especially murder of Lasantha Wickrematunge and attacks on many journalists like Poddala Jayantha. Since the Yahapalana government had assured drastic changes, we have not witnessed any incidents related
to any attacks, assassinations, abduction, threatening of journalists and setting fire to media institutions, he said. However, that media has not given adequate publicity for the massive social and development transformations achieved by the 'Yahapalana' government during past three years.
Minister Kariyawasam was speaking on the occasion of the opening of the new office of the Jathika Sevaka Sangamaya (JSS), in the premises of the State Mortgage and Investment Bank in Kollupitiya.
He added that the State Mortgage and Investment Bank which was set up during the Donoughmore era is now occupying a leading role among Sri Lankan banks. The bank should further develop its branch network to provide efficient service for the people living in remote areas.

Asian liquidity stress  indicator improves - Moody
Moodys Investors Service says that its Asian Liquidity Stress Indicator (Asian LSI) fell to 26.2% in December 2017 from 26.4% in November and 30.3% at the end of 2016, signifying an improvement in liquidity for high-yield companies in Asia in December and from the end of 2016.
The Asian LSI measures the percentage of high-yield companies with Moodys weakest speculative-grade liquidity score of SGL-4 as a proportion of high-yield corporate family ratings.
The indicator increases when speculative-grade liquidity deteriorates.
Although Moodys Asian LSI reading remained above the long-term average of 23.1%, highlighting ongoing weakness in liquidity for many companies in Asia, the December figure also marks the strongest year-end reading since December 2014, says Brian Grieser, a Moodys Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.
Moodys analysis is contained in its just-released monthly report titled Asian Liquidity Stress Indicator: Asian LSI improves to 26.2% in December from 30.3% at year-end 2016.
Rated high-yield issuance totaled $0.6 billion in December, raising year-to-date issuance to a record $34.5 billion.
The previous high was $23.3 billion in 2013.
The liquidity stress sub-indicator for South and Southeast Asian high-yield companies decreased to 23.1% in December 2017 from 26.2% at December 2016.
The Indonesian sub-indicator decreased to 22.2% in December 2017 from 26.2% in 20
The Chinese sub-indicator improved to 29.1% in December from 34.3% in 2016, while the high-yield Chinese property sub-indicator weakened to 23.4% compared to 20% in December 2016.

Australia to help control dengue in Sri Lanka
The Australian Government has come forward to provide financial aid to implement a biological control programme to control dengue in the country.
The Minister of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne received Cabinet approval to use the Wolbachia bacteria to biologically control the spread of dengue.
The Monash University in Australia had already conducted trials into Wolbachia and have found that when introduced to the dengue vector; Aedes aegypti mosquito, it stops the vector from transmitting the dengue virus to humans.
In 2017 alone, dengue had caused over 400 deaths in Sri Lanka.
Biological control methods are more environmentally friendly than fumigation methods and are more effective than trying to control all mosquito breeding sites. The Cabinet paper on the subject had also noted that the bacteria had been successfully used in Australia, Vietnam, Indonesia, Brazil and Colombia.
The pilot project would be started in Colombo.

PM INFORMS PARLIAMENT :
Bonds from 2008- 2014 needs further probe
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said he intends to discuss with the Parliamentary Public Finance Committee Chairman shortly, about the bond issuances from 2008 to 2014.
He said it was surprising that the COPE Committee had approved Central Bank financial reports during that period.
He said this in parliament yesterday during the special session convened yesterday to discuss the final report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) into the Bond Issuance of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka during the period from February 1, 2015 to March 31, 2016, which was handed over to President Maithripala Sirisena on December 31, 2017.
He noted that the President and he are committed to establishing a new political culture in this country steering it in a democratic and fair path.
The President stated that it was noted in the Presidential Commission report that an investigation was necessary to scrutinise the financial misappropriations of the Treasury bond issuances during 2008 to 2014.
The Premier added that he had advised relevant officials to investigate these embezzlements expeditiously and take measures to punish the perpetrators.
The majority of the bond issuances from 2008 to 2014 were done as direct private placements.There was absolutely no transparency. During this period bonds to the tune of Rs. 5,147,751,210,000 had been issued while of this amount bonds to the tune of Rs.4,702,232,210,000 had been issued as direct private placements. None of these transactions had received the approval of the Monetary Board.
Following is the full statement made by the Prime Minister:
The President made a special statement on January 3. Today I want to clarify further the Committee on Public Enterprises report or the (COPE) report.The initial dialogue on the Treasury bond issue was initiated in March 2015. As soon as I was informed about this, I appointed a three member committee comprising Attorney Gamini Pitipana. On March 31, 2015, I informed this council. The Pitipana Committee investigated this issue and reported to me.This commission recommended that further investigations were required. This report was tabled in parliament on May 19, 2015. On May 21,2015 we debated this issue in parliament and later it was submitted to COPE.
Thereafter, the COPE Committee headed by MP Sunil Handunnetti, commenced investigations. Through the COPE Committee too, investigations continued into this incident. On October 28, 2016 the COPE Committee report was tabled in parliament. Subsequently, on January 24, 2017 this was debated in parliament.
Meanwhile, on October 31, 2016, this report and the special Audit report presented to the COPE Committee by the Auditor General were both forwarded to the Attorney General by me through the Speakers Secretary. Subsequently, through the Prime Ministers Secretary, I sought the advice of the Attorney General on whether the Central Bank Officers had committed some fraudulent activity and acted beyond their delegated responsibilities, if the Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran should be held responsible, and if so what the legal measures are that could be taken against them, based on the recommendations of the COPE Committee.
Accordingly, the AG has appointed a special committee comprising members of the Attorney Generals Department to act in this regard. The Attorney General had notified us in writing in this regard.
Further, the Central Bank Governor notified me that there was suspicion of misappropriation of funds of the EPF. Hence, I notified the Central Bank Governor to seek the advice of the AG and conduct an inquiry. Accordingly, the Central Bank Governor had conducted an investigation and on June 9, 2017, handed over its report to the Auditor General.
In addition, I inquired in writing from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank on the Treasury bond issuance mechanism and of the losses incurred by the Central Bank bond issuance. However, they notified me that they were not aware of an internationally accepted mechanism to determine a previously issued bond auction loss.They said the losses or gains are determined by the market factors on the particular day that the bond auction was held. I have tabled a copy of the letter sent by the World Bank Sri Lanka Director on December 7, 2016.
Since March 2015, our government has taken appropriate measures regarding this issue. All details have been submitted to Parliament, COPE Committee and the Attorney Generals Office. In addition the President appointed a special commission, which uncovered further details. Now the report has been submitted to the Attorney General.
Meanwhile, on November 7, 2016 the Monetary Board issued an order limiting the operations of Perpetual Treasures Pvt. Ltd and prevented the companys funds from being taken out. On July 06, 2017, all their business activities were banned. On January 05, 2018 the ban on Perpetual Treasuries was further extended by six months. Accordingly, Rs. 12 billion of Perpetual Treasuries is being held in the custody of the Central Bank. According to the Presidential Commission report, the loss inflicted on the Central Bank in this transaction is Rs. 11 billion. Now what remains to be done is for the Attorney General to initiate the required legal action in order to recover the losses caused to the government through this transaction. Through this the government too could recover any losses incurred.
This is the first time in Sri Lankas history that such an investigation was carried out in a fair, unbiased and expeditious manner. This is a very complex investigation process. This is a special victory for the government we established on January 8, 2015. We were able to once again bring the countrys financial control under the supervision of the parliament, after ten years. During the past, parliament was unaware of any such transactions. To say the least, not even the relevant ministers nor responsible officers were aware of certain transactions. But, fortunately we were able to change that situation.
The President further stated that it was noted in the Presidential Commission report that an investigation was necessary to scrutinise the financial misappropriations of the Treasury bond issuances during 2008 to 2014. I have adviced the relevant units to investigate these embezzlements expeditiously and take measures to punish the perpetrators.
The majority of the bond issuances during the period 2008 to 2014 were done as direct private placements. There was absolutely no transparency. During this period bonds to the tune of Rs. 5,147,751,210,000 had been issued while of this amount bonds to the tune of Rs. 4,702,232,210,000 had been issued as direct private placements. None of these transactions had received the approval of the Monetary Board.
The Finance Minister at the time should make a statement in parliament regarding this matter. We the representatives of the people, as well as the general public have the right to know about these transactions.
We continuously worked towards strengthening the financial control of the parliament. We have constantly reported to parliament on the countrys financial status. Following that same policy, I reported all matters to parliament.
I intend to discuss with the Chairman of the parliamentary Public Finance Committee regarding the bond issuances during the period 2008 to 2014. It is indeed surprising that the COPE Committee had approved of the Central Bank financial reports during that period.
Today the Treasury bond issue has become a political issue. This bond issue has become a fine goldmine for the various media, political parties and mudslinging factories. Some claim that due to the Treasury bond issue the countrys interest rates had increased, while others claim that the dollar rate had gone up. But lets not get mislead by all these mudslinging campaigns and seek the truth. By uncovering the truth lets take the appropriate measures.
As I have reiterated, the President and I are committed to establishing a new political culture in this country. This is a new experience that is complex and hard for those parties who attack each other in political vengeance, to fathom. As the experience is unfamiliar, there could be inadequacies and wrongs that occur, but we must correct them and move forward.
However, no matter what, we are not prepared to sweep everything under the carpet and trample the rule of law, as the previous regime did. We are not prepared to bury social equality.
On January 8 we inherited a country that was caught up in a debt trap. A country that had no law and was engulfed in corruption and fraud. A country kept in fear over state terrorism.
President Maithripala Sirisena, myself and our government have steered the country on a different path.That path is arduous and treacherous. But we are committed to establish a just and democratic country evading all potholes and booby-traps obstructing our path.

Cabinet approval granted for import of frozen coconut kernel
Cabinet approval had been granted to import frozen coconut kernel to Sri Lanka.
The proposal was forwarded to the Cabinet by Plantation Industries Minister Naveen Dissanayake.
Accordingly a ship from the Philippines carrying the first stock of imported frozen coconut kernel, reached Sri Lanka yesterday.
The stock would immediately be distributed among the local coconut product industries, the Ministry of Plantation Industries said.
Local coconut kernel related industry owners have received the license to import 78,000 MT of coconut kernel, the Plantation Industries Ministry also said. Accordingly, stocks of coconut kernel would be imported in the coming weeks as well.
The annual coconut harvest which is about 3,000 MN of which 60 to 70 percent is used for direct consumption. The Plantation Industries Ministry observes that the rest was insufficient for industrial purposes.
These imported stocks would be re-exported to the World Market after turning them into finished goods.
The Ministry also expects it to be a solution in gradually decreasing the high price of coconuts in the local market as well.

California mudslides death toll rises with 13 still missing

Hundreds of rescuers are combing wreckage in Southern California for more than a dozen people missing after mudslides that have killed 17 people.
Another 28 injuries have been reported in Santa Barbara County following the deluge that overwhelmed an area scorched by wildfires last month.
More than 100 homes were destroyed, and another 300 have been damaged. Santa Barbara County Sheriff Bill Brown said 13 people remain missing.
The death toll rose on Wednesday afternoon after two more bodies were found, he added. More than 50 people have been rescued already but many places were still inaccessible.
Several roads were closed, including the major Highway 101 which authorities say will not be reopened until Monday. "We are still very much in active search-and-rescue mode," said Chris Elms, a spokesman for Cal Fire, cautioning that the death toll may still rise.
"That's a fear. We are still very hopeful that we will locate people alive," he added.
Santa Barbara County spokesman Amber Anderson said: "We have no idea where they're at. We think somewhere in the debris field".
The first rain in months caused mudslides when it hit ground that had been burned by December's huge wildfires.
After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption.
Together with the loss of vegetation, this leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency says the risk of flooding stays "significantly higher" for up to five years after a wildfire.
"Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible," said the National Weather Service in a statement.
In some places mud was waist-deep, officials said. Thousands had to leave their homes, many for the second time in two months. The emergency services declared an exclusion zone, saying anyone moving around the area would be in the way of rescuers and would be subject to arrest.
Those who have stayed in the area have been warned to boil their tap water before drinking it. Heavy rain run-off caused a mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked off their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason.
County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito, possibly as a result of the storm.
The US Coast Guard has sent "multiple airships to support rescue operations" and warned the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights would be grounded.
This comes after a record-setting year of $306bn (226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costs in the United States, with 2017 the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. California has suffered severe drought in five out of six of the past years.
In December, California Governor Jerry Brown said the state was "facing a new reality" as climate change meant wildfires could erupt "every year or every few years".

Ceylon Tea back to Russia
The Russian Federation revealed that its historic longing for Ceylon Tea has not wavered and even vowed for bigger trade with Sri Lanka, calling to despatch a strong delegation to the trade meet scheduled in Moscow this year.
Yes, we imposed a ban on Ceylon Tea, but it was nothing to do with our asbestos but was only about an insect found in a Tea package from Sri Lanka said Ambassador of the Russian Federation Yury Materiy on 9 January after meeting the Minister of Industry and Commerce of Rishad Bathiudeen in Colombo.
If we connected Ceylon Tea exports issue with Sri Lankan imports of Russian asbestos as widely speculated, then our tea ban would have to continue even now, isnt it asked Ambassador Materiy.We are not speaking about asbestos in general but only about Russian Chrysotile which is not harmful. Lots of investigations have been done on it.
Russian workers who have been working in the chrysotile industry for the last thirty years are doing fine-not one worker was reported to have had cancer in the last thirty years. There are many workers who handle chrysotile in the mines with bare hands, and they are fine.
Sri Lanka has been among the leading buyers of asbestos in the world. In 2015, the four leading asbestos importers in the world were India, Indonesia, China and Sri Lanka (buying from all asbestos exporting countries). Sri Lanka absorbed 6% of global asbestos imports in 2015. According to the Department of Commerce, Iron & steel, wheat and asbestos have been the three leading imports from Russia to Sri Lanka in recent years.
Sri Lankas recent asbestos imports from Russia has been at low levels and has shown a declining trend -$ 33.87 Mn in 2014, $27.92 Mn in 2015 and $28.80 Mn in 2016. From January to August this year, Sri Lankas asbestos imports from Russia was only $ 13.57 Mn.
We want to strengthen relations with Sri Lanka further. Bilateral trade between both countries is still low and it is time we expand our trade with diversified products. We in Russia like to support Sri Lanka in development cooperation in sectors of energy and agriculture.
Sri Lankas total trade (both imports and exports) with the Russian Federation which was at US $ 435.83 Mn in 2015 declined to $ 381.71 Mn in 2016. This year in the January to August period, it reported a total of US $ 260.78 Mn.

They include a clause that both Apple and the Chinese firm will have access to all data stored on iCloud.
Apple said it had made the move to comply with the country's cloud computing regulations. iCloud accounts registered outside of China are not affected.
The Chinese cyber security rules, introduced in July last year, include a requirement for companies to store all data within China. The firm, Guizhou on the Cloud Big Data (GCBD), is owned by the Guizhou provincial government in southern China.

(UN)spoken English
Many English tutors do not really want to get their students to practise speaking in English at their so-called English classes, even if they are introduced as Spoken English or Conversational English classes. Everybody knows that there are too many English classes mushrooming throughout the island. But how many of the students of these classes are able to utter a few words in English
I personally have observed a few classes conducted at Kalutara and Panadura and found out that no teachers want to have their students to speak at least a few words during the lessons in English. No teachers encourage their children to talk in English while the lessons were going on. Is this the correct way to teach a language What those teachers do is, that their students are definitely supplied with attractively printed file-covers and well-designed lesson notes together with day-cards/calenders. These bogus documents do not really serve any useful service at all.
Students should thoroughly keep in their minds that a language is speech-based and it should, therefore, be spoken. As such, a language qualification should never be evaluated through certificates as it's never a paper-qualification.

Colombo hosts Bay of Bengal oceanography conference
Training more oceanographers and collect oceanographic data is vital to understanding unpredictable oceanic conditions which Sri Lanka experienced recently, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry Secretary Jagath P. Wijeweera.
He was addressing the inauguration ceremony of the 2nd International Conference on Oceanography in the Bay of Bengal, held yesterday at the Cinnamon Grand hotel in Colombo.
Speaking about the Cyclone Ockhi, which swept through the country on November 29th and 30th of last year, killing seven persons and destroying much property, the Secretary said that just prior to the onset of the northeast monsoon, depression developed in the ocean and transformed it into cyclone unpredictably.
"Monsoon intraseasonal oscillations are essential to understand and make predictions on rainfall and weather during monsoons, and have overarching repercussions on water resources, fisheries and water based disasters such as storms, flooding, landslides and droughts in the country, said the Secretary.
Addressing the occasion, Foreign Affairs Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam said that predictions of weather patterns are equally important for people who depend on agriculture, as well as the service industry.
"In recent times it has become unpredictable and sometimes devastating. Sri Lanka is an island nation. We increasingly think as an ocean country. What is happening in the oceans is very important to us for our own wellbeing security and for our future," he said.

## Title: Commitment to professionalism

Commitment to professionalism
World Economic Forum, in its 2016 report, The Future of Jobs, predicted that many skills currently deemed important may no longer be relevant by 2020. Almost half of the knowledge that students obtain from schools now will also be outdated by the same year. Education experts and employers agree that education systems are transforming much more slowly, compared with the drastic changes in skill-set demands. Discussions on youth, technology and economic growth are expected to pervade national and regional discourse and influence government decisions.
The Singapore experience is that the top third in each cohort are recruited for the teaching profession. This raises the basic standards of educators as well as contributes to a strong cultural regard on educations importance within the larger society.
The professionalism of the teaching cadre in the primary and secondary education is important in setting a high barometer for the societys expectations in education aims to enlighten science-talented youths. This could be accomplished through discussions and dialogues with top scholars and technologists in the world. It invariably promotes the international friendship and cooperation among the best young students of the next generation in Asia. Further, professionalism in Academic cadre also important in setting a high standard for expectations of youth.
Strategies are also needed to excite and retain the trained teacher as well as trained Academic within the educational field. While Professional Development is an important goal to improve pedagogies and the self, Career Development is the complementary policy to meet a teachers longer-term career aspirations.
Singapore adopts a three-track system for all classroom teachers to head into: teaching, leadership, and the specialist. Each track is important in larger education ecology.
Next to teachers, school and university leaders are crucial to developing schools and universities as learning organizations, contributing to teacher satisfaction and enhanced student learning outcomes. School leadership, identified as the second-most important factor within schools to improve a students learning outcomes. Similarly, leadership in higher education is also important in improving students learning outcome.
When a leader is not appointed within the system the passion for the development deteriorates due to lack of understanding of the basic foundation of the system. Visionary leaders are essential in secondary and higher education sectors to improve futures orientated strategy in any country.
Sri Lankan leaders in many of these sectors lack Integrity, Professionalism, respect for diversity and a strong commitment to the mission. Therefore, it drastically affects the development process. Consistency and continuity of reform measures in education are needed without political interests.
Synchrony in ideas and practices
There is a distinct need to consider synchrony on multiple levels: horizontally and vertically. Horizontally, for any educational reform to be successful, a whole-of-government approach is needed that ties the ministries of education, manpower, national development, and finance, etc. closer together. One of the key components contributing to the success of many countries is the tight integration and link between education and economic development. Education has always been for a larger purpose within society and the economy. Comprehensive economic master plans attempt to forecast trends in the labour market, and the identification of skills gaps amongst the next generation of workers, have been the foundation for the push to develop students with the necessary skills and knowledge.
Holistic understanding of development
I think that a genuinely holistic understanding of development has to give as much attention to its cultural aspects as to its economic, political and technological ones. Infrastructure is not much use if there is nowhere to go with it! Education has always been for a larger purpose within society and the economy. Many development practitioners and social theorists have noted that any development process has an important cultural component. Efforts to improve quality of life or reduce inequality, for instance, are inherently tied to local customs, values and social systems.
Accordingly, research has found that culture can foster development as well as hinder development outcomes. Thus, it is important that development planners take cultural considerations into account, as benevolent interventions made without attention to cultural conditions and factors may prove futile or even have unexpected adverse effects. After the post-colonial era countries shifted the focus of education from meeting colonial needs to increase access to education.
Sri Lanka is still struggling with increasing the access to education as well as higher education due to a limited number of well-established schools and universities. In order to increase the efficiency in the Industrial economy expansion of universities and polytechnics were taken place in many countries. Countries have introduced streaming to reduce attrition and improve system efficiency. In a knowledge economy stronger focus was given to high value, higher productivity industries and the emergence of a service economy. Education had to focus on thinking in a knowledge economy. Countries have adapted Teach less-learn more frameworks.
In an entrepreneurial innovation and competency-based economy emphasis were given to adapted skills and 21st century competencies. Dynamic economic futures demand student competencies tackle new challenges. Emphasis on more holistic student outcomes. And the introduction of skill future initiative is important at this phase. Close linkages are important during each of the three phases of economic development.
Ministries of Education, Trade & Industry, and Manpower
Successful use of education for national development has been a key variable in the success of many countries. In many of the countries whole-of-government perspective prevails across the Ministries of Education, Trade & Industry, and Manpower.
Students are taught for individual development, but they are also crucially shaped for participation in the market. This horizontal partnership across the government demonstrates the tight link between education for economic and national development.

Enough is enough
A group of UNP parliament backbenchers met Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the other day at Temple Trees, to air their collective anger against certain private media who they claimed were on a big time smear campaign against him (Wickremesinghe). They stated that the vile propaganda against the UNP leadership was rising in tempo with each passing day due to these attacks going by default without being countered. They prevailed on the PM the urgent need for taking legal action against these private media houses before more damage could be caused.
The ire of these MPs can be understood. It is they who have picked the candidates, from their respective areas, to contest the upcoming Local Government Election and in the event of these candidates faring poorly at the poll, they (the MPs) would have to answer for not selecting the right candidate. They, therefore, naturally are in a predicament due to this frontal assault launched against the UNP leader. The voters, they feel, are not going to take kindly to candidates of a party whose leader is being accused of all things under the sun, especially when that leader continues to remain silent against this onslaught. As they say, the lie repeated over and over again assumes legitimacy ala a Goebbels particularly when relayed over a powerful medium such as Television.
True, as a true liberal democrat the Premier may have hearkened to the concept of live and let live. He has never known to have taken legal action against any private media in his political life amidst the most base and gutter campaigns carried out against him as a Presidential candidate. Nor has he responded to any of the allegations leveled against him by the media, though he has been critical of certain mediamen.
However, things appear to be getting out of hand. A certain private television channel is today manically focused on slandering the Prime Minister. Large portions of its news segments are being set apart for these attacks. Known critics of the PM are interviewed, with full tosses bowled to elicit replies that cause the maximum damage to the reputation and personnel integrity of the Premier. A Buddhist monk well known for his virulent anti-Ranil sentiments is the latest individual to be roped in by this channel to slander the Premier. He (the monk), obviously heavily bribed, now makes a daily appearance on this TV channel to lambaste the Prime Minister with language that seem totally inappropriate for a personage donned in the saffron robe.
What the public at large are unaware is that Premier Wickremesinghe has been at the receiving end of this channel since the day he refused to entertain a bid for a lucrative government contract by the owners of this channel. No one in the UNP, let alone the Premier, has brought this fact to the domain of the public, leaving the symphony to go on unchecked.
It is time the party acted to expose the hidden motives of this channel in attacking the Prime Minister. It is not just the LG candidates who are going to suffer the consequences. The UNP backbenchers who made representations to the PM for a tough response, too, are going to fall victim some day when General Elections are called. Hence, their appeals are as much for themselves as for the LG candidates they have put forward.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe cannot afford to ignore these insults. It is going to cost him personally as well as his party on the long run if he chooses to do so. There are plenty of legal options available to deal with the situation. As D'day draws near there is bound to be an escalation of these attacks, with other channels backed by the Rajapaksas too joining the party. Already these channels are busy giving wide coverage to pro- Rajapaksa Bikkhus who are enjoining the public to treat the mini-poll as a referendum against the government. A TV presenter hosting a morning show to convey the news of the daily newspapers is offering his own interpretation of events, to portray the government in poor light. Crowd pictures of Rajapaksa rallies are being doctored to magnify the attendance. It is moot whether the state run channels are doing enough to provide the other side of the picture, with the same enthusiasm and dynamism.
Be that as it may, the Grand Old Party is today hemmed in on two fronts. It is being attacked by both, members of the SLFP faction in the Unity Government, as well as the pohottuwites. The guns of the JVP too are trained more on the UNP than any other party. All these attacks against the Greens are being given full play by certain private TV Channels who owe their existence to the Rajapaksas. Amidst all this, the UNP appear to be dormant, not even carrying out an effective campaign to counter the half truths and outright lies. What is more, it's parliamentarians are today pleading with their leader to hit back against the vile propaganda against him. That shows the extent to which the party has allowed the Opposition to steal the show.

First ever Pharma Zone in Sri Lanka becomes a reality
Local pharmaceutical manufacturers will now be facilitated with sufficient land and basic infrastructure facilities for manufacturing plants to produce pharmaceutical products locally, with a view to achieving the governments target of localizing production of essential pharma items to a value of 100 million US dollars, said the Health Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne.
He said this at a special event held at the Waters Edge on January 8, in which the State Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Corporation (SPMC) entered into an agreement with Pharma Zone (Pvt) Ltd, to build the first ever exclusive pharmaceutical manufacturing zone of Sri Lanka in Kalutara district with an investment of over 10 million US dollars.
The facility that encompasses 50 acres of land is a BOI project and its principals are Sultan Ibrahim, Sultan of Johor and Patrick Lim, a leading Malaysian entrepreneur.
The minister commented, We have reduced prices of drugs in the marketplace. A particular drug prescribed for high blood pressure that cost Rs. 2,900 per a packet is now available at Rs. 280. Similarly a pill for diabetes that was Rs. 215 earlier is now sold at Rs. 17.60. Panadol was reduced from Rs. 3 to 1.30/-. We have thus reduced prices of 48 pharmaceutical brands that include 402 drugs.
The minister said all these measures are taken in accordance with Prof Senaka Bibiles recommendations on a national pharmaceutical policy.
SPMC Chairman Dr Sayura Samarasundara said that with the completion of the Pharma Zone, envisaged to be in operation within one year, the Countrys dependency on imported drugs will soon become a thing of the past. The Zone will be run and administered by Pharma Zone, headed by Patrick Lim, while SPMC along with the health ministry will set standards and monitor quality.
The Zone will be run and administered by Pharma Zone, headed by Mr Patrick Lim Soo Kit, while the SPMC along with the Ministry of Health will set the standards and monitor quality.
Electricity, water, road infrastructure, security, waste water management, will all be provided to the companies operating within the Zone, and it is the intention of Pharma Zone to attract overseas investors to set up operations within the Zone as well. We will be marketing Pharma Zone regionally, said Lim.

First island-wide survey on Tuberculosis conducted in over a decade
A survey on the knowledge, attitude and practices regarding Tuberculosis (TB) among the general population in Sri Lanka has been conducted for the first time in twelve years. Health Ministry Secretary Janaka Sugathadasa said that the results from the survey revealed that the general public has an unfavourable perception of TB.
Addressing a workshop held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute (SLFI) in Colombo yesterday, Sugathadasa said that the low-income population of the country is most affected by the disease. But, he added, with over 100 years of experience, Sri Lanka should be able to eliminate TB soon. He said that communicable diseases such as TB, leprosy, HIV, dengue, and more need to be paid special attention.
The Director of the National Programme For TB Control and Chest Diseases, Dr. Kanthi Ariyaratne, said that it is prisoners, elders, and malnourished persons who are most vulnerable to TB. Currently, there are 26 chest clinics around the country where people can get tested for TB, obtain information, and receive treatment free of charge.
Health Ministry sources said that as per World Health Organization estimates, Sri Lanka had 13,000 new cases of TB in 2015, yet only 9,975 cases were identified. According to 2016 annual statistics, a total of 8,886 cases of all forms of TB, among them 648 deaths, were reported to the National Programme for TB and Chest Diseases.
The majority of TB patients are from the Western Province, especially from Colombo city. 65 in every 100,000 people in Sri Lanka have been infected by the TB Bacteria, the Health Ministry sources added.

Freezing machines halt chip bug patch
Microsoft has halted some patches for the Meltdown and Spectre chip bugs after AMD customers complained that the software updates froze their machines.
The flaw in computer chips affects billions of PCs, smartphones and tablets around the world.
Specific fixes for the bugs on Windows 10, Windows 8.1 and Windows 7 had caused some machines to suffer blue-screen errors, Microsoft said.
In a blogpost, it said it was working with AMD to resolve the issue.
Microsoft said that it would resume fixes as soon as possible.
To prevent AMD customers from getting into an unbootable state, Microsoft will temporarily pause sending the following Windows operating system updates to devices with impacted AMD processors at this time, Microsoft said in the post.
It added that some AMD chipsets do not conform with the documentation previously provided to Microsoft.
AMD had previously said that the Meltdown bug did not affect it and that issues with Spectre could be resolved with software updates.
AMD is aware of an issue with some older generation processors following installation of a Microsoft security update that was published over the weekend, it said in a fresh statement
AMD and Microsoft have been working on an update to resolve the issue and expect it to begin rolling out again for those impacted shortly.
The discovery of two major flaws in computer chips have forced Apple, Microsoft and Google to rush out fixes for devices and operating systems.
Meltdown is currently thought to primarily affect most Intel processors manufactured since 1995, while Spectre affects chips made by a variety of manufacturers including Intel, AMD and ARM.
In a keynote address at the CES technology conference in Las Vegas, Intel's chief executive Brian Krzaich said 90% of its processors and products from the last five years would be patched within a week.
Most experts agree that patching Spectre is going to be harder and take longer. (BBC)

Global economic growth has peaked, says World Bank
Global growth appears to have peaked, with demographics, a lack of investment, a slowing in productivity gains and tightening monetary policy placing limits on economic expansion, the World Bank said.
The worlds economic output grew 3 per cent last year as more than half of economies accelerated, thanks to a rebound in investment, manufacturing activity and trade, bank economists said. The global economy is expected to maintain that rough growth level through 2020. But that may be as good as it gets, according to the banks annual report on the state of the global economy.
The problem facing the world is that after years of recovery from the 2008 financial crisis, most advanced and developing economies have closed the output gap between actual and potential economic growth.
Moreover, it is hard to see that changing unless governments embrace the sort of reforms and investment drives that the bank and other institutions have been demanding for years. If you step out of the snapshot [and look at<U+2009>.<U+2009>.<U+2009>.<U+2009>the historical progression<U+2009>.<U+2009>.<U+2009>.<U+2009>what you actually observe is that, while the growth is real and welcome, the potential growth of the global economy is going to be somewhat limited in the future, Shantayanan Devarajan, the banks senior director for development economics, said on Tuesday.
As a group, advanced economies are expected to slow in the coming years as they run up against full employment and as central bankers raise rates to contain inflation, according to the World Bank. Already, the bank said, it expected growth in advanced economies to slow from 2.3% last year to 2.2% this year and 1.7% by 2020.
But emerging and developing economies, which grew by 4.3% as a group last year, are also likely to hit ceilings and contribute less to global growth.
In many of the major emerging economies that have for years fuelled global expansion the underlying potential growth has fallen considerably over the past decade. It is likely to continue doing so over the next 10 years, the bank said.
That reality, the banks economists say, is the result mainly of long-term demographic changes. Countries such as China are seeing their labour forces shrink as populations age. That has coincided with slowing productivity growth.

Global growth back at pre-crisis levels, says World Bank
The bank's new forecast is that the world economy will expand by 3.1% this year before slowing slightly.
It will be the first time since the financial crisis that growth is operating at its full potential.
However, the report warns the upswing will be short term, with gains in improving living standards and reducing poverty levels at risk long term.
For the immediate future, the bank sees a reasonably upbeat prospect.
The bank's president Jim Yong Kim said: The broad-based recovery in global growth is encouraging.
The forecast is better than what the bank was expecting in its previous assessment last June.
Among the large economies, the up-rating is especially marked for the eurozone, though the bank still thinks it will slow somewhat this year, but by less than its previous forecast.
Long-term growth
Emerging and developing economies will grow slightly faster than last year in this forecast. However, the bank is worried about the longer term.
The issue is whether the world economy will have the capacity to maintain decent growth beyond the current upturn. Its potential is growing more slowly than it used to, the bank says.
That's the result of years of lacklustre improvements in productivity - the amount each worker can produce - weak investment and an ageing workforce.
This slowdown in longer term prospects is widespread, the bank says. It affects countries that account for about two thirds of global economic activity.
The fact that in the bank's view the economy is close to operating at full capacity means that there's little scope to stimulate further growth with the standard policy tools that work by boosting demand for goods and services - interest rate or tax cuts or increased government spending.
It says government should promote reforms to improve education and health services and infrastructure - such as roads ports, electricity supplies and telecommunications networks.
A healthier and better educated workforce is likely to be more productive, and better infrastructure makes it easier for business to be more productive too.
The weaker growth of the capacity of the economy is an increasingly persistent theme in the analysis of official economic agencies such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund. There are some marked variations in the forecasts between different regions. Africa and India are seen as likely to pick up a bit of speed this year.
China's slowdown, which began at the start of the decade, is predicted to continue, though with expected growth of 6.4% it's still strong. (BBC)

Goodbye dark elbows and knees
Pigmented areas are hard to clean by scrubbing with soaps as you will make the skin feel dry instead of making it look even.
If youre someone who is not much strict with their hygiene routine, then you are on the verge of facing this issue.
Friction is another reason. Surprised, right Yes, when the body faces any sort of friction in these areas they naturally build up a thick layer to protect the sensitive dermis in the underlying layers.
Sunlight is responsible for darkening of the skin. Dead cells absorb more rays and become darker. So, try covering your knees and elbows with more SPF.
Other factors include dry skin, obesity, genetic factors, hormonal imbalance, an increase of dead skin and melanin pigment secretion.
Tips:
Lemon


How can we talk about beauty care and not mention lemon As lemon has a great bleaching property which can make your skin shades lighter. You just have to apply it to the dark area and leave them for 10 minutes. Then rinse it with water. If you have a sensitive skin you can also add some rose water to it to dilute the solution.
Yogurt


Lactic acid is great for lightening the skin tone by moisturizing and cleansing the skin. All you need to do is mix the yogurt with some vinegar to make a fine paste. Now apply it to the affected area and keep it for 10 minutes. Rinse it properly with water and apply some moisturizer.
Sugar 


Scrubbing is a great way of removing dead cells. So instead of buying artificial cosmetics, it is better to grind some sugar and mix it with either olive or coconut oil. Now scrub that portion in circular motions for at least 5 to 10 minutes. Repeat this until the skin tone becomes lighter.
Baking soda


This gentle cleanser is very good in effectively removing dead cells and calm down hyperpigmentation. You will need one spoon of baking soda mixed with one spoon of milk. Massage the affected area in a circular motion for at least 3 minutes. Rinse it and try this method on alternate days for best results.
Exfoliating brush 


How to get rid of dark black knees
A loofah or the exfoliating brush can help you to easily remove dead cells from your knees and elbows. During shower just add some liquid soap to it so that you can easily clean the dirt and dead cells.
Coconut oil 


As coconut oil has a moisturizing and hydrating power so you can mix it with walnut powder and use as a scrub. It will add vitamin E to your skin and prevent dryness. It is an effective process as it easily lightens the skin by repairing it from within.
Hydrogen peroxide 


This is a medical method removing dead cells. You have to add 3% of this to your cotton ball and apply it to the area.
Keep it for 15 minutes and rinse it. As it has a bleeding property so it will clear out the dead cells. If you have a sensitive skin do not forget to dilute it with water.
Orange


For lightening the skin tone you can add some honey with the orange peel. They both act as a bleaching element. Make the paste and apply it to the area and massage them gently in circular motions for 15 minutes. Rinse it with water and try it for 3 times a week.
Apple cider 



The elements present in it is of acidic nature and hence acts as a bleaching agent. So, for exfoliating and lightening the skin dilute the vinegar with water and apply it with a cotton ball. Keep it for some minutes and rinse it.
These are some great ways of using basic kitchen ingredients to get rid of both dead cells and embarrassment. If you can dedicate 10 minutes, then with patience and time you can find no traces of these dead cells.

Hayleys Energy  offloads oil rig from  Brazil Trincomalee
Hayleys Energy Services, had successfully completed the offloading of the Semi-Submersible oil rig Olinda Star at the Trincomalee Port Anchorage recently. This deep-water rig is capable of drilling at water depths of up to 3,600 feet and has a drilling depth capacity of up to 24,600 feet.
The company was appointed as the exclusive service provider and Sri Lankan representative for the handling of the rig by the Brazilian Oil and Gas exploration and drilling services company, Queiroz Galvao Oleo Gas S.A.s (QGOG).
The rig was being dry towed from Rio, Brazil to Trincomalee Anchorage, Sri Lanka aboard Dockwise Mighty Servant 1, one of the worlds largest heavy lift carriers.
The Trincomalee Port Anchorage was selected for its ideal stable and safe sea conditions for offloading and loading such large Oil Rigs with the much needed deep sea depths, sheltered-calm waters and swing radius. Upon completing the safe and incident free offloading of the Oil Rig Olinda Star, the rig was towed from Trincomalee Port, Sri Lanka to Kakinda, India.
QGOG had contracted Hayleys Energy Services (HES) to manage all aspects of this Rig Offloading project in Sri Lanka, where HES had to coordinate and handle the project in close liaison with the Deputy Harbour Master of Trincomalee Port and Port Officials throughout this complex and challenging operation.
Speaking about the project, Director and Chief Executive Officer (CEO) of Hayleys Energy Services, Chas Charles said, Our experts have handled complex rig moves around the world as a 100% Sri Lankan Company since its inception, and it is indeed a noteworthy track record to see yet another safe and smooth rig offload carried out in Sri Lanka adhering to the industry safety standards and delivering timely results.The wide end-to-end service range provided by Hayleys Energy Services as a one-stop-shop, included the provision of three Tugs and supply vessels owned by Sri Lanka Shipping Company (a subsidiary of Hayleys Advantis Limited), coupled with the supply of bunkers & fenders, vessel provisions, crew transfer boats, unlashing/welding & engineering work, hospitality services, emergency response services and project management for the entire operation in Trincomalee.
Our teams knowledge and expertise in the Oil & Gas domain, clearly gives us a distinct edge over the rest in Sri Lanka and has today earned a renowned name for carrying out complex integrated Oil and Gas logistics services and projects with a 24/7 personal commitment to our international clientele.
It is indeed a landmark moment for us at HES to successfully conclude yet another incident free rig offload meeting the clients expectations.
We would like to thank QGOG for placing their trust in us and also appreciate the assistance offered by all stakeholders including the Sri Lanka Ports Authority, Sri Lanka Customs, Department of Immigration, Sri Lanka Navy and all other regulatory bodies in making this project a success, said Ricky Barnett, General Manager of Hayleys Energy Services.

How can Sri Lanka shape the Commonwealth beyond 2018
A landmark meeting of the leaders of Commonwealth countries will be held in London in April 2018. This presents Sri Lanka with an opportunity to play a key role in an international organisation that may have new relevance in the changing global order. In particular, Sri Lanka can work to promote intra-Commonwealth trade, womens employment and leadership, the empowerment of youth, and democratic values.
The Commonwealth of Nations may be more politically and economically significant in the post-Brexit world order.
While nationalism, populism, and isolationism and protectionism are rising globally, the Commonwealth could emerge as both a force for political stability and an engine of international trade, for Britain and the rest of the Commonwealth. Most of the Commonwealths 52 member countries share democratic values and institutions.
In addition, the Commonwealth Charter lists among its core values a strong rule of law, human rights, the promotion of sustainable development, and the strengthening of democracy. More informally, business ties and traditions also bind Commonwealth countries.
Upcoming CHOGM in April 2018
A Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) is held every two years. The bi-annual summit allows Commonwealth leaders to (i) review the dynamics of international politics and economics, (ii) strengthen cooperation among Commonwealth states through economic and diplomatic initiatives, and (iii) examine new avenues for Commonwealth states to cooperate in development.
Sri Lanka hosted the 23rd CHOGM in 2013 in Colombo, where Commonwealth heads of government adopted the Colombo Declaration on Sustainable, Inclusive and Equitable Development, and the Kotte Statement on International Trade and Investment.1 The 25th CHOGM will be held in London in April 2018, during which the UK will become chair of the Commonwealth from 2018-2020.
Opportunities for Sri Lanka at the 25th CHOGM
At the 25th CHOGM 2018, Sri Lanka could usefully promote four initiatives, each of which would strengthen Sri Lankas soft power and lead to useful economic and political outcomes.
(i) Facilitating Intra-Commonwealth Trade
First, Sri Lanka should push to examine ways to increase intra-Commonwealth trade. The coming implementation of Brexit means that Britain will no longer enjoy comparable trading arrangements as other EU members. Discussions on a future trade agreement between Britain and the EU are complex, and may eventually yield a limited free trade agreement (FTA).
The loosening of Britain-EU trade relations is a potential opportunity for increased trade within the Commonwealth. Commodities like tea, coffee, rubber, spices, metals, and minerals will continue to dominate intra-Commonwealth trade for the foreseeable future.
Trade in traditional services like tourism, banking, and insurance will also be prominent. These forms of trade will gradually expand after Brexit due to historic specialisation and demand conditions; a common legal framework of the common law; UK accounting practices; and the widespread use of English as a common business language.
CHOGM 2018 should give due recognition to the role of these institutions as a basis for intra-Commonwealth trade.
Moreover, a proactive approach will help promote trade in modern services, as the new frontier in intra-Commonwealth trade.
A host of exciting new services (including electronic commerce, information technology services, professional services, creative industries, green services, and services linked to global value chains) fall under this heading.
Sri Lanka at CHOGM 2018 could recommend a regular forum of the Ambassadors from Commonwealth countries at the World Trade Organization (WTO), to discuss regulatory barriers to the growth of modern services trade in Commonwealth member states.
The role of the Commonwealth Business Council should also be expanded to encourage business-to-business forums on modern services trade.
A future step could be a plurilateral trade agreement for modern services trade (or a few select activities) among like-minded Commonwealth countries.
(ii) Promoting Women in the Labour Force
Second, Sri Lanka should support at CHOGM 2018 womens participation and leadership in the labour force. The Commonwealth Women Leaders Summit acknowledged womens under-representation in many segments of the labour market, and the need for inclusive growth.2 Likewise, Sri Lankas Female Futures Forum recently promoted female leadership as entrepreneurs and in the private sector. Sri Lanka could propose establishing a forum of Commonwealth Female Business Leaders, as a key grouping within the Commonwealth Business Council (CBC).
This leadership initiative could act as a conduit between business and the government, promoting female participation in both sectors throughout the Commonwealth, while also promoting Sri Lankas soft power on gender issues.
Studies have shown that the presence of women in corporate leadership leads to positive firm performance. For profitable firms, a move from no female leadership to 30% representation is associated with a 15% increase in net revenue margin.3 Female corporate leaders contribute to superior firm performance through: (i) greater diversity of skills in management, and (ii) less gender discrimination in management, which helps with recruiting, promoting, and retaining talent. An initiative for Commonwealth Female Business Leaders, led by women corporate leaders around the Commonwealth, would ultimately facilitate sustainable growth and investment.
(iii) Empowering Youth
Third, Sri Lanka should wholeheartedly support a key focus of CHOGM 2018: youth empowerment and equality.
As Theresa May has said, Young people [will be] at the heart of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London.4 Approximately 60% of Commonwealth nations two billion citizens are under the age of thirty; however, youth account for 50% of unemployment globally.5 Given this overwhelming and risky demographic, Sri Lanka must address barriers to the growth and success of young people at CHOGM 2018.
As the Commonwealth Youth Forum that will be part of CHOGM 2018, Sri Lanka may wish to focus on how youth can become more deeply involved in policy-making, and how youth programmes can help combat current trends of nationalism, populism, and isolationism.
Furthermore, youth leadership should not be limited to occasional summits; CHOGM 2018 should examine how youth can engage with their parliamentarians on a regular basis, to present their voices and views on a range of issues. Youth empowerment will remain a hollow slogan without the highest levels of political commitment, as well as active and well-run schemes to implement that commitment.
(iv) Sustaining Democratic Values and the Rule of Law
Fourth, Sri Lanka should emphasise democratic values at CHOGM 2018. In a time when populism and authoritarianism appear on the rise, Commonwealth countries should publicly recommit to their democratic institutions.
This in turn can ensure a free and responsible media. Good governance and media freedom are mutually dependent; when the journalists can report freely, a nation can be confident that its decision-makers are held to high standards.6 Sri Lankas government amended the constitution in 2015 to promote democratic values, and recently guaranteed the right to access government information.
CHOGM 2018 is an opportunity for Sri Lanka to show its own commitment to democratic values, and to support cooperation among member states to make good on collective commitments, and ensure dissent is not handled with repression and violence.
Finally, at CHOGM 2018, member states should refocus on a key feature of almost all Commonwealth nations  the common law  and evaluate how it supports the rule of law. The Commonwealth aims to build, support and strengthen legal systems in member countries.
It promotes the rule of law to build lasting democratic institutions that enable citizen participation in local and national government. Independent judiciaries must be strengthened to protect fundamental rights and also, to enable business disputes to be resolved fairly and efficiently and an investment-friendly environment. In short, the legal realities of Commonwealth nations must be examined, to uphold both democratic stability and economic development.
CHOGM 2018 and the Future of the Commonwealth
There is little doubt that CHOGM 2018 should take a firm stance against the powerful forces of nationalism, populism, and isolationism that are at odds with Commonwealth values and traditions.
While the Commonwealth is unlikely to transform from a political grouping to a liberal economic organisation overnight, CHOGM 2018 can begin to blend the promotion of intra-Commonwealth trade with a reaffirmation of the importance of shared democratic values and institutions. Sri Lanka can make the case for marrying sensible economics with thoughtful politics, to tackle the challenges of a new and uncertain world order.

Human elephant conflict intensifies in Hambantota
As a result of clearing forest reserves in Hambantota beyond limits, elephants are being deprived of elephant corridors.
It was these elephants that were transferred to the Horowpathana elephant protection centre.
The wildlife officials at Hambantota said that only hardcore elephants that possess strong genes are sent to the Horowpathana elephant protection center. These elephants are those who are considered hardcore ones.
To increase the strong elephant population there should be enough she elephants at the Horowpathana center for the hardcore elephants. According to sources at the Horowpathana centre, there are only two she elephants at this center at the moment.
The Horowpathana centre is now similar to a prison for hardcore elephants as some of them transferred to this center die of attacks by other elephants, the sources said.

Kandys complete dominance floors Airmen
Defending champions and present table leaders Kandy Sports Clubs complete dominance in all phases of the game, helped them to record ninth win in a row when they beat Sri Lanka Air Force 64-12 at Ratmalana last weekend.
In the first fifteen minutes Kandy had 92 percent possession because Air Force ruggerites did not know what they were up to, and they persisted with their game plan of kicking for territory. By doing so they conceded what little ball they had. Kandy hammered home the advantage relentlessly, particularly at the breakdown where they absolutely dominated, with their back row which had previously proved it adept at turning over teams at the tackle. The real damage came off first phase, when Kandy used their fifteen to handle the ball well in the line-out to provide quick ball, and the willingness of the backs to take the ball completely flat shredded an Air Force defence which was of no use.
Kandy rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya the man behind the teams success said, Im very proud of the team. They have created history today to become the only team to beat all teams they met. Wijesuriya is the man who led the Kandy to be uneaten in all three tournaments, sevens, league and knockouts. We have the best 15 players they play a very good game of rugby and its another step forward for the team, he said.
Once the game kicked off, it was clear that Kandy wanted to play a high tempo game with the forwards; something that had worked well for them so far this season.
They went one step further though, and avoided being one-dimensional by swinging the ball wide at times, or shifting the point of contact in the forwards. The advances they have made in attacking prowess over the course of the tournament were certainly evident.
In defense, Kandy continued to work well, and while their line speed has been a key area for them through the buildup games, it was clear they were putting a lot of effort into disrupting the breakdown, ensuring the Airmen struggled to get clean ball. The game opened with Kandy in the ascendancy in both possession and territory, and it looked like the dismissal of the Airmen.
Kandy are left with five more games, and are sure to win all of them and keep the league title in the hills for another year. The rest of the matches are against CR & FC on Saturday 13 at Nittawela, 20 v CH & FC at Nittawela, 27 v Sri Lanka Navy at Welisara, February 3 v Army SC in Colombo, 11 February v Havelock SC at Nittawela. Kandy lead the table with 52 points in their nine games followed by Havelock SC with 36 points and Navy SC third with 34 points.

## Title: The kept word

The kept word
Last week, the focus of attention in political circles was President Maithripala Sirisenas special address to the nation regarding the report of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into the sale of Central Bank bonds and the possible political fallout from the issue.
The hearings of the Commission were held in public and received wide coverage in the print and electronic media. It had already led to the resignation of Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake who was previously Finance Minister, whose position in the Cabinet became untenable after it transpired that the rental for his apartment had been paid by Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) Director Arjun Aloysius who is a key person of interest in the inquiry.
In that sense, it was unlikely that there would be startling new revelations in the report of the Commission of Inquiry. Nevertheless, the Presidents address was much awaited in that it was expected to indicate what actions would follow- and the potential political implications of any such actions.
The President outlined the key findings of the Commission. It revealed that the loss to state institutions amounted to over Rs. 8.5 billion. The losses were incurred mostly by the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the Mahapola Scholarship Trust Fund, the National Savings Bank Fund and the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation.
The report has identified PTL, its Director Aloysius and its Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena as those responsible and recommended civil and criminal actions against all of them for losses caused to the government.
The Commission found that former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran has interfered in the bond issuances with a false and unconventional decision making process. It held Mahendran responsible for divulging confidential information to outsiders.
Bond transactions
The Commission has also recommended that cases be filed against Karunanayake under the provisions of the Bribery and Corruption Act and that action be taken against him under the provisions of the Penal Code for giving false evidence before a Presidential Commission.
The Commission found that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had done nothing irregular in appointing Mahendran to the post of Governor of the Central Bank, noting that Prime Ministers statements to Parliament indicated that he had reposed his trust in Mahendran. The report however said that the Prime Minister should not have done so.
In his address to the nation, the President pledged to recover the losses incurred from the bond transactions. The recovery could be done by following the normal legal procedure, but since it would take a longer time, the commission has suggested the presenting of a special bill to Parliament to bring about laws for the speedy recovery of the loss, the President said.
The President made use of the opportunity to address the nation to note that he had also received reports from the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud, Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC).
I have received 34 reports from PRECIFAC. I have recently received 17 reports. I have received 17 reports earlier. The reports that I have received were handed over to the Attorney General. Action will be taken in respect of these reports, President Sirisena said, noting that PRECIFAC had made several major recommendations and it is the responsibility of the government to implement them.
Prior to the Presidents address, there were several requests made to the President to publish the report amidst concerns raised mostly by the opposition that it may not become a public document. However, President Sirisena laid any such anxieties to rest, stating that it would be presented to Parliament and thereby be available for public perusal.
That the President chose to publicly announce the recommendations and endorse them in the strongest possible terms indicate that he intends to follow-up on the recommendations assertively. It will underscore the emphasis the government has placed on good governance and enable it to take the moral high ground.
Commissions findings
What is being keenly observed however is the impact this would have on relations between the President and the United National Party (UNP) where Ravi Karunanayake is one of its stalwarts.
At its 70th anniversary celebrations at Campbell Park earlier this week, the UNP provided with what might be construed as its response. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was quite categorical in his stance. He readily endorsed a call by opposition political parties to reconvene Parliament early to discuss the Commissions findings. He also suggested a forensic audit in relation to the Central Bank and requested that transactions in the Central Bank during the previous government be also probed.
Karunanayake meanwhile has protested his innocence and maintained that he is ready to face any proceedings. On Tuesday, he was at the Presidential Secretariat, requesting a copy of the Commission report under the Right to Information (RTI) Act, stating that he wished to clear his name.
Understandably, sections of the UNP are unhappy that the President has made a very public announcement regarding the findings of the Commission of Inquiry. Some of them accuse the President of deliberately timing his announcement, with an eye on the local government elections.
They are concerned that the Presidents statement will have a negative impact on the partys chances at the forthcoming polls. Indications are that the findings will not be favourable for the UNP, but the extent of this impact cannot be predicted.
However, if there was an expectation that the Presidents announcement indicated a parting of ways between the UNP and President Sirisena and the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) as hoped for by the Joint Opposition (JO), that has not materialised. The President and the Prime Minister were seen together in public at the openings of the Rajagiriya flyover and the Moragahakanda project on Monday and there was no hint that there was any discontent between the two.
National Unity government
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also used the third anniversary of President Sirisenas inauguration on January 8 to underscore the importance of the National Unity government continuing to work together. The allies of the government should get together in celebrating what we have achieved but we should also overcome obstacles before us when delivering what we promised to the people, the Prime Minister said.
As it is only to be expected, both the JO and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) will try to gain maximum political mileage out of the findings of the Commission. The JO however has a difficulty in doing so: it would have to necessarily acknowledge President Sirisenas role in taking the initiative to inquire into the sale of Central Bank bonds by setting up a Commission of Inquiry, thereby conceding that the government has been transparent on this issue.
Therefore it resorted to another tactic. JO stalwart and Chairman of the newly established Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) G.L. Peiris called for the removal of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe because, he argued, there cannot be a fair trial while the Prime Minister held office.
Of course, being a former Professor of Law, Peiris must know that it is the courts that conduct a fair trial and that under this government, unlike its predecessor, interference with the judiciary is not the norm. However his rhetoric indicates that the JO and the SLPP will try and milk the Central Bank bond issue for maximum political gain.
With less than a month to go for the local government election, it is the outcome of the poll that would determine the future political direction of the National Unity government. While the results of the election remains uncertain, what is certain is that Central Bank bond issue will be a prominent theme in the election campaign- particularly for the opposition.

Kodak soars on KodakCoin and Bitcoin mining plans
Shares in photo firm Eastman Kodak soared nearly 120% after it revealed plans to mint its own crypto-currency, the KodakCoin.
The US firm said it was teaming up with London-based Wenn Media Group to carry out the initial coin offering (ICO).
It is part of a blockchain-based initiative to help photographers control their image rights.
Kodak also detailed plans to install rows of Bitcoin mining rigs at its headquarters in Rochester, New York. Details of this second scheme - which is being branded the Kodak KashMiner - were outlined at the CES tech show in Las Vegas.
Customers will pay up-front to rent mining capacity.
Kodak is the latest in a series of companies to see its value jump after revealing plans for blockchain-related activity.
This is a phenomenon we saw back during the dot com days in the late 1990s where traditional companies would mention some kind of internet strategy and their stock price would jump up, commented Garrick Hileman from the University of Cambridge.
When you see stock prices moving like this it does appear to be troubling - it's hard to say if there's a bubble but it certainly is indicative of a frothy investment market.
Coin creation
Kodak was famously slow to join the digital revolution, and its hesitation to leave behind its film heritage cost the company its market.
Since its collapse in 2012, Kodak has licensed its brand to a variety of manufacturers, with the mark appearing on batteries, printers, drones, tablet computers and digital cameras.
The KashMiner operation will be run by Spotlite, a licensee that had previously teamed up with Kodak to use its brand to market LED lights.
Mining involves carrying out processor-intensive tasks to solve complicated mathematical problems in order to verify crypto-currency transactions.
Any Bitcoins generated by Kodak KashMiner will be shared between the customer and the business.
Each of the mining rig boxes - which include computer processors and fans to keep them cool - will use about the same amount of electricity as running a hairdryer around the clock. But the scheme will be able to take advantage of Kodak's on-site power generating plant, which has had spare capacity since Kodak's heyday.

The company says it can power each rig for four cents per kilowatt hour, which is significantly cheaper than running a rig at home.
At Bitcoin's current value, an up-front investment of $4,000 (2,954) for 24 months of mining could earn a profit of $500 a month, Spotlite's Halston Mikail told the BBC.
But anybody hoping to join the gamble would have to wait, as capacity is already sold out, Mr Mikail added.
At this time we have 80 miners, and we expect another 300 to arrive shortly. There is a big pile-up of demand, he said. Bitcoin is notoriously volatile and some analysts fear its value could crash, resulting in a loss for those who had paid up-front for mining capacity.
But Mr Mikail said the rigs could be put to work on other tasks if Bitcoin faltered.
Bitcoin could be a bubble. But the blockchain industry is not a bubble, he said.
It's a solid platform built on mathematics and it will survive.
Kodak currency
Kodak's other initiative, the KodakCoin, is being created as part of an effort to build a global ledger of picture rights ownership that photographers can add their work to.
Associated KodakOne software will be used to crawl the web and find pictures that have been used without permission.
The company said it would then manage the licensing process, so the photographer can be paid, in KodakCoin.
Kodak has always sought to democratise photography and make licensing fair to artists, said Kodak chief executive Jeff Clarke.
These technologies give the photography community an innovative and easy way to do just that.
The company's shares traded more than 130% above their opening price after the announcement before closing the day 119.4% higher.
But one expert had doubts.
Storing the information in a blockchain doesn't protect your copyright any more than copyright law already does, commented David Gerard, author of Attack of the 50ft Blockchain.
Notice how they're marketing it: they state a problem, then say the blockchain can solve it. But there's no mechanism by which the blockchain could do that.
This doesn't do anything that signing up for Shutterstock or Getty Images wouldn't.
Even so, some think Kodak will not be the last household name to associate itself with an ICO.
I expect we are going to see more major brands releasing their own tokens and currencies to support various products and services, commented Mr Hileman.
It's something many big companies are thinking very hard about. (BBC)

Major national reinsurance covers not renewed
Major national insurance procurement programs have lapsed as at December 31, 2017 and have not been extended or re awarded after expiry.
The National Procurement Guidelines rightfully provide that awards cannot be made pending the appeal, and it is very appropriate in instances like this where it is alleged that procurement guidelines are blatantly violated with intent to award at exorbitantly higher premiums, compared to the best bids said a veteran in the industry and founder-secretary of Sri Lanka Insurance Brokers Association (SLIBA) Upali Wickremaretne said.
However it is learnt that the state controlled entity NITF (National Insurance Trust Fund) has, with the approval of CAPC,MPC and cabinet approval for the 2017 reinsurance programs, an automatic one-month plus extension from December 31, 2017 on a prorated basis with the incumbent panel of reinsurers who in turn have already agreed to renew.
It is important to note that in April 2017 too such a non extension due to what can only be seen as sheer irresponsibility and male-fide intent of the officials at the Fund, affected the much applauded worldwide National Natural Disaster Insurance Scheme (NNDIS), which lapsed and was not extended in similar circumstances.
Meanwhile overseas companies are acting and holding themselves out as insurance brokers, when they are clearly not authorized to do so. These companies are not Registered Insurance and Re Insurance Brokers in Sri Lanka, as required by the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act No.43 of 2000, he said.
The said companies are not located in Sri Lanka nor have they the required license from the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka. All institutions seeking insurance broking services and covers should check their registration with regulatory bodies as required by law.
He also pointed out that any broker appointment made to such overseas companies is made illegally and contrary to the express provisions of the regulation and best practices of the insurance industry around the world.
Meanwhile industry association sources also showed extreme concern, on why when there is such a strict regime for registered brokers such overseas companies including fly by nights operate here unchecked. Sources said, They could run away, and there is no accountability for persons who are not registered in the country, as required by law.
These sources added, We will do our utmost to protect the industry and the interests of the large number of insurance brokers mainly with a view to safeguard the insured and public interest at large.

The Novel - Shaped Mind
If my stars had been kinder, I would have met Zadie Smith at the Department of Creative Writing, New York University, in 2010. But our paths were never destined to meet. As fate would have it, by the time she joined the faculty as a lecturer I had bid adieu to my graduate studies at NYU and returned home. Among all the contemporary writers that thronged the classrooms, escalators, cafes and streets around NYU, I so yearned to bump into Zadie (in her turban, thick-rimmed glasses and big trainers) because I found her alluring, not only as a novelist, but as an essayist and an advocate of the minimum-makeup movement (When I was growing up,' she once said, just the whole idea of being a girl  it seemed like a lot of work to me. Even now, I will wear lipstick and mascara but I will not do anything else. I wont do my toenails or my fingernails. I was terrible at dating because of what dating involves, the presentation of something). Plus of course, her revelation of the greatest lie ever told (more of this later) and her brave stance in the face of male critics who reviewed her books.
James Wood was one such critic. When he reviewed White Teeth, Zadie's debut novel, published when she was 24 which won many awards he accused her of writing about 'hysterical realism'. Zadie countered this by pointing out that particularly with girl writers male critics constantly wish to correct and improve. She said, The way male critics write about women is part romantic, part corrective, part, now listen young lady. And Zadie Smith was one writer who wouldn't have any of it lying down.
Author of four critically acclaimed novels  the first, White Teeth, which deals with the 50-year friendship between Archie, a working-class Londoner, and Samad, a Bengali Muslim, whose ill-fated affair with a white woman proves a catalyst for the novel's central events <U+2028> Zadie Smith's latest work is Swing Time, which focuses on 'two brown girls who dream of being dancers'.
Not surprisingly as with White Tiger, this novel too is based in North West London which is where Zadie's first home was, on the opposite side of the same street in which she owns a house now, a pretty, low-rise council estate called Athelstan Gardens in North London. Her mother, Yvonne Bailey, had moved to London from Jamaica at the age of 15, and then married Harvey Smith, who was white, British and much older. They went on to have two boys, Ben and Luke and divorced when Zadie was a teenager  a studious girl and precocious author of sonorous words (at 14, around the time her mother gave her Zora Neale Hurston to read, she changed her name from Sadie to Zadie).
She read, more or less, for a living, or instead of one, and was the first person in her family to go to university. (In her second year, at Cambridge she published a story in a student anthology, and later met the boy who had edited it, Nick Laird. They married in King's College chapel in 2004.) 'My mind is novel-shaped,' she once said in an interview with the Guardian, by way of explaining the way her imagination was trained. Her mother was a library zealot, and her father an autodidact. 'Pretty much the only place my parents' marriage could be considered a match made in heaven,' she said recently, 'was on their bookshelves.' Smith claims she was a large child, and 'invisible', which was probably why she was so studious. 'That's the problem with pretty girls, they never get anything done.' To this day, what confidence she has stems from this: 'the belief that once you learn to read, nothing is beyond you in its essence'.
'It's so funny,' she recalled in a more recent interview also with the Guardian, 'Nabokov, who I loved more than any other writer when I was young, had such contempt for dialogue. When I was younger I never wrote a word of dialogue because of him. I thought it was a childish part of a novel. I wrote White Teeth kind of feeling ashamed all the time. But now I think it's one of the few places where you can try not to manipulate. You can't know what's going on in somebody's heart or head  but you can listen, and write down speech. It's not honest or dishonest, it's just what there is.'
Adhering to this theory, offering few descriptions of her characters in her novels she implores the reader not to judge people on what they look like, and listen instead to what they say. There is a moment in Swing Time, for instance when a character makes her friends laugh because she has told a story many times and left out until the latest rendition what they consider to be a key detail: 'How could you not mention the headscarf!' they say. Zadie herself is doing something similar throughout her work.
'It's an existential point,' she explains. 'It's beyond politics. I decided the only race I was going to mention was white people, so anyone who's white is identified consistently. I suppose I want to show a world in which people who are not white are not determined by white people. And it proves to be incredibly hard to do that. You realize if you grow up black in England that to a lot of people here being black is in itself a political statement. But we're neutral to ourselves, you understand.'
Her own experience when it came to discrimination, she says, was always softened by her academic achievements, though she hints that this might have been through a desire to overcompensate in the face of prejudice. 'When I was little, we'd go on holiday to Devon, and there, if you're black and you go into a sweetshop, for instance, everyone turns and looks at you. So my instinct as a child was always to over-compensate by trying to behave three times as well as every other child in the shop, so they knew I wasn't going to take anything or hurt anyone. I think that instinct has spilled over into my writing in some ways, which is not something I like very much or want to continue.'
If Zadie has doubts about her abilities as a writer, she finds compensation in being part of a community of other writers. 'I think you have to be interested in literature in general, not just the stuff you happen to write,' she says. 'That's just one little window in a massive, extraordinary church.'
As with so many other women writers, the birth of her daughter Kit,inevitably, was life-altering for Zadie. 'Once you give birth you do feel a lot less scared of things. I was always so scared of everything. I think our generation had so much fear that it was all going to go horribly wrong, because we weren't taught about mothering, we were taught how to get an education,' she reflects. 'I was so surprised to find my daughter thought I was all right. I still can't get over it. She really likes me!'
She goes on to point out that the honest truth is that Eliot wrote without children, Woolf wrote without children, Gertrude Stein.. loads of people write extraordinary things without children. Every life that you live will give material for fiction. But given that I do have children, it is that experience of just the simple thing of seeing life in the round. Its so dull to say that, but it is extraordinary to see your childhood replayed, refracted, to see yourself saying things your parents said, to be in this new relation to death.
Finally, to Zadie's revelation of the greatest lie ever told...about love. Any guesses If you have read On Beauty you would already know in case you haven't, why its simple really. According to Zadie, (and I think you will agree), 'the greatest lie ever told about love is that it sets you free.'

Observer Schoolboy Cricketer remains the most memorable - Arjuna
Sri Lankas World Cup-winning captain turned Cabinet Minister Arjuna Ranatunga feels thar an award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show remains the most memorable to any Schoolboy Cricketer.
Ranatunga, a reliable middle order batsman who had aggregated 5,105 runs including four centuries and 38 fifties and captured 16 wickets in 93 Tests, said winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year or any other major Award at the event is a life-time experience for any cricketer.
You may go places and win many other Awards at higher levels, but an Award won at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event remains the most memorable in any cricketers life, said Ranatunga. Winning the this Award twice remains the most cherished moment in my life he further added that those title had given him tremendous inspiration and confidence when he had stepped into the international arena.
When a schoolboy is adjudged the Best Batsman, Best Bowler, Best Allrounder or the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, thats a tremendous boost for a youngster, who could then aim at club level and international level thereafter, he added.
While being a schoolboy cricketer playing for Ananda, Ranatunga had the honour of representing Sri Lanka at the countrys inaugural Test against England in 1982. He made it a memorable occasion by becoming the first Sri Lankan to score a half century (54) in Test cricket. He has proved his class in limited over cricket too, aggregating 7,456 runs in 269 ODIs, including four centuries and 49 fifties.
Ranatunga has come a long way since his early days as a junior schoolboy cricketer to go places to end his sporting career as a legend in world cricket. He now holds an important Cabinet portfolio as a politician, serving as Minister of Petroleum Resources Development.
Despite achieving loads of success as a cricketer, including his dynamic leadership to pilot Sri Lanka team to win the 1996 World Cup, Ranatunga still admires the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer trophies he had won in 1980 and 1982 as a school cricket star from Ananda College.
Talking about Sri Lankas success in the global cricket tournaments, our memories go back to Sri Lankas first ever success at a World Cup tournament. It was way back in 1996 that Sri Lanka had its most cherished moment in international cricket, winning the ICC World Cup tournament in Lahore Pakistan on March 17.
Besides Ranatunga, there had been several other past Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title winners in that champion outfit which opened a new chapter in Sri Lanka sport by conquering the Mount Everest in world cricket. They are Asanka Gurusinha (1985), Roshan Mahanama (1983 and 1984), Muttiah Muralitharan (1991), Kumara Dharmasena (1989) and Marvan Atapattu (1990). Former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) Sanath Jayasuriya too had been a member of that champion outfit, ending as the player of the tournament for his memorable success with the bat and ball.
Jayasuriya, the former Sri Lanka captain and ex-Chairman of Selectors, was adjudged the Most Valuable Player of the 1996 World Cup tournament too had been a recipient of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year outstation title in 1988. Those credentials are ample testimony to prove that the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest has always produced future champions to enter the international arena.
Ranatunga became the first schoolboy to win the prestigious award on two occasions  in 1980 and 1982, as one of the most successful players ever produced by Ananda College. On several occasions, he has cautioned on the poor standard of school cricket, urging the countrys cricket authorities to take meaningful steps to face the challenge. Ranatunga feels the standard of local school cricket has dropped drastically, making a negative impact on the national pool.
It is sad to see the deteriorating standards of school cricket. Unfortunately, officials do not pay much attention to school cricket, Ranatunga was quoted as saying in a recent interview.
Ranatunga, who has made an impeccable contribution to Sri Lanka cricket, said the cricket authorities have forgotten the fact that the foundation to national pool is school cricket. They must keep in mind that school cricket is the cradle to the national team. The Government must also focus on sports and particularly on cricket which has brought glory to our country internationally, he said.
The former Ananda, SSC and Sri Lanka captain feels that lack of spectator interest in school cricket at present is due to poor standard dished out at school level. The quality of cricket that is produced is poor and discourages spectators. Spectators will always be there if quality cricket is played, maintaining high standards. School cricket could regain the spectators it has lost if we could improve its standard, he added.
During my school cricket days, future Sri Lankan stars could be identified from junior cricket level. Then when we played first XI cricket, more than half of the top 20 schoolboy cricketers were assured of their places in the national pool. But it is altogether a different scenario now due to poor standards. Even if a player has performed well at school level now, he will find it hard and is unable to absorb the pressure at club or national level.
That is why we dont see schoolboy cricketers stepping straight into the national team and cement their place as experienced during our era, Ranatunga said.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest is sponsored by Sri Lankas national mobile service provider - SLT Mobitel, which has taken the four-decade-old contest towards new horizons. Sunday Observers great partnership with SLT Mobitel has gone from strength to strength due to the untiring efforts of its CEO Nalin Perera.
The entry of Mobitel 11 years ago to provide financial support to the oldest Cricket Awards show in Sri Lanka has undoubtedly lifted the standard of the contest after its humble beginnings way back in 1978/79. Since then, it has come a long way to set new standards and inspiring other media organizations to have similar contests. Not only the winners of the main Award - the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year but also the winners of many other awards such as the Best Batsman, Best Bowler and the best all-rounder, have made their mark in the international arena.
Sri Lankas flagship English newspaper - the Sunday Observer, understood the need to recognize the raw talent of the countrys schoolboy cricketers at a time when there had been no organized inter-school cricket tournaments, apart from the traditional first XI matches of the so-called leading schools.
But the introduction of the show and its expansion to have a separate segment for the outstation schoolboy cricketers went a long way in inspiring the talented cricketers in the far flung areas.
Voting coupons for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, conducted under three categories, are being published in the Lake House national newspapers  Sunday Observer, Daily News, Dinamina and Thinakaran.
