No Messi, problem as Argentina down Chile
Santa Clara, Tuesday: Argentina shrugged off the injury absence of Lionel Messi to launch their Copa America Centenario campaign with a 2-1 defeat of defending champions Chile here Monday.
Goals from Angel Di Maria and Ever Banega secured a deserved three points for Argentina, who exacted sweet revenge for their defeat to the Chileans in last years Copa America final.
Chile substitute Jose Fuenzalida scored an injury time consolation for the holders.
The Argentines will now be firm favorites to progress to the quarter-finals as Group D winners with games against Panama and Bolivia to come.
Injured Argentina captain Messi watched from the substitutes bench at Levis Stadium after failing to recover in time from a sore back suffered in a friendly win over Honduras last month.
But the Barcelona superstars absence was barely noticeable, with Nicolas Gaitan slotting into Argentinas attack and making an instant impression, hitting the woodwork with a header after only two minutes.
That missed chance set the tone for the early exchanges of an entertaining first half which saw Argentina create the lions share of opportunities without managing to find a breakthrough goal.
Manchester United defender Marcos Rojo was the next to test Chile goalkeeper Claudio Bravo, unleashing a dipping shot from 20 yards which the Barcelona stopper comfortably saved in the 17th minute.
In midfield meanwhile a fascinating battle for supremacy was unfolding between Argentinas rugged enforcer Javier Mascherano and Chiles combative Bayern Munich star Arturo Vidal.
Vidal did not wait long to make his mark on the contest, crashing into the back of Gaitan with an ugly challenge to earn a yellow card from Uruguayan referee Daniel Fedorczuk.Chile, fielding the core of their victorious Copa America side, gradually grew into the game.
But it was Argentina who continued to look the more threatening and they might have taken the lead on 22 minutes after a lightning fast counter-attack. AFP

## Title: When Muhammad Ali met Prince

When Muhammad Ali met Prince
June, 1997. Prince, at this time, is one of the best-known artists in the world, his string of 1980s and early 1990s hits still recent enough for people to see him as an artist at his peak.
And yet, when he received a phone call from another well-known figure, he dropped everything at only 48 hours' notice to fly out to meet him.
It's a measure of Prince's affection for Muhammad Ali that he flew from his native Minneapolis to Washington DC to see him.
And it's a measure of Ali's affection for Prince that he welcomed him like an old friend, despite this being their first meeting.
The setting was the five-star Hay-Adams hotel. The reason was to support Ali's World Healing Project that raised money to combat bigotry worldwide.
'An incredibly long shot'
The man who introduced them to each other, David Clark, spoke to the BBC on Sunday, two days after Ali died aged 74, and six weeks since Prince died suddenly at 57.
Mr Clark worked with Ali on promoting the World Healing Project in 1997.
Knowing an MTV crew would be attending the launch of the scheme, he suggested they seek Prince's support to get more publicity, and contacted his manager Londell McMillan. Not that Prince was known as Prince at this time, of course.
In 1993, he changed his name to a symbol, then to The Artist Formerly Known As Prince, after a dispute with his Warner Bros record label, who refused to release Prince's music when he wanted.
The Artist took to performing with the word "Slave" written on his cheek in protest at his label, which owned the name "Prince" - the name with which he was born. "I had heard that The Artist was a Muhammad Ali fan and had never met him," said Mr Clark, who now runs David Clark Cause, an organisation promoting charitable work around the world.
"We'd known it was an incredibly, incredibly long shot to get someone like him to say "Yes" and travel on his own dime at such short notice.
There was no question of Prince, or The Artist, or the symbol, saying "No".
He had grown up idolising Ali, who had himself changed his name after converting to Islam and denouncing his previous name, Cassius Clay, as his "slave name". "I didn't choose it and I don't want it," he said. "My friend called me a couple of days ago and asked me," Prince told a press conference after arriving in Washington.
"He said, Muhammad wants you to - and I said 'Yes'. I didn't even let him finish. He could have said, 'Mow the lawn,' and I would have been down with it. Muhammad's my hero. He has been since I was a child."
'You have to call him The Artist'
A few hours earlier, Prince had arrived in Washington, and made his way to meet his idol in his hotel room. "There was a knock on the door, and there was The Artist with his security guard," Mr Clark said. "He had a look of amazement on his face.
"He saw Muhammad at the same time Muhammad saw him, and Muhammad said 'Prince!'
"But his daughter, Hana, said 'His name is The Artist, and you have to call him The Artist - or I will get him to call you Cassius Clay.' Then Prince almost jumped into his arms." The two spent the whole day together, with photographs showing them being almost playful with one another - in one image, Ali is seen playing with Prince's hair and ear as the singer grins.
"When Prince came in, they bonded over magic," Mr Clark said.
"Muhammad told Prince he wanted to show him a special trick - Muhammad then got up and pretended to levitate. Prince said 'That's nothing' and jumped up on the table and pretended to be doing the same trick. "They were like two kids. These were two men who were trailblazers. The 'authenticness' of each impressed the other."
Mr Clark said the two men, in their own way, stood apart in their fields. But both, by standing up for what they believed, also paid a price professionally. Ali, in 1967, refused to be drafted to fight in Vietnam, subsequently having his world heavyweight title stripped from him and being banned from competing for three years.
While Prince's decision to stand up to his record label for seven years and to work anonymously did not have such profound implications, Mr Clark said both men were able to admire each other's integrity and determination.
Prince's upbringing - an African-American boy in suburban Minnesota - also led him to look up to Ali, the son of a sign painter in segregation-era Kentucky, Mr Clark said.
"Muhammad seemed to know Prince's music, and from what I understood, when Prince was getting hassled as a young man in Minneapolis, he used to point to the baddest man on the planet being black - Muhammad Ali. "It's my hope that they will not only inspire but ennoble and point the way for other people to follow their own path," Mr Clark said.
"It can be rough sometimes, but in the end, it pays off. And a kid can look up to them and know it's OK to be different."

Will Smith and Lennox Lewis to be Muhammad Ali pallbearers
Louisville, Tuesday: Actor Will Smith and former boxing world champion Lennox Lewis will serve as pallbearers together with six other people during Muhammad Ali's funeral Friday, a spokesman said.
The charismatic Ali, a dazzling fighter and outspoken civil rights activist who became one of the 20th century's towering figures, died Friday at age 74 after health problems complicated by a long battle with Parkinson's disease.
Smith, who played the title role in Michael Mann's film "Ali" (2001), became close to the boxing legend after the filming.
Lewis, who was born in Britain, is considered one of the greatest boxers of the last 25 years, having won several world titles in the 1990s and 2000s.
The two celebrities will carry Ali's coffin together with six family members and close family friends, family spokesman Bob Gunnell said.
The funeral ceremony is set to take place on Friday in Ali's hometown of Louisville, Kentucky in front of a huge crowd. It will be broadcast around the world.
The funeral will follow a procession through the streets and will be preceded on Thursday by a family funeral and an Islamic prayer service held in the 18,000-seat Freedom Hall.
The Louisville funeral is aimed at sending a universal message of peace and tolerance, according to organizers.
Ali died in Phoenix, Arizona, where he had recently lived. His body was returned to Louisville by private plane on Sunday.
He will be buried at Louisville's Cave Hill Cemetery. AFP

UNP MP challenges JO: get MR to vote against Ravi
Puttalam district Parliamentarian Ashoka Priyantha yesterday challenged the Joint Opposition to bring former President, Kurunegala district Parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa to Parliament to vote for the no confidence motion against Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He was addressing the media at the Government Information Department yesterday.
After 10 to 15 years, we now have a separate Finance Minister in Parliament. Because of this, the Joint Opposition was able to bring a No Confidence Motion against the minister. During the previous regime, the Finance Ministry was under the President, Priyantha said. Badulla district MP Chaminda Wijesiri said the Joint Opposition
was trying to mislead their supporters by doing useless things without even one fourth of representation in Parliament.
Kalutara District MP Lakshman Wijemanne said for the first time in history, a defeated President was attempting to destroy the government to get back his lost privileges. bHe said the Rajapaksa regime was the worst regime that Sri Lanka ever had. By bringing a No Confidence Motion against the Finance Minister, the Joint Opposition is helping us to strengthen the peoples confidence in our government, Wijemanne added.

School curriculum to undergo massive overhaul
The school curriculum will undergo a massive overhaul to suit modern requirements, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
He said a new school curriculum would be introduced to offer a job oriented and knowledge-based education system. He said a committee headed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe sits twice a week to discuss revisions to the education sector. He said changes to the education system have been proposed in a futuristic manner.
He said unemployment among youth will be solved under the new system.
We provide internationally recognised training to Principals. We are in the process of training 4,000 principals. There were 6,768 vacancies in the cadre of principals. We held an examination to fill them. We received 21,000 applications and 19,000 sat for the examination. Four thousand passed the exam. There was no political interference in this regard, he said.
The minister said the number of students in a class has been limited to 40, adding that this would be brought down to 35 by 2020.
Replying to a charge by MP Bandula Gunawardena that the number of admissions for commerce courses at the National Colleges of Education have been reduced, the minister said the step was taken as there were limited vacancies for the subject. He said the new criteria adopted to recruit students for the National Colleges of Education helped to recruit 1,250 students more.
Whenever we propose a change to an system, criticisms flow. This was the same for the voucher system introduced in replace of school uniform material. However, many said the new system is good. Likewise, the new set of criteria for the enrolment of the National Colleges of Education will also be praised later, he said.
Attempt to get politicalcapital through grapevine - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told in Parliament that there is an attempt to get political advantages by spreading rumours about the fire broke out at the Salawa Army Camp.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardane under Standing Order 23(2). The Prime Minister said certain groups attempt to get political advantages by arousing racialism.
He said the public representatives of all parties are engaged in the relief assistance process by forgetting their different political views.
Tax burden will go down by year end
Taxes will not be increased further this year. The tax burden will be reduced by the year end, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake told in Parliament yesterday.
He was responding to a question raised by UPFA Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila.
He said the expected income of Rs. 1,886 billion in 2016 is relatively realistic in comparison to the income of 2015 due to measures taken to strengthen the government revenue by simplify the tax system, broadening the tax base, introducing new tax proposals, increasing the efficiency in tax administration by introducing new technology for main revenue collecting authorities and strengthening public enterprises.
The expected income from tax revenue in 2015 was Rs. 1,293 billion. The expected income of non-tax revenue in 2015 was Rs.162 billion. The actual income from tax revenue (provisional) in 2015 was Rs. 1,282 billion and the actual income from non tax revenue in 2015 was Rs.125 billion.
The actual tax income as a percentage of the expected tax income is 99.2 percent and the actual non tax income as a percentage of the expected non tax income is 77.1 percent.

Responding to a question raised by Parliamentarian Kanaka Heart, Minister Karunatilake said it is expected to regulate childrens programmes under the mechanism since childrens programmes on certain television channels are lack of quality.
He said the ministry has a plan to introduce a new childrens programme which will help the growth of childrens mind.
The ministry will get the assistance of the Child Affairs Ministry for the implementation of the regulatory mechanism, he said.

Around 47,502 dengue patients reported in 2014 and 97 deaths were reported in the same year.
He said around 1,563 dengue cases were reported within first four months of 2016.
SAITM standards far better than those of State Medical Faculties - SB
Facilities and standards of the academic staff of the SAITM are far better than those of the Medical Faculties of Colombo, Peradeniya and Ragama Universities, Social Empowerment and Welfare Minister S. B. Dissanayake told in Parliament yesterday.
He was participating in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
Former Higher Education Minister Dissanayake who granted the degree awarding status to the SAITM, challenged to compare the facilities
and staff of the private medical institution with those of other medical faculties in the country.
He said the Higher Education Minister has the power to veto the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) decision.
These students have gone to court. We hope they will mete out justice. Students with 3S at the Advanced Level Examination from areas such as Kilinochchi and Manner had been admitted to state medical faculties. The SAITM does not have such students. It has students in urban and semi urban areas who could not afford to spend about Rs. 30-40million for a medical degree, he said.
He said the SLMC did not hesitate to recognise the medical degree of the Kothalawala Defence University and was even ready to amend the Act to recognise it, the minister said.
Cabinet paper to make Tamil proficiency prerequisite for public sector recruitment
The National Dialogue Ministry has formulated a Cabinet paper to make Tamil language proficiency a prerequisite for recruitment to the public service, Minister Mano Ganesan told in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation in reply to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda under the Standing Order 23 (2). He said the Cabinet paper
has been taken up at a Cabinet Sub-Committee.
He said even though Tamil language proficiency has been made compulsory for all public servants by a Circular, it has not been properly
observed.
The National Language Policy has not been implemented properly over the past years. It was a dead document when I assumed duties, but I have taken measures to put it into practice. We have paid attention to make Sinhala and Tamil language proficiency compulsory at least in areas where both the languages are widely used, he said.
He said measures have been taken to recruit 500 Tamil speaking individuals to the Police service, adding that they would be given appointments in the North and the East. Commenting on language issues in Court, the minister said if the judge could not understand Tamil, a system in which the defendant could ask to take up his case before a panel of judges who can understand Tamil would be introduced in the future.
Higher Education Minister to comply with SC verdict
Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday in Parliament said that he was waiting for the Supreme Court verdict on the matter of recognition for the SAITM medical degree adding that he would oblige by the decision.
He was taking part in an adjournment motion moved by JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake on the problems of the education sector.
We hope the Supreme Court will sympathetically look at SAITM students issues and come up with a solution that will protect the standards of the medical degrees. We have to look into the fate of these students. The court will take a fair decision, he said.
The minister said the Medical Faculties of the State Universities had admitted students with 3S from rural areas.
At the same time those who had obtained 2As and 1B in areas such as Galle and Kandy had been unable to enter into the university. SAITM students have gone to court. We hope they will meet out justice by the court, he said.
The minister said those in the Joint Opposition must be responsible for the issues of the SAITM students. However, he said the same group is against recognising this medical degree.
UPFA MP Ramesh Pathirana proposed to introduce the Act 16 exam for those who pass out from private medical institutions.

Progressive SLFP ministers, MPs should support
If SLFP ministers and MPs with progressive ideas oppose the heaping of unnecessary burden on the people they should come forward to support the no-confidence motion moved against the Finance Minister, Parliamentarian Bandula Gunawardena said.
Addressing a press conference organised by the Economic Research Unit of the Joint opposition at the Sri Vajirashrama Buddhist Centre, Punchi Borella, Gunawardena said the rupee which remained stable during the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime had become unstable today and the responsibility for this outcome should be borne by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
He said the government had resorted to the printing of money to the tune of Rs. 281 billion in 2015 and this was the result of poor financial management. They in the Joint Opposition were moving the no-confidence against the Finance Minister for heaping unbearable burden on the people.
Prof. G. L. Peiris said people have been heaped with heavy burden due to the mismanagement of the economy by the Finance Minister.
The 17 percent increase on VAT had adversely affected prices of cement, sand and vehicles and badly affected industrialists and the export sector.
He alleged that certain SLFP Parliamentarians were resorting to duplicity by criticising this government and later raising their hands in Parliament in support of the government and its disruptive policies. The vote in parliament today would clearly show whether SLFP Parliamentarians were supportive or opposed to the disruptive policies of the government, he said.
