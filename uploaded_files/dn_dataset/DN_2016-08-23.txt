Statham  to the  rescue

The 2011 film, 'The Mechanic,' which features action star Jason Statham, has a sequel, and it seems that rescuing the lead character's love interest, Jessica Alba, is going to be the focus of the movie.
Statham reportedly declined the offer of reviving the 2015 'Transporter' movie by Camille Delamarre, which is why fans did see Ed Skrein in the 2015 'Transporter: Refueled' film. However, he will be continuing to work on 'The Mechanic's' sequel instead.
According to Spinoff Online, the latest 'Mechanic' movie was filmed at Thailand, specifically in the roads of Bangkok. It has been confirmed by various reports that Statham will reprise his role as Arthur Bishop in the upcoming 'Mechanic: Resurrection' movie, which stars the actor and his new leading lady, played by the 'Fantastic Four' star.
If fans can still remember, Bishop, as one of the toughest assassins in the first 'Mechanic' movie, was targeted by the person he trained, Steve Mckenna, played by Ben Foster.
However, Bishop outsmarted Mckenna, and in the last scene of the movie, it showed that Mckenna was in Bishop's car when that car exploded and turned to ashes.
In regards to the plot of 'Mechanic: Resurrection,' it has been reported that the storyline will involve to Bishop leaving the life of an assassin, but someone from his past convinced him to go back to his previous line of work.
Reports also claim that Alba's character will be kidnapped in the movie, and this will somehow put more action and drama to the film later on.
The 'Mechanic' is a remake based on the 1972 film with the same name. It is said that the 2011 film earned $62 million dollars from an estimated budget of $40 million dollars, which is why it is not surprising that it is going to have a sequel. Aside from "'Mechanic' films, fans would also like to see Statham again in the next installment of the 'Transporter' series. YIBADA
