Cruel betrayal: Crickets heart broken in Australia
SYDNEY: Being Australias cricket captain is widely seen as the second most important job in the country behind prime minister. Many would argue it holds even more prestige.
This high esteem, and Australians deep love of the game helps explain the stunned disbelief that has greeted skippers Steve Smiths admission that he cheated, and even worse, that it was planned.
In an astonishing development, the captain said he hatched a plot to tamper with the ball in the third Test against South Africa, which saw team-mate Cameron Bancroft use yellow sticky tape on Saturday in Cape Town to try and alter its condition.
He was caught on camera and comically tried to hide the evidence by stuffing it down the front of his trousers.
Everyone from former Test greats, to the Australian Sports Commission, and the public condemned what happened, with the story dominating front pages, television news and coffee shop chatter.
Even Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said he was shocked and bitterly disappointed.
It seemed completely beyond belief that the Australian cricket team had been involved in cheating, he said.
Cricket, long considered the gentlemans game, is more than a sport in Australia -- it is widely seen as helping shape the country itself, with its British origins helping foster and develop the national character, morals and ideals.
Wearing the baggy green cap of the national team is sacred, an honour earned by barely 450 people.
With that accolade comes great responsibilities in a former colony whose national identity owes much to its prowess in sport.
To cheat is just not in the spirit of what Australians do. They fight hard, they play hard, but they dont cheat, cricket fan Steve Chaka told AFP in Sydney.
Another, Giovanni Cettolin, said Smiths lapse of judgement was definitely not good sportsmanship for an Australian.
Us Aussies all dig in and fight hard, you know, and obviously he didnt do that. Its a shame, it really is.
- Cricket helps define us
As Jaimie Fuller, executive chairman of the Skins compression wear group of companies, explained in a full-page newspaper advert Monday: Cricket is such a part of our national psyche that it helps define us.
It helps give us a sense of what is fair, and what is not; what is right and what is wrong. He said Cricket Australia had a moral responsibility to display good governance in how it responds to the scandal.
If you dont, its not just the Australian cricket team who is shamed, but it will be all of you. It will be cricket. And it will be all of us. Catherine McGregor, author of the book An Indian Summer of Cricket, said it would take a long time for the Australian public to forgive this cruel betrayal.
No other game is so self-conscious in revering noble defeat, nor in insisting how it is played is more important than the result, she wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
Cheating in order to win at any price just isnt cricket. She added that the anger of cricket lovers around the country was understandable.
They are the true believers. This team is unworthy of them. Australian cricket fans have long regarded the national teams style as hard but fair, but there has been mounting concern about the perceived arrogance from some, with the cheating scandal a step too far.
Peter Lalor, cricket correspondent for The Australian and Sydneys Daily Telegraph, said the conspiracy clearly showed there is something rotten at the heart of the Australian cricket team.
The public has struggled to love a side that wins ugly, but success and nationalism and tradition have patched the frayed fabric, he wrote Monday. A conspiracy to cheat, however, has ripped the cloth and major repairs will be needed. AFP

Over 55,000 projects in three years sans propaganda
Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said the government, over the past three years, has launched over 55,000 development projects in various parts of the country and spent over Rs. 1 million on each project.
"It's tragic that we have failed to communicate this effectively to the public. Development communication must be at the heart of government propaganda," he said yesterday, addressing a meeting on developing infrastructure in rural areas.
"There is a dire need of a comprehensive campaign on what we have done for the public. The people at grassroots level are unaware of the crucial decisions made at the top level. These issues need to be corrected. One would say it's too late now, but we must understand the importance of these corrective measures," he added.
"Development alone is not enough to stay on top of our game. Due value should be given to communication as well," the minister said, adding that immediate measures have to be adopted to fill this 'communication-gap'.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Prime Minister's Secretary Saman Ekanayake, Secretary to the Media and Finance Ministry Dr. R. H.S. Samaratunga, Secretary to the Project Management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Ministry Gamini Seneviratne and Additional Secretary to the Prime Minister Saman Athaudahetti were also present.

Addressing a press conference at the JHU Head Office in Battaramulla, the Minister implied that certain Parliamentarians were involved in spreading communal hatred.
Some pointed finger at the JHU. Police have conducted a comprehensive investigation, and I urge Police to reveal the politicians behind the violent acts in Teldeniya. Reveal how an SLPP party member attended the funeral of Kumarasinghe and incited racial hatred. The majority of persons arrested by Police were pro-Rajapaksas. Police investigations have revealed that no JHU member was connected to this incident, he said.
The Minister said that if Police do not reveal the names of politicians involved in the recent incident in Kandy, the JHU will expose them in time to come.

We go against government if Glyphosate ban lifted
Jathika Hela Urumaya Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said they would stand against the government if the ban on the glyphosate was lifted.
The Thera said the government imposed the ban on glyphosate and several other chemicals three years ago. He said the government was influenced by many persons including ministers to lift the ban stating that the tea plantation was affected due to the ban.
Rathana Thera said this was baseless. Those who influence the government do so because they are misled by the officials and the agents of multinational companies.
The Thera made this observation yesterday during a press conference held at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA) in Colombo.
The allegation that the tea production was reduced by 10 percent in 2016 due to the non-use of glyphosate in the previous year was baseless. It happened due to the drought in 2015 and it is proved by the fact that the tea production increased by five percent in 2017, the Thera said. The Thera said the allegations was made by tea planters that contribute 25 percent of the tea production and not by Small Tea Holders who produce 75 percent.
A professor says glyphosate is edible, Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said. I challenge him to consume a spoon of gyphosate before the public, the Thera challenged.

The Attorney General (AG) yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that the AG is objecting to extend the Interim Order preventing the Police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act, regarding a Magistrates Court inquiry since it had been issued on the basis of an exparte proceeding.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appearing on behalf of the AG made this submissions when a writ petition filed by the former Defence Secretary was taken up for support.
Meanwhile, Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne yesterday further extended until tomorrow (28) its Interim Order preventing the Police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D.A.

Both parties are to make their further oral submissions today as well.
The Court had upheld Rajapaksas version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of his legitimate expectations.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.

Justin Bieber's "new woman" has been identified as 22-year-old model Baskin Champion. The Sorry singer, who split from on-off girlfriend Selena Gomez earlier this month, was spotted cuddling up to a stunning blonde as they watched British singer Craig David perform at The Roxy in West Hollywood on March 20. Footage obtained by Entertainment Tonight showed the 24-year-old with his arm around her waist, while eyewitnesses told the site the pair spent most of the night together and even danced closely at one point.
Video by TMZ.com showed Justin and his partner leaving the venue together at the end of the night and getting into the same car.
Now it has been revealed that Justin's mystery blonde is in fact model Baskin.
According to Entertainment Tonight, Justin and Baskin met through his close friend Patrick Schwarzenegger, who is dating the model's younger sister Abby Champion.
Baskin is something of a star on social media, frequently posted images of herself in revealing ensembles, and often shares shots of herself in the gym or working out.
Religion is also a big part of her life, as she told Alabama.com in a 2016 interview: "If young girls could see anything about me, I would want it to be that living for Christ is the greatest joy that I, or anyone, could ever have. I deal with people who have lots of money and success but who are not happy on the inside. Having a relationship with God is most fulfilling."
Justin has also spoken about the importance of his faith, and is frequently pictured attending church services wherever he is in the world.
However, a source told ET that Justin's romantic display on Tuesday night was an attempt to make Selena, who is currently on vacation in Australia, jealous.
"Selena is off having fun with her friends and so hes showing that he can still go out and have fun too. And to be honest, Im sure theres a part of him that wants to make Selena a bit jealous!" the source explained. Music News

A census to determine the deer population in the Trincomalee Fort area was conducted by officials of the Wildlife Department along with the Army, Police, Civil Defence Force, GAs office and the Trincomalee Divisional Secretariat office.
The purpose of this census is to get accurate information on the growth rates of the deer population around this area to determine if there is growth or a decline. This census will give us an exact number of every type of deer, including males, females, pregnant animals, and fawns, said research conductor W. A. Lalithkumara.
The census report will be published within two weeks. Another census had to be carried out before the launch to confirm the accuracy, he said.
Free-roaming deer are hard to find, which makes this area a popular tourist attraction, said GA N.A.A. Pushpakumara who participated in this census.
We found 520 deer when conducting this census. But we cannot give 100 percent accuracy to this number without conducting another census. After doing so, we plan to take long-term measures to conserve this deer population, said Anura Bandara, Chairman of the Gonatata Environment Organization.

Checkmate or knockout: Chess boxing lands a punch
With his dental guard still in his mouth and a slightly queasy feeling in his gut, a shirtless Thomas Cazeneuve was exuberant after checkmating his opponent during a chess boxing bout in Berlin, the world capital of the unusual sport.
Just as deft in the movement of his rooks as with his fists, Cazeneuve claimed victory against his Ukrainian challenger after seven alternating rounds of boxing and chess.
The match played out before a crowd of curious onlookers drawn to the spectacle of the so-called "Intellectual Fight Club".
Chess boxing was born 16 years ago when its founder Iepe Rubingh brought to life a seemingly far-fetched idea from a French graphic novel, "Cold Equator" by Enki Bilal.
Today, Rubingh has set his sights on introducing chess boxing to the Olympics and even looking at sending robots into battle, as the multidisciplinary sport gains popularity.
The rules of chess boxing are simple.
Three minutes of gentlemanly chess played on a board in the ring is alternated with three-minute bouts of intense boxing over 11 rounds -- six of chess, five of boxing.
The winner has to earn either a boxing knockout or a checkmate on the chessboard, but either chess boxer can be disqualified for taking too long to make a chess move or by breaking the boxing rules. AFP

Cilic, del Potro reach Miami Open fourth round
Miami, Monday: Former US Open champions Marin Cilic and Juan Martin del Potro powered into the fourth round of the Miami Open on Sunday with straight-sets victories.
Argentina's fifth-seeded del Potro, chasing his second ATP Masters title in as many weeks, breezed past Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-2, 6-2.
Ranked sixth in the world after vanquishing Swiss great Roger Federer in the final at Indian Wells last weekend, del Potro needed just 73 minutes to book a fourth-round meeting with Filip Krajinovic of Serbia, who beat France's Benoit Paire 6-3, 6-3.
Second-seeded Cilic also reached the fourth round with a 7-5, 7-6 (7/4) victory over Canadian Vasek Pospisil.
Cilic produced six aces and saved all three break points he faced. But Pospisil made him work to finish it off, save three match points on his own serve in the 12th game of the second set.
"It was a relief at the end," Cilic admitted. "I had those three match points at 6-5 and there was that great rally at deuce. I was playing really well in the tie-break, returning really well and serving really good. I saved the best for last and I'm really pleased with the victory."
Cilic will face 14th-seeded American John Isner for a quarter-final berth. Isner defeated Russian veteran Mikhail Youzhny 6-4, 6-3.
Cilic and del Potro are the biggest names left in a field lacking star power thanks to the early exits of Federer and Novak Djokovic and the injury absences of Rafael Nadal and Andy Murray.
Third-seeded Grigor Dimitrov of Bulgaria joined the exodus as he fell 6-4, 6-4 to unseeded Frenchman Jeremy Chardy.
Del Potro, the hottest player on the ATP tour right now, is actually in search of a third straight ATP crown after back-to-back victories in Acapulco and Indian Wells.
His win in the California desert was his first in a Masters 1000 event, a welcome milestone after a succession of injury setbacks almost forced him into retirement in 2015. "I think I'm playing good," Del Potro said after his 13th straight match win. "I can play even better, but I need to get confidence playing in this court, trying to keep winning matches.
"But it's not easy," he added. "My body starts to feel tight because of all my success."
In other third-round action, South Korean Chung Hyeon posted a convincing 6-1, 6-1 victory over American qualifier Michael Mmoh.
Chung, who has yet to drop a set in Miami, needed just 63 minutes to advance to a meeting with Portugal's Joao Sousa, who rallied for a 1-6, 6-3, 6-4 win over American Jared Donaldson. AFP

Colombo Port 13th best connectivity port in the world
The Port of Colombo that had been ranked as the 18th Best Connectivity Port by the Drewry Port Connectivity Index is up by five places and is now ranked the 13th best Connectivity Port in the world in the 4th quarter 2017.
According to the rankings the Port of Colombo is also the top best connectivity port in South Asia. The Drewry Global Container Port Connectivity Index recently announced the top 20 ports with new entries of Jebel Ali and Algeciras to the listing for the 4th quarter of 2017.
The shipping consultancy Drewry that has launched a regular, bespoke index of port connectivity in this latest edition of its Ports & Terminals Insight report aims to show how well connected the worlds container Ports are.
The index divides the world into seven major zones, and measures each ports breadth of connectivity by the number of regions served and how many mainline services call per week. Routes that involve transshipment are not counted, nor are intra-regional services within a region.
The Drewry Global Container Port Connectivity Index that signifies the importance of port connectivity as important as size or scale, consists of two variables, the number of mainline services calling at each port per week and the regions in the world to which each port is directly linked. Having the widest possible range of direct service is a significant competitive advantage for all ports, it says.
At a recent meeting with all terminal operators and stakeholders of the Port of Colombo, held at the Ministry of Ports and Shipping, Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that the port exceeded the 6.1 million TEU target in collaboration with all terminals at the Port of Colombo and the port expects to reach the 7 million TEU target by the end this year.
We will take the new initiative forward to promote the Port of Colombo internationally, together with all stake holders and to attract more new shipping lines that work in alliances to the port," he said.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) recently signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) with the terminals of the Port of Colombo to operate collectively to promote the Port of Colombo.
On the Asia to Europe sector there are 17 loops of which only 03 are calling Colombo. Therefore, obviously, we have got challenges to ensure that collectively we should attract more loops into the Port of Colombo. This means, we have to go beyond the partisan approach of promoting our terminals to protect the Port of Colombo, the Chairman said.
The top management officials of the three terminals of the Port of Colombo that includes the state owned Jaya Container Terminal (JCT), and the two terminals that run under Public Private Partnership (PPP) the South Asia Gateway Terminal (SAGT) and the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) also attended the meeting.

Cricket the noble art by Sunil Wettimuny
Perhaps the three of the greatest players ever to play at one time in Sri Lanka were S.S. Jayawickrema, F.C. de Saram and M Sathasivam. They would have been prominent in any company, in any age, against any opposition. They were batsmen of the classic mould, orthodox for the main part of their makeup but so possessed of genius that each would on occasion do the unusual. A visible mark of their popularity and entertainment value was the huge crowds that used to throng the grounds at Victoria Park, Maitland Crescent or any other venue when these three were on show. stated Sunil Wettimuny in his book Cricket The Noble Art. Sunil was also my team mate at Ananda in 1966.
A great pity that the above mentioned trio, were born too soon to participate in Test cricket, but that cannot detract from the class they achieved and exhibited. Test cricket was poorer for that fact recalled Sunil who in fact was not far behind these greats in class and elegance when it came to batting.
Sargo Jayawickrema was said to be a shrewd captain, he led his team by example as well as precept. They said no bowler could contain him, his footwork and judgement being of the highest class. Chats with him revealed his modesty and retiring disposition. He was also generous in praise of the youngsters and he had high hopes for their future and that of Sri Lanka, reminisced Sunil.
Jayawickremas modesty and unselfishness can, perhaps be illuminated by one single act: he once declared his innings closed when his own score stood at 199! Once he scored 133 for Ceylon versus India after being felled, hit on the head, by a thunder bolt from Mohammed Nizar, in the first over, at Brabourne Stadium, Bombay. It showed the mans courage and determination, noted Sunil.
They said Sathasivam was all grace and elegance. He improvised like the true artist. He favoured the late cut and was well known for it. His double century (215) for the Ceylon Cricket Association against South India in 1947 at Chepauk Stadium is still a talking point. Some of Indias more prominent bowlers were in action. He treated them with scorn, born of pre-knowledge of what he would do!
It is a sad fact that he did not pay due attention to his physical fitness. Many were the stories told of his escapades, late nights and heavy drinking on the eve of a match. He would often follow up such revels with a century, dazzling in its brilliance. Not an example to emulate!  Satha to his friends, also captained Ceylon in 1948, lived the part of a gay cavalier on the cricket field.
Then there was F.C. de Saram who was awarded his blue at Oxford and also represented the University at Tennis and Golf. This old Ceylon captain was a man dedicated to the task of improving cricket in the country. He had a forthright character, was no respecter of persons, and called a spade a spade. His sincerity about the game was unquestionable.
At Oxford in 1934, he was the first player in England to score a century against the devastating leg spinner then, C.V. Grimmett. English papers rightfully headlined de Saram shows how to face Grimmett.
Sunil mentioned that he was able to benefit considerably from having known him and talked cricket with him. His constructive criticism at the nets was a tremendous education to him. He was unconventional in language, which reminded him of an occasion when he got out close to the wicket- bat and pad on a wet track. He came upto him and said you should have known better how to hold a dead bat like my dead..!
This grand old man was a great captain of Sri Lanka who planned his moves as a General did his battles. Inside that rough exterior was a man of sound common sense steeped in cricket knowledge. Ceylons great ambassador in the 1920s was Dr C.H. Gunasekera who played for Cambridge and later for Middlesex with Sir Pelham Warner. Middlesex won the county championship that year - 1921.
He was said to have an amazingly quick assessment of a batsmans weakness. But fielding was his undoubted forte.
He was well known throughout the length and breadth of cricketing England as the India Rubber Man. He was caricatured in the Daily Express, all arms and legs stretched telescopically in all directions, grabbing a ball in flight. Its a matter of regret that he did not meet him often. He could have learnt much from him, concluded Sunil.

From crisis to sustenance  Part 21: Find a common purpose, to help others see themselves in the picture
Last week we began discussing Five Practices of Exemplary Leadership and the corresponding ten commitments of leadership. We analysed the first three in details. Today we continue with commitment numbers 4, 5 and 6.
Commitment no-04
Enlist others in a common vision by appealing to their interests, hopes, and dreams
Leadership is a relationship between those who aspire to lead and those who choose to follow. Leaders must master the dynamics of this relationship. They must learn how to mobilize others to want to struggle for shared aspirations. This means that leaders need to acquire the understanding, skills, and experience to collaborate successfully. Within this context, leaders move away from being the sole decision maker to involving others such as staff, and community members in the decision-making process.
Motivation is what drives individuals to work in the way they do to fulfil goals, needs or expectations. These are numerous, varied and changing.
Leaders can uplift people's spirits with an ennobling perspective about why they should strive to be better than they are today. This means that to create an organised movement as well as significant change, leaders need to enlist others. They also must appeal a shared aspiration because people will not follow until the vision is accepted as their own.
Leaders must speak others language to enlist them in a vision. Leaders not only understand people's needs but also have their interests at heart when they are to sign up for journeys into the future. Leaders breathe life into visions through vivid language and an effective style. Their own enthusiasm and excitement are contagious and spread from the leader to constituents. Their belief in and enthusiasm for the vision are the sparks that ignite the flame of inspiration.
In order to make their visions become true, leaders need to keep people focused and excited about the meaning and significance of their work. Leaders have to animate the vision and make manifest the purpose so that others can see it, hear it and feel it. It is not leader's dream alone but is the people's vision.
In order to accomplish this ideal, the leader needs to: foster collaboration by building trust and facilitating relationships, show trust to build trust, get people interacting to facilitate relationship, strengthen others by increasing self-determination and developing competence, increase individual accountability to enhance self-determination andoffer training support to develop competence.
Commitment no-05
Strengthen people by giving power away, providing choice, developing competence, assigning critical tasks, and offering visible support
Highly effective leaders do not get things done by issuing orders and directives to obedient underlings. Rather, they achieve success by unleashing the energy of the organization by creating an environment that generates a sense of commitment and engagement in their people. And they do this by giving away  not hoarding  the power and authority of their own positions.
Effective leaders recognize that people are motivated to work hard when they feel a sense of personal responsibility for effectively performing activities that they care about. But a sense of personal responsibility is impossible without a significant degree of autonomy. Effective leaders recognize this by empowering their subordinates  giving them plenty of room to exercise judgment and make decisions about how they get their work done.
But while delegation and empowerment are necessary conditions for effective leadership, they don't tell the whole story. Empowerment can actually lead to chaos if it is not accompanied by clarity from the leader regarding:
(1). Where we are going  the vision; 2. How we will get there  the strategy; (3). How we will conduct ourselves  the organization's core values
An effective leader must also ensure that people possess the knowledge and skills necessary to achieve what is expected of them. This in turn requires leaders to carefully select the right people, assign them to roles to which they're suited, and to ensure they have the right training, development and coaching to accomplish what is asked of them.
So, effective leaders realize that their role is to create the context for effective performance by those reporting to them. That means leaders must work hard to remove ambiguity for their subordinates regarding what they are trying to accomplish together (their vision), how they are going to move toward that vision (their strategy), and how they will conduct themselves on their journey together (their values). Leaders must also ensure that each member of their team also clearly understands their specific role and responsibilities. Once these factors are in place, effective leaders release the latent energy of the team by giving up formal power and authority by clearly delegating it to their team members.
Thinking of leadership effectiveness as giving up power and authority also provides insights regarding the downsides of charismatic leadership. While charismatic leaders can often be effective in the short run, they are rarely successful in creating teams and organizations that endure. Charismatic leaders create energy and enthusiasm based on their personal strengths and magnetism, but they often leave little room for others to exercise initiative or take responsibility for results.
Commitment no-06
Set the example by behaving in ways that are consistent with shared values
Exemplary leaders have strong beliefs about matters of principle. People expect their leaders to speak out on matters of values and conscience. Nevertheless, how can you speak out if you dont know whats important to you How can you show you care if you dont know what you care about To earn and sustain personal credibility, you must find your voice by clarifying your personal values and expressing them in your own style. By finding your voice, you take the first step in the journey to becoming a leader. By asking yourself what value you bring to your constituents, you stay at the leading edge.
Leaders are clear about the values and motivations that drive them. Values serve as guides. By identifying your values, you find your voice. The clearer you are about your values, the easier it is for you to stay on the path you have chosen. Values inform your decisions about what to do, when to say yes and when to say no, and why you make those decisions.
Learn to express your values in a way that is genuinely and authentically you. You must authentically communicate your beliefs in ways that uniquely represent who you are. You must interpret the lyrics and shape them into your own presentation so that others recognize that youre the one whos singing.
Set the example
Clarity about personal values is part of modelling the way for others. If you stand for some personal set of values, then the only person youll be leading will be yourself. When you lead a group or organization, you have to move from what I believe to what we believe.
We cant impose values from the top. It either leads to compliance or rebellion. Values cannot be forced. They must be forged. Being clear about personal values allows us to detect where there are shared values in the community.
Discovering values that can be shared is the foundation for building productivity and genuine working relationships. Although leaders honour the diversity of their constituencies, they also stress their common values. Leaders build on agreement. They dont worry about getting everyone to be in accord.
Tremendous energy is generated when individual, group, and institutional values are aligned. Commitment, enthusiasm, and drive are intensified, as people have reasons for caring about their work. When we care about what we are doing, we are more effective and satisfied. We experience less stress. Shared values are the internal compasses that enable us to act independently and interdependentlysimultaneously.
Align personal actions with shared values
The most powerful thing a leader can do to mobilize others is to set the example by aligning personal actions with shared values. Leaders show up, pay attention, and participate directly in getting extraordinary things done. They show others by their own example that they are deeply committed to the values and aspirations they espouse. Leaders are measured by the consistency of their deeds and wordsby walking the talk. Leading by example is how leaders make visions and values tangible. It is how they provide the evidence that they are committed and competent.
Leaders enact the meaning of the organization in every decision they make and in every step they take. Leaders understand that they bring shared values to life in a variety of settingsin staff meetings, one-on-one conferences, telephone calls, e-mails, sermons, and in visits with colleagues and constituents.
Show people whats important by how you spend your time
How you spend your time is the single clearest indicator, especially to other people, about whats important to you. Critical incidents chance occurrences, particularly at a time of stress and challenge, offer significant moments of learning for leaders. They are often the most dramatic sources of moral lessons about what we should value and how we should behave. They become stories that are passed down in the workplace.
Therefore, you might use an organizer or journal to assess your alignment with your principles. Every evening, ask, What have I done today to demonstrates that this value is near and dear to me What have I done inadvertently to demonstrate this is not a value for me What do I need to do to more fully express my values

The Ceylon Workers Congress candidate was elected as the Chairman of the HattonDickoya Urban Council by drawing lots.
The UNP was able to obtain 6 seats during the Local Government elections while the Ceylon Workers Congress secured two seats and the SLPP and the Communist Party acquiring a seat each. Since no party managed to secure a majority at the LG elections, an election by drawing of lots took place with the participation of the Provincial Comisioner Menaka Herath and Sadayan Balachandran from the Ceylon Workers Congress managed to win the election after being tied up with Alagumuttu Nanda Kumara from the UNP.
Tempers frayed during the voting when SLPP candidate Senthil Raj Shiwadarshani voted for the UNP candidate and the police had to be brought in to control the situation.
UNP candidate M.J.M. Farmz picked the winning number from drawing lots with Ceylon Workers Congress candidate Kumara Karunasiri and was elected as the Vice Chairman of the council.

Doctored  discounts..!
With hospitals, doctors and medical companies competing hard for business, its no fault of mine, I dreamt the phone was ringing, Who was it I asked my mother, as she put down the receiver white faced and with saucer eyes like shed seen a ghost.
A telemarketer from the new hospital down the road, she whispered.
You seem upset, what did she want
She said if Id come to the hospital immediately, there was a twenty-five percent discount on liver transplants and they would remove my hernia for free.
Your livers fine, I said, and you dont have a hernia mother.
She sounded positive I had one, cried my mother, I always wondered whether that pain down there.
was not from hernia but your lack of exercise, I said firmly.
She also told me she could halve the rate on a bypass.
What did you tell her I asked, furious.
I told her my heart was fine. But she invited me for a discounted check up next Valentines Day.
Thats a sales gimmick! I exclaimed angrily. Checking hearts on Valentines Day, what else will these hospitals think of next
The doorbell rang, and my mother opened the door to a youngish man, a stethoscope round his neck.
What are you marketing I asked with a grimace.
Health and long life, said the doctor.
I have plenty of that, I said.
Dont tempt fate son, whispered my mother, as she looked fearfully at the doctor.
Do you still run up the stairs like you did ten years back asked the doctor briskly.
He never could ten years ago! sniffed my mother.
Thats because I spent my energy carrying your lazy dog up mother or was it your cats
Animalo Allergica, said the doctor, happily writing onto his pad.
Oh doctor you are so clever, said my mother, looking at the smart fellow with won over eyes. I always wondered why he hated my little Tommy.
I hope it hasnt developed into a tumour, said the doc seriously. We have a fifteen percent rebate for brain surgery, and if we can close the deal right now, we have a tie up with the veterinary hospital and have your dog treated free, or is it a cat
Where am I I asked my mother, as I lay on the stretcher and felt myself being wheeled out of the operation theatre. What am I doing here
You tried to push that charming doctor out of the house, said my mother, but you fell. Luckily there was a ten percent discount on finger amputations that day.
No! I shouted clutching my bandaged finger and screaming at her. Dont worry, said the doctor appearing from nowhere, hes entitled to 50% off from the psychiatric department!
You were yelling in your sleep! said my mother as she walked into my room, do you need to see a doctor
No! I screamed as my mother looked at me puzzled..!

Most Ven. Paligala Naradha Nayake Thera, of the Ekneligoda Sect, and a monk of great recognition by both the Siyam and the Ramanna Chapters, will be presented with the Akthapatra of being appointed Adikarana Sanganayaka of the Sabaragamuwa Province.
The ceremony will be held at the Thoranakada Temple on March 30, at 3.00 pm, chaired by Mahanayake of Amarapura Chapter, Most Ven. Kotugoda Dhammavasa Thera.
At the time he came to live at Pushparamaya Temple, Thoranakada, there were no facilities, no electricity, no easy access to water, and frugal meals and he lived a very hard and difficult life without complaining.
He bore all difficulties with a positive mind and determination to work and bring the temple to its present position.
Narada Thera recalls how he grappled with difficult times and the threat posed to his life during the insurgency and expressed his gratitude to his Guru Kurivita Korale, Chief Adikarana Sanga Nayake Ven. Bulugahapitiye Dhammalankara Nayaka Thera, under whose protection he lived and studied.
He manifested his love and care to people when they were battered by an earth-slip at Arabbada Kanda in 2012.
He provided shelter in the Temple to all who had suffered and provided food and clothes to well over 500 persons, including children, and made feel comfortable and safe at the temple premises. He looked after them without any support from the State or any agencies. On May 21, 1961, Ven. Narada Thera was born to the family of Brahammanage Jamis Sinno and Wadanambe Aracchilage Jene Nona and was ordained at the age of 14, on March 28, 1975, at the Pushparamaya Temple, Thoranakada, Eheliyagoda.
This was done at the request made by the Chief Monk Ven. Bulugahapitiye Dhammalankara Thera of the Amarapura Nikaya of Ekneligoda Sect, who happened to be his uncle, and the brother of his father.
He received higher ordination in 1981. He continued his studies at the Sudharmarama Pirivena at Avissawella and Kalyana Pradeepa Pirivena, Delgoda, Completing his university studies, he obtained his BA Degree and Post Graduate Diploma, from the Kelaniya University.
Well versed in both Japanese and Russian languages, he joined the Paligala College teaching staff at Eheliyagoda National School where he served children for 22 years.
The Pushparamaya Temple today is one of the most outstanding temples in the region, providing all facilities which includes a community hall to conduct social and religious functions and two-storey and three-storey buildings within the premises to accommodate resident monks and visiting monks.
He is an exemplary teacher to the students who came under his shade and I am much privileged to have come under the influence of this very pious and humble monk, my teacher in my formative years, and I treasure the times I spent with him, my tutor, under whose protection and guidance, I learnt to become a monk myself, and I owe him much to the position I hold today as the executive head of Daham Handa - Help International Centre at Pattivila.
I wish him good health and the blessing of the Triple Gem to continue his good work!

Fall of the word suite
Once much muscular, the library should be the second best L word we turned to when we wanted to know more about the best L word: love. Most among us are still fond of libraries. To see them closed down will be beyond our imagination. In reality, however, it is happening right now. Worse, most libraries constitutionally formulated are yet to be open. The much muscular libraries are now fast shrinking. Blame the smart devices for all that!
The notion that computers have made the library obsolete was much thicker than Google.
Authority delegated
Vijaya Premadarshana.
Picture by Saman Sri Wedage.
The library structure of Sri Lanka underwent a drastic change with the introduction of the Thirteenth Amendment to the 1978 Constitution. The Amendment introduced nine provinces. As a result, controlling authority of the library hitherto vested with the central government was delegated to the nine provinces. The provincial councils had to shoulder the development of libraries and museums. The provincial library services boards and central libraries were introduced.
Assistant Director of National Library Services and Documentation Board, Vijaya Premadarshana has undertaken a research on the development of provincial central libraries for his postgraduate studies. The provincial library concept has been materialised in only four provinces so far with five provinces yet to witness the concept materialise.
Although it seems like a novel concept, it was originally initiated towards the beginning of the 90 decade and is undergoing a slow growth. The public awareness of the library chain is quite meagre. Before studying about the provincial central libraries, we need to explore the history of Sri Lankan libraries. The Sri Lankan history of libraries could be traced as far back as 1 BC. The initiation was the printing of Buddhist teachings which were up to this point has come in oral form. There have been several pothgul as a result. Many pothguls were attached to Maha Viharaya, Abhayagiriya and Jetawanarama.
Under the Amendment, the Chief Ministers were instructed to supervise these libraries. Accordingly the provinces of Uva, Central, Sabaragamuwa and North Central have provincial library services boards.
Traditional procedures
The traditional government procedures have made things difficult in implementing the concept. The relevant officials who were trained in implementing the concept have been transferred and their replacements remain clueless about the mission and the vision of the concept.
Each of these provincial libraries should be maintained as a research hub. All the information you require should be available here. The officers should be qualified, Premadarshana said.
The concept is introduced to streamline the research process. The provincial researchers are not compelled to reach Colombo to gather information. The tourists will also be benefitted with the easy access available in every province  if only the concept is implemented.
A number of measures should be undertaken. Training the officials is one. Preserving ancient documents is another. These libraries can apply for foreign funds as well. Sadly none of that really happens. The relevant authorities have no idea on how to implement the concept, he noted.
Despite the high level of Sri Lankas literacy, Premadarshana opines that the same is not visible in the library phenomenon. Literacy level is not a good measure of the education growth. Although a majority is capable of reading, whether the reading matter is serious or not remains questionable. Most small-scale libraries do not have serious reading matter owing to the lack of properly qualified officers.
Literacy level
The academic publications have a little readership. When it comes to fiction, the people prefer silly novels to classic ones. The people utilise their literacy level only to browse the simple reading materials. These materials mostly include sentimental novels. That does not enhance their lifestyles.
On the other hand, the English reading section of most libraries is vacant. The communities cannot be blamed, for that would be stepping out of the comfort zone. To encourage more readers to the English sections, Premadarshana recommends basic English courses which will be resourceful in inculcating the reading habit.
The physical libraries are slowly becoming a thing of the past. It is a shift from the traditional physical libraries to a technological involvement.
Traditional library
01. Emphasis on storage and preservation of physical items, particularly books and periodicals
02. Cataloguing at a high level rather than one of detail, e.g., author and subject indexes as opposed to full text
03. Browsing based on physical proximity of related materials, e.g., books on sociology are near one another on the shelves
04. Passivity; information is physically assembled in one place; users must travel to the library to learn what is there and make use of it
Digital library
01. Emphasis on access to digitized materials wherever they may be located, with digitization eliminating the need to own or store a physical item
02. Cataloguing down to individual words or glyphs
03. Browsing based on hyperlinks, keyword, or any defined measure of relatedness; materials on the same subject do not need to be near one another in any physical sense
04. Broadcast technology; users need not visit a digital library except electronically; for them, the library exists at any place they can access it,e.g., home, school, office, or in a car
05. Everything can be stored. The total number of different books produced since printing began does not exceed one billion. (The number of books now published annually is less than one million.) If an average book occupies 500 pages at 2,000 characters per page, then even without compression it can be stored comfortably in one megabyte. Therefore, one billion megabytes are sufficient to store all books. This is 1015 bytes or one petabyte.

Female labour force increases to 83%
The female labour force participation in Sri Lanka has increased to 83% in the third quarter of 2017.
It has been observed that the labour female participation rate (LFPR) has risen due to several reasons. These include thousands of job openings in the job market, availability of secure and permanent full-time jobs, increase in education levels, quality jobs with clear career prospects and on-discrimination in the labour market.
The online recruitment platforms that keep on emerging in Sri Lanka has also contributed to reduce the unemployment rate within the country.
In addition greater number of the women are showing interest to enter to the labor market now as they get the opportunity to balance work-family relationship as there are many day care facilities with security for their children and also better transport options.
In addition the different type of job categories and the high salary rates also encourage women to join the labour market, said Manager - Public Relations, DreamJobs.lk Priyanka Perera

Fifth Harmony taking hiatus to pursue solo careers
Fifth Harmony are taking an indefinite hiatus in order to "pursue solo endeavours". Originally composed of Ally Brooke Hernandez, Normani Kordei, Dinah Jane, Lauren Jauregui and Camila Cabello, the girl group rose to fame in 2012 after finishing third on the second season of U.S. singing competition The X Factor, later releasing hit tunes such as Worth It and Work from Home.
However, following Camila's exit in late 2016 and both Ally and Normani snapping up solo contracts in recent months, the popstars have decided to take a break.
"After six years going hard, non-stop, we also realised that in order to stay authentic to ourselves and to you, we do need to take some time for now to go on a hiatus from Fifth Harmony in order to pursue solo endeavours," the group said in a statement posted on their Instagram page on March 19.
The quartet went on to express gratitude to their fans, known as Harmonizers, and also confirmed that they would honour existing dates to be held as part of their PSA Tour. Fifth Harmony is due to perform at the Hard Rock Event Center, in Hollywood, Florida on May 11, in San Juan, Puerto Rico on 13 May, and in Reykjavik, Iceland on 16 May. Rolling Stone

Foreign Exchange Act to simplify tight regulations - CBSL
The new Foreign Exchange Act would further simplify tight regulations that were in place, said Assistant Governor, Central Bank of Sri Lanka, Yvette Fernando.
She was speaking at the Public - Private Sector Dialogue on Overcoming the Regulatory and Compliance Challenges in the Banking Sector seminar organized by Ceylon Chamber of Commerce yesterday. She said that there wont be any taxes on Sri Lankans working overseas and bringing back their earnings to Sri Lanka. Only a remittance fee of 1% will be charged and that too for over US$ 1 million.
She said that if these earning are reinvested in Sri Lanka there would not be a remittance fee.
Fernando disclosed that over the years the controls for foreign earnings and investments have been relaxed and today one does not have to go to obtain Central Bank approval for every single transaction.
Meanwhile Reyaz Mihular, Managing Partner KPMG Sri Lanka, who made the key note address said the new financial regulations introduced recently have created issues for the banking sector. He said they are yet to find out if the new regulations were coming in to effect from the financial year commencing April or from the beginning of the year.
He also said that some of the tax exemptions enjoyed by the banks have been taken off.
Mihular also expressed dissatisfaction with regard to lack of data in public domains. These make future planning and investments more difficult and more time consuming. In contrast in foreign countries there is data in abundance which make companys planning more easy and economical.
CFO, Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC, Nandika Buddhipala said today the bulk of the deposits in banks were from senior citizens. We hope that (senior citizens) would not be asked to give expiations and charged high taxes each time they want to make withdrawals. (SS)

Framework for licensing electricians
The Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka together with CEB, LECO, CIDA, IESL and VTA organized a seminar to gather public opinion on proposed framework for licensing electricians in Sri Lanka.
The event was held on March 22 at the BMICH, with the participation of intellectuals, professionals, academics, entrepreneurs, industrialists and electricians from various parts of the Country.
There were 51 presentations by the cross section of professionals in all levels of the relevant field under various topics to emphasize the necessity of the Licensing Framework.
According to the proposal there are four types of licensing, apprentice- low voltage, under supervision of a licensed electrician( LV up to 1,000 volts), residential electricians, electrical work from instilling lights to complete wiring of a house (LV up to 1000 volts- three phase 30 Amps.), commercial electricians, work on large and critical electrical projects, security, power and fire protection, utility electronics in buildings (LV three phase 60 Amps and above.) and master/ premier electricians
The master / premier electricians are the most qualified level of an electrician.
They work on both commercial and residential jobs and supervise other electricians.
At this forum it was revealed that working with electricity can be very dangerous and faulty wiring poses several hazards, especially fire and it was statistically around 90% when compared to other services like plumbing (65%) and mechanical (20%).
Emphasis was made on the necessity to prevent unqualified people practicing as electricians, and to provide practical safeguard measures to protect the public, workmen and property, and also to make the public and all interested parties aware of the individuals who are suitably qualified, competent and have the requisite expertise to perform as electricians. Dr. Sarath Kumara , Senior Lecturer and Course Director of the Kelani Saviya ( Kelani Cables /UoP Joint CSR program) ,University of Peradeniya, Channa Jayasinghe Senior Manager, Brand Development ,Kelani Cables Plc, Jayantha Wijesinghe Coordinator Kelani Saviya ,Professor Laksman R Watawala, Dr.Chandana Jayalath, Kosala Kamburudeniya , Eng(Dr. ) Lional Pinto, Dr.DDD Suraweera and several more eminent professionals participate for the event.

FTZ Manufacturers look for more conducive regulations
Manufacturers are the backbone of the countrys economy. The government too has realized this by providing various incentives and introducing policies, said Free Trade Zone Manufacturers' (FTZMA) Association Chairman Fazal Abdeen addressing the 38th AGM in Seeduwa recently.
"However introducing policies alone is not sufficient. We also need consistency in terms of policies and regulations in order to plan ahead. we need to look at a longer term and a bigger picture always," he said after being reappointed as FTZMA Chairman for 2018-2019.
He opined that Sri Lanka had the necessary resources and motivation to emerge as a strong competitor in the global apparel market. What the country needed was the decisive juncture in the gentle push from the government in the form of steady consistent policies that will serve to make the country appealing in the eyes of deserving investors.
"We hail the present regime for working to bring back the GSP Plus concessions which is sure to benefit the manufacturing and exports sectors of the country. While the government is working to make conditions conducive for manufacturers however we believe that it is equally important to ensure communal harmony among diverse religious and ethnic groups of Sri Lanka. We strongly believe that Sri Lanka will be able to reap the optimum benefits of the robust economic development only if we set aside differences and work on one common goal of being a developed nation in the near future," he cautioned
The Chairman said since its inception the association had shrived hard to satisfy the needs of its members who have ably selected teams from time to time to manage the affairs of FTZMA.
Abdeen said the association fondly remembered the past and senior members who made invaluable sacrifices to put Sri Lanka on the map as a competitive manufacturer that is synonymous with quality, if not for their passion and vision coupled with and determination and dedication, the countrys economy would not be what it was today.
FTZMA also paid tribute to Neil Umagiliya, who has announced his retirement from the industry, for the yeoman contribution done to the industry.

## Title: Fuel prices
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Tuesday, March 27, 2018 - 01:00
Fuel prices
The LIOC has decided to raise fuel prices but not so the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation. According to CPC Chairman Dhammika Ranatunga, they will not increase fuel prices at present or in the future. Lanka IOC could not bear any further losses and therefore the company decided to marginally increase the selling prices. Still, full losses have not been passed onto the customer, he stated in a communique. The price increase by LIOC is a nominal Rs. 5 for petrol and Rs.9 per litre for diesel, effective from midnight last Friday.
The LIOC market share is very limited and is confined to merely 100 fuel stations. Hence, this will not have much of an impact on motorists who, according to reports, are now having their fuel pumped at CPC run fuel stations, in increasing numbers. This in turn could swell the coffers of the CPC which is perennially in the red, but not to the extent of overcoming the massive losses it has incurred due to the generous subsidies dished out to the public, since the advent of Yahapalanaya, and due to the massive sums owed to it by state institutions.
The LIOC has been requesting for a price revision for sometime now and the increase in the dollar rate vis-a-vis the rupee must have certainly forced its hand. It is not known for how long the CPC will be able to resist an upward revision of fuel prices, given the circumstances.
Be that as it may, the Yahapalanaya government should be commended for reducing fuel prices, even incurring massive losses in doing so, since it assumed office three years ago. This was in sharp contrast to Mahinda Rajapaksa who increased the fuel prices even when the world price of crude oil had dropped drastically, during the tenure of his regime. It introduced a fuel price formula merely to throw dust in the eyes of the public. Fuel prices were jacked up when prices rose in the world market but when the prices plummeted no corresponding decrease was effected.
The reduction in the fuel prices under the present regime went to a large extent in cushioning the cost of living burden on the populous. Today, the Joint Opposition keeps on talking about the VAT imposed on the people and points to this being the chief reason for the increase in the CoL. It fails to talk about the massively subsidized fuel prices, but for which the CoL would have shot up into the stratosphere. The government, for its part, failed to drive home this point even during the local government election campaign and paid a huge price for it. At least now it should inform the people of the benefits that accrued to them by maintaining fuel prices at such a low level.
According to a report, during the last year alone the CPC had incurred a total loss of Rs. 5460 million on the sale of kerosene, as a loss of Rs. 48 was incurred on each litre which was sold at a subsidized price of Rs. 44. Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga stated, the loss incurred in the sale of kerosene during the first two months of the current year stood at Rs.2146 million. Accordingly, the annual loss on the sale of kerosene has been estimated at Rs.12,876 million. How long it can keep on incurring such losses is the question.
However, the government will have little option but to continue with the present fuel subsidy, the removal of which will have a knockdown effect on the general price structure of almost all goods and services and be politically costly for the government, what with provincial council elections round the corner. The first to be affected will be transport costs which will have a ripple effect on the prices of even the simplest of items such as vegetables. The private bus owners will lose no time in demanding an increase in bus fares to be followed by tri-shaw operators. An increase in diesel prices would also see a surge in electricity bills, what with 60% of power generation dependent on thermal power, the prolonged drought further complicating matters. Norochcholai also seems to be still having hiccups, not operating to its full capacity. It is time that the government considers exploring the prospects of alternative energy. Many possibilities such as wind energy had been in the pipeline for a long period but nothing seems to have moved out of the blueprint stage.
Urgent steps should also taken to avert a fuel crisis like the one witnessed by the country some six months ago, which also had its spinoff effects on the local government election results. Poor quality of the imported fuel was blamed for non issuance of fuel to the filling stations. The Minister, no doubt, would have been mindful of the earlier occasion when contaminated fuel was distributed during the former regime, forcing the government to pay out heavy compensation for the damaged vehicles. The quality of the fuel should be tested prior to the origination of the shipments. There is also the urgent need for increasing the storage capacity to meet any contingency.

Government to create three BOI zones
The government will speed up creating three new Board of Investment (BOI) zones at Bingiriya, Mawathagama, Milleniya and Charlimount (Matara).
A budgetary allocation of Rs. 2.5 billion has beeng approved to develop these new zones.
This was disclosed at a BOI held investor facilitation and networking event at the Cinnamon Lakeside Hotel to engage in a dialogue with investors in Sri Lanka who have re-invested in Sri Lanka. By confirming their trust in Sri Lanka and in the Board, these investors had sent a very positive message to potential investors both in Sri Lanka and overseas.
At the function the audience which consisted of nearly 200 existing investors who had opted to reinvest in the country were addressed by Chief Guest Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Malik Samarawickrama, Minister of Development Strategies and other BOI members. In recent times the BOI has identified existing investors as a major potential source for future investments in the country.
Hence more investor friendly mechanisms are being set up to fast track the approval and implementation of projects are additional reasons and the fact that there are currently more opportunities to invest in new areas.
Also new liberalized laws covering the foreign exchange regime, simplified taxation laws that reduce upfront costs and efforts to improve facilitation are also important considerations. The BOI strategy in that respect is to identify specific targeted sectors for reinvestment and then actively promote it with the investor to expand his/her investment.
In addition the BOI has been engaged in facilitation which includes identifying new lands for new zones to channel the investor to that location. The reinvestment strategy of the BOI focuses mainly on developing the manufacturing sector which is the main target with a strong emphasis on attracting electronics, industrial machinery, automotive, electrical equipment, food products and pharmaceutical to name just a few.
Furthermore, reinvestment is also sought in services which are also promoted including IT and software development, BPOs, tourism and education.
BOI has also set up a new reinvestment team which has identified several activities that will encourage reinvestment. Firstly this would include communicating with companies which are known to be pleased with investing in Sri Lanka as well as some of the largest investors in term of the value of investments, exports or employment generated. Another consideration of the reinvestment team of the BOI is to encourage new investors like their suppliers or partners in the supply chain to invest by using the good offices of existing investors.

Honour among the corrupt
In Sri Lanka, we still think that the only method to deal with crime is to prosecute a suspect, spending the countrys money and resources, which may drag on for years. This is the system we have inherited from the British. However, we not only do not practise prevention methods, our legal system is totally void of any preventative measures to curb crime, prior to it occurring, and these preventions are not even taught in law colleges. This is because we practise the adversarial system. We are of the notion that if we punish perpetrators and punish them severely, then others would be careful and stay away from committing crimes. However trends are now changing and the world is now looking at measures to prevent crimes, instead of waiting until it happens.
Last year 57 convictions were done with regard to corruption cases, said the Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC), Sarath Jayamanne PC.
In an interview with the Daily News, he said last year CIABOC had filed 73 cases, while 51 were arrested over accepting of bribes. In all 2,768 complaints had been received by CIABOC last year. So far this year CIABOC has filed around nine cases and carried out 11 successful raids, having received 605 complaints to date this year.
However, he said in most instances, these people who accept bribes are aware that the bribery commission is nabbing those involved, but still, the urge to make that extra buck, makes them do it anyways.
Meanwhile, one of the main reasons identified in punishing those who engage in bribery or corruption is the delay in prosecutions. He noted that by the time the cases are filed and cases drag on, in most instances, by the end of years of investigations and delayed legal processes, the culprits get away due to various reasons. Previously, bribery cases were only heard in the Magistrates Courts, which is the lowest of the courts, and due to the daunting number of cases that are filed and investigated, these cases invariably pile up. But, now measures are being taken to address these issues that hamper the delay in completing these cases by revising some of the acts to facilitate the speedy completion of these cases.
Corruption cases
CIABOC has taken measures to resolve the piling number of cases through several amendments to the existing acts, completing the hundreds of thousands of piled up cases. Three acts are to be amended, pertaining to the judicial activities, bribery and corruption and public servants activities, replacing the old laws with revised and productive new ones. Accordingly, based on these amendments, all courts procedures from the Magistrates Court up will be changed, he said.
According to Director General Sarath Jayamanne, so far all corruption cases were only taken up by the Magistrates Courts and due to this loophole in the legal system, during the past 23 years, while over around 100-200 cases were filed, only four persons were convicted and received punishments amounting to ten years imprisonment. However, according to the new amendments, no case will be dragged on for many years and would be heard continuously and expedited.
Cases that are determined to be heard before the AG or Bribery Commission or a three-member judge panel will be heard without a break until a final verdict is completed, thanks to the new revisions to the act. Due to the delay in conducting these cases, in most instances, the evidence is lost, witnesses go missing or they die, suspects flee, officials change, documents get misplaced etc. and by these delays, sometimes even the severest criminals escape the grasp of the law, resulting in further injustice to the affected parties. Among the piled up cases, there are cases that have been delayed for over 20 years. Hence, even the President noted that this mechanism needs drastic changes. The proposed amendments would allow evidence gathered by a presidential commission to be valid before court reducing the repetition of the process of gathering evidence saving time and resources and expediting the judicial process, he noted.
However, he noted that in most of these cases, around 75 percent of the complaints are without evidence and grievances rather than substantial complaints. Therefore, he appealed to the public to refrain from sending in such complaints as it is a waste of public resources as these baseless complaints too should be investigated prior to being discarded wasting valuable time and resources.
Through the amendments, most of the laws pertaining to the 1988 Bribery Act would be revised. Through these amendments, the loopholes that thus existed would be closed leaving no room for offenders to creep through them and escape punishment. These amendments have now received Cabinet approval and currently measures are being taken by the legal draftsman to initiate necessary action, he added.
However, he said these measures alone are insufficient to prevent corruption as it is now embedded in the genes of the people of this country. In many instances, knowing that they are bound to get caught, state employees still take bribes. I wonder if they simply dont care that they would be arrested. Sri Lanka is among the four most corrupt countries in the world because of this. Hence, if we are to prevent corruption in this country, we need to change the thinking of the people and we need to change the way we think at the school level. Countries such as Singapore were in a worse state than us, but today they have emerged as one of the least corrupt nations. It is one of the worlds wealthiest countries. This is mainly because their state service is the least corrupt. In fact, they take great pride that their public sector is corruption free. Despite this fact, they have also put mechanisms in place to make corruption or bribing impossible. Their procedures are all very transparent leaving no room for corruption, he pointed out.
Government institutions
In fact, Singapores population density is far greater than Sri Lanka. Still, the crime rates are far lower. In Singapore, the population density per kilometre is around 6,000, Hong Kong around 4,000 but in Sri Lanka, our population density is only 325. These other countries are concrete jungles without any natural resources, but still, they have made it to the highest position. They have achieved this by just their perseverance and honesty. Their brand name is the honesty of their public servants. To date, Singapore is ranked as the highest in honest public service.
Jayamanne further noted that the main reason for corruption to take place in this country is the eye-to-eye interaction between the government official and the public. The main reason for bribing happens when the officer is aware that the civilian coming to that department to get a job done is unaware of the system and he deliberately delays the process practically forcing the civilian to pay a bribe in order to expedite his requirement. This can be stopped by minimising the direct contact between the officials of government institutions and the general public and making the whole process transparent leaving no room for bribing. For this online methods can be initiated where the process can be streamlined and transparent.
Responding to allegations that the Bribery Commission is only after the small fries while the big fish gets away, Jayamanne said in many of these cases where people term small fish is where the wronged are helpless innocent people. Hence it is not a matter of small or big fish our country should be rid of corruption of all sorts. With the new amendments to the Bribery Act, CIABOC act and the Declaration of Assets and Liabilities Act, we also gave a schedule that was presented to parliament by the President and approval was granted. Currently, we are in the process of going through the details together with the legal draftsman.
Meanwhile, while a lot is being done by CIABOC under the leadership of its Director General and to expedite cases of large-scale corruption and fraud, an appeal was made to allow these cases to be taken up in the high court and the president had presented this proposal to the Cabinet and having obtained approval, it is scheduled to be presented to parliament for approval shortly. Now there is a law that says cases cannot pile up. In terms of cases where either the Attorney General or the Bribery Commissioner has recommended be heard before a three-member judge panel, it is stipulated that these cases be heard continuously and completed in a short span without letting these cases drag on for years, he said.
Lack of space to accommodate staff
However, the Director General of the Bribery Commission lamented that while much is being done to facilitate the quick processing of these bribery or corruption cases, one of the biggest stumbling blocks they face is the lack of space to accommodate its staff.
We have now got approval to recruit around 50 independent investigators, but accommodating them without space is the biggest challenge. Previously too since a section of outbuilding collapsed, I had to house some of our employees at the old Registration of Persons office. But they want us to leave that building as well. Where do I now accommodate these workers We made a request to the Urban Development Authority to grant us a land that is adjacent to this office, but despite the President and Prime Ministers approval, they are reluctant to grant us this land for some unknown reason. Instead, they request us to move to Battaramulla. This is a counterproductive move as we deal mainly with the courts which are based in Colombo and moving to Battaramulla will waste a lot of time on the roads, whereas from this current location at Boudhaloka Mawatha it takes a mere 12-20 minutes to get to the courts, he pointed out.
It is no secret that countries that have grown socially and economically are those that have combated corruption. They follow a method of exposing those corrupt and mainly by inculcating in the hearts and minds of the people that bribery and corruption are wrong. Only once we learn to accept this and act with the responsibility that we will be able to rid this country of corruption.

India imposes minimum import price on pepper
Effective December 6, 2017, the Government of India has introduced a minimum import price (MIP) for pepper of Indian rupees 500 per kg which works out to USD 7,700 per mt.
As the Sri Lankan pepper market is around USD 4,600 it is not feasible for importers in India to import pepper because of this MIP.
This is another measure introduced by India to prevent imports of pepper which is allowed under the Free Trade Agreement. Besides, shipments that have been made earlier are also being subjected to considerable delay, in their clearance.

Indian High Commission organises GST workshop
At the request of government of Sri Lanka, the High Commission of India organised a workshop on Goods and Service Tax (GST), at the Taj Samudra, Colombo, on March 23.
A three-member delegation from Central Board of Excise and Customs (CBEC), government of India, headed by Commissioner Upendra Gupta conducted the workshop. Director General, Department of Commerce, government of Sri Lanka, Sonali Wijeratne and Indian Deputy High Commissioner Arindam Bagchi were also present.
Several officials from various ministries and departments in Sri Lanka, representatives of the trade chambers, and members from the industry were also present. The discussions highlighted the fact that Sri Lankan exporters will now have access to hitherto unexplored markets of various states in India, thanks to uniform rates of taxation all over India under the new GST Act.
Launched in July 2017, GST is hailed as Indias biggest tax reform since independence. GST has resulted in economic integration of India, by subsuming more than a dozen State and Central levies into one tax.
GST has unified 29 states of India into a common national market for the first time. GST has also substantially increased ease of doing business in India. The new tax system has mitigated cascading effects in taxation as well as ensured transparency, certainty and simplicity.
The new GST system will bring down the cost of imports and exports for Sri Lanka from and to India.
Traders based in Sri Lanka will not have to bear the cost of any indirect tax except the basic Customs duty and social welfare surcharge applicable.
Traders in India can now claim GST paid on imported goods as tax credit from the government of India.
More information on GST could be obtained from www.cbec.gov.in/htdocs-cbec/gst/index.

JHU will not support NCM
The Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) will not support the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, JHU General Secretary and Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at the JHU Head Office in Battaramulla yesterday, the minister said the NCM mainly revolves around the Central Bank Treasury Bonds issue which the Government has already tackled head-on.
From the beginning of this issue, we were of the opinion that a fraud had been committed and those culprits must be brought to book. The Government has already addressed this matter and legal action has been initiated. Presenting the Judicature (Amendment) Bill, the Government has also proposed to refer the CB bond case to one of the separate high courts on corruption and financial crimes.
Financial crimes severe than the bond scam had been committed under the previous regime. The MiG aircraft deal and the fraud involving Entrust Securities Plc are fine examples, the minister said.
At the same time, the minister stressed on the need for urgent reforms to the Government as well as the UNP, if the country is to move forward. The outcome of recent LG polls is a slap in the face of Government for not acting in line with the peoples mandate received on January 8, 2015. However, we still have time for a course correction. I have presented a 45-point proposal to the Cabinet stating the urgent measures needed within next 18 months.
I await feedback of the ministers at the next Cabinet meeting. We cannot depend on traditional hands to execute this set of proposals. A Working Committee comprised of young blood is needed, he commented.
A clear change in the policies of the Government is a must. We have instructed the Government to be extra-cautious not to engage in self-destructive activities, Deputy Minister Karunarathna Paranavithana said. JHU President Ven. Hedigalle Wimalasara Thera and its National Organizer Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe also participated.

LANKA PROPERTY WEB INTRODUCES AGENT VERIFICATION
Lanka Property Web.com, Sri Lankas number one property website has introduced an Agent Verification programme for estate agents and brokers. The programme would carry out a rigorous check on participating estate agents and brokers against 20 criteria. If the agent successfully passes the test, they would be awarded a Verified Agent certificate and would be listed as Verified Agents on the website valid for one year.
The programme was launched so that genuine companies and individuals in the real estate trade are given a platform to validate their credentials and trustworthiness to the potential customers that they will be dealing with. As there is no official certification process for agents and brokers in Sri Lanka, Lanka Property Web hopes that this service will help agents showcase their trustworthiness and reputation to the public.
The verification process, which involves 20 checks, will be carried out by Lanka Property Web. These include checking the ownership of the business, verifying the address and contact details of the business establishment, and the feedback it has received from customers about the agent. This process is on par with similar verification programmes carried out in other parts of the world.
The first such agent to pass the verification process was Menavid (Pvt) Ltd and their certificate was handed over by the Managing Director of Lanka Property Web at a recently held function.
Daham Gunaratna, Managing Director of Lanka Property Web stated that Menavid has been in the real estate industry since 1980 and has built a good reputation and trust for itself throughout the years and it was fitting that they were the first recipients of the certification. Stressing the importance of such a programme, he further stated that Lanka Property Web stepped into offer this certification in response to the lack of an official certification for agents in the country and that securing such a certification would help agents to highlight their reputation and trust to the public.
Commenting further on the new programme, Gunaratna stated that, This would be another value-added service that we provide to property buyers, sellers, landlords and tenants to make it easier for them to find genuine and trustworthy agents to handle their property needs. This will in turn offer a multitude of benefits for property seekers."
It was also mentioned that several other agents are currently participating in the verification process.
Managing Director of Menavid (Pvt) Ltd Rimza Zaveer said,  Lanka Property Webs recent verification process has helped us to be recognised as a dependable and trustworthy Agent in Sri Lanka and will help the public to determine whether they are dealing with reliable Agents

Lawyer files written submissions against BASL petition
Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku yesterday filed written submissions against a Special Determination petition filed by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) which challenged the proposed amendments to the Judicature Act.
Seven Special Determination petitioners, including the BASL, challenging the constitutionality of the Bill entitled Judicature (Amendment), a Bill to amend the Judicature Act No.2 of 1978 had been filed in the Supreme Court.
The intervention petitioner Kodituwakku states that he was challenging the petition of the BASL on the basis that the said petition is totally misconceived and without any basis on the following grounds. The President of the BASL U.R. de Silva has appeared before the Parliamentary oversight committee on the formulation of a policy framework for the proposed amendment to the Judicature Act to set up the new court, the High Court at Bar to deal with specific offences, and even in discussions on the Bill.
In December 2017, the President of the BASL had appeared before the Oversight Committee in looking into the draft Bill to amend the Judicature Act and has pledged to cooperate with the move to conduct day-to-day proceedings to avoid inordinate delay of cases. Kodituwakku further said it is learnt that throughout the parliamentary oversight process into the draft legislation, the President of the BASL had been part of the deliberations, with the Associations Treasurer also taking part in consultations.
He said the proposed Bill comes in response to public outcry for speedy delivery of justice in cases of serious crimes particularly involving public funds compelling the government to establish a High Court at Bar which should have been a priority for the Government elected to office by the people in August 2015.
The intervention petitioner said under the Amendment, there will be a permanent High Court sitting at bar, meaning it would comprise a three-judge bench to which the Attorney General and the Director General of the Bribery Commission can refer cases. The criteria for referring cases is set out in the Bill, and it is only in serious matters that the cases will be referred to the High Court at Bar. The three judges to the High Court at Bar will be appointed by the Judicial Services Commission. It is essentially a Provincial High Court, permanently sitting at bar consisting of three judges.
Finally, Kodituwakku stated that the amendment proposed to the Judicature Act to set up the permanent High Court at Bar to try corruption and complex financial crimes and other serious criminal offences as set out in the Sixth Schedule to the Bill, does not require a two thirds majority and a referendum to be enacted, since the Bill does not violate any of the provisions as set out in Article 83 of the Constitution.
He moved Supreme Court to declare, that the Bill titledJudicature (Amendment) Bill does not require a two thirds majority and a referendum to be enacted, since any of the provisions in the said Bill does not violate any of the Articles as set out in Article 83 of the Constitution.
The Supreme Courts determination over the proposed Bill is to be communicated to the Speaker in due course.

Legal action against illegal scheme house sellers
Since there is information that some of the houses coming up in the Naula Arangala Watta Housing Scheme funded by the NHDA have been sold to outside parties by the beneficiaries themselves, the CID will be called into probe the matter and bring the offenders to book, Matale District Parliamentarian Kumari Kaviratne said.
Kaviratne, who visited the housing scheme on an inspection tour on March 25 said, 62 houses are coming up in the housing scheme with the beneficiaries contributing the labour and financial assistance being extended by the NHDA.
However, there were allegations that some of the beneficiaries had sold their half completed houses to third parties and this is an irregularity which should needs to be probed.
Kaviratne, who said that beneficiaries of the housing scheme had still not been granted titles inquired from the acting District Manager of the NHDA who was present, whether beneficiaries had the possibility to sell their houses to others. Since the District Manager informed her that such a possibility was available, Kaviratne said illegal transactions could not be permitted in low income group housing schemes launched by the government and said if such transactions had occurred in the housing scheme, legal action would be taken against the perpetrators irrespective of their positions.

Mitigating corruption is possible
During his address to a group of newly elected members to the Colombo Municipal Council recently, Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe made an apt remark. He said, Some politicians own only a push bicycle when they come to politics but later obtain Benz cars. Dont think of becoming such politicians.
Prime Minister is correct. During the past five decades we have seen how some corrupted politicians began to grow within a short period in power  in terms of bank accounts, properties, trade and finance and asset base. Their immediate families, too, followed suit.
It is consoling to note that the Prime Minister has understood this burning issue very well.
Corruption
Corruption is a much-hackneyed word in our country. Party orators and writers, journalists, and reformers all have used it with the utmost freedom. Popular disgust is frequently expressed at the lack of political will to take appropriate action and the deviousness of the law's procedure. The recent LG election result is one of the classic examples of the peoples disappointment.
Corruption is not confined to Sri Lanka. Political power is abused wherever it exists - with scandals ranging from political graft in India to white collar crime on Wall Street to bribery of government regulators in China.
Is corruption just a matter of legality, of financial irregularity and bribery, or is it the currency of a social transaction in an outrageous unequal society, in which power continues to be concentrated in the hands of a smaller minority of politicians and businessmen Does the solution to the problems faced by ordinary people lie in addressing the structural inequality, or in creating yet another power structure to control a massive corrupted structure
For long term solution, these questions need to be answered. But, in the short term, what we need today is to think of reform options to reduce corruption and mitigate its effects.
Reforms
We must, first of all, understand that there is no silver bullet for fighting corruption. Many countries have made significant progress in curbing corruption; however, practitioners are always on the lookout for better solutions with evidence of impact.
Susan Rose-Ackerman, Professor of Jurisprudence (Law and Political Science), recommends a two-pronged strategy aimed at increasing the benefits of being honest and the costs of being corrupt, a sensible combination of reward and punishment as the driving force of reforms.
To work on her theory, we have to consider few relevant points.
Are public servants in Sri Lanka appropriately compensated Only a comprehensive research would reveal the answer. If salaries and wages are too low, public servants may find themselves under pressure to supplement their incomes in unofficial ways. A research done by an international body has shown that there is an inverse relationship between the level of public sector emoluments and the incidence of corruption.
There are various ways in which the government manages public resources: subsidies, tax exemptions, public procurement, soft credits, extra-budgetary funds etc. But the common denominator is all of them are under the control of politicians. Government will collect taxes, tap the capital market to raise money, receives foreign aid and develops mechanisms to allocate these resources to satisfy a multiplicity of needs.
Some countries do this in ways that are relatively transparent and make efforts to ensure that resources will be used in the public interest.
The more open and transparent the process, the less opportunity it will provide for wrongdoing and abuse. Countries where citizens are able to scrutinize government activities and debate the merits of various public policies also makes a difference.
New Zealand, for example, is one of the top performers in Transparency Internationals Corruption Perceptions Index.
They were pioneers in creating transparent budget processes. In 1994 they implemented the Fiscal Responsibility Act, providing a legal framework for transparent management of public resources.
Red tape
Research has also revealed that there is a high correlation between the incidence of corruption and the extent of bureaucratic red tape. It is therefore desirable to eliminate as much as possible the needless regulations while safeguarding the essential regulatory functions of the Government. For example, there is a plethora of PRs and FRs which are extremely burdensome to genuine users. Strangely, none of our governments have paused to examine whether the purpose for which these regulations were introduced is at all relevant to the needs of today.
International conventions
Most of the big-time corruptions have a cross-border dimensions. That is why the international legal framework for corruption control is a key element among the options open to any government. This framework has improved significantly over the past decade. Take for example, (UNCAC) UN Convention Against Corruption.
Though Sri Lanka is a party to UNCAC, it seems that we have not made use of these legal mechanisms freely available to UNs member states to eliminate corruption and recover looted assets that have been transferred to other countries.
Sri Lanka has also signed but not ratified the UN Convention against Transnational Organized Crime. Sri Lanka is a signatory to the OECD-ADB Anti-Corruption Regional Plan but has not joined the OECD Anti-Bribery Convention.
Smart technology
Perhaps one of the most fertile sources of corruption is associated with the purchasing activities of the state. Because the awarding of contracts will involve a measure of bureaucratic discretion, more and more countries have opted for procedures that guarantee adequate levels of openness, competition, a level playing field for suppliers, fairly clear bidding procedures, and so on. They use modern information technology.
Chile is a good example about the usage of latest technologies to create one of the worlds most transparent public procurement systems in the world. Known as ChileCompra, it is a public electronic system for purchasing and hiring, based on an Internet platform. It has earned a worldwide reputation for excellence, transparency and efficiency.
Willingness
If the above-mentioned measures can be adapted in Sri Lanka, they will assist in the mitigation of corruption. The underlying philosophy is one of eliminating the opportunity for corruption by changing incentives, by closing off loopholes and eliminating misconceived rules that encourage corrupt behaviour.
But an approach that focuses solely on changing the rules and the incentives, accompanied by appropriately harsh punishment for violation of the rules, is likely to be far more effective if it is also supported by the genuine willingness of the politicians who are in the power. That was the hitch we always had.
Ethics
We also need to reinforce the moral and ethical foundation of our society. First, let us focus on our education system. Let us ensure that school and university curricula are updated and modernized in line with societal changes. We need a holistic education system for the next generation through community and religious institutions, vocational and internship opportunities, and participation in public and political processes as an integral part of socialization and development.
Closely connected to the focus on education is the need to create a culture of integrity that is hard-wired in society. While such a culture can be fostered and advanced through the comprehensive education of the next generation, there is no reason to limit such efforts to only young people.
Public servants, political leaders and private-sector actors  individually and collectively  can begin establishing and strengthening a culture of integrity that concentrates on high-quality service delivery and professional performance standards, treating individuals with respect and dignity, and  above all else  playing by the same rules of fairness and objectivity.
That means living by principles seemingly so basic and obvious as no cutting corners and not being above the law.

Music of the moment
Kavichandran Alexander does what he does with complete sincerity and with no pretension. He does what he does out of pure love for the art. He takes very little credit and just does it because he sees something beautiful in the music he archives by recording with the utmost purity. Melodies features Kavichandran Alexander, the first Sri Lankan to engineer and produce of multiple Grammy award winning recordings.
Music produced and recorded by Alexander and released on his own record label - Water Lily Acoustics, have been featured in six Hollywood films including Dead Man Walking (Sean Penn, Susan Sarandon), Angel Eyes (Jennifer Lopez), Meet the Fockers (Robert De Niro, Dustin Hoffman, Barbra Streisand) and the Bon Jovi documentary The Circle.
Alexander has recorded with many virtuosos from both the East and the West, such as Padma Vibhushan Ustad Dr. Ali Akbar Khan (Son of the Guru of Pandit Ravi Shankar), Padma Vibhushan Pandit Jasraj, Padma Bhushan Pandit V.G. Jog (Guru of Pandit Amaradeva) and numerous others.
He is the first Asian, to both produce and record major symphony orchestras, such as the Philadelphia Orchestra, The Saint Petersburg Philharmonic, The Saint Petersburg Symphony and the Hungarian National Philharmonic.
I started my company Water Lily Acoustics with the goal of recording and preserving the traditional music of both the East and the West, with a strong emphasis on the music of the Sub Continent. I like to listen to the classical music of Asia - the Hindustani and Carnatic music of India, Arab classical music, Iranian classical music, Chinese classical music and Japanese classical music.
Performing with other artistes
What I found, from listening to these great classical traditions of the East, was that, in most cases, the recordings I listened to, did not match the sonic quality of the recordings made of the Western virtuosos. I also felt that the Asian traditions were not being recorded properly. I wanted to change this situation, I felt that this would be my goal and calling in life. Thus was born Water Lily Acoustics, named in honor of my dear mother Lily, who was the very first musician that I heard said Alexander.
In the beginning Alexander was recording primarily Indian classical music, both Hindustani and Carnatic, starting with a recording of the greatest Indian musician of our times  Padma Vibhushan Ustad Dr. Ali Akbar Khan. This initial recording of the great master lead to a life- long friendship with him.
That first recording, was a gift given to me by the legendary Ustad. He allowed me to record him, because he wanted to help me. At that time Water Lily Acoustics did not even have a P.O. Box number! My musical tastes being quite wide, I began recording Western Classical musicians as well. I further, decided to record collaborations of musicians from different cultures. The first such recording I did, brought together two African American ladies, who were Gospel singers, whom, I paired with a Jali from West Africa by the name of Papa Susso, who sang and played the Kora. This recording was titled -A Gathering of Elders. Next, I recorded an Indian guitarist who played Hindustani music on a modified guitar with sympathetic strings, that he had developed. I recorded musician, Padma Bhushan V.M. Bhatt with the American guitarist Ry Cooder and the resulting recording, titled A Meeting by the River won a Grammy in 1994, stated Alexander.
More recordings followed with Padma Bhushan V.M. Bhatt being paired with other American virtuoso, such Bela Fleck (Banjo), Jerry Douglas, (Dobro), Blues singer Taj Mahal, Chinese virtuoso on the Erhu Jiebing Chen and the Palestinian virtuoso of the Oud Simon Shaheen.
I was the first to record Indian Classical musicians, both Hindustani and Carnatic, with other Asian musicians from China, Iran and the Arab world. Every recording that I produce is a labor of love, said Alexander.
Alexander maintains that his success does not go to his head. In fact he says that nothing comes entirely of our own.
Everything we know, come to us through the good will of others. A lot of people helped me in learning the art of recording. They were very willing and generous in sharing their knowledge with me freely. I cannot take full credit. My mother is the first person I should thank, since she prayed for me and set me on a spiritual path. She instilled the love of music in me, pointed out Alexander.
Recording is of course his passion. But he does not record in the traditional way as it is done in a studio with multiple microphones.
I use very simple microphone techniques that were developed in the 1930s. The technique I use has many advantages. It is a technique that lends itself perfectly, to the kind of music I am interested in recording. You cannot really record rock bands the way I do. That is something I know nothing about. What I do is more like documentary film making. I am basically capturing the reality of the unfolding of the music, in a suitable acoustic venue, with the highest audio fidelity.
The music I record has a reference, the real event. Whereas, in the multi- miked studio recording, one creates the reality in the studio. All I try to do is capture that magical moment, the unfolding of music, explained Alexander.
Alexander has learnt a lot by associating with the artistes.
They have basically gone through the fire. From that comes a certain level of wisdom and compassion. Khan Sahib saw the passion in me and helped me. From this initial gesture of kindness was born a deep friendship and bond and a father/son relationship grew. Men such as Khan Sahib have a vast knowledge of complex musical forms, with deep spiritual roots. Associating with these great masters gives you tremendous insights into yourself. That is something that I treasure. You think to yourself How can a human being possess this kind of skill and mastery, how can a human retain such vast amount of information, such as complex modes and rhythm cycles Humility is the first step to all learning, said Alexander

Nawaloka introduces minimally invasive Jetstream Atherectomy
Nawaloka Hospitals has revolutionised the treatment of peripheral vascular disease and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) by introducing Jetstream Atherectomy which is a minimal invasive technology involving a peripheral revascularisation platform designed to restore circulation to occluded vessels.
This technology is similar to the effects of conventional bypass surgery. Patients who undergo it can walk back home after the procedure, a spokesman for Nawaloka Hospitals said. The spokesman said deep vein thrombosis is a common problem, especially in the legs, and can be caused by anything which prevents blood from circulating.
Blood clots in the veins can break loose, travel through the blood stream, and lodge themselves in the lungs and become potentially life-threatening. Nawaloka Hospitals has set up a special unit for this process with the surgeons always available on call.
The Jetstream Atherectomy available at Nawaloka Hospitals, for the first time in Sri Lanka, is operated by personnel certified and trained in the system, the spokesman added.

Need to focus on new electoral system - Sunethra
Former Dehiwala-Mount Lavinia Mayoress Sunethra Ranasinghe yesterday stressed the need to focus on many issues in the new electoral system. We welcome this ward system, because there is a member to represent the people of the area  its not like in the past when they come to seek the vote and vanish until the next election.
She said that 60 per cent of candidates to a council is elected through the first-past-the-post system while the rest is elected through the proportional system.
The problem is this percentage 40-60 percentage. She lamented that her party won the council but her looser got bonus seats. There are bonus seats to be given to the losers. I won the electorate, but I didnt get any bonus. With the bonus they became equal to me. There are problems with this system. Attention has to be given to these things. Then whats the point of winning The peoples wish is not implemented at this time.

Pretty kitty: Real McCoy cat-alyst of purr-fect joy!
Following my last column on the track of the cat I have been constrained to write on the same subject this week as well. And its not because I am enamoured over the subject of felines but basically because the column elicited a great deal of reader response.
I am referring to the type of cat fanciers whose road to their hearts has been paved with feline paw prints. Whether you are an ardent cat lover like my long time boon buddies Delys and Dilu or detest these sophisticated fur-lined quadrupeds you must admit that they are among the smartest creatures on earth.
Both these delightful dames who are intimately acquainted with the domestic cat are among the most gentle, generous and genial souls one could ever encounter. No surprise then that the charming duo of cat-ladies constantly wonder why no effort has been made to develop the animals intellectual powers. There is no doubt, they contend, that the cat possesses a strong and subtle intellect and the capacity to use it for the benefit of mankind.
Their contention made me wonder too why yet this able creature is currently believed to waste its vast abilities in the frivolous pleasures of the chase, or in more questionable forms of dissipation. His obvious fondness for mice has been pointed out as a proof that low propensities may accompany luxurious habits. Additionally, his musical genius and romantic tendencies, which are so frequently displayed on the back fence, have actually been cited as evidence of his depraved and riotous activities.
Not so, say Delys and Dilu, who assert that no animal has been more thoroughly misunderstood by the careless and prejudiced observers who constitute the majority of mankind. They maintain vociferously and with perfect diction  they were both former celebrated broadcasters whose mellifluous voices radiated over our airwaves  that the cat is a creature of refined tastes, accustomed to wear neat and elegant fur and preferring to sleep on cushions rather than door-mats.
As a result, they argue, it has been constantly classed among useless and brainless dandies, or in the female equivalent, of dumb blonde mannequins sashaying the catwalk.
Then the cat is averse to all labour and delights in the luxuries that wealth commands. She loves to lie in the most costly chairs and on the softest pillows, and is never so happy as when she walks on plush carpets and is surrounded by lavish furniture. Love of luxury and elegance is the strongest passion of her nature.
She has all the instincts of a leader of fashion, and is the only animal that is thoroughly aristocratic in its tastes. The cat that has once been received into a palatial Colombo Seven mansion scorns the vulgar cats of Mariakade boarding-houses and associates only with her particular elite set.
As a cat owner youve probably found this out the hard way by now, but naming a fur baby can be just as hard as naming a baby human. Beyond the old favourites both my cat-loving buddies have christened their feral charges with unique monikers. Delys is totally smitten by her big tom Mishka, son of Mouser.
Mishka has lived a pampered life, along with his feline foundling brother Maputo, who unfortunately became a victim to a neighbours rat poison. Mishkas owner was heart-broken when he went missing for a week. Search parties eventually discovered the swashbuckling adventurer self-employed at a nearby gym keeping law and order over the rat population with his usual claw enforcement tactics. He returned sheepishly a week later after completing his mission.
Dilu in her way, provides a lifeline for several homeless felines who survive because of her loving care. Among her whiskered wards are Bumbo, a three-legged stray who loves cuddles. Others include Kalu and the unsociable Nirami who gits the heck out of the place after stuffing her face. Her all-time favourite, however, is the shy tabby, KittyCoy.
I mentioned in my column last week about the she cat who adopted us. Marmalade as she was christened, we called her Marmie for short, sported deep reddish orange splotches interspersed with black and white. She was the most colourful tabby we had ever encountered.
The problem was that she was also a promiscuous feline who paired frequently and often with different males that had fought each other to win mating rights. Her resulting kittens had obviously been sired by different males which accounted for littermates that looked surprisingly different from one another. One of her litters included an all male menagerie that included two orange kittens, another tiger-striped feline and a white one with black spots. We named the orange ones Ginger and Puma, the striped one Tiger and the spotted chap Caesar.
They were all given up for adoption except Caesar. But he was a skittish devil who was darned hard to pin down. Our houseman Siva had a time chasing it all over the place calling out its mistaken moniker Jesus ... Jesus in sheer desperation as the cat skittered away.
Ok so weve all heard about how cats love catnip found mostly in western climes. They drool, run around happily, and sometimes just space out with joy when they get their paws on the stuff. Its natures opium for felines on which they get on one heck of a high. But did you know there are other plants that might have the same effect on your cat here in Sri Lanka in your own backyard The effect of catnip only lasts about five to 15 minutes, so it might be good to have some other plants in your arsenal of cat opiates.
I am talking about the humble Kuppamenia plant (Indian Acalypha). Throughout the area where the plant grows, it is widely known for its effect on domestic cats, which react very strongly and favourably to the root of the plant. In this regard it is very similar to catnip, but the effect is much more pronounced on felines. Due to this ability it is called as Poonamayakki in Tamil.
A gentleman cat of my acquaintance was nicknamed Stoner the night he got a snootful of truly fine kuppamenia. He sat just a bubble off upright, eyes closed and swaying to music only he could hear.
Both mother cat Marmie and her offspring Caesar indulged in late night slaughter-thons of murdering mice and large rats and trotting back to drop their latest headless victims at our feet or doorstep. They then looked up at us expectantly as if to say: Come on, tuck in! It was their implication that we were too weak, inexperienced or stupid to catch our own prey.

Rajangane farmers request compensation
The Rajanganaya Reservoir Drinking Water Project is at a standstill due to several issues.
Five farmers who were injured during the recent clash between the Thambuttegama Police and Rajangane farmers had lodged complaints at the Human Rights Commission (HRC) against the Police, requesting compensation, Rajanganaya Joint Farmers Association Chairman Nihal Wanniarachchi said.
Wanniarachchi told the Daily News that the association had submitted a memorandum to President Maithripala Sirisena to intervene and stop the move to use the Rajanganaya reservoir as the water source to run the proposed China-funded drinking water project being implemented by the National Water Supply and Drainage Board.
The Rajanganaya reservoir caters to the cultivation of around 23,000 acres coming under the Rajangane colonisation schemea land area that 35,000 farmer families depend on to make ends-meet.
We protest against the proposal to pump water from the reservoir. The move would damage the tank and agricultural activities, he added.
We suggested to Irrigation Minister Duminda Dissanayake, that surplus water from the Neelabemma Irrigation Project could be used for the Rajanganaya Project.
Around 400,000 to 700,000 acre-feet of water is wasted from Rajanganaya tank annually which flows through the Neelabemma irrigation scheme to join the sea at Gange Wadiya in the area near the Wilpattu National Park, Wanniarachchi said.
He added that new reservoir could be built along the same lines of the ongoing Lower Malwathu Oya Reservoir Project.
There is a possibility to construct a new reservoir between Wilpattu and the Neelabemma scheme to acquire the required water for the proposed water project instead of using the Rajanganaya tank.

Reel restored
Cinema legend Sembuge Gamini Shelton Fonsekas birth anniversary was on March 21.
A significant number of Gaminis films and many more that were in the archives are decayed by now and not in a position to be restored as a result of non-preservation over the decades.
The Gamini Fonseka Foundation headed by Damith Fonseka initiated preserving, restoring and conserving Parasathu Mal as a pilot-project in 2016. Parasathu Mal produced by Chitra Balasooriya was directed by Gamini Fonseka himself in his youth.
This film restoration program has now been extended to preserving and restoring films kept at the NFC.
The closing ceremony of a five-day workshop on preserving, restoring and archiving films organized by the NFC in association with the international federation of film archives (FIAF), the film heritage foundation of India, Gamini Fonseka Foundation and Lester James Peiris Foundation was held at the NFCs Tharangani hall.
Three eminent persons were in Sri Lanka to share their practical knowledge on film restoration and conservation with the participants. They were Digital preservation Consultant, IWM Training and Outreach Coordinator FIAF, David Walsh, Former manager of conservation service at the National Film and Sound Archive of Australia (NFSA), Mick Newnham and Film Heritage Foundation Director, Shivendra Singh Dungarpur.
The first workshop was held at the NFC followed by two other workshops held for a selected group on March 12 and 13 at Dalugama Sarasavi studio. A discussion on film preservation was held on March 14.
The Sri Lankan government has invested 20 million rupees for the film preservation and restoration endeavour. FIAF has covered the visiting experts costs.
Present NFC Chairman Sithendra Senaratne mentioned the cinema great Dr Lester James Periess plea to scientifically restore Sinhala films in 1966. He appreciated Damith Fonsekas effort in restoring and preserving films that was extended from Gamini Fonseka films to other films kept at the NFC. He also appreciated the former NFC Chairman Deepal Chadraratnes efforts to restore and preserve local films with Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghes blessings. NFC Chairman commended the contribution by the visiting experts to conduct the workshops.
Damith Fonseka said, From time to time attention had been drawn towards archiving films without scientifically grasping the finer-points in the restoration and preservation processes. Thus films were kept in safe places for the sake of archiving them. Once films are converted to digital copies they are confine to a limited lifespan while films in reels could be kept in immaculate conditions for a 100 years. Hence the world is now sticking to basics as regards to film preservation and restoration using new technology.
Minister of Public Administration and Management and Law and Order Ranjith Madduma Bandara said that President Maithripala Sirisena and the Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe have made decisions on proactive contribution to rejuvenate local cinema.
The heritage of a country is of great importance to its people and to the world and the heritage of cinema of a country is no exception. Preserving our cinema heritage should not just be for the sake of nostalgia. The present Government has granted 25 million rupees last year to enhance facilities of Dalugama Sarasavi studio. We have granted 50 million rupees to commission a film preservation unit within the NFC. Also we have allocated 50 million rupees to commence a Film School in Dalugama Sarasavi studio premises. We will soon offer low-interest loans to digitalize film halls.

Ronnie OSullivan beats Shaun Murphy in final
Ronnie O'Sullivan beat Shaun Murphy in the Players Championship to claim a joint-record fifth title of the season.
The 42-year-old five-time world champion won Sunday's best-of-19 contest 10-4 in Llandudno.
After taking the lead at 2-1 O'Sullivan never looked back, despite fellow Englishman Murphy scoring the game's highest break of 137 as he briefly rallied to trail 7-4.
It is O'Sullivan's 33rd ranking title - three short of Stephen Hendry's record.
Victory for the world number two follows wins at the English Open, the Shanghai Masters, the UK Championship and the World Grand Prix.
Over the 1990-91 campaign, Hendry won five of the eight ranking events, a feat also matched last season by Mark Selby.
Murphy, the 2005 world champion, said it had been a "real honour to share the stage" with O'Sullivan.
"I predicted that if I didn't play at my very best I wouldn't win, and I was right," the 35-year-old said on ITV4.
"On behalf of all the players, I'd like to pay a tribute to Ronnie for the standard he is playing. While prolonging his career he's taking the game to new heights."
O'Sullivan said: "I played pretty decent, I'm pleased.
"I've just got to try and prolong my career as Shaun said. I can't play as much as the other guys because I would just be burned out. BBC

SAITM students need to study all options - GMOA
All solutions proposed for SAITM students should be given to them for their consideration without forcing them to select one (KDU) of the set of solutions, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said that the GMOA along with all the other parties presented a set of solutions, including KDU, for SAITM students, considering their different levels of qualifications. Now it is revealed that there are unqualified (who do not have minimum qualifications) students among SAITM students.
According to Dr. Aluthge, all qualified SAITM students should be given KDU MBBS and not an MBBS connected to the name of a closed-down illegal institution. They should be able to register themselves with the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). All SAITM students should be given one solution. Different solutions should not be given to sections of SAITM students.
The gazette notification in connection with closing down SAITM should be issued at the same time when the students enroll in KDU. SAITM should not be combined with KDU. The Cabinet paper should be based on the set of solutions given by all parties and it should not be distorted according to the requirements of the University Grants Commission (UGC) Chairman. Therefore amendments to the current Cabinet paper are essential. The concerned parties in the issue request an opportunity to meet the President to present more facts, he added.

Seminar on water management on April 5
Seminar on Water, quality, pollution, treatment and testing and workshop will be held on April 5 and 6 at Institute of Chemistry, Rajagiriya.
The event that would be addressed by professionals in the field will enable participants to gain the required knowledge and hands on experiences and guidance for efficient water testing and management.Water is an essential component of the living world. In many industries it is used as a medium for mixing ingredients, as a reactant or as a solvent to discharge soluble waste.
According to world Health Organization Report 2007, nearly 1.4 billion people worldwide are under the threat of not having access to good quality drinking water.
Proper handling of water in an industry or a laboratory is very important. The environmental problems with waste water can affect the industries critically.
Although, water is considered as a renewable resource, it may not be possible to have water with expected quality for the demand. Therefore, the proper water management strategies will be important to use the water efficiently. Quality assuring of drinking and industrially used water is of extreme importance.

Serve public devoid of political differences - President
Although parties contest elections as separate entities they should render a service to the public devoid of political differences after winning the elections, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President made this observation addressing SLFP members elected to Local Council elections in the Polonnaruwa district at their oath taking ceremony held under his patronage.
The ceremony took place at the Polonnaruwa Royal Primary College auditorium last morning.
The President said whoever acted with pride about the election victory the fact remains that even a single political party which contested the election could not obtain more than 40 percent of the valid votes.
If this happened to be a general election no party would have been able to form a government of its own according to available reports.
When you compared the votes received by the SLFP no other party would have been able to form a government without SLFP support, President Sirisena said.
As such no one should be either upset or overjoyed about the recent election result, the President said adding that based on this election result he would steer the SLFP forward as a victorious party in the future, the President said. He assured that as SLFP President he would make all necessary arrangements for this without any lapse. The President who emphasised that the newly elected members should act with discipline and humility to create a good and positive political culture advised them to perform their duties and responsibilities to the people properly. SLFP members elected to the Tamankaduwa UC and Tamankaduwa, Dimbulagala, Welikanda, Hingurakgoda, Lankapura, Medirigiriya and Elahera Pradeshiya Sabhas took their oaths before the President at the ceremony.
Copies of the biographies of Mahatma Gandhi and Nelson Mandela were also presented to the newly elected Local Government members by the President at this ceremony.
A large number of provincial politicians were also present at the ceremony.

A special award ceremony was organized by SLT, the national telecommunication service provider to reward the winners of the companys e-bill promotion which went underway recently, that allowed customers the facility of registering for e-bills online, through a self-registration portal.
The e-bill promotion was initiated to encourage more customers to switch over to the option of registering to receive e-bills as opposed to receiving the traditional paper bills through the post.
During the three months promotional period, a total of 50,000 customers registered for SLTs e-bill service. Out of these customers, the winners of the promotion include, H.M.S. Chandrika, D.N. Dandeniyaarachchige, D.M.S. Harshana Senawirathne, Rev. Viharadhipathy - Buddha Rashmi Temple, W.R.M. Wasana Wiramunda and P.R. Kulanga De Silva.

Smith quits as Royals captain after scandal
New Delhi:Indian Premier League side Rajasthan Royals on Monday replaced Australia's Steve Smith as captain over his role in a ball-tampering controversy.
Smith, who is on a $1.9-million contract with the Royals, will be replaced by India's Ajinkya Rahane as skipper for the IPL season starting next month.
"Steve believes given the current circumstances it's in the best interest of the Rajasthan Royals that he steps down as captain so the team can get ready for the start of the IPL without the ongoing distractions," the club said.
Australia captain Smith, 28, was banned for one Test and fined by the International Cricket Council after admitting that he and leading players planned ball tampering during the third Test against South Africa. AFP

Spice Girls planning animated superhero movie
The Spice Girls have reportedly signed up to star in their own animated superhero movie.
The iconic all-female group reunited in February to discuss future plans, fuelling fans' hopes that Victoria Beckham, Melanie Brown, Emma Bunton, Melanie Chisholm and Geri Horner would reform as a five-piece for the first time since a one-off performance at the London 2012 Olympics.
According to Variety, one project the band have in the pipeline is a new animated superhero movie, themed around their feminist "girl power" message.
"The Spice Girls are thinking big in terms of a franchise on a global scale," a source told the publication. "They're the most successful girl group on the planet. It's just what Marvel or Disney needs."
All five members have signed deals to allow their likenesses to be used in the film, with each voicing a heroic version of themselves with a unique "girl power" reflecting their personality and nicknames - Posh, Scary, Baby, Sporty and Ginger.
The insider added that all five are "fired up about the idea" and that they are currently looking for potential production partners. However, they added that talk of a tour may be "premature".
It is more than two decades since the group starred in their own live-action film, Spice World. They have also been animated before, in the video for their 1998 track Viva Forever.
Victoria has previously ruled out rejoining the band to perform together, and has told WWD.com that the group had no plans to return to touring or recording, but instead discussed how to bring girl power to a new generation of fans.
"We're just looking at how we pass on that message, as opposed to us going on tour or recording or doing a TV show," she said. "It's not about that. It's about us looking at the legacy and protecting it. And we all feel the same about that." Music NEWs

Stunned Australia digests ball-tampering shame
CAPE TOWN, Monday: A ban for captain Steve Smith in no way eased the fury directed at the leadership of the Australia cricket team as the sports-mad nation returned to work on Monday still digesting the ball-tampering scandal which broke in Cape Town over the weekend.
The story led the front pages of all of the countrys major newspapers, the headlines mostly working around the single word Shame, and on radio talk shows and social media the offenders were lambasted with a vehemence unusual for even those forums.
As this disreputable tour descended from the gutter into the sewer, the mythical line the Australians use as the yardstick for their behaviour has not only become blurred but disappeared altogether, Andrew Wu wrote in the Sydney Morning Herald.
The disconnect from what Steve Smiths men deem as acceptable behaviour compared to what the majority of the public back home has become as wide as the Indian Ocean which separates them.
There is no hyperbole involved when Australians describe the cricket captaincy as the countrys second most important job behind that of prime minister and the concept of playing hard, but fair has always been integral to the national identity.
For Smith, therefore, to have deliberately conspired to cheat by getting a junior member of his team to tamper with the ball during the third test against South Africa cuts to the very quick of the Australian psyche.
The players remained in their Cape Town hotel on Monday in preparation for the transfer to Johannesburg for Fridays fourth and final test, though for many their minds must surely be already on home. There were few smiles as they chatted quietly among themselves, some enjoying family time by the pool on what would have been the fifth day of the third test had South Africa not ripped through their batting on Sunday to inflict a crushing 322-run defeat and take a 2-1 lead in the series.
Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft were nowhere to be seen though, as Cricket Australias head of integrity Iain Roy arrived in South Africa to begin an investigation that will decide the international future of all three.
In the space of two days, top batsman Smith has gone from Australias cricketing golden boy to national pariah and it looks likely that he has played his last test as captain.
It has also cost him the captaincy of Indian Premier League side Rajasthan Royals, who announced on Monday he had agreed to step aside, to be replaced by Ajinkya Rahane.
Some of the most vehement reactions to the incident have come from his predecessors in the coveted baggy green cap, which each player is awarded on his test debut.
Steve Smiths time as Australias captain is surely up, former fast bowler and possible future Australia coach Jason Gillespie wrote for Guardian Australia.
It is impossible to envisage a scenario where he stays in the job. This is a train wreck.
This was pre-planned cheating. It may have been implemented by a junior player in Cameron Bancroft but it came with the backing and knowledge of the leadership group, a core of senior guys in the Australian set-up.
DISTANCING THEMSELVES
The identity of the leadership group that Smith admitted was responsible for Bancroft attempting to scuff up one side of the ball with a piece of tape was the subject of some conjecture, with Warner the only name definitely in the frame.
Several of the Australian correspondents in Cape Town report that some of the other supposed members of the group, pace bowlers Mitchell Starc and Josh Hazlewood, have moved swiftly to distance themselves from the incident.
Coach Darren Lehmann will also have questions to answer after clearly trying to cover up the incident once he realised the TV pictures had exposed Bancrofts cheating, even if Smith insisted the coach had not been part of the conspiracy.
Frankly, we believe that Steve Smith and Cameron Bancroft should have been on the first plane home yesterday, Australian Sports Commission chairman John Wylie told ABC Radio on Monday.
If an athlete had been representing Australia in an Olympic Games and they had brought the country and the team into disrepute, thats what would have happened to them.
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC), the sole authority on the laws of cricket since it was founded in 1787, called for better leadership across the global game.
The time has come for a major shift in attitude and culture of all those with responsibility for leadership within the game, to give young players the kind of role models who will uphold standards, preserve cricket and, vitally, the Spirit of Cricket for future generations, John Stephenson, MCC Assistant Secretary (Cricket), said in a statement.
Cricket Australia, coming off a highly damaging labour dispute last year, have also come under fire for the temerity of their initial response.  Agencies

Take good care of Colombo!
It is another remarkable achievement for Rosy Senanayake. She has been appointed as the Colombo Mayor. Many significant historical records have been made by Sri Lankan women in the past. This is another dimensional achievement.
The newly appointed mayoress has been given an important and prominent area which houses important places like the Supreme Court, residencies of President, Prime Minister, Ministers and most parliamentarians. The urbanity also houses Central Bank, Embassies and High Commissions, Port, Chamber of Commerce, Base Hospital, Five Star Hotels and Universities. Thus, it is her duty to make arrangements to keep the city clean and tidy.
The government has encountered numerous obstacles in solid waste management system over the last few days. The phenomenon has triggered miscellaneous issues such as dengue and other diseases. Colombo provides shelter to different types of people visiting on different types of business. It is vital that the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) ensures peace and sanity in keeping the daily business. The present position of the municipality is not so appreciable owing to the fact that it did not function under an elected authority.
Another major nuisance in the city is there is no place to walk for the pedestrians. The pedestrians are supposed to walk along the pavements reserved on either side of the road. But these pavements are occupied by various people for various purposes. Since the advertisements boards of several companies, the control box of the telecom and electricity boards occupied the major portion of the pavements the pedestrians have to undergo untold inconvenience when they use the pavements. Moreover, the Colombo city is a thickly populated city where more than 60,000 people are residing within the city limit.
Newly appointed mayor
Besides, there are thousands of tourists hanging around the city also facing various practical problems in fulfilling their daily needs. The city requires holistic solutions for the current issues from the newly appointed mayor. One-third of city dwellers are residing in slums and shanties. About two or three families live in a single house, creating various social problems in the city. To solve this housing issue, the mayor has already got a plan to build 50,000 houses in ten years. The newly elected mayor and the members are duty-bound to fulfil the pledges given to the people during the election campaigns.
Unlike the previous electoral system, the present ward system is more people-oriented. In the earlier system, members were elected by preferential votes. Now the preferential system is not in operation. This is ideal for a member to think about the number of voters who have cast their valuable votes to a single person to elect their member with the huge anticipation of obtaining maximum service.
The mayor can compare Colombo city with other cities in Singapore, Malaysia and Bangkok and take effective measures to upgrade the city and the suburbs of Colombo city. The most significant feature of Colombo city is all three communities live together in the city. It is the duty of the mayor and the members of the Colombo Municipality to create a conducive atmosphere where all communities live together without any discrimination or racial segregation.
Everyone should work hard to bring in ethnic harmony among communities that promote our economy and enhance our standard living. This is also high time for the municipality to adopt a proper mechanism for garbage disposal system in the city. There will be an impending danger in the garbage disposal because in few years the port city work will be completed. Tons of garbage will have to be disposed of.
Hence it is ideal now itself to seek proper solid waste management system in order to avoid inconvenience in the future.
Sanitary system issues
Another burning issue in the city is the sanitary system. So far the sanitary is randomly maintained to manage the emergency circumstances. The municipality should focus on the sanitary system of the Colombo city to provide a healthy life to the people. It is also pointed that the wetlands of Colombo are mostly on the verge of extinction. It is so important to maintain the wetlands to make the city beautiful and healthy. There are parks in the city that can be beautified by planting more trees and flowers. This will serve the purpose of respiration for a healthy life. It is highly important to build more public lavatories in the city.
There are general public and tourists seek for public lavatories in the city but they are frustrated with the poor facilities of the metropolitan city. There are open canals which spread bad odour and bacteria in certain areas of the city. That needs to be fixed immediately.
There are many maternity homes abundant without proper maintenance and people. Pregnant mothers suffer a lot without the service of the maternity homes around the city. The shanty dwellers are a major challenge. They are clueless about the basic hygiene. They are not willing to learn it either. Hence the municipality should educate these shanty dwellers about the hygienic and healthy life in order to make the city an ideal place for everyone to lead a healthy and happy life. Therefore, there is a great challenge waiting ahead for the mayor in administrating the Colombo Municipality.
That the present mayor is a versatile, innovative and capable person is beyond doubt. Let us keep our fingers crossed.

Take That hoping to turn stage musical into movie
Take That are in negotiations to turn their hit British musical into a major movie. Gary Barlow, Howard Donald, and Mark Owen are hoping to recreate the success of West End smash hit on the big screen - just like Abba stars Benny Andersson and Bjorn Ulvaeus did with Mamma Mia!
Barlow tells The Sun, "Its (film) definitely going to be made and could start shooting as early as next year. We dont know who will be the director as yet, but we're working on a deal now. Its really exciting but we appreciate theres a few hurdles to overcome first."
"Brad Pitt is playing me, obviously," he jokes, adding Mamma Mia! musical was the perfect example of a hit stageshow becoming a film.
"Mamma Mia! took the essence of what the theatre show was about and put it on the big screen," he explains. "And look at the success of La La Land and The Greatest Showman. Musical movies are really popular now."
Indeed, The Greatest Showman is still pulling in film fans three months after its Christmas release, while the soundtrack album has topped the U.K. charts for the past 10 weeks.
Meanwhile Take That have also announced their stage musical, The Band, will hit the Haymarket Theatre in London's West End for a theatrical run this Christmas.
Written by Tim Firth, the show features boy band Five To Five, who were discovered on TV talent show Let It Shine last year.
It kicked off a nationwide tour in September. Music News

UNP bags Tangalle UC, Aranayake PS chairs while Pohottuwa wins Dehiwela-Mt Lavinia
The UNP yesterday succeeded in turning the tables by winning the Mayoral positions of many Local Government bodies which were won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (Pohottuwa) at the last Local Government election.
UNP candidates were elected as head of Local Government institutions in Tangalle and Aranayake though the party lost the council at the last Local Government election.
Even though the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had won 14 wards in the Aranayake Pradeshiya Sabha at the recent Local Government elections, Nihal Seneviratne was elected as the Chairman during the secret voting held recently at a meeting presided by Sabaragamuwa Local Government Commissioner B.A.C.P.Bamunarachi at the Pradeshiya Sabha auditorium. Laksiri Aluthwatta of the UPFA was elected as Vice Chairman.
SLPP candidate for Chairman W.Jayaratne received 14 votes while the UNP candidate Nihal Senaratne received 16 votes and got elected. The SLPP proposed the name of Shantha Cyril Kumara for the Vice-Chairman position while the UNP proposed the name of UPFA candidate Laksiri Aluwatta.
Since both candidates received an equal number of votes in the open vote, the Commissioner had to draw lots to pick the Vice-Chairman and Laksiri Aluwatta carried the day by drawing the winning number.
Ravindu Wedaaracahhi representing the UNP was elected as the Chairman at the Tangalle Urban Council which the SLPP won at the LG elections. UNP candidate Mohommmed Riaz was appointed as the Vice-Chairman. The candidate of the SLPP, Wimal Hewa Dunuwila received the same votes as Ravindu Wedaarachi, but was unable to select the correct number from drawing lots securing the position of the Vice Chairman. The four candidates of the JVP and the UPFA abstained from voting when electing the Vice Chairman.
The UNP secured victory of the Dehiwala  Mount Lavinia Municipal Council with 36,935 votes and the SLPP managed to obtain 36,025 votes. Both the UNP and the SLPP secured 19 seats each for the council while the UPFA got 6 seats and the JVP acquired 4. The election of Mayor and the deputy was held yesterday morning, presided by the Commissioner of the Urban Council. Four UPFA members voted for the candidate of the SLPP while the rest voted for the UNP candidate. The members of the JVP abstained from voting.
Therefore, Stanley Dias was appointed as the mayor of the Dehiwala  Mount Lavinia municipal council. Keerthi Udawatte representing the UPFA was appointed as the Deputy Mayor with 25 votes while the UNP representative Sunethra Ranasighe got 19 votes.
Eventhough the UNP won the electorate during the LG elections, the party could not reserve the seat of the Mayor.

Venus outlasts Bertens to book Konta clash
MIAMI March 25: Three-time winner Venus Williams saved three match points in a three-set victory over Kiki Bertens on Sunday, lining up a fourth-round clash with reigning champion Johanna Konta at the Miami Open.
Williams, ranked eighth in the world, labored nearly three hours to beat 29th-ranked Bertens 5-7, 6-3, 7-5.
The 37-year-old American was cruising with a 5-0 lead in the opening set, but she squandered three set points as Bertens reeled off seven straight games to snatch it.
The second set was another streaky affair, but Williams gained a decisive break for a 5-3 lead and fought off a break point in the next game to force the decider. The seven-time Grand Slam champion would have to dig deep when she fell 1-4 down to her Dutch opponent in the third. AFP

Wagner bounces New Zealand to innings victory
Auckland, Monday: New Zealand pulled off a dramatic win by an innings and 49 runs over England in Auckland on Monday, wrapping up the rain-affected first Test with 18.5 overs to spare.
It is only the 10th time New Zealand have beaten England in the 102-Test history between the two countries.
As fortunes fluctuated on the final day in scenes reminiscent of the cliffhanger finish the last time the two sides met on Eden Park, five years ago, Ben Stokes lined himself up to be the hero England so desperately needed.
But with his dismissal for 66 on the stroke of dinner in the day-night Test, New Zealand went into the final session with the task of mopping up the last three wickets, while England still needed 69 runs to makes New Zealand bat again.
Five days after all seemed lost for England when they were rolled for a paltry 58 in their first innings, New Zealand settled the outcome with the tourists all out for 320. For three consecutive sessions in England's second innings, New Zealand changed the flow of the match with a wicket in the final over.
Joe Root went at stumps on day four to have England 132 for three, Moeen Ali fell at tea on day five after adding 36 runs with Stokes, and then Stokes went at dinner ending an 83-run stand with Chris Woakes.
Five years ago to the day England lost Ian Bell in the last over before tea to be seven down going into the last session, but then they had battling Matt Prior to save the day as they survived until stumps with one wicket remaining.
This time there would be no such heroics as Stokes, returning from exile after being dropped before the Ashes series following a nightclub altercation in England, saw his effort to snatch an unexpected draw end after 188 deliveries.
A stubborn stand for two sessions folded when he lost patience during a lengthy spell of short-pitched bowling from Neil Wagner -- New Zealand's go-to bowler when wickets are hard to come by -- and clipped a rising ball to Tim Southee at point.
Wagner, Todd Astle and Trent Boult all finished with three wickets.
When New Zealand declared their first innings at 427 for eight on Sunday, after almost two full days were lost because of rain, England faced a target of 369 to avoid an innings defeat.
They resumed the final day needing 237 and lost Dawid Malan early in the fifth over.
Stokes and Jonny Bairstow cautiously advanced the score to 181 in a partnership of 39 off 128 deliveries before Bairstow was out to another acrobatic catch by a flying Williamson for 26.
Ali was lbw to Boult with the umpire initially ruling in favour of the batsman before the decision was overturned on review.
Craig Overton could only manage three, Woakes went on to 52 before he fended a Wagner delivery to Henry Nicholls and the match ended when Astle had James Anderson caught at mid-off by Boult.
The second Test starts in Christchurch on Friday.

Wales great Adam Jones to retire from club rugby
Harlequins' former Wales front-row Adam Jones will finally hang up his boots at the end of the season to take up a full-time coaching role with the London club, the English Premiership side announced Sunday.
Jones, a four-time Six Nations winner, has been appointed as assistant forwards coach at The Stoop and and will work alongside forwards coach Graham Rowntree.
"I'll be officially retiring from playing at the end of the season," said the 37-year-old Jones in a Harlequins statement. "I've had a great career and never thought I'd go on to achieve what I have.
"I'm so passionately proud to have played so many times for Wales and was fortunate to be a part of three Grand Slam-winning teams. But its time to move onto the next chapter of my career and concentrate on coaching.
"We potentially have the best group of props in the Premiership at Harlequins, with England props Joe Marler, Kyle Sinckler and Will Collier, plus the up-and-coming Lewis Boyce. So I hope to be able to help them push on with Harlequins and at international level."
Jones's 18-year senior club career started with Welsh side Neath and encompassed spells with the Ospreys and a season with Cardiff Blues before joining Harlequins three years ago.
For Wales, he won 95 caps and also made five appearances for the Lions in an exactly 100-match international career that included the combined side's victorious 2013 tour of Australia. AFP

War years VIP bullet proof vehicles, LTTE ship dumped in the sea by Navy
Several bulletproof vehicles that were imported during the war for the security of Presidents and diplomats were dumped in the deep sea area off the western coast and destroyed last morning.
The eight vehicles were taken to the deep sea area with the aid of a Nnaval vessel, and dumped in the deep sea area, said Acting Navy Spokesman Lt.Com. K.K.C. Udayanga.
He told the Daily News that prior to sinking these luxury vehicles, the communication equipment and other valuable accessories were removed from these bullet proof vehicles.
These bulletproof vehicles cannot be auctioned and due their strength these cannot be crushed and destroyed either. Hence, it was decided to destroy them in this manner, he said.
It is believed that these vehicles were handed over to the Navy to be dumped at sea and destroyed.
Meanwhile, an LTTE owned ship was also sunk in this manner yesterday.
This ship which belonged to the LTTE fleet previously, was taken control of by the Navy in Malaysia and brought back to Colombo. After the end of the war this ship Weling was being used by the navy after it was renamed A522.
However due to years of use, the ship was in a dilapidated condition and although the Navy had auctioned it for scrap metal on several occasions, they had not received an acceptable bid to even cover the scrapping costs.
Therefore, it was decided to sink the ship in this manner, as is the practice worldwide, said the Acting Navy Spokesman.

The Shape of Water
Whimsical fairy tale with a fresh spin
From the horror of encountering a monstrous being to a blossoming romantic flick The Shape of Water can be best described as a fairytale for adults. Set against the backdrop of the Cold War era in America around 1962 the tale unfolds.
In the hidden high-security government laboratory where she works, lonely Elisa (Sally Hawkins) is trapped in a life of isolation. Elisa's life is changed forever when she and co-worker Zelda (Octavia Spencer) discover a secret classified experiment.
The lovers perspective
The Shape of Water is a Beauty and the Beast tale. It is the story about a woman who falls in love with a creature who ends up being kinder and more humane than most men. This suggests that inner beauty is more virtuous than external attractiveness. With one key difference the lovers perspective does not change. In most films, essential characters undergo a shifting of values. The way they see the world at the beginning of the movie is the opposite of how they see it at the end of it. This is true for the most Beauty and the Beast tales in which the lovers are initially repulsed by each other and eventually understand their surprisingly common interests.
However this is not so in the case of The Shape of Water. Eliza and the Amphibian Man (Doug Jones) are infatuated at first sight. Even before she meets the creature Eliza has a metaphysical connection with all things aquatic. The opening shots show her dreaming of living in an undersea kingdom. She takes long pleasurable baths. She repeatedly boils eggs in water, symbols of her own fertility that she later shares with her new lover. Her courtship with the creature proceeds linearly from there. They never fight or misinterpret each other. They just fall deeper and deeper in love.
Here, Elisa is the Princess without a voice. Director Guillermo del Toro had related that he wanted to create a new type of Beauty and the Beast in which the beauty is someone you can relate to. This means that she is not a perfect princess. The creature is the heartthrob of the movie. While, the apple pie image of a successful all American provider Michael Shannons Colonel Strickland is the cold war  era Gaston, who appears picture perfect but is a beast inside.
The key difference that separates this film from Beauty and the Beast is that the beast does not need to transform to find love. Del Toro had revealed this fact on Variety. The beast has to transform into a human to live happily ever after. The amphibious creature does not have to change. Eliza ends up entering his underwater world. This reminds us of the princess becoming an ogre at the end of Shrek.
Ultimately del Toro builds on his influences to embrace a result that is wholly original and perhaps weirder and more spectacular than anything we have seen before in the monster  a human romantic genre.
Transformation
The Shape of Water is still a story about transformation. The perspective that changes in this movie is our own represented by our supporting characters. Octavia Spencer as Zelda, Richard Jenkins as Giles and Michael Stuhlbarg as Hostetler (A.k.a) Dmitri bring about this idea.
Initially these people, just like us, view the creature as a monster - a source of mystery and danger. Over time their views soften and they recognize the beauty that Eliza saw from the get  go.
