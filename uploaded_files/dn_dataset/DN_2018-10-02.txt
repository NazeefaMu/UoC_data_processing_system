Female circumcision
We cannot act like passive victims
I would first like to say that even though there have been other opinion pieces written either anonymously or with pseudonyms that have appeared in the media that many people have mistakenly attributed to me, I do not want to take credit where it is not due. This is the only piece I have written on female circumcision so far.
I was 24 years old when I first heard that female circumcision was practised in Sri Lanka by my community, the Muslims. After my shock and horror at the news, I wondered why I had never known this before.
The answer is simple. In Islam, it is common knowledge that young boys and male infants are circumcised, similar to Jewish infants. When a Muslim boy is circumcised at the age of seven  though increasingly, many parents are opting to circumcise them at infancy  there would be a large celebration with parties lasting for a week. The seven-year-old boy would receive gifts and be the centre of attention during that time. But a Muslim baby girl or girl child is always circumcised in secret. That is why it took so long for me to discover that such a practice existed in my own community.
Often, even the parents of the child are not involved in the decision making concerning circumcision nor are they present in the room. A grandmother, mother-in-law or older family female member would be in charge of overseeing the procedure. An old woman who generally also shaved the babys hair would carry out the procedure. And I believe it is done on the 40th day after birth for infants. I am still in the dark about what exactly the procedure is. What is taken off, what is kept back, what instrument is used, how long it takes, where it is done, and so on. To tell you the truth, I still dont know. But doesnt the secrecy point to the dark truth And the reasons behind this shroud of secrecy are why I am against female circumcision.
I believe it is a womans right to control her body. This means that should any permanent change be performed on her physical person, it should be done with her consent. But what if, as the community tells us, circumcision is a religious obligation What if they tell you that you are not a Muslim if you are not circumcised Those are two frightening threats for a Muslim woman to face. She surely wouldnt want to condemn her daughters to that fate. If it is true that it is a religious obligation, then let us look at the reasons for that belief.
Female circumcision is not in the Holy Quran. Supporters of female circumcision relate hadiths or sayings of the Holy Prophet that support female circumcision. For those of you who are unfamiliar with the way hadiths came about, they were collected orally and written down some 200 years after the Holy Prophets death. Hadiths are divided into weak hadiths and strong hadiths and there is also a list of fabricated hadiths. There are three or four hadiths related to female circumcision  they are all weak hadiths. If it is obligatory in Islam, why is it that there are many Muslim countries that do not practice female circumcision And why are there non-Muslim African countries that practice it, as a tribal custom. Given the lack of documentation and knowledge regarding the subject, we have no idea when female circumcision came to Sri Lanka or what is done when it happens.
There is another reason for female circumcision being practised by the Muslims of Sri Lanka. Early on, as soon as I discovered this practice existed, I was told by my grand-aunt and older aunts that it was done to curb a womans sexuality. So that she would be satisfied by only her husband and not want too much sex and stray. It was apparent that female circumcision was a blatant attempt to control a womans sexuality.
Today however, the story seems to have changed. We are in an age of open access to information where equality is quickly becoming a universal byword and now the pro-circumcision lobby has awoken to a new public relations persona. It is no longer politically correct to say that female circumcision is done to curb a womans sexuality. Instead, the story has done a 180-degree turn. They now say it is healthier and sexually beneficial to a woman.
If indeed it is healthier, why, I wonder, are only Muslim women subject to the practice If it is healthier, I wonder why it is done in secret. If it does enhance sexual pleasure, why are Muslim women not even told they have been circumcised when they are ready to be given in marriage (I use the phrase given in marriage deliberately.) Isnt it ironic that for much of their life Muslim women are policed in every form, be it dress, behaviour or movement and brainwashed to be chaste virgins before marriage and yet be given an incongruous advantage at birth or a very young age that will make them sexual vixens once they get their first taste of sexual pleasure!
In addition, no one really knows whether sex is better after circumcision because there is no one to confirm this fact. Unless you know what sex is like before circumcision and then you know what sex is like after circumcision, you will never know the difference. And, if this is really so, I wonder why there arent hordes of women  instead of men  encouraging us all to be circumcised because the sex is just mind-blowingly good! What anyone can find out, instead, is that circumcised women feel more sensitive during sex, that because they dont have a protective covering over their clitoris, it might even be painful to have direct stimulation. Moreover, removal of the clitoral hood can cause permanent injury to the dorsal nerves of the clitoris. The World Health Organization classifies hoodectomy (which is what the public relations bureau of the pro-female circumcision lobby in Sri Lanka calls it to deflect criticism) as Female Genital Mutilation Type 1 A. The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists recommend that women seeking such types of surgeries be fully informed of the potential health risks of infection and pudendal nerve damage resulting in an over-sensitive or insensitive vulva, painful coitus, and of adhesions and scars.
A Sri Lankan infant or little girl of seven or eight cannot be fully informed of what is going to happen to her and its consequences. If all the reasons they cite are true, why is the pro-female circumcision lobby resistant to raising the age of performing these procedures to 18 and above It is very likely they resist because they know that once an 18-year-old girl starts reading up on religious literature and medical literature, she is not going to want to do it. So then, how different is this from child abuse
One might ask why Muslim women are suddenly vocal on this issue. Female circumcision is not an easy topic to talk about. Even if many Muslim women knew about it earlier, they would not have been keen to reveal it because there is, to be honest, an element of shame surrounding the topic. Something was done to us without our knowledge and we certainly dont feel comfortable talking about it. But if we dont, it will continue to be done to other little girls and baby girls and it will perpetuate a disgraceful practice. Secondly, I have personally heard criticism that this change towards prohibiting female circumcision can only come from within the Muslim community where women are traditionally silent. It is a criticism that applies to the reforms of the Muslim Marriage and Divorce Act as well.
So this is a direct plea to my Muslim sisters and brothers. Wake up! This deals with you. This change should come from us. We cannot act like passive victims. We cannot expect non-Muslim civil society to support us actively, even though, thankfully, they may very well support us in other ways. We cannot expect anything from our successive governments who are frightened of the possibility of losing votes and being charged with communal discrimination. We have to rely on ourselves.
Right thinking Muslim women and men need to get together and make ourselves heard. Stop listening to half-baked pundits and start learning about your own rights within Islam. History has proven that the extremists are convinced enough to make their twisted points of view regarding life, faith, politics, women, and numerous other topics, heard. But the moderates are silent. If we are silent, nothing will change. If nothing will change, we are condemning another generation of unwitting children to female circumcision. And if they are condemned, of what use are we

Cher is planning to send all her friends and relatives to Paris when she dies, so they can all party in the French capital.
The Mamma Mia! Here We Go Again star wants to go out with a bang and insists her wake will be a real knees-up in Europe, because she doesnt want anyone to sit around moping.
I want all my friends and family to go to Paris and have a big party, Cher told PrideSource. Im gonna fly everybody to Paris...
And shes not bothered about her legacy, insisting shes happy with the music she has recorded and the films she has shot.
Whats really great is theres music left behind and theres film left behind, you know she added. Im gonna leave a trail. Ill leave breadcrumbs.
Meanwhile, the 72-year-old pop superstar, who released her new album of Abba covers on September 28, recently ticked one thing off her bucket list when she puckered up to kiss Mamma Mia! co-star Meryl Streep at the films London premiere in July (18).
I said, Kiss me! And we just kissed! Cher recalled. We were just thinking it was stupid! It was so dumb! Meryl came behind me and I didnt know it, and then we turned to each other, she looked up at me and she said, You werent this tall yesterday! And we laughed. And we just kissed!
I had on my 10-inch heels, and you can see how tall I am next to her, and we just thought it was funny.
(Meryl is) wicked funny... She just will do anything for a lark.

American invincibles win third successive womens world basketball title
Tenerife, Sunday: The United States womens basketball team, who have not lost an international match for more than 12 years, swept to a third successive world title on Sunday with a 73-56 victory over Australia.
The six-time Olympic champions also took their winning streak to 51 matches.
In the match for third place, European champions Spain defeated Belgium 67-60.
The Americans, with coach Dawn Staley at the helm for the first time, have now won the world championship 10 times in 18 editions.
Sundays final was billed as a clash between two players both of whom tower over two metres -- Brittney Griner of the US (2.06m) and Australian star Liz Cambage (2.03m).
It was Griners night as Cambage, who had scored 33 points and grabbed 15 rebounds in the semi-final win against Spain on Saturday, saw her threat neutralised by the Americans impressive defence which allowed her only seven points.
A lot of people see that weve won a lot of games in a row now and gold medals but its not as easy as it looks, said 37-year-old US star Sue Bird.
We take a lot of pride in the way we play and a lot of credit goes to the other countries because if they continue to get better they will just continue to push us to get better and thats what its all about. AFP

Asia factory activity sputters as trade woes hit export orders
Factory activity in Asia weakened in September, with many trade-reliant economies seeing a slump in export orders in a sign that escalating US-China tensions are taking a toll on business confidence.
Rising raw material costs are also squeezing profit margins for Asian manufacturers, raising questions over future investment and reinforcing views that global economic growth is shifting into lower gear.
Business surveys released on Sunday and Monday pointed to deteriorating conditions across much of the region in September, with gauges of future activity offering little hope for a turnaround in the next few months.
Some of the immediate gloom will be dispelled by news that the United States and Canada had clinched a last-gasp deal on Sunday to salvage the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), removing one major near-term risk to the global outlook.
But that did little to ease concerns in Asia over further signs of cooling in Chinas economy and the risk of collateral damage for its neighbours as the trade war between Washington and Beijing grinds on.
Two manufacturing surveys from China on Sunday pointed to weakening in its vast manufacturing sector. A private poll showed factory growth stalled after 15 months of expansion, while an official gauge confirmed the sector was losing steam under the weight of shrinking export orders.
The first major readings on China for September suggest the worlds second-largest economy is continuing to lose momentum as domestic demand weakens and US tariffs bite, a combination that is likely to prompt Beijing to roll out more growth-support measures in coming months.
However, analysts dont expect additional stimulus to start stabilising Chinas economy until at least early next year.
Elsewhere in Asia, manufacturing also faltered in Vietnam, Taiwan and Indonesia last month, with Taiwans factories expanding at the slowest pace in more than two years on sluggish export orders, business surveys showed on Monday.
Major economies like Japan and South Korea saw headline activity readings hold up, but also suffered declines in export orders, suggesting that increasing protectionism and concerns of slowing Chinese demand were weighing on Asias biggest economies.
Global growth is now cooling, which we think is weighing on foreign demand for Chinese goods irrespective of tariffs, Capital Economics said in a note to clients.
India was among the few bright spots in Asia. Its factory activity expanded more quickly in September on strong domestic and export order growth, a welcome sign as policymakers worry about a sharp drop in the rupee and fallout from global trade frictions.
While rising trade protectionism is expected to deal the world economy a relatively modest blow this year, analysts expect risks will intensify in 2019 as tougher US tariffs kick in and global borrowing costs rise.
Countries that saw their currencies slump may be suffering from rising import costs. There are also signs Chinas slowdown and the trade friction are starting to hurt sentiment, said Koji Kobayashi, senior economist at Mizuho Research Institute.
It would take time for companies to relocate production from China to other countries. That means the initial impact of the trade friction on Asian economies would be negative.
The United States and China imposed fresh tariffs on each others goods last week, showing no signs of backing down from the increasingly bitter trade dispute that is expected to hit global economic growth.
Similar surveys are expected from Europe and North America later in the day. Preliminary flash surveys suggest euro zone business growth continued to ease in September, leaving the United States as the lone strong spot in the global economy.

Atlas Axillia Encouraging creativity in children for over 50 years
Fostering creative pursuits among children and teachers have been a passion close to the heart of Atlas Axillia; for over 60 years, the Company has been involved in developing a product range that meet changing student needs and aspirations.
Atlas products are designed and developed to connect and inspire senses from touch, look, smell and texture. Much effort is taken to understand consumer needs and create products that are a delight to own and use.
Todays students face challenges unseen by previous generations. They interact with technology and its advancements, often receive an information overload and have to manage their studies while facing many challenges in a highly competitive environment.
Over the world, experts believe that encouraging children to explore their creative skills can contribute towards holistic development. Engaging in creative pursuits such as art, hand work and related pursuits are said to empower children in empathic learning and development, enabling each one to become a star in his or her own right.
Encouraging and fostering creativity among students is not just a mechanism to help bring out the best in them but it is also an avenue that enhances the potential of each student, says Ramani Samarasundera of Atlas Axillia, Sri Lankas leading brand of stationary and manufactures of arts and craft equipment, Inspiring students to engage with creative pursuits empowers them to expand their potential and develop their wellbeing.
Having worked with teachers over the years, Atlas Axillia believe that creative activities such as colouring, creative writing and poems encourages children to develop fine motor skills and improve their hand and eye co-ordination. In addition, colouring helps children to focus and develop concentration while improving colour recognition. It also enables them to develop a sense of achievement which can improve their personality development.
Imaginative activities such as colouring, handwork stimulates creativity in children adds an educational expert,  Such creativity also encourages their spatial awareness, helping them to express themselves better and improve their structural skills. Colouring has the power to enable children to connect with their environment, helping them to see their world in colour.
 The Atlas Axillia team connects constantly with child centered developments ;we try to gain insights into how student needs change with time and with age  throughout our history as a company, we have strived to deliver the best possible products that encourage and empower student communities in Sri Lanka says Asitha Samaraweera, CEO of Atlas Axillia in conclusion.

Bank of Ceylon commemorates World Elders Day, Childrens Day
Commemorating the World elders and Childrens Day on October 1, 2018, the Bank of Ceylon sends a reminder about the importance of securing the financial future of both to ensure a respectable, blissful life ahead.

The depositor becomes eligible for an insurance cover to a maximum of Rs. 1 million if he/she maintains multiple Ran Kekulu accounts depending on the account balance. Furthermore, 2,000 scholarships worth Rs. 15,000/- each are granted annually to Ran Kekulu account holders that emerge successful at the grade 5 scholarship examination. A minimum balance of Rs. 5,000/- maintained in a Ran Kekulu account qualifies the account holder for most of the privileges mentioned here.

In the case of no installment being made to the account either consecutively and/or intermittently the Bank will give a concession/grace period up to a maximum of 6 months or if it exceeds the grace period the outstanding will be transferred to a Ran Kekulu account under the name of the child.

A tweet from the shows account announcing Beyonce as the winner praised the Single Ladies hitmaker for her charity work with her BeyGOOD Foundation and gushed that she had changed the landscape of pop music with songs infused with political meaning like those on her 2016 album Lemonade. It is not the first time Beyonce has been honoured on the radio show, as in 2016 she was named as one of the seven most powerful women of the past 70 years.
Taylor was praised for helping to empower young girls - and for standing her ground and winning a legal battle with a U.S. radio DJ she accused of sexual assault.
The trio were the only popstars to make it into the top ten, with U.K. Performing Right Society for Music boss Vanessa Reed sandwiched between Taylor and Adele at three. Vanessa wrote on Twitter that she was honoured and humbled to be chosen just behind Taylor and Beyonce.
Lower down the list were Cardi B, in 14, SIA, at 15, Wolf Alices Ellie Rowsell at 16, and Dua Lipa - who just made the top 20.
Womans Hour producers released the music power list to coincide with BBC Music Day.
To mark the occasion Kylie Minogue recorded station announcements for British rail commuters, while Pulps Jarvis Cocker and Candida Doyle also competed against the Happy Mondays Bez and Rowetta in a special edition of U.K. TV antiques selling contest Bargain Hunt.

BJP slams DMK on Sri Lankan issue
The Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam and the All India Anna Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam have contributed very little to the States development, Union Minister Pon Radhakrishnan said on Sunday.
Addressing a public meeting to highlight the four- year achievements of the Bharatiya Janata Party-led Central Government, he said the two political parties had only divided people on caste and religious lines.
The DMK that usually highlighted the Tamil cause was guilty of betraying the Tamils in Sri Lanka by being a part of the UPA government at the Centre, which helped the Sri Lankan government.
DMK president M. Karunanidhi had also staged a fast and then ended it saying the war had ended. Trusting his words, many Tamils in Sri Lanka who came out were killed, . Radhakrishnan said, and wanted to know what was the present DMK presidents response to what the former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said in this regard.
The Minister said the Central Government under Prime Minister Narendra Modi was concerned about the States development and that was why the Centres allocation to the State in the past four years at Rs. 98,914 crore was higher than the UPA Governments allocation of Rs. 56,971 crore during 2009-14.
Highlighting allocations made under various schemes and the number of beneficiaries under each scheme, Radhakrishnan said the State had benefited much more under the Modi-led government than any other.
The then DMK president M. Karunanidhi had also staged a fast and then ended it saying the war had ended. Trusting his words, many Tamils in Sri Lanka who came out were killed, Radhakrishnan said, and wanted to know what was the present DMK presidents response to what the former Sri Lankan President Mahinda Rajapaksa had said in this regard.

CID to probe 20-year-old Korean cold case
The CID has commenced investigations into a gang rape incident that had taken place in Korea 20 years ago. In 1998, an 18-year-old Korean girl had died in a traffic accident on the Guma expressway in the Thegu area in the Korean Republic.
The Korean Police and other investigators had found the girl's underwear in another location from where she had been killed in an accident. The authorities having found sperm on her clothes had conducted DNA tests on the sperm samples but they were unable to match the DNA to anyone at the time. Subsequently, the authorities had safely stored the DNA samples.
Meanwhile, 12 years later in 2010, another Sri Lankan who had gone to Korea on employment was found guilty by the Thegu Court for inviting an under aged girl for sex for money. Generally, in Korea they obtain DNA samples of offenders and store them and compare them with DNA samples of unidentified cases. In this case the Korean authorities had compared the DNA of the convicted suspect with the DNA that was found on the undergarments of the accident victim in 1998. In 2011 the Korean authorities revealed that the DNA of the convicted Sri Lankan matched the stored samples from the accident victims clothes.
The accident victims father had constantly been pressuring the Korean authorities to press charges against the Sri Lankan man but according to Korean law, rape charges could not be filed after 10 years of the incident. Accordingly, the Thegu Courts rejected the case. Two other Sri Lankans who were allegedly involved in this gang rape of the accident victim had by this time, returned to Sri Lanka.
The Korean authorities had notified the Sri Lankan government through diplomatic channels about this incident on August 28, 2017 and on may 30, 2018, a Korean team arrived in the country and met with the Attorney General, CID and Justice Ministry Officials.
The Attorney General had issued instructions to the CID to conduct investigations in this regard and a team of CID officers had gone to Korea for this purpose. The CID team had recorded statements at the Sri Lankan Embassy in Korea and had subsequently visited the site of the incident.
"The CID had established that all three suspects involved in this gang rape are in Sri Lanka and they had presented information to the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court yesterday(October 1). This is the first time that the law is being enacted according to the provisions of Sri Lanka," Police Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.

Kudos to Health Minister
I greatly appreciate Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratnas instructions to the Ministry Secretary to suspend the salaries of medical staff who did not report to their service stations on transfers.
All underdeveloped hospitals in rural areas are running short of doctors and other medical staff. Most of our poor sick people are suffering due to lack of adequate health staff.
Some of doctors and medical staff in developed areas get used to earn more and more money after their usual work in government service. Therefore ministers action is reasonable.

Climate change funds available to businesses
There are many international funding sources that businesses can tap to build resilience to the impacts of climate change but which are not adequately made use of, according to Attorney-at-Law Lalanath de Silva, a public interest litigator in the area of environment.
The impacts of climate change are already being felt with regular cycles of floods and drought that are increasing in frequency and intensity, he said.
The highest losses will be from floods, followed by cyclones and high winds, drought and landslides, according to World Bank studies. The 2016 floods and landslides caused damage that was more than twice that of the worst floods between 1992 and 2011.
It is of utmost importance for Sri Lanka to build physical and financial resilience to deal with the impact of disasters, De Silva told the CEO Forum of the Biodiversity Sri Lanka (BSL) on Climate Change Challenges and Solutions for Sri Lankan Businesses recently.
BSL is a private sector-led, member-driven platform which aims to encourage increased involvement of the corporate sector in biodiversity and environmental conservation and was initiated by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) and Dilmah Conservation.
We as an island are more vulnerable to climate change than others, De Silva said. We need to prioritize and concentrate on climate change adaptation and get funds that are becoming available to nations and businesses. We need to mobilize financial support from all quarters, he said. There are many multilateral agencies which provide funds. Multilateral development banks have climate finance available to businesses in developing countries. Sri Lanka is not doing enough to tap into these funds.
Funds were available for the private sector under the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, the Green Climate Fund (GCF), Climate Investment Funds and the CDM facility.
Most businesses dont know about them, De Silva said.
The Green Climate Fund, headquartered in South Korea, where De Silva works, invests in low-emission and climate-resilient development to help vulnerable societies adapt to the impacts of climate change. It has raised $10 billion to invest in developing countries which need to adapt to climate change.
It gives mostly grants to developing country governments and also very low cost loans and equity investments, he said.
The $8 billion Climate Investment Funds (CIF), supported by the World Bank, provides low-cost, long-term funds for clean technology, energy access, climate resilience, and sustainable forests in developing and middle income countries.
The Netherlands CDM (Clean Development Mechanism) Facility was set up to purchase greenhouse gas emission reduction credits. It supports projects in developing countries that generate potential credits under the CDM established by the Kyoto Protocol to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change. These include renewable energy technology, such as wind, solar, and small-scale hydro-power, clean, sustainably grown biomass, energy efficiency improvement, and fossil fuel switch and methane recovery and carbon sequestration.

Asia Cup 2018 memories:
Cricket was the ultimate winner
Asia Cup 2018 turned out to be the most exciting and entertaining Asia Cup of all time. There was individual brilliance, team disappointments, and close encounters. At the end of 13 matches, it was India who became the champions and worthy winners. But in the end, it was the game of cricket which was the ultimate winner in this Asia Cup.
In this article, an attempt is made to present the readers with the entire highlights and memories of Asia Cup 2018 in a condensed form.
THE MALINGA BURST
The Asia Cup 2018 started with a bang when the old warhorse Lasith Malinga cleaned up Liton Das and Shakib Al Hasan in the very first over of the competition. It was sad to note that both Malinga and his team faded away thereafter.
THE TAMIM INJURY AND RAHIM HEROICS
It was a pity that Tamim Iqbals Asia Cup got over in just the 4th over owing to injury. The opening match of the Asia Cup 2018 between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh will be remembered for Mushifi1ur Rahims century and Tamim Iqbals bravery.
EASY GOING FOR PAKISTAN
Pakistan started their Asia Cup campaign with a comfortable 8 wicket win over Hong Kong.
SRI LANKA KNOCKED OUT
The Sri Lankan campaign lasted just 3 days. Afghanistan made their presence felt for the first time in this Asia Cup by knocking title contenders Sri Lanka out of the Asia Cup. It was the beginning of Afghanistans giant-killing act.
THE HONG KONG SCARE FOR INDIA
The Indians thought their first match against Hong Kong would be a practice for the big match against Pakistan. It was expected to be a walk in the park for the Indians. But the Hong Kong openers had other ideas as they put on 174 runs for the first wicket. A little bit of experience in the Hong Kong middle order could have given the Indians the shock of their life. In the end, Team India had a narrow escape.
LACKLUSTER INDIA-PAKISTAN ENCOUNTER
There was a lot of hype before the group match between India and Pakistan. But the performance of the Pakistani batsmen did not live up to the expectations. Pakistan were bundled out for 164 and India won the match quite convincingly by 8 wickets. The only negative for India in this match was the injury to Hardik Pandya but it resulted in the welcome return of Ravindra Jadeja into the one day team.
THE EMERGENCE OF RASHID KHAN, THE ALL-ROUNDER
We all knew the Afghanistan star Rashid Khan could swing his bat around. But in the match against Bangladesh, Rashid scored a fifty when his team was in deep trouble. Rashid Khan followed that up with a bowling spell of 9-3-13-2 as Afghanistan successfully completed their second giant-killing act. At that time, everyone thought Afghanistan were through and it was the end of the road for Bangladesh. How horribly wrong we were.
THE RETURN OF JADDU
The first super four match between India and Bangladesh witnessed the return of Ravindra Jadeja to white ball cricket. Jadeja made an immediate impact on his return by claiming 4 wickets. As far as the match was concerned, it was another one-sided affair. India, on the back of an innings of 83 not out from Captain Rohit Sharma, won the match quite easily.
HEARTBREAK FOR AFGHANISTAN
It was smooth sailing for Afghanistan in the group stages of Asia Cup. They crushed Sri Lanka by 91 runs and Bangladesh by 136 runs.
With their improved performances in the group stages, in their super four matches against Pakistan, Afghanistan were expected to give them a run for their money. While Afghanistan ended up running Pakistan close, it was the presence of the experienced Shoaib Malik in the middle which saved the day for the Men in Green. For Afghanistan, it was heartbreak having lost the match in the last over.
INDIAN OPENERS MAKE MERRY
When Pakistan put 237 runs on the board against India in the super four match, everyone thought that with the kind of bowling resources at their disposal, they could run India close. But both the Indian openers Rohit Sharma and Dhawan decided to simultaneously showcase their talent in the same innings. Both Rohit and Dhawan scored hundreds to make a mockery of the chase. The only wicket that fell for India in the innings was through a run-out. Such was Indias domination.
HEARTBREAK FOR AFGHANISTAN AGAIN
The super four match between Bangladesh and Afghanistan was a must-win for both the teams. Both the teams wanted to win the toss and bat first.
But at that crucial juncture, Afghanistan ran out of luck. Bangladesh batted first and were in trouble at 87 for 5. At that stage, Afghanistan let the game slip and Rashid Khan was ineffective for the first time in the tournament.
Bangladesh managed to recover to 249 for 7 through contributions from Mahmudullah (74) and Imrul Kayes (72). A target of 250 was a tall order for Afghanistan but they fought valiantly only to lose by 3 runs. Mustafizur Rahman defended 8 runs in the last over. Afghanistan had their second heartbreak in 2 days.
THE TIE
The super four match between India and Afghanistan will be remembered for so many things. India had already qualified for the finals and Afghanistan were out of the tournament. India experimented with their team composition by making 5 changes.
This had narrowed the gap between the two teams.
Dhoni was captaining India for the 200th time. This match will be remembered for the astonishing innings of 124 by Mohammad Shahzad. He took the inexperienced Indian bowling attack apart by hitting 11 fours and 7 sixes. Afghanistan set India a target of 253 to win. In the end, that target proved to be exactly enough to tie the match.
It was a strange coincidence that both Dhonis first (T20) match as captain and last match as captain ended in a tie.
For Afghanistan, it was a fitting end to the tournament in which they had comprehensively beaten Sri Lanka and Bangladesh and came so close to beating both India and Pakistan.
THE VIRTUAL SEMI-FINAL
The last super four match between Pakistan and Bangladesh was a virtual semi-final. The winners of that match would meet India in the final. Junaid Khan and Shaheen Afridi reduced Bangladesh to 12 for 3 before Bangladesh recovered through Mushifiqur Rahim (99) and Mohammad Mithun (60) to reach 239. A target of 240 proved too much for Pakistan as they crashed out for 202.
THE GRAND FINALE
Bangladesh reached the final unexpectedly. With a bit of luck, it could have been Afghanistan. Bangladesh made use of that opportunity when their openers put on 121 runs for the first wicket. But thereafter, it was India all the way as they restricted Bangladesh to 222.
Bangladesh showed a lot of fight in defending the modest target. India huffed and puffed to reach the target. In the end, it was left to the limping Kedar Jadhav to come to Indias rescue by scoring the winning runs off the last ball of the tournament.
The Asia Cup 2018 which started with an injury to Tamim Iqbal ended with the injured Kedar Jadhav scoring the winning runs for India. In the end, cricket was the winner in Asia Cup 2018.

Crime solving rate highest in North
The Northern Province has the highest rate of crime resolving in comparison to the rest of the country, Northern Province Senior DIG Roshan Fernando said.
He said last year the crime resolving rate in the Northern Province was 82%, while this year so far 77% of the crimes in the North have been resolved.
Police in the Northern Province arrested 56 suspects in relation to gang violence in the Northern Province this year and produced before court. Of them, 42 had been released on bail while 14 of those arrested are still in custody, he said.
This was said in response to a query made by the Daily News about the gang violence being reported in the North and the recent claim by the Commander Northern Security Forces Headquarters that if given the opportunity, the army would be able to put an end to the criminal gang known as Aava Group which is operating in Jaffna, within two days.
This statement has been interpreted by some as the inability of the police to control these gangs.
However, refuting these allegations, the Jaffna Senior DIG said there are 53 police stations in the North and of them, the gang violence is being reported in only four police areas. They are in Jaffna, Kopai, Chunnakam and Manipai Police divisions.
Senior DIG Fernando assured that there have not been any murders committed by the Awa gang members and most of these clashes are between the members of the Awa gang and the Dhanu Rock faction that had left the Awa gang and formed their own gang.
Denying reports that these gangs were terrorising the residents of the North, the Senior DIG said that these attacks are mostly retaliatory attacks between these two gang members.
We are continuing these operations to control gang violence in the North while engaging in other normal duties as well. These are not big incidents, but they would not be ignored and will be dealt with. There are far more serious incidents being reported from other areas of the country in comparison to the incidents in the North, he added. According to the Senior DIG, even the recent robbery, which is considered the biggest robbery in the North to date, has been resolved and those responsible have been taken into custody. Those involved in the robbery at a finance company in Chavakachcheri were arrested.
The investigations were carried out immediately and it was revealed that the cashier of the same finance company had planned this robbery together with several others, he said, adding that measures are also being taken to curb the drug operations in the North. However, he noted that there was no need to be alarmed about these incidents as these issues have been brought under control by the Police assuring that there is no threat to civilians or visitors in the North.

A new building for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Centre for Education and Research (CSL-CER) was inaugurated at the University of Ruhuna (UOR) with the aim of strengthening marine science and research in the country, the UOR said in a statement on Saturday.
The CSL-CER is handled by the UOR and the South China Sea Institute of Oceanology of the Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)an outcome of a national-level cooperation agreement signed in 2014.
It is also the CAS' first overseas research centre on marine sciences.
According to the statement, the CAS had granted opportunities to more than 20 Sri Lankan students to pursue their PhD/Master's degrees on marine sciences in CAS research institutes during the past three years. The CAS, along with the UOR and other Sri Lankan agencies, will push the centre to play a bigger role in international cooperation on marine sciences and education in the Indian Ocean region.
Chinese Academy of Sciences Vice President Hou Jianguo said the CAS would continue to promote comprehensive cooperation for science and education using the newly-launched ocean observation platform.
UOR Acting Vice Chancellor Nayana Alagiyawanna said the joint observation system of the tropical marine environment set up by the CAS and the UOR a few years ago had put the UOR on in important position in the field of marine research in Sri Lanka.

## Title: Is a Currency Board solution to depreciating rupee
## Supertitle:

Is a Currency Board solution to depreciating rupee
Sri Lankas rupee depreciated rapidly over the last month. The Government has claimed the problem is mainly due to global pressures and has reacted with a series of import restrictions on vehicles, consumer durables and perfumes. Bankers report that similar controls were imposed in 2009 during another episode of devaluation.
Currency instability has been a recurring phenomenon in Sri Lanka.Money is the medium of exchange, and a sound, widely accepted currency promotes trade. Trade was vital to ancient Rome which introduced a uniform currency throughout their empire. Historically, the use of money arose due to the inconveniences of barter. Money serves three fundamental purposes:
1. It is the medium of exchange: Money is used for trading goods and services. In the absence of money trade could only take place through the cumbersome process of barter.
2. Unit of account: Money is the common standard for measuring relative worth of goods and services.
3. Store of value: It is the means by which wealth is stored. Without money people would need to store their wealth as goods, which is cumbersome and expensive.
Money oils the wheels of trade; it is obvious that it performs its functions best when its value is stable. If the value of money fluctuates widely it undermines its fundamental purpose. A simplistic example drives this point home.
Imagine being contacted by a broker about a 2,500-square-foot house, only to visit and find a house half the size. The prospective buyer would have very little trust in the broker. This is purely hypothetical given that a foot is a foot. Since its definition is unchanging, 2,500 square feet means the same today as it did 20 years ago.
Whatever the level of trust buyers have in their brokers, square footage will never be a factor; that is, unless the length of the foot is allowed to float, and its length declines. Suddenly, 2,500 square feet could very well mean 1,500 square feet in real terms, and trust in brokers will plummet.
This illustrates the effect of an unstable currency. Sound money has underpinned the growth of Singapore and Hong Kong. What lessons do these hold for Sri Lanka
Hong Kong has a Currency Board, which means all currency issued in the territory must be at least 100 per cent backed by foreign reserves. Singapores monetary policy, although no longer a fixed board (which it once was) retains the key characteristics of a currency board. A currency board is similar to a fully backed gold standard.
As the currency is fully backed by hard reserves it is freely convertible and immune from depreciation. The exchange rate can remain fixed but in practice many countries that run currency board arrangements allow a small fluctuation in the exchange rate to reflect trading conditions. The exchange rate may also be revised periodically, to ensure it remains consistent with the underlying fundamentals of the economy; which is what Singapore does.
The currency board guarantees the convertibility between the local currency and foreign currency at the foreign exchange rate in the currency board system. The local currency is linked with the foreign currency by the guarantee of convertibility and the fixed exchange rate. Therefore, the confidence in the local currency is linked with that in the foreign currency by the currency board arrangement, and the local currency acquires the properties of the foreign currency with respect to the basic functions of the money.
The Currency Board cannot create money, except when actual reserves are available nor can it lend money to the Government, usually described as printing money (or, euphemistically, quantitative easing).
Since the Government cannot borrow from the Central Bank (a source of easy money) it must rely on taxes or debt to finance spending, which imposes a degree of fiscal discipline. This in turn results in low inflation. As the money supply also changes only with movements in reserves, interest rates remain fairly stable and are generally low.
Currency board systems assure convertibility, instil macroeconomic discipline limiting budget deficits and inflation, provide a mechanism that guarantees adjustment of balance-of-payments deficits, and thus create confidence in the countrys monetary system,
In other words; the perfect way to impose discipline when grappling with difficult financial problems.
For this reason Currency Boards were adopted in several East European countries when transitioning from Communism. The transition from communism caused severe monetary shocks in Eastern Europe. To manage the transition several countries including Estonia, Lithuania and Bulgaria implemented currency boards with great success; inflation declined and economic growth picked up.
IMF studies show that historically, countries with currency board arrangements have experienced lower inflation and higher growth than those with other regimes. The lower level of inflation is explained partly by the greater monetary discipline imposed but also by the greater level of confidence engendered by adopting the Board.
Note that a Board is not a simple exchange rate peg (which is what Sri Lanka had pre-1977) the requirement for the currency to be fully backed by reserves, the restriction on lending to the state and a long-term commitment to the system usually enshrined in law are crucial differences that underwrite the stability of the currency.
To date no currency board has had to be abandoned as a result of a crisis. The Asian currency crises of 1997 provided a severe test: all currencies of SE Asia depreciated rapidly except those of Hong Kong and Singapore. The worst affected was the Indonesian rupiah which dropped from $1=Rp2,400 to $1=Rp14,500, the Thai Bhat fell more than 50% and the currencies of South Korea, the Philippines and Malaysia were all battered.
Alone amongst its neighbours, the Hong Kong Dollar was unaffected, despite repeated speculative attacks. Although Singapore allowed its currency to depreciate by around 20%, to adjust to the relative weakness of its trading partners during the crisis, it was a matter of choice by policy makers rather than an event forced on them by circumstances.
Currency boards were once the norm. Invented by the British they provided the stability that allowed foreign trade to flourish throughout the Empire. With the decline of the Empire the boards were gradually dismantled by the newly independent states, except in a few places such as Singapore and Hong Kong.
Adopting a Currency Board would address Sri Lanka chronic currency problems and provide the platform for long term growth.

These are 1) Zero Carbon  A 15,000 sq. ft. solar roof generates all the power the complex needs. 2) Local & Sustainable Food is the concept of an urban vertical farm which produces chemical fertilizer-free, pesticide-free, weedicide free fruits and vegetables within the building. 3) Sustainable Transport is car-pooling using freely available emission-free electric vehicles charged with solar renewable energy. 4) Culture & Local Community  involves recruiting a pool of caregivers and drivers to replace the cultural norm of servants. 5) Equity & Local Economy is the availability of meeting rooms and a conference hall. 6) Zero Waste  Waste will be recycled, composted and used in the vertical gardens and farm with excess sold as organic fertilizer. 7) Health & Happiness  Organic food 8) Sustainable Water  Harvested rain water and recycled water is used for the vertical gardens and farm. 9) Sustainable Materials  Alternative aggregates to river sand make the walls soundproof, heat and fire retardant and reduces the carbon emissions of the building further. 10) Land use & Wildlife  The vertical gardens around the building will help protect and enhance the natural habitats for birds, bees, micro wildlife and butterflies, making sure the ecological balance is not disturbed.

TRIBUTEMahatma Gandhi
He inspired the world
A Celebrated icon on postage stamps, Mahatma Gandhi is someone nations world over turn to for inspiration.
Mahatma Gandhis steadfast belief in, and practice of, non-violence and peace has been a source of inspiration around the world. He is of course the father of the Indian nation, but his is a global iconic status.
Countries around the world have turned to the great apostle of ahimsa (non-violence), whether they were fighting for freedom from colonialism or seeking to establish human rights and peace. The United Nations has also declared his birthday, October 2, as the International Day of Non-Violence. Gandhi has been honoured by countries around the world on their stamps depicting diverse aspects of his life, work and philosophy, making him perhaps the personality most featured globally on postal stationery.
The first set of stamps on Mahatma Gandhi was introduced in India in 1948. Anil Dhir, in his book Famous StampsThe Romance of Raritieswrites about the stamp issue right from the concept; in 1947, of having a set of stamps on Gandhi to be released to commemorate his 80th birthday which would have fallen on October 2, 1949. However, the great leader was assassinated on January 30, 1948, and the set of stamps was released on August 15, 1948, marking Indias first anniversary of Independence.
The stamps were printed in Switzerland rather than India. Some of the stamps were then Service overprinted back in India for Indian Governor-General C. Rajagopalacharis official correspondence. Then, in 1969, the birth centenary of Gandhi was commemorated in India by issuing four stamps. Gandhi and his wife Kasturba, affectionately addressed as Bapu and Ba, were shown on the Ba-Bapu stamp.
South Africa was crucial to Gandhis satyagraha (insistence on truth), and in 1995, a joint stamp issue of India and South Africa was released. The stamps show the young lawyer Mohandas Karamchand Gandhi and the elderly Mahatma. The illustrations on the miniature sheet show Gandhi spinning the charkha and at Dandi, as also his belongings such as a timepiece, spectacles, and slippers that portray his frugality and simplicity. The Centenary of Satyagraha also saw the India Post introducing four stamps in 2007 depicting events from Gandhis life in South Africa.
As the leading light of the freedom struggle in India, Gandhi served as the Indian National Congress President in 1924. He is shown on the stamps released by India in 1985 marking the partys centenary. The other noteworthy stamps have been themed on Salt Satyagraha, Dandi March, and the Quit India Movement. A celebrated stamp was released in the millenniums first year based on Gandhis caricature by a well-known cartoonist that also bears semblance to the outline map of India. Mahatma Gandhi, Man of the Millennium was the theme of the stamps issued the next year.
The charkha, as the symbol of non-violence, is a leitmotif on the stamps on Gandhi, and in 2011, the India Post released the worlds first khadi stamp. The unique diamond-shaped Z100-denomination stamp shows Gandhis face in profile and the charkha on khadi cloth with his words, Be true.
Besides stamps, Gandhi has been featured on the India Posts prepaid postal stationery such as inland letter cards, postcards, and envelopes. There are also permanent cancellations issued from post offices in Gujarat, showing the Alfred High School where Gandhi received his education, his ancestral home, and the Kocharab Satyagraha Ashram.
A unique special cover with a hologram showing Gandhi was also introduced by the South India Philatelists Association, with the Postal Departments approval. Globally, stamps and postal stationery on Gandhi have been released by more than 90 countries. The United States of America, Mauritius, Fiji, Switzerland, Guyana, Poland, Bhutan, Myanmar, Mexico, Iran, Ireland, and the former Union of Soviet Socialist Republics are only some of the countries. Britain, despite having the tradition of not issuing a stamp on a non-British personality, issued a Gandhi stamp in 1969.
The United Nations too, issued a stamp on Gandhi in 2009 designed by Miami-based artist Dr. Ferdie Pacheco.
Pacheco said that the colours in the stamp depict what Gandhi epitomised: I chose these colours: red because it is the colour of energy; his energy, even when he was fasting; green the colour of healing, white of purity, blue of serenity, yellow of balance, and brown of the Earth as he helped people. All these colours represent a peaceful man who helped the world.

PCOI probing SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka
Hundreds of millions of rupees from EPF invested in eight unlisted companies - Witness
Hundreds of millions of rupees belonging to the Employees Provident Fund (EPF), the largest Social Security Scheme in Sri Lanka has been invested in eight unlisted companies including the SriLankan Airlines (SLA), it was revealed before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCOI) on SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and the Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd yesterday.
According to the testimony of EPF Superintendent of CBSL, Nalini Malkanthi Bandara which continued for the second day, it was also revealed that the EPF has not received returns by investing in four of these eight companies including the SLA.
The EPF has invested Rs.5 Billion in Canvil Holdings, Rs.2.9 Billion in West Coast Company, Rs.1 Billion SriLankan Catering, Rs.500 Million in SriLankan Airlines, Rs.495 Million in Cargills Bank, Rs.450 Million in Weligama Hotel Properties Company, Rs. 350 Million in Jetwing Symphony Company, and also in Fitch Ratings Company.
According to the EPF Act No. 15 of 1958, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is the sole authority of investing EPF fund. Therefore, it should make a determination before making any investment using EPF funds. The most highlighting thing that was revealed through Bandaras testimony pertaining to the investment made with the SLA is that the CBSL has no any plan or prior study for this investment in its possession. The investment was made in July 2010, during the tenure of former CBSL Governor Ajith Nivard Cabraal and Treasury Secretary P.B.Jayasundara, who was a permanent member to the Monetary Board.
The Investment Committee of the EPF had sent its recommendations without carrying out any study pertaining to this investment and the Monetary Board had ratified it without any plan or related document, it was revealed.
The other thing highlighted yesterday was that according to the Investment and Trading Guideline of the EPF published on March 21, 2007, there are no provisions to purchase shares of unlisted companies.
When asked by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe, who led evidence, as to whether the EPF was benefitted from the investment, the witness said that there have been no returns from this investment so far. However, the investment has been recorded in the accounts book as a notional value of Rs. 100.

India, most sought-after business destination: Online search data
Starting a business India happens to have become the most-preferred destination in the world to do so, if one goes by the number of people searching for the best place to set up shop.
A study conducted by SEMrush, an online digital marketing suite, revealed that India leads the Top 10 globally most searched countries online for starting business in. The study has established the fact that India is not just a preferred choice for Indians to do business in their homeland, but is also becoming a priority for SMEs from across the world, according to a company official.
Rohan Ayyar, Regional Marketing Manager India, SEMrush, says the number of SMEs in India is 4.25 crore, registered and unregistered, with over 10 per cent average growth rate. He was quoting a report by EVOMA. The GDP contribution by SMEs is estimated to be around 6.11 per cent from the manufacturing and 24.63 per cent from the service sectors, he said. SEMrush analysed the global search pattern for the last 12 months and looked for certain key search terms such as how to start a company in, opening business in, found a business in and other related search queries.
The study showed India is followed by Singapore, the Philippines and Australia as top globally searched nations.
Though Singapore is famous for its wide entrepreneurial opportunities, and the National University of Singapore, the oldest and the largest university in the country, ranks in the global Top 30 for its entrepreneurship centre and international outlook, the nation was at second spot, according to the SEMrush study. Ayyar said unemployment rate of 2.1 per cent and per capita GDP of nearly $53,000 tend to make Singapores economy one of the strongest on the world arena, and almost 99 per cent of it is powered by SMEs. It is no surprise that Singapore tops the list of countries where people are eager to found a firm, he said.
Ayyar added the results of search queries analyses over 2017-18 were greatly commemorative. The search volumes for India were much higher in comparison with countries such as Australia, Canada and the UAE. The developments in PPP model and progressive policies and plans have further helped start-ups and businesses to grow, giving a great boost to SMEs.

Indonesia asks for help, buries tsunami dead
INDONESIA: Indonesian volunteers began burying bodies in a mass grave with space for more than a thousand people on Monday, victims of a quake and tsunami that devastated swathes of Sulawesi and left authorities struggling to deal with the sheer scale of the disaster.
Indonesia is no stranger to natural calamities and Jakarta had been keen to show it could deal with a catastrophe that has killed over 1,200 people so far according to the official toll.
But four days on some remote areas have yet to be contacted, medicines are running out and rescuers are struggling with a shortage of heavy equipment as they try to reach desperate victims calling out from the ruins of collapsed buildings.
An excavator is used to bury quake victims in a mass grave in Palu, in Central Sulawesi yesterday. - AFP
In response, President Joko Widodo opened the door to the dozens of international aid agencies and NGOs who are lined up to provide live-saving assistance.
Last night, President @jokowi authorized us to accept international help for urgent disaster-response & relief, senior government official Tom Lembong wrote on Twitter on Monday.
Officials fear the toll will rise steeply in the coming days and are preparing for the worst, declaring a 14-day state of emergency.
At Poboya -- in the hills above the devastated seaside city of Palu -- volunteers began to fill a vast grave with the dead, with instructions to prepare for 1,300 victims to be laid to rest.
Authorities are desperate to stave off any disease outbreak caused by decomposing bodies.
Three trucks arrived stacked with corpses wrapped in orange, yellow and black bags, an AFP reporter on the scene saw. One-by-one they were dragged into the grave as excavators poured soil on top.
In Balaroa, a Palu suburb once home to a housing complex, the scale of the damage was obvious. A wasteland of flattened trees, shards of concrete, twisted metal roofing, doorframes and mangled furniture stretched out into the distance. Dazed groups of people ambled over the wreckage, unclear where or how to start digging. Among them were three men looking for their younger brother.
Rescuers are racing against the clock and a lack of equipment to save those still trapped in the rubble, with up to 60 people feared to be underneath one Palu hotel alone.
Two survivors have been plucked from the 80-room Hotel Roa-Roa, Indonesias search and rescue agency said, and there could still be more alive. Desperate survivors turned to looting shops for basics like food, water and fuel as police looked on, unwilling or unable to intervene.
There has been no aid, we need to eat. We dont have any other choice, we must get food, one man in Palu told AFP as he filled a basket with goods from a nearby store.
Meanwhile government officials said some 1,200 inmates fled at least three prisons in the region.
Im sure they escaped because they feared they would be affected by the earthquake. This is for sure a matter of life and death for the prisoners, Ministry of Justice official Sri Puguh Utami said.
Many survivors have spent the last days desperately searching for loved ones while dealing with the trauma of the disaster.
One survivor, Adi, was hugging his wife by the beach when the tsunami struck on Friday. He has no idea where she is now, or whether she is alive.
When the wave came, I lost her, he said. I was carried about 50 metres. I couldnt hold anything, he said.
Others have centred their search for loved ones around open-air morgues, where the dead lay in the baking sun -- waiting to be claimed, waiting to be named.
As dire as the situation in Palu is, it was at least clear. In outlying areas, the fate of thousands is still unknown.
Indonesias Metro TV broadcast aerial footage from a coastal community in Donggala, close to the epicentre of the quake and from Petobo, where the devastation appeared extensive.
Yenni Suryani, of Catholic Relief Services, said devastated infrastructure was hampering rescue efforts.
Humanitarian groups are struggling to get people into affected areas, she said. The main airport at Palu was damaged, landslides had cut off key roads while power is out almost everywhere, she added.
The local airport has been cleared to receive humanitarian and commercial flights, but so far the landing slots have been taken up by Indonesias powerful military, which is staging its own assistance efforts.
Satellite imagery provided by regional relief teams showed severe damage at some of the areas major ports, with large ships tossed on land, quays and bridges trashed and shipping containers thrown around.
A double-arched yellow bridge had collapsed, its ribs twisted as cars bobbed in the water below.
Indonesia, home to 260 million people, is one of the worlds most disaster-prone nations.
It lies on the Pacific Ring of Fire, where tectonic plates collide and many of the worlds volcanic eruptions and earthquakes occur.
A massive 2004 quake triggered a tsunami that killed 220,000 throughout the region, including 168,000 in Indonesia. - AFP

Cornerstone laid for China-SL Water Technology Research Centre
'Integrated management, key to effective use of water'
The cornerstone ceremony for the China-Sri Lanka Joint Research and Demonstration Centre for Water Technology, which is to be built at a cost of Rs.2.83 billion at the University of Peradeniya, was held recently.
Yang Zuoyuan, the Economic and Commercial Counsellor at the Chinese Embassy in Sri Lanka, said that the Chinese Government would provide a grant for the purpose, in order to help improve the health of Sri Lankan people as well as to ensure the quality of drinking water.
We are convinced that in future, we will see a modern, high-quality water technology research and demonstration centre in Kandy, which will play a vital role in improving the expertise of water technology research in Sri Lanka, Zuoyuan said.
He said that the construction of the project would be carried out by the China Tiesiju Civil Engineering Group (CTCE), which was the flagship subsidiary of the China Railway Group: the world's second largest construction contractor.
The CTCE developed its business in 20 countries around the world. I believe that it will complete the mission with success and make due contribution to the friendship between China and Sri Lanka, he added.
He said that at present, the relations between China and the Sri Lanka had shown a sound momentum.
The two sides maintain frequent and high-level exchanges and political mutual trust has been strengthened, while cooperation in various fields has been deepened. Sri Lanka is actively involved in the Belt and Road Initiative, which promotes the sustainable development of the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership, Zuoyuan added.
City Planning and Water Supply Ministry Secretary D.G.M.V. Hapuarachchi said that the issue of water and health was not limited to a country or a region; rather, it was a global concern and hence, was the responsibility of the world.
Integrated water resource-management is the key to effective and optimum utilisation and preservation of this threatened and precious resource. Innovative solutions and appropriate technologies should be adopted to overcome funding constraints. Widely accepted water safety plans which could reach more people should be implemented in order to achieve more health benefits, he said.
The City Planning and Water Supply Ministry and the National Water Supply and Drainage Board had taken steps to expand the water supply coverage in Sri Lanka to achieve a 60-percent target by 2020, the Secretary added.
He said that one of the key areas to be focused on with regard to coverage-expansion, was to address the drinking water issues of the people suffering from chronic kidney disease.
Chronic kidney disease in Sri Lanka was a burning issue as many cases were of unknown etiology. The disease had spread throughout 11 districts in Sri Lanka, mainly due to changes in various human activities, as well as environmental factors, Hapuarachchi said.
Over the past 30 years, it had become a major health issue. The disease was seen among farmers in the 40 to 60 age group. The impact it had on farmers affected the social and economic development of the country, and majority of researchers believed that the cause of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Etiology (CKDu) was the consumption of contaminated water, he added.
The project called ChinaSri Lanka Collaborative Grant Research Project on CKDu was launched following the signing of a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) by Urban Development, Water Supply and Drainage Minister Rauff Hakeem and Chinese Academy of Sciences President Prof. Chunli Bai on March 26, 2015. That was the cornerstone of the China-Sri Lanka Research grant, he said.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 04:
A jack of all trades can run small business successfully
Last week we ended up within ventorying your skills, interests, and job history. Today, we start from that point.
The following questions can help you take an inventory of your business expertise and interests. (You can get a piece of paper and treat these questions like a quiz if you want to.) The answers you get will help you select the best possible business opportunity for you.
Questions to be answered
If you were in business field, what top-three business skills have you displayed over your business career Examples include sales, accounting, marketing, administration, writing, communications, quantitative analysis, hiring, training, employee motivation, product development, customer service, focus, delegation, accountability, attention to detail, and so on. In which business skills are you the weakest Refer to the examples in the preceding bullet for ideas.
Over your working history (including part-time and full-time jobs), what three jobs have you enjoyed the most and why After listing three jobs, consider (and list) the reasons why you liked those particular jobs. During your working history, what three jobs have you enjoyed the least and why Similar to the preceding question, consider and then list the reasons why you disliked those particular jobs.
What were your top-three overall personal skills Examples include leadership, communication, intelligence, creativity, vision, cheerleading, invention and/or innovation, listening, problem solving, counselling, and so on. If we live in a perfect world and you could select the industry in which youd like to spend the rest of your life, what would be your top-three choices
Examples include sports, music, movies, art, finance, education, telecommunications, electronics, computers, medicine, architecture, agriculture, transportation, insurance, real estate, financial services, food and beverage services, apparel design and manufacture, furniture and home products, outdoor products, printing, photography, chemistry, plastics, and so on.
What three favourite hobbies or special interests of yours might be conducive to creating a business Many people turn a hobby or special interest (such as photography, golf, or coin collecting) into a business. Given what you know about the retailing, service, manufacturing, and wholesale career choices, rank these four in order of desirability. Refer to the earlier section Consider your category for details on each of these categories.
Stimulating your thought processes
A little warning is warranted here. Dont expect to answer these questions and determine that you should immediately open a retail clothing store, start a financial consulting business, or import rare ostrich eggs. Instead, use these questions to help you inventory your skills, interests, and job history. The results should help stimulate the thought processes that will assist you in developing a list of businesses that may work for you.
If, for example, your strengths (and interests) are in sales, you may want to consider a business where sales will be the primary function of the business (manufacturers representative, for instance). If you indicate that you have weaknesses in such areas as attention to detail, delegation, and administration, you may want to consider operating a business solo as opposed to one that requires employees.
If you determine that over your job history, you didnt like those jobs where you dealt directly with customers, the retail business would probably not work for you.
These questions are intended to help you take an introspective look at yourself and lead you to where you would logically fit in the broad spectrum of business opportunities. Thats why we say youll find no quick answers here, but rather an opportunity to jump-start the narrowing-down process. Come back to these questions several times over a period of weeks because few people arrive at a solution the first time through.
Narrow your choices
When considering a business opportunity, you need to answer the following questions to assure yourself that the business youre considering is the right one for you:
Is it a business that suits your personality
l Consider a retail business if you like dealing directly with people, dont mind keeping regular hours, and can handle being tied to one spot for long periods of time. The converse, of course, also applies.
l Consider the service business if you like dealing with people, solving problems, and working in spurts and flurries.
l Consider a wholesaling business if youre a detail-oriented person, if you enjoy supervising employees, and if you dont mind risking the significant amount of capital that carrying and distributing inventory requires.
l Consider the manufacturing business if youre a quality-conscious and detail-oriented person who enjoys searching for solutions to such issues as process and flow and quality control. You should also enjoy supervising employees.
Within each of the four major business categories, you can get more specific and narrow down your choices to specific industries. For example:
l Consider the financial services or accounting/tax-preparation business if you like working with numbers.
l Consider the restaurant or entertainment business if you dont mind working unusual hours.
l Consider a banking, telephone sales, or consulting business if you dont mind spending long periods of time sitting at a desk.
Is it a business or product in which you have experience Experience is the worlds best teacher. If you dont have it, your competitors who do have it are bound to have a sizable competitive edge over you. Sixty percent of successful business owners have gravitated to products or services in industries with which they were previously familiar.
Is it a business you can afford A service business is usually the least expensive of the four business categories to start, followed by retailing, wholesaling, and, finally, manufacturing. Few more cautionary remarks here are justified. You should take into consideration the amount of money you have and can borrow, or find investors for, when answering this question.
Further questions
Is it a business with too much risk Can you live with the risk inherent in this business Generally, the bigger the capital requirement, the larger the risk. Are you sure youre prepared to live with the risk of starting a manufacturing company If not, consider becoming a service provider instead - its more suited to the average pocketbook.
Is it a business in which you have a competitive advantage Can you make, service, or sell your product better If not, you need to ask yourself what will motivate your customers to work with you. (If your answer is price, youre in trouble already, unless youve figured out a clear and high-quality way to create and deliver a product or service cheaper and better than the industry leaders.)
Is it a business in which you can become a specialist Theres power in being a specialist, and theres danger in being a generalist. Todays movers and shakers have learned a valuable lesson from past experience: Focus on doing those things you can do better than anyone else.
Do you believe in the industry you plan to do business in Some industries arent for everyone. Be sure to select an industry that will allow you to sleep at night and feel good about what youre doing. Is it an industry that isnt overcrowded or dominated by a few well-marketed companies You say youre thinking about a coffee house Youd better know something or be prepared to offer a different product or service than well-established companies).
Every industry has a saturation point; you want to make sure that your chosen industry isnt one of them. (You can usually determine the saturation point by observing how successful the existing businesses are.) Is your potential business in an industry thats moving at a pace that you could be comfortable with Some industries move faster than others; for example, the biotech industry moves faster than the gift-shop industry.
Make sure that you have a comfort level with the pace of your chosen industry. Some industries will leave you breathless (and moneyless) if you cant keep up with the pace. The gift-shop industry will leave you bleary eyed and passionless if you thrive on the rush you get from constant activity and change. Is it an industry that you can get passionate about Can you love the product and the customers Passion helps sell products to customers and vision to employees.
Recognize your number one asset
Most of us are not born wizards. We dont have their sense of detail, their drive, their leadership abilities, or their visions for their niches. But the world has plenty of room for folks like us develop ourselves if we possess passion and high degree of commitment.
Visit any outstation community in Sri Lanka, and even the smallest will have a number of business maestros those small-business owners who have made their grocery or furniture or tailoring store the best in the area, those small-business owners who build the best aluminium gates and railings in the area, and those small-business owners who sell more kavum, kokis and other traditional sweets than anyone else. You dont have to be the largest retailer in the country to be a smashing success. Plenty of mini business wizards are hanging around.
And so, it will be for you if you choose to follow in right footsteps as guided by us - you alone will either make or break your company. Sure, the niche will be important, but you will select it. And certainly, your employees will be important, but you will choose the people you hire (and the people you fire).
And, of course, your products (or services) will be important, but you will have the final word in defining them. Everything that happens within your business will have your own personal stamp on it. Nothing will be outside of your grasp. The small-business owner is the number one determinant of his or her companys success or failure.

KDUs sixth intake 30th anniversary
To mark the 30th anniversary of the sixth intake of the Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) which falls on October 5, a felicitation ceremony would be held for its members who had sacrificed their lives for the country, as well as for those who are still in service, retired or disabled.
A batch of 116 youths joined the KDU, Sri Lankas first Defence Academy, on October 5, 1988. As dynamic young minds, they joined the armed forces to safeguard their motherland. It was the beginning of long and respectable profession; a process that transformed civilians to military personnel.
We had just felt the smell of gunpowder during the war when most of our batch mates were sent to the battlefronts in the North and the East at the height of terrorism in the country. Leading the armed forces as young officers and brave platoon commanders was the need of the county at that critical juncture. As commissioned officers, they were present in the battlefront as infantrymen, on gun boats and warships and on board military aircrafts, Anniversary Celebrations Steering Committee Secretary Colonel Laksiri Perera said.
We take this opportunity to once again salute late Prime Minister and KDU Founder Sir John Kotelawala, our alma mater, the present and past commanders of the Tri-forces, military and academic staff, instructors, as well as our parents, for making us brave sons who could significantly contribute to protect the territorial integrity and sovereignty of our motherland, the colonel added.
This year, the alumnai of the KDU's sixth intake, along with their families, will pay tribute to our loving batch mates for their supreme sacrifice. The valour and courage they displayed in the battlefield will be remembered forever. We will not forget the spirit-de-corps and wonderful memories created. The precious time you devoted for the motherland, the loyalty and faith towards the country, is supreme, Anniversary Celebrations Steering Committee Chairman retired Major Mahinda Adikari said.
There were 116 members in our batch, and it is known to be the largest ever intake in the history of the KDU. It is disheartening that 12 batch mates left us laying their precious lives in the name of Sri Lanka. Another two passed away due to tragic circumstances. The families of war heroes, serving and retired, batch mates, friends, and well-wishers, will take part in a religious ceremony at the Gangarama Temple, Colombo. A commemoration ceremony will also be held to pay military tribute to fallen heroes at the War Memorial at the Parliament complex in Sri Jayawardenepura on October 4, Adikari added.

Laws to control salt in foods soon
The salt content in processed food can be controlled by legislation and Sri Lanka is working on this. We are also planning a media campaign to make people aware of the importance of reducing individual salt consumption, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne was speaking at the Friends of the United Nations Inter-Agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of Non-Communicable Diseases held at the UN headquarters in New York recently.
Minister Senaratne said he believes increasing the sugar tax should be included in the NCD agenda.
One problem we all face in the fight against trans-fats is the technical snags in correctly and accurately identifying levels of trans-fats in foods.
On the other hand, although the informal food industry uses higher levels of trans-fats in their products than the established food manufacturers, we have found regulating the sector a daunting task, the Minister said.

Learning app gets $71.9m from IPO
LAIX Inc, creator of English learning app Liulishuo, raised roughly $71.9 million in its Wall Street trading debu, as it readies itself for expansion in the booming online education market.
Shares of the Shanghai-based firm closed up 1.2 percent at $12.65 per share on the New York Stock Exchange, after opening up 28 percent on Thursday morning.
Proceeds from the IPO will be used to finance research and development, as well as to continue to invest in and develop its current technologies, according to CEO Wang Yi.
The company also plans to boost its marketing activities to acquire more users and further strengthen its brand, as well as expand into the overseas market in the future, he said, without elaborating on details.
LAIX refers to Life empowered by AI to reach (X) infinite possibilities, said Wang ahead of the IPO, explaining the firms rebranding. The listing will make us a more international company and help us to attract customers all over the world.
Founded in 2013 by Wang, a Princeton graduate and former product manager at Google Inc, Liulishuo - which means speaking fluently - aims to disrupt Chinas conventional brick-and-mortar language schools, by using AI, rather than humans, to teach English.
It records users speech patterns before providing customized lessons and tips on how to sound more like a native English speaker.
The company had 83.8 million cumulative registered users globally at the end of June, according to its prospectus. It gives away basic lessons for free and charges fees for more advanced tutoring. It currently has more than 1 million paying customers.
From day one we have not ruled out the possibility of delving into other realms using AI. But English learning is the one area that we would like to focus on right now, Wang said. Consultancy iResearch forecast that Chinas booming online education market is poised to grow 20 percent annually, reaching 270 billion yuan ($39.2 billion) by 2019.
This sentiment of continuous progress in the workplace is driving young Chinese white-collar workers toward a long-term remedy: education, said Du Miaomiao, an iResearch analyst.
Hujiang EdTech, VIPKid and iTutorGroup are among the startups that have raised funds recently to bankroll their expansion, and have adopted algorithms to optimize their products.
Our users are shifting from learn to survive to learn to advance and have fun, said Wang. AI is set to make the learning process more efficient, tailored and accessible.

## Title: LKR under Pressure-How Not to Crack
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Finance

LKR under Pressure-How Not to Crack
The Sri Lankan currency (LKR) has weakened against the US dollar in 2018 (9.4% as at 26 September 2018) with close to 4% of the depreciation being recorded in the last two weeks. Currencies like the Indian rupee, Indonesian rupiah and Philippines peso have also seen steep depreciation so far in 2018.The weakness is in the backdrop of adverse global and local factors.
What are some of these factors
Stronger U.S. dollar  The US dollar is the reserve currency of the world and domestic currencies are referenced against it. When the US dollar strengthens, there is an opposite depreciatory pressure on local currency.In 2017, the US dollar weakened about 10% against a basket of currencies. As a result, most currencies were either stable or appreciated against the US dollar. The LKR only weakened 2%. However, this year it is quite the opposite with the strengthening of the US dollar with money flowing back to markets like the U.S which are termed to be haven investments when there is a high level of uncertainty and risk in global markets.
Impact of tight monetary policy in the U.S.  The U.S Federal Reserve has increased interest rates 8 times since December 2015 bringing to a gradual close a period of easy money flowing into emerging and frontier markets like Sri Lanka. Most of the other Central Banks globally have signalled a similar direction in terms of monetary policy. This has led to most emerging economies recording capital outflows from bond and equity markets. Sri Lanka has seen a foreign outflow of Rs 64 billion from the local Tw reasury Bill and Bond market since the last week of April. In the first three weeks of September alone, there were outflows of Rs 18 billion.
Impact of trade war  The trade war between the U.S. and China has increased trade and geo-political tensions with both countries engaging in imposing higher tariff on imported bilateral goods. This has derailed the positive trade growth momentum that was expected to continue into 2018 and benefit economies like Sri Lanka. As a result of this geo-political tension, global investor have tended to investment in less risk assets adding to the portfolio outflows from markets like Sri Lanka.
Higher oil prices and widening trade deficit  The rise in oil prices has exposed the sensitivity that net oil importing countries like Sri Lanka face. This coupled with higher imports in items like Gold and consumer goods has seen Sri Lankas imports widening by 12.7% in the first half of 2018.
Current account deficit countries most vulnerable Countries with current account deficits like India and Sri Lanka are most vulnerable during times of global volatility. The exposure to capital inflows to balance the deficits is highlighted in period such as this.
What the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has said and done
The Ceylon Chamber invited the Senior Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL), Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe to address the monthly Chamber Committee meeting in September. In his address he covered the following areas:
Dont panic-while explaining the reasoning for the recent weakness in the currency, he urged the private sector to be more rationale in their thinking of the future movement of the currency and not take panic decisions.
Measures to arrest LKR weakness- he explained the measures taken by the CBSL during the year to address the pressure on the currency. Some of these were the imposition of the 15% custom duty on global imports from 18 April 2018, imposition of a 100% margin deposit requirement against the Letters of Credit opened with commercial bank in importing motor vehicle from the 19 September 2018.
Expect limited intervention - Dr. Weerasinghe also explained that the CBSL will only conduct limited interventions to prevent sharp volatility of the Sri Lanka rupee and will not intervene given the learnings from the past where reserves were unsuccessfully used to defend the currency which then eventually depreciated sharply (during 2011/12 and 2015). He explained that they would also look at strongly enforcing the exporter repatriation rules to help ease the pressure on the currency.
Hedge currency exposure-Dr. Weerasinghe also advised the private sector to use the available forward market instruments to create hedges against possible exposure to currency risks.
What next
The economy is in a difficult period given the external factors that are weighing in. A reversal of some of the factors mentioned above will ease some of the pressure. In the near-term a reversal looks unlikely. Here are a few steps that can be taken to ensure that a slide does not continue:
Rebuild confidence in the economy-a key factor in mitigating a further weakness of the currency is for policymaker and government to restore confidence in the economy and the future trajectory of the LKR. This can be ensured through credible policies that will ensure policy predictability and an improvement in overall economic sentiment.
Keep indicators in check-The LKR weakness underscores the need to ensure that Sri Lanka keeps indicators like the budget deficit and current account deficit in check. The CBSL policy decision to not use gross official reserves excessively to temporarily defend the currency is a sound move given the need to have a strong enough buffer to meet the debt refinancing challenges the economy will face in the next few years. Indonesia has used up over USD 13 billion in foreign-currency reserves in the first eight months of the 2018 but have seen the currency loosing almost 10% highlighting that such measures may not always avert a currency slide.
Avoid disruptive short-term measures- policymakers should not look to curtail imports unless where deemed necessary. Short-term measures to curtail imports will distort business activity. Ad-hoc raising of para-tariffs will not be in line with proposed tariff liberalisation program that the Ministry of Finance has announced. Policymakers should look at curbing unnecessary government expenditure rather than imports which will have an impact on businesses and economic activity.
Overall, the recent LKR weakness emphasises the need for the government to improve the economys resilience to external shocks by pushing forward reforms that will benefit the economy through higher level of dollar income from exports, services and investment. The emerging global financial markets paradigm with higher interest rates globally will see future spells of currency pressure to which the Sri Lankan economy will need to be prepared for.

Next years Health budget to top US$ 1 bn
The Government will allocate over US$ one Billion for health for next year. This is around 1.5 percent from the Gross Domestic Product (GDP), National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha De Silva said.
According to State Minister De Silva, next years health budget in Sri Lanka will only be second to the Defence budget.
Sri Lanka has pretty decent health indicators and primary health care system when comparing with the other countries in the region. He was addressing the Policy Forum on Hypertension and Cardio-metabolic diseases - Impact on health systems in Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, Pakistan and regional countries held in Colombo yesterday.
State Minister De Silva said that Sri Lanka is now in the 76th place among 188 countries when it comes to the Human Development Index and this ranked 0.77 in the index which is above the average of 0.76.
This is a significant achievement for Sri Lanka. The free heal care and education available in Sri Lanka contributed towards achieving this level.
There was no ambulance service for Sri Lankans to transport patients to a hospital until 2016. In 2016 the service was launched in Sri Lanka and over 100,300 patients had been transported by the service by now. The service will be expanded to all over the country by the end of this year. The call centre answered 98.7 percent calls within two seconds providing the fastest service in the region or may be in the world, he added.

Nuggets rout Lakers, spoil James exhibition debut
San Diego, Monday: LeBron James dazzled the crowd in his exhibition debut for the Los Angeles Lakers Sunday but he couldn't get them a victory as they dropped a 124-107 decision to the Denver Nuggets. James finished with nine points, three rebounds and four assists in just over 15 minutes of playing time in front of 13,500 fans at the Valley View Casino in San Diego. "It was great to get back on the floor and start a new journey for myself," he said. "It was great to hear the roar from the (San Diego) crowd."
James was cheered throughout the contest with one of the biggest ovations coming when he emerged from the tunnel for the pre-game warmup.
He played eight minutes before sitting down on the bench.James left the Cleveland Cavaliers for a four-year, $153 million free-agent deal with the Lakers. Lakers fans feel James is just what the struggling team needs during its worst half-decade in history. The Lakers' regular-season opener is October 18 at Portland, followed two nights later by their first home game against Houston. AFP

Pakistan, India square off over botched cricket agreement
Dubai, Monday: Pakistan and India squared off at the legal crease at a hearing at the International Cricket Council headquarters in Dubai Monday after the two sides failed to honour a deal to compete in several bilateral series.
The Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) is demanding 70 million dollars in compensation from India, claiming that a memorandum of understanding signed in 2014 had guaranteed six bilateral series between 2015 and 2023.
However the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) have said they are unable to play against Pakistan until their government gives them permission and dismissed the agreement as not legally binding.
The hearing is set to last until October 3.
ICCs chief executive David Richardson last week urged the two nations to resolve the matter between themselves rather than seeking arbitration.
It is a matter between India and Pakistan. We would like the resumption of ties between the two nations on a bilateral basis, said Richardson.
We will facilitate any settlement decision if we can. Other than that, it is up to the two nations.
India-Pakistan ties, including sports and cultural contacts, plummeted after the 2008 militant attacks in Mumbai, which New Delhi blamed on Pakistani militant groups.
There has been just one bilateral tour since, when Pakistan visited India to play two Twenty20s and three one-day internationals in December 2012 and January 2013.
Pakistan and India continue to play each other in international events, including last months Asia Cup in Dubai.
India won that event while Pakistan failed to reach the final. AFP

Pan Asia Bank finances Drip Irrigation solutions
Ipalogama in Anuradhapura, which is located in Sri Lankas ancient Kingdom of Raja Rata became the beneficiary of Pan Asia Banks latest venture to empower farmers with financing of Drip Irrigation systems.
Ipalogama which has always contributed to the countrys economy with its agricultural and farming industries is now increasingly moving towards more commercially viable cultivations utilizing better farming tech techniques. In this backdrop Pan Asia Bank identified the need to assist the enterprising farmers of Ipalogama when its Development Banking Division officials visited the area to provide small scale entrepreneurs with financial assistance to expand their businesses.
Impressed by both the villages agriculture friendly climate and the determination of its youth who were determined to make their agricultural endeavors a commercial success, we decided to help them out by selecting several families to begin guava cultivation in the area. With the financial assistance and coordination of our Kekirawa branch, we were able to offer start-up guava farmers viable refinancing plans (with interest as low as 5.5%) under the Central Bank Swashakthi Loan Scheme during the first half of 2017. Under the careful supervision of our Kekirawa branch, guava cultivation increased in leaps and bounds to exceed over 75 acres in the area said Ranjith Athukorala, Assistant Manager-Development Banking of Pan Asia Bank.
Banks involvement and commitment to assist the farmers of Ipalogama did not stop there as they realized that in order to reap the full benefits of their efforts; farmers of Ipalogama had to be introduced to better agricultural technologies. Hence, Pan Asia Bank decided to help them increase their harvest and substantially reduce cultivation costs by joining hands with the Global Climate Partnership Fund (GCPF), which is an investment fund dedicated to energy conservation and sustainable environment management. With this collaboration, the bank began introducing guava cultivation to farmers in Ipalogama for export purposes.
During our initial research conducted it was revealed that over 75% of guava farmers used inefficient irrigation methods that wasted both water and energy; while a further 20% provided their plantations with insufficient water due to ignorance. Based on these factors, we decided to first educate guava farmers on the benefits of Drip Irrigation and then, as the second stage, help them set-up drip irrigation systems on their plantations. We also organized a technical workshop including a field visit, sponsored by Bartleet Agrotronics, that enabled farmers to benefit from the specialized knowledge and expertise of Drip Irrigation Systems in India, Athukorala said.
Accordingly, the first stage of this innovative Drip Irrigation System project was launched in Ipalogma on September 21, 2018 in the presence of Nimal Thilakaratne, Director/Chief Executive Officer, Pan Asia Bank; Naleen Edirisinghe, Deputy General Manager and other senior management officials. The bank provided financing for this irrigation project under Govi Navoda Loan Scheme recently launched by the government as part of its Enterprises Sri Lanka initiative offering loans at interest rates as low as 3.375%.
Our aim through this project is to empower the farming community to prosper by introducing them to the latest technology and enabling them to contribute to the countrys development. We believe that with the commitment they already have, if we can help them embrace the new agricultural techniques, it would substantially strengthen their economy and living standards said Pan Asia Banks Director Nimal Tillekeratne, addressing the gathering at the launch ceremony.
Coordination for this project was done by Sujith Dissanayake of the Micro Loans Division, Pan Asia Bank Kekirawa under the guidance of Ranjith Athukorala, Head of Development Loans and Naleen Edirisinghe-DGM-Branch Credit of Pan Asia Bank.

Parents to blame for  the weird name game
Everyone is aware that names are sometimes randomly forced on children. And I am talking about real names, not pet names or nicknames. Parents should be aware of the likelihood for potential embarrassment before thrusting monikers on kids with unusual or bizarre names. In many cases parents do not reflect on the repercussions arising from peculiar names that could make children a target of abuse and derision for the rest of their lives.
Be aware that many Sri Lankan parents through the years have been naming their kids with all kinds of normal anglo-saxon appellatives that are mangled in the local nomenclature. For instance, my former colleague Kirthie Abeyesekera once regaled us with the story about an aunt named Alan.
He questioned her on several occasions whether her actual name was Helen or Ellen. But she vociferously rebutted his logical conclusion that Alan was a name usually reserved for the males of the species. Despite his arguments to the contrary Alan it was and Alan it remained even when he had to pen her newspaper obituary.
Now all those lads dubbed Kingsley in Sri Lanka, have often had their monikers jumbled in the Sinhala articulation which was intoned as Kinisley or Kinsily. Take Sean Connery for example, the first thespian to play the role of the rugged James Bond. Many Sri Lankans at the time pronounced the name as Seen when it should have been Shawn. And who the devil could have blamed them when the spelling did not match its Celtic pronunciation.
Take Worcestershire for instance. Now for sure this one is not a childs name , although it is one of the most hotly debated. Most British people will tell you to just say Woo-stah and drop the shire on the end, especially if youre talking about the famous Worcestershire sauce. Dont be fooled by the ces in the middle. It doesnt really do anything, kind of like that mysterious light switch on your wall or your pet goldfish. If you can say Worcester, I have faith that you can figure out how to pronounce its English cousin.
Just as Gloucester is pronounced Gloster. Dont blame the English, blame the Romans, and every other occupiers of the country in the Dark Ages. And never attempt to address people named Menzies unless you are sure of the right intonation, if you get what I mean. There were these twin brothers from a backwoods Sri Lankan village who were Christened Thomas and Tobias. When they transferred to the capital for their schooling their peers called them Tommy and Toby in the best English public school tradition.
But back in the village they were known as Tomma and Toba. Then there was the Sri Lankan artist who worked for a magazine in Hong Kong. His wife soon joined him. No one knew her real name but everyone suspected it was something traditionally Sri Lankan gamey-ish. So the artist chappie searched for a more suitable one and settled for the name Sandhya. As time went by the name kept changing until he hit on the westernized moniker of Sandy.
Some perfectly acceptable surnames could in certain circumstances be construed as hilarious. Many names are quite suitable until say, a girl with a perfectly ordinary moniker marries and as is customary goes under her husbands surname. That is why I suspect a good many of them stick to their maiden names.
Nearly everyone of my vintage is aware of the story of a vivacious young nurse named Annette Jayamanne who attracted a great many suitors while she flitted around the Kandy Hospital performing her Nightingale duties. She finally accepted the hand of a personable young planter named Bevis Hill and left the nursing service. A month or so after the wedding, a former admirer, unaware of Annettes marital status, called at the hospital with a bouquet of flowers.
An attendant at the Kandy Hospital politely inquired from the young man as to whether he was visiting a patient. He replied that he was calling on the nurse, Miss Jayamanne. The know-all attendant informed him with a hilarious economy of words: Jayamanne Missy thang mehe nehe. Jayamanne Missy giya maasay Hill una.
On the flip side overseas I have come across some of the most uncanny real names that have made my head spin like a Murali doosra. I have worked in newsrooms that were peopled with names such as Barbara Dwyer, who we naturally called Barbed Wire, the horse racing correspondent in Singapore Russel Nales was nicknamed Rusty Nails.
Many Chinese people are bent on giving themselves an English name. But have you noticed many of them choose some of the really weird ones. Take the name Jackie. I personally know five people with this name, three male and two females. I know another girl named Ricky. I also know a woman who calls herself Bobby. There are other females who favour monikers such as Sincere, Winkie, Pinky Dinkie and Dickie. The names of some of the men I knew included Cathedral, Timbo, Champers, Dodgy, Magnum and Donga!
Even many Westerners think nothing of going by their unusual names. A news reporter named Christine Cross, became quite cross when her colleagues referred to her as Chris Cross. Another was an attractive Canadian named Seymour Legge (See More Leg).
Among my favourite students I encountered in Hong Kong as a visiting university lecturer in journalism, was a set of cute triplets named Faith, Hope and Charisma.
There was also a schoolmate named Harry Balls, who we wickedly nicknamed Rambuttan. If you are the type who fancies going by your first name initials, do so by all means. But be warned that fame, or possibly notoriety, is often known to have followed many an intriguing name or suggestive credential. You have to have vision before tagging on initials that may prove inordinately indelicate even in the future.
There was a schoolmate with the initials S. H. G. U. N. Kodipilli who was unkindly nicknamed Shotgun. In a classic son-of- a-gun saga his first born was conferred the dubious appellation of Popgun.
Again for instance, if your first name initials happen to read something such as A. C. you will have no problems for yourself initially, except for being inanely referred to as Air-Con, which when you come to think of it isnt too bad when considering the alternatives. But imagine the predicament your son would have to face when everyone you know begin addressing him as a son-of- an-aircon, or worse still, AC Gey Putha!

Premier lauds progress achieved by Police in crime control
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the Police Service has achieved a great degree of development and progress today and this has enabled it to control crime to a great extent.
Incidence of crime has reduced by leaps and bounds although this factor did not gain much media publicity. Similarly, the tendency for resolving crime has also greatly improved. The police service is performing several duties to maintain law and order and I wish to thank the IGP and his subordinate officers for this, the Premier said addressing a meeting after opening the new police station at Wanathavilluwa, Puttalam on September 29.
The Prime Minister said the government was providing facilities needed by the Police to maintain law and order. The opening of the Wanathaviluwa Police station could be described as one such exercise. The new building costing Rs. 60 million was built in one and a half years.
If there was a deterioration of law and order, attention could not be paid to develop infrastructure,he said.
Proper maintenance of law and order had enabled them to pay attention towards the development of Police infrastructure, the PM added.
He said they had created a separate Ministry to handle the Police Department because they did not want to bring it under the wing of the Defence Ministry. In 2015, they decided to resolve all problems confronting the Police service within five years.
Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara gave a detailed account of the services rendered towards the Police service during the last one and a half years. Similarly a great amount of work was accomplished under the tenure of Minister Sagala Ratnayaka. Ministers John Amaratunge and Tilak Marapana too had contributed towards resolving many problems in the Police service.
The Prime Minister said they were aware that some outstanding problems needed solutions. The onus was on the present Minister to resolve them.
Although recruitments were made, the problem relating to promotions remained unresolved. The problem relating to political victimization was awaiting resolution. When problems heap up, it was their duty to resolve them systematically. Enactment of new laws and regulations relating to the police service was also being attended to by the Ministry, the Premier said.
While this is being done under Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara he had to pay attention towards the development of the Moneragala district which was a most undeveloped area, the Prime Minister said.
He should be thanked for all this work. Similarly, State Minister Nalin Bandara was conducting an awareness campaign about the services rendered by the Police.
State Minister Palitha Range Bandara was also working with dedication and self sacrifice to render service to the people in his area. Earlier Anamaduwa had been an undeveloped area. State Minister Range Bandara was striving hard to bring the northern part of the Puttalam district on par with its Southern part through development and progress.
Parliamentarian Hector Appuhamy was working in co-operation with people of all communities and religions to develop his electorate through tourism and infrastructure development, the Prime Minister said.
The Premier said Hector Appuhamy had been pressing him to obtain funds needed for development work.
The government had accelerated development by introducing the Gamperaliya and Enterprise Sri Lanka programmes. Local Government members too had been provided with funds for development in addition to the decentralised Budget funds. The Highways Ministry too had been given funds to build road networks. All this was being done to develop the rural economy, the Prime Minister added.
Although the government was steering through a difficult period caused by the world economic crisis, it would never allow the rural economy to crash, the Premier stressed.

A prudent move
The Government has announced more drastic measures to contain the fall of the Rupee. This was inevitable given the rapid outflow of foreign exchange for certain big ticket items including vehicles. Statistics show that almost US$ 800 million has flowed out for vehicle purchases in a matter of months, while the fuel import bill has also shown a considerable increase. This is par for the course, since nearly 40,000 cars have been registered in the new CBA-led number series alone.
Among the measures announced are a mandatory 200 percent cash margin on Letters of Credit opened for importing vehicles (other than commercial vehicles) and a 100 percent margin on several other items including televisions, speakers, mobile phones, perfumes and footwear. There will be no immediate impact from these measures in the retail market as at least 20,000 vehicles are available at car sales around the country and ample stocks of the other items subject to restrictions are also available.
But the biggest measure is also the most important and perhaps the most overdue: the stoppage of duty/tax free vehicles permits for MPs (for one year) and public servants (six months). It is common knowledge that the vehicle permit system is widely and openly abused by both politicians and public servants  there are plenty of Permits for Sale and Permits Wanted advertisements in Sunday newspapers. Some of the high-value permits for vehicles having a CIF value of US$ 55,000 (Rs.9,350,000 Approx) change hands for twice that amount or more. The result is a huge loss to the economy as the tax net is cheated twice  once when the permit is sold and again when the vehicle is actually imported. Moreover, the clearance fee for these vehicles is a laughable Rs.1,750.
One cannot also fathom why our politicians need luxury vehicles ostensibly to serve the public. Do they really need a Toyota Land Cruiser Sahara V8 or a Mercedes Benz GLS to serve their constituents Granted, there is some rough terrain to traverse for some MPs, but there is nothing that a double cab pickup truck cannot handle. And the price of even a fully duty paid (not duty free) double cab is around Rs.10 million versus a luxury vehicle that costs at least three times more. Sri Lanka is the only country where politicians travel in super luxury vehicles. Scrapping permits is not enough - laws should be brought in to ensure that politicians cannot purchase luxury vehicles at all, unless they do so with their own, verifiable sources of income after paying the duties and taxes in full.
The permits not only result in a huge loss of income to the Customs but also create an imbalance in the vehicle market. The time has indeed come to scrap the vehicle permits for all time  there is no reason why politicians and public servants deserve duty concessions over other sectors. Frankly, there are many people in the private sector and SME sector who make a similar, if not bigger, contribution to the economy, without getting any benefits in return. We should also mention our expatriates, who toil hard for years in foreign lands and get only a paltry US$ 1,750 duty free allowance for buying white goods. If there is any sector that deserves duty concessionary permits, it is the expat workers.
What we need is a rational duty structure that applies equally to everyone across the board for importing motor vehicles. There should be no duty free facilities for passenger vehicles for anyone, period. A viable duty structure should be in force at least for the next five years. What happens now is that once a particular category (say, 1,000 CC) gets a duty cut, there is a frenzy to import such vehicles. This is exactly why the vehicle import bill went up so drastically recently, as more than 90 percent of the vehicles imported were from the 1,000 CC category. On the other hand, if the duties are distributed more evenly and progressively throughout the different engine capacities, there will be no mad rush to import vehicles from one particular category.
But there is one area of concern  electric vehicles. The Government should revert to giving tax and duty breaks for all-electric vehicles, which are now going mainstream. All major manufacturers have already or will soon be introducing pure electric vehicles and some manufacturers will only have an electric line-up by 2025. This should tally with the Governments plans to electrify the Government fleet by that year and ensure that no fossil fuel vehicles are registered after 2040. Restrictions on pure electric vehicles could slow down this momentum. While giving concessions for electrics, the Government must also ensure that the national grid is not used to charge electric vehicles. This can be done by encouraging the installation of solar-powered car chargers, which too can be given duty-free status.
The car is an aspiration and a democracy is all about choice. We hope that the Budget 2019 will contain a more viable vehicle duty structure that balances the publics mobility aspirations and the Governments revenue imperatives.

RANJITH FERNANDO
He has always been a cheerful character since I have seen him for donkeys years, as a cricketer at school, club or International level, as a prestigious commentator or as an administrator Ranjith Fernandos hallmark is he is friendly. He has worn many hats in Sri Lanka cricket and this church going guy has many friends in all walks of life and hardly any enemies.
As soon as I stepped in to his residence at Elibank Road, he put me at ease with a glass of ice coffee. He is still a typical Kotahena guy who is proud of his roots. Ranjith stressed the fact that Kotahena has a unique character of its own in the sense that there are no ethnic, religious or class barriers. Ranjith reminisced that he lived down Pansal Mawatha amidst two Buddhist temples and he was in amicable terms with those priests there. He mused that there were famous Hindu kovils and numerous churches of all denominations dotted throughout Kotahena.
Going down memory lane Ranjith said that in Kotahena there are two big schools for boys and girls, namely St Benedicts and Good Shepherd Convent. Hence the opportunities were available both for sport and education in close proximity. Little Ranjith always had a penchant for cricket and played softball cricket for many a small club and one was called Sin-tam-berg, meaning Sinhalese, Tamils and Burghers. This was run by a doctor who is now domiciled in New Zealand.
Ranjith was so talented that at one stage the late great Harold de Andrado tried to hijack him to St Josephs but his father intervened and he stuck to St Benedicts and played first XI cricket at the tender age of 15. He was a swashbuckling opening bat and an agile wicketkeeper to boot. Ranjiths deeds at school were quickly spotted and he was selected to play for Ceylon whilst still at school. They paid a lot of attention to physical fitness then. They started at 6 a.m. in the morning and Ranjith used to catch the first bus to leave from Kotahena to the Torrington Square and they had to jog till about 9 a.m. Then take a quick shower at the SSC or the NCC and back to work at Mackwoods where he was a trainee tea taster. Ranjith related an interesting incident. Lionel Fernando who was a brilliant batsman was also in the squad and he used to set off at 4.30 in the morning from Negombo in his Fiat 600 to be there on time.
Ranjith was selected to tour under the captaincy of Yatagama Amaradasa to Pakistan. Ranjith recalled that T.B. Kehelgamuwa was a terror on that tour and they won all their matches due to his pace bowling.
Ranjith, Tennekoon and David Heyn were earmarked by the higher ups as the future of Sri Lanka cricket but due to various interferences it was not to be and David Heyn was badly affected and he got so cut up that he left our shores to showcase his talents in Old Blighty.
Those days prior to becoming a Test playing nation tours and international matches were few and far between. Ranjith also had to play under the shadow of Dr Herbert I. K. Fernando a brilliant wicket keeper and a superb batsman.
Ranjith emphasised the fact that the team then was up to Test standard and if that aborted tour went ahead we would have got the Test status in the sixties. He pointed out that financing would have being provided by Robert Senanayake and a few corporate giants of that day. Ranjith regrets that due to lack of exposure they were held back and were in the wilderness for 20 years or so till late Minister Gamini Dissanayake broke the shackles.
Ranjith was selected as the manager of the Sri Lankan cricket team on several occasions. Rewinding back he stated that he enjoyed his tenure then. He has always been a part and parcel of the Sri Lankan cricket set up till he started his career as a prestigious commentator in the company off late Tony Greig (personal friend then), Richie Benaud, Ian Chappell, Sunny Gavaskar and the jolly Henry Blofeld.
I noted that Ranjiths English was crisp and eloquent. These gifts would have stood him in good stead. However it was not Ranjiths piece of cake, although it was a prestigious occupation he felt bored and lonely being stuck to a hotel room in his off days and in strange surroundings and people. This he analysed and informed me that he is a team man and when playing and managing he was more at home. As a commentator you have a huge audience and you have to be on the ball which Ranjith cherished but the off days he mentioned again that they were dull and lonesome.
When Ranjith represented his country at cricket, we never heard of match fixing, pitch fixing or any other deviations from the true spirit of cricket. Ranjith tactfully avoided commenting on the pet hate -------, in short that was typical of respectable Ranjith Fernando.

Rashid Khan jumps to No.1 in ODI all-rounders rankings
After his excellent performance at the Asia Cup 2018, Afghanistan spin sensation Rashid Khan has become the No.1-ranked all-rounder in one-day internationals.
Rashid was sensational with the ball, and did well with the bat in the Asia Cup. He topped the bowling charts, picking up 10 wickets from five matches, and also scored 87 runs at an average of 43.50.
Afghanistan were outstanding, beating Sri Lanka and Bangladesh in the group stage and then losing to Pakistan and Bangladesh in last-over finishes in the Super Fours before tying their game against India.
For his efforts in Dubai and Sharjah, Khan has gained six slots and earned 67 points, which put him on top of the MRF Tyres ICC ODI All-Rounder Rankings, toppling Bangladesh's Shakib Al Hasan. Rashid's teammate Mohammad Nabi also gained one slot to reach the third position after aggregating 134 runs and taking five wickets.
In the bowlers list, Rashid has retained his No.2 spot, while 17-year-old spinner Mujeeb Ur Rahman has moved up 15 places to take the eighth place after finishing with seven wickets in the Asia Cup. Nabi, meanwhile has gained two slots to reach the 15th position.
Nabi has also risen in the batting rankings, up to No.53rd after gaining 13 points, while Khan is up by 21 slots and is now sitting in the 97th position. Afghanistan's most impressive batsmen in the tournament, Hashmatullah Shahidi and Mohammad Shahzad, also made significant gains in the rankings.
Shahidi, who totalled 263 runs from five innings, moved up 64 spots to joint 91st with New Zealand's Jimmy Neesham, while Shahzad beefed up his tally with a blazing 124 in the game against India, and moved up 19 places to No.36, joint with Scotland's Calum MacLeod and Sri Lanka's Niroshan Dickwella.
The other man to stand out in the batting rankings was Liton Das, the Bangladesh opener who smashed 121 in the final. He rose a remarkable 107 spots to a career-best No.116.
Among the other high performers from the tournament to gain were Rohit Sharma (up two spots to No.2), Shikhar Dhawan (up by four to No.5), Mushfiqur Rahim (up six to No.16), Imam-ul-Haq (up 15 to No.27), Shoaib Malik (up 12 to No.42) and Hong Kong captain Anshuman Rath, who moved up 15 places and finished at 55th position.

Right to Peace
In todays Sri Lankan context peace process and the role of peace is predominant. The three-decade-long armed conflict in Sri Lanka ended in May 2009. Some people are under an illusion thinking that we achieved peace by winning the war. We have to question ourselves whether everyone is happy with the situation. Not really. The war ended leaving behind several casualties, dead bodies, trauma, destruction of public utilities and civilian properties, and innumerable human rights violations.
An absence of war or armed conflict in and of itself does not automatically lead to peace and reconciliation. It has been a decade after finishing the war. For a decade what have we achieved in the peace journey What initiatives has the government taken What you, as an individual, have done More than anything else, as the young generation who owns the future of this country, what have we done Scars and wounds are there and what have we truly done as a nation to heal those bleeding wounds
Peace is a demand in the current world context. Peace is when people are able to resolve their conflicts without violence and can work together to improve the quality of life. The World Peace Day fell on September 21 under the theme Right to Peace. Declaration on the right of peoples to peace has been approved by General Assembly Resolution 39/22 of November 12, 1984. There it is being recognized that the maintenance of a peaceful life for peoples is the sacred duty of each State.
Peace, human rights and development
At present, there are mainly two types of interpretation of the meaning of peace-negative peace and positive peace. Negative peace refers to the absence of violence (i.e. the violence stopped, oppression ended). A modern example would be North and South Korea. Positive peace refers to the absence of indirect and structural violence. Here it is visible, restoration of relationships and having a social system that whole population respect and recognise. Over the past decade what we saw in Sri Lanka was negative peace. The three UN pillars of the right to peace namely peace, human rights and development are closely connected.
Needless to say, seeing and experiencing or committing violence and injustice every day, for long years of our life, it will take an untold toll on our humanity. Moreover, due to complications in the economy, politics, freedom, unemployment, education, ethnicity, lack of opportunities etc, youth in Sri Lanka is connected to anxiety and hardship in post-independence Sri Lanka. Consequently, two main insurrections occurred in 1971 and 1987 - 1989, identified as economic-politicized. Subsequently, the third one, which was Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) insurrection in 1983-2009 was ethnic-politicized and dragged this country to a miserable condition.
We have a long journey to go in order to achieve sustainable peace. According to Fedenico Mayor, former Director General of the UNESCO, Instead of absence of war, peace is increasingly seen as a dynamic, participative, long-term process, based on universal values and everyday practice, at all levels the family, the school, the community as well as the nation(Serto, 2003). Reconciliation is the only path to achieve peace effectively.
Reconciliation process
Reconciliation is defined by its Hebrew root word Tikuum Olam which means a three-part process of HEAL, REPAIR and TRANSFORM. It is high time we concentrated on the reconciliation process as it has not been properly addressed and processed through every part of the country. The longer the society remains segregated and communities live apart from each other, the deeper the hatred and greater the chance for animosity to continue. History has proven that grievances ignored will eventually destroy the potential for a sustainable peace.
Transforming war into peace is a long-term process. This process is not a goal or an event. It is a lifestyle and attitude-changing. As Sri Lankans, we are blessed to see a ray of hope for positive peace in recent past.
Fortunately, a semblance of peace has returned to Sri Lanka. In 2015, the Government of Sri Lanka renewed its commitment to reconciliation and thereafter embarked on several initiatives for national reconciliation. In contemporary Sri Lankan context, sparks of positive peace are arising. It is a light of a hope and a green light for youth to have a bright future. Correspondingly there are new entities being established to secure the peace process such as Secretariat for Coordinating Reconciliation Mechanisms (SCRM). On June 24, 2016, Right to Information Act was passed with the Right to Information Commission being established. It enables:
(i) The public to access to information, (ii) Responsibility of state institutions to publish information, (iii) Responsibility to release information.
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) was set up in January 2015 and they have initiated a number of programmes focusing on art and culture, psychosocial perspectives, religion and education. Furthermore, on September 21, 2015, the National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry was established. They take action on development projects. Government is strengthening the peace process. It may be slow but a steady process. Context peace is understood as a dynamic process, not an absolute end point.
The then Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera has asked for more time from UNHRC with the peace process in 2017. Yes, it is not an overnight task. Office on Missing Persons was established in February 2018 as an independent entity. The Government is working towards Office for Reparations and the Bill was gazetted on June 25 and submitted to parliament on July 17. It is about the light of faith, hope and justice. Also, SCRM has launched an awareness-raising campaign for reconciliation titled Ahanna (listen) launched on August 8, 2018. Ahanna programme reaching out to the public in a very effective manner. The campaign travelled across the island, visiting 41 towns (so far) as a street-theatre performance, promoting social cohesion and communal harmony with the aim of bringing together communities by sharing among them a collective of personal stories as a creative initiative that fosters unity and reconciliation. There are positive peace activities being carried out recently by the government. This process of reconciliation should be appreciated, acknowledged and recognized.
Legitimate mechanism
Most importantly, the establishment of transitional justice in Sri Lanka is a huge step in the process of reconciliation. To achieve sustainable peace and reconciliation transitional justice is important to address past abuses in a proper manner with the legitimate mechanism. Looking at the other countries where transitional justice being processed such as Latin America and later South Africa, Yugoslavia, Chilli, Brazil, Canada and Indonesia, it is intelligible and we should understand that it takes time to proceed.
Peace researcher and former Australian Ambassador John W. Burton argues that peace does not mean the absence of conflict. Looking at recent abrupt racial conflicts, Sri Lanka is still very much divided along ethnic lines. There was a considerable amount of international dissatisfaction with the slow pace of progress due to the long delay in setting up the reconciliation mechanisms such as the Office on Missing Persons, Office for Reparations, Truth and Reconciliation Commission and Special Judicial Mechanism.
Sri Lanka is a developing country dealing with a post-conflict strained society. Reconciliation is not only important to achieve a peaceful society. It will also have an impact on our society in numerous ways. The civil war lasted over 25 years produced a political fragmentation, deep ethnic division and weak economy. Pluralistic nature in Sri Lanka is challenging, yet it is the Sri Lankans responsibility to take it as strength. Reconciliation, peace-building and transformation of the politics and economy are essential for Sri Lanka to heal.
Non-recurrence is important. Every individual in this society should work towards peace. Teenagers to youngsters and youngsters to adults, we all should bear the responsibility with regard to peace, not the mere government. Us, the younger generation carries the main responsibility in the peace process in Sri Lanka. Therefore, we can be the generation to change the negative peace into the positive peace. State of peace is beneficial to individuals, states, nations and for all mankind and it is everyones right - P E A C E.
There never was a good war or a bad peace - Benjamin Franklin

Rohit Sharma upto no. 2 in ODI rankings
Rohit Sharma, who led India to their seventh Asia Cup triumph last week, has gained two spots in the rankings for one-day international batsmen.
The Indian opener is now at No.2 on the MRF Tyres ICC ODI Rankings for Batsmen, only behind his captain Virat Kohli on the list. The right-hander scored 317 runs in five innings in the competition, scoring one century and two half-centuries for a batting average of 105.66.
His opening partner, Shikhar Dhawan, also took giant strides on the list, climbing four spots to sit at No.5. The left-hander was the leading scorer in the tournament, accumulating 342 runs in five innings with two centuries to his name.
Elsewhere, Jasprit Bumrah retained his spot at the summit of rankings for bowlers. The pacer was in brilliant form throughout the Asia Cup, especially in the death overs, where he did not concede a single boundary in more than nine overs.
With eight wickets in four games, he was the fourth-leading wicket-taker of the tournament. Rashid Khan, who picked up the most wickets in the competition, moved up to No.1 in the all-rounders list and held on to his spot behind Bumrah among the bowlers.
With 10 wickets in six games, Kuldeep Yadav climbed three spots to sit at No.3 on the list, his best-ever rank with his career-best points  700.
The other Indian to make massive gains after the triumphant campaign in Dubai and Abu Dhabi was Ravindra Jadeja, who marked his comeback to the ODI team with seven wickets for not too many in four outings.
He moved up 14 places to No.39.

Satire spy sequel
If you enjoyed 2003s Johnny English and 2011s Johnny English Reborn then the third installment in the series Johnny English Strikes Again will be a treat for you. Rowan Atkinson of Mr Bean fame brings on a lot of laugher and an engaging plot in his latest adventure.
Accompanied by his trusty sidekick Bough, Atkinson goes on a hunt to find a high-tech villain who has obtained a full list of intelligences undercover spies, leaving the MI7 with no option but to turn to the retirees. Thus English is yanked out of retirement where he plays the role of a teacher to a pack of children who are eager for adventure.
The biggest plus point in the film is that it is sans the stereotype comic gags. There are no slapstick comedy but scenes and lines which involve out of the box comedy. Though there is nothing unique in the plot Atkinson manages to keep the audience glued to their seats because of his magnetic acting skills.
Most of the action scenes in the film remind us of other detective and action related films like the Mission Impossible series and Skyfall. Another sector in which the film has failed is in its villain. Rampages Jake Lacy makes the unlikeliest of villains and it is clear that he has been roped in to give the villain a comic appeal rather than make it a serious production. Many more scenes like the one in which the spy duo burn down an outdoor diner while trying to get information from a phone is aimed at making the audience roll in their seats with laughter.
The heroine pf the film, Olga Kurylenko who plays Ophelias character, does not have much screen time but manages to make a significant mark in the plot. Ben Miller too is overshadowed by Atkinson but still earns a few laughs by playing his part well.
The pace is brisk, the jokes make up for in quantity what they lack in quality and the film never resorts to sleaze or meanness to earn its laughs. So knock yourself out when you hit the theaters as everyones favourite dedicative gets back in action.

Shoes  to match  hair
Singer Sia has teamed up with French ballet brand Repetto on a new capsule collection that matches her iconic hair.
The Chandelier pop star fused her signature strands into three styles for the dance shoe label, including a ballerina flat, dance slipper and oxford shoe, with each pair featuring a small replica of the large bow she ties into her onstage hairstyles.
According to a press release announcing the unique collaboration, which serves as Sias debut fashion venture, the range was designed to capture the spirit of everyone who lives to their own beat. Movement, dance, style and freedom are values shared by both, uniting this partnership.
Part of the theme of the pieces captures Sias personal motto, I love you, keep going.
There are currently three Sophia style ballerina flats from Sias new collection available for preorder on Repettos website - one is all black while the other two pairs are two-toned in black and white. The ballerina shoes retail for $195 (150) apiece.
Fans can purchase the rest of Sias capsule collection items with Repetto when the full range officially becomes available on 25 February next year (19).
Choosing a dance shoe company as her first ever collaborative fashion partner isnt a surprise for many of her fans - Sia has often incorporated theatrical dance performances in her videos, helping to launching 15-year-old dancer Maddie Zieglers career.
The teenager, who often appears to be a young Sia in music promos, featured in the videos for the Australian stars hits Chandelier and Elastic Heart.

Sri Lanka launches first social impact funds
Two memoranda of understanding were signed in New York, launching Sri Lankas first social impact funds aimed at supporting social entrepreneurs access innovative financing, to help achieve the 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
The signings were witnessed by Tilak Marapana, Minister of Foreign Affairs, Achim Steiner, UNDP Administrator, at a special side event, at the 73rd session of the United Nations General Assembly.
The two MoUs - one for a US$ 5 million Social Enterprise Fund (SEF) and one for a US$ 20 million Social Impact Capital Fund (SICF) were signed by Chandula Abeywickrema, Deshan Pushparajah respectively, and by Haoliang Xu, Assistant Administrator and Director of UNDPs Regional Bureau for Asia and Pacific.
The Sustainable Development Goals are aimed at ending poverty, protecting the planet and ensuring peace and prosperity for all, by 2030. Achieving the goals however, will require a massive amount of resources. The United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates the sustainable development goals will cost between US$5 - US$7 trillion, with a funding gap of about US$2.5 trillion in developing countries.
Given these global and national pressures on funding, Sri Lanka is keen to explore alternative and innovative means of financing, particularly by leveraging the private sector, to help meet the SDGs. Given that micro, small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) form the backbone of the Sri Lankan economy, and the countrys growing awareness and interest in impact investing and social entrepreneurship, impact funds were identified as a means of mobilizing funding for the SDGs in Sri Lanka.
In order to address this, the Lanka Impact Investing Network and Tempest P E Partners (a member of the Capital Alliance Group), in collaboration with UNDP, pioneered Sri Lankas first social impact funds.
UNDP is committed to helping countries to achieve the SDGS. These social impact funds will play a key role in that mission, by supporting social entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka, said Haoliang Xu, UN Assistant Secretary-General, and Director of UNDPs Regional Bureau for Asia and the Pacific. Together with the establishment of the funds, UNDP is committed to supporting Sri Lanka further leverage innovating financing models to realize the vision of a sustainable future by 2030.
The Social Enterprise Fund (SEF) will cater mostly to successfully incubated, commercially viable, micro and small social enterprises with capital requirements of less than USD 100,000. In addition to capital, the fund will also provide targeted technical and capacity development support through mentorship, business support and training. The Social Impact Capital Fund (SICF) will support inclusive and responsible businesses that integrate and promote social impact, as a part of their business models. The SICFs investments will be larger, in excess of USD 100,000. UNDP will be responsible for impact measurement and management of the projects for both funds, to ensure they are well aligned with the SDGs and achieve significant social impact.
Founder and Chairman of Lanka Impact Investing Network, Chandula Abeywickrema said, Lanka Impact Investing Network (LIIN) has taken a number of pioneering initiatives to create a social entrepreneurship ecosystem and to build the impact investing landscape in Sri Lanka to drive the culture of entrepreneurship.
The Chief Executive Officer of Capital Alliance Group, Ajith Fernando added, We are pleased to be partnering with Lanka Impact Investing Network and UNDP in this timely push to develop an impact investment franchise. We are strong believers that given an enabling environment, sustainable & profitable solutions for the social problems of our day can and will come from the private sector.

STEPS TO RESTRICT INTERNET ACCESS FOR CHILDREN
The government has taken the initiative to draw up a mechanism to control and manage Internet access for children, Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara yesterday said.
Accordingly, the government is to design a programme by next year to secure children from improper access to the internet, she said.
Pointing out that children are prone to various kinds of cyber-violations, Minister Bandara further said that the government is holding a series of discussions with the relevant stakeholders with reference to the matter. The Minister also observed that in certain countries, social media apps such as Facebook are completely blocked.
Nowadays, it is not enough to keep our children at home and think that they are safe. They can come to harm even behind closed doors of their own rooms. Therefore, the parents always need to stay vigilant of these instances.
It is important that we make sure the students can access the internet only for educative purposes, the Minister pointed out.
Minister Bandara was speaking at the National Ceremony celebrating World Childrens Day, held at Temple Trees yesterday under the patronage of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
A Stamp and a First Day Cover commemorating World Childrens Day was issued at the ceremony with the participation of Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, Minister Chandrani Bandara and the Post Master General. Certificates were awarded by the Premier to nine students who have shown exceptional talents in their respective subject areas. A special award was presented to the student who contributed to the art work of the Stamp and the First Day Cover as well.
The World Bank, for the first time, has come forward to support an Asian country in the Early Childhood Development process by facilitating Sri Lanka, Minister Bandara also said.
Accordingly, the World Bank is assisting us in developing pre-schools, training pre-school teachers, providing free food for day care centers and establishing government administrated day care centers.
These day care centers will not be limited for young children but also to others who need security and care, the Minister said. Minister Bandara also pointed out that in 2017, around 4,000 children had been abused whereas 956 acts of violence against children have been reported. One hundred and twelve cases of those were child laborers, 117 sexual abuse cases and 602 violations of child rights. The Ministry of Women and Child Affairs, aligning existing national trends related to children with international tendencies, has declared Strengthen Our Children to go forth with Courage as this years theme for World Childrens Day.

Subjects for GCE (O/L) exam reduced
The government has also taken a decision to lower the number of subjects that students have to sit for in the Ordinary Level Examination, Women and Child Affairs Minister Chandrani Bandara said.
She pointed out that the decision has been taken by the Ministry of Education. It was also said that the Education Ministry is considering the possibility of lowering the number of subjects down to six.
The children are dragged to a number of private tuition classes from Grade One. They have no freedom at all. When we were children, we never went for tuition classes. Now the competition has incessantly increased, robbing the children of their childhood. The children are not looked at as individual beings. The parents keep comparing their child to other children. All these bring too much stress on these kids. It is important that we as adults to identify the potentials and skills of their children and motivate them to achieve their goals, the Minister pointed out.

Is there a Modern Prince
Glancing through the business columns of a newspaper I found a revelation: 100,000 acres of land -30,000 in the North and 70,000 in the East- owned by the Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation are being occupied by the Army. The failure to transfer the land to the owners even 10 years after the end of the war shows the negligence of the authorities and their indifference to national development. The land remains unutilized productively. If this is the situation with regard to land belonging to a State Corporation one could imagine the lethargy and indifference that could exist in the case of transfer of private land to their legitimate owners.
Negligence is not limited to a particular sector of the economy or a particular field of activity. It is much more prevailing. Neglect of and insensitivity to human suffering is most callous. Many victimized families of landslides and other natural calamities are still in make-shift dwellings without houses, including those of Samasarakanda in Aranayake, whose misfortune shocked the entire country.
disorder and disarray
There is a local like adage which says like a bull goring a man who fell from a tree (gahen vetuna minihata gona anna vage). Similarly, negligence is often accompanied by disorder and disarray. In the context of increasing vulnerability of the country to natural disasters there is no unified approach to disaster management. As was noted recently in a study, there are 111 ministries that run 35 programmes on disaster management without any coordination among them. Also disturbing is the reluctance of the authorities to provide long-term and more sustainable disaster prevention measures and their preference to short-term and hurried temporary solutions in view of impending elections. The Nilwala Ganga development project is a case in point. Not only were long term plans, including the one that proposed integrated development of Kalu, Gin and Nilwala basins were abandoned, worse still even the implemented project was stopped half-way. A canal to drain excess flood waters in Matara still remain to be constructed with the result that the Matara town gets periodically inundated by flood waters.
Funds earmarked for capital expenses often remain under-utilized or unutilized and are returned to the treasury. The same happens with foreign investments at the year-end, resulting in interest being paid for such unutilized amounts. Allocations for social infrastructure development often gets misused for other expenses, the distribution of sil redi by utilizing Samurdhi funds being an example that attracted much public attention.
Bypassing environmental assessments for political expediency or subverting the assessment procedures by resorting to corruption are common. They arise fundamentally from indifference of the authorities to the plight of the people, especially the poor and marginalized. The tragic consequences of the Uma Oya Development Project which dispossessed land and water for thousands of people and ruined agriculture are well-known.
social infrastructure
Immense is the degradation of social infrastructure. For example, the whole system of University education is in a crisis. Universities are deprived of funds, human and physical resources and is plagued by maladministration.
No wonder our Universities have failed to reach a creditable place in the world University ranking.
Though we boast of providing free education from the Kindergarten to the University more than 50 percent of the cost of education falls on the shoulders of parents. Pre-school education is entirely in the hands of mudalalis and incompetent teachers. An unregulated private school network has grown over the years and its cumulative effect has not been studied or recorded.
In the health sector a vibrant private health service has grown alongside the State health service. The former depends largely on the human resources of the latter. Meanwhile, the State hospitals, especially in the outstations suffer from manifold shortages and deficiencies.
Public transport is woefully inadequate. The inadequacy of public transport has resulted in a massive influx of private vehicles on the roads and caused huge discomforts to the commuters. Escalating fuel prices and strong-arm tactics of private omnibus owners have jacked up transport fares to unbearable levels. Roads and highways are becoming death-traps and the number of traffic accidents, including fatal ones is on the rise.
The Government has done away with planning. It has not appointed the Planning Commission and dismantled the planning infrastructure. The economy is drifting like a rudderless ship.
The Police Commission and the IGP are at loggerheads. Now even conspiracy charges are levelled against senior police officers. Laws delays are proverbial. Justice delayed is justice denied.
Forces of communalism and ethno-religious fundamentalism are aggressively threatening the unity and cohesion of the social fabric, unfortunately with no opposition from the Government which prefers to flirt with them.
This is the situation we face today. Quo vadis Sri Lanka
Could this situation be tolerated Who could show a way forward
Is there a Saviour around Or a Gramscian Modern Prince Unlikely. 2020 is not going to solve anything. The danger of unrest looms.
Can we escape by running away to foreign lands No, though a few would succeed.
Then we have to stay and fight to avert the danger. How Thats the question!
This column expresses its confidence that sooner or later the progressive forces in the Sri Lankan society would eschew opportunism and sectarianism and merge into a formidable social force capable of chartering an independent path of development that would be democratic and just. Let all men and women of good will work towards that end!

Uniquely United in MUSIC
Billa is the latest groovy song that you cant help but get you moving. Just released one week ago this groovy punchy song is by Centigradz, a music band well loved by local and international fans. We met them at their studio where most of the magic happen to find out how this tale of music unfolded.
We released the song `Billa just a weekago and have had a great feedback. We got air play on main radio stations and the song is on social media and you tube. We did this song after one and half years and fans have been demanding a song from us. We thought this time we will give them something to dance thus we composed this upbeat, groovy song to make them move. The lyrics of the song are by Ranuka Jeewantha and music is by Thusith Niroshana, Amila Niroshan who is managing the bands schedules and the main RAP artist said.
According to Amila this journey of lifting the spirits of people up and making them happy with their songs and their magical sounds has begun almost fifteen years ago. When a few college boys of St Johns College Nugegoda - Amila, Udaya, Isuru, Ishan and Thusith crossed the paths and formed a band, they never thought the band will be where they are today.
We merely followed our passion and the common dream of making unique music. We got invited from several schools to perform. We got some good feed backs from our audiences and we continued our passion and here we are today loved by our fans and followers, Amila reminisced.
Technical side
The journey since then has been smooth, slow and steady for Centigradz. Today the four Centigradz members Ishan, Eranga, Thusith and Amila together with numerous others behind the scene do wonders with notes and sounds. Apart from singing as a band they also perform at corporate events, weddings and other functions.
Centigradz also take up in house productions for commercials and trailers while running a school for music production. Anyone can join this school and follow a short course on digital composing. They can learn the basics which will enable them to be professionals and project themselves to take up production. Music is not just singing but a person has to be well versed with technical side of it too. Today most of the youngsters entering the field do not know the international artists or Sri Lankan folk music thus their journey is short, Thusith Niroshana who is handles several aspects including the music production and composing voiced.
If you want to be professional in the field of music you have to know what you are doing and have to get your basics correct. In our country at present there is lot of exposure.
Professional music
There are companies that will bring you to lime light, write songs for you compose music but after sometime when you are on your own if you dont know the basics you have no place to go. The society is changing and trend is changing rapidly so you really have to work hard to be in the field, says Amila. Making music the right way, the band has to its name many awards and accolades. From winning the international award `Excellent New Singer Award at Asia Pacific World Star Quest in Penang Malaysia in 2008 to local accolades Centigradz have excelled in professional music industry in Sri Lanka inspiring the young music lovers. The vocals in present songs are amazing there is lot of talent out there but the Sri Lankan touch is missing. The best example is K-pop (abbreviation of Korean pop) which is characterized by a wide variety of audiovisual elements. It is a modern form of South Korean pop that is influenced by styles and genres from around the world, such as Western pop music, rock, experimental, jazz, gospel, Latin, hip hop, R&B, reggae, electronic dance, folk, country, classical, and Europop on top of its uniquely traditional Korean music roots. This has taken the world by storm, Amila explains.
He points out that this is what Sri Lanka needs to do as well. We have to break through this to the international level. There are no agencies to represent the music bands here.
We need a systematic support - financially theoretically and funding to take our music and talents to the world, Amila added. Pawan De Silva, Digital Audio Engineer and music composer joined in to add that Sri Lankan music is not connected enough to the world.
It needs just one break through to take the amazing talents here globally. The talent and creativity we see today can match any international act, Pawan said. He raises concerns on the issues youngsters face in entering the music field. It takes a lot of effort to start a career in the field. There are lots of talented people but the support is missing. As there is a huge competition talented people are not given the opportunity. I believe that an artist cannot be framed. The talent one possesses cannot be taken away. The creativity of each person varies as music is a product. No one can steal your talent but you got to be patient to gain the necessary experience to reach the top. You have to have the originality in your work, Pawan explained.
Negative message
We learn every day from music. Music also has an impact on the society. If we take the recent suicide rates more males died by suicide than the females. If you look at the songs that were released recently most of them had this negative message. The audience should be wise in selecting what they are listening to, he advised. All band members are grateful to their fans in Sri Lanka and around the world. Our main fans are Sri Lankan. We have a fan base internationally in Europe, Australia, Japan and with the song we did for the world cup cricket we got our selves introduced to countries like India and Bangladesh.
We will continue our journey making people happy. We are doing what we like doing the most and will create positive vibes for our people, members said.
The band is excited in touring Italy soon to sing at the Sri Lanka Italy beauty pageant for the fourth time and Daily News wishes them all success.

Where Love has  no Boundaries
Long before I see them, I hear them. The Namel Malini Punchi Theatre is curiously empty this Saturday afternoon. The golden hued walls, the ever familiar masks giving me their friendly smiles, the lush green foliage all around me seem to be surrounded by a sense of mystery today.
The door to the auditorium is open. I peep in and realize there is no one there either. Then I hear it...the delicate sweet song of a woman, a short musical interlude, followed by a rich, deep baritone. The mesmerizing sound seems to come from above me, from the realms of the gods. It feels as though I am eavesdropping on a celestial performance held in the skies.
When Malini Weeramuni comes towards me, wraps me in a warm embrace and takes me upstairs, I realize I am not far wrong. Yes, the gods and goddesses are singing: Rama, the incarnation of Vishnu, is taking a walk with Sita, the avatar of goddess Lakshmi. The next minute he stops in mid-stride. So does the music. All heads turn towards me  the mere mortal writer among a crowd of angels and yes, demons!
With burning cheeks, I walk across the floor to make my way to Namel Weeramuni who is directing his latest play seated on a chair at the far corner of the hall. Behind him are the other performers and the orchestra led by the veteran musicians Jayantha Aravinda and Lionel Goonetilleke. I kick myself for disrupting the scene unfolding between Sita and Rama with my undramatic entrance. But to my relief, everyone welcomes me into their midst with warm greetings and soon the rehearsals continue: Rama and Sita dance their way through the forest of Panchavati. Their movements graceful, their voices blending in perfect harmony. Here then is the epitome of perfect love.
Before the next act begins Namel Weeramuni turns to me. The part you just saw is written by Prof. J.B Disanayaka, he explains. Then he gives me a printout of another script and smiles. This is the last part of the play. The last part is written by me. So, this play, Ravana Seethabilashaya has a collaborative script written by Prof. JB and me.
Demon king
While Professor Disanayakas masterpiece written when he was still a student, vividly and brilliantly brings to life the story all of us know as the Ramayana, regarded as the greatest of all devotional Hindu epics, Namel Weeramuni in the last scenes of the play gives a twist to the story, portraying Ravana, the King of Lanka in a new light  a light that brings out the best in this hitherto blackguarded demon king. Needless to say, it takes a brave playwright to rework the epic with the audacity Namel Weeramuni employs. My version of the Ramayana reveals what Valmiki failed to see, says Weeramuni.
The combination of these two well-crafted scripts is brought to life with perfection by Rajitha Hevathanthrige. Tall, lithe, outwardly ruthless, inwardly tender and passionately in love with Sita, Rajithas tough-shelled but empathetic Ravana stirs the heartstrings of not only the audience but that of another protagonist in the play. The identity of this particular character, however, is for me to know and for you to discover when the play goes on the boards of the Punchi Theatre on 4th, 5th, and 6th October, 2018.
Talking about his role as Ravana, Rajtha raises his head high, adopts a royal stance and gives an evil grin. I play the Veddha King in Maname. Im the Lion in Sinhabahu. I thrive on playing the character of the villain. I love being a villain! If not for the sparkle of laughter in his eyes, its easy to end up believing him.
Surangi Kosalas Sita is in some ways the conventional archetype for all Indian and South Asian women, a role model created by a predominantly patriarchal society. Yet, in Ravana Seethabilashaya Sita is also a flesh-and-blood presence, a young woman in distress. Speaking with me during a break, Surangi admits playing the role of Sita was an overwhelming challenge. I wanted to do justice to the character of Sita and I even sought strength from the celestial powers above. Before I started to play this role I paid a visit to the Sita Amma Kovil in Nuwara Eliya. Having already acted in Nattukkari and familiar with the way Namel Weeramuni directs his crew, Surangis rendering of Sita is enough to renew ones faith in the future of the local theatre.
Mythical characters
Along with Chaminda Mirihagalla as Rama, Nihari Somasiri, Nilakshi Halapitiya, Kasuni Ranasinghe who intermittently play the role of Ravanas mother, Saman Liyanarachchi as Lakshman, Guvani Uvindya as Suparnika, Sugath Maithri as Vibhishana, and Amith Prasad as Hanuman the cast of Ravana Seethabilashaya give life to mythical characters in ways we do not ordinarily get to experience in stylized drama. No doubt their performance is enhanced by the choreography of Akila Palipana, the powerful voices of the three narrators: Mahesh Rajaguru who shows signs of another Wijeratne Warakagoda in the making, Nihari Somasiri, Nishantha Ajith Kumara and the chorus: Darshana Perera, Manjula Horawila, Dasun Niranga, Tharanga Dilshan, Ravindu Sandaruvan, Akalanka Welagedera, Devmini Dodangoda, Chamini Shyamali, Kaushi Keshala and Tharushi Shasini as well as the dazzling costumes designed by Jagath Kosmodara and Malini Weeramuni.
As I watch the play unravel I realize the love and camaraderie between the actors, befitting the theme of the play, are as intricately wrought as the gentle transitions from instrumental interludes to sudden, dramatic silences at crucial moments of the play.
Elaborate costumes
Even though Malini Weeramuni who has often been the heroine in a number of plays directed by her husband is not on the stage in Ravana Seethabilashaya, her presence is seen in the elaborate costumes, the picturesque armour and the cheerful, homely atmosphere that prevails on and off the stage. She is, no doubt, as important as the crew, for she is the mother they turn to for comfort and encouragement - she is, mother earth, personified.
Important, too, is this lovely fact: War plays virtually no role in Ravana Seethabilashaya. Because surprise, surprise: Namel Weeramuni does not wish to solve the conflict between Rama and Ravana by making them take up arms against each other. And so, the new saga of the Ramayana ends with hope  hope for humanity, hope for peace and love among all living beings...paving the way for a new kind of hero. To steal a quote from my father who summed up the script so succinctly: Here is a play that proves real heroes are those who prevent a war.
By the time the last chords mingle with the gathering dusk and its time to end the rehearsals I bid farewell to the amazing cast of this amazing play. There is no doubt in my mind that just when there seems nothing new in the land of the lively arts, along comes something unexpected and wholly different. Dramatic coherence, human integrity, irresistible visual power, are all present in this outstanding work I have seen all year.
Catch you at the Punchi Theatre from 4th to6th October 2018, to witness a mesmerizing performance of a familiar text visibly refreshed by being seen from a humanist angle.
You will carry home a message revealed through a beautiful story co-authored by Prof. J.B Disanayaka and Namel Weeramuni, beautiful acting and beautiful music: a message, simple yet profound: Love has no boundaries.

World's first flying car
Next month the worlds first flying car will go on sale across the world. Pre-sales are scheduled to begin next month of the Terrafugia Transition flying car.
It is a two-seater hybrid-electric vehicle which will be able to switch between driving and flying modes in less than a minute. Deliveries of the new flying car will begin in early 2019.
The Terrafugia Transition will be able to fly up to 400 miles at speeds of up to 100mph. Prices for the new model have yet to be confirmed but China news agency Xinhua states that initial sales will begin in October.
Terrafugia, which is owned by parent company Volvo, have recently made some improvements to the car. This includes better seats, more storage, improved seatbelts, and airbags.
In addition this it has been given rear-view cameras and a new parachute system. Terrafugia has also fitted a boost mode which will give a brief burst of extra power while flying.
The vehicle has been certified as a Light Sport Aircraft by the Federal Aviation Administration in 2016 and also meets National Highway and Traffic Safety Administration standards.
Customers will, however, need to hold both a driving licence and a pilots license to be able to operate the vehicle.
The Transition will be able to fly at a maximum altitude of 10,000 feet and utilises fold out wings to be able to travel in the air.
The companys CEO Chris Jaran said earlier this year: Developing this new technology has allowed us to test several different mechanisms and generate process improvements along the way.
We are at the critical point where we can implement the best design features based on years of flight and drive testing.
