All should contribute to Govt.s production drive
Public Administration and Management Ministry Secretary J.J.Rathnasiri said yesterday that all Sri Lankans have a responsibility and obligation to increase food production and achieving self sufficiency in the country.
We all have felt the effects of the loss in food production caused by the recent drought and floods, he said. The impact of disasters on agriculture and food safety is severe, Rathnasiri said.Since disasters cannot be avoided, we must act to increase local food production by minimising the negative effects on livelihoods and the economy, he said. We have to be prepared from now to face such a situation in the future. That is why the National Food Production Battle was launched under the guidance of President Maithripala Sirisena, aiming to revive and strengthen the agricultural sector in a sustainable manner amid the challenges posed by climate changes, he added.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Rathnasiri said National Food Production Week was declared from October 6 to 12.
Accordingly, October 11 has been designated as public servants day and the inauguration ceremony in this regard will be held at the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council Auditorium and Ratnapura District Secretariat.
Each of the 1.5 million public servants in the country will have to plant two trees on October 11. Meanwhile, the government has also requested all government servants to start home gardens at all public institutions and government quarters.
Field officers like Samurdhi Development Officers, Grama Niladharis, and development officers have asked to start home gardens at their premises. This will lead all villagers to create home gardens in their premises, he added.
He further said a number of public awareness programmes will be implemented on national food production, toxins free food production and prevention of food wastage while several review meetings will also be held to analyze the progress of the entire programme.
Programmes for Public Servants Day will be implemented jointly by Public Administration and Management Ministry, Home Affairs Ministry and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry.
Home Affairs Ministry Secretary Neil de Alwis and Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Additional Secretary Sujan Nanayakkara were also spoke.

AG opposes Gammanpilas request to travel to Italy

The Attorney General today opposed Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpilas request that he be allowed to travel Italy between October 17 and November 4 to attend a function.
MP Gammanpila whose passport was impounded by Court for allegedly cheating Rs. 20 million following his alleged fraudulent share transaction, sought Colombo High Courts permission to temporary lift his travel ban.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake appearing for the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court Judge R. Gurusinghe that defiances request cannot be considered at this juncture since court had unable to conclude recording evidence from Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, the key witness of the case.
"It would be unfair to the aggrieved party, if court allowed the accused to go abroad without concluding his evidence, who has come all the way from Australia," Mr. Ratnayake said.
The High Court is to consider MP Gammanpila's request on next trial date.
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick, 74, the first witness in the alleged financial fraud case is to be further cross-examined on October 17.
The Attorney General (AG) alleged that MP Udaya Gammanpila has misappropriated Rs. 20 million when selling the shares of Digital Nominees to businessman Dhammika Perera.
The AG further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell the shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shaddick. The AG has listed 20 persons as witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items of the case. MP Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016. He is currently out on bail.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake, with Senior State Counsel Nayana Seneviratne appeared for the Attorney General.

Angoda condominium apartment complex to be put up for sale

The 500 unit condominium apartment complex in Angoda built for low income families in Colombo has been put up for sale as the families have refused to move from their shanties in Colombo to condominiums in Angoda.
The Urban Regeneration Project under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development had proposed to build a five storied condominium apartment complex on five acres in the Angoda Hospital premises.
The Ministry had proposed this as a solution to removing underserving settlements from the heart of Colombo. The overall goal of the Urban Regeneration Project was to build 70,000 housing units to resettle the low income families.
The low income families however have stated that they were not willing to move to Angoda, given their childrens education, access to work and other amenities and facilities.
Minister of Megapolis and Western Development, Champika Ranawaka this week submitted a cabinet proposal to sell these flats to members of the tri-forces, lower middle income government servants, artists, small and medium businessmen and women and civil activists.
Cabinet thus granted approval on Tuesday to publish advertisements in the newspapers and call for interested parties to purchase these flats. The unit built at a cost of Rs 3.4 million each is to be sold between Rs 4-5 million.
The apartment complex is expected to be complete by the end of this year.

Cabinet nod to import 50, 000 MT rice

Sathosa received cabinet approval to import 50,000 metric tons of rice to cover expected rice shortages in the near future.
The Yala season rice harvest this year had fallen by 50 percent as a result of the drought and this has led to a possible shortage of rice in the market until December of this year.
Of the total amount needed, 100,000 metric tons have already been imported from India and a committee is to be appointed under the leadership of the Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to make arrangements to import the remaining 400,000 metric tons.
The above was proposed through a joint proposal by Minister of Industry and Commerce, Rishard Bathuideen, Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera, Minister of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources, Mahinda Amaraweera and Minister of International Trade and Development Strategies, Malik Samarawickrama.

California fires: Scores missing as death toll rises to 15
More than 150 people are missing in wildfires that have ravaged northern California's wine region, police say.
At least 15 people are confirmed dead and more than 1,500 homes have been destroyed by the fires which broke out on Sunday.
Nine of the deaths have been in Sonoma County.
One of the worst affected towns there is Santa Rosa, north of San Francisco, where entire districts have been razed to the ground.
The Sonoma County sheriff's office said 155 people were still unaccounted for, although that could be due to the chaotic pace of the evacuations.
In neighbouring Napa County, victims included 100-year-old Charles Rippey and his 98-year-old wife, Sarah, police said.
The fires are among the deadliest in California's history and have sent smoke as far south as San Francisco, about 60 miles (100km) away.
California fire chief Ken Pimlott told the BBC on Tuesday that more than 17 fires had burned about 115,000 acres (26,000ha) in the past 24 hours.
He said his officers were trying to track down those unaccounted for but he feared the death toll could rise.
"We're very hopeful that they're just staying with family or friends or left town to get away and we just haven't been able to make that contact," he said.
"But these fires move so quickly - there are just hundreds and thousands of acres out there that we haven't had a chance to pour through and adjudicate."
There was some good news when winds that had been fanning the flames eased, helping firefighters to bring some of the blazes under control.
In Santa Rosa, a Hilton hotel and a mobile home park were destroyed. Tens of thousands of Sonoma County residents have fled, authorities said.
At least four wineries had suffered "total or very significant losses", Napa Valley Vintners said, with nine others reporting some damage to buildings or vineyards.
More than 91,000 homes and businesses are without power.
California Governor Jerry Brown declared states of emergency in Sonoma, Napa and five other counties.
US President Donald Trump has also approved a disaster declaration, allowing federal emergency aid to be disbursed.

Certain religious, cultural practices a barrier to womens empowerment: Harsha
Certain religious and cultural practices are barriers to womens empowerment in Sri Lanka, National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said.
The challenges that we face in this country and in the region, I think, has a lot do with what we call culture: religious practices and societal norms, he said.
There seems to be barriers that restrict womens agency.
Deputy Minister De Silva was addressing a conference on womens empowerment in South Asia at the Jetwing Hotel Tuesday morning.
Eventhough rates of womens education have risen significantly in recent years, theres a significant unexplained gap between education achievements and women ending up working and having an income.
He said mens expectations that women stay in the home and take care of children are one of the main roadblocks to the workforce.
Unpaid labour that women are expected to do, particularly in this part of the world, is a main cultural barrier, he said.
De Silva said that he personally is an example of this disparity: he said he had not attended any of his daughters parents meetings with teachers this year, while his wife had.
This is something that husbands and wives need to sit down and sort out internally, he said. But I must tell you, on Sundays I do go to the market with my wife and help choose vegetables, he added. And a lot of people tell me this is really nice to see, and I take a little bit of pride in that.
In terms of other barriers to work, the Deputy Minister said Sri Lankas reputation regarding sexual harassment was embarrassing.
Harassment in public transport has been a pernial problem and as a result women dont want to go to work in those packed buses and trains, he said.
He said the government should further incentivize womens entrepreneurship. He also praised the recent initiative to establish a 25 percent quota for women in local government elections.

Colombo Air Symposium begins tomorrow
The Colombo Air Symposium, the prominent international event that brings together global expertise on airpower to a common platform will be held for the third consecutive year from tomorrow (12) at the Eagles Lakeside Banquet and Convention Hall, Ratmalana.
The Colombo Air Symposium which is held under the auspicies of the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) will focus on national, regional and global issues and also discuss common security threats, both man-made and natural,Air Force Commander Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy said.
The symposium, held under the theme Airpower in Addressing Asymmetric Threats will be graced by State Defence Minister Ruwan Wijewardene. The symposium will also focus on six areas,such as, application of airpower, cyber warfare, how to utilize and safe use of dons and their regulations, airpower and counter terrorism and so on.
The Sri Lanka Air Force organises the Colombo Air Symposium annually with a view of developing a wider perspective of the world of airpower and to increase cooperation, understanding and goodwill among the various participating nations, the Air Force Commander said.
The SLAF as the weighty hand of Sri Lankan airpower contributed immensely to the ending of the countrys 30-year LTTE terrorist war which claimed thousands of lives while causing billions of rupees to property, he said. As Sri Lanka ventures in the direction of national development and national cohesion, those veterans of air power who overcame all odds in finally achieving victory in bringing about peace and stability, are now steering the organization in reaching the national objectives of security and development.
The experience, resources and the tested organizational structures are becoming crucial components in creating a better tomorrow for our nation, Air Marshal Jayampathy said. He added that the precision and the effectiveness of the SLAF were the key ingredients that contributed to the success of airpower against the particularly virulent form of terrorism that had started expanding to the realm of the air space over Sri Lanka as well.
Whilst the global community strives to maintain peace and the stability, global terrorism is growing and expanding with its ancillary enterprises made up of forgers, paid assassins, computer hackers, illegal transporters, human traffickers, and money launderers, the Air Force Commander said.
The conventional face to face combat of the past has been replaced with high-tech and asymmetric threats which are difficult to trace or counter. Terrorism is a global threat that keeps changing faces and phases in highly dynamic manner.
Today the world is also faced with many major challenges in the realms of climate change and natural disasters. Nature knows no man made boundaries and claims no interest in geopolitical interests of the nations. Thus there is a high likelihood of regional level natural hazards developing into global concerns and crises. A mass scale natural disaster with complex outcomes requires multiple approaches in dealing with them, Air Marshal Jayampathy said.
The proper integration of airpower in dealing with global challenges is the major test that confronts governments around the world, because while Airpowers inherent strengths makes it an essential component of all relief and support measures, its inherent limitations make it critical that it be used and deployed with careful consideration, he added.

Diary of Anne Frank transformed into graphic adaptation

"We do have similar personalities. I'm a bookworm, I love books."
India is 14 years old. She's wrapped up in a maroon Harry Potter hoodie.
Like so many readers around the world, Anne Frank has helped her to understand an otherwise unimaginable and distant chapter of history.
India is one of a group of pupils congregated outside a canal-side warehouse in Amsterdam, where Anne's father once sold the gelling agent pectin. They've come to learn more about the life of the young wartime diarist.
Anne Frank was 15 when she died. She was an aspiring author, and one of more than a million Jewish children killed in the Holocaust.
Today her diary - which she nicknamed Kitty - is one of the most-read books in the world. Her teenage prose has spawned Hollywood screenplays, Broadway shows and countless other (re)productions.
Now it has been adapted into comic-strip format, in a book produced by the creators of the Oscar-nominated animation Waltz with Bashir, and there is a film coming soon too.
Accompanied by excerpts from her diaries and letters, the "graphic diary" depicts the story of how Anne Frank and her family went into hiding after her sister Margot received a summons to report to a Nazi work camp.
They survived for almost two years, tiptoeing around in the dark, damp confines of the "achterhuis" (secret annex) before being discovered.
Nazis emptied Anne's schoolbag to carry cash and jewellery looted from Jewish homes - her distinctive red-checked diary was recovered from the floor of the hideout.
Ari Folman, author and director of the new graphic adaptation, says he wants to ensure Anne's legacy remains relevant.
"The Graphic Diary is the perfect solution for the next generation," he says.
"To reach the readers of the diary you also have to find their language - more people will get to know the story. Period."
In fact, readership of the original is increasing every year.
Anne Frank has come to symbolise courage, optimism and determination.
But it is her teenage attitude and frustrations that resonate with young people.
"It's easy to understand. She's eloquent," explains Eilidh Lean from the Anne Frank Trust, as she follows the Scottish students towards the secret annex where the Frank family hid.
"Six million people [approximate number of Jews murdered during World War Two] is difficult to get their heads around. Anne puts a human face on it. You can tell she's 13. She's going through puberty. They can empathise with her."
But reimaging Anne's famous prose in cartoon form was not an easy decision.
Illustrator David Polonsky was initially reluctant, for fear of becoming part of the "Holocaust industry" sometimes accused of commodifying the Diary of a Young Girl (also known as The Diary of Anne Frank).
But he hopes the images will inform and stimulate contemporary debates about people forced out of their homes by politicians waging war.
"It is one story about one person, and each immigrant has a different story, too," he says.
At the Montessori primary that Anne Frank attended before the Nazis created Jewish-only schools, not all the pupils are convinced the new version is necessary.
The concrete building stands in the southern suburbs, away from the city centre tourist strips. Colourful children's bikes lean against one another outside.
Eleven-year-old pupils Sammy Neeter and Zahara Belen Mackay are conscious of the historical significance of their environment, proudly leading me to see Anne's old wooden desk. Sammy says it's "weird but cool" that he used to sit in her classroom.
His mother read Anne Frank's diary to him when he was seven years old. What does this earnest young man make of the comic-book style of interpretation
"When you look at the pictures you cannot really see what happened; when you read the diary you can see more with your imagination..."
But Zahara believes this approach could help to engage younger audiences.
"It's nice for little children, but once you go to the secondary school you should just read the original book because it's very nice and it actually has her words."
The pupils from Dundee's Harris Academy have stepped out of the claustrophobic confines of the secret annex and into the invigorating autumn sunshine; inspired after literally walking an hour in Anne Frank's footsteps.
"It's quite surreal," Joshua reflects, gazing downwards. "I saw how she lived... being determined and, like, just getting through and keeping on going.
"Now we've been here we can see how this genocide happened and we need to go home and really band together to make sure it never happens again."
The Graphic Diary of Anne Frank is published in the Netherlands and Germany. An English edition will reach audiences in the UK and US early 2018. An animated film is scheduled for release in 2019.

Liljelund made this observation when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe visited the AW Energy facility during his official visit to Helsinki, Finland on Monday (9).It was highlighted that eventhough waves are not used to produce energy in many parts of the world, there are higher possiblities for it to be used as one of the main sources to produce energy in future. According to the research conducted so far, the Indian Ocean has been identified as a region to produce wave energy. It would be used to produce environment friendly wave energy, electricity, clean the sea water and pump water.
The project was explained to the Sri Lanka delegates by the Chief Executive Officer John Lilielund while Chief Technical Officer Christopher Ridgwell, Business Development Officer Tomas Mucha and Chief Engineer Sami Pasanen were present.

India Supreme Court rules sex with child bride is rape

India's Supreme Court has struck down a legal clause that permits men to have sex with their underage wives.
The clause, which was part of India's law on rape, said intercourse between a man and his wife was permissible as long as she was over 15 years of age.
The age of consent in India is 18, but marital rape is not considered an offence. The verdict has been hailed by women's rights activists.
However correspondents say that the order will be difficult to enforce.
The judgement said that girls under 18 would be able to charge their husbands with rape, as long as they complained within one year of being forced to have sexual relations.
"This is a landmark judgement that corrects a historical wrong against girls. How could marriage be used as a criteria to discriminate against girls" Vikram Srivastava, the founder of Independent Thought, one of the main petitioners in the case, told the BBC.
However, the BBC's Geeta Pandey in Delhi says that while welcome, the order will be difficult to implement in a country where child marriage is still rampant.
"Courts and police cannot monitor people's bedrooms and a minor girl who is already married, almost always with the consent of her parents, will not usually have the courage to go to the police or court and file a case against her husband," our correspondent says.
India's government says the practice of child marriage is "an obstacle to nearly every developmental goal: eradicating poverty and hunger; achieving universal primary education; promoting gender equality; protecting children's lives; and improving women's health".

Journalist was seen actively taking part in Hambantota protest - Sagala

Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka said Susantha Bandara Karunaratne, the journalist who claimed he was assaulted by a senior Police officer during a protest in Hambantota last week, had actively taken part in the protest.
"He was not assaulted when carrying out the duties of a journalist. Karunaratne's active involvement in the protest, despite a court order, led to the confrontation with the Police," the Minister said, commenting on the matter.
Daily News is now in possession of several photographs in which Susantha Bandara Karunaratne, the journalist who claimed he was assaulted by a senior Police officer, is seen actively taking part in the protest, holding placards.
"The law should apply to both sides equally. While the Police officer is under criticism for slapping a protester at the heat of the moment, it is also important to know that Karunaratne was not assaulted while covering the protest as a journalist. He was a protester actively taking part in the demonstration. The incident has to be understood in the right context," Ratnayaka explained.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara has already called for a report on the incident from the regional Police chief.

North Korea crisis: US bombers conduct military drills

The US has conducted a joint military exercise with South Korea, flying two strategic bombers over the Korean peninsula.
The B-1B combat bombers were joined by two South Korean F-15K fighter jets, and carried out air-to-ground missile drills off South Korean waters.
It comes amid heightened tensions with North Korea over its nuclear programme.
Pyongyang conducted its sixth nuclear test, and launched two missiles over Japan, in recent months.
The bombers took off from the US Pacific territory of Guam on Tuesday night, before entering South Korean airspace and conducting firing exercises over the East Sea and Yellow Sea, South Korea's military said.
The training was part of a programme of "extended deterrence" against North Korea, it added.
The US said Japan's air force also took part in the drill.
US President Donald Trump met top officials from his national security team on Tuesday night for a briefing on ways to respond to threats from North Korea, theWhite House said.
Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un have exchanged heated rhetoric in recent weeks.
In a speech at the UN in September, Trump accused Kim of being "on a suicide mission" - while Kim responded by vowing to "tame the mentally deranged US dotard with fire".
On Wednesday, a South Korean lawmaker said North Korean hackers had reportedly stolen a large cache of military documents from his country, including a plan to assassinate North Korea's leader Kim Jong-un, and wartime contingency plans drawn up by the US and South Korea.
The South Korean defence ministry refused to comment about the allegation, while North Korea denied the claim.

SC petitioned on invasion of privacy, central database profiling
Relief has been sought in Sri Lankas highest court against at attempt by the Department of Registration of Persons to build a central database with comprehensive data, profiling every citizen, containing entire family trees and giving virtually unrestricted access to any information concerning any citizen recorded with any public authority.
The petitioner said the regulations were unreasonable, capricious arbitrary and breached the reasonableness, fairness, proportionality, legitimate expectation, natural justice.
The regulations were issued under a law already passed in Parliament, which gives the defence secretary powers to examine the record of any citizen, even those who had not committed any crime, without a court order.
The petition comes after Indian courts ruled in favour of citizens who protested an electronic ID and database, which was subject to widespread abuse and hacking.
The petitioner said Sri Lanka citizens ran the risk of hacking as the database would become a magnet for hackers, and be abused by interested parties for personal or political gain.
The regulations sought data on the person, his family, children, spouse, building an entire family tree in a central database. The regulation also seeks divorce case files and email addresses.
The collection of a full family tree of all citizens with information concerning each person offers little or no public service or benefit, the petitioner said. However, it would enable the identification and monitoring of relatives of a particular individual and will enable the targeting of family members of opponents for personal or political gain.

Sustainable Development Ministry to uplift cut flower industry
Considering the growing market demand for cut flowers in the local and international market, the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry has taken various measures to expand the countrys cut flower industry, Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena said.
Accordingly, the Ministry has implemented various programmes to assist cut flower growers by providing planting materials, knowledge and technical assistance to them.
Immediate measures would also be taken to sign a Memorandum of Understanding between flower growers and exporters enabling flower growers to engage in this industry without any risk of losing their income, said the Deputy Minister.
She also invited flower growers to grow more roses and jasmines to meet the huge market demand for these flowers in the local market.
Though Sri Lanka produces around 500,000 roses per a month, thats not sufficient to meet the market demand. Therefore, we have to import roses and jasmines from India and Netherlands. The flower growers would be able to earn a good income by growing roses and jasmines, she said. The Minister further stressed the importance of producing high quality flowers in order to meet the growing market needs.
The government has taken measures to increase foreign exchange earnings through the expansion of the cut flower industry.
In 2015, Sri Lanka had earned $ 13.9 million through cut flower exports. But it has reduced to $ 13.6 in 2016. Hence the Sustainable Development and Wildlife Ministry has taken measures to encourage flower growers to pay urgent attention to the increase of cut flower exports.
Netherlands and Japan are major buyers of Sri Lankan cut flowers and there is a huge demand for roses, carnations and orchids in their market.

Thailand bans smoking on popular tourist beaches

Thailand is introducing a smoking ban on beaches across the country with those caught violating the law facing up to a year in prison.

The head of the department, Jatuporn Buruspat, said that up to 138,000 cigarette butts had been collected by the environmental group over a 2.5km (1.5 miles) stretch of Patong beach in Phuket.
Mr Buruspat added that the while smoking will be prohibited on the beaches affected by the measure, there will be "designated areas" further inland where smokers will be able drop their litter "in provided containers".
The penalty for violating the ban is up to a year in prison or a possible fine of up to 100,000 baht ($3,000; 2,280).
The ban, which will come into effect next month, will apply to beaches in the provinces of Phuket, Prachuap Khiri Khan, Chon Buri and Songkhla, and includes the popular resorts of Koh Samui and Pattaya, the Bangkok Postreports.
Thailand is initially implementing the ban on 20 beaches but said that if successful the measure could be uniformly adopted.

Mahendran was extensively questioned on his involvement in an on sight investigation done on Perpetual Treasuries Limited and investigation on Employees Provident Fund over several transactions it has conducted in the Treasury Bond market.
Mahendran was also grilled over the meeting held by the former Finance Minister for allegedly instructing State Banks to bid low at Treasury Bond auctions on March 29 and 31, 2016.
At the wrapping up of cross examination, the matters of Mahendrans conflict of interest with regards to his son-in-law Arjun Aloysius and on the allegation that Mahendran gave insider information to the same regarding Treasury Bond auctions which are being probed by the Treasury Bond Commission.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake questioning Mahendran on the on sight investigation called for PTL in early 2016, observed that Mahendran has shown less enthusiasm in conducting investigation on his son-in-laws company.
DSG MG: Are you aware that when you were the Governor, there was this regulatory process continued somewhere in September 2016 on PTL
AM: Arjun Aloysius contacted me and he said that activities of his company have been suspended.
DSG MG: Are you aware of a report making it into the press regarding the report on PTL
AM: Yes, there was a leakage of report.
DSG MG: Belonging to Perpetual Treasuries Limited
AM: Yes. All I know is that there was an ongoing investigation. Not only with PTL but also on several other Primary Dealers as well.
DSG MG: Are you talking about the MB paper on Entrust (A Primary Dealer)
AM: Yes we were very much concerned about the sanctity and confidence of investors in the market affected by Entrust which had gone under serious systematic events.
DSG MG: Entrust was restricted in November 2016
AM: Yes, I heard so.
DSG MG: Are you aware that somewhere in July 2016, PTLs license was cancelled
AM: Yes I am aware.
DSG MG: Would it be possible that this whole process which culminated in PTL being suspended would have happened in January 2016 if that examination on PTL was conducted in January 2016
AM: Not at all my lord. There were more PDs with whom we had similar issues in similar nature and attitude. I can bring those documents. There were more aggravating issues at that time. So we had to have our act together. And all the supervisory reports were gathered. For example, we issued a letter on HSBC primary dealer who had similar type of discrepancies to PTL. The HSBC closed down their PD. It is not that we gave special treatment to PTL. There was bad practice in the market.
DSG MG: You said compared to what went in the market, what PTL had done was a minor offense
AM: No, I am not saying that. There was a shortage of officers as well to carry out all these investigations. The priority was to solve this Entrust issue. There were some documents put on my desk with regard to handing over Rs.2.5 billion of money to a company called Standard Finance. I was horrified at this. I asked why do we have to subsidize a finance company, but the Department insisted. Then, the Monetary Board immediately conducted an audit. That audit called for a thorough investigation into this company. Again to our dismay, we found out that the Central Bank has parked Rs. 6 billion in that PD which was lost up to date. These issues should have been addressed earlier. But, we had to prioritize them.
DSG MG: My question was as to why you took so long to transfer the regulatory functions of the PDD to the Supervision Department
AM: We had an emergency MB meeting on January 1, 2016 to speak on this matter.
DSG MG: How are you in a position to judge that the PTLs offense was less important or more important than the other investigation
AM: It was not brought to my attention by the officers, my lord. They did not tell me that the PTLs investigation is more important than the issue with the Entrust.
DSG MG: The on-sight examination clearly raises the alarm about some serious violations from the part of PTL in January. If that investigation was conducted vigorously, perhaps this Commission will not be sitting today
AM: I completely disagree.
DSG Gunatilake then questioned Mahendran on gains by PTL in 2015 in the Primary and Secondary Bond Market and Employees Provident Funds biddings at an auction held on November 2,2015. He also questioned Mahendran on a decision with regards to installation of call recording system at the EPF.
DSG Gunatilake referred the witness to a document which was a summary of Treasury Bond sales and Capital Gains of the PTL for the month of November 2015.
He pointed out that these documents must have reached the Monetary Board by December 2015.
According to the document, PTL in 2015, have gained 89% of all the capital gains recorded by all stand alone Primary Dealers in the market.
It also shows that the most profitable Primary Dealer in the same year was the PTL. It was also evident DSG Gunatilake pointed out that 53% of the profits made by all Primary Dealers and licensed banks, was of PTL as well.
DSG MG: When you saw this document (Referring to the summery of Treasury bond sales in November 2015) in December 2015, was there anything you were concerned
AM: No, not really.
DSG MG: In November 2015, EPF bought 12 bilion in the Primary Market where as it bought Rs. 45 billion in the Secondary Market. Did not this receive you with some concern
AM: Not at all. On the contrary, they were doing their job. They are marking considerable profits from trading in Secondary Market.
They were doing so in 2014 as well, which was an outstanding effort and achievement from the EPF team. They were making substantial profits, even while their outflows were increasing. They had to find additional income in order to make up for the short falls.
DSG MG: Why buying from the Secondary market when they can buy from the Primary Market
AM: You cannot predetermine how much you buy from the Primary Market. They have to compete with the others in the Primary Market. The solution to EPF getting more bonds in the Primary Market, will be to give a separate amount of bonds to the EPF. The Monetary Board can take a decision with effect to that.
DSG MG: On November 2, 2015, EPF did not buy Treasury bonds in the Primary Market. But they bought the same bond in the secondary market. Is this probe worthy
AM: Yes.
DSG MG: You must have known about this contemporaneously
AM: No.
DSG MG: But you were in charge
AM: Yes.
DSG MG: You were sent daily summery reports from EPF
AM: Yes. Data on these transactions were presented in December 2015. At theJanuary 2016 Monetary Board meeting, Krishantha Perera brought up this issue.
DSG MG: But why did you not inquire about it
AM: There were several other high officials looking into the matter down the line.
My presumption on EPFs conduct was that they acted in good faith. There could have been several reasons as to why they bought from the secondary market instead of the primary market. Several EPF officers reasoned out with regards to this decision as well.
DSG MG: I am asking you why you waited one month until Krishantha Perera raised this issue at the monetary Board
AM: My lord, I am not perfect. Somethings slipped my gaze.
DSG MG: So this slipped your gaze
AM: Yes
DSG MG: Have you acted then, it could have been different
AM: I do not agree. We started inquring into this in January. BEPF superintendent recommended that certain lapses were noticed but it does not warrant any action being taken against the officer concered at that time. His recommendation was to keep watching the process and the officers concered.
DSG MG: Who were the officers
AM: I do not recall exactly.
DSG MG: Could have been Indiaka Saman Kumara
AM: Yes possibly. The Front Office also had several more officers working there.
Subsequent to more vigorous questioning by DSG Gunatilake, Mahendran admitted that it was a slip of his gaze due to which an expedite examination was not conducted on the said transactions done on November 2, 2015, by the EPF in the Treasury Bond market.
DSG Gunatilake then suggested that Mahendran purposefully delayed installing a telephone call recording system at the EPF.
Taking former Superintendent of the Employees Provident Fund, Assistant Governor R.A. Jayalath in to consideration, DSG Gunatilake suggested that Mahendran did not pay attention to a report prepared by Jayalath on certain malpractices taken place in the EPF.
In response, Mahendran said he requested Jayalath to conduct an investigation on the practices of EPF following a concern raised by Krishantha Perera at a Monetary Board meeting.
DSG Gunatilake asked Mahendran as to what prompt him top request for a probe. Mahendran said there was a Kele Paththaraya regarding the EPF because of which the concerns were raised and a probe was conducted.
Meanwhile, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera questioned Mahendran on a meeting chaired by former Minister Ravi Karunanayake where he alleged to have instructed the State Banks to bid at low rates at the March 29 and 31, 2016 Treasury Bond auctions. SASG De Livera asked Mahendran if he was aware or not about the aforesaid meeting. Mahendran denied knowing of any such meeting.
SASG de Livera then asked Mahendran if he was aware that his son-in-law was paying for a penthouse occupied by former Minister Ravi Karunanayake and his family. Mahendran said he never knew until it came up in evidence at the Commission.
SASG de Livera repeatedly questioned Mahendran on the penthouse until Commissioner Justice P.S.Jayawardena pointed out that You have repeated the same question ten times now!.
Mahendrans Counsel Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva told De Livera that he is making a speech! while Aloysiuss Counsel Anuja Premaratne PC also objected the line of questioning. Justice Jayawardena then said, Just let Mr. Livera say what he wants to say and continued saying It appears to be Mr. de Liveras evidence!. Following de Liveras continued grilling of the witness, Justice Jayawardena said This (De Liveras statements) appears to be for the press!.
Mahendran said he is unable to answer questions with regards to a penthouse or a meeting that he never knew.
