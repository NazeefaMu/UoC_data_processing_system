Series win will move Sri Lanka to sixth slot
England will aim to narrow the gap with third-ranked Pakistan while Sri Lanka will target moving ahead of sixth-ranked South Africa in the MRF Tyres ICC Team Rankings when the three-Test series begins at Headingley on Thursday.
England currently sits in fourth position on 105 points (six behind Pakistan), while Sri Lanka is on 88 points in seventh spot (four behind South Africa). If England wins all the three Tests, then it will rise to 109 points (two behind Pakistan) while a 2-0 win will put it on 108 points (three behind Pakistan).
In contrast, Sri Lanka can move to as high as 98 points, but to make this to happen, it will have to win all three Tests. In this scenario, there will be a three-way tie between New Zealand, England and Sri Lanka, but when the rankings are calculated beyond the decimal point, then New Zealand will be ranked fourth, England fifth and Sri Lanka sixth.
A 2-1 or 1-0 win will earn Sri Lanka six points, which will put it two points ahead of South Africa, while a 2-0 win will put the Asian side on 96 points.
This is the ninth time England is hosting Sri Lanka in a Test series. Of the previous eight series, England has won four, while Sri Lanka has triumphed twice, including a 1-0 win on the previous tour in 2014 with the 100-run victory coming at Headingley in the second and final Test.
Overall, England leads Sri Lanka 6-5 in 14 series, while in 28 Tests played between the two sides to date, England has won 10 against Sri Lankas eight.
Meanwhile, Joe Root will resume his battle for the number-one batting position with Australia captain Steve Smith, who is presently sitting on top of the tree. Root, who twice peaked to the number-one ranking last year, trails Smith by 36 points. Some strong performances with the bat will help the Yorkshireman surge to the top and then potentially strengthen his position in the four-Test series against Pakistan, which begins on July 14.
Australia returns to the Test arena at almost the same time when it travels to Sri Lanka for a three-Test series, which begins in Pallekele on July 26.
Sri Lanka captain Angelo Mathews is the other batsman who features inside the top 10. He is currently occupying the eighth position and has a chance to return to the top five as he trails fifth-ranked Younus Khan of Pakistan by 18 points.
Those outside the top 10 and aiming to improve their rankings include England captain Alastair Cook (14th) and Sri Lankas Dinesh Chandimal (20th).
England fast bowler Stuart Broad will defend his number-one position when he will take the field at Headingley.
The 29-year-old moved to the top of the chart following the Johannesburg Test against South Africa earlier this year, and leads India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin by just one point. Not only to retain his number-one spot but to also put some daylight between himself and Ashwin, Broad will need to put in some impressive performances in the series.
Not too far behind is his new-ball partner James Anderson. The Lancastrian, who achieved his career-high second ranking against the West Indies last year in Barbados, is currently in fifth position, and trails third-ranked Yasir Shah of Pakistan by 41 points and fourth-ranked Dale Steyn of South Africa by 36 points.
Left-arm spinner Rangana Herath is Sri Lankas highest-ranked bowler in 11th position and has an opportunity to return to the top 10 as he is just five points behind South Africas 10th-ranked Vernon Philander. Steven Finn of England is eight places and 121 points behind the Sri Lankan.
England boasts two players inside the top five of the all-rounders list. Broad is third, while Ben Stokes is fourth. The list is headed by Indias Ashwin.

Thirty one new doping cases from Beijing Games risk ban - IOC
LAUSANNE, TUESDAY: Thirty-one athletes from 12 countries failed doping tests after new analysis of samples taken from the 2008 Beijing Olympics and could be banned from the Rio Games, the IOC said Tuesday.
The 31, who took part in six different sports, were among 454 samples retested following a new wave of doping scandals to hit international sport.
The International Olympic Committee executive board today agreed unanimously to initiate proceedings immediately, said an IOC statement.
All those athletes infringing anti-doping rules will be banned from competing at the Olympic Games Rio 2016.
The new tests focused on athletes who could take part in the Rio Olympics which start on August 5. The IOC said the very latest scientific analysis methods were used for the new examination of the samples.
The results from 250 retest from samples taken at the 2012 London Games are due shortly and mean the total failures could increase.
The IOC also warned that it will start a wider re-testing programme of medalists from Beijing and London. The samples of those athletes who could be awarded medals following the disqualification of others will also be retested.
The IOC board demanded that the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) start a fully fledged investigation into allegations that samples taken at the Sochi Winter Olympics in 2014 were subverted by Russian athletes.
IOC president Thomas Bach called the allegations made against the Sochi laboratory worrying. The statement said new tests of Sochi samples will be carried out at the Lausanne anti-doping laboratory, where the Sochi samples are stored for 10 years.
We keep samples for 10 years so that the cheats know that they can never rest, said IOC president Thomas Bach.
All these measures are a powerful strike against the cheats we do not allow to win, he added.
They show once again that dopers have no place to hide.
Bach called the new measures another major step to protect the clean athletes irrespective of any sport or any nation.

Englands Vince determined to enjoy Test debut
LEEDS, TUESDAY: England's James Vince said Tuesday he was determined to enjoy his Test debut come what may at Headingley this week.
The Hampshire batsman is in line to fill the middle-order vacancy created by the shock retirement of James Taylor with a heart condition last month, when the first of a three-Test series against Sri Lanka starts at Yorkshire's headquarters in Leeds, northern England, on Thursday.
Vince, 25, has been compared to former England captain Michael Vaughan because of his batting style and there is also the view that he too will thrive in international cricket despite a solid rather than spectacular county record. Now Vince, who has already played limited overs cricket for England, is looking forward to seeing if he can make the step up to Test cricket. AFP

Tiger Woods: I can still beat Jack Nicklaus major record
He still thinks he can pass Jack Nicklaus as the most successful golfer ever, but Tiger Woods has no idea when he will return to competitive action.
The 14-time major champion maintains he is progressing nicely after a third back operation in October, but says he won't resume his career until he can practice, play and recover with no ill effects.
And despite not having won a major since 2008, the 40-year-old still believes he can overhaul Nicklaus record of 18 major titles. The Golden Bear won his final three majors past the age of 40, including his famous 1986 Masters title as a 46-year-old.
I think his major championship record is certainly still attainable, Woods told reporters at a media day for the PGA Tour's Quicken Loans National tournament that he hosts at Congressional Country Club in Maryland. Woods is also keen to beat Sam Snead's record of 82 PGA Tour wins -- he lies second on the list with 79 titles, the last of which came in August 2013.
It would be nice to end up at No. 1 on both lists, he said. That's a long way away and it's going to take time to get to that point but hopefully I can get back out here and play to that level.
Woods has not played since last August, but sparked rumors of a return with a series of public demonstrations at various engagements over the last month.
But he admitted Monday he didn't know whether his return would be next week or a year from now -- and proved his rustiness by hitting all three of his wedge shots into the water during a mini par-three competition.
