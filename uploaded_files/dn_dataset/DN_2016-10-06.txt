Climax of Enthiran 2.O between Akshay Kumar and Rajinikanth shot
We saw that superstar Rajinikanth can single-handedly bash up a hundred villains in Kabali. The film made his fans go crazy and how. Next year, he will face a solid villain in the form of Bollywood hunk Akshay Kumar. Yes, we are looking forward to Enthiran 2.0 for a variety of reasons. It has superstar Rajinikanth as a scientist and Amy Jackson is his love interest. It also marks the debut of Akshay Kumar as a villain down South. Today, we got a great piece of news.
Yes, famous stunt choreographer Stunt Silva revealed that the climax and fight sequences of Enthiran 2.O have already been shot. The film is expected to hit the marquee in April 2017 and everyone is damn excited about it. Stunt Silva shares a great rapport with filmmaker Shankar Shanmugham and superstar Rajinikanth. He has worked as a body double for Rajinikanth in Sivaji (2007). In the interview, he revealed that Shankar is his mentor and Godfather in the industry.
Rajinikanth has begun shooting for the film after a break of two months. He was having health issues. In fact, he is all set to shoot for a song with Amy Jackson. The Brit beauty also confirmed it in a tweet. Shankar is known to shoot songs first but his modus operandi is different this time round.
Actress Aishwarya Rai was the female lead in the original Robot, this time Shankar roped in Theri actor Amy Jackson who is quite popular down South. Bollywood actor Akshay Kumar will be playing the antagonist.He plays Dr Richard who turns into a crow as a result of a wrong experiment. In this sequel Rajinikanth will make a thundering comeback as Vaseegaran, the robotics scientist. The makers and technicians have confirmed that it is not a sequel to Robot.

Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales Teaser Trailer
Prepare yourselves, Pirates of the Caribbean fansthe first trailer for the fifth movie has finally arrived! A teaser for Dead Men Tell No Tales aired during Fear The Walking Dead, and it was definitely worth the wait. Watch the epic first video right here (https://www.youtube.com/watchv=1xo3af_6_Jk)!
We dont see Jack Sparrow (Johnny Depp, duh) or Will Turner (Orlando Bloom) in this trailer, theres plenty of foreshadowing of whats to come for the fifth films main characters. The new villain in Dead Men Tell No Tales is Captain Salazar, played by Javier Bardem, and in the almost 2-minute teaser clip we see the ghostly antagonist tell newcomer Henry (Brenton Thwaites) that death is upon Jack. Okay, can you say INTENSE!
This first look has been a long time coming for Pirates fans, as its been six years since the fourth installment, Pirates of the Caribbean: On Stranger Tides, hit theaters. Those who loved the original cast from the first film have also been eager for this next movie because Orlando Bloom will be reprising his famous role as Will Turner for the first time since 2007s Pirates of the Caribbean: At Worlds End. Now that we at least have a glimpse at how awesome the fifth movie will be, the excitement just got even bigger!
The story will revolve around a downtrodden Jack Sparrow and his nemesis, who escaped imprisonment in the Devils Triangle and, with the help of his ghostly crew, is now looking to destroy any pirate in his path  which includes Jack. To avoid being completely eradicated, Jack must find the Trident of Poseidon to give him the power to control the seas. As the captain of the Flying Dutchman, Will joins Jack on his quest, making for one classic Pirates film!
Other than the synopsis, we werent really given any indication about how things will end up for Jack in the latest Pirates installment. While its still not fully clear from the first look at Dead Men Tell No Tales (other than the fact that hes inevitably going to have to try escaping death), it does seem like this will have the same spirit of The Curse of the Black Pearl that made these movies such a phenomenon. If anything, it looks like one heck of a thrill ride! HollywoodLife

A veterans hockey match in honour of Roy de Silva
Plans afoot over in Kandy to play a hockey match between Kandy Veterans and Colombo Veterans, for a trophy in the name of Roy de Silva who will be celebrating his 80th birthday on Saturday. Roy will grace the game as chief guest.
Roys name was household in Kandy, Sri Lanka hockey and the National Olympic Council. Today only a handful would remember the role played by officials to uplift sports in the country. One such personality was Kandys Roy de Silva who should never be forgotten in the field of hockey and NOC. He was in the NOC for 14 long years from 1983 to 1997 and was the first from Kandy to hold that post till now. Roy as he is known among his friends was a product of Kingswood College. He was one of the finest sportsmen to come out of Kingswood College and also Kandy where he excelled in hockey, football, athletics and cricket.
Hockey was his pet sport at school and even later. He played for the schools senior hockey team at the age of 13, was the under 16 cricket captain and a top class athlete. All this by the age of 16. At this point he had to leave school, and was at St. Sylvesters College for a few months and later took to business and politics.
After leaving school, Roy played for Kandy Whites hockey team, and was an automatic choice for the Kandy District and Up-Country teams whenever they played against foreign teams. Later he took up hockey umpiring and helped his school in coaching. At one time he was rated as one of the top umpires. Roy also played cricket for Kandy United S.C. as a right-arm spinner. He was a stylish billiards and snooker player.
After giving up playing, he took to administration, and was the secretary of the Kandy District Hockey Association for ten years. From Kandy he was elected as the president of the Sri Lanka Hockey Federation, and held the post from 1979 to 1998. During his term of office, the womens national hockey championship was introduced and a cup was presented by him. He also had the rare privilege of being the vice president of the Asian Hockey Federation from 1979 to 1983. At that time Roy gave a big hand for Kandy hockey. Today great effort is needed to bring club hockey in Kandy back to the position where it was some years ago. It is sad that hockey has taken a back seat at club level in Kandy, despite this sport reaching great heights in the past, particularly when the Kandy District Hockey Association was headed by Roy.
Every person who loves hockey in the hill capital is waiting eagerly for the revival of club hockey. There are no league or knockout tournaments. They only play a one-day tournament and that too a seven-a-side. Hockey is one of the cheapest games to play, which every youth can afford. It has taken a back seat in the club circles, despite the fact that some of the officials in the governing body hail from Kandy. The Kandy District Hockey Association today is like a ship sans a rudder without proper organized tournaments and lack of administration capacity.
Roy was elected as vice president of the National Olympic Council in 1979 and held the post till he became president in 1983. He was the president for 14 years, which is a record. He was elected to the post of vice president of the Asian Olympic Council in 1986 and his finest moment came in 1990 when he was elected as the acting president of the Asian Olympic Council, and had the privilege of opening the 1990 Asian Games in China. Roy also had the privilege of being in the Finance Committee of the Commonwealth Federation from 1990 to 1998 and was elected as the Life President of the SAF games in 1996. He was one time president of the Kandy Cricket Club and later president of Kandy District Cricket Association, where under him several international games were played in Kandy.
Roy was also the president of the Kingswoodians Old Boys Union. He presented a trophy in memory of the founder of the school and the person who introduced rugby to the school L. E. Blaze, for the annual rugby match between Kingswood College and Wesley College. Now this encounter is famous in the schools calendar. Roy was the long serving president of the Kandy Club for 14 years, and he is the man who brought up the club from the grave yard to its present standard. It will be a great gesture, if the Kandy Club can name the main hall as Roy de Silva hall for the service he has rendered to this club, as a member, committee member and president and trustee.
