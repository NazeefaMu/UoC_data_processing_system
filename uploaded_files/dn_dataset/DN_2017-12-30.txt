The Coast Conservation Department and the Coast Resources Management Department had already investigated the reason for the pollution.
The fisher folk in the area said the pollution has posed a severe problem for them as it has jeopardised the aquatic life. Tourists arrivals in the area now have reduced considerably as a result of the bad smell, they said.

Illegal sand excavations at Yan Oya
Amidst several controversial issues, mainly the resettlement of destitute families which is dragging on for long period, the closing of the Yan Oya reservoir's river mouth is scheduled to be commenced on March 15 next year. The project management is now facing a big problem of leveling and back-filling of large pits and ditches scattered in the site, that has resulted from large scale sand excavation and digging in progress at the Yan Oya sand Deposit, located in the reservoir landscape, due to reckless breaching of all legal criteria.
It is learnt that although there is a condition that digging sand shall be limited to three meters interior, some irresponsible contractors have dug sand deep down beyond three meters. Sans any standard monitoring system executed by the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau, thus allowing to cause a serious seeping effect when the naked Yan Oya reservoir landscape is being filled with Yan Oya river water.
According to a spokesman of the Yan Oya reservoir project, in terms of the Environment Impact Assessment report concerning Yan Oya reservoir project (08/EIA/Water/01/2001), the forest cover within the reservoir site shall not be cleared or disposed of even in the event at filling the reservoir. But due to the unwarranted stubborn sand excavation and digging activities, the forest cover is at the verge of destruction and diminishing.
It is disclosed that the sand washing process presently done within the reservoir landscape without any monitoring mechanism has been creating a large scale sediment deposit as a byproduct, thus making it possible to expand the sediment cover in to the lower Yan Oya lanscape. At the Yan Oya sand deposit review committee meeting recently held with Anuradhapura government Agent R. M. Wanninayake in the chair, a batch of farmers representing the Yan Oya destitute families community vehemently objected to the Yan Oya sand deposit and unscrupulous human activities there, complaining to the committee that apart from dust causing a several health hazard, the uncontrolled travelling of heavy tipper lorries loaded with sand up and down have been causing irreparable damages to the roadways in the area.
Under these circumstances, the project management has requested the higher authorities not to issue any new sand digging or transport permits and not to extend the validation of the existing permits, totally with effect from the end of December 2017.
It is reported, that the sand businessman and racketeers have been pressing the irrigation ministerial officials and political authority to have the Yan Oya sand deposit kept opened for sand excavation for a longer period, ignoring the recommendations for the closure of the deposit by project management and the sand digging review committee.
Yan Oya reservoir top officials have warned the authorities, that due to the endless sand digging close to Wahalkadara tank, a large scale seepage effect could be possible apart from causing damages to the Wahalkadara tank bund.

Increase in HIV/Aids infected in Puttalam
The number of HIV/Aids infected patients in the Puttalam district had increased to 113 from 70, Dr. Nandika Rohan Amarajeewa of the Chilaw Hospital Socially Transmitted Diseases Unit said.
He said the number had incresed despite the clinics held in the Chilaw, Puttalam, Kalpitiya, Anamaduwa, and Marawila hospitals. He said the Unit was active 365 days of the year and any suspected patient could visit to the clinics and undergo a free investigation including blood tests to clear their doubts about contracting the diseases.
He said homosexual activities among males had been one of the causes that contributed towards spreading of the disease. Youngsters are more vulnerable to contract the disease via homosexual activity, he said.

Kandy favourites to beat Police
The 2017/18 Rugby League second round gets underway and there is a fair amount of hype surrounding this showcase event. There is no doubt that
With the 2017/18 Dialog rugby league second round getting underway defending champions Kandy S.C. will prove very tough to beat as they go into the tournament as deserving favorites. Today they will play Police SC at Nittawela grounds, kick of is at 4 pm. with Ajith Kumara handling the whistle.
Kandy is expected to start the second round with a comfortable win, in front of their home town fans.
They head into the game with plenty of confidence following the superb performance in the first round. They have one of the best forward packs in the competition, and their back line is packed with plenty of excellent performers and they could build on that performance in the game. Kandys attacking style of play helps to drive their ability to demolish opponents.
The pressure will be on the cops to perform. They have lost all the games and are last in the table.
The policemen are lacking the big names that are in the squads for some of the other teams, but they have a well-balanced, consistent outfit that could present with some issues in the first quarter of todays game. Policemen will go all out to present a strong team  especially in the forwards.
Whatever they do, they could struggle to cover the huge line of the opponents.

KANDY SPORTS ROUND UP :
Kandy - hub of Hill country sports
As another year comes to an end it is an appropriate time to take a look at sports development in Kandy. Over the years Kandy has established a proud record of having produced some of the top most sportsmen/sportswomen in the field of rugby, cricket, football, swimming, hockey, athletics, table tennis, iron sports, boxing, swimming, basketball, golf and recently baseball, which is a new sport that has been introduced. The sporting fraternity of Kandy hopes that Minister Lakshman Kiriella, a sports lover who is residing in Kandy, and keen to developing sports should help the young sportsmen and women by using his initiative to find solutions on how to provide better facilities for all sports in the district. He has plans to upgrade Bogambara stadium to international level. Although Kandy has several sports bodies they need to get actively involved at the highest levels. Kandys urgent need is proper ground facilities for cricket, hockey and athletics. During the time when the Bogambara Stadium was under the Municipal Council, sports flourished in Kandy. The respective sports bodies were able to pocket out the ground fee, but today the ground fee is sky high, more than what it was under the MC. The sporting fraternity of Kandy has appealed to the new Sports Minister to give a helping hand.
Rugby
Today the oval ball sport is undoubtedly the most popular in Kandy with one A division club Kandy Sports Club, which was founded in 1874 dominating as the reigning club champions in the league and knockout. This has boosted the sport in every corner of the district with all schools taking up to the game. Trinity, Kingswood, St. Anthony's, Dharmaraja, St. Sylvester's, Sri Sumangala, Sri Rahula, and Vidyartha have done well in schools rugby. Most of the Kandy club players represent the national team as well. Kandy SC is the kings of local rugby and this year too are close to maintaining that tag. The Kingswoodians won the all-island under 18 championships. Today there is a well-organised Academy called Kandy Rugby Academy which holds coaching sessions every Saturday morning at Bogambara Stadium to help youngsters.
Football
Football has been tagged the common man's game, at one time and was a powerhouse of Sri Lanka club football. But today it is in a forgotten state. When will the game of football regain its former glory in the historic city of Kandy Today no one seems to care for football in the hill capital which has a history of nearly 100 years. The game is sadly neglected. For many years, tournaments and AGMs have not been held on time in an organized manner. This has been a great setback to the sport. Sad to say in the last couple of years football has gone off side and most of the players are losing interest as there is no recognition nor any support or encouragement to take this game forward. At club level it is dead. The schools are playing the game as usual but overall Kandy football is dead and virtually buried.
Cricket
At school level the sport continues to take pride of place, though the club standards have dropped somewhat. Here again the contributing factor has been the lack of resources and facilities and poor organizing. This year the Kandy DCA and CPCA have brought in cricket promoters and they are doing their best. A few days back Kandy CC won the Central Province Governors trophy.
Hockey
In Kandy hockey at both boys and girls school level is quite healthy and successful, especially girls schools dominating the game. KDHA affairs at club level have been unsuccessful and non-operational. A herculean effort is urgently required if club hockey in Kandy is to see its former glory days. It is sad to note that hockey has taken a back seat at club level.
Cue Sport
Billiards and snooker have taken a nosedive with hardly any activity. It was a sport which was once dominated by Kandy clubs. Only Mahanuwara YMBA keeps the sport going, other clubs like Kandy Club, Kandy Garden Club, and Kandy YMMA have forgotten to switch the table lights. Now it is a parlor game. Only during the AGM of the controlling body, the lights come on.
Basketball
Basketball has got back to its former glory and recently Kandy conducted a very successful inter-district tournament. The schools are giving a big boost to restart the game in a better fashion. It was in 1964 that basketball was introduced. The first ever tournament in Kandy was held in1965 for men and women. In the early days Kandy YMCA gave a big hand.
Table Tennis
In Kandy this game was very popular. There is some hope as there are many schools and clubs who are capable of doing well. The late D.H de Silva when he was Municipal Commissioner gave good support. Today most of the schools are doing well, especially Vidyartha College. At one time Municipal Council gave a big hand for the sport through their community centers.
Badminton
There is somewhat a lack of interest in this sport. Something must be done to uplift the game.
There are not many coaches and should the schools take to the sport the game can pick up. In badminton Kandy has produced national level champions and continues to do so.
Lawn Tennis
One-time it was a very popular sport in Kandy. It was Kandy Lawn Cub, Kandy Garden Club, University of Peradeniya and Kandy Police who took to the sport during DIG Bodi Liyanage's time. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way.
Swimming
Mahamaya Girls have dominated the sport by winning many meets. Trinity and Hillwood Girls have also excelled in the water sport.
Boxing
This sport remains popular among the schools. One time king makers of the sport were Trinity College later St. Sylvester's College followed by Peradeniya MMV and Sarasavi Uyana. Of late schools like Vidyartha, Kingswsood and Dharmaraja, have taken to the sport and are doing well. In the good old days Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for boxing and helped the sport.
Wrestling
This sport was at its best at club level especially Kandy YMCA that promoted it. It is good to see Walala A Ratnayake Central doing well. They won the Junior Nationals recently.
Iron Sport
Kandy YMCA gave a big hand for iron sport (body building and weightlifting) and helped several iron sportsmen to do well and bring honor to the country.
Baseball
This sport is catching up fast, and some of the schools are keen to promote it thanks to the efforts of the promoters.
Golf
A sport which is popular mainly due to the promotion given by the Golf Club in Digana. They have tournaments that are well supported by sponsorships.
Volleyball
The sport is over 100 years old in the country and 77 years old in Kandy. It is the national sport, and at a certain time volleyball was a popular game. Today the much needed support is not there for the game. If the proper backing is given this game too, should be in the news.
Netball
Schools in Kandy are doing well in this sport and have taken part in most of the tournaments organized by the governing body.
It was Kandy Girls High School who started the sport first followed by Hillwood College.
Today most of the schools are in the game but with poor backing from the governing body.
Athletics
All schools in Kandy have athletics in their curriculum and are doing very well in this field.
At present all schools, boys and girls are performing well.
Sylvestrians produced a top athlete who represented the country in hurdles. Walala A. Ratnayake Central won several meets.
In the first three months of the year it is sports meet of all schools which is the most looked forward to sporting event where old boys and girls gather in camaraderie.
Cycling
Cycling has been popular in Kandy and there have been races on many occasions. For it to be competitive there has to be sponsorship which is lacking.
Chess
Chess has been popular at schools for quite a long period. Last year Trinity became All-Island champions.
Dharmaraja, Kingswood, Vidyartha, Sri Sumangala, St. Sylvester's and St. Anthony's did their best among the boy's schools. Mahamaya, Hillwood, High School, Pushpadana, Swarnamali, Hemamali and Seetha Devi did well in the girls tournaments.
Softball Cricket
It is very popular every Sunday and on public holidays when tournaments for various trophies are played. It is one of the most interesting and well represented sporting event by both sexes.
Carrom
A popular sport in Kandy, mostly played by the government departments.
This is a re-creation sport. Kandy's Carrom Association gives a big hand to promote the sport.
A N M Ameer who was attached to Sri Lanka Air Force was an outstanding carrom player who secured second place at the last Striker Cash Carrom Tournament where 112 competitors participated.
He is an old boy of St. Sylvesters College. Carrom today is promoted in a big way especially in schools.

Navy-CH will be a closely fought out battle
A closely fought out battle can be expected between high riding CH and FC and Navy Sports Club when they lock horns in their second round Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby encounter at the Navy grounds in Welisara today, kick off at 4.00pm.
CH and FC are packed with some outstanding players of the calibre of towering flankers Sasanka Ariyaratne and Yoshitha Rajapaksa along with cracking national players ex Peterites Lee Keegal and Anuradha Herath but they should get their act together if they are to pull off a win against the formidable sailors.
To achieve that the several national players who are in their ranks have to give off their best under their playmaker and fly half Samuel Maduwantha, the former St. Anthonys College rugby sensation.
Even though CH and FC are favourites to win, they are playing this match on Navys home grounds at Welisara; they will have stiff resistance from the Navy side. CH performed better beating CR & FC (19-12) and in their last three outings they had a closely fought out 21-all draw against Police SC at Police Park, a comprehensive runaway victory against Air Force SC by 43-31 at Air Force grounds in Ratmalana and a stunning 27-24 win against formidable Navy SC in their final first round game at Race Course grounds two weeks back.
Meanwhile the young Navy side at present under the leadership of experienced club player and captain Danushka Gertha Perera has already lost three games in the first round unexpectedly to CR & FC (23-38), CH and FC (24-27) and Kandy SC (19-33). Hence they will have to come out with all guns blazing to topple the CH team to avenge their first round defeat to them at Race Course grounds.
The teams:
CH and FC (Probable XV): Sathya Ranatunga, Ravin yapa, Terrence Henry, Matheesha Sarathchandra, Sajith Saranga, Sasanka Ariyaratne, Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Rohitha Rajapaksa (captain), Avishka Lee and Samuel Maduwantha, Dinushan Ariyapala, Lee Keegal, Rayan Weerakoon, Anurada Herath, Shamri Burah
Navy SC (Probable XV): Roshan Ranasinghe or Stefan Gregory, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Kasun De Silva, Supun Peiris, Lahiru Wishvajith, Adeesha Weeratunga, Danushka Gertha  Perera (captain), Janith Laksara, Richie Dharmapala and Mohamad Abzal, Buddhima Piyaratne, Lahiru Herath, Musheen Faleel, Supun Dilshan, Thilina Weerasinghe.

## Title: A New Year of  political discovery

A New Year of  political discovery
The fast approaching New Year will bring the most rivalrous political contest in the country since the campaign from November 2014 and the Presidential Election in January 2015. The present national leaders and the countrys leader in the immediate past are contestants in a campaign of national importance for the control of local government bodies in the country, which would lead to the larger scope of national politics in the coming years.
While the celebrations of Christmas and New Year would have pushed the campaigns back a little, they will emerge with colour and commitment displaying the realities of political conflict in the country, largely on the basis of the rivalry and differences between and among political parties, and regrettably with little purpose for the needs of the people who comprise the vast electorate.
As the rival parties make their initial moves in the campaign, many observers see that the thousands of candidates contesting for the many thousand seats in local bodies in the country have very few policies or concepts of service for the people through effective local government; but will campaign to show which party in the fray is the most popular. This applies mainly in the seven provinces outside the North and East, although even in those two provinces too, the play of the party and the politician is clearly of more importance than service to the people.
As the drum beat of politics takes more importance than the rhythm of service, we are seeing an increasing rivalry between the official SLFP led by President Maithripala Sirisena, and the lotus bud SLPP effectively led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which is clearly showing a campaign for the control of the SLFP or Blue voters in the country, much more than any policies with regard to local government.
This is certainly posing major questions to the strength and policy formulations of the coalition of unity that controls the Central Government, with attempts by the SLFP members in key positions in government seeking to move away from their coalition ally  the UNP, in moves that seek to give more support to the SLPP and the leadership of Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The contradictory position of President Sirisena being the leader of the SLFP that is openly challenging the national leader he defeated, largely with UNP support, in January 2015, and the failure of efforts by President Sirisena and his SLFP Ministers in the coalition of unity to achieve any understanding with the SLPP and the Joint Opposition (JO) that is its main political front, have certainly placed the government in a visibly shaky position  because of threats to the continued unity between the UNP and SLFP in the coalition of unity in governance. The emerging campaign rhetoric of the formal (pro-Sirisena) SLFP that is hugely anti-UNP, with the identification of the UNP as the Common Enemy' going back to the traditional rivalries of the past, and the allegations of corruption, especially with the Central Bank and Treasury bond issues, certainly places the unity government in a shaky position as the campaign gets hotter.
More to follow
The release of the Presidential Commission Report on the Treasury bond issues will certainly be a major campaign issue in an election said to be concerned with local government and not Treasury bonds. The findings of the Commission, if in keeping with or even more than the evidence led before it, will certainly be a major concern for the UNP, with issues of conflict of interest and individual and official corruption already exposed, placing it in a situation that needs a big fight back. The reality is that both the SLFP and the SLPP will be making capital of this in the poll campaign, with the belief that the maximum distance from the UNP in this situation is the best for both parties- for Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa.
After the efforts to have some unity between the SLFP and SLPP in the campaign having failed, the SLFP leaders are now talking about a unity of purpose, of forming alliances with the SLPP where there is such possibility the post-election situation. This will of course depend on how strong either party performs in the election. As the campaign moves on the common enemy strategy against the UNP will have to be pushed back by both Blues, because it will almost lead to an infighting on a single slogan, which ultimately helps the UNP.
It is necessary to record here that many of the SLFP leaders who are trying their best to distance themselves from the UNP today, who are trying to distance themselves from the common enemy  UNP, were those who crept back to the political and government leadership of Maithripala Sirisena, after the August 2015 General Election, and many of them were also defeated in the polls but came in as Nominated MPs who did not have the mandate of the people.
There present political strategies are decidedly shameless, when considering the fact that Maithripala Sirisenas election as Executive President, defeating Mahinda Rajapaksa, was entirely due to the block UNP vote in January 2015, and their creeping in also followed the majority of 105 seats the UNP won in August 2015. This shameless politics of the position and power hunters is showing the depths to which Sri Lankan politics has descended in the last few decades, and especially in and after the Rajapaksa Regime, and will need much more than a huge local government election in the current context and strategies for politics in Sri Lanka to be concerned with issues and not people and power.
While the opposition to the UNP will be the key aspect of political rivalry in the coming month of campaigning, those who make increasing noise against the UNP should also understand that the SLFP and SLPP (plus JO) will not be able to form a government, that can have more parliamentary seats than the UNP and its allies  such as the TNA and some Muslim political parties.
The UNP thus moves into this campaign as the strongest political party, with its Green Flag having unbroken support among its membership throughout the country, and will remain undivided, especially in the context of being the strong part of a coalition government, and holding the key portfolios, after more than two decades of being out of power.
Despite the many disadvantages on corruption, especially on the Treasury bond issues, and possibly with a new Presidential Commission to probe the failures of SriLankan Airways, the nature of politics in the country today, with power preceding policy, and the crooked nature of governance dominating the political system, certainly places the UNP at a major advantage in a political system that is not emphasizing on the fight against corruption, but more on the power of party and personality, which pays little attention to a policy of service to the people. This is not the best situation for the UNP to be in, but it is the reality of the politics of today, which will need much more than a hugely manipulated local government poll to resolve.
The way forward
The coming local government poll has certainly moved to become an election of national importance, as it comes at almost the middle of the current governments term. It will make a major contribution to give an indication of how far the present coalition of unity could go in the coming years. It will also be an indicator of the future political strategies of President Maithripala Sirisena, who on the day of his swearing in said this would be his only term in the Presidency, the key dictatorial conditions of which he would remove. Some of that has been done, but there is much more needed, which will need constitutional changes, which are not the highlight of today.
It is also an election that will be of importance in future policies of the UNP, the role of its leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, and its commitment to the policies of liberal democracy which is being strongly criticized as being much more pro-capitalism and very little by way of liberalism. It is also an election that will show what opportunities Ranil Wickremesinghe may have in a campaign for an Executive Presidency. It is also a poll that will show how far the Rajapaksa name has been weakened or strengthen in the politics of the country, and whether Mahinda Rajapaksa could move to be the next Prime Minister, and if so who would be the President he would have to serve under.
All this is the unknown politics of the future, and more importantly the realities of politics that the people of Sri Lanka would have to face up to in the coming months and years. It is a local government poll that is flying many kites in the emerging strong winds of rival politics, and hopefully policies, too. It will be a New Year of political discovery.

President tells SLFP LG poll Candidates:
No room for corrupt politicians
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday, requested the new SLFP candidates contesting the Local Government elections to become exemplary political leaders.
The President during his address to the candidates, stated that corrupt politicians were the main stumbling block to a developed and prosperous Sri Lanka, referring to them as apalaya (ill luck).
President Sirisena pointed out that most of the politicians in Sri Lanka are involved in fraud, corruption and other malpractices, which deter the countrys development.
The President said he requires future political leaders to give priority to spiritual development in the country and economic development.
President Sirisena was addressing SLFP candidates contesting the upcoming Local Government elections at a ceremony held at Sugathadasa Stadium yesterday.
This country needs politicians who pledge for clean politics, the President added.
We go to newly developed countries such as Singapore, Malaysia and Korea and complain that our country has not reached the same level of development. Our country does not have a dearth of academics, scientists, researchers or natural resources.
With all these resources, why are we lagging behind as a country There is a secret behind this. The sad truth behind this plight is that our politicians of all levels do not do what they promise to do. They have their own personal agendas. They pay no heed for people and their betterment. President Sirisena pointed out.
No politician, in whatever the level from the bottom to top, should have personal agendas, President Sirisena also pointed out.
The only agenda the politicians should have is for their country and its people, he also pointed out.
President Sirisena also pointed out that Sri Lanka no more needs politicians who are corrupt and use their political power to fulfill their own political agendas.
We need politicians who love this country and its people. We need politicians who do not look for financial advantages. We need politicians who do not misuse and destroy public money and public property. We no longer need politicians who use political power for their own selfish achievements, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena also pointed out that many political parties have taken corruption free politics as a motto in their election campaigns. This tendency itself shows that what we lack in Sri Lanka itself is corruption free politics. We promise it because we do not have it. We have a very long way to go.
The SLFP has selected educated and clean young candidates at this election. I request all of our candidates to refrain from criticising your political opponents at your election campaigns. Instead, speak to your supporters about your vision for a developed village and a prosperous country. President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena pointed out that he will give the leadership of the SLFP to the new political leaders of the party and not to his family members.

Pakistan to send 40,000 MT of fertiliser
Pakistan has agreed to send 40,000 metric tonnes of fertilizer to Sri Lanka immediately, President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said.
President Sirisena said that he immediately contacted Pakistan Prime Minister Shahid Khaqan Abbasi, following concerns raised on the scarcity of fertiliser in the country and requested assistance to find an immediate solution to the matter. I have now received information that the Pakistani government has responded positively to my request. Accordingly, 40,000 metric tonnes of fertiliser will soon reach Sri Lanka, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena was speaking at a ceremony held at the Sugathadasa Stadium with the participation of Local Government election candidates of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance.
President Sirisena further said, Some groups ask me as to what I did during the last three years. There was a recent temporary ban on our tea imposed by Russia. I requested Russian President Vladimir Putin in writing to look into the matter. He responded immediately and lifted the ban.
This is the kind of international relationship that we have developed in last few years, the President said.
I participated in a conference held in Qatar recently where several Memoranda of Understanding were signed between the two countries. Within 24 hours following my visit, a group of Qatari representatives visited Sri Lanka, President Sirisena said. The Qatari government has informed me of their willingness to fund the development of any city in Sri Lanka.
They have requested us to name any city in Sri Lanka for them to implement the development project. This is the kind of international cooperation we have developed in the last few years. There is a whole list of similar offers of assistance from countries around the globe for Sri Lankan government, President Sirisena pointed out. The UPFA candidates competing at the next Local Government election made the Pledge for Freedom for Good Governance free of fraud and corruption at the ceremony as well.

The right to know the truth
Apparently, one study conducted by a social study group has shown that most Lankan people in general, irrespective of nationality are open-minded of learning about the past. In Lanka, all have gone through difficult periods under terror of insurgents and security forces. On the one hand there is a big divide in the knowledge about other communities, even those living in their midst but are from different nationality and religious communities, and even more so when they live in different parts of the country.
There is a strong interest in learning about the other side of the truth which is a special feature of Sri Lanka. They know there is controversy about it and would like to know the truth. This also applies to most members of the security forces. They know they are under a cloud and would like to clear their names.
In the preparation of local government elections these attitudes came into lime light. Everywhere, the parties that accept equality have attracted youth. There are such parties led by Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim political activists. Despite many years of national and inter religious conflicts, most people do not wish to keep hate or have any conflicts with those from other communities.
One of the salient features of the ongoing village political mobilization is that people at the community and political level go out of their way to try and include those of other nationality and religions, in the decision making committees they form. Civil society groups and political activists have found that people today at all levels, and all sectors, including the government bureaucracy, security forces and religious clergy are glad to meet to dialogue and to solve problems together. This is an improvement of social and cultural features of Lanka that represent the modernization of the society.
Racism and fascistic agitation
The Joint Opposition has re-started to spouse racism and fascistic agitation. As usual Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe will avoid confrontation at this time too, for reasons of electoral politics. Some hope that after the conclusion of the local government elections on February 10 a new window of opportunity will open for reconciliation. Victory of radical democracy may compel the government to carry out the promises made to the people. Delivering on its promise of ascertaining and clarifying the truth needs to be a priority.
After a long delay local elections are scheduled on February 10, 2018. According to the officials nearly 16 million persons will be voting at these elections. No doubt this will be the largest election in Lankan history. Luckily elections are held under the new system. The manape misery has been removed and these will also be the first elections under the mixed electoral system whereby 60% of members will be elected using first-past-the-post voting and the remaining 40% through closed list proportional representation.
However, as usual the turnover could be less than 70% and official anticipation is that the turnout of the electorate will be much less than previous ones. The last local government elections held in 2011 saw a voter turnout of 65 percent. However this time around the figure cannot be much less, looking at the political debates taking place. There is a stronger degree of voter attachment with the radical political parties.
Local government elections
In Lanka local government has a history which goes into the beginning of civilization. The name Gemunu originates from village authority and refers to the village leader or the chairman of the village council.
The Elara, Gemunu conflict was based on the powers of the central government and the village council in the periphery. In reality it was a socio-economic conflict between two systems. Elara stood for strong village authority that controls the village tank and water management. Gemunu stood for Asiatic state based on organised water management. Power of the village council is weak in relation to the central government. Buddhism backed the centralization of power with an organised clergy or Sangha. Later village culture reemerged as the centralized irrigations broke down and it continued under the colonial powers. British recognized the power of village council and they revived it with the support of local aristocratic authority while getting their support to the central colonial administration.
Today the local government elections are most important to the village and ward level political activist. In fact it was claimed that the 1971 insurrection indirect protest against postponement of local government elections. Therefore, the issues at local elections are usually not local ones, but national issues which are of more interest to the voters. This election will be no exception. The opposition in particular has been trying to induce voters to see the forthcoming local government elections as being of national significance. In particular the defeated fascistic political movement is raising the division of the country issue as the main item in the political debate.
New constitution
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is heading the so-called Joint Opposition campaign has clearly stated that this election will not be about local issues but whether the people want to support or oppose the government and proposed new constitution. Also he makes the accusation that the government has not delivered on its promises to welfare of the masses.
At these elections, the parties forming the government will be disadvantaged by the slowness of their performance in delivering on the promises made at the national elections that took place in 2015. The voter turnout at the last general elections in 2015 at which change for the better was the promise, was 78 percent.
The governments main campaign promises in addition to resolving the Tamil national problem and improving human rights conditions, were with regard to quick results in economic betterment for the masses and to meting out justice to those accused of large scale corruption.
These promises galvanized the electorate. Some say that the irony in this campaign is to see the hunter becoming the hunted. Those accused of large scale corruption in the former government have sought to become hunters. However the fascistic forces are well exposed.That has forced Mahinda Rajapaksa to go slow at the beginning; but he has nothing to deliver except brutal racist clashes.

Satirizing the news in the age of Donal Trump
US: Absurdity and exaggeration, the two key ingredients of political satire, are no longer as effective in the age of Donald Trump and fake news -- something that is forcing comedians and talk show hosts to adapt their craft to get a laugh.
News parody outlets such as The Onion, The Flipside, The Borowitz Report and a whole slew of others have all made a name for themselves by twisting the news to give it a humorous edge, openly mocking reality.
The formula worked as a counterpoint to real news, but with the advent of Trump's Twitter account and the explosion of fake news sites, the lines have become blurred.
The absurdity of our reality has completely outpaced anything the imagination could come up with, said Andy Borowitz, who has been writing The Borowitz Report since 2001.
So it would be futile for me to outdo the absurdities of our current situation, he added.
I'm really more or less transcribing what is happening. And perhaps giving a slightly more blunt or unvarnished view, he said.
For all that, the need for people to laugh is even more pronounced than ever because, he said, the situation we find ourselves in is so dire.
However, he notes that under Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, the work had been more challenging for satirists since the economy was improving and we had didn't have any scandal at the White House and we had a president who was widely respected around the world, and was improving America's image around the world.
In the age of fake news, he makes sure his column -- which now runs on The New Yorker's website -- is clearly labeled as satire and runs in the humour section, lest anyone mistake his jokes for actual reporting.
It's very clear that we're not trying to fool anybody. We're not trying to commit a hoax, he said.
That is not the case with Christopher Blair, the mysterious figure behind a series of satirical websites such as The Last Line of Defense (thelastlineofdefense.online), which have attracted a lot of attention over the past year.
He told AFP that his sites were clearly marked as satire, but a number of fact-checking websites have disputed that claim, and some have criticized him for peddling fake news for financial gain.
In March, one of his articles claiming that an arrest warrant had been issued for Obama was picked up by dozens of other sites which presented it as real news.
Blair defends his position, maintaining that it is clear to most people, and that he has been seeking to target specific topics that we know will draw the worst the right has to offer into the public, so that they find themselves humiliated in front of their families and friends.
We've had pages taken down, posts removed, racists banned forever, said Blair, describing his work less as comedy than as a targeted liberal troll op.
That is a long way from the straight-up political satire of the past, and frankly on the very fringes of parody, even though satirists try to do more than simply raise a laugh.
At the heart of all of our satire is a kernel of truth, Cole Bolton, then still the editor-in-chief of the Onion, said last May in an interview with the Vermont newspaper Seven Days.
And we want people to see it; we want it to click for them and [for them to] see there's a clever insight that we're making, said Bolton, who quit his job in September.
And if we don't do that, we're not being satirists, we're being tricksters, he said.
So, if people are believing it, then we haven't done our jobs. Or they're just spectacular idiots.

SLPA employee goes for Guinness World Record
Janaka Kanchana Mudannayaka, a Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) employee set a Guinness World Record yesterday for carrying 17 bags of flour weighing 50 kgs each within a 30 minute time period.
He achieved his feat by carrying the bags of flour with his mouth for a distance of 30 metres in the presence of a panel of observers.
It was Mudannayakas third Guinness World Record.
After completing the Guinness World Record yesterday, Mudannayaka said that his aim is to bring fame to Sri Lanka by setting 18 Guinness World Records, surpassing that of his late father, who also set seven Guinness World Records.
Mudannayaka attempted the Guinness World Record in the presence of the panel of observers and a large gathering of well-wishers including Social Empowerment Welfare Minister S.B. Dissanayake.
However, Mudannayaka who attempted to carry two more bags of flour close to the 30 metre distance failed to go beyond the finish line.
As he was unable to pass the line these two attempts were not considered for the world record.
Addressing media, Mudannayaka further said the video clips and other certified documents of the observers will be submitted to the Guinness World Record Committee for their approval.
Mudannayaka who is attached to the Jaya Container Terminal (JCT) Prime-mover Maintenance Department of the SLPA plans to set another two more world records at the grand finale of Youths With Talents programme, jointly organised by the Sri Lanka Youth Council and Independent Television Network (ITN) scheduled to be held in March next year.
Minister Dissanayake said that youths of Mudannayakas calibre should be motivated and encouraged to bring fame to the country.
He praised Mudannayaka for bringing honour and glory to the country. On an earlier occasion, an attempt by Mudannayaka to set a Guinness World Record by allowing 10 double cabs to drive over his stomach failed as he was unprepared when the third vehicle drove over his stomach.

Christmas was celebrated at the Sri Lankan High Commission in Canberra, Australia with the participation of the Sri Lankan community on December 16.
Rev. Father Kevin Harris delivered blessings and a message highlighting the true meaning of Christmas. He referred to the modest surroundings in which Baby Jesus was born as a reminder to all of humanity.
A multi-ethnic multi-religious group of colourfully dressed Choristers representing the Australia-Sri Lanka Association and the Canberra Tamil Christian Fellowship sang carols in unison in Sinhala, Tamil and English, joined by the High Commission staff.
The audience rose to their feet in singing together the final carol for the evening, the famous Silent Night with lyrics of the first two verses in Sinhala and Tamil and the final two in English.
The High Commissioner said it was a perfect way to bring to a close a most eventful year in our diplomatic relations with Australia and in community events at the Mission. The rendering of carols in all three languages, he said, was in itself a blessing and the way forward to peace and harmony.
The High Commissioner in his remarks referred to these moments as being very special, and thanked Rev. Father Harris, the choristers, the musicians and the gathering for their contribution in making the celebration a true Christmas blessing.

Supun steers CR to stunning 24-17 win
A young CR & FC rugby team led by their inspirational hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya who was down with high fever on the morning of the match but decided to play dished out a superb brand of open rugby together with the entire team to come from behind and stun Army SC by 24 points (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 17 (2 tries, 2 conversions, 1 penalty) in their Dialog A division inter-club league rugby match second round played at Havelock Park yesterday.
The scores were deadlocked 10-all at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. CR & FC drew first blood when their reliable fly half cum vice-captain Tharinda Ratwatte slotted in a 35 meter penalty to go into a 3-nil lead. Army scored through flanker Pushpakumara who crashed through for a try and Salinda made the conversion for Army to lead 7-3.
Army SC scored again through the boot of Salinda when he slotted in a penalty to increase the scoreline to 10-3. CR and FC equalled the score when their granite number eight Omalka Gunaratne crashed through for a superb try. Tharinda made the conversion and the score read 10-all at half time.
Soon after the break hooker Supun Warnakulasuriya went over the line for a spectacular try after collecting the ball off a maul. Tharinda put over the conversion and CR & FC went into a 17-10 lead.
The red shirts scored again to increase their lead when off a fine three quarter move the ball changed several hands and to their speedy winger and captain Kavindu Perera who burst through and dived over under the post for a superb try. Tharinda made an easy conversion for the score to read 24-10 in favour of CR.
In the final stages of play Army scored a consolation try when their centre Bulathsinghala joined the line off a sweeping three quarter move and darted down to score a try All Blacks style which probably is one of the best scored this season. Full back Gayan Salinda made the conversion and the final score read 24-17 in favour of CR & FC.
HAVIES WIN
In another Dialog A division match played yesterday, Havelock SC scored a bonus points win over Air Force SC by 34 points (3 goals, 2 tries, 1 penalty) to 18 (1 goal, 1 try, 2 penalties) at Air Force grounds Ratmalana. At half time Havies led 17-7.

Tension escalates in North East Asia
Russia and China are concerned about increased involvement of the United States in North East Asia, particularly in the Korean peninsula and Japan. It was few weeks ago that the United States, South Korea and Japan held joint military drills in the Korean peninsula escalating tensions that were already high on account of the ballistic missile and nuclear development programme of North Korea.
The United States and North Korea have been engaged in a bitter war of words, threatening each other almost throughout 2017. The United States has vowed to use all options including war to end North Koreas nuclear development programme, the latter has defiantly continued it unabated claiming its right to do so as an independent state. Apparently North Korean leader Kim Jon-un has astutely decided to arm the country with a nuclear deterrent so as not to be bullied by the United States. Obviously he must be aware that a policy of appeasement or submission to Washington dictates would earn him and the country the same fate that befell President Muammer Khadafi and Libya.
Though both Russia and China have agreed to UN Sanctions on North Korea for its continuation of the nuclear programme, they are likely to defend North Korea in any military confrontation in the peninsula. Moreover, both of them see United States military presence in the region as a threat to their security.
Meanwhile, a new confrontation is developing as a result of Japan's plans to deploy more US missile systems. It was only last week that Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe agreed to buy two US-built Aegis Ashore missile defense systems.
Besides the Aegis system, Washington has equipped Tokyo with Patriot and Terminal High Altitude Defense System (THAAD) missile systems. They are also working on a jointly developed ship-based missile interceptor called the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 (SM-3) that will be used with the Aegis system.
Actions like these are in direct contradiction to the priority of building military and political trust between Russia and Japan, and, unfortunately, will impact in a negative way on the whole atmosphere in bilateral relations, including negotiations over the peace treaty problem, Russian Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said on Thursday.
This decision by Tokyo causes deep regrets and major concerns.
We see this move by Japan as running counter to efforts to ensure peace and stability in the region, she went on. Such actions by Tokyo are directly at variance with the priority task to build trust in the military-political sphere between Russia and Japan and will negatively influence the general atmosphere in bilateral relations, including negotiations on a peace treaty, she added.
No matter what arguments and motives are cited to explain it [the decision], it is clear that the deployment of the above mentioned systems is yet another move towards creating a full-value Asian-Pacific regional segment of the US global missile defense system, Zakharova said.
President Donald Trump in his United States National Security Strategy outlined on December 18 named both Russia and China as revisionist powers, meaning adversaries who want to challenge US supremacy. It is also clear that he considers both countries as economic enemies.
This is in a situation which the economic and political power of the United States is on the wane in contrast to the ascendant nature of the economic position of China and Russia in todays world.
Zuma faces impeachment
Constitutional Court of South Africa was to meet yesterday to compel parliament to launch impeachment proceedings against President Jacob Zuma over a scandal related to state-funded upgrades to his private home.
Deputy President Cyril Ramaphosa was elected leader of Zumas ruling African National Congress (ANC) last week defeating Zumas nominee. In March 2016, the court ruled that Zuma pay back some of the roughly $15 million in state money spent upgrading his private home.
India-China hold border talks
Special Representatives of Indian and Chinese Presidents, National Security Adviser Ajit Doval and State Councilor Yang Jiechi respectively met in New Delhi for border talks on December 22.
This was the first such meeting following the resolution of the armed skirmishes between the two countries in Doklam last year.
This meeting is a sequel to the meeting between Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Chinese President Xi Jinping this year. No doubt it was guided by the Modi-Xi agreements of 2017, including the Astana consensus that differences must not be allowed to become disputes, and the understanding at Xiamen that India-China relations are a factor of stability in an increasingly unstable world.
The discussions followed the Agreement on Political Parameters and Guiding Principles for the Settlement of the India-China Boundary Question in 2005. They may have gone beyond border issues. Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesperson Hua Chunying said on Tuesday prior to the start of the talks The SR meeting is not only a high-level channel for the border issue discussion but also the platform for strategic communication."

The World in 2017
This year was a very challenging one for the entire world, with political, climatic and societal upheavals in many countries. The most transformative event of 2017 was the swearing-in of real estate tycoon Donald Trump as the President of the United States, which would have been unthinkable just a few years ago.
President Trump has since challenged the existing world order with controversial decisions and statements on climate change, immigration, trade, diplomacy, defence and race relations. His most controversial decision was recognizing Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, which has been opposed at the UN Security Council and the General Assembly even by some of the closest allies of the US. With Trump at the helm, 2018 will remain an equally hot year for the US and the rest of the world.
Trump was not the only new personality to enter the world stage in 2017. France saw the ascension of Emmanuel Macron (39) to the Presidency and New Zealand saw Jacinda Arden (37) in the Premiers seat. Leo Varadkar became the Irish PM at age 38 in 2017. But Austrias Sebastian Kurz beat them all to the title of the worlds youngest leader at just 31. On the other end of the scale, the worlds oldest leader Robert Mugabe was finally ousted at age 93 and replaced by Emmerson Mnangagwa.
World leaders in 2017 promised to fight and annihilate the ISIS terror group and we have indeed seen significant progress on this front. ISIS has been driven away from many of their previous bastions. The next year will be a decisive one for the battle against terrorism as 2017 witnessed several terrorist atrocities mainly in Europe. The US saw one of the deadliest shooting incidents in recent memory as a gunman mowed down more than 50 partygoers in Florida in October.
If there is anything that can create more havoc than terrorism, it is nature. Changing climatic patterns were very much on show in 2017, with hurricanes Maria, Harvey and Jose devastating many parts of the US and Caribbean. Several Asian and South American countries too were hit by heavy rains and floods. There is clear evidence that the worlds climate patterns are changing due to Mans activities.
North Korea was also in the news, thanks to its nuclear and missile programmes. North Korean Leader Kim Jong-un has continued these programmes in defiance of UN sanctions and international condemnation. Some commentators have been alarmed by the rhetoric of US and North Korean leaders which they say could trigger World War III. Tougher sanctions have been imposed on North Korea for the moment.
The world watched the results of two referendums in 2017. In Britain, Article 50 was triggered, which would eventually end the UKs membership of the European Union. However, the process has remained moribund since then, with some commentators wondering whether Brexit will happen at all. In Spain, separatists in Catalonia claimed victory in a referendum on independence, only for the Central Government in Madrid to step in and take over. An overwhelming majority of countries sided with Spain on this issue, leaving the separatists in the lurch.
The Rohingya refugee crisis in Myanmar and Bangladesh also received plenty of attention, as did the plight of 165,000 migrants who tried to cross the Mediterranean to enter Europe in 2017. More than 3,000 of them perished in the sea as their rickety boats capsized in rough seas. The conflict and famine in Yemen was another incident that saddened the world.
Time Magazine had chosen women who broke the silence over sexual harassment as Person of the Year, as the MeToo tag took Twitter by storm. Movie mogul Harvey Weinstein was the first to be accused, while a stream of other big names from Kevin Spacey to Charlie Rose also came to the fore. This can be termed as a turning point in the battle against sexual harassment all over the world.
It was not all gloom and doom in 2017. A lost Leonardo Da Vinci painting known as Salvator Mundi sold for an astounding US$ 450 million at an auction. Its destination has now been revealed as the newly opened Louvre Abu Dhabi.
This year, the world said goodbye to the space probe Cassini, which had amassed thousands of images of Saturn over the years. Ground controllers ordered the robotic probe to destroy itself over those beautiful rings of Saturn. But scientists have probed even further and found many Exoplanets in 2017 that could perhaps harbour or support life.
But if you think saving life on Earth is more important, this year was a breakthrough year for Gene Therapy which involves modifying a persons DNA to treat or prevent deadly diseases. Several gene therapies were approved for the first time this year to treat blindness, lymphoma and leukemia.
A healthier, better and more equal world is our hope for 2018, where the rich should use some of their collective US$ 5 trillion wealth for the welfare of the poor and all should join hands to protect our only home, Planet Earth.

AGs Dept. fails to respond regarding 97 files - FCID
Sources within the Financial Crimes Investigations Department (FCID), report that 97 files sent to the Attorney Generals (AG) Department for advice on further action had not returned with a reply. As a result many officers many complain that they are wasting their time with nothing to do.
Officers remarked that if a response from the AGs Department had been given, they would have been able to take all necessary legal action against those responsible.
The FCID has received over 500 complaints regarding large scale fraud and of that number, 300 are being investigated into.
Among these cases, the cases regarding the assets of certain individuals have been handed over to the Commission to Investigate Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) or other relevant agencies.
CIABOC however has no authority to investigate cases regarding money laundering and thus these cases were sent to the FCID. These are among the files completed and handed over to the AGs Department, it was learnt. The officers hoped that they would receive a reply regarding these files by at least early next year.

Antibiotic use in poultry feed to be phased out from 2018
Sri Lanka will, next year, look to further regulate and phase out antibiotic growth promoters used in poultry feed in an effort to combat antimicrobial resistance in the country.
An official at the Department of Animal Production and Health explained that they, together with specialists dealing with human health, animal health, fisheries and agriculture have worked as a team to develop the National Strategic Plan for Combating Antimicrobial Resistance in Sri Lanka 2017  2022 and thus, one of the measures taken in the animal husbandry industry would be to reduce and phase out antibiotic growth promoters used in animal feed and poultry production.
This is part of the WHO initiative to have its member countries develop national action plans to combat the global issue of humans developing antibiotic resistance as a result of its overuse in all sectors of our lives.
The current antibiotic growth promoters used in chicken feed especially are not harmful to human health but these are part of a measure to reduce the overall use of antibiotics in our system. This would help in reducing the risk of antibiotic resistance among people, said the official.
Antibiotic growth promoters are used to describe any medicine that destroys or inhibits bacteria in chicken and is administered at a low, subtherapeutic dose.
The Department is currently working on gazetting an overall ban but until then, the official said, they had decided to stop issuing licenses for the import of these antibiotic growth promoters from next year.
We hope to have a ban in place within next year, said the official.
The official explained that a complete ban could not be imposed immediately as they needed to give time, especially to small-scale farmers to adapt to better housing and biosecurity practices in their farm - thus removing the need for antibiotics.
At present, the government allows the use of three types of antibiotic growth promoters in the country under strict conditions.

Unable to suffer the indignity caused to him, he had decided to contest under an independent group, he said addressing a propaganda rally held at Thunduwe recently.
Ratnapala said many multi millionaire businessmen and the public had promised to support him at the forthcoming elections. After winning the elections, he would rejoin the SLPP (Pohottuwa party) along with other winning candidates of his group and appoint a chairman of their choice on condition that he be appointed vice-chairman.
He sad, in this way, he would hold the remote control of appointing the future chairman of the Bentota Pradesheeya Sabha. Ven. Mawathawatte Chandana Thera presided. Bentota Pradesheeya Sabhahaformer member Cyril Gunasekera spoke.

David Steele in 1975
A dead-rubber victory has greater tokenistic than tangible value. A morale restorative at the conclusion of an arduous series deceives in the flattery of figures and the illusion that the defeated side had finally, if too late, found the measure of a persistently superior opponent. On rare occasions  Centurion 2000 before evidence of Hansie Cronjes sickening collusion in corruption was uncovered  it offers hope, a sign of spring, foundations on which to build afresh. Usually, though, it serves as a consolation prize, a source of ephemeral, ultimately unimportant solace, a meaningless quirk considered by history with the same contempt Les Dawson reserved for a Blankety Blank chequebook and pen.
The sixth Test between Australia and England at Melbourne in 1975 was one such inconsequential triumph, giving England comfort after their spirits and bodies had been broken by Dennis Lillee, Jeff Thomson, Max Walker and the bats of Doug Walters, Ian and Greg Chappell. The tourists won by an innings and four runs to lose the series 4-1, the captain, Mike Denness, adding 188 in his ninth innings to the 130 he had managed in his previous eight during his second Test back after dropping himself at the SCG for poor form.
Keith Fletcher, who had been mercilessly targeted after encouraging Tony Greig to bounce Lillee at the Gabba, made 146. At Sydney Fletcher had gloved a vicious lifter from Thomson to defend his cheekbone and deflected it on to the badge of his MCC touring cap, an embroidered image of Englands patron saint slaying the dragon, from where it ricocheted towards cover. Only profound surprise dulling his reactions prevented Ross Edwards from running forward to catch Fletcher out. Blimey! said Geoff Arnold from the safety of the dressing room. St George has been knocked off his orse!
Thomson was ruled out of the last Test with a sore shoulder and Lillee pulled up lame with a trapped nerve in a foot after six overs. Three of Englands four century partnerships of the series took place after Lillee had hobbled off. When the cats away pertains all the more when the felines are a pair of sabre-toothed tigers and the mice scampered to a comfortable victory, then convalesced by defeating New Zealand 1-0 in a two-Test series, with hundreds for Denness and Dennis Amiss and a double for Fletcher before heading home.
At Lords the inquest into Englands humiliation drew the blood of the three members of the selection committee under the chairman, Alec Bedser. Ossie Wheatley, Jack Bond and Brian Taylor, county stalwarts but without a Test cap to share between them, were asked to take the honourable course and were replaced by Sir Leonard Hutton, Ken Barrington and Charlie Elliott. The new panel was split two-two over Dennesss reappointment but, despite his technical flaws against fast bowling and his traumatic loss of confidence, Bedsers casting vote gave him the captaincy for the Prudential World Cup and the opening match of four Tests against Australia, the first back-to-back series since 1911-12 as everyone nudged up a year to make sure 1975  notionally a year for the visit of South Africa  did not have to emulate 1970 and require a summons into the breach for a scratch Rest of the World party.
Tony Greig in top form
The heir apparent, Tony Greig, began the season in extraordinary nick and on the eve of the World Cup had a phenomenal four days against Warwickshire, scoring 226 and 71 in the Championship match and an unbeaten 108 in the John Player League game on the Sunday between the first and second days. When the tournament began England were barely tested by India (thanks to Sunil Gavaskars perverse go-slow), East Africa and New Zealand in qualifying for the semi-final where they again came up against Australia.
Denness top-scored with 27 in a total of 93 on a typical bowlers paradise at Headingley. Gary Gilmour, the fourth seamer, hooped it about on a green pitch to take six for 12 and then, when Australias top order had been skittled to leave them 39 for six, made a run-a-ball 28 to take them home. Australia were defeated in the final by West Indies, a match made memorable by Clive Lloyd scoring a superb hundred, Vivian Richards fielding like a vengeful dervish and Thomson and Lillee digging in for a thrilling last-wicket partnership bedevilled by premature crowd invasions in the midsummer twilight.
Bedser, who refused to take Englands best fast bowler, John Snow, on tour, was persuaded by his fellow selectors to stomach his presence at home, making him one of two additions to the touring party for the first Ashes Test of the summer at Edgbaston. Snow had not played for England for two years. The other recruit was called up to play his debut after scoring 75 for MCC against Australia in early July, an innings in which he hooked Thomson and Gilmour for sixes and clumped Lillee through cover in that oddly forceful but diffident manner that became so familiar over the next 20 years. At the age of 21 Graham Gooch became the youngest batsman picked for England since Colin Cowdrey was sent on the first of six Ashes tours in 1954.
Gooch remembers that the rest of the squad were stand-offish when they met the day before the match, no one speaking of tactics or even bothering to welcome him into the fold. When he went to the bar after the traditional eve of Test dinner, his team-mates were nowhere to be seen. He joined a demoralised, apprehensive and fatalistic side. When Denness won the toss the following morning and took 10 minutes with his council of senior players to tell the umpires what England would do, it is not surprising that interpretations of his decision to bowl were more psychological than meteorological. It was an overcast morning and the pitch had enough emerald strands to suggest it would reward the bowlers but more than anything the insertion suggested the captain wanted to postpone the ordeal as long as possible.
Denness must go
Where Denness saw green, his critics discerned yellow. Australia finished the day on 243 for five and the Daily Express summed up the lack of faith in the captain with its headline on the Friday: Denness must go. Even the Spectator pitched in, referring to the captains manifest inadequacy and when Gooch bagged a pair and England were bowled out twice on a damp pitch after the predicted rain arrived to make the uncovered wicket treacherous and lost by an innings and 85 runs, the poster on the newspaper sellers stands outside the ground demanded Denness must go.
The captains tone of voice betrayed him during the post-match interview. He was characteristically civil and thoughtful, his tartan trews and club tie making him look as well as sound like a stretched Ronnie Corbett. He had already offered his resignation but played a straight bat, saying his future was not his to decide. Greig was the frontrunner in the successor stakes but there were also advocates for a Churchillesque hour-of-need recall to the colours for the 44-year-old Brian Close or the 43-year-old Raymond Illingworth.
Hampshires Richard Gilliat was also a candidate for the crisis-requires-public-school-educated-new-broom school, the same voices who gave us Chris Cowdreys preposterous Lady-Jane-Grey reign 13 years later. The selectors, fortunately, followed the Australian model and gave it to Greig who, in the absence of Geoffrey Boycott, was demonstrably the best player. After Greig became a pariah to establishment eyes by joining World Series Cricket, it was almost taboo to acclaim his brilliance as a player: indeed as he forged a career in insurance and the media following his early retirement, it was difficult to get even him to talk about it. His critics would concede that he had a genius only for self-promotion and making money but they overlooked the fact that for all his crass attempts to provoke the opposition, he could also be canny and diligent.
He was appointed captain for the remaining three Tests the day after the Edgbaston defeat and before his first selection meeting he canvassed the opinions of the best county quicks and several umpires. Who is the best English player of fast bowling he asked. Who is the most difficult player on the circuit to get out The almost universal response was, of course, Boycott. But Greig persisted. Who comes next The answer, a surprising one for Greig too, was Northamptonshires David Steele, a 33-year-old Staffordshire-born No3 in his 13th season at Wantage Road, a printer by trade who had been mentioned as a potential international only once, as a possible for the side Tony Lewis took to India in 1972-73.
The man, inevitably known as Stainless became the first captains-pick of the Greig era, joining seven survivors from Edgbaston plus Bob Woolmer, then seen as an all-rounder and picked to bat below Alan Knott at No8, Barry Wood and Peter Lever.
Steele dogged bat
Steeles selection was no harbinger for optimism. He was seen as dogged at best, his resoluteness praised but little hope invested that he could succeed where the more stylish Fletcher, Denness and Luckhurst had all failed.
Greig was not the type of captain to defer a challenge and, on winning the toss at Lords, chose to bat. Wood survived 12 balls until Lillee trapped him leg-before and at 10 for one Steele was forced to leave his seat in the home dressing room. On previous visits to Lords he had stripped in the away changing room and now, at the precise moment of Englands call to action, he became discombobulated by winding down the pavilions stairs in an unfamiliar direction from the home corridor, trotting on down them until he found himself in the basement by the gents. What a way to go that would have been: timed out on debut. But he was quick enough on his heel to make it back to ground level, across the Long Room, down the steps and through the gate with seconds to spare.
The first glimpse of him fostered little confidence. The grey hair, the ten-to-two gait, the steel-rimmed specs all suggested frailty but there was something intriguing, too, recalling the old maxim that a great deal can be learned about a man from the tilt of his hat. Steele wore his England cap with the peak turned upwards like a jockeys, giving him a schoolboyish air, the look of a raffishly silver Puck, Andy Warhols spitting image puppet and Jerry Lewiss Professor Julius Kelp rolled into one. What the Australians are supposed to have said to him by way of greeting are in all the anthologies of quotations and, though they have been polished and embellished on the after-dinner circuit for years which makes their accuracy difficult to determine, as with David Lloyd and his pink Litesome the legend defies quibbles about its precise veracity.
Who the hell is this asked Lillee, Thomson or an Australian voice depending on the version. Groucho Marx Thomsons welcome, though now disputed by Steele, asked: Whove they picked now Bloody Father Christmas And to finish it off Rod Marsh allegedly shouted to Lillee: You didnt tell me your father was playing in this match.
Whatever was said it did not unnerve him and he got off the mark, not with a nudge or a block or a steer but by pivoting on his right hip and pulling a waist-high short ball from Lillee behind square for four. If he was later to be perceived as a defensive, defiant batsman, a masterly player of world-class fast bowling on relatively slow wickets, obduracy was not a hallmark of his maiden innings.
Steele then pulled Lillee for four more but his next attacking shot was his finest, a flashing hook for four which brought his Duncan Fearnley up in an elegant arc to finish above his left shoulder. This is the moment in the biopic when Steele would say: Groucho Father Christmas Daddy Whats my name, sucker Sadly Jim Laker, commentating for the BBC, had not read the script. What a great shot there by Dennis Steele, he said. This boy is not frightened. A great shot to Dennis Steele.
Lillee strikes early
None of his first three partners stuck around  John Edrich went for nine, Amiss for a duck and Gooch for six until he was joined by the man to whom he owed his selection at 49 for four. Lillee had taken all four wickets in a 10-over burst from the Nursery end but his new-ball partner, Thomson, was at sea on the slope. He had struggled with consistency all tour, found the pitches unhelpful, and was persistently no-balled, 22 of them plus four wides on the first day at Lords alone. From the start Greig wanted to make sure no one could doubt that this was not the same old stoical England. He began by smashing Lillee over mid-off for four, punched Walker off his toes for two more boundaries and drove Lillee square on the up with such timing and power that it sounded like a rifle shot.
The captain reached his half-century first and encouraged Steele to emulate him. The newcomer hit nine fours in all, played solidly off the front foot but used the pace of the pitch to punish anything short, rocking back with fine judgment. They put on 96 for the fifth wicket and were parted when Steele had made 50 off 103 balls, playing on when trying to force Thomson square off the back foot. He was given a standing ovation when he left and grown men suddenly found themselves swallowing hard and trying to explain that there was something in their eyes. The Daily Mails Ian Wooldridge wrote the following morning that Steele was a man who got up that morning and said that life has nothing more to offer than play for England. It summed up the pre-match pessimism perfectly but honoured one for whom a call-up was not feared but relished as the zenith of his career.
Knott, as he so often would, proved to be Greigs loyal aide-de-camp, scoring 69 to his captains 96 and England at last had a score, 315, the first time in six Tests they had passed 300 when both Lillee and Thomson were in the opposition side. In the second innings they made 436, Edrich taking two minutes short of nine hours to score 175 while Steele contributed 45 to the cause, earning England a draw. In the following two Tests, both drawn, the one at Headingley thanks to supporters of George Davis and rain, he scored 73, 92, 39 and 66 and captured the hearts of the nation so completely that he became the first cricketer since Jim Laker in 1956 to win the BBC Sports Personality of the Year award.
The next year, against West Indies, Andy Roberts at his most lethal and Michael Holding off his long run, Steele scored his maiden Test century and hit 308 runs in the series before being dropped for the tour of India because of his supposed frailties against spin. Robin Smith would later share the same fate. His Test career was over after 14 months at the age of 35 and with an average of 42.06.
Steele was venerated then and now because, in Clive Taylors immaculate metaphor, he was the bank clerk who went to war. It was all so unexpected that a veteran debutant would stand up to Lillee and Thomson. Of course, the pitches helped him. Thomson maintains that had he toured the previous winter Steele would have had his head knocked off, but none of that is any detriment to the affection in which he is held.
If Cowdreys comeback was the personification of the ancient knight doing his duty, a Sir Lancelot fantasy, Steele spoke more to the myth of the stout English yeoman, honest, courageous and indomitable, the antithesis of decadent, who restored self-respect. When the batsman retired in 1984 Frank Keating, as he usually did, bade him the most playful and heartfelt farewell: Thanks for the memory Mr Steele.
The way you touched your cap, the way you played for tea  no, no, they cant take that away from me. Even 29 years on from that epitaph for those who lived through the nadir of 1974-75, memories of Stainless remain untarnished.

Dividing SLFP into separate groups is futile: Duminda
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake said the formation of separate groups within the SLFP was baseless and urged the SLFPers not to weaken the political powers of the party by resorting to such acts.
He was addressing the gathering at the opening of the Kekirawa SLFP Party office.
The SLFP has a few opinions. Though former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated on January 8, 2015, the SLFP supporters were not defeated. The Chairman of the SLFP was defeated by the General Secretary of the SLFP. Since former President Mahinda Rajapaksa handed over the chairmanship of the Party to President Maithripala Sirisena, the SLFP supporters did not lose, he said. "Every politician should have the ability to accept victory or defeat. Dividing in to groups within the party is baseless. If SLFP Parliamentarians united as one group, no SLFPer would have to face difficulties," he said.
"Everybody should accept that former Presidents Mahinda Rajapaksa and Chandrika Kumaratunga could not compete at the Presidential Election. So they are unable to form a government. All members of the SLFP should be politically united to form a SLFP government," he said.
"President Maithripala Sirisena's term ends only on January, 2021 and nobody could change that fact. Only President Maithripala Sirisena could compete at the next Presidential Election and not Mahinda Rajapaksa," Minister Duminda Dissanayake said.
The Minister urged all SLFP members to support the SLFP to win the upcoming Local Government Election. "The Local Government bodies would be formed only for four years and President Maithripala Sirisena would be the president till the end of the term of LG bodies expire. As representatives of the President, the SLFP members of the LG bodies could easily bring development activities to the villages," the Minister said.

Easy victory for SLPP: ex-NCP Chief Minister
Since the parties in the Yahapalana government are contesting the forthcoming local election as seven separate groups, the SLPP which is contesting in coalition with 18 other parties, will clinch an easy victory, former Chief Minister of the North Central Province S. M. Ranjith Samarakoon said.
Addressing a press conference held yesterday, Samarakoon said former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was defeated because the UNP, SLFP, JVP, SLMC, TNA, JHU, plantation sector parties and Rishad Bathiudeen's party contested the last election in coalition. This victory could not be repeated because they were now contesting separately, he said.

Fertilizer shortage over from January 1
The country's current scarcity of fertilizer ends after December 31. We commence distributing fertilizer, especially urea, from December 30 on the basis of 3,000 MT of fertilizer for each district. As such, no farmer is required to amass fertilizer in bulk in fear that the shortage would continue, said Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
He said according to information, some fertilizer agents are responsible for exaggerating the shortage while the act of some farmers hoarding fertilizer at domestic level aggravated the scarcity unnecessarily, the Minister said.
He was speaking at a local government election rally held at Solama Village in the Thambuttegama area, where nearly 100 UNP supporter families crossed over to the SLFP before the minister received the party membership.
The farmers, who were present at the meeting, questioned the minster about measure to take during inadequate rain, earning livelihoods, the scarcity of fertilizer in the market and poor distribution of fertilizer through agrarian service centers as an alternative method, which as a whole hampered the cultivation efforts at the verge of elections.
The Minister responding to inquiries said the shortage was created as the consignment of 40,000 MTs of fertilizer to be brought from Pakistan was not executed. Pakistan stopped the delivery of stocks since Pakistan itself suffered a scarcity. He said as a temporary measure, the government purchased 7,000 MTs from private companies locally at a higher price and distributed them among farmers at Rs. 2,500 per bag.
A shipment of 75,000 MTs of fertilizer will arrive here and we are providing 3,000 MTs of fertilizer initially, including urea, to all districts by December 31. Farmers should not buy fertilizer at exorbitant prices. We feel that there should be a large-scale agricultural fertilizer processing project based in Eppawala Phospate deposit, to address local fertilizer needs. Also, we are determined to accelerate the carbonic fertilizer industry on village to village basis, Minister Dissanayake said.
He said farmers, who have undergone heavy agricultural losses in four consecutive seasons, are suffering.
In the Anuradhapura district alone, the government, so far, spent Rs. 1,500 million for the distribution of dry food rations among 140,000 farmer families and continue to do so depending on the rainfall. He said it was a pity that some bankrupted and power greedy political characters are unwarrantedly using natural disasters such as drought, flood, landslides etc in the election campaign against the government to hoodwink voters.

Financial aid for inventors
The Science, Technology and Research Ministry has taken measures to grant financial aid to new inventors to commercialize their products under the Nawa Nipayum Diriya Grant Scheme Programme.
A ceremony to hand over financial aid to five inventors was held yesterday at the Science, Technology and Research Ministry under the patronage of Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha.
Financial aid was handed over to Dr. Sanath Hettige who won the Presidential Award for the best medical invention in 2016 for his invention of papaya leaf syrup, tablets and capsules for the treatment of dengue fever. Kodikarage Piyasena was awarded for his invention of alternatives for polythene products using banana fiber. Benet Upali Sirimanne was awarded for his invention of sink drainage solution, Janaka Kotuwegedara for his invention of moisturizing lotion and Prasanna Vithanage for his invention of solar heat dryer.
Financial aid worth Rs. 9.6 million was also handed over to the Engineering Faculty of the Jaffna University for the establishment of the National Incubation Centre.
The Ministry plans to set up five National Incubation Centres in five districts and one such centre had already been established at the National Engineering Research and Development Centre. Addressing the media after handing over the financial aid, Minister Premajayantha said the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission has been mandated to grant financial aid to inventors for the commercialization process.
The Minister said the commission disburses funds through the Innovation Accelerator Funding Mechanism of Sri Lanka. The Science, Technology and Research Ministry has set up an Innovation Accelerator Funding Mechanism for Sri Lanka which will be managed and implemented by the Sri Lankan Inventors Commission (SLIC) to support Sri Lankan inventors to commercialize their inventions.

Homeless couple seek shelter
An elderly and feeble couple, Richard Silva and his wife K. Sikthy, were forced to lead a miserable life on the banks of the Mahaweli Ganga below the Katugastota bridge ever since they were evicted from their unauthorised house built on a Mahaweli zone land at Kahalla, Katugastota many years ago.
Their illiteracy was partly responsible for their present plight. They say they spend the night sleeping on a rock in the biting cold with no shelter over their heads.
They hoped that relevant authorities or a philanthropist would intervene to provide them with a decent shelter to lead their last days in contentment.
