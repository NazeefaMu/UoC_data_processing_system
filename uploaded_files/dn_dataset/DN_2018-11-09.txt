Mahendran will be extradited - Minister
The new government will take measures to have former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran extradited to Sri Lanka and charged for the Central Bank bond scam, Public Administration, Home Affairs and Justice Minister Susil Premajayantha said yesterday.
Addressing the media at the Prime Ministers Office he said the new government intends to recur the loss the country suffered due to the Treasury Bond scam.
Yes definitely.This is a very simple thing. There are several others who are respondents in this issue and if the evidence recorded at the Bond Commission is to be used in courts, then we must pass the amendments that was brought to parliament, which was delayed, and through that we can make progress, he said.
When asked if Arjuna Mahendran can be extradited to Sri Lanka, he said that there is provision under the extradition treaty between the two countries to have him extradited. In the first place former PM Wickremesinghe should have known to keep him in the country and not let him leave, as he is the one who brought him here and appointed him as the Central Bank Governor.
Otherwise, he should have taken the responsibility to bring him back as he vouched for him and had him appointed. He made these mistakes and now we have to face the consequences and resolve it.

PRESIDENT SUPREME UNDER CONSTITUTION - Envoy
Sri Lanka will not allow itself to be drawn into an attempt to retain a declining global hegemony, said Sri Lankas ambassador in Russia Dr. Dayan Jayatilleka said.
Jayatilleka added that Sri Lanka was concerned as there are very clear policy prescriptions made from certain capitals of the world.
But since we live in the time where there are voices which tell your President what should be done in your country, we are not surprised that there are those who try to tell us and our elected President what we should do in our country. There are some who actually have media conferences and tell our elected President, what he should do and when he should do it. These are the same voices. Sri Lanka will not allow itself to be drawn in to an attempt to retain a declining global hegemony, Dr Jayatilleka said, briefing top Russian officials in Moscow on the political developments in Sri Lanka.
Dr. Jayatilleka made it clear that the Executive was supreme under the Sri Lankan Constitution.
He reiterated that some friends of Sri Lanka raise their voices saying that views of the elected representatives should be heard but these voices forget that the highest elected representative in the country is the executive President who would be elected by the country as a whole and can take the office if he or she has over fifty percent of the vote. He expressed his gratitude to Russia, which has never told us what to do in our own country. Russia always respected us, and helped us protect our national independence, our national sovereignty, our territorial integrity, and our unity.
Addressing the Russian officials, he said: This re-allying is actually the re-convergence of our President and the new Prime-Minister. This is the re-convergence of the broadest political forces which among other things have the same strong friendly views towards the Russian Federation and the President of Russia. And those who have been displaced are those who have residues of Russophobia and Sinophobia.
Excerpts from his speech: From your own experience you know that there were certain tendencies that prevailed in Russia in the 1990s, which were going in a certain direction but the Russian people decided to make a course correction and to return to the path that is mostly suited to the national and the state interests of Russia.
We have been going through a similar experience ourselves. And now there is a moment of political complexity, even political tension, political struggle between these two tendencies that you experienced in the 1990s and at the dawn of the twenty first century. We are seeing in Sri Lanka today certain efforts on the part of certain players, which remind us of what happened during the so-called coloured revolutions, and the so-called Arab spring.
The President visited Russia last year and had a very successful meeting with President Putin, whom he had made it publicly known was his favourite world leader. I am very convinced that anything that has been retarding the pace of our agreements and bilateral cooperation will now be removed, and once this crisis is settled, we can move forward in accordance with agreements we have signed at a much faster pace, and with greater political cohesion.

Sajith confirms PM offer
United National Party Deputy Leader and former Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa on Wednesday confirmed that President Maithripala Sirisena requested him to accept the Premiership.
There was a request from President Sirisena to accept the Premiership under the former government but I did not do so as it is against my policy, Premadasa said.
Earlier, addressing a public rally near the Parliament Roundabout, the President disclosed that he had offered the Prime Ministers post first to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and then to Premadasa, but both had declined the offer.
Premadasa stated this in reply to a question raised by a journalist at a press conference held at Temple Trees on Wednesday.
Premadasa said that they had discussions with President for the previous government to go ahead by rectifying their faults.
His wish was to see the President and the Prime Minister working together to make the Good Governance Government a success.
However he added he was not aware whether these efforts were successful or not as those were held at the leaders level.
