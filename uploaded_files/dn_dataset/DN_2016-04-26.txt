Write harvest
That time of the year for English writers has come once again. Despite attracting criticism from all quarters, Gratiaen is finally stepping into its 23rd term on May 14. Dr Harshana Rambukwella, a Trustee of the Gratiaen Trust and Director, Postgraduate Institute of English, Open University, explains to Daily News on how Gratiaen could enrich Sri Lankas English-reading community.
Q: The Gratiaen judgement faces criticism almost every year. What is your response 
A: I am not sure if that is accurate. There is far less criticism of the Gratiaen Prize compared to literary prizes such as Swarnapusthaka Awards or the State Literary Prize and many other literary prizes awarded in this country annually. I should add that decisions taken by literary judging panels anywhere in the world are criticised in this fashion. The appreciation of literature is very subjective so it is not surprising that people would express divergent opinions after a prize announcement.
Q: What is your generalviewpoint of criticism 
A: It is wrong to see criticism as essentially a negative thing. The fact that people are criticising a particular prize means that it has achieved a certain level of significance. What would be more troubling is if there was no buzz around a particular literary prize because that means the reading public and the literary community in general are indifferent to it.
Q: You are familiar with both English and Sinhalese literary scenes. What is your take on the state of critical commentary in Sri Lanka 
A: It seems to me that over the years the quality of literary criticism has declined. What we often get are either personal vilifications of particular authors or works rather than substantive critiques that engage with the literary or cultural merits of the work under discussion.
If not vilification, what you find is people questioning the judging process: how judges are appointed or the suitability of the judges or sometimes rather absurd conspiracy theories about how and why certain prizes are awarded. Some of these may be legitimate questions but if you want to engage in substantive literary critique you need to supplement your critique with nuanced critique  you need to critically evaluate the work, reading it with empathy and attention to detail, place it within its literary genre and draw inter-textual and inter-cultural comparisons and use insights from literary theory. This is something we see very rarely in Sri Lanka.
If you look at something like the New York Times, the Guardian, the London Review of Books or the occasional piece in Himal Magazine you get a very high level of critical engagement that we rarely see in Sri Lanka. Part of the problem really is ignorance. Many reviews I have seen are uninformed about global literary trends and therefore negatively evaluate what they see as something that is deviating from the norm. In some ways social media and blogs in Sri Lanka are better places to look for informed literary criticism compared to the mainstream media.
Q: How do you think the Gratiaen prize can offer a remedy to that phenomenon 
A: I am not sure if the Gratiaen Prize per se, or a book prize in general, can do much to impact literary criticism  that will be a much broader project involving the training of journalists, book publishers supporting critical discussions on texts, etc. What the Gratiaen Prize and other book prizes do is to create a culture which encourages writing. Essentially the existence of something like the Gratiaen Prize, now in its twenty-third year and awarded without a break since 1993, gives writers something to aspire to. I personally believe that the more literary prizes and literary events we can offer, the better  especially in a socio-economic context where the value of literature and art is being increasingly made subservient to the needs of the market.
The Gratiaen is also unique because we admit unpublished work and work from a wide variety of genres  novels, short stories, poetry, dramatic scripts and even creative memoirs. This admittedly makes the task of judging complicated and challenging but given the size of the English writing and reading community in Sri Lanka we feel keeping the prize open to as many categories of creative writing as possible is important.
Q: English readership in Sri Lanka is much lagging behind as compared with Sinhala readership. How could this be overcome 
A: I think this is a systemic problem that has no easy answers. To create a vibrant English language reading and writing community we first need to address systemic problems in our education system. Language policies adopted in the past contributed to this situation and now some corrective measures have been taken. But the problem is complicated.
One of the reasons why past language policies attempted to unseat English from its position of privilege was because of its colonial legacy and the ways in which it served to exclude a majority of the population. Unfortunately those same policies in reality contributed to the continuation of English as an elite language.
Q: Comparison aside, do you see any progress in English readership 
A: Now we are seeing a massive resurgence of interest in English  there are thousands of tuition classes, thousands of courses on offer and all state education institutions also offer English in one form or the other. Todays approach to teaching the language is also different.
It is now primarily seen as a tool for social mobility and professional development. This might be pragmatically effective in one sense because we dont then need to deal with the complications of English as a language of privilege and its elitist and imperial legacies but at the same time it will never cultivate the kind of reading and writing public you refer to in your question.
Perhaps the solution is to strike a balance and look at English as a communicative tool but at the same time look at it more holistically as a language of significant cultural and literary merit. This would, however, mean confronting the fraught issues of the politics of English  but no language is politically neutral and trying to treat it so will not get you very far.
Q: Could you explain the criterion of selecting the best work for the Gratiaen prize 
A: There is no set-criterion. As I explained in my response to your first question, literary judgments are by nature highly subjective. If you were to replace one judging panel with another, the outcome could be quite different. While there are some generic criteria that all literary judging panels will look for, there is a great deal that is variable. Attempting to deny or neutralize this subjectivity is futile.
In all Gratiaen judging panels we try to look for three perspectives: an informed general reader, an academic/literary critic and a creative writer. Our assumption is that these diverse perspectives will bring a degree of representativeness to the judging process, so that it is not biased too much towards one perspective. I would also like to stress that just because a writer does not win a prize from a particular panel does not mean his/her work is not worthy of recognition. There have been many instances in literary history of authors whose work has been rejected on multiple occasions going on to become highly successful and critically recognized writers later in their professional careers. The inherent instability of human experience and life is something reflected in literature and we need to be sensitive to this  it is after all this element that makes literature human.
Q: How many entries have you received for this times prize 
A: We received more than 50 entries this year. The numbers are important but so is quality. There have been years where judging panels have felt, while there were large numbers of entries, only a few could be considered substantive while there have been other years where the numbers have been low but there were a relatively larger number of quality submissions. We will have to wait for the judges comments at the main event this year to see what they think of the submissions as a whole.

Cinderella : New magic in old fairytale
You know this tale by heart now. Cinderella, the evergreen fairytale has been one of the most popular stories that have been brought again and again onto the screen throughout the years.
In Disneys latest 2015 version we meet the age old princess with a modern twist. When 10-year-old Ella sits on her mother's deathbed, she gets a bit of advice about how to live life: Have courage, and be kind. This is the theme which runs through Kenneth Branagh's Cinderella.
Cate Blanchett plays the evil stepmother with Holliday Grainger and Sophie McShera as the evil stepsisters
The gowns are vibrant in color and the set design is packed with detail. Symbolism is aptly used in Cinderella. Years after her mother's death, when Ella learns of her father's death during a business trip, and is quickly isolated by her stepmother, along with Drisella and Anastasia, the stepsisters who nickname her Cinderella, she is shown standing against an open doorway clutching a tree branch, a sentimental gift from her father. Branagh lights the scene between the gray, dimming glow of the outer world and the dark chamber lighting of the home now ruled over by her stepmother. As a grief stricken Cinderella stares out, the viewers are struck by the reality of the episode: whatever horrors the future holds, the home also houses memories of her loving family which the world at large simply cannot. This is a rare scene which captures the essence of the moment beautifully.
Familiar points
One of the drawbacks of the movie is that it could have been presented more artistically. Familiar points in the tale such as the princes impending ascension to the throne seem to overshadow any other lively discussions which the characters could have had.
Another noticeable point is that too much action seems to be crammed into some scenes. This is especially evident in the episode in which Cinderella encounter her fairy godmother. The transformation process is rushed through so aggressively that the fairy godmother hardly lingers in the viewers mind after the sequence comes to an end.
Genuine complexity
Though many artistes like Lily James, Richard Madden, Holliday Grainger, Sophie McShera, Ben Chaplin, Hayley Atwell, Nonso Anozie, Helena Bonham Carter, Stellan Skarsgrd, and Derek Jacobi have taken part in the film, it is mainly Cate Blanchett who stands out though she plays the evil character. Her character registers genuine complexity, conjuring years of heartbreak, violent jealousy, and calcified empathy. She's the only character that offers a convincing counterpoint to the overtly romanticized nostalgia in the script.
This might not be Disneys best movie yet but it certainly keeps the audience entertained. Well told and beautifully presented Cinderella is for all those who nurture a wish, aspiring to become a princess.

Love conquers all for the Huntsman
Its already a given that the love shared by the Huntsman (Chris Hemsworth) and his wife Sara (Jessica Chastain) is the driving force of the new movie The Huntsman: Winters War, but director Cedric Nicolas-Troyan said that there are many other aspects of love that they explored in the film.
The whole movie is about love. Love conquers all. But, love conquers all doesnt mean just the love between a man and a woman. Its the love between a mother and a child. Its the love between a child and its mother. Its the love between sister and her siblings, he told Collider.
Its love conquers all, but its all kinds of love, all the versions of love. It was about which version we were going to do with Emily [Blunt], and it was the mother-child version, the pain version, the love lost version, he added.
One of the challenges Nicolas-Troyan faced while making the film was how to distinguish Blunts ice queen Freya from Charlize Therons Ravenna.
We knew Freya could not be just like Ravenna. Otherwise, there would be two Ravennas, and it would be a little bit like an echo of itself, he said.
So, Nicolas-Troyan decided that Freya would have a strong motherly instinct, although the loss of her child somewhat clouded her judgment. Her character was more quiet, more introspective and more motherly than Ravenna could ever hope to be.
Meanwhile, Blunt said during an earlier interview that she really enjoyed playing Freya because of her complex nature.
Shes not just this rampaging villain. Shes actually someone who, as delusional as she is, is thinking shes doing the right thing  and that was exciting to me, she told C Magazine.
Youd be surprised by how much I enjoyed [playing an evil queen] and how easy it was to be this person, which is worrying, Blunt jokingly added. The Huntsman: Winters War in 3D format is screening at Liberty Lite, Colombo, Cinemax, Ja-Ela and Chaya, Kegalle. It is imported by Liberty Cinemas Ltd.

Mahrez named Englands Player of the Year
LONDON, MONDAY: Leicester Citys Algerian winger Riyad Mahrez on Sunday became the first African player to be named English footballs Player of the Year, as voted for by his fellow professionals.
The 25-year-old French-born Algerian international, outstanding in Leicesters incredible charge towards the Premier League title, received the trophy at a lavish awards ceremony in London.
Tottenham Hotspur midfielder Dele Alli was named Young Player of the Year at the Professional Footballers Association (PFA) awards.
Paying tribute to his team-mates, Mahrez, who succeeds Chelseas Eden Hazard as the winner of the prize, told the ceremony: All the credit is for them, seriously.
And for my manager (Claudio Ranieri) and the staff. Without them I wouldnt receive this award and I wouldnt score. Its the team spirit, and I want to dedicate it to them.
Im very grateful to receive this award, its a pleasure. Its extra special because if the players vote for me its because theyve seen Ive been great this year so Im happy.
But its more team things. Without my team-mates I wouldnt get this award.
Mahrez is the first African to win the award and just the second non-European, after Uruguayan striker Luis Suarez, then of Liverpool, in 2014.
A 400,000 ($580,000, 514,000 euro) signing from French Ligue 2 side Le Havre in January 2014, Mahrez has contributed 17 goals and 11 assists to help put Leicester on the brink of becoming English champions for the first time.
He had scored the opener in the Foxes 4-0 thrashing of Swansea City earlier in the day at the King Power Stadium, which left Claudio Ranieris side eight points clear of second-placed Tottenham with three games left to play.

Mahrez was then flown by helicopter to the ceremony as he pipped club colleagues Jamie Vardy and NGolo Kante as well as West Ham Uniteds Dimitri Payet, Tottenhams Harry Kane and Arsenals Mesut Ozil to the award.

Sebastianites owe their success to coach Imal Boteju
St. Sebastians College Moratuwa was crowned as the all island under 19 Limited Overs Schools Champions 2016 in the tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy.
The architect of their success is none other than their Head Coach Imal Boteju who took over from Nalin Wijesinghe last year.
Imal represented his alma-mater Nalanda College at all levels of cricket whilst at school and led the under 17 B cricket team to clinch the all island championship. Leaving school he was employed at Metropolitan Agencies and later shifted to Arpico and played for Colts Cricket Club.
He commenced his coaching in 2003 initially at Colombo International School and then at Nalanda Cricket Academy. Coaching Mahanama College Colombo under 15 cricket team they were runners up in 2012 and Nalanda College under 13 Division one team emerged champions under his guidance.
Under his coaching at St. Sebastians along with former Panadura Royalist Manoj Chanaka as his assistant Sebs played nineteen games both traditional and tournament and won two outright, fourteen first innings wins and lost three on first innings. They missed the services of their Star batsman and Skipper Avishka Fernando who was involved in Sri Lanka under 19 cricket and under 19 World Cup. He played only in six matches.
They carried away the major honours at the 66th Big Match against their arch rivals Prince of Wales which ended in a tame draw. Any how they beat Cambrians in the 31st limited overs match convincingly.
In the limited Over under 19 cricket tournament organized by Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association for the Singer Trophy they clinched the championship by beating formidable Trinity College but they lost to them in the Semi Finals at the T/20 Schools cricket tournament. Four players from the School are currently involved in the Provincial Tournament.
He told the Daily News Sports that the former Bro.Director Rev. Fr. Bonnie Fernandopulle, the Prefect of games Rev. Fr. Priyan Tissera, Master in Charge ever green Frank Cooray and the present Bro.Director Rev. Fr. Ranjith Andradi extended their fullest support to achieve his goal.

Neymar to lead Brazils Operation Olympic Medals
RIO DE JANEIRO, MONDAY: Football superstar Neymar will lead Brazil's charge for gold medals at the Rio de Janeiro Olympics as the country seeks to forget its political and economic blues.
The country of 200 million people faces a nervous 100-day countdown to the start of the Games where it is counting on winning about 30 medals. That would put it in the top 10 sporting powers for the first Olympics to be held in South America.
The Olympic torch set off Thursday from Athens on a circuitous tour through Greece, eventually winding through scores of Brazilian cities before arriving at Rio's Maracana Stadium for the August 5 opening ceremony.
Brazil won a record 17 medals at the 2012 London Olympics. The same year, the government launched Operation Brazil Medals, putting about one billion reals ($280 million/250 million euros) into training facilities for potential Olympic winners.
In the past three years, Brazil has taken first place in 15 world events, which is part of our plan, Marcus Vinicius Freire, executive director of sport for the Brazilian Olympic Committee, told AFP.
Brazil, the most successful football nation, has never won the men's Olympic soccer gold. They lost to Mexico in the 2012 final.
But it has negotiated a deal with Barcelona so that Neymar will play in the Olympics but be rested for the Copa America Centennial in the United States in June.
The country has still not got over its disastrous 7-1 defeat by Germany in the 2014 World Cup semi-final in Rio. National coach Dunga will only be in charge of the Olympic side if the Copa campaign goes well.

Misinterpreted statesman
S J V Chelvanayakam was born on March 31, 1898, and departed his life on April 26, 1977. Many of us think that Chelvanayakam was the person who raised the federal cry in Sri Lanka.
The truth is that the Sinhala leaders placed the federal issue long before Chelvanayakam did. The South had been incessantly propagating the concept of federalism since 1925 but the North wanted a unitary state. Today, the irony is that the Tamils want federalism while the Sinhalese look at it with suspicion that federation is a ploy to separation.
In 1925, S W R D Bandaranaike founded a political party known as Progressive National Party. Bandaranaike introduced the federal concept for the first time into the mainstream of political life of Ceylon.
He proclaimed that in view of the existing differences among the people of our country, the only solution of the problem will be the adoption of a federal system of government. He opined that according to his type of federation, each government, to a greater or lesser extent must be limited to its own sphere of action and each must within that sphere, be independent of others. Certain matters, for instance, foreign affairs, defence and tariffs could be within the exclusive sphere of the central government. In respect of the other matters each regional government had to manage its own affairs.
Racial differences
Bandaranaike declared that the majority of us feel that in view of the local conditions, particularly racial differences, the most satisfactory method to minimize and gradually remove such differences is a federal system of Government. Such a system of Government has in other countries particularly in Switzerland, tended national unity.
The Kandyan National Assembly led by A Godamune and from C E Corea, Dr. T B Kobbekaduwa, A F Molamure and P B Ratnayake, a doughty Ceylonese patriot of that time, and several others formed the Kandyan National Assembly in 1925. This Assembly demanded that the Kandyans be recognized as a separate distinct community. However, by 1927 the Kandyans burgeoned their demand to a federal form of government.
They put forward a federal system on the basis of three federal units, Kandyan Provinces as one unit for the Kandyan Sinhalese, one unit for the Tamils, comprising Northern and Eastern Provinces and the third one for the Low Country Sinhalese. The faith in the federal form of government as a solution remained the bedrock of their political thinking for more than a decade.
They put forward the federal concept at the Donoughmore Commission. Though the Commission rejected it, they pursued their object upto the Soulbury Commission where they renewed their demand for three self-governing regional councils based on federal concept.
When Bandaranaike was propagating the lofty principles of federalism and the Kandyan National Assembly was demanding for a federal form of government, the Tamils were opposing the idea of federalism. The Tamils preferred some kind of arrangement on the ground of representation within the frame of a unitary character.
Unitary system of government
The prominent members of Jaffna Youth Congress: Sabapathy Kulendran, (Bishop of Jaffna), S R Kanaganayagam (Senator), C Subramaniam (Principal, Skanda Varodaya College) S Nadesan (Senator), P Nagaligam (Senator), A E Tamber (Principal, Central College), Prof. C Suntharalingam and many other distinguished persons, forming a formidable association of the Tamils, preferred a unitary system of government.
Ponnambalam mooted out the fifty-fifty demand - a balanced representation within the unitary character of the Constitution. In 1937, when the Reform for the Constitution was considered, Ponnambalam advanced this formula before the Governor, Sir Andrew Caldecott, and later before Soulbury Commission in 1944. The Tamil Congress was founded in 1944 just before the arrival of the Soulbury Commission to make his fifty-fifty demand before the Commission. Chelvanayakam was the Deputy Leader of the Tamil Congress. Ponnambalam never supported a federal system of government but adopted a policy of responsive co-operation within a framework of a unitary system.
A clerk was employed by Tamil Congress to assist Ponnambalam and Chelvanayakam of the Tamil Congress in the preparation of the memorandum for fifty fifty demand to be submitted to the Commission. A young undergraduate from the University College, Peradeniya, Mylvaganam Nagarathinam was selected for this post.
Young Nagarathinam felt that the fifty-fifty demand within a unitary system would not help the minorities. He thought of a federal system that was in Switzerland. Without the knowledge of the leaders of the Tamil Congress, he forwarded a memorandum on the basis of federal system for Ceylon. His memorandum received great publicity in the newspapers and Ponnambalam sent word to Nagarathinam to appear before him immediately. Nagarathinam appeared before the Congress Supremo Ponnambalam, Deputy Chelvanayakam and the Secretary S. Sivsubrmaniam.
They deprecated the federal system as a eunuch formula. Ponnambalam gave him a dressing down and terminated his services summarily.
Mylvaganam Nagarathinam went before the Commission on January 30, 1945, and presented his federal formula. Chelvanayakam broke away from the Tamil Congress and he inaugurated the Federal Party on December 18, 1949, to establish an autonomous Tamil unit on a linguistic basis within a framework of a federal union of Ceylon. Though, he formed the Federal Party to advocate a federal formula, the Tamil-speaking people did not support the federal formula of Chelvanayakam.
Sinhala Only Act
The General Elections were held in 1952, about three years after the Federal Party was formed. Chelvanayakam was defeated at Kankesanthurai, not by a Tamil Congress Candidate but by a United National Party Candidate, S. Natesan, son-in-law of Sir Ponnambalam Ramanathan. The Federal Party fielded seven candidates but two only managed to win the seats, namely Kopay by Vanniyasingham and Trincomalee by S. Sivapalan. The Tamils were not swayed away then by federalism.
The language problem was gathering momentum in the year 1956. Bandaranaike wanted Sinhala Only within twenty-four hours. The UNP too adopted Sinhala Only at its Party Conference held at the Kelaniya Convention.
The Sinhala Only Act projected the Federal Party in the eyes of the Tamils as the only party that was safeguarding the interests of the Tamils. It was the Sinhala Only Act and not the federal concept that made the Tamil people feel the political importance of the Federal Party. It gave ten parliamentary seats to the Federal Party at the General Elections of 1956. Their disastrous defeat at the Elections of 1952 turned out to be a glorious political upsurge at the Elections of 1956.
The policy of one country, one nation will be a futile exercise if one fails to develop a solution to satisfy the multi-ethnic groups of Sri Lanka as there are three main groups, Sinhalese, Tamils and Muslims who are distinct, separate, inassimilable and communally conscious people. The aspirations of any one community cannot be suppressed whether by way of force, democratic manipulations or parliamentary mechanisms.
For a nation state, we must create a healthy political atmosphere to promote a satisfactory Sinhalese-Tamil-Muslim partnership in the field of political power sharing. We have past historic evidence of son cementing his father alive for the seat of power. We have records of inviting foreign powers to defeat ones brother or another foreign power to get rid of the foreign power so installed. Let us not continue this disastrous game. Power sharing is the only solution for all the ills of Sri Lanka. It could only be done effectively and safely through federalism as advocated by Chelvanayakam.
In the prophetic words of Bandaranaike there can be a thousand and one objections against the system, but when the objections are dissipated, some form of Federal Government will be the only solution.
Tamils earnestly hope that the New Constitution would accommodate the prophetic sentiment of SWRD Bandaranaike.

Agree to be Green
As many as 195 States were parties to the discussions in Paris on the COP 21 Agreement which was accepted in general by consensus. The Agreement will be deposited at the UN in New York and opened for one year for signature on April 22, 2016--Mother Earth Day. The Agreement will enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification
It was recently reported that Cabinet approval had been given for Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha to sign on behalf of the Sri Lankan government the Paris Agreement adopted by the Conference of The Parties (COP 21) to The United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC) held in September 2015. It is understood that Cabinet approval was granted not for the mere signature of the treaty (which is not sufficient for the treaty to be applicable to Sri Lanka) but for the ratification of this Agreement by which Sri Lanka will be bound by the principles enunciated in the Agreement. Minister Premajayantha is to participate in the high level signature ceremony on April 22 at The Headquarters of the United Nations in New York.
As many as 195 States were parties to the discussions in Paris on the COP 21 Agreement which was accepted in general by consensus. The Agreement will be deposited at the UN in New York and opened for one year for signature on April 22, 2016--Mother Earth Day.
The Agreement will enter into force after 55 countries that account for at least 55% of global emissions have deposited their instruments of ratification. The overall aim of the Agreement is to maintain a global temperature rise in the 21st century to well below 2 degrees Celsius and to strive to limit the temperature increase even further to 1.5 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels, the lower level recognized as a buffer against worst case scenario impacts of climate change. Another important goal of the Agreement is to strengthen the capacity of States to effectively address and mitigate the impacts of climate change.
Article 2 of the Agreement stipulates that the Agreement aims to strengthen the global response to the threat of climate change, in the context of sustainable development and efforts to eradicate poverty, including by: holding the increase in the global average temperature to well below 2 C above pre-industrial levels and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5 C above pre-industrial levels, recognizing that this would significantly reduce the risks and impacts of climate change; increasing the ability to adapt to the adverse impacts of climate change and foster climate resilience and low greenhouse gas emissions development, in a manner that does not threaten food production; and making finance flows consistent with a pathway towards low greenhouse gas emissions and climate-resilient development.
Article 2.2. is explicit in stating that the Agreement will be implemented to reflect equity and the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities and respective capabilities, in the light of different national circumstances.
The Agreement also recognizes the need to put in place appropriate financial tools in order to achieve the aforementioned ambitious goals with a view to enabling developing states to face the challenges of mitigating climate change at their own pace and in accordance with their own national objectives.
There was considerable hope that the agreement would truly promote sustainable development.
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said: We have entered a new era of global cooperation on one of the most complex issues ever to confront humanity.
For the first time, every country in the world has pledged to curb emissions, strengthen resilience and join in common cause to take common climate action. This is a resounding success for multilateralism.
National climate action plans
The critical areas covered by the COP 21 Agreement are: mitigation  reducing emissions fast enough to achieve the temperature goal; a transparency system and global stock-take  accounting for climate action; adaptation  strengthening ability of countries to deal with climate impacts; loss and damage  strengthening ability to recover from climate impacts; and support  including finance, for nations to build clean, resilient futures. The Agreement espouses a long term direction that would enable States to reach a peak in their emissions as soon as possible and continue to submit national climate action plans that detail their future objectives to address climate change.
A UNFCCC Secretariat statement claims that, in the spirit of the Agreement, 188 countries have undertaken to contribute climate action plans in accordance with the new agreement, which is calculated to dramatically slow the pace of global greenhouse gas emissions. The basic philosophy of the Agreement is that future national plans will be no less ambitious than existing ones, which means these 188 climate action plans provide a firm floor and foundation for higher ambition. It has also introduced nationally determined contributions (NDCs)  updated plans for reducing greenhouse gas emissions  once every five years, which will regularly and consistently improve their strategy towards achieving their overall goals in the long-term.
The Agreement also provides for action to be taken even before 2020 where States are required to continue to engage in a process on mitigation opportunities and will put added focus on adaptation opportunities. Furthermore, since reaching the ambitious target of 1.5% below industrial levels would mean keeping at least 75% of the current flow of fossil fuels on the ground, and using renewable energy instead, States will raise climate finance up to $ 100 billion by 2020 that would assist developing countries to develop such energy resources. States will, in this regard, work towards defining a clear roadmap on ratcheting up climate finance to USD 100 billion by 2020 while also before 2025 setting a new goal on the provision of finance from the USD 100 billion floor.
A roadmap in this regard will be developed by States. There will also be put in place a robust transparency and accounting system that would allow for special circumstances and respective capabilities of States to be recognized and taken as part of the equation. Support and cooperation are the main themes of this philosophy. The Agreement also strengthens international cooperation on climate-safe technologies and building capacity in the developing world to address climate change.
Developing countries
All States are required to submit adaptation communications, in which they may detail their adaptation priorities, support needs and plans. There is also provision for developing countries to receive increased support for adaptation actions, for which there will be an assessment of the adequacy of this support that will be given. As already mentioned, the Agreement has incorporated a robust transparency framework for both action and support. The framework will provide clarity on countries mitigation and adaptation actions, as well as the provision of support. At the same time, it recognizes that Least Developed Countries and Small Island Developing States have special circumstances.
According to the UNFCCC Secretariat, the agreement includes a global stock-take starting in 2023 to assess the collective progress towards the goals of the agreement. The stock-take will be done every five years and the agreement includes a compliance mechanism, overseen by a committee of experts that operates in a non-punitive way.
From a technical standpoint, COP 21 addressed a number of issues which go to say that under the Kyoto Protocol  which is an international treaty which extends the 1992 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) that commits State Parties to reduce greenhouse gases emissions, based on the premise that (a) global warming exists and (b) man-made CO2 emissions have caused it - there is now a clear and transparent accounting method for carry-over credits for the second commitment period, creating a clear set of rules; and the first round of international assessment and review process (IAR) that was launched in 2014 was successfully completed. A number of technical and implementation issues related to the existing arrangements on technology, adaptation, action for climate empowerment and capacity building were also successfully concluded.
The Stern Review of October 2006 titled The Economics of Climate Change stated that if no action is taken to reduce emissions, the concentration of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere could reach double its pre-industrial level as early as 2035, virtually committing us to a global average temperature rise of over 2 degrees centigrade. In this context, Sri Lankas ratification of the Paris Agreement shows an abiding sense of responsibility and awareness on the part of the State.

Worst form of social injustice
"Many people are running around looking for income opportunities and as a result, the lives of more and more people are increasingly disorganized. Many of the basic services are organized and delivered in an extremely exploitative fashion, be it health, education, justice, human security, or even public health. Ordinary people increasingly feel that society around them is not just and the elites have become rent seekers, do everything to exploit them and enjoy life. They become agitated with the slightest provocation and maintenance of public order is becoming increasingly more difficult"
In an earlier article, I pointed out that there is an urgent need to increase productivity of labour and value added production, in order to arrest the present downward slide of the economy and with it, society and polity. This has become all the more necessary because, unlike in the past, today, most people do not want to live frugal and simple lives. There are about three million motor cycles in the country, in addition to over a million three wheelers. Urban roads are full of all types of motor cars. All this is for just twenty million people in the country which is by no means developed one.
None of these vehicles are produced here. We are just consumers of all sorts of transport equipment. Political leaders have no shame. They talk about protocol in allocating different brands of vehicles among VIPs, but never mention about the need to deploy unproductive labour for productive activities. They are perhaps happy that people are leaving the country in droves to work overseas and send remittances that can be used to import what the elites and others want.
In this article, I wish to highlight the tendency among a large part of the population to become rent seekers, without contributing much to production or productivity. While it is true that people in many modern societies have become more productive due to technological advancement and other social innovations, more and more people of many countries want to take an increasing share of the national wealth irrespective of whether they contribute to wealth creation or not. Most of these people are rent seekers who use their knowledge, power and influence to serve themselves.
Demand for various goods and services
For instance, in Sri Lanka, members of an expanding political class ranging from local level political activists to regional and national level leaders thrive essentially on various material privileges they enjoy at public expense. As is well known, government leaders have come under increasing pressure in recent years to appoint a majority of ruling party MPs as Cabinet and other ministers, resulting in top heavy governments that absorb a large part of the public finances for their own sustenance. When the economy was liberalized, the number of public sector employees came down substantially, from about 1.2 million to about 800,000. But, the previous regime, almost entirely for opportunistic political reasons increased the number again, this time to about 1.5 million.
Many of these workers contribute little to economic productivity but enjoy all kinds of privileges that the toiling masses cannot even imagine. They naturally contribute to the demand for various goods and services and in turn to increasing inflation in the country.
On the other hand, the private corporate sector has not been any better in the above regard. The salaries and other privileges higher executives of the corporate sector enjoy have little correspondence to the incomes of the masses, including their own lower ranking employees. This is the same syndrome that the whole world is talking about, namely, 1 percent of the population controlling unprecedented wealth while 99 percent struggling to meet their basic needs such as food, medicine and shelter.
Public resources
How do the super rich amass wealth While there are some innovative entrepreneurs and productive industrialists in many countries, even in the developing world, more and more people today turn to financial business, both licit and illicit, and all kinds of dubious services in order to make money. Most of these activities amount to rent seeking. These days we hear a lot about tax heavens, money laundering, offshore businesses, etc. Then, there is corruption of all forms.
Those who control public resources are well placed to seek a bribe or a commission to dispense such goods that include places in good government schools, government contracts, building and business permits, public sector jobs and even foreign employment opportunities.
Many professional services are not well regulated. As a result, professional service providers can often charge fees from hapless clients in an arbitrary manner. While clients are often exploited, large sums of money accumulated and used for consumption purposes by professionals contribute to inflationary pressure. The resultant increase in the prices of consumer goods and various services make the life unbearable for people engaged in rural agriculture and cottage industries. As is well known, many youths leave the villages in favour of urban services such as transport and trade. This naturally undermines productive rural activities such as agriculture. Contented village life is a thing of the past.
It is true that labour has increasingly shifted towards service sector activities in many countries over time. But this has been made possible by increasing labour productivity due to the application of new knowledge in the production process. But what we observe in Sri Lanka is nothing of the sort. Here, people have moved away from productive activities due to increasing economic pressure, resulting in a significant decline in economic production. This has made our situation worse because we have become more and more dependent on imports.
Increasing division of labour and specialization are essential characteristics of modern societies. So, theoretically, almost everyone is a potential contributor to development and public welfare. But, the actual contribution of various social, economic and political actors depends on how their activities are socially regulated. Various professional specialists have a distinct contribution to make but what they receive in return for their work has to be in keeping with what society can afford to pay without creating undue disparities across social strata. The same is true for political actors.
While they need to be adequately compensated for their important role in the management of public affairs, their privileges cannot be outrageously out of tune with the wealth of a nation. But, this is exactly what has happened in this country over the years. While the country is heavily indebted to the rest of the world, and more foreign debts have to be secured to service the accumulated debts, the members of the political elites want the most expensive cars for their day-to-day use, each costing as much as 50 million rupees. Their use of public funds for other services such as telephones, housing and overseas travel is often equally scandalous. While it is highly doubtful that such compensation at public expense is commensurate with their actual contribution to public welfare, in any case, the country can ill afford such extravagant expenditure at its present level of development.
Equal opportunities
The lack of careful social regulation of the redistribution of countrys wealth among its various constituent groups and strata has resulted in unprecedented inequalities and injustices. As a result, we have not been able to rationally allocate the countrys human resources both spatially and across sectors.
Many people are running around looking for income opportunities and as a result, the lives of more and more people are increasingly disorganized. Many of the basic services are organized and delivered in an extremely exploitative fashion, be it health, education, justice, human security, or even public health. Ordinary people increasingly feel that society around them is not just and the elites have become rent seekers, do everything to exploit them and enjoy life. They become agitated with the slightest provocation and maintenance of public order is becoming increasingly more difficult.
Against the above background, it is timely that we commence a new public discourse on how to rationalize income distribution and socially regulate the activities of institutions and groups in order to minimize rent seeking and create equal opportunities for all segments of society.
In the context of such a social contract, tax evasion, money laundering, manipulation of currency, real estate and commodity markets, bribery and corruption, exploitation of labour devoid of social protection, unregulated earnings of professionals etc. should not be tolerated.

Tokyo 2020 unveils 'snake-eye' logo after plagiarism row
Tokyo, Monday: Tokyo 2020 Olympic organisers on Monday unveiled a new "snake-eye" logo nearly eight months after the original choice was scrapped over a plagiarism scandal.
However, they faced an immediate backlash from critics calling it "dull" while in another twist, there was further embarrassment for Japanese Olympic chiefs after local media revealed the winning design well before the official announcement.
The new emblem -- with roots in feudal Japan -- was created by Tokyo-based designer Asao Tokolo and features a circular indigo-coloured Japanese traditional chequered pattern above the words "Tokyo 2020" and the Olympic rings.
Its three varieties of rectangular shapes represent "different countries, cultures and ways of thinking", organisers said in a statement.
"I don't know what to say, my mind's gone blank," a blushing Tokolo told a news conference. "The Olympic logo is a traditional design resembling a snake's eye and the other (Paralympic) is shaped like patterns often used by feudal warlords."
Tokyo organisers were forced to ditch a logo by Japanese designer Kenjiro Sano last year following allegations it too closely resembled that of a theatre in the Belgian city of Liege created by designer Olivier Debie. Sano denied any plagiarism. Officials insisted their decision had not been in response to a lawsuit filed by Debie but slumping public confidence as Tokyo organisers lurched from one crisis to another.
"It has been a tough process," said Ryohei Miyata, head of the Tokyo 2020 emblem committee, after Tokolo's artwork was chosen from a shortlist of four finalists.
"But now we have a new emblem and we hope Japan will love it like a new-born baby."

South Africa 2023 World Cup bid in jeopardy
Johannesburg, Monday: South Africa sports minister Fikile Mbalula on Monday barred the national rugby union from bidding for international events because they failed to meet racial transformation targets.
If he keeps his word - something he has regularly not done in the past -- it would dash South African hopes of hosting the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
South Africa, France, Ireland and Italy have officially bid to follow 2019 hosts Japan as organisers of the quadrennial rugby union showpiece.
Mbalula said in a statement he was barring the national rugby, cricket, athletics and netball bodies from bidding for international events because racial goals had not been met.
"I have resolved to revoke the privilege of Athletics South Africa, Cricket South Africa, Netball South Africa and South African Rugby to host and bid for major and mega international tournaments in South Africa as a consequence of the aforementioned federations not meeting their own transformation targets with immediate effect," Mbalula said.
