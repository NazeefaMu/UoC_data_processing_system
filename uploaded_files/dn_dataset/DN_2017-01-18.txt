Insurance industry grows in third quarter 2016
The insurance industry has achieved a growth of 16.97% in terms of overall Gross Written Premium (GWP), at the end of third quarter of 2016, recording an increase of Rs. 14,823 million when compared to the same period in the year 2015, the Insurance Board said yesterday.
The GWP for Long Term Insurance and General Insurance Businesses for the third quarter ending September 30, 2016 was Rs. 102,155 million compared to the third quarter of 2015 amounting to Rs. 87,332 million.
The GWP of Long Term Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 46,540 million (Q3, 2015: Rs. 38,972 million) while the GWP of General Insurance Business amounted to Rs. 55,615 million (Q3, 2015: Rs. 48,360 million). Thus, Long Term Insurance Business and General Insurance Business witnessed a GWP growth of 19.42% and 15.0% respectively, when compared to the corresponding period of year 2015.
The value of total assets of insurance companies has increased to Rs. 497,868 million as at September 30, 2016, when compared to Rs. 439,009 million recorded as at September 30, 2015, reflecting a growth of 13.41%.

Accordingly, the total investment of both Long Term Insurance Business and General Insurance Business in Government Securities amounted to Rs. 195,587 million (Q3, 2015: Rs. 157,256 million) as at 30th September 2016.

Internet marriage proposal ends in losing Rs. 298,660
A resident in Dam Street, Colombo who had allegedly aided and abetted a person frequently visiting Malaysia to defraud a female teacher resident at Airport Road Anuradhapura for Rs. 298,660 promising marriage to her 25-year-old daughter was nabbed by the Anuradhapura police recently. This follows a complaint to police by the female teacher.
According to the complaint, the teacher had published a marriage proposal for her daughter on the internet. The other person seeing the ad had replied it pretending to be an engineer employed in Malaysia and established a friendship with the girl over the internet and mobile phone technology.
When the person proposed to the girl, she had told him to meet her on his return to the country.
The man had said he desired to send the girl a gift parcel worth over Rs. 8 million through a courier service.
The man had then informed the girl that he had already handed over the gift parcel to the courier service but could not pay the fare as it was a holiday in Malaysia.
He had asked the girl whether she could pay the fare from the Sri Lanka end until he comes down and refunded the money.
He had thereafter given a local bank account number for her to deposit the money. Without batting an eyelid, the girl had got her mother to deposit the money in the given bank account.
Afterwards, the prospective fiance had cut off all communication lines to the girl and her mother. Since this aroused suspicion, they had lodged a complaint to the Anuradhapura police giving the bank account number.
The police, after tracing the bank account number, had arrested the suspect at Dam Street who was the owner of the account.
Investigations revealed that the duo had used this same bank account number to defraud people with this same ruse for quite some time. Further investigations are continuing.

Ko wants to get ball rolling on equal pay for women
Hong Kong: The worlds top woman golfer Lydia Ko wants her stunning achievements as a teenager to narrow the sports huge gap in prize money between men and women.
Hopefully one day it will be equal she told AFP, while recognising her and her LPGA Tour colleagues have a crucial part to play in growing the sport among women.
One of our roles is to obviously play great golf, but to also make a difference in the game, said Ko this week in a telephone interview from her Florida home to confirm she will take part in the $1.5 million HSBC Womens Champions in Singapore beginning on March 2.
Ko, who turns 20 in April, was the youngest player -- man or woman -- to become world golf number one when she achieved the feat almost two years ago.
She was also the youngest to win a major, at the Evian Championship in 2015 at the age of 18.
She added another major in 2016 at the ANA Inspiration, but the $6 million she made last year means that the New Zealander is the only woman among the sports top 50 earners, according to Golf Digest magazine.
The magazine placed her 44th, two places lower in the list than American journeyman William McGirt, who has just one victory to his name in 10 years on the US PGA Tour.
By us being on tour and showcasing talent we can grow the game and make it one day to be equal between men and women, she said.
Tennis is one sport where majors have recently given parity to men and women, but a gulf remains in golf. Last year Henrik Stenson received $1.4 million for winning the British Open while Ariya Jutanugarn banked just over $400,000 for winning the womens equivalent. AFP

Kumudu Prasanna triumphant at MX Muay Xtreme 2017
Sri Lanka made history in the international Muay Thai arena when Kumudu Prasanna won his match by knockout at the recent MX Muay Xtreme competition held in Bangkok, Thailand. Kumudu was the first fighter to represent Sri Lanka at a contest of this level, which saw fighters from seven other countries competing. Kumudu's participation was facilitated by the official local representative for the sport, the Muay Thai Association of Sri Lanka (MTASL).
29-year- old professional Muay Thai fighter Kumudu trained under Kru Asoka Jayarathna. His record, prior to his recent win in Thailand, was 10 fights, encompassing nine (9) wins and one (1) loss. His match at the MX Muay Xtreme was fought against a formidable Thai fighter whose record featured several more professional fights than Kumudu's, so the fact that he was victorious is a testament to Sri Lanka's rising stature of the sport. MX Muay Xtreme was a tournament that comprised seven fights in total, encompassing 14 professional fighters.
I am proud to represent Sri Lanka at the highest level of international Muay Thai competition at the home of the sport, and bring glory to our country. I would also like to thank my teachers who have guided me on this hard journey. I will definitely be participating at more international competitions across the world, and would like to encourage many more Sri Lankan fighters to take part in international competitions, said Kumudu Prasanna.
MTASL is the official governing body representing Sri Lanka at international Muay Thai competitions. The Association facilitated Kumudu's participation in MX Muay Xtreme, while also preparing him for many months beforehand with several Muay Thai workshops in Thailand. The Association is led by Kru Asoka Jayarathna, and supported by international coordinator / director Miran Nilanga, under the supervision of Kru Pak, the head of the Muay Thai Association of America.
MTASL is committed to take Sri Lanka to international Muay Thai competitions while at the same time spreading the sport across the country. It is also a career path one can choose based on how far one wants to go. Muay Thai is a traditional martial art from Thailand but it is also very popular in dozens of countries with many competitions held across the world, said Kru Asoka Jayarathna.
Miran Nilanga, International Coordinator / Director - MTASL has been instrumental in promoting Sri Lankan fighters at the international competitions and has been advising the association on how to develop and spread Muay Thai across Sri Lanka. I have been a practitioner of Muay Thai for over three decades under the tutelage of Kru Pak and this achievement shows what Sri Lankans can achieve at international level in this sport, added Miran Nilanga.

Learning from the experience
Angelo Mathews has branded the 0-3 whitewash his team suffered at the hands of South Africa as his worst defeat as captain. The Lankan captain is not far from the truth when he says that because Sri Lanka were not given a chance to make a comeback in any of the three Tests by a rampant South African side led ably by Faf du Plessis who has nicely filled in the shoes of injured skipper AB de Villiers whose long standing elbow injury (he has not played any cricket since July) had forced him to give up the captaincy.
I have been part of many defeats but as captain this is certainly the worst. We kind of expected to do better than what we did. But there was no improvement, said Mathews after his team had suffered a humiliating innings defeat inside four days in the third and final Test at Johannesburg.
The batters were extremely disappointing - all the batters, including myself. All of us had got starts but didnt convert them into big ones. That is disappointing. To give the bowlers a chance we need to put the runs on the board.
Certainly Sri Lanka gave themselves their best shot at competing well in South Africa in their preparations ahead of the tour.
When it comes to preparation we did our best. We practiced on wickets with grass back in Sri Lanka too. We kind of expected we will get wickets with lot of grass. Its not easy to prepare wickets like this in Sri Lanka, given the high humidity. Life goes on and we need to find a solution to compete well overseas, said Mathews.
However much of time you spend on preparations there is no substitute for the real thing  that is playing in the middle against the opposition. The atmosphere at preparations and during a Test match are totally different and so is the pressure when you have close catch-in fielders around you and bowlers flaunt you with looks that are sometimes intimidating.
A good example is the pains Steve Smiths Australian team took last August in preparing themselves for the spinning surfaces and hot and humid conditions they would encounter in Sri Lanka ahead of the three-Test series. Australia even hired the most prolific wicket-taker in Test history Sri Lankan off-spinner Muthiah Muralitharan as their spin bowling consultant to assist them counter the spin threat of Sri Lanka and to give the bowlers and batsmen first hand information of pitches and conditions. Despite all these preparations Australia suffered a rare 0-3 whitewash at the hands of Sri Lanka and when they left our shores the batsmen and bowlers had still not mastered the subcontinent conditions.
It is the same with subcontinent teams when they tour countries like England, Australia, South Africa and New Zealand where the opposite happens. Asian batsmen struggle against pace, bounce and swing in these countries as much as their counterparts do against spin when they travel the subcontinent.
Where Sri Lanka let themselves down was their lack of fight throughout the series. Losing is one thing but the manner in which you lose is what counts. Sri Lanka simply buckled under pressure and surrendered their wickets meekly which is what makes their performance disappointing and pathetic. On several occasions the batters made starts but failed to convert them into big innings.
This comes from a lack of concentration against high class bowling where the batsman rarely finds a loose ball coming his way to score runs. On occasions such as this it is important to keep rotating the strike so that the bowler is kept thinking all the time and there is less pressure on the batsman as he does not have to face the same bowler all the time.
Aravinda de Silva one of the greatest batsmen produced by Sri Lanka although brilliant was loose in his stroke play during the early part of his career. He had every shot in the book including the hook shot which you seldom see batsmen play these days. De Silva would bat as if he was good for a hundred and suddenly play a rash shot that would lead to his downfall. One season of English county cricket with Kent changed all that. It is said that a cricketers education is not complete without a tour of England. Why the pundits say that is because in England the conditions can change so quickly that you have to be at your best to counter the moving ball. One moment it could be bright and sunny and the next overcast with heavy clouds and the ball would suddenly start playing tricks on you. The experience De Silva got from that one season playing in England disciplined his batting to such an extent that he was a totally different batsman altogether. He scored seven Test centuries in his first 48 matches prior to going to Kent and 13 in his remaining 45 Tests. In addition it was his extraordinary batting in the semi-finals and final that won Sri Lanka the Cricket World Cup in 1996.
It would not be a bad idea if players like Dinesh Chandimal, Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva to name a few can be found contracts to play a full season of county cricket in England so that the experience they gain would tighten and bring about a certain amount of discipline to their batting which is what the present team batters lack when they play outside the subcontinent.

Live without fear
Fear. Biya. Bhayam. I am afraid it is a frightful word. Its meaning is known to man, beast and even plants, say scientists. Fear has a string of adverbs and adjectives attached to it. Also words that are close to it which gives a narration more flavour. But fear is fear. Fear is also called phobia. It is one sensation that revolves round all the sensations that are a part of man and beast.
The frightful message is sent to the brain by the sense of touch, sight, hearing, smell and taste. Ones reflexes could respond at lightning speed because of fear. Starting with animals. Fear controls them. It makes rats to flee from cats. Fear keep birds away from scarecrows, in plantations. The hungry crow will give a wide berth to a black feather or cloth. The millipede will curl up when disturbed. Dogs bark. It is fear or aggressiveness. Bend down to pick up a stone. It runs away. Begins to bark at a sale distance away. It is mainly fear that cause our friends in the lower rungs of the evolutionary ladder to attack or show aggression. Should a very knowing human disturb a hornets nest or bee hive, the results are obvious. They are afraid. Fear travels with man from infancy to grave. Why does a new born babe cry Is it joy or fear It must surely be fear. Because the new one will sense that he is entering a world full of fear, from its cozy 360 odd day sojourn in the mothers water bag. Then comes the grave. Many around the serene body are thoughtful. Fear. When will this happen to me He died of a heart attack. I dont want to die young. Fear haunts the mourner.
A human being encounters fear more than any other feeling like guilt, joy, laughter, hatred or sorrow. Always a feeling of what will happen next If nature goes berserk, a demonstration on the road, fear engulfs you. Fear is a very active partner in all actions of man. Also, when fear is active, depression creeps in. Fear engulfs tears and joy during childbirth, at home, in office, in a hospital and fear accompanies us during our travels. Thoughts are marred by fear. My hair stood on end, got goose pimples, numb with fear petrified with fear are common descriptions of fear. They say that Adrenaline is copiously secreted in times of fear. Animals can sense it. There are times when fear is warranted. There are times when we have to take precautions  against infectious diseases, natural calamities hydrophobia and the fear of heights  vertigo and the common fear of enclosed places like elevators. Fear makes a drowning man to grails a straw.

Magazine on a wagon
Have you read The Wagon Magazine- a literary International magazine published from Chennai edited by bilingual Prasad Krishna Beginning from last April it is continuing to be published. Many writers from India and other parts of the world are contributing to it. Its neither a highbrow academic journal nor a cheap popular magazine. Printed in glossy paper with suitable photographs. A better world through literature is its motto and to contact the KGE Team and to subscribe and contribute, their email address is:[emailprotected].
There are short stories, flash fiction, poems, plays and non-fiction incorporating a variety of themes. I found except for Aiyathurai Saanthan and Dr Noel Nadesan no Lankans are represented in the first seven issues of the journal. Budding and serious writers can contribute their writing and stand to gain an exposure to readers and writers in the international arena.
Some of the names of writers writing to TWM are: Jeff Coleman, Veronica Aldous, Terry Sanville, Karuki Wanyanu, Gene Hines, Richard King Perkins 11, Paul Beckman, Valentina Cano, Robbie Growth et al.
Indian writers include C S Lakshmi, Indra Parthaarathy, Era Murukan, Kalyanee Rajan, Deepalakshmi and others. They are all contemporary writers.
I first read and enjoyed the non-fiction in- depth articles. I particularly liked the articles by Dr C S Lakshmi as she has referred to Lanka. In the first issue, she has reviewed the book by a former Lankan woman militant, Thamilni, The book was originally written in Thamil and then translated into Sinhala and English. The English version has the title In the Shadow of a Sharp Sword.
The concluding paragraph of her review is thus:
Thamiinis book is not the story of her life. It is the story of a failed armed struggle that turned against its own people. It is a historical document pleading for peace. Knowing the history of the world, one knows wars are not difficult; it is peace that is difficult. Wars need only weapons of destruction. But peace needs unflinching eyes that would look steadily into that of others and speak the truth  the truth about the need to live for a land rather than die for it. What is land after all if not something bound within national borders or must one say notional borders I concur with the statement of the reviewer.
Another creative play I liked in the form of an Epic Poem by Dr Sadiqullah Khan titled Aristotle and Sappho. It is a dialogue among Aristotle, Homer and Sappho based on Poetics of Aristotle. Ambais (Dr C S Lakshmis) another informative article is Burnt Books and Identifies
Towards Feminist Theatre: an endless dialogue by C Raveendran is another interesting piece of writing.

Meeting on measures to brace for drought
A special meeting presided by President Maithripala Sirisena will be held today to discuss arrangements to face the prolonged dry spell in the country, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
State Minister Abeywardena addressing a press conference at his ministry yesterday said the country was heading towards the worst drought in 40 years.
The government should find US $ 1.5 billion to face the drought condition. The maximum amount of foreign aids we can expect is about US $ 500 million. About 600 new water bowsers are required to the country. The President has said he would speak to several countries to procure rice and equipment to face the adverse situation, the State Minister said. The water in our irrigation tanks and reservoirs are enough only until March. If there is no rain in April, we will be in a trouble.
The World Farmers' Organisation (WFO) has predicted that many families in Chennai would have to survive with one meal per day. The situation here would not be that worse, but our economy will be affected. Our production and export income will go down and various diseases could spread. We must use water and electricity sparingly, he said.
The State Minister said the Finance Ministry has asked the Disaster Management Centre to inform the amount of money needed to provide relief measures to the people in affected areas.

MINISTER DISSOLVES LCC DIRECTOR BOARD
The tussle between key players in the power and energy sector came to a head yesterday, when Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya dissolved the board of directors of the Lanka Coal Company (LCC) on the advise of Secretary Dr. Suren Batagoda.
Power and Renewable Ministry Secretary Dr. Batagoda told the Daily News he had written to the Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, prompting him to dissolve the board of directors at the LCC and call a shareholders meeting, to look into issues.
The Attorney General has published a report highlighting a many issues, many things done wrong by the LCC, he said. Not just this board of directors, but board of directors before also, since 2009  lots of illegal things have been happening, he said.
So many illegal things  awarding of tenders and all; and as the Secretary how can I sit and wait I have to do something. So, I wrote to the Minister of Power and Renewable Energy sand suggested that he dissolves the board of directors and holds a shareholder meeting.
The AG had asked  should the LCC continue and I asked the Minister should it continue Better to dissolve the board and conduct an inquiry. Dr. Batagoda said he had taken the initiative to write to all stakeholders  the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB), the Treasury, the Shipping Corporation and the Ports Authority, to inform them of his intention to hold a shareholders meeting  I dont think there has been a shareholders meeting these past five years, he said. While the decision to dissolve the board caused consternation in many circles, Lanka Coal Company Chairman Maithri Gunaratne, speaking to the Daily News, seemed unsurprised, if disappointed: First they came gunning for my resignation, then they brought in various inquiries against me, now they have dissolved the Board of Directors, he said.
Gunaratne claims it is his continued opposition to illegal activity in the power and energy sector that has brought about this decision: I have claimed, for a while now, that the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry, in awarding a coal tender to the company Swiss Singapore Pvt. Ltd. was incurring a cost of USD 10 a ton of coal.
This means the Sri Lankan consumer is paying USD 10 more than necessary for a ton of coal, he reiterated - I raised this matter in a letter, at the time, in 2015  but it was disregarded, he said of the decision to award the tender to Swiss Singapore Pvt. Ltd  the 5th highest bidder, and not Noble Resources International Pvt. Ltd. - the lowest bidder. In fact, the AGs report said my letter should have been acknowledged and acted in accordance to, but that was not done.
He said the Attorney Generals response to a petition filed at the Supreme Court by the aggrieved bidder Noble Resources International Pvt. Ltd. had found the Ceylon Electricity Board, the LCC, the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC), the Shipping Corporation and Ports Authority responsible for the loss of Rs.4.1 billion.
The Attorney Generals report had furthermore found the Standing Cabinet Appointed Procurement Committee (SCAPC) to have flouted all rules, regulations and guidelines relating to the awarding of tender procedures and deliberately misled the government, he said, adding that the Supreme Court in its judgment had said the manner in which officials had acted with public funds had shocked the conscience of the court But, while the Attorney General had recommended a broad inquiry into the issue, in a comprehensive manner, these have taken the law into their own hands and dissolved the board of directors of the LCC. 
The LCC Chairman said he intended to meet with President Sirisena today (18) resolve the matter: We helped to bring this government into power, he said, we believed in the Yahapalanaya ideology. I was appointed by the President and I was committed to protecting his interests and the interests of the government.

Nearly 15,000 farmer families likely to turn destitute due to drought:Farmers' Assn.
Out of a total of 7,400 acres of paddy land that had been cultivated during this season under the Bathalgoda Irrigation scheme in Ibbagamwua, nearly 40 day old paddy plants in about 6,500 acres had dried up and withered due to lack of water, said Bathalagoda Farmers' Association Chairman A.R. Herath Banda. He said that the lands were cultivated for the Maha season by using the slight showers experienced earlier, expecting more showers later on, but a dry spell had set in dashing their hopes of water from the Batalagoda wewa which was sufficient to for only about 600 acres of paddy.
He also said that nearly 10,000 acres of paddy cultivated in Hiriyala by using the little rain water and small irrigation water had also faced imminent danger due to the drought. In Hiriyala alone, more than 15,000 farmer families are likely to become destitute if their cultivations were destroyed.

N.Korea tells Obama to get packing
SOUTH KOREA: North Korea denounced outgoing US President Barack Obama for blacklisting leader Kim Jong-Uns sister over human rights abuses, urging him to concentrate on packing as he exits the White House.
The US Treasury Department last week added seven individuals -- among them Kims younger sister Yo-Jong -- to Americas growing list of North Koreans sanctioned for serious rights abuses.
The Treasury announcement came as the US State Department released a report on rights abuses in North Korea, which it said were among the worst in the world.
Obama would be well advised not to waste time taking issue with others human rights issue but make good arrangements for packing in the White House, state news agency KCNA said in a commentary late Monday night.
Obama had created the worst human rights situation in the US during his tenure, it added. He had better repent of the pain and misfortune he has brought to so many Americans and other people of the world. Nuclear-armed North Korea has carried out a series of atomic tests and missile launches during Obamas time in office, and been subject to increasingly strict United Nations sanctions as a result.
Washington has long pursued a policy of strategic patience -- essentially a refusal to engage in any significant dialogue unless Pyongyang makes some tangible commitment to denuclearisation.
The KCNA commentary slammed the Obama administrations extreme hostile moves against Pyongyang, which it said only bolstered the countrys military capability to mercilessly wipe out aggressors.
US president-elect Donald Trump, who takes office on Friday, has never clearly stated his policy on the isolated state, although he has tweeted that Pyongyang developing ballistic missile capabilities to threaten the US mainland wont happen.
In his New Years speech Kim did not specifically refer to the incoming US administration, but called on Washington to make a resolute decision to withdraw its anachronistic hostile North Korea policy.

## Title: No rain no grain

## Date: Wednesday, January 18, 2017 - 01:00
No rain no grain
Blue skies and drying reservoirs are to be a regular feature in the foreseeable future as we are to brace ourselves for one of the worst droughts in our recent history.
As water bodies dry up district after district, the Ministry of Disaster Management as of yesterday has estimated that thus far 111,329 families in the districts of Trincomalee, Kandy, Kalutara, Hambantota, Monaragala, Badulla, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Mannar, Batticaloa and Ratnapura have been affected by the drought. The numbers are staggering and yet this is just the beginning of our problems.
What do we know so far
It has now become apparent that due to the less than average rainfall experienced during the monsoons last year, currently there is a water shortage in all our reservoirs. Furthermore, the Meteorology Department has predicted below average rainfall in the next three months.
The rains are next expected in Mid March and the country needs to find a way to survive until then.
The water shortage will also spill into other areas such as power generation and food production and this will add to the current precarious situation.
Minister of Disaster Management, Anura Priyadharshana Yapa at a media briefing last week revealed that most main irrigation tanks were up to 27 percent capacity while 220 medium size tanks were at 30 percent capacity. In addition, this year, only one-third of all agricultural lands were cultivated which meant that there would be less food produced during the Yala season with effects spilling over to the Maha season as well.
We have also had less than 35 percent of the rice fields sowed in the main rice belt of the country, said Yapa adding that the government had decided to import 250MT of rice to meet the demand.
With the drought thus posing a serious challenge to the countrys food security, Prof Mohan Munasinghe, founding Chairman of the Munasinghe Institute for Development and Chair of the Expert Commission on the Sustainable Initiative said,
The issues we are going to face in the next three months is a good warning about what will happen in terms of climate change in the next 20-30 years. Our study at the Institute shows that in the next 20-30 years, small farmers in the Dry zone will suffer very much. Climate models also show that rice output in the Dry zone can drop by 15 percent or more.
This begs the question, do we save water for drinking or let our agricultural fields which grow our food have it The government in the meantime has warned that they would be shutting off water for agricultural purposes in certain areas given the shortage. Running short of drinking water thus has been a major worry all around but the National Water Supply and Drainage Board General Manager, G.A. Kumararathna speaking to the Daily News said they had not made assessments of reservoirs and rivers as of yet as the problem had not become grave thus far but they would look into having some controls in another six weeks. We will look into controls during the latter parts of February, said Kumararathna.
According to Amarnath Giriraj, Sub Theme Leader, Water-related Disaster Risk Management at the International Water Management Institute (IWMI), however, the best solution to deciding where the water should go could be planned using knowledge on the current water resource availability and its demand, which is efficiently monitored through water resource modelling and satellite data.
More Importantly, he asked that the Irrigation, Agriculture and Water Resources Department have better coordination on the demand and supply chain on the implications of drought on livelihoods and agricultural practices.
Meanwhile, adding to the problem, the Public Utilities Commission of Sri Lanka (PUCSL) has warned the government that they would have to find an additional 60MW electricity to avoid a power crisis in the next six months. They warned that the risk would be most severe during January and April with the countrys reservoirs experiencing the lowest water levels in the last 10 years. Accordingly, the government has taken steps to purchase power from private power generators. Other recommendations from the PUCSL include encouraging of self-generation mechanisms, installation of new generation plants and to have rooftop solar generation.
What should be done
This is not the first nor will it be the last time, the country would face a drought. According to Giriraj, Overall, South Asia is experiencing an increase in the intensity and frequency of the drought events.
When it comes to Sri Lanka, he said, The two major recent droughts in 2012 and 2014 were a result of monsoon failures in either of the Maha or Yala seasons.
Similarly this year too, the failures of the monsoons in the Yala and Maha seasons of 2016 have led to the current drought.
With droughts becoming a familiar feature of the Sri Lankan landscape, it has become vital that we safeguard our most precious resource- water.
We will have to look into saving water, said Kusum Athukorala, Chair of Net Water and Regional Coordinator for the Global Water Partnership.
We are heading into a situation where droughts will become the norm and we can reduce the problem by stopping the illicit logging and destruction at the catchments, stop polluting our waterways and save the good quality water we have and adopt household water savings, she explained.
Household water savings are not a new concept; dual flushes, water efficient fixtures and fixing leaking taps have been advocated for a long time but it is the implementation of it all that is lacking.
In Parliament, I saw taps that were leaking. They should set an example first, she observed.
More importantly, she pointed out that the country had very little preparedness to deal with environmental disasters such as drought.
We are still hoping that business, as usual, will prevail. We are only looking at bringing in more bowsers rather than looking at protecting our catchments, she said.
Further, we have always chosen curative rather than preventive measures. It is suggested that we look at desalination plants but that is very expensive. If we looked at preventive measures, we would be keeping our catchments pristine, even if we are to have less rainfall, we have a better chance of recharging our groundwater if the catchment was in good condition, she said.
More policies, less action
Sri Lanka, however, is not a dry country per se, it is home to 103 rivers with 90 percent of the total land area of Sri Lanka belonging to a river basin. We also have 3,540 identified water sources in the island in addition to the 12,000 tanks located in the Dry zone alone. The problem thus is the proper utilisation and distribution of water.
The Ministry of Land and Land Development in 2014 in a bid to become more proactive came up with the Draft National Policy on Protection and Conservation of Water Sources, their Catchments, and Reservations in Sri Lanka.
Considering the utilisation pattern of the countrys water resource, it appears that the protection of the above-mentioned sources is a fundamental requirement for the sustainability of both the surface water bodies and groundwater aquifers. For instance, the capacity of the shallow aquifers in the Kalpitiya peninsula could have fulfilled the drinking water requirement of a large population. But such waters have been contaminated to a level which could not be purified due to the excess adding of chemical fertilizer, agrochemicals, and insecticides to the soil, stated the draft.
Today Sri Lanka is badly experiencing the threat of silting in reservoirs which generate hydropower and supply irrigated water due to the clearance of catchment areas in high altitudes and poor water and soil conservation practices. For instance, 38 percent of the capacity of Rantambe reservoirs has been silted within 09 years of its construction while Polgolla and Rantambe reservoirs are being silted annually by 2.52 percent and 6.95 percent respectively, it further noted.
The draft policy also identified that one of the major obstacles in the path to taking any action lay in the fact that around 40 legislations passed since 1930, pertaining to water sources conservation was included under various sectors from land development, water, and forest conservation to soil conservation. Hence no one was directly responsible for conserving our water sources.
In addition, though there are a number of institutions involved in various activities related to the conservation of water sources, they are not properly conserved and protected due to the dearth of human and physical resources, various institutional as well as technological factors and improper exchange of spatial data related to this. Though some foreign funded projects were launched for the conservation of catchment areas, their objectives could not be achieved as they are not carried out after the prescribed project period.
The suggestions the draft policy proposed were, Identify, demarcate boundaries, protection and conservation of water sources, empower the institutions related to the conservation and protection of water sources, monitor activities and follow up action, awareness and participation in water conservation programmes at community level and the granting of financial provisions and facilities for programmes.
The policy, however, did not see the light of day and the officials of the present Lands Ministry are not aware of the existence of this very policy.
All is not lost
Environmental disasters, in the end, while cannot be avoided, can always be mitigated or be prepared for. Giriraj explained that prediction of weather forecasts over the recent years has improved substantially with 90 percent of monsoon forecast skills being highly reliable.
Our drought forecast system for South Asia can predict lead-time of 15-20 days in advance on the probability of drought conditions using climate and weather information, he said.
Given the advantage of the technology at hand, he proposed that we use active early warning systems such as the nowcasting drought monitor to identify slow motion of drought progress.
In the long term, Giriraj proposed, Investment in soil and water management, such as the improved development and management of fragile catchment areas and river basins, including small-scale irrigation; reviewing the appropriateness of current crop production patterns and possibilities in support of more intensified crop diversification policies; redirecting research towards more appropriate farming systems and improved rangeland and livestock management.
In the end however, there are only so many water bowsers that the government can muster and Giriraj said that ultimately the government would need to review institutional arrangements and physical infrastructure of many of its agencies in order to deal with situations such as drought in addition to looking into developing new crops, cropping strategies and insurance schemes when settling into a very dry future.

WAVES OF THE SEA
Why is the sea so upset and tense Without enjoying repose in the vast bed of space Her life is restless and rises with gigantic hands of waves And in utter fatigue her toiled hands fall for a while The sea Queen donning the royal crown of blue water Leads a busy life extending her good governance to the citizens of The sea kingdom with devotion and dedication The living creatures in this sea bottom and surface Enjoy swimming contest all the days and nights The roaming boats and ships demonstrate rocking of the cradle waves The sight seers welcome the flourishing happy waves Dashing towards the sea shore Desiring to touch the feet of anxious humans I wonder how the eternal waves resemble the non stopping workers In the productive fields! I feel surprised to watch sea waves as the natures gifts That were bestowed by the Almighty God.

SHADOWSFROM THE PAST
Flashing back in my septuagenarian mind Were images of my happy childhood days. Holding our hands we stood at the beach Enjoying the waters washing our feet Golden sand was tickling our soles Salty winds were touching our lips. No boulders were there to mark the sea On shivering sands we waded free. Collected sea shells abundant on our shores Built sand castles that waves carried by force The salty waters crowned with white foams Would dash on the beach crowning us all. We hardly saw a ship for they were rare, For hours at a lighted ship we would stare Wed watch the sun dive before sinking into the sea Homeward we marched so cheerful and glee. Everything is changed, old we are too Only in my dreams I recall these scenes.

I Am Dying
I am the Earth. Mother of them all. Im getting hotter and hotter each day, I just want to lay and rest. Let me rest, Im dying. My babies are dying, The ice is melting, The sun is burning my skin, My babies, My life. You cruel people, You choke me to death. Your chemicals are killing What I have tried to raise. How is life supposed to carry on... If my people destroy what Makes us live And breathe My poor trees! Just think and feel how they feel. Why are you putting rubbish on my skin STOP... OH, STOP it now! Youre giving me a disease, And its burning to my core. Get in my mind, come on, Look deep down and find My heart is slowly stopping. Youre killing me, You murderer.
Marie Negus
A Prayer in Time Of War
Thou, whose deep ways are in the sea, Whose footsteps are not known, To-night a world that turned from Thee Is waiting -- at Thy Throne. The towering Babels that we raised Where scoffing sophists brawl, The little Antichrists we praised -- The night is on them all. The fool hath said . . . The fool hath said . .. And we, who deemed him wise, We who believed that Thou wast dead, How should we seek Thine eyes How should we seek to Thee for power Who scorned Thee yesterday How should we kneel, in this dread hour Lord, teach us how to pray! Grant us the single heart, once more, That mocks no sacred thing, The Sword of Truth our fathers wore When Thou wast Lord and King. Let darkness unto darkness tell Our deep unspoken prayer, For, while our souls in darkness dwell, We know that Thou art there.
Alfred Noyes
If I Thought
If I thought for just one moment that this would be my last breath, Id tell you Ill love you forever, even beyond death. If I thought for just one moment that your face would be the last Id see, Id take a million pictures and save them just for me. If I thought for just one moment that your voice would be the last Id hear, Id listen attentively and promise not to shed a tear. If I thought for just one moment that your touch would be the last Id feel, Id embrace you and know that this has all been real. If I thought for just one moment that my heart would beat its last beat, Id thank the Lord for allowing us to meet.

President wants HR Action Plan revised
The Action Plan prepared to qualify to regain the GSP+ facility from the European Union has been revised as per the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, State Minister Lakshman Yapa Abeywardena said.
He said President Sirisena strongly objected to several clauses included in the National Action Plan for the Protection and Promotion of Human Rights 2017-2021 and demanded to remove those clauses when it was taken up for discussion. The President has also appointed a Committee headed by Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha to further study and give observations on the Action Plan. State Minister Abeywardena was addressing a press conference at his ministry premises yesterday. He said the Presidents objection was mainly directed at clauses relating to homosexuality.
Some of those were not even enacted in many European countries. Legislation pertaining to them has been debated for 50 to 60 years in Europe, but when it comes to implementation Catholic Churches have objected to them even today. The President made it clear that Sri Lanka cannot commit to such undertakings given the social and cultural implications attached to them, he explained.
Accordingly the section in the Action Plan which states, Review and consider amendment of offenses relating to sexual conduct to ensure non-discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation and gender, and to ensure compliance with international human rights standards have been taken out. It is wrong to say what is given in the Action Plan are conditions. We implement only what is acceptable to our country. Anything that goes against our culture and social life will not be implemented. This is a unity government comprised of both the UNP and the SLFP. The SLFP has retained its identity while remaining in this coalition. We are sensitive to what the Maha Sanga points out and what comes out from social dialogues, the state minister said. Abeywardena pointed out that new legislation is required to fulfill some undertakings mentioned in the Action Plan, and if they contain any inappropriate parts those could be objected to at the Cabinet and Parliament. The GSP+ is really important to us. We can improve export income by USD 2 million with this facility. Sixty six percent of our exports to Europe are granted GSP+ facility and 7,200 items are entitled to it. We will implement the Action Plan to the degree we can. We admit that GSP+ is necessary, but we are not ready to go to extents that could worsen the countrys problems, he added. The EU announced on January 11 on the restoration of the GSP+ facility. The state minister said it would be operational within another four months.

Radwanska survives : test to keep Slam dream alive
MELBOURNE: Polands Agnieszka Radwanska survived a dogfight to move into the Australian Open second round on Tuesday as she bids to end her long wait for a maiden Grand Slam title.
The third seed battled past fellow veteran, Bulgarian Tsvetana Pironkova, 6-1, 4-6, 6-1 and will next play Croat Mirjana Lucic-Baroni, who beat Chinese qualifier Wang Qiang in three sets.
Radwanska, who lost in the final of the lead-up Sydney International, has consistently done well at Melbourne Park, making at least the quarter-finals in five of the previous six tournaments.
But she is yet to break through to win a title at any of the majors in 42 attempts spanning more than a decade.
I have played her (Pironkova) many times and knew she was good, said the 27-year-old.
Im very happy that I was able to come back strongly in the third set and pleased to be into the next round. An Australian semi-finalist last year, she is desperate to end her long wait and started methodically against Pironkova, who made the quarter-finals of the French Open last year, beating Radwanska along the way. - AFP

Rajapaksa should not be opportunistic: Harison
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should not be opportunistic for political gains even from the existing drought that affect the masses, said Rural Economic Affairs Minister P Harison.
While the drought is affecting the entire region, the former President said it was a problem with the President and the Prime Minister. The responsibility of a former President should be to find solutions for the issue at hand without making groundless statements, he added.
He made these observations at a press conference in Anuradhapura yesterday.
Minister Harison said the government has allowed the private sector to import rice to reduce the price of rice in the market. He added that the price of rice was reduced by Rs 10. This measure will urge the errant traders who have massive stocks of paddy in their stores, to release these stocks. The rice mill owners are attempting to make hay while the sun shines, said Harison.
That is the reason the government decided to import rice. We are confident that the rice prices will further drop in the near future.
Harison said the country was self-sufficient in rice during the Rajapaksa regime. But it was not because of Rajapaksa. Could he order God Sakra to give rain The country was self-sufficient in rice because there was rain that season. We know that he lived as if he was above God Sakra. But today he knows where he is, Harison said.
He said there is a stock of more than 200,000 mt of paddy at the Paddy Marketing Board. He added that along with the stocks of the private sector there is ample for consumption until May.
He added that if the private sector owners attempted to hide their stocks, the government would act in accordance with the law. He said the government could check the stores of the private sector at any moment according to the Act.

Ranaviru Seva Authority continues to assist war heroes' children
The Ranaviru Seva Authority continues to provide more facilities to children of the war heroes who were killed or injured during operations, to continue with their studies, Ranaviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka said.
She said that had not those heroes made sacrifices on behalf of the nation, there would not have been a country today.
Fonseka made these observations at a ceremony yesterday to grant scholarships to children of war heroes who passed the grade five scholarship examination in 2015.
At the second phase of the ceremony held yesterday, 45 children of war heroes of tri-forces and Police were granted a scholarship of Rs 20,000 each.
The ceremony organised by the Ranaviru Seva Authority was held at the auditorium of the Navy headquarters.
Fonseka said the same dignity entertained by war heroes should be entertained by their children too.
She said the Ranaviru Seva Authority accepted that it was the Authority's responsibility to provide facilities for the children to continue studies.
She added that the Authority provides scholarships to children following the Grade five scholarship examination, Ordinary Level Examination, Advanced Level Examination and during the university studies and even for foreign courses after the degree.
"It is the responsibility of children of war heroes to make the maximum use of facilities granted by the Ranaviru Seva Authority and the government and continue with their studies," Fonseka said.
"That is the greatest tribute they can pay to their parents or brothers who sacrificed at the battle front."
Ranaviru Seva Authority Director Donald Kumarasiri Jayawardena also spoke at the occasion.

Recommendation of GSP +to Sri Lanka: EU denies laying down any conditions
The Head of the Political, Trade and Communication Section of the Delegation of the European Union (EU) in Sri Lanka Paul Godfrey yesterday denied that the European Union (EU) laid down any conditions as such to Sri Lanka - 58 conditions in total as some news reports have been suggestive of  to recommend GSP + to Sri Lanka. Godfrey said the European Commission in Brussels recommended granting GSP+ preferences for Sri Lanka to support the progress of the countrys commitment to ratify and effectively implement 27 international conventions on human rights, labor conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
Godfrey said on being asked by the Daily News if the government had agreed to comply with some 58 conditions laid down by it (the European Commission), which are said to be disadvantageous to Sri Lanka as regards its proposal to restore the GSP + tariff facility to Sri Lanka,It is not true.
As pointed out by Prof G L Peiris, a former External Affairs Minister of the previous regime, the current government has agreed to 58 EU conditions, such as the removal of the Prevention of Terrorism Act to regain GSP+, which he said would be detrimental to the country and its sovereignty.
EU ambassador Godrey said he even spoke to his EU colleagues in Brussels regarding these 58 conditions that the reports were suggestive of and was joking with them saying that if they had recommended GSP + preferences for Sri Lanka on the basis of such proposals, they have done poorly.
European Trade Commissioner Cecilia Malmstrm said: GSP+ preferences can make a significant contribution to Sri Lankas economic development by increasing exports to the EU market. But, this also reflects the way in which we want to support Sri Lanka in implementing human rights, rule of law and good governance reforms.
I am confident of seeing timely and substantial further progress in these areas and the GSP+ dialogue and monitoring features will support this reform process. This should include making Sri Lankan counter-terrorism legislation fully compatible with international human rights conventions,. Malmstrm said.
An EU report said: Sri Lanka had already benefited from GSP+ in the past. In 2010 the EU decided however to stop the preferential treatment for Sri Lankan imports due to the failure to address reported human rights violations in the country.
In 2015, the new government of Sri Lanka set out a path of major reforms aiming for national reconciliation, respect of human rights, the rule of law and good governance principles, as well as sustainable economic development.
The Sri Lankan government applied for GSP+ in July 2016 and the Commissions assessment has concluded that it met the GSP+ entry criteria set out in the EU regulation.
Sri Lanka must ensure its counter-terrorism legislation is fully in line with international human rights conventions. As a matter of priority, it must put a definitive stop to the use of torture by security forces and the related impunity.
The government must also see through policy and legislative processes to improve the rights of women and children, for example with regard to discrimination, domestic violence, minimum age of marriage, sexual exploitation, as well as harassment of trade unions. All of these issues would be subject to GSP+ monitoring to ensure that positive progress continues to be made.

Rhythm of nature
The Hempel Galleries presented Shaping Texture by Sue Harrigan recently at the Amangalla Spa, Fort Galle, Sri Lanka.
Harrigans love of natural form and texture is revealed in her interpretation of the human form, pattern and texture, which she will be presenting for the first time in Sri Lanka.
The ancient olive trees in the surrounding area of my home in northern Tuscany embody this. I see the twisted trunks resembling pleated silk skirts; knurled deformities as billowing fabric and the intertwined boughs soaring their way to heaven, as female bodies frozen in time. The rhythm of nature beats at the heart of my work.
Harrigan grew up in the UK on the edge of Dartmoor, in the vast wilderness. This proved to be an inspiration for her creativity from an early age. After leaving Kingston Art School, she worked in Rome with top fashion designers such as Valentino and Alberto Feretti and taught Fashion illustration in Florence and London where her work was regularly reproduced in fashion publications.
Harrigan now splits her time between Tuscany, the UK and Sri Lanka:-
 I have lived in Sri Lanka too: revelling in the colour and vibrancy of daily life and nature; the form of the Bodhi trees inspiring my work, is an accretion of my perceptions and observations.

Sacred book of the Mayans
Maya Civilization expanded towards a massive area covering all the Yucatan peninsula, modern day Guatemala, Belize, Mexico states of Tabasco, Chiapas and the western parts of Honduras and El Salvador.
The area covered by Maya civilization was divided into three zones of Southern Maya Highlands, Central Maya Lowlands and Northern Maya Lowlands.
Southern Maya Highlands comprised of all the elevated terrain of Guatemala and Chiapas Unlike other segregated societies in Mesoamerica, the Maya civilization emerged most dominant due to its topography. The Mayan Civilization maintained a prominent place as the founders and domesticators of agricultural products, hieroglyph writers, calendar makers, mathematicians and astronomers.
The staple food crops cultivated by Maya comprised of Maize, Beans, Squashes, Chilli Pepers, Avocados and Gourds. The Maya society was comprised of kings, ruling families, and a large class of priests who maintained a very complex calendar and transmitting knowledge of writing, astronomy and mathematics. The Maya merchants in addition to be engaged in trade deals, played the roles of ambassadors of neighbouring lands and allies. In addition, there were professional architects and sculptors who supervised the construction of huge monuments, temples, pyramids, the palaces and other public buildings and infrastructure development.
The Maya artisans had been employed in the production of pottery, tools, and elaborate cotton textiles. Physical labour had been provided by the peasants and slaves in all the construction sites.
The Maya invented the concept of Zero represented by a stylized symbol of a sea shell and their mathematical notation enabled them to write very large numbers in their carved inscriptions and codices.
The Decimal System based on 10 was not found to be used by the mathematicians of the Maya civilization. Instead a counting system based on 20 known as  Vigesimal  was used. According to scholars the unit 20 had been used because it matched with the number of fingers and the toes of a human being.
Maya mathematicians and scribes used dots and bars in their writings. In writing 4 they used only simple dots.
The Maya calendar was interlinked the Solar year of 365 days and dealt on Agricultural Circle and the Ritual year of 260 days dealt on daily affairs by organizing time into twenty months having 13 days per month.
In addition to the 260 day calendar and 365 day calendar the Maya developed a much longer measuring system known as  Long Count.. This Long Count system was in existence in many parts of Mesoamerica at the beginning of the first millennium B.C.
The calendar of 260 day is still used by the Quiche Maya people living in the tropical mountains ranges of Southern Guatemala. During the classical period of 250 B.C. -900 A.D. the Maya used the Long Count system in recording births, deaths, important dates of the Royalty, anniversary celebrations, dates of ritual practices and war victories.
Combining astronomical observations and knowledge of mathematics Maya priests calculated. The length of the Solar Year at 365.242 days about seventeen seconds shorter than the figure reached by the modern astronomers. .
Ruins of Maya Civilization could be found in Beilze, El Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and in Mexico and some of the Monumental Architecture and Sculptor sites are Chichen Itza, Palenque, Uxal, Yaxchilan in Mexico, Tikal in Guatemala and Copan in Honduras.
Maya inherited a unique type of a ball game and the ball courts are found scattered throughout the Maya empire. High ranking captives were found taking part in the ball game and losers become sacrificial victims.
Popol Vuh, according to its translator Dennis Tedlock who was also a shaman priest of Maya in Guatemala was a store house rich in stories on Creation, Ancestry, History, Cosmology, Noble Mayan Families of Quiche and the Maya Dynasties. Popol Vuh highlights the traditional Views of Mayas on the creation of the universe and human beings. The Creation Myth in Popol Vuh narrates how the gods attempted to create intelligent human beings that would recognize and praise them.
Before time began, the waters stretched out endlessly in all directions beneath a blank sky and nothing existed in the universe. There were no animals or fish, no birds or plants, no rocks or people.
There was only the Sea God known as Sovereign Plumed Serpent having some other names such as Quetzalcoatl, Gucumatz and Kukulcan feared and worshipped across Mesoamerica.
The Sky God Huracan felt the presence of the Sky God Plumed Serpent. Huracan the Sky God came down to meet the Sovereign Plumed Serpent the Sea God. Both of them were great intellectuals and during their deep conversation they had a vision how life should be in the world.
They discussed how to introduce vegetation, how to create human beings and other forms of life on the earth. First they decided that the waters should be cleared for the earth to rise up.

Serena, Nadal make sizzling starts in Melbourne
Melbourne: Serena Williams and Rafael Nadal made light of scorching conditions and doubts over their form as they got off to sizzling starts at the Australian Open on Tuesday.
Williams, back after an injury lay-off, demolished the dangerous Belinda Bencic 6-4, 6-3, while Nadal was also impressive in his 6-3, 6-4, 6-4 win over Florian Mayer.
It contrasts with the laboured progress of Angelique Kerber and Andy Murray a day earlier, despite temperatures rising to 37 Celsius (98.6 Fahrenheit) on day two.
Mens defending champion Novak Djokovic is due on court in the cooler, evening session when he will play his first-round match against Spanish left-hander Fernando Verdasco.
Williams has barely played since her shock defeat in the US Open semi-finals in September and she made, by one count, 88 unforced errors in her second-round loss to Madison Brengle at this months Auckland Classic.
But she came through a tight first set against Bencic before dominating the second set in what turned out to be a convincing victory on centre court.
The 35-year-old American, with a record 23rd major title in her sights, was watched from courtside by her new fiance, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian.
It was one of the toughest first-round matches Ive ever played, said Williams, who had a 1-1 head-to-head with Bencic, 19, before Tuesdays encounter. Right now Ive got nothing to lose. Every match, every tournament Im playing for fun, she added.
Williams, who can break Steffi Grafs Open-era record of 22 Grand Slam titles if she wins in Melbourne for the seventh time, next faces Lucie Safarova, who had a charmed life in her win over Yanina Wickmayer.
The Czech survived nine match points before winning 3-6, 7-6 (9/7), 6-1 against the flummoxed Wickmayer, who said she was feeling definitely not good after letting slip so many opportunities.
Its not fun, said the Belgian, adding: I think she served very well on certain points and other points I didnt go for enough.
Mens world number three Milos Raonic, a semi-finalist last year, enjoyed an uncomplicated start to his campaign when he beat Germanys Dustin Brown 6-3, 6-4, 6-2.
And German hotshot Alexander Zverev credited a racquet-smashing tantrum with sparking his revival as he came back to beat Robin Haase 6-2, 3-6, 5-7, 6-3, 6-2. Sometimes its good to let it out and I started to play my best tennis again after that (racquet smash) in the fourth set, Zverev said.
Injury-hit Nadal had a torrid 2016, failing to reach any of the Grand Slam quarter-finals, but he appeared rejuvenated under new coach and former world number one Carlos Moya.
The bodys good, that is the key, said the 30-year-old, who has amassed 14 Grand Slam titles. If the bodys not good, everything is more and more difficult.
Womens fifth seed Karolina Pliskova, whose win over Williams at the US Open ended her 186-week stint as world number one, smashed Spains Sara Sorribes Tormo 6-2, 6-0.
And Britains Jo Konta, riding high after her victory at last weeks Sydney International, beat experienced Belgian Kirsten Flipkens 7-5, 6-2 to reach the second round.
Britains Heather Watson ousted former US Open champion Samantha Stosur in three sets, and WTA Finals title-holder Dominika Cibulkova beat Denisa Allertova to reach round two. AFP

SLs women representation lowest in Asian region: Dr. Saravanamuttu
Sri Lanka has one of the lowest of figures in the Asian region and world when it comes to women representation in politics and decision making in public affairs. The backbone of our economy is women who work in tea estates, in the garment sector and Middle East, Executive Director of the Centre for Policy Alternative (CPA) Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said.Addressing a press conference at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Saravanamuttu said that Rwanda is one country with the highest women's representation in politics at national level in Parliament. Rwanda faced a civil war and it was the women who played a key role in bringing the country together. Therefore, it is very important that women representation in National politics and decision making level be increased, he said.
We have to increase women representation in politics at Local Government level and later at Provincial Council level and in Parliament. But bringing in more women into politics would not change politics overnight. Both men and women come from one society, he said.
The Local Governance Unit of the Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) has conducted 39 District discussions / dialogues in 13 districts covering the Southern, Uva, Eastern and Northern Provinces with considerable support from District Secretariats and Women Development Officers (WDOs) attached to the Women and Child Affairs Ministry in each of the respective districts. More than 2,000 participants attended these discussions/dialogues, he added. A Senior Researcher attached to the CPA Shriyani Wijesundara said that it was expected to appoint 2,206 women into Local Government bodies through upcoming elections.

SL-Thailand FTA study  to conclude by August
The Sri Lanka Thailand Free Trade Agreement (FTA) study is set to conclude by August 2017. Sri Lanka is also looking for sugar purchases from Thailand.
During his visit to Thailand to take part in the APTA Ministerial Council Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen met Thai Minister of Commerce Apiradi Tantraporn.
He also met Thai Consumer goods exporters to Sri Lanka, a leading sugar exporting company Mitrphol and also product manufacturer and a consultant of the Thai governments OTOP project.
The Thai exporters of consumer goods to Sri Lanka (sprats, rice, canned fish, green gram, sago seeds, shoes, and vehicle parts) met Minister Bathiudeen on January 12, 2017. Minister Bathiudeen explained that his Ministry is going to open 80 Sathosa outlets, which totals up to 500 outlets by the end of this year and also open 8000 new franchise outlets, selling Sri Lankan products.
Hence he called the meeting in order to identify suppliers of consumer goods, to educate them about expectations of Sathosa and also to get suppliers feedback to improve the importing system of Sathosa. Hon Minister requested for samples and prices of rice and sprats from the exporters. For perishable goods price will be called on a weekly basis in future. The industry encouraged direct purchasing from importers, after identifying trust worthy direct importers, which might be useful to maintain the quality of the imports. Due to the fact that Sri Lankan sugar importers have decided to halt importing sugar from Brazil as cocaine is smuggled in sugar containers, Minister Bathiudeen met one of the largest sugar exporting company in Thailand called Mitr Phol Sugar Corp Ltd to see the possibility of importing sugar from Thailand. The company was asked to provide information on sugar prices and the capacity they can supply.
Minister Bathiudeen was interested in OTOP project of the Thai government, which include the concept of promoting one product for one village, a meeting was held with an OTOP consultant and also a fruit juice manufacturer under the OTOP project.
The Minister showed interest to get their assistance to bring in experts to Sri Lanka in order to produce dried fruit products. They were asked to provide a report of the two projects; OTOP and Royal Project.
Bathiudeen andThai Commerce Minister Apiradi Tantraporn discussed ways for cooperation to promote trade between the two countries. On Ministers inquiry on the proposed FTA and dates for the second Sub Committee Meeting on Trade Related Matters, the Thai side mentioned that they will be completing the feasibility study on FTA by August this year and the dates for the second Sub Committee Meeting will be informed.
Minister Bathiudeen requested technical assistance in gem and jewellery, food processing, agriculture, electronics, automobile components.
The Thai Commerce Minister said the Thai government will continue support for jewellery designing and will check with the Ministry of Interior for cooperation in OTOP Projects and also provide support to identify companies to invest in dried fruits areas in Sri Lanka.

SLC selects Jaffna for new International Cricket Stadium
Giving every outstanding cricketer a just and fair opportunity to represent Sri Lanka is the underlying theme of Sri Lanka Crickets ambitious National Development Plan for 2017.
To achieve this, the current SLC administration strongly believes that the development of the provincial cricket infrastructure and proper stadium facilities will uplift the standards of the school and local club cricket. This area had been ignored by the authorities for many years and a carefully designed plan is underway to remedy these challenges in a professional manner.
Out of the two ear-marked projects for this year, special attention is given for the proposed Jaffna International Cricket Stadium.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala along with the SLC officials embarked on a visit to Jaffna peninsula, last weekend.
They were accompanied by government officials, provincial and District Cricket Association members, technical support staff and Jaffna police during the site inspection tour. It was heartening to note the warm co-operation extended by the officials of the Chief Minister of Northern Province C.V. Wigneswaran as he was out of the country.
The identified two plots of land for this venture would be scrutinized by a qualified technical evaluation team to ascertain the quality of the basic requirements such as water, soil, power, environmental impact, road access etc.
The SLC president stressed the importance of selecting the most suitable and viable location with other important facilities to the players and general public such as easy access to the location, welfare, safety, facilities. He explained the unseen difficulties of maintaining the green grass and playing strips throughout the year and the recurrent expenditure involved for maintenance.
Later on Saturday a meeting was held in Jaffna with the provincial administrators of cricket, district coaches and support staff along with all the club officials. The SLC president explained the new National Development Plan and his vision to see more young talented cricketers joining the main stream as they will be given a fair opportunity with the best of facilities. Commenting further on this national project the SLC president added that Jaffna has historically produced exceptionally talented cricketers and this could be the first step towards bringing back the past glory not only to this beautiful peninsula but also to the whole of Northern Province.
The cricket administrators of the North gave a rousing applause to the SLC presidents comments and accepted the challenge to groom and nurture their youngsters into the national pool.
SLC has decided to set aside a budget of Rs 100 million to initiate this project in 2017 which would be completed by August 2022 will serve as a common goal for One Team One Nation.

Supreme Court grants leave to proceed
The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights application filled by the Lankaputhra Development Bank Chairman against the Central Bank.
A two-judge Bench headed by the Chief Justice granted leave to proceed in the fundamental rights application filed by Lankaputhra Development Bank Limited (LDBL) Chairman Lasantha Goonewardena, against a decision of the Central Bank Director, Bank Supervision (DBS).
The application challenges the determination of the Director Bank Supervision that Goonewardena cannot be considered as a fit and proper person to function as Chairman for disclosing information about the status of the bank at a press conference and for engaging in direct management functions.
Senior Counsel Harsha Fernando, appearing on behalf of Petitioner Goonewardena submitted that under the Baking Act, the DBS has no authority to remove a Chairman. He said that section 42 of the Act only deals with Directors of Bank and the DBS has been acting completely outside the law by attempting to remove the Chairman.
He warned that if regulatory decisions are taken in this manner affecting reputations and employment prospects of key management personnel, the financial sector stability would be affected. Refuting the allegations made against the Chairman, he further submitted that the Petitioner only participated at the press conference referred to by the DBS at the request of the Finance Minister.
Press conference was called by the Minister to inform the public of the parlous situation of the bank when the new management took over and the steps now being taken to improve its financial status.
That, he said, is necessary to rebuild confidence in LDBL. He submitted that all actions of Goonewardena in direct management was as a member of the Board appointed Committees and subject to its overall direction. The petitioner continues to be a director of LDBL.
The Additional Solicitor General, appearing on behalf of the Central Bank, said that a number of new recruitment have been made by the Chairman and several other instance of breach of Central Bank directives have been highlighted in an examination conduced by the Bank Supervision Department that led to the removal of the Petitioner as Chairman.
Attorney-at-Law Harsha Fernando with Shanil Perera, Chamith Senanayaka and Natashiya Noordeen instructed by Jagath Thalgaswattage appeared for the petitioner. Senior Additional Solicitor General, Sanjay Rajarathnam, PC appeared for the Central Bank. The Court fixed the case for argument on May 3 on top of the list.

## Title: Surfs up!

Surfs up!
They are engaged in a livelihood that involves saving people from strong swells and rough conditions at the risk of their own lives on the beaches. Often dubbed as a dangerous job in paradise, surf lifesaving is a multifaceted movement that comprises key aspects of voluntary lifeguard services. It is also a competitive surf sport. Originating in the early 20th century Australia, the movement has expanded globally to other countries including New Zealand, Ireland, South Africa, the United Kingdom and Asia.
In Sri Lanka surf life saving is still a lesser known fact but surf life savers do exist. They save a countless number of lives from danger every year. Kalana Perera has taken up this challenge and is now a skilled voluntary surf life saver attached to the The Life Saving Association of Sri Lanka (LSASL). A student of Nalanda College, Colombo, Kalana has won many accolades for swimming, a passion which he put to good use by saving lives on the beach.
Q: How did you get into surf life saving
A: I did swimming from grade one at Nalanda College. I joined life saving at grade eight in 2009 but I have been a member of the college swimming team since 2004. I obtained the bronze award as a surf life saver in 2010 from the LSASL. Nalanda College Life Saving Club is in charge of a certain area on Mount Lavinia beach.
Children who are above 15 are eligible to become surf life savers. Nalanda pioneered the life saving sport among schools in Sri Lanka. Apart from Nalanda College, Ananda College and Dharmapala College, Pannipitiya, have life saving clubs. The students have to pass a theory and practical exam before qualifying as a surf life saver. The theory exam comprises questions about the history and first aid methods linked with surf life saving while practicals encompass Simulated Emergency Response Competition (SERC) tests where we have to do demonstrations as well as swim about 400m in the sea.
The first step into become a surf life saver is to obtain the basic life saving certificate. That is the foundation. Next you have to get the intermediate certificate. If you have won the bronze medal that means that you are a globally accepted surf life saver. However this has to be renewed every two years because surf life savers have to be update on the information and methods linked with the field.
Q: Can anyone who can swim become a good life saver
A: No. There are instances in which swimmers too can drown at times. A life saver should have a good stamina. Apart from good swimming skills he or she should have the ability to run fast as well as have the knowledge on how to act in certain situations.
Q: What should one possess to become a good surf life saver
A: There is no special feature but you need to have at least the basic knowledge in swimming. There are many categories of life savings around the world like ice rescue, fire fighters etc. We have serf rescue in Sri Lanka. Possessing leadership qualities is an added bonus because the surf life saver can excel in his task. What really stands out is the persons ability to act according to the situation.
Q: Is surf life saving a profession
A: One can become a professional life guard but since we are still schooling, we are volunteers. Therefore we are known as life savers. This is something that is not quite recognized as a profession in Sri Lanka yet. We are in charge of the coastal areas in the sea rather than going deep into the sea. We mostly rescue swimmers.
Q: How is life saving categorized as a sport
A: There are two categories in life saving. They are life saving as a duty and life saving as a sport. It has a humanitarian purpose as a sport with the purpose of training better life savers and life guards. The life saving sports primary intention is to encourage life savers to develop, maintain and improve the essential physical and mental skills needed to save lives in the aquatic environment. The sport consists of a series of competition disciplines intended to further develop and demonstrate lifesaving skills, fitness and motivation.
Q: Tell us about your experience at Rescue 2014.
A: The competition was held in Montpellier, France. Our team won ninth place at the mans beachflags (youth category) event. Competitors start off from a prone starting position on the beach, rise, turn and race to obtain a beach flag buried upright in the sand 20m away. Since there are always fewer batons than competitors, those who fail to obtain a baton are eliminated in the game.
A team made up of 12 members represented Sri Lanka at Rescue 2014 in the open and youth (under 19) categories. I was part of the under 19 national youth team. There were six members in our team: Dilanka Shehan, Senal Hasintha, Rusiru Praveen, Dinith Pabasara, Dhanushka Hansaka and myself. More than 85 countries took part in the event.
Q: How is life saving accepted around the world
A: t is a well recognized profession in most of the foreign countries. They are given a lot of facilities and have sponsors as well.
Q: What is your most memorable experience linked with surf life saving
A: There are many unofficial incidents. Once around six swimmers clung onto me during a rescue. That was scary but we managed to pull them through. On several occasions we managed to save people who would have drowned if we had not gotten to them in the nick of time.
Every moment is a new experience in surf life saving. You have to be dedicated to the task because another persons life is in your hands.
Q: Tell us a bit about your family.
A: My father is L G S Perera. He is a businessman. My mother, J W P Mangalika, is a housewife. I am the only child in my family.
Q: Would you choose to be a life saver even in the future
A: I wish to continue with my sports activities even in the future. I was captain of the Nalanda Swimming Team for 2014/2015 and I have achieved many merits and colours for swimming as well as life saving. I am already selected for the national pool. We have two tours in South Africa and New Zealand planned for this year. The selections for the international competitions are in March.
Q: What is your advice to other youth who would like to become surf life savers
A: I am a Buddhist so I believe that saving anothers life is a meritorious activity. Anyone who is a strong swimmer can undergo the examination to qualify as a surf life guard. You just have to have good swimming skills, the interest and dedication to enter this field.

Traditional ways of food preservation highlighted
Drought is expected to create a future food shortage, Therefore, it is imperative for the people to be vigilant about this threat and begin to prevent unnecessary wastage of food, Hambantota Inter-province Assistant Director of Agriculture Nalika Rubasinghe said. She said it behoves housewives particularly to ensure that only the required quantity of food items are prepared for the household meals without cooking in excess which will go waste. The immense wastage of food currently taking place could be adduced by looking into the dustbins placed in workplaces, canteens, hotels and restaurants, she said.

Ven Athureliye's contradictions
Ven Athureliye Rathana is not a monk who makes political waves like in the case of the late Ven Maduluwawe Sobitha, who, throughout his ordained life, made great efforts to transform the national polity and resurrect it from the pits it had fallen into. However as a member of the Jathika Hela Urumaya, which is the first Bikkhu body that entered parliamentary politics, the Ven Athureliya gained prominence for his strong sentiments on behalf of the country's Buddhists and his advocacy of a righteous Sri Lanka.
But the JHU, along with the Ven Rathana, was soon to learn that parliament was not exactly the right forum to carry out its reforms mission. The party was subject to a baptism of fire, so to speak, on its very first day in parliament where the Bikkhu members of the JHU were roughed up, ending with the Ven Kotikawatte Sri Sumangala being admitted to hospital. None of this setbacks were to deter the Ven Rathana though, who continued to be a strong voice in parliament against injustice and oppression of the state and what he perceived to be internal and external threats to Buddhism. It is on the basis of the latter and what he saw as Indian expansionism that the Ven Thera and the JHU decided to throw in their lot with Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2005.
The JHU, though, when it saw that Rajapaksa was deviating from the policies and undertakings agreed to, decided to throw in its lot with the Common Candidate, with the exception of a few monks such as the Ven Ellawela Medhananda, who stayed put with Rajapaksa.
Much water had flown under the bridge since then and today the Ven Athureliya appears to have adopted the same stance he took with regard to Rajapaksa in 2005, holding the government to its pledges to the people and opting to sever ties with the regime after admitting to be disillusioned by the path pursued by it. Noble as the Ven Thera's intentions are for the country, some of his demands are not in sync with what is good for the country in terms of its economic health and future progress.
One of Ven Thera's demands is for the cancellation of the Hambantota port project and to stay the ECTA agreement with India. Strangely, Ven Athureliya is against the government antagonizing India by the influx of Chinese investments to the country. This, by a movement which was openly hostile to India not so long ago and its raison d etre for supporting Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2005.
The Ven. Thera's professed mission to steer the government on the correct path, through a National Council he intends setting up, should not impinge on the economic strategies of the government that would benefit the country. In no way should this Council play the role of a pressure group to stymie the government's economic plans. Policy decisions affecting the economy should be strictly the province of the government.
Be that as it may, Ven. Rathana is still an advisor of the President and while being so he cannot run with the hare and hunt with the hound. He is, after all, a member of parliament nominated on the National List and as such has no moral right to make statements that would embarrass the government. The Ven. Thera is also full of contradictions. While saying that his movement is not a political party he says they have not yet decided on contesting the Local Government Elections. A Presidential Election will be an entirely different ball game, he asserts. Also while saying that Mahinda Rajapaksa was a spent force, the Ven Thera nevertheless invites all political forces to join his movement which he asserts is not a political entity.
Which begs the question. Can President Sirisena hope to have, as his special advisor, an individual, a Bikkhu notwithstanding, who has deemed that his (President's) Government is on the wrong path, failed to fulfill its promises and that he (Ven Athureliya) has decided to leave that self same government and sit as an Independent in parliament since the government has not taken steps to mend its ways Can he also afford to have, as his adviser, a person who has all but attacked the government's economic policies by calling for the scrapping of the Hambantota port project and the proposed ETCA agreement Can the President also have Ven Athureliya as his advisor after the latter had decided to leave his government and sit as an Independent MP in parliament, where, in time to come, will permit him the opportunity to make common cause with the Joint Opposition
What is the legal position of Ven Rathana's exit from the UNP, from which party he was appointed as a National List MP Will the UNP seek legal recourse to unseat the Ven Thera, which is unlikely, given the backlash this would invite Or in the case of legal action being taken, will the Ven.Thera resort to the beaten track and claim he is still a member of the UNP though sitting as an Independent

Violent speak
The Institute of National Security Studies Sri Lanka (INSSSL) successfully concluded yet another Security Salon recently at the Defence Ministry premises chaired by Eng Karunasena Hettiarachchi. The guest speaker on the occasion was Indra de Soysa, Professor of Political Science at the Norwegian Institute of Science and Technology whose presentation on Violent Conflict: using theory to guide Sri Lankas Defense Policy enraptured the audience of scholars, practitioners, diplomats, and senior military officers alike as it was an extremely important and relevant topic to Sri Lankas security landscape.
The speakers presentation was on the latest research on the causes of civil war that addresses the fundamental question of why people engage in this very costly form of behaviour when less costly bargains are always possible. He began by giving an empirical overview of the patterns of conflict around the world, where the bulk of organised armed violence happens as intrastate wars whereas interstate wars are all but absent.
The speaker laid out the fundamental theoretical precepts and the underlying causes of civil war. He outlined how theoretical logic points to the fact that armed violence occurs because of opportunity or feasibility rather than for reasons of motive alone. Conflict is organised for private gain rather than as a public good.
Prof. de Soysa also shows that exogenous factors rather than purely domestic factors are decisive in many civil wars where regional and superpower power politics play a role. Understanding properly the sources of armed violence can lead to intelligent policymaking for securing Sri Lankas domestic and foreign policy interests.
Make violence more feasible
Interestingly, the speaker challenged the dominant views on conflict such as grievances and lack of social, cultural and political rights by denying the concept of ethnic conflict. Conversely, he supported the theory of opportunity over grievances and other endogenous factors. The opportunity, not the grievance alone being of significance simply because there are many groups that are downtrodden and never rise up, this being relevant to academics and policymakers as they can better apply policies to try to prevent those factors that make violence more feasible.
Financial capability was also shown as a binding constraint as conflict is costly in terms of labour and other resources and plays a decisive role on their opportunity of survival against organised state forces.
It was also interesting that he singled out countries such as India and Sri Lanka that have relative openness in their political processes as more likely, not less likely, to be faced with rebellion or conflict compared to countries such as North Korea that has no political space for organising dissent, hence a very slim chance of conflict.
Low state capacity was also a factor that was said to favour conflict, thus the reason for Sri Lanka being conflict prone in the 1970s and 80s with relatively low state capacity to counter insurgency. Financing and training of rebel groups by external powers was also elucidated proving the point that at times exogenous factors outweigh the endogenous ones. Territory and rough terrain being yet another element that contributes to conflict was highlighted with examples of the Sea Tigers in Sri Lanka and the Al Qaeda in Afghanistan, both groups that favoured territories they were familiar with and considered a safe haven. The role of geo-politics too cannot be ignored as regional powers and super powers as a part of their agenda, offer support to rebels fighting civil wars.
National security
As reasons for the Sri Lankan governments eventual success in defeating the LTTE, the speaker alluded to high state capacity and the growth of per capita income over the years. In terms of securing peace in the future, Prof. de Soysa ruled out a complete military solution by bringing to attention that the geo-political positioning of Sri Lanka could pose dangers if the countrys policies are not aligned with that of superpowers.
The far bigger threat to national security as he perceives is a non-violent movement for a cause along the lines of a separate state, which if properly financed and motivated around an objective can pose a serious threat to national security. In this respect, a defence policy of good governance and good political processes that will marginalise or counter any element favouring conflict albeit non violent.
During the discussion that followed, some of the issues that were brought up dated back in history to instances of discriminating the Tamil community by the national language act and standardisation of universities followed by the riots in1983 which was a major turning point in their mistrust of the government.
As regards ensuring peace in the present context, there were assurances that the present government was well aware of what needs to be done to address the issues of the people in this country and has already taken necessary steps in this direction, by ensuring that justice is being met in all aspects with equal access to resources, education and other spheres.
Tamil political leaders
The question of the diaspora being more active in Europe and other countries promoting the now obsolete slogan of separatism was highlighted as a cause for concern.
However, these activities of the diaspora were branded as what has now become a franchise without which the survival and funding of many interested parties would cease to exist. It was suggested that the more moderate elements of the diaspora could be roped in by the government of Sri Lanka in order to marginalise the radical elements of the same.
The creation of a diaspora investment fund was suggested as means of gaining their trust.
Consequently, the need for a new approach to change the discourse of politics to be more aligned with the inclusion of Tamil political leaders was highlighted as something that should form an integral part of the political discussion and processes in the country. Proximity of India and its interest in Sri Lankas politics was an aspect that was also suggested as requiring the highest priority in Sri Lankas foreign policy.
Another important comment was that state capacity and the states ability not to be hijacked by any group of the population should be ensured by applying the rule of law across the board, with the adoption of certain hard political decisions by which the rule of law will be applied to all parties. Through this, the government could gain the trust and confidence of its citizens to ensure that everybody lives with dignity.

Right to Information Act will be implemented within three months
The Right to Information Act will be implemented within three months after gazetting it on February 3, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatileka said addressing an awareness programme on the Right to Information Act at Tangalle Saman hotel.
He said information officials were appointed for 50 institutions and only two institutions remain to be appointed with officials. The minister said police station can manage without an information official since OICs will be appointed for the post. The Right to Information Act will help journalists immensely to carry out their duties.
Media villages will be set up in each district to provide housing facilities to provincial journalists at a subsidy rate, he said. A land in Colombo was identified to set up a housing complex for journalists in the Colombo district. He said a land belonging to the SLBC was selected, but it was found later that its ownership had changed unknown to the SLBC.
Twenty five houses will be set up in each media village at the initial stage, and Housing Minister Sajith Premadasa extended his and his ministry fullest co-operation towards this worthy task, the minister said. Some people misunderstand that the media persons are only those who reside in Colombo. Provincial journalists too report many important incidents and when new identity cards are issued, they do not get due recognition, he said.

Angelo confident of bouncing back, says SLC president
Bouncing back graciously from a crushing defeat, Sri Lankas young Test team led by captain Angelo Mathews engaged in a lengthy discussion with president of Sri Lanka Cricket Thilanga Sumathipala yesterday afternoon. During the meeting, the captain affirmed his teams commitment to re-strategize for the upcoming T20 and ODI series in South Africa.
The SLC president convened this emergency meeting at Sri Lanka Cricket headquarters with the participation of vice-presidents Jayantha Dharmadasa and K. Mathivanan along with chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriya, coach Graham Ford, captain Mathews, team manager Ranjith Fernando, chairman of cricket committee Aravinda de Silva, SLC secretary Mohan de Silva and High Performance manager Simon Willis.
Angelo is confident of bouncing back and winning the series, SLC president said following the meeting.
We believe that if you are afraid of losing, you can never have a winning team.
While accepting and agreeing the team slip-ups and challenges faced during the recent Test series, captain Mathews remained confident with regard to the white-ball challenge asserting that the team will give their best to secure a win for the country.
The meeting according to officials of SLC, helped boost the morale of the team after having been defeated by the South Africans on foreign soil.
Sri Lanka has generally struggled to cope with the pace and seam of South Africas pitches, but they now have another opportunity to make a fresh beginning with a young team. South Africa and Australia are said to be among the two toughest places to tour for Sri Lanka, In 20 Tests in those countries, Sri Lanka have lost 17, and won just one - in Durban in the 2011 Boxing Day Test.
The other two big Asian teams India and Pakistan have also struggled in these countries.
India and Pakistan have a few more wins. India have also played twice as many Tests as Sri Lanka in these two countries, which has obviously given their players a better chance to adapt.
The difference between Sri Lankas batting and bowling averages are almost 21, which indicates how hopelessly outmatched they have been in these Tests.

Army condemns LC Heenbandas protest at Fort railway station
Lance Corporal H. A. Heenbandas protest at the Fort Railway station on Monday is meant to publicly ridicule the Army and tarnish its image, the army said.
LC Heenbanda who was rendered disabled during the war was posted to the Yakkala Ranaviru Apparels factory for light duties as a subject clerk for accounts, related to the Sahana Welfare Loan project. During an Internal Audit conducted by the Directorate of the Army, discovered a financial discrepancy in the Sahana Welfare Loan project necessitating the appointment of a Court of Inquiry to investigate the matter.
Investigations confirmed both the officer-in-charge of the Sahana Welfare Loan project accounts and Lance Corporal Heenbanda were directly responsible for the financial fraud, committed through the preparation of forged name lists of his fellow-soldiers in the factory. During interrogations and his evidence, the Court of Inquiry recommended recovering Rs 465,525 from Heenbanda, which was re-affirmed in the Commanders conclusions. Heenbanda had paid Rs 250,000 to the Yakkala Ranaviru Apparels, of the total missing sum. He had received a 50 percent disability category in the Medical Board and had gone on retirement with a monthly salary plus a disability pension of Rs 65,597.56 on August 26, 2013. Steps were taken to deduct the balance dues of Rs 215,252 from his gratuity payments, and he was subsequently intimated verbally and also in writing to report back to his mother unit for preparation of his final clearance process and settlement of outstanding issues.

## Title: Baptism by fire for Lankan young uns

Baptism by fire for Lankan young uns
The recently concluded three-Test series against South Africa was a fiery baptism for Sri Lankas young batsmen who were all at sea against some top class fast bowling - the likes of which some had never encountered in their brief careers thus far.
What that series taught them was that runs against that class of bowling was never easy to come by and unlike in the subcontinent where the ball rarely swings or bounces - in conditions they were up against the name of the game was endurance, which they clearly lacked.
The deficiencies in inexperience obviously showed during the series and if the young uns have learnt from that bitter experience then Sri Lanka should not be disappointed with their 0-3 whitewash, if not they have a long hard struggle ahead of them playing overseas.
That only three of the batsmen managed to get past a half-century mark just showed how dominant the opposition bowlers were. They simply preyed on the weaknesses of the Lankan batsmen probing constantly outside the off stump and testing them with short-pitched deliveries that sometimes reared off a good length which to say the least, the batsmen clearly displayed their incapableness.
Sri Lanka had their chance in the first Test at Port Elizabeth where the pitch was best suited for them than at Cape Town or Johannesburg, but they failed to capitalize on it. Had they done so the performance would have given them more confidence to tackle the South African fast bowlers for the rest of the series.
Prior to departing to South Africa head coach Graham Ford confided that if Sri Lanka was to perform well in South Africa the top three batsmen had to deliver, if not they would be in trouble. Well that didnt happen and we all know the result.
The top three in the order were Dimuth Karunaratne, Kaushal Silva and the elusive number three position which Sri Lanka has yet to plug following the retirement of the great Kumar Sangakkara. It is said that the number three position is occupied by the best batsman in the team and at present Sri Lanka does not have anyone to fill that spot. Against a high class bowling attack as the one the South Africans have especially in their conditions one cannot experiment with the all-important number 3 position. Sri Lanka went to South Africa with no clear idea of who would play in that position.
They tried Kusal Perera for the first Test and he clearly didnt look the part especially with his loose stroke play. What that position required was a solid batsman in the mould of an Anura Tennekoon, an Asanka Gurusinha or a Kumar Sangakkara - not a stroke player who flashes his blade at each and every delivery and tries to commit hara-kiri.
For the next two Tests Kusal Mendis was promoted to number three and although he batted with some conviction it is early days to confirm whether that is the permanent position for him.
Promoting Dhananjaya de Silva to number four was a good move but after Angelo Mathews at five and Dinesh Chandimal at six, the number seven slot is again open to either Upul Tharanga or Kusal Perera. Perera at seven is a better bet than at three.
With captain Mathews and his deputy Chandimal, the two most experienced batters in the side failing to put runs on the board one could not expect the rest of the team with less experience than the top two to perform.
Mathews managed just 178 runs from six innings which was the most by a Sri Lankan and Chandimal a disappointing 85 in as many.
While the batting was a disaster the same cannot be said of the bowling. Teenager Lahiru Kumara and Suranga Lakmal were the standout players for Sri Lanka in the series. Lakmal the spearhead of Sri Lanka for several years finally achieved his first five-for in a Test innings and throughout the series bowled consistently without much luck at times. His 12 wickets is only the second time he has achieved a double figure haul in a Test series, the first being a similar haul against Pakistan in the UAE in 2014.
Kumara is the real find in the series for Sri Lanka. For one so young at 19 Kumara displayed tremendous pace clocking 140 plus consistently, but he needs a little more experience to tighten up his bowling and make the batsmen play at every delivery. Kumara needs to be nurtured carefully and ensured that he is free of injuries which are a common occurrence amongst modern day Lankan fast bowlers.
As for South Africa they are at the moment on a roll. They were expected to steam roll Sri Lanka following their 2-1 triumph in Australia and they lived upto that prediction. Although their batting at times wavered their bowlers delivered from the top drawer. Philander, Rabada, Abbott, Parnell and Olivier were simply unplayable at times and gave the Lankan batsmen a torrid time in the middle.
They hardly made South Africa feel the absence of Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel from the firing line. Very rarely does a Man of the Series go to a bowler and on this occasion it was won by South African opener Dean Elgar who aggregated 308 for an average of 61.

Battle between super and rising powers
Before the formation of the National Unity Government after the Presidential elections and the Parliamentary elections in 2015, the foreign policy decision makers in Sri Lanka had made very serious errors and miscalculations in taking foreign policy decisions. These foreign policy errors have resulted in the USA and other Western states and also India, our closest neighbour, adopting an antagonistic attitude towards Sri Lanka.
After the defeat of the Rajapaksa regime, the National Unity Government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe have taken some corrective steps which have contributed to the restoration of the cordial and friendly relationship with the western countries and also India while continuing to strengthen the friendly relationship with states such as Pakistan, China and Russia that supported the Rajapaksa regime by extending economic, political and military support in diverse manner.
Sri Lankas foreign policy
In this article, I am attempting to examine why the USA and other Western countries and India with which Sri Lanka had a very cordial relationship and supported the peace process facilitated by Norway with a very strong sense of commitment, later changed their attitude to Sri Lanka and adopted a hostile attitude. I will also discuss the corrective steps the present government has taken to reorient Sri Lankas foreign policy for the restoration of the cordial relationship with all countries, specially the Great Powers and the Rising Powers both in the West and in the East and how far the Sri Lankan government has succeeded in its attempt to do so. I have also focused on the challenges that the National Unity Government is confronted with in balancing its relations with India and China, the two Asian neighbours.
After the end of the war, President Rajapaksa expressed his commitment to initially attend to the most urgent needs of rehabilitation and resettlement of the displaced persons and reconstructing damaged infrastructure facilities. The Sri Lankan government also gave an undertaking to India and to the international community that it would take steps, as a priority matter, to make necessary amendments and implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution for making the devolution of power to the Provincial Councils meaningful. However, India and international community realized that the Rajapaksa administration lacked the political will to negotiate a political settlement with the Tamil leaders.
Withdrawal of support from the West
The Western democratic countries that supported the Sri Lankan government during the peace-process facilitated by Norway, brought to the attention of the United Nations the allegations of serious violations of human rights of the civilians and also allegations of war crimes during the war. They insisted on the need for investigating these allegations both against the Sri Lankan government and the LTTE.
The Sri Lankan governments position was that what the Sri Lankan armed forces were engaged in was a humanitarian operation, all necessary steps had been taken for the protection of civilians and war crimes were not committed by the Sri Lankan armed forces and therefore there was no need to hold any investigations against the Sri Lankan military forces. The USA and other democratic states that took the initiative for bringing this issue of violation of human rights of the civilians and also war crimes by armed forces were supported by the Indian government. By doing so, the Indian government indicated its disappointment with the Sri Lankan governments failure to understand and address the legitimate grievances of the Sri Lankan Tamil community. What was required, after the completion of the war was addressing the root causes of the conflict. But the leaders of the Rajapaksa government argued that what Sri Lanka experienced during the last thirty years was only a terrorist problem and not an ethnic conflict.
This position of the Sri Lankan government disappointed not only the Tamil community in Sri Lanka it also irritated the Tamil community and their leaders in Tamil Nadu. It has been an aspect of the political culture in Tamil Nadu that some political problems of the Tamil community in Sri Lanka became political issues in Tamil Nadu politics. With the return to power of Chief Minister Jayalalitha and her AIADMK party in 2011, the State government urged New Delhi to increase pressure on the Rajapakse government on a range of issues including alleged war crimes and the continued hardships faced by the Tamils in the North and East.
The pro-LTTE political parties in Tamil Nadu and their political leaders accuse Sri Lankan government of war crimes during the final stage of the war. There were several anti-Sri Lanka protests and demonstrations in Tamil Nadu in 2012 and 2013. There were also several attacks on Sri Lankan pilgrims who visited India, organised by some Tamil Nadu politicians. It was due to the influence of Tamil Nadu politics and also Indiaa alliance with the USA and other democratic counties in the West that India supported the USA initiated resolutions in the UNHRC in Geneva in the years 2012 and 2013 against Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka found itself confined to a very precarious situation after India openly supported the resolutions.
In addition to passing resolutions in the UNHRC based in Geneva, the Western countries had suspended providing economic assistance to Sri Lanka. But the reoriented foreign policy perspectives of the present government have contributed to the resumption of financial assistance by these countries.
The Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, in his economic policy statement in Parliament in October 2016, stated that along with the IMF, the World Bank, the Asian Development Bank and lending institutions of the USA, Europe and Japan have now expressed their willingness to lend Sri Lanka funds at considerable low rates of interest. He stated that the last time such funds were made available to Sri Lanka was between 2001-2004 when he was the Prime Minister. He further stated that in 2003 the application process for GSP+ facility was initiated. This concession of entry into EU markets extended to the garment industry in Sri Lanka was immensely beneficial to Sri Lanka. But, Sri Lanka lost the GSP+ incentive in 2010.
Referring to the progressive steps that the National Unity Government has already taken to revive the cordial relationship that Sri Lanka enjoyed with the Western democratic countries, the Prime Minister, in his economic statement to Parliament further stated: During the last year the President Maithripala Sirisena and I have travelled to key destinations with an objective of reviving the interest in Sri Lanka. During my recent visit to Brussels, the officials of the European Commission expressed their confidence that the GSP + trade concession would be given favourable consideration. The Japanese Prime Minister has also appointed a senior official to especially coordinate the Japanese - Sri Lanka Joint Comprehensive Partnership Programme. Towards creating newer markets for our exports, we are also negotiating three trade agreements, ETCA with India and two FTAs with China and Singapore.
During the last session of the UNHRC in Geneva, Sri Lanka co-sponsored the resolution for setting up a transitional justice mechanism because the government believed that holding such an impartial investigation regarding the serious allegations of humanitarian law and war crimes was an essential step for achieving reconciliation among the different communities in Sri Lanka.
The obvious fact is that the United Nations was intervening in Sri Lanka on behalf of a minority community, the Tamil community who strongly feel that their rights have been seriously violated during the course of the war and they have appealed to the UN through their agents for intervention. The UN has an obligation to intervene in an internal conflict in a state where a weaker party to a conflict is subjected to inhuman treatment or genocide by the armed forces of the government.
Dependence on China for managing the economic crisis
The state of isolation that the Rajapaksa government was confined to, internationally, compelled the government to seek the support of China for implementing many development projects planned by the government. The most important projects for which China extended its support were the construction of the harbour at Hambantota and the airport at Mattala close to the harbour.
The harbour and the airport at Hambantota were constructed in a strategically very important location as far as the interests of China are concerned. It is a well known fact that China has already constructed harbours at several strategically important locations in the Indian Ocean. These harbours are viewed as pearls in the string of pearls strategy aimed at increasing its control over the Indian Ocean. Indian leaders and diplomats have occasionally voiced their concern regarding China increasing its involvement in the development projects in Si Lanka  especially the strategically significant projects like the construction of harbours and airports. China had also financially supported the construction of some highways.
Another strategically important development project is the Colombo Port City, now called Colombo International Financial City project. It is a Megapolis built adjacent to the Colombo port by reclaiming land from the sea. It appears that when these high profile projects were planned the financial viability of the projects had not been taken into consideration. They can be considered as merely image building projects of the former head of the state  Mahinda Rajapaksa.
During the Presidential election propaganda campaign in 2015, Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to the electorate that he would stop the building of the Colombo Port City and, accordingly, just after the election, the Chinese construction company was directed to discontinue the construction work.
The construction work had been suspended for several months, but after fresh negotiations with the Chinese government, the construction company was permitted to resume construction work. According to the agreement signed with the Chinese company, China has to provide the capital for the construction of the Port City and Sri Lanka has to compensate for Chinas financial contribution by allocating a part of the city to be used by china on a 99 year lease.
For overcoming the problem of making the Hambantota harbour a financially viable enterprise and also the problem of repayment of loans obtained from China with interest, the government happened to seek the assistance of China again and sign an agreement with the China Merchants Port Holdings Company. According to this partnership agreement, 80% of the port ownership would be vested with China Merchants Port Holdings Company and the balance 20% will be held by the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. According to the proposed agreement a certain extent of land belonging to the port will be leased to the said company for 99 years. The government has also agreed to lease a large extent of land to the same Chinese company from the Southern Province for the development of special industrial zones.
Economic and commercial interests
India is aware that the increasing cooperation between Sri Lanka and China for development activities in Sri Lanka is motivated by economic and commercial interests only. Sri Lanka wants to maintain equally good cooperative and cordial relations with both countries. Sri Lanka is prepared to accept whatever cooperation India is prepared to extend to the economic development in Sri Lanka. In fact, India has shown a keen interest in integrated economic development with the neighbouring countries including Sri Lanka.
The Indian government, immediately after the end of the war, offered to assist the Sri Lankan government regarding the most urgent needs of the Tamil community in the North and East who had suffered immensely as a result of the war. India provided financial assistance for implementing several projects for rehabilitation and reconstruction. India had extended financial assistance for reconstructing roads and railway lines and also 50,000 houses for the displaced families. Another project undertaken by India is the construction of the coal power plant at Sampur.
The Sri Lankan government and the Indian government have started discussions regarding many other projects in which Indian investors can cooperate. Sri Lanka has also shown a keen interest in signing the proposed Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) without much delay. Some sections of the business community and professional organisations have expressed concern regarding the signing of the ETCA because of the difficulties such as non-tariff barriers experienced by the Sri Lankan businessmen in exporting their products to the Indian market. Representatives of the governments of India and Sri Lanka have already started intensive discussions regarding such issues.
China is not a threat to Indias interests in Sri Lanka
The globalization process has compelled both India and China, being rising powers in Asia, to cooperate for promotion of trade and investments and consequently China is now Indias largest trading partner in goods and both these rising powers are competing now for global markets.
Therefore, Chinas increasing involvement in development projects in Sri Lanka should not be considered as a threat to Indias security interests. Both countries, being nuclear powers, have shown pragmatism in managing their disputes without permitting them to escalate to dangerous levels.
However, Sri Lankan leaders should use their diplomacy to keep India informed of the real nature and objectives of all agreements with China to ensure that our closest neighbour, India, may not misperceive or misunderstand Chinas involvement in Sri Lanka.

## Title: The best of  Lata Mangeshkar
## Supertitle:

The best of  Lata Mangeshkar
The name Lata Mangeshkar has become a household term in most countries in the east as well as the west. Born in 1928, Lata has up to date created a world record in the field of singing songs in her mother tongue Hindi as well as in a few other languages, inclusive of Sinhala. In a recent research it is found that every three minute or so a song of Lata is heard. I am not sure if this is an exaggeration.
To her credit, she has sung about 35,000 to 40,000 songs. She has spent all her time devoted to music. As I remember as a schoolboy, I saw the Hindi film Madhuvanthi eight times, perhaps enamoured by the enchanting singing quality on the part of Lata and the appearance of the two brilliant performers Vijanthi Mala and Dilip Kumar. Then in the film Mother India, Lata happened to be the playback singer for nurses where the song Nagari Nagari Dware Dware is still resonating in my ears.
With all these serious and enchanting episodes, the sensitive artiste behind is recalled as Lata Mangeshkar without whom it was popularly believed that there was no charm and mesmerism in sound. She had sung songs for the melodies created by musicals such as Noushad, Shankar and Jikishan and S D Barman to name a few. In one of their biographies I read I came to know that Lata was splendid in her day to day actions as devoted to her function as a singer.
When once questioned by me about the voice of Lata I still remember what the late Maestro Amaradeva had to say.
Latas voice is simply divine, for there is no equal.
I wanted to clarify what he meant by divine.
Then said the maestro: Perhaps there is a layer of mystic touch in her range of singing which cannot be explained in laymens terms.
My mind goes back to 1993/1994 when I spent sometime in Dollis Hill in London where I had the habit of going to a close by library. This is an area where quite a lot of most communities from India and Pakistan lived. Dollis Hill Library was crowded with Lata Mangeskar fans, as she was schooled to pay a visit to meet and that with them. At the entrance to the library auditorium I saw a life size portrait of Lata Mangeskar. The visitors were made to hear the old hits of Lata such as Ayega from the film Makel. The fans were seen eagerly waiting for Lata with flowers and other gifts.
When Lata arrived with a group of fans, there was a loud applause I merriment. She spoke a few words in Hindi. She was greeted with garlands. I had the opportunity of having a brief glance and a chat with the singer Lata. But it was a busy programme. She had to move from city to city in various part of the UK. It is stated that she is not so quite fond of travelling and meeting people.
But part of her earnings from singing at home and abroad have been deposited as charity. During a visit to India recently I was informed that Lata has built a hospital with all the medical facilities one could imagine of. She loves children despite the fact that she remains an unmarried woman. When the media persons question her on her aspect of love, I am married to music. Music makes me love all types of people ranging from children to adults.
Lata had once said: I dont have rivals, but some say that I have dominated the field of singing. My humble feeling is that we need more and more of singers.
In Sri Lanka during the time of the gramophone era, where discs came to be a commercial commodity, Latas voice was imitated by a few local female singers. But how many succeeded All these random jottings go to inform just one event that falls on January 28 where a Sinhala biography of Lata will be launched at the National Library Services Auditorium in Colombo. The pioneer effort is penned by a young music teacher, Nayana Shamali Rajapaksa who is both a Sangeeth Visharada and a poetess. Her book is titled as Lata Mangeskar Age Jivitha Katawa comes out as a Godage publication.
The key chapter of Nayanas book centres round the social services rendered by Lata via the money she had earned over the years. One good example is her erection of a hospital with all the medical facilities. Perhaps it is hinted that the greatness lies not only in the skills of an artist. She has earned all the possible awards bestowed on artistes of all types. But the most interesting point is that she is stated as unmoved by felicitations at home and abroad.
The challenges she has to face come as the final factor in the work. Lata sensitively watches what happens round her in the changing aspects of the world. Some of the pseudo modernisms in the field of music have entered though she is not in a position hold them tightly. She lives happily.

Brandix accelerates  Model Village programme
The quality of life in a dozen towns and villages across Sri Lanka is looking up after the Brandix Group accelerated its model village programme in 2016 to help communities around its factories with their water supply and sanitation needs.
The countrys top ranked exporter and the largest employer in the export sector, Brandix completed multiple projects at schools, hospitals, places of worship, police stations and a community centre during the year, committing more resources and time to a project that is at the heart of the Groups community relations agenda.
Inspired by the temple, school and tank centred village development concept of yore, the Brandix programme identifies and addresses water-related issues facing people resident within a five kilometre radius of the Groups factories in its first phase, and thereafter extends its assistance to an area within a 10 kilometre radius of the factories to benefit more people in the programmes second phase.
The work involved the provision of water supply facilities to, or upgrading of existing water supply systems at 23 public institutions, the provision of both water supply and sanitation facilities to another 35 institutions and the construction or repair of sanitation facilities at ten institutions, the Group said.
The beneficiaries were 46 schools, 13 temples, a mosque and a kovil, four hospitals, two police stations and a community centre.
The simultaneous participation of 12 factories in our model village programme enabled us to reach out and help thousands of people in different parts of the country in the course of the year, said Anusha Alles, Head of CSR and Corporate Communications of the Brandix Group.
The Brandix Model Village programme focuses on assisting public institutions and communal locations by bringing communities together and building a sense of ownership that has lasting beneficial impacts.
The first Brandix Model Village programme launched in 2015 benefitted residents of Polonnaruwa, while the second programme conducted in the same year covered communities in Nivithigala.

Chief Ministers to meet MR
Chief Ministers of seven Provincial Councils are planning to meet former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to discuss a strategy for the restoration of unity among party circles in view of the upcoming Local Government polls and Provincial Council elections, Sri Lanka Freedom Party sources said. The idea of meeting the former president had come up at an unofficial discussion among provincial ministers after a formal meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena at Temple Trees recently. All seven Chief Ministers excluding Chief Ministers of Northern and Eastern Provincial Councils had taken part in the discussion. The Chief Ministers who were highly concerned about the inevitable election defeat of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party at the forthcoming elections owing to the discord in the party, decided to have a meeting with the former president to discuss about reuniting the dissenting party members. President Sirisena reportedly had not objected to the Chief Ministers idea. He had consented to go ahead with their decision.
I am in power until 2020. But you will have to face elections during this year. A division of the party will affect the party in all elections. I do not want stop you from taking any initiative to restore unity in the party, President Sirisena had reportedly responded positively to the Chief Ministers.
The Chief Ministers assigned Sabaragamuwa Chief Minister Maheepala Herath to initiate the deal with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.

Chords of harmony
Aditya Gandhi has performed across India, Scotland and United States, including venues such as the Guinness Room and Stevenson Concert Hall in Glasgow, and the Calcutta School of Music. Most recent concerts include a solo and chamber performances at Ganz Hall, in Chicago, and Alliance Francaise in Ahmedabad, and a uniquely themed Nocturnal Concert across India. Yet his most memorable concerts have been in living rooms, whose intimacy has no substitute.
Having grown up in a culture largely void of western classical music, Adityas musical creativity is born of this outside view, searching for that unique intersection between contemporary and accessible music. He believes that the universality of classical music is often obstructed by the traditional packaging we present it in. His on-going goal is to collaborate and curate art music in a way that it is more accessible and reflective of contemporary culture.
He was awarded the RCS Trust Award in 2010 and second prize at the Calcutta International Guitar Competition in 2012. Born in India, Aditya began his musical journey at quite a late age of 15. He largely self-taught the instrument before completing his Bachelors of Music with Honours from Royal Conservatoire of Scotland and his Masters of Music at the Chicago College of Performing Arts under world-renowned guitarist Denis Azabagic.
Aditya has also had the opportunity to collaborate with incredible musicians along the way. Most recent projects include a set of contemporary works with Violist Michael Schneider, and a new commission for solo guitar (inspired by Indian landscapes) by composer Jonathan Hannau. He also accompanied CCPAs production of Montiverdis lincoronazione di poppea in 2016, a unique venture for the classical guitar.
Pursuing his ambition of exposing young audiences to art music throughout India, Aditya has given frequent lectures at Greenwood High School in India, hoping to inspire more students to pursue higher education in Music and Arts. He has taught at Melody Makers Arts Academy in UAE, and given private tuition in Scotland,USA and India. Aditya has also written several papers on the music of Pierre Boulez, Toru Takemitsu and Luigi Nono, and is an avid researcher on contemporary music.
Aditya currently performs on a 2014 Sebastian Stenzel guitar. When away from the guitar, he loves to cook, watch stand-up comedy, and is an avid reader - particularly of South American and Spanish literature. He also spends hours doodling on his ukulele.

A letter most welcome
As a person who knows and understands the value of the postal service and the post offices in Sri Lanka, I highly appreciate and felt much happy about A letter to you from the Post Master General delivered to every house by the postmen on January 1 this year.
Almost all the governmental and public institutes especially, post offices, schools, temples, ministries, and educational offices have totally collapsed and deteriorated due to inefficiency, corruption and malpractices, committed by some officials and clerks employed there.
For example, how many times will a person who goes to a police station to get something done, have to keep waiting, killing much of the valuable time, until his or her job is attended to
How many times will a teacher who goes to an educational office have to wait until the necessary clerk attends to his or her work
I do suggest that all the ministry heads, department heads, principals, and chief incumbents (at temples) should take this letter as an example and think of their weaknesses, insufficient workers and try their level best to make each of their institute more people-friendly' and more and more attractive so that a better and much efficient public service (corruption free) is rendered to the general public.

The Open Competitive Examination to recruit Grade III officers to the Sri Lanka Education Administration Service will be held annually from this year, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
By holding a proper and transparent open competitive examination, the government has discontinued the earlier practice of recruiting Sri Lanka Education Administration Service (SLEAS) officers on political backgrounds and personal contacts. As a result of not holding recruitment examinations, qualified persons could not enter the SLEAS during the last regime, he said.
The minister was addressing an event to hand over appointment letters to 198 new officers to the SLEAS at the BMICH on Monday. The officers were selected on the result of open competitive examination held in 2016.
The minister said capable and suitable persons can enter the SLEAS under this government since proper recruitment mechanism is now underway annually unlike during the last regime.
The new officers will undergo one-year training prior to their appointment as Assistant Education Directors, and Subject Directors at Zonal Education Offices and as principals and deputy principals at national schools.

In a different landscape
Singer-songwriter Lasith Fernando will be releasing his debut single Mathaka Mal on January 21, 2017. He has made a name for himself as a working musician hustling the pub circuit of Colombo, performing in English.
In Mathaka Mal, a Sinhala rock song, Lasith reminisces about a love lost to the passage of time, the lingering fragrance that sits in his room, and the memories that still trail the road that he walks.
This song marks a shift into a different musical landscape, by attempting to write a song in Sinhala, while being influenced by 80s classic rock and contemporary pop-rock. His goal is to synthesize feelings into music in all their raw, honest glory.
Having mostly listened to Sinhala songs that his friends listened to or those in the theatre and on TV, his influences vary. If there is one Sinhala musician who has inspired him, it would be Amaradevas raw and visual songwriting, able to sing about something as simple as changing your sarong and it would still move you.
Growing up in his grandparents house on the outskirts of Dehiwela, Lasith remembers listening to his father playing Clarence Wijewardena and Jim Reeves cassettes, and his grandfather singing Frank Sinatra songs to himself.
Over the past three years, Lasith has been a staple of the Colombo music scene, hosting a very popular open mic amongst both musicians and pub-goers. Fostering a community of musicians who just love to entertain each other, hes found a home for himself that is built on music. Mathaka Mal will be the first song to step outside its doors into the world.
You can listen to the song online on YouTube by searching for Mathaka Mal - Lasith Fernando and purchase it at lasithfernando.bandcamp.com to support a young, local musician.

Dreaming with words
The poet is generally regarded as a dreamer, but the truth is that he is a great seer. He is both a dreamer and a seer. Our great bard, myriad minded William Shakespeare, opines that the lunatic, the poet and the lover are in the same mood. Yet, it is very interesting when we peruse through the great lines of poetry and poetic drama composed by the literary icons of universal repute to understand the current political, social, cultural, economic and other spheres of public life in the Sri Lankan context.
It seems very accurate that the poet is a dreamer. Some vociferous critics argue that the dreams of the poets remain in the realm of literary diversion. The his-story has proved beyond doubt that poetic dreaming is also accurate as that of the bridge engineers and scientists. The writer humbly believes that the dreams of the visionary poets gain ground in the long run. One should not be in a hurry to realize dreams.
A political party may take a number of decades to reach the goal of gaining power of the country. Our own traditional left has not been able to establish socialism in our country. At the present rate our radical new left may take another eon to do so. Yet they are not crestfallen. An invention is putting scientific wisdom to a dream. One need not know rocket science to understand this simple truth.
A nugget of gold could be dug out, but an automobile. A dream has to be converted into steel and a model. If an in-depth study is made into modern inventions, one could understand that poetry of yester year is todays modern magic. On this ground, one should not laugh at poets as dreamers. The harmless madness of the poet goes a long way. The poet is the specialist of the society, the path finder and the great seer. He tunes the whole word for the forward march. A wise engineer could contact a poet and get a flash of future. The poet is the dreamer and the engineer makes dream over in to fibre of tomorrow life
My concern here is not of that sort. It is true poetry. The poem for my discussion is taken from classical literature. The writer personally believes that it is opportune more than before to have a constant discussion by the rational and right thinking intellectuals to take the country out of the treacherous bog of the political and moral paralysis through classical literature. It is not a Himalayan task as it seems. The good governance cauldron seems to be at the highest boiling point and the timely interference in a classical approach would mitigate the suffering of the political mayhem.
ZIMRI, for easy reference, is considered one of the greatest political poems ever written in English poetry.It is a political satire of great universal importance. This acid criticism on a political figure was first published anon. Yet its poetic brilliance was attributed to DRYDEN not in uncertain terms. It was a time in England that a legitimate suitor to the throne was difficult to be found. But in Sri Lanka such things are not heard of. It is a feather in our cap. This powerful and direct satire was instrumental in correcting the situation in England to a certain extent. Therefore, the writer is optimistic of the same outcome even in lighter vein, here.
The celebrated first line of this poem signals the appearance of ZIMRI in the immediate development of the poetic narration.
 Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:
In the first rank of these did ZIMRI stand.
At first glance, anyone would think that ZIMRI is going to be highly praised  in the first rank.
The poet adds more in a very satirical manner.
 A man so various, that he seemed to be
Not one, but all mankinds epitome
The crux of the matter is that newly emerging ZIMRIS on the political arena of our country seem to be all knowing. They speak on anything, nothing seems alien to them. Let any political, social, economic, psychological, medical, astronomical or anything under the sun happens they are the first to open their foul mouths. The authorities on the particular subject have to get a back seat till they finish. At last nothing is talked. The beauty of this poem is that it is not raw satire, it is banter like.
The conundrum for me is that how John Dryden could imagine the real dispositions of our politicians being born in a faraway country a long time ago. The reader would be flabbergasted to know the real characteristics of ZIMRI and how akin our politicians dispositions are. I hope further understanding of the poetic vision would expand the readers outlook to know about our leaders.
Stiff in the opinion, always in the wrong,
Was everything by start and nothing long;
But, in course of one revolving moon
Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon;
Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking,
Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.
It is common knowledge in our country that some ministers, some adrenalin type politicians, pseudo intellectuals, and full-blooded patriots, literary fossils jump into hasty decisions and even go on to say that they would not stop their struggle till they unplug all the foreign lending institutions and NGOs , very ironically they themselves make a clean breast to their followers later. Most of the red brigade politicians deviate from their original political parties thinking that they would be garlanded to the presidential palace, but end in the political dustbin.

Drought relief: President calls for UN, FAO, WFP involvement
The United Nations and its affiliated bodies would take serious note of the impending drought situation in Sri Lanka and assured President Maithripala Sirisena that they would extend the fullest cooperation to the Presidential Task Force to provide relief.
Top level UN officials, including, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative, Una McCauley, the World Food Programmes (WFP) Representative and Country Director for Sri Lanka, Brenda Barton and Chief Technical Advisor at FAO Emelda Berejena called on President Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat on Monday to discuss issues pertaining to the drought and relief organisation.
The UN top officials thanked the President for establishing a Task Force to monitor and supervise drought relief and assured they would take steps to bring the impending calamity to the notice of the international community and seek their assistance.
The UN representative said as the first step, the UN could provide expertise in monitoring, evaluation and communication regarding the drought.
The WFP representative said her organisation could extend the food or cash for work programme to provide employment to rural people denied work due to the drought. She said that food/cash for work programme is in operation in several districts. Assurance of income to people would prevent them from indebtedness as there are instances of private money lenders providing the poor with loans on exorbitant interest rates. She added that the people should be encouraged to take loans from government agencies that provide soft loans.
The UN officials said one of the main problems of the drought is the drinking water shortage and that would lead to health issues. They also discussed the issue of finding bowsers to supply water to drought affected areas.
The President thanked the UN Heads for their concern over the drought situation and invited them to attend the Task Force meetings every week to further monitor the situation.

Eve of wordsmiths
The winners of the Fairway National Literary Awards 2016 were announced at a gala ceremony on the evening of January 13. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the crme of Sri Lankas academics and creative writers, publishers and literary enthusiasts, graced the glittering award ceremony, which took place at the Fairway Pavilion during the Fairway Galle Literary Festival. Fairway Holdings is the title sponsor of the Fairway Galle Literary Festival and the organizer of the Fairway National Literary Awards. The linking of local creative writing to a vibrant international literary festival offers the winners the added benefit of exposure to international critics and readers.
Dr Vivimarie Van Der Poorten
Premier Wickremesinghe warmly commended Fairway Holdings for having taken the initiative to organize and fund the Fairway National Literary Awards and expressed his delight at the significant increase in the number of entries this year, while expressing the hope that the festival will continue to draw more and more local writers. Our endeavor is to ensure that the literary talent in this country is brought out to the world. That is the target we have. We hope more of the private sector will be involved in sponsoring literary activities in this country. The Prime Minister also announced that in celebration of the 70th Annual Independence Day next year, the state would extend its patronage to the Fairway Galle Literary Festival. This is how we carve out a niche in the world. So I would like to thank Hemaka de Alwis, the Chairman of Fairway Holdings once again and I wish all the authors the very best, stated Wickremesinghe.
Theena Kumaragurunathans novel, First Utterance, was the chosen winner in the English Language category and Tennyson Pereras novel, Maha Ravana secured first place in the Sinhala category. Panjam Pilaikka Vantha by M. Sivalingam was the winner in the Tamil language category. In recognition of the effort and contribution of the publishers, who play a pivotal role in the creative process, the publishers of the winning titles were also acknowledged at the ceremony.
The Fairway National Literary Awards 2016, which recognize creative writing in all three of the national languages of Sri Lanka also coincided with the first ever National Reconciliation and Integration Week declared by President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Fairway National Literary Awards were established in 2015 and its genesis is grounded upon two notions. Firstly, while Sri Lanka has a highly literate culture with strong reading habits, creative writers nevertheless struggle with a lack of exposure and foundational support. Second was the fact that in our world of fast media turnover and internet click bait, good writing has very often failed to find the recognition it deserved.
The annual awards, which recognize exceptional creative writing in the Sinhala, Tamil and English languages in Sri Lanka, has received an overwhelming number of entries this year. The 50% increase in the number of entries across all categories suggests that the habit of reading and the creative impulse to write is stronger than ever among the Sri Lankan public.
This years panel of judges included the renowned film director Dharmasena Pathiraja, linguistic anthropologist Krishantha Fedricks, well-known short story writer Piyaseli Wijemanne, distinguished civil servant Tissa Devendra, acclaimed poet and academic Vivimarie Van Der Poorten, novelist Naomi Munaweera, Professor Emeritus Sitralega Maunagura, along with S. Pathmanathan, the former Principal of Pallaly Training school (better known as the poet and translator of Sopa) and Mohamed Abdulla, Professor of Tamil Language at the South Eastern University.
Each of the winners received a cash award of Five Hundred Thousand Rupees, while the authors shortlisted for the awards in September last year received One Hundred Thousand Rupees each.

Every successful relationship is successful because...
Hey, guess what I got married two weeks ago. And like most people, I asked some of the older and wiser folks around me for a couple quick words of advice from their own marriages to make sure my wife and I didnt hit the (same) bed. I think most newlyweds do this, especially after a few cocktails from the open bar they just paid way too much money for.
And yet they were all saying pretty much the same dozen things.
Which means that those dozen or so things must be pretty damn important and more importantly, they work.
1. Be together for the right reasons
Dont ever be with someone because someone else pressured you to. I got married the first time because I was raised Catholic and thats what you were supposed to do. Wrong. I got married the second time because I was miserable and lonely and thought having a loving wife would fix everything for me. Also wrong. Took me three tries to figure out what should have been obvious from the beginning, the only reason you should ever be with the person youre with is because you simply love being around them. It really is that simple.
 Greg
2. Have realistic expectations about relationships and romance
You are absolutely not going to be absolutely gaga over each other every single day for the rest of your lives, and all this happily ever after nonsense is just setting people up for failure. They go into relationship with these unrealistic expectations. Then, the instant they realize they arent gaga anymore, they think the relationship is broken and over, and they need to get out. No! There will be days, or weeks, or maybe even longer, when you arent all mushy-gushy in-love. Youre even going to wake up some morning and think, Ugh, youre still here. Thats normal! And more importantly, sticking it out is totally worth it, because that, too, will change. In a day, or a week, or maybe even longer, youll look at that person and a giant wave of love will inundate you, and youll love them so much you think your heart cant possibly hold it all and is going to burst. Because a love thats alive is also constantly evolving. It expands and contracts and mellows and deepens. Its not going to be the way it used to be, or the way it will be, and it shouldnt be. I think if more couples understood that, theyd be less inclined to panic and rush to break up or divorce.
 Paula
3. The most important factor in a relationship is not communication, but respect
What I can tell you is the #1 thing, most important above all else is respect. Its not sexual attraction, looks, shared goals, religion or lack of, nor is it love. There are times when you wont feel love for your partner. That is the truth. But you never want to lose respect for your partner. Once you lose respect you will never get it back.
 Laurie
4. Talk openly about everything, especially the stuff that hurts
We always talk about whats bothering us with each other, not anyone else! We have so many friends who are in marriages that are not working well and they tell me all about what is wrong. I cant help them, they need to be talking to their spouse about this, thats the only person who can help them figure it out. If you can figure out a way to be able to always talk with your spouse about whats bugging you then you can work on the issue.
 Ronnie 
5. A healthy relationship means two healthy individuals
Understand that it is up to you to make yourself happy, it is NOT the job of your spouse. I am not saying you shouldnt do nice things for each other, or that your partner cant make you happy sometimes. I am just saying dont lay expectations on your partner to make you happy. It is not their responsibility. Figure out as individuals what makes you happy as an individual, be happy yourself, then you each bring that to the relationship.
 Mandy
6. Give each other space
Be sure you have a life of your own, otherwise it is harder to have a life together. What do I mean Have your own interests, your own friends, your own support network, and your own hobbies. Overlap where you can, but not being identical should give you something to talk about and expose one another to. It helps to expand your horizons as a couple, but isnt so boring as both living the exact same life.
 Anonymous
7. You and your partner will grow and change in unexpected ways; embrace it
Over the course of 20 years we both have changed tremendously. We have changed faiths, political parties, numerous hair colors and styles, but we love each other and possibly even more. Our grown kids constantly tell their friends what hopeless romantics we are. And the biggest thing that keeps us strong is not giving a fuck about what anyone else says about our relationship.
 Dotti
8. Get good at fighting
The relationship is a living, breathing thing. Much like the body and muscles, it cannot get stronger without stress and challenge. You have to fight. You have to hash things out. Obstacles make the marriage.

Ewan beats stinking heat to grab Tour lead
Adelaide: Rising Australian sprinter Caleb Ewan defied a heatwave to claim the opening stage of the UCI season-opening Tour Down Under in the South Australian wine-growing town of Lyndoch on Tuesday.
Ewan, 22, surged in the last 200 metres to hold off Dutchman Danny van Poppell and Irelands Sam Bennett and win the 118-kilometre stage in three hours, 24 minutes and 18 seconds.
The Orica-Scott rider will wear the ochre leaders jersey into Wednesdays second stage over 148.5km from Stirling in the Adelaide Hills to the town of Paracombe.
Officials had earlier decided to shorten the stage from 145 kilometres as temperatures climbed above 40 Celsius during the race.
It was really stinking hot out there today, Ewan said.
I think everyone felt the heat. It was a good idea for the race to be shortened because we were just rolling around out there in the sun and it cant be too good for you.
Im just happy to get that win. It was a really close one in the end.
The race started in the inner-city Adelaide suburb of Unley with the temperature already reaching 39 Celsius.
Australian Adam Hansen tried to join him but couldnt cross the gap and the dangerous Bakelants, who won a stage of the 2013 Tour de France using the same tactic, looked like causing an upset. But the sprinters teams came to the front of the peloton and Bakelants was caught with only two kilometres to go.
World champion Peter Sagan led an attack to bring Bennett to the front but Ewan stayed close and with the finish line in sight, he sprinted up the inside to edge van Poppell and Bennett and repeat his opening stage win from 2016.
The young Australian may only wear the leaders jersey for one day however with Wednesdays stage to take place in the hills around Adelaide and four-time champion and Orica-Scott teammate Simon Gerrans only eight seconds behind in the overall standings. AFP

Federal Court upholds deportation of Tigers fundraiser who fought to stay in Canada for 22 years
An alleged fundraiser for the LTTE who has been fighting deportation from Canada for more than two decades has lost a key court battle after a federal judge dismissed his appeal.
The Federal Court upheld the deportation of Manickavasagam Suresh on the grounds he was a member of a terrorist organisation and that he was complicit in war crimes and crimes against humanity.
The evidence adequately supported the Immigration and Refugee Boards finding that Suresh was a member of the LTTE, Justice Richard Mosley wrote in his ruling.
The judge also found reasonable the IRBs finding that Suresh was a dedicated supporter who voluntarily worked on behalf of the LTTE and willingly followed the direction of the organisations leadership.
In 1990, Suresh was allegedly sent to Toronto by the LTTE to help run the groups front organisation, the World Tamil Movement, serving as its co-ordinator. But he was arrested in 1995 as a security risk.
Initially, Canadian authorities tried to deport him under a security certificate, which was upheld by the Federal Court. He fought the case to the Supreme Court, which ruled he could face torture if returned to his home country.
But the government continued to quietly push for his removal and in 2008, immigration officials drafted a report alleging he was inadmissible to Canada due to his membership in the WTM and his complicity in war crimes.
Following a hearing, the IRB ordered his deportation in 2015. The 40-page decision dismissing his appeal of that ruling was handed down on January 10 but as of Monday had not yet been posted on the Federal Court website.
The Tigers ran a lucrative fundraising operation in Toronto and Montreal until the WTMs offices were raided by the RCMP in 2006. Among other things, the searches turned up appeals for money to buy weapons.
The WTM was placed on Canadas list of outlawed terrorist groups in 2008. - National Post

Federation of National Organisations to represent war heroes at UNHRC summit
Members of the Jathika Sanvidana Ekamuthuwa (Federation of National Organisations) will represent Sri Lankan War Heroes at the UN Geneva Human Rights Summit in March, Dr. Sarath Weerasekara said.
He was speaking at a media conference at the National Library and Documentation Services Board yesterday. Weerasekara said the report by the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights, Prince Zeid Al-Hussein on Sri Lanka war crimes is a hoax.
He said if Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera appreciates Husseins report, it is highly unlikely the government will defend Sri Lankas war heroes at an international hearing. Speaking on the Manouri Muttettugama Report, Weerasekara alleged that it [the government] supports the needs of separatists.
This committee report was welcomed by the Tamil National Alliance and the Global Tamil Forum, which are the political pawns of the LTTE, he said.Weerasekara said with a government of their own all traitors working against the country will be brought before court.
What we had in Sri Lanka was a non-international armed conflict. For such a conflict, it is not International Human Rights but International Humanitarian Rights which is applied. So the UN is not qualified to accuse Sri Lanka of war crimes on that ground, Weerasekara said.
He said if any parties are involved in war crimes, they should be brought to justice within Sri Lanka and their offences should be presented before the local judiciary.
We are currently seeking registration to participate in this summit, which hopefully we will get. If we will not be able to register on time, we have another organisation via which we can participate in the summit, Weerasekara said.
Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka Thera, attorney-at-law Kalyananda Thiranagamage and Patriotic National Movement Secretary Dr. Wasantha Bandara also spoke at the media briefing.

Movenpick Hotel Colombo is Colombos first new international five star property in 25 years. It was inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena last week. It is a new chapter in the story of Colombo that announces the new face of Sri Lanka  its vibrancy and its potential.
This enticing and strikingly modern 24 floor property which officially opened its door on the 16th of this week, will see Swiss Management firm Movenpick Hotels & Resorts introduce a unique hospitality concept that promises boost the morale of the capital.
Set to be a spectacle of wonder, this sophisticated property is characterized by its modern architecture. The epitome of style, the diamond shaped exterior blends well with the organic hanging gardens, boasting some 14, 310 plants.
All 219 rooms and suites feature floor to ceiling windows and the rooftop bar boasts the best city and ocean views in town. The rooms divided into Junior Suites, Executive Suites and a presidential suite are all luxuriously furnished and offering access to the rooftop infinity pool and Jacuzzi.
Movenpick Hotel Colombo is an inspirational modern landmark that introduces exciting new hospitality concepts to the city and this signifies a new era of prosperity for an island nation reenergized and undergoing rapid development, said Chief Operating Officer Movenpick Hotels and Resorts, Middle East and South Asia, Andreas Mattmuller.
The property offers the largest executive lounge, dedicated business traveler reception, including five meeting rooms and a boardroom.
The hotel offers an astronomical gastronomic experience! With seven creative bar and restaurant concepts from which to choose. They include the brasserie, Colombos first in- hotel classic French restaurant, Robata Grill & Lounge serving Japanese cuisine and Sushi. All day dining venue AYU, Vistas Rooftop Bar & Lounge, the exclusive Mansion bar and night lounge, the chic Lobby Lounge and the Pool Bar where drinks and light meals can be enjoyed.
Guests can also enjoy a workout with a view at the fully equipped gym located 100 meters high or relax at the Spa Ceylon where signature treatments use natural oils and herbs.
We set out to build this hotel to appeal to market segments such as business minds, leisure travelers those coming in and out of Colombo on holiday, with the need to stay near the airport and also gambling enthusiasts from India and the Middle East. We want to be the lifeblood of the hotel experience delivery for business leisure travelers and local patrons. Our strategy was to find a hotel operator with an international reach and we found the ideal partner in Movenpick, said Softlogic CEO/Director Dr. Stephan L. Anthonisz
Movenpick Hotels & Resorts is an upscale hotel management company with over 16,000 staff members. It is represented in 23 countries, with 83 hotels, resorts and Nile cruisers currently in operation.
They operate over 80 hotel properties globally from the USA to China. It was amongst the first companies to operate hotels under management contracts in the early 1970s. The Movenpick hotel chain serves 7.5 million people per year, roughly the population of Switzerland. It has over 20,000 employees. It is the fastest growing international chain in the Middle East. It takes sustainability seriously, being a green globe strategic partner and I am told Movenpick hotel Colombo will get there in six months. Their brand mission talks about bringing leisure, indulgence and cultivating authenticity with a specific aim to make the ordinary something extraordinary, stated Anthonisz.
It shows attentiveness with charm. All of the aforesaid align perfectly with soft-logic credo of best in the business.
This signifies a new era in Colombos long history. It is a statement of positive optimism, post- civil war, with a contrast of modern architecture and natural hanging gardens. It also represents a vertical experience providing a touch of altitude and attitude to Colombos traditional hotel market. The project architect was our very own Murad Ismail. The guest rooms have the feeling of space with floor to ceiling glass, where one can view the culturally rich and colorful Colombo scape. The interiors are modern, cool, chic and sophisticated, pointed out Anthonisz.
The Hotel provides a whole new level in design, vistas, comfort, service and technology delivered by Movenpick, Swiss fashion with a Sri Lankan soul. The project is the result of tireless effort of Prof. Chitra Weddikara and many others.
The contractors did a splendid job in completing the structure of the building on time. The whole team performed well. A special thank you to the contractors too numerous to mention today. Also a special thank you to the many regulatory bodies that assisted us with negotiating the bureaucracy. We believe that the Movenpick hotel Colombo brand promise of natural enjoyment will be delivered in a way that is compelling and competitive, added Anthonisz.
Movenpick Hotel and Resorts President and CEO Olivier Chavy called Movenpick part of the new generation of Hotels.
I took the helm at Movenpick Hotels and Resorts in September 2016 as the Swiss Hotel management firms newly appointed CEO and I am pretty sure that this will set the tone for the new generation of hotels. For me grooming and training the younger generation is very important. For me educating the next generation is critical. It guarantees the success of the future. They will inherit this legacy. For me great values mean a lot. So this is an amazing project and this is an amazing country, said Chavy.
Chief Operating Officer Movenpick Hotels and Resorts Middle East and South Asia, Andreas Mattmuller spoke of how he had made his way up from the position of cook and waiter.
It is important to understand every aspect of the hospitality industry to be a successful leader. But learning how to build relationships and doing business with integrity across a wide range of different countries and cultures has really helped me progress in my role with Movenpick Hotels and Resorts, said Mattmuller. Speaking through experience, Mattmuller has really spelt out the formula for success in the hospitality trade.
I love to see progress, see results, see people grow, see the brand develop. But this is not a one man show. I trust the people I work with. And we are trusted by the business partners who share our vision. I am proud of that. Movenpick Hotels and Resorts is known for quality, reliability, care and personalized service. We have a commitment to consistently deliver memorable experiences to our guests every day. My job is to ensure it stays that way, stated Mattmuller.
Mattmuller called the entire operation an amazing journey.
We have opened many hotels and our relationship is just amazing because we share the same vision. What we want to do is to build a hotel to make a statement that is fresh and new to the destination. And we have finally realized our dream. We are delighted to be here in this wonderful country and this country has amazing potential. We are very confident of the future of Sri Lanka and we are excited to be a part of it, added Mattmuller.

The gazetting of new wards will be done by January 31, Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Mustapha said as he finally accepted the report on delimitation yesterday. Elections however may not be held any time soon.
The last time they submitted the report they only had the signatures of three of the five committee members. Hence, I refused to accept it and when I sort advice from the Attorney General on the subject, he said it was better to have the signatures of all five and for those who object, to give it in writing,explained the minister addressing a media briefing at the Ministry along with Chairman of the Delimitation Committee, Asoka Peiris.
The final member to sign, UNP member A.S.M. Misbah had signed the report last morning along with a footnote.
The footnote does not impact the report greatly. He simply states that there were those who brought other concerns before the committee which did not come within our mandate. For example, requests such as to turn an urban council into a municipal one, Peiris said.
Peiris has also requested time until the end of the month to finish off the final administrative work on the report, We need to correct any type errors in the report and then we can gazette it, Mustapha said.
The Elections Commissioner in the meantime has informed the government that around 54 areas in the Local Government Elections Act would need to be amended before an election is held. Amendments thereafter would have to go through the Legal Draftsman, Cabinet and then garner Parliamentary approval in order to come into effect.
Minister Mustapha insisted that the ministry would do the needful to bring in the amendments to the Act as soon as possible.
Once the wards are gazetted however, the Elections Commission by law has a minimum of 55-72 days to hold an election and thus as stated by the Commissioner himself, elections are not to be expected before May.
The minister in the meantime was confident that all progressive parties would support the amendments and added, The Prime Minister has promised all minor parties that the government
would not allow for any injustice in the delimitation process and that all concerns would be addressed. But, he has insisted that we would stick with the mixed system as that was the mandate the government received by the people when elected to power.

THE GENTLE CAPULET
Shakespeare wrote on women differently. No two characters were similar. They were homicidal, suicidal, ambitious, murderous, cunning, gentle, idiotic, scholarly, etc. except for few like Ophelia and Juliet who were the epitome of innocence. Trusting and gullible; they made up the difference.
Let us take a look at JULIET,
Juliet has been reared by her faithful Nurse and reciprocate with trust, love and faith. We do not come across of any motherly love from Lady Capulet. Shakespeare reveals her as a beautiful teenager trapped in her mansion and its orchard and unexposed to suitors.
The character of Juliet has been portrayed in different ways in performing and visual arts. Historians and Shakespeare literati found her only as an embodiment of unspoiat youth. Some film directors made her look older than her thirteen years while many painters found it difficult to put a face of thirteen on canvas. Many historians thought a girl as young as she was, could not impart such dialogue. In the ballet of Romeo and Juliet, Margot Fonteyn was fifty six when she danced Juliet while Rudolf Nureyev who was thirty six. But in all fairness to Fonteyn, she looked sweetly innocent and bubbly like the thirteen year old Capulet Shakespeare raved about.
Nurse - shes not fourteen. How long is it now to Lammas - tide.
Lady Capulet - A fortnight and odd days.
Nurse - Even or add, of all days in the year: Lammas eve at night, she shall be fourteen.
A play in what Bernard Shaw said unassailable for once, tagged it an irresistibly impetuous march of music through the two hours of traffic on our stage, cannot be taken literally. This was a phrase from the Prologue. He sensed it as a tragedy of youth and a tale of star - crossed lovers he was vague about his homage to Juliet or for that matter, even the teen aged Romeo. Clearly, Shaw was disappointed.
In all her innocence, Juliet agrees to marry Paris and her mother, Lady Capulet assures she would behold him at the ball that night.
But tragedy strikes. It is Romeo she meets at the ball and falls in love. The play moves dramatically with Juliet as the central figure. Every move she makes and every word she utters, revolves tragically around the chief characters. When Romeo leaves the ball. she moves on to the balcony in expectation:
Romeo - O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright
It seems she hang upon the cheek of night.
As a rich jewel in an Ethiops ear beauty too rich for use, for Earths too dear
so shows a snowy dove trooping with crows  ACT. 1 scene V.
After the ball, Juliet forgets her promise to her parents. She is obsessed with the young Montague and throws caution to the winds;
Juliet - O Romeo, Romeo ; Wherefore art thou Romeo
Deny they father and refuse thy name Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love
And I ll be no longer a Capulet. ...... ACT. II Scene II
Juliet, who until now, never chose to do anything on her own, turns stub born. Desperation grips her as she becomes reckless. After her secret marriage vows to Romeo, she defies her father and refuse to marry Paris. With the help of her ever - faithful nurse, Juliet plans to free herself from the situation. She begs her father,
The Lammas Day has arrived.
Juliet - Good father, I beseech you on my knees
Hear me with patience but to speak a word
Lord Capulet - Hang thee, young baggage : disobedient wretch
I tell thee what, get thee to church on Thursday
Or never after look me in the face .. Act. III Scene V.
Soon after her faked death, she must come from the right latitude; no hint of northern skies and she needs far more childs experience experiments with very young actresses who have failed. The balcony scene remains poignant prelude to tragedy. She appears on it many times;
Juliet - Tis almost morning. Iwould have thee gone
And yet no further than a wantons bird
That lets it hop a little from her hand. ..... ACT. II Scene. III
And so the tragedy rolls on with Juliet set to sacrifice her life for Romeo. The play was written in 1595 6 and set in Verona, Mantua with the Houses of Capulets and Montagues as bitter rivals. The tragedy see them united over their children bodies.
The play has been acted so often but it had much ado to find itself. Romeo and Juliet still remain the most acted play to date with its ups and down. The sequence of revivals continue down the centuries. In the 1748 version David Garrick made an obligatory farewell dialogue that was enormously successful and gave the impetus for other to take the cue. Garrick acted Romeo for fifteen years from 1750. Juliet was the star character in the play as actresses competed with each other to outshine. Eliza O Neli in 1814 while Fanny Kemble was nineteen when she played Juliet in 1829 Helen Faucit in 1836 mesmerised the audience with her spectacular dialogue . They were and others were his toric Juliets. For fifteen years. Adelaid Neilson acted Juliet in England and the united States from 1865.
Jean Forbs - Robertson was a tantalizing Juliet at the Old Vic in 1828 while seven years later, an exciting, beautiful Juliet saw the light through magically right peggy Ashcroft opposite Sir Laurence Olivier. Little later, once again Adelaide Neilson and Mary Anderson were the American Juliets in the nineteeth century. On their footsteps, Julia Marlowe was brilliantly ardent as the young Capulet. In Black / White films, Olivia de Havillind and Norma Shearer gave life to Juliet.
In 1968 a fresh young fifteen yearold, Olivia Hussey played Juliet opposite sixteen year old Lenard Whitney and the film was readily received for its contempory handing.
There were operas and musical compositions apart from the stage and the innocence remained in her nature was the glowing tribute by the Bard to all young , beautiful and innocent women even of today that is a rare commodity.

George H.W. Bush hospitalized

DEVELOPING STORY
Former president George H.W. Bush has been hospitalized, according to the Houston Chronicle and Houston TV station KHOU.
Bush's chief of staff, Jean Becker, says he was admitted to Houston Methodist Hospital after falling ill.
Becker tells the Houston Chronicle and KHOU that Bush is "doing fine."
Bush, who served a single-term as President from 1988 to 1992, was not expected to attend the inauguration of the 45th President, Donald J. Trump, in Washington on Friday due to health concerns.
Several bouts with illness have kept the 92-year-old out of the spotlight in recent years and he has rarely made public remarks.
CNN is working to independently confirm the former President's status.
Previous health concerns
Bush revealed several years ago that he suffered from a form of Parkinson's disease that left him unable to walk. He used a wheelchair or a scooter to get around and had two other health scares in 2014 and 2015.
In December 2014 he was hospitalized for what aides described as a precautionary measure after experiencing shortness of breath, and the following July fell at his home in Kennebunkport, Maine, breaking the C2 vertebrae in his neck.
The injury did not result in any neurological problems, his spokesman said at the time.

The Givantha Arthasad story: The childhood years
In 1979, a man called Premaranjith Tilakaratne went to Anusha Theatre in Maharagama to watch a film. That feature film, the first by its director, was an animated and novel retelling of the story of Dutugemunu. Given that cartoons werent in the vogue then, a great many people had naturally shown interest in it, and had thronged halls and theatres by the dozen to watch it for themselves.
By the time Premaranjith had gone to Maharagama, however, Dutugemunu had been banned. Recalling this to me many, many decades later, he had only one comment to offer: They (the authorities) banned it for stupid, misconceived, and unjustifiable reasons. Before we come to what those reasons were, though, we should examine the story and history of the man behind the cartoon.
Giva in 1979.
Most of us acquired a love for stories as children. Stories, however, of a different order, certainly superior to what they have become now. In the process we also acquired a love for animation, the moving image, and in our first few attempts at understanding the cinema, we grew up loving Donald Duck, Mickey Mouse, and everything else that Walt Disney and (for later generations) the likes of Don Bluth and Miyazaki conjured up for us. Sri Lanka, strange as it may seem, was no stranger to such visionaries. The only thing they lacked, however, was the necessary willpower to move ahead. In this respect, one name stands apart from the rest. Givantha Arthasad.
Givantha Arthasad came to us in the late sixties. He gave us a cartoon industry that, though in shambles today, we no doubt are thankful for. He projected an image of himself which, I believe fervently, survives his work to date. Sporting a long, sagacious beard that at once taps into his formidable and creative sensibilities, he appears (as he pretty much is) larger than life. Ever since he began his career, he has specialised in eight different aesthetic fields, an unparalleled achievement on its own count. Before I move on to all that, however, I will go through his story.
He was born to a religiously devout mother and father. From an early age, he was exposed to the arts, something he clearly seems to have inherited from his family. His father, who taught and became headmaster and later principal at Methodist College in Katunayake (which Givantha briefly attended), used to bring students to their house and teach them scouting.
His mother, a teacher, did the same to teach them the arts, or more specifically handwork. All this, of course, was before the tuition culture invaded our schools, he remembers, My mother taught village children how to make toys, how to sculpt, and how to decorate walls, for free. That inevitably spilt over to him.
And it wasnt just scouting and handwork: his father would get him to read newspapers at the age of four, going so far as to teach him to read them upside down at the age of five. Recalling this for me, he says with a chortle, My father was always teaching unusual but useful things to his students. Naturally, he took the trouble of teaching them to me. Apart from reading, his father got him to read aloud. I learnt about dramatised reading, which is really nothing more than reading into the emotions and the nuances of a particular passage. To this end, he made me listen to the radio and in particular, to the news read by the likes of Cyril Rajapakse and Karunaratne Abeysekera.
As I mentioned before, he attended Methodist College Katunayake, though only for one year. He then entered Second Grade at Wesley College in 1960, to be taught by none other than the formidable yet soft-spoken thespian-to-be, Cyril Wickramage. Like many of his teachers (and associates), Cyril figures significantly in Givanthas memory. I was 20 years younger than him.
He used to comment on his students and their abilities. Now I was a stickler for drawing from an early age. By the time I got to Wesley, I could draw rather well for my age. One day, when Wickramage saw me drawing, he observed what I drew. He then commented rather cryptically, You shouldnt have been born here. I didnt know what he meant at the time, but in later years, I did.
After he entered Grade Three, he moved into the College hostel. His class teacher, Miss Ivy Marasinghe (Professor Walter Marasinghes aunt), was as receptive to young Givanthas abilities as Cyril had been. In addition to being receptive, she was also a good artiste herself. After lunch and after school, she conducted some art classes where we helped her draw and craft. We were given an opportunity to watch 16mm cartoon films during the weekend, standard fare like Mickey Mouse and Donald Duck.
Needless to say, the artiste in Givantha was aroused, if not enthralled, by these (cartoons were unheard of in Sri Lanka, except for one or two films which had animated opening credits). They compelled him to ask her about the art of cartoon films.
What happened next Miss Marasinghe did something very few teachers would do today. She told me to wait, referred up some books at the British Council, returned, and patiently explained to me about the nuts, bolts, and other niceties of cartoon films.
I ask him as to whether his interest in the subject developed from that point, and he agrees: I was always moved by the moving image. In fact, he adds, it would be safe to say that his aspirations for the media (which he excelled at, though that chapter of his life is yet to come here) were rooted then and there with Miss Marasinghe. Not surprisingly, he says he owes much of his interest in his field to her enthusiasm.
For someone who ended up retelling the Dutugemunu story through cartoon strips, Givantha surprisingly opted for Science at school. Unlike today (when subjects are cordoned off from each other and barriers have been erected to make students specialise), however, there was a clear, if not subtle, connection between science and his love for the arts.
As we moved up in school, we graduated from geometry to mechanical drawing to physics. We didnt abandon our love for the arts. Still, I personally felt that I ought to have opted more for the latter. This latter sentiment, coincidentally, was shared by the Principal at Wesley College. Givantha explains how.
We used to submit our drawings to various exhibitions around the country. For that, we needed the signature from the Principal, certifying that what was submitted was by us and from Wesley College. I think I must have visited the man several times, as I submitted a great many such drawings, because during one such visit, he told me point-blank, Givantha putha, meka hari yanne naha, oya art karoth eeta vada hondayi. He then directed a Prefect to bring to his office the teacher in charge of the Arts section, Jayantha Premachandra.

Govt. turning into military regime: Amarasekara
The government is turning into a fascist military regime. It manoeuvres the Inspector General of Police and the Attorney General by mis-employing them for its own advantage, Jathika Sanvidana Ekamuthuwa Convener, Gunadasa Amarasekara said.
He said so speaking on the arrest of former Minister Wimal Weerawansa. Amarasekara said that it was a fruitless attempt by the government to silence a leading figure against the new federal Constitution.
If we are to take former President Chandrika Bandaranaikes remarks on hate-speech into consideration, the government may arrest us as well, Amarasekara pointed out.
Amarasekara also condemned Ven. Athuraeliye Rathana Theras decision to stay independent and attempt to correct the Yahapalana government on certain decisions. Rathana theros attempt is to weaken the nationalistic movement against the government by producing a movement of their own, Amarasekara said.
Ven. Rathana thera is also behind a master plan to bring Patali Champika Ranawaka into power, Amarasekara alleged.
He also said that the UNP and the SLFP in the joint government are like two thieves who act as enemies by day and go around stealing by night.
The government is not interested in abolishing the executive presidency, changing the electoral system or solving ethnic issue, he further said.
Attorney-at-Law, Kalyananda Thiranagamage said the government is meddling with the judiciary of the country.
The cases filed by the FCID are not legal. Implementing national policies for the right or wrong, cannot be considered a crime, it can only be an irregularity. It is the responsibility of the Auditor General to look into irregularities connected with national policy implementations, Thiranagamage said.
Every individual has the freedom of expression. So how does a court issue an order prohibiting demonstrations for 14 days Thiranagamage questioned. Speaking on regaining the GSP+ facility, Dr. Wasantha Bandara said it is but a trap to fall prey.

Health Minister solicits help from heads of institutions to control dengue
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed all Cabinet Ministers, Chief Ministers of all Provinces and State Ministers in connection with obtaining their support towards the control of the increasing dengue threat in State institutions, Health Ministry sources said.
According to the sources, Minister Dr. Senaratne had made a written request from the Ministers to implement an inspection programme to detect dengue mosquito breeding sites in their respective institutions on January 24. Dengue mosquito breeding sites located in State institutions have increased alarmingly.
Once respective State institutions ascertain their own dengue mosquito breeding grounds and destroy them on January 24, health authorities attached to the MOH Offices in their relevant areas would inspect the State institutions on January 25, 26 and 27, the sources said.
According to the latest findings of the Health Ministry, 65 percent of all state institutions in the country, 70 percent of all religious institutions, 60 percent of all schools and 58 percent of all construction sites harbour dengue mosquito breeding sites.
A total of 1,311 dengue patients have been reported during the past 17 days of this year. A total of 54,727 dengue patients and 78 deaths were reported last year, the sources added.

How to Cultivate a Year of Mindfulness
In 2016, I practiced mindfulness more than I ever have before, after 10 years of sporadic practice.
I meditated regularly, practiced with a local Zen group, did a great one-day sitting, went on a retreat, took courses, read books, practiced mindful eating and exercise, learned some great new practices, and taught several mindfulness courses.
I learned a lot about how to cultivate a more mindful life, and Id like to encourage you to try it this year.
Why A few good reasons: You learn to be awake to the present moment more, and lost in the daydream of your thoughts less.You begin to see your mental patterns that affect everything you do, and thus begin to free yourself of those patterns.You learn to be frustrated less, and let go more. And smile more.You learn to be better at compassion, equanimity, love, contentment.You learn to be better at not procrastinating, and better at building better habits.
I could go on about better mental and physical health, better relationships, less fear  but the reasons Ive given are strong enough. Its important stuff.
So how do we cultivate a year of mindfulness Im glad you asked.
Im just going to dive in and share my favorite tips for creating a year of mindfulness:
Commit to sitting daily for a month. 
It would be great to commit to a year of sitting meditation practice, but I think thats too long for the brain to commit to. So I recommend trying to sit everyday for a month. Tell people about it, set reminders on your phone and calendar, put a note somewhere you wont miss it, and keep the meditation short  just 2-5 minutes to start with, until you become more regular. This is the foundational practice for being more mindful, so make a big commitment to sitting.
Find a group.
If you can find a meditation group in your area to sit with once a week, thats ideal. It doesnt matter much what kind of group it is (Zen, Tibetan, Vipassana, etc.), just meet with them and meditate however you like when youre on the cushion. If you cant find a group in your area, find a group that meets online (San Francisco Zen Center has an online practice group, for example). This commitment to a group deepens the practice.
Practice mindful eating.
Im gonna be honest here, I dont practice this as much as I should. But its a good example of how you can take something you already do every day, and use it as a meditation. Simply commit to doing nothing but eating  single-task instead of multitasking. As you eat each bite, pay attention to the food, the textures and flavors and colors.
Notice when your mind wanders. Savor the food. Showering, brushing your teeth, washing your dishes, walking and sweeping are other good activities to use as meditation.
Take a course.
This is a bit self-promotional, but Im offering mindfulness courses in my Sea Change Program. However, you can take any online or in-person course, free or paid  I find that they force you to practice and reflect on your practice, so that your learning deepens even further.
Find a teacher or partner.
I am lucky to have a teacher who I meet with every couple months  I find that just knowing that Im going to be talking to her means that Ill try harder to learn, remind myself a bit more, reflect on my learning more so that I have something to talk to her about. If you cant find a teacher, a learning partner can function the same way.
Watch your frustration.
When you get irritated, frustrated or angry  let it be a mindfulness bell! It is a great opportunity to drop out of your story, and notice how your body is feeling. What got you hooked What story are you telling yourself What is your mental pattern when you get hooked What is the physical feeling in your body at this moment Practice as much as you can!
Read a good mindfulness book.
You learn mindfulness by practicing, but a good book can guide your practice. I recommend checking out my recently published Zen Habits Beginners Guide to Mindfulness, and I also like Mindfulness in Plain English.
Practice yoga or mindful movement. Yoga is moving meditation, and I highly recommend it. If you arent drawn to yoga, try walking or running or doing other exercise while trying to pay mindful attention to your body and breath. Either way, see it as an opportunity to meditate as you move.
Sit with procrastination & fear. Whenever you start to procrastinate or run to distraction, there is fear at the root of your urge. Instead of running, sit with it. Notice the fear or resistance. Stay with this feeling, become intimate with it, be friendly towards it, smile at it. Stay, stay, until it dissolves. Zen Habits
