Kuznetsova  chasing Konta  for last WTA Finals place

Johanna Konta can only be overtaken by Svetlana Kuznetsova in the race to qualify for the WTA Finals, after Carla Suarez Navarros hopes ended in Moscow.
Suarez Navarro could have passed Konta by winning the Kremlin Cup but retired with a wrist injury in round two.
Konta is in line to take the eighth and final place at the season-ending event, but the Briton is not competing this week as she recovers from injury. Kuznetsova, who needs to win the Kremlin Cup, beat Alize Cornet 6-4 7-5. The Russian, who is the defending champion, will play Hungarys Timea Babos in the quarter-finals on Thursday.
I try not to think about it, said Kuznetsova. Its a tough goal - I have to win the Kremlin Cup, meaning its a long way to go. I will do my best.
Konta, 25, is eighth in the Singapore standings following the withdrawal of world number two Serena Williams, but it is not clear whether the Briton would be fit to play should she qualify. BBC

Bangladesh debutant teenager puts England in a spin
Chittagong: Teenage debutant Mehedi Hasan claimed five wickets for 64 runs to stun Englands top order and give Bangladesh the upper hand in the first Test in Chittagong on Thursday.
Moeen Ali and Jonny Bairstow scored half-centuries each as England reached 258-7 at stumps on the first day, after skipper Alastair Cook elected to bat first at the Zahur Ahmed Chowdhury stadium.
Moeen survived five reviews on his way to smashing 68 runs and Bairstow made 52 as England steadied against some superb bowling from Bangladeshs spinners to post a respectable score.
Chris Woakes was 36 not out and Adil Rashid unbeaten on five.
Experienced left-arm spinner Shakib Al Hasan finished the day with 2-46 to complement 18-year-old Mehedi, who became the seventh Bangladeshi bowler to take five wickets in his Test debut.
I never expected such a debut of this kind, Mehedi said. I thought that I would pick up two wickets and score 30 runs but what happened is something I will remember all my life.
Mehedi, named player of the tournament at the Under-19 World Cup earlier this year, made an immediate impression, bowling Ben Duckett for 14 before trapping Gary Ballance for one in his opening spell.
Shakib removed Cook for just four, in a disappointing start for the skipper who became Englands most capped player with 134 Tests.
Mehedi opened the attack for the hosts, beating Duckett on several occasions before he spun one beautifully to hit the middle stump as soon as the England debutant offered some room. Three balls later Cook was also gone, attempting a sweep shot off Shakib only for the ball to hit him on the forearm and then the body before smashing onto the stumps. AFP

Ekanayake takes over as CEO of SLRFU on Nov 1

Four times Asian rugby championship captain Priyantha Ekanayake with his tremendous experience as a player and administrator is making a return to the rugby scrum, not to actively participate but to help in the promotion of the game as the CEO of the SLRFU. He will return to the administrative from November 1.
The former St. Anthonys College, Kandy SC, CH & FC, CR & FC, Colombo Clubs, Upcountry and Sri Lanka forward who also played for the Asian Barbarians and led all the teams he played except CH and FC.
Priyantha was one time Kandy SC committee member and Vice President. He comes in with a wealth of experience. He can be rated as the best ruggerite produced by St. Anthonys College, and is the first Antonian to lead Sri Lanka at rugby. He has the unique achievement of being the only ruggerite to lead the country at four Asian rugby championships.
Though he ended up at St. Anthonys College, he first went to Rikilagaskanda Central, in the shadows of Dumbara Valley.
He was an outstanding third row forward during his days. He had an excellent record in school with his natural talent. Towering over six feet, Priyantha played rugger, cricket, and basketball and also took part in athletics for the Antonians from 1973 to 1985.
His pet sport was basketball at school, and he represented the country at the 7th Asian Basketball Championship in Seoul, Korea where he also obtained a Korean Diploma in Basketball Coaching.
Later he represented the country at several tournaments. At cricket he was a fine all-rounder,where he shaped up as a good pace bowler but rugby robbed him from cricket. He started his rugby career under the guidance of the famous Antonian coach late Kalu Perera, who coached him till he left school. While still at school he played for Kandy SC.
There was no stopping Priyantha who represented the Sri Lanka Under 25 team and toured Taipei in 1985. From about this time he was an automatic choice for the national team. After seeing his talent, in the very same year CH & FCs kingpin at the time, Kishin Butani invited him to play for the Maitland Crescent Club and he played in the R. Premadasa Trophy Championship which CH & FC went on to
win. After a short stint at CH & FC he crossed over to CR & FC in 1987 on the invitation of Malik Samarawickrema and played for them till 1991 captaining the side in 1990.
In 1992 Priyantha and a set of players from CR & FC, most of them products of Kandy schools, came over to Kandy, and helped the club to win their first ever trophy in rugby after 42 years.
It was Priyantha, who motivated the Nittawela boys to do great things. From the year 1985 to 1997 Priyantha was a regular member of the Sri Lanka team and had the privilege of leading the country at four Asiads, a record.
Priyantha also had a stint in New Zealand where he played for Ravense Bourne Sports Club in the Premier League. He also played in Wales for Ebbebale Province.
In 1997 he made Kandy and the country proud by leading the Asian Barbarians invitation team. The Barbarians comprised players from Thailand, Singapore, Malaysia and Sri Lanka. The other players who were selected were Thushara Jayalath of Havelocks SC and Asoka Jayasena of Kandy SC, but Asoka skipped the game due to the Kandy SC Cup final. In the main game, they met the Hong Kong Dragons where again the Barbarians won by 26 points to nil.
Priyantha coached the Kandy SC when Haris Omar led the team, and helped the club to win the inter club sevens for the first time in 1999. In the last couple of years he was involved with St. Anthonys College rugby. So, with his experience, he is sure to excel in administration as well.

Sugathadasa Stadium to be  fully restored by next February: Sports Ministry to take legal action against local company

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that the Sugathadasa Stadium will be fully restored into a modern sports complex by next February.
The Sports Minister making an inspection tour of the stadium said that a new artificial running track, ground renovation and a new lighting system will be implemented very soon.
Speaking further the Minister stated that a fully equipped sports facility is a long felt necessity among sports personnel. He also revealed that the ministry will take legal action against the local company which carried out the previous ground construction and artificial track implementation, spending millions of rupees. The need of a new rain water drainage system for the Sugathadasa Stadium was also discussed.
The stadium will be ready to host rugby and soccer matches before December 31 with the completion of renovation work and the tender for laying the new artificial running track will be given to a reputed company on December 20. In the meantime the lighting system tender will also be worked out.
The light posts around the ground were built around 25 years ago and has been recommended to be removed. The Finance Ministry has approved Rs. 660 million for renovation of Sugathadasa Stadium and Hotel, but the total cost is expected to exceed that limit.
All construction at the stadium is being carried out under the supervision of a special Army unit headed by Captain Premathilaka who has been trained in America on the subject. This special unit played a key role in the renovation of the Racecourse grounds.
It took more than four months to obtain implementation and technical committee reports. We had to be very careful in tender procedures as there was a huge flouting during the previous tender. The constructor will have two months from December 20 to complete the task. The Sugathadasa Hotel is on the verge of completing its renovation. The administration building is still under construction. All these developments are taking place after 15 years, the Sports Minister said.
The Sugathadasa Stadium was fully renovated prior to the 2013 Asian Junior Athletic Championship in June. A new artificial track was laid at a cost of Rs. 113 million and another Rs. 32 million was spent on ground renovations. But within a few months an emergency maintenance repair forced the close down of sports activities at the Sugathadasa stadium.
A four-member committee was appointed by the Sports Ministry to investigate into the construction at the stadium and they have submitted their report within three weeks. The committee comprised Rear Admiral Shemal Fernando - chairman (secretary, Sri Lanka Athletic Association), Dervin Perera (national coach), Susanthika Jayasinghe (vice president - Sri Lanka Athletic Association) and Sajith Jayalal (Deputy Director General - Sports).
The report has indicated that the artificial running track is in a very dilapidated condition and cannot be used for running while the practice track is also unusable. Under these circumstances the Sports Ministry acted promptly to stop payment of Rs. 30 million to the relevant local construction company, the Minister stated.
