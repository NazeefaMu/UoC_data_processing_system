Dengue kills over 50, ails 41,301 by November
Epidemiology Unit sources said 41,301 dengue cases and around 50 deaths were recorded in the country by November 2.
The highest number of dengue cases (7,951) was reported from the Colombo district while the Gampaha district recorded the second highest (4,478).
The Batticaloa district has reported the third highest (4,379).
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) recorded 1998 dengue cases. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,953 dengue cases. The Western Province reported 14,957 cases, epidemiologists said.
The public is advised to seek treatment without delay for any type of fever and not to apply domestic remedies. Fever patients must rest and should not work.
They should take only Paracetamol. Other medications, especially Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen can cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF), doctors warn.
People should clean their land and houses to arrest the situation. Water in a pen clip or a bottle top is enough for dengue mosquitoes to breed.

Majority of Lankans endorse regime change
Kelaniya University Prof. Ven. Nabiriththankadawala Gnanarathana Thera said that majority of Sri Lankans had endorsed the decision taken by President Maithripala Sirisena for a regime change.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo, yesterday, Ven. Gnanarathana Thera said it was the same kind of change that people expected in 2015. We endorse this change with the blessings of the bhikkhu community led by the Maha Sanga, he said.
That was why people volunteered to help the move by reducing three-wheeler fares and prices of bakery items. The stock market had also shown significant improvement and only the international community had rejected the change, the thera added.
People said that President Sirisena had played a neutral role, allowing the United National Party (UNP) to govern the country as it wished for the past three-and-a-half years; but the President was under severe pressure and did not act to betray the UNP, even though UNPers were involved in campaigns against him, Ven. Gnanarathana Thera said.
People were fed up with the deteriorating national prestige, hunting down of war heroes, destruction of archaeological artifacts, and sidelining of the Maha Sangha during the previous regime. All these reasons resulted in him taking the a wise decision to save the country and its people, he added.
Just like all political parties and other factions which came forward to support Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to end the war when he was President in 2009, everyone should rally round the government to resolve the issues related to the economic recession and foreign influences, he said.
The thera added that the Yahapalana government, which came into power promising the elimination of fraud and corruption, ended up engaging in malpractices itself.
Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya Registrar Ven. Dr. Pallekande Rathnasara Thera said that the publics confidence in the Yahapalana government had broken down. The country marched towards Western colonialism by neglecting the values of the nation.
We were shocked when archaeological artifacts were destroyed and war heroes were taken into custody. The President was viewing this situation for a long time with patience and took a brave decision at the right time, he said.
Matara Weherahen Temple Chief Incumbent Ven. Kegalle Ratanasara Thera said people were under pressure due to the escalating prices of essential commodities, the drug menace, as well as the crime wave that had been prevalent for the past three years.
He added that although the public initially had hope in the UNP administration, at the end of three-and-a-half years, they had become desperate. For a long time the President waited for the UNP administration to chose the right path, but he recently understood that it would never happen.
Shanthi Foundation Anushasaka Ven. Kotapola Amarakiththi Thera said the Portuguese and the English wanted to subject the country to colonialism, adding that the former Prime Minister attempted to repeat history.
The Buddha had said that a leader should review situations and act cautiously. The public came to understand that the regime should be changed and that is why the President took the decision in due course, Ven. Hegoda Vipassi Thera said.

All actions against war heroes must end - Gotabhaya
The new government has a short term of office and since the government needs to be strengthened, it has to go before the people soon, Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking to the media when he attended Siyapath Vandana, the Ranaviru Ashirvada pooja to involve blessings on the Tri Forces, police and civil security personnel who had laid down their lives during the 30-year war, at the Ruwanweli Seya, Anuradhapura, on Saturday.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa said all steps taken against war heroes by the former government should be condemned and ended. The new government will wipe out all misdeeds taken against war heroes.
He said the TNA had been divided into two camps today. A section of Parliamentarians who love the Tamil people are expected to support Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The US Foreign Secretary had stated that they spent US$ 400 million to overthrow the government in 2015. This showed how MPs were bought over then. The payments were through Singaporean banks. No country had come forward like that to offer money and buy over MPs in the new government.
He said the President is vested with powers under the Constitution to prorogue Parliament or dissolve it to ensure stability in the country. Each and every President had used this power in the history of this country. A President who belonged to the UNP had once prorogued Parliament for two months.
Rajapaksa said he personally felt that to establish a strong government they should go before the people.
The Siyapath Vandana Ashirvadapooja was jointly organised by the Hela Ranaviru Bala Muluwa, Pahan Maga, Jagath Deshapremi Lankeeya Sansadaya, Ranaviru Sahayogitha Ekamuthuwa, Hari Maga and Manusha Padanama organisations.
Earlier, Gotabhaya Rajapaksa called on Ruwanweli Viharadhipathi Ven. Pallegama Hamaratana Nayaka Thera and received his blessings.
Thereafter the participants led by Gotabhaya Rajapaksa arrived at the Ruwanweli Seya in a colourful procession led by the Maha Sangha and participated in a Malpahan Gilanpasa and Atapirikara pooja.
The religious observances were held under the patronage of Atamasthanadhipati Ven. Pallegama Siriniwasa Nayaka Thera and Ven. Pallegama Hamaratana Thera. Jayanthi Viharadhipati Ven. Nugetenne Pannananda Thera, Ven. Ethalawetune Wewa Gnanaloka Thera, Maj. Gen. Kamal Gunaratne, former Northern Province G.S. Chandrasiri, former Chief Minister S.M. Ranjith Samarakoon and H.B.

Lankans should decide on PM  Indian Foreign Secretary
Days after former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was sworn in as the Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, India a strong ally of Sri Lanka in its first official statement said they are willing to work with any Prime Minister in the best interest of both countries.
In response to queries regarding the recent developments in Sri Lanka, the official spokesperson Raveesh Kumar said that India is closely following the recent political developments in Sri Lanka. As a democracy and a close friendly neighbour, we hope that democratic values and the constitutional process will be respected. We will continue to extend our developmental assistance to the friendly people of Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Vijay Gokhale who met with journalists at the South Block in New Delhi said that India was not promoting any particular person and that it was for the people of Sri Lanka to decide on whether the Prime Minister would be former President Mahinda Rajapaksa or Ranil Wickremesinghe.
During this meeting he had also rejected allegations that India was tampering with the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
However, Janata Party Leader Dr. Subramanian Swamy who was instrumental in arranging for the Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to meet with Indian Premier Narendra Modi and other officials said that he would work hard to ensure friendship and cooperation between India and Sri Lanka. He added that President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa as well as Prime Minister Narendra Modi were peoples leaders and they understood the pulse of the people.
Indian officials who are in talks with Sri Lanka over proposed and ongoing Indian projects said that the current political situation has no bearing on the trade relations. Officials told the sister publication Sunday Observer that talks on upgrading the Free Trade Agreement into the Proposed Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement and the Cooperation on Infrastructure Development Projects was processing well and are about to be concluded satisfactorily.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi during a meeting with Ranil Wickremesinghe in October this year, had expressed concerns at the slow progress of the Indian funded projects in the country. According to a press release issued by the Indian ministry of external affairs, the main item on the agenda was a review of the progress in Indian projects.
Unlike the MEA press release, a statement from the former Sri Lankan Prime Ministers Office indicated that Modi had expressed dissatisfaction with the slow pace of implementation of Indian projects in Sri Lanka.

No external pressure  Foreign Minister
The international community has not exerted any pressure on the country as portrayed by the UNP, Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said.
The European Union has only requested the Government to resolve the current problem in the country democratically and that cannot be taken as exerting any pressure, he said, when he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their respective Viharayas in Kandy and received their blessings on November 4 morning.
Dr. Amunugama said he was capable of taking forward the Governments foreign policy by gaining the confidence of the international Community.
He said when there was a crisis between the Executive and the Legislature, it should be resolved through Courts through an interpretation of the constitutions. The UNP was not going to courts because it knows that the President had acted in accordance with the constitution. According to powers vested in the President, he could prorogue Parliament for two months. This was done by President Premadasa when he was in power.
Although the international community could not exert pressure when action had been taken according to the Constitution, the government had given thought to the possibility of unfavourable repercussions if this situation led to violence and bloodshed. This was because the media was so powerful today that even a minor incident could be taken to the world in a matter of seconds, the Minister said.
He said the President had already summoned foreign diplomats and briefed them on the true situation in the country and he too had briefed diplomats of SAARC countries. He said Arjuna Ranatungas irresponsible entry into the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation premises had ignited a clash resulting in an unfortunate death due to shooting.
This was portrayed internationally as a death due to the political crisis which was a complete travesty of the truth.
He said Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa had no problem in showing a majority in Parliament and anyone who wanted to secure the post should show a majority in Parliament.

It is important for all parties including the UNP to oppose any such move to impose sanctions, the Asgiriya Prelate said.
The Asgiriya Prelate made this observation when UNP Parliamentarians Lakshman Kiriella, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Ravi Karunanayake and J.C. Alawatuwala called on him at his temple in Kandy and received his blessings yesterday.
The Prelate said the Maha Sangha expected the present crisis to be resolved through discussions and negotiations because foreign countries would unnecessarily intervene if there was bloodshed in the country.
Lekakadhikari of the Asgiriya chapter Ven. Medagama Dhammananda Thera said that if there is international pressure both parties should join hands to face it.
Parliamentarian Lakshman Kiriella said all problems could be resolved if Parliament was reconvened.
Parliament should be given the option to decide as to who should be the Prime Minister. He said the International community is eagerly watching events in Sri Lanka to see as to who the Prime Minister is and who are members of the Cabinet.

Speaking to media after a religious ceremony yesterday in Colombo, Ven.Gunawansa also appreciated the sacrifice made by the President and said the new Constitution, that was attempted to be brought should be discarded. He said that the resources in the country should be used within the country itself without giving them to foreigners and emphasised the importance of a programme to achieve that purpose.

Ven. Rathana Thera pledges support to President, PM
Parliamentarian Ven.Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday expressed his full support to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Ven. Rathana Thera added that he will cast his vote for the President and the new Government to ensure the stability of the country.
He made these observations at a press briefing held yesterday morning in Colombo.
Rathana Thera urged that Parliament be dissolved as soon as possible, so that it will ensure democracy and allow an opportunity for people to express their support.
He said the current government should first establish a proper electoral system before going into an election.
We believe that this present government under Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa shows much potential. So we request to continue the Government for three months until an electoral system is introduced to do away with preferential voting system.
I agree with President Sirisenas decision and request that Parliament be dissolved at the earliest possible opportunity. I also request Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, to give the necessary support to dissolve Parliament, Rathana Thera observed.
