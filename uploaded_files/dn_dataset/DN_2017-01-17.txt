Is picking a stock an art, science or both
The primary fact every person interested in stocks should keep in mind is that owning a stock of a company is equivalent to owning the company, which is why investing in stocks is referred to as an Equity investment. Therefore, understanding the basic terminologies of a stock market takes top priority, followed by the knowledge of how to pick the right stock.
The stock market is the central location where people who have excess wealth and companies which are in need of capital meet to fulfill their needs and demands. Luckily, we are in the era where this meeting is routed electronically and is facilitated by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), which is the only stock exchange in Sri Lanka and regulated by the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The CSE is still at its infant stage in comparison to most of its peer stock exchanges. The GDP to market capitalization, a metric to measure the size of a stock exchange, is still hovering around 28.0% for Sri Lanka.
Factors that drive the stock market
The stock market, like any other market, is driven by demand and supply for the underlying commodity, which in this context, is called a stock. The demand for a particular stock is created due to the attractiveness of the company represented by that stock. In most cases, the movement of the price of a stock is a factor of the underlying fundamentals of the company. However, in Sri Lanka, various other factors such as liquidity (how fast you can exit from a stock), participation of foreign investors and herd behavior (tendency of individuals to follow a larger group or high net worth Individuals (HNIs)) also help determine the price of a stock.
In addition to the aforesaid market-specific factors, global and local macro-economic and political developments also tend to impact price movements of the stock. When the overall economy is poised to develop, the companies within the system will start to benefit which in turn will trickle down to the performance of the CSE. Hence, investors should keep updating their knowledge on the developments happening around them in order to be successful.
Equity: a high risk and high return investment
In finance, the amount of risk taken to an investment will be compensated by the return to the investor. Hence, an investor should be cautious about the risk factors associated with the stock market. Risk factors can vary from macro-economic to political risk known as systematic risk and individual stock related risk known as specific risk. While specific risk can be mitigated through diversification, systematic risk is supposed to be borne by all investors in the market. However, in general equity investments give protection against inflation risk as opposed to a fixed income investment.

Investor checklist
There are various theories and approaches on how to pick stocks; however, not all approaches would suit all investors. Over a period of time, investors should create their own method of picking a suitable stock, based on the experience and knowledge gained along the way. Listed below is a very basic guideline on how to identify a right stock.
1. It is all about the company
At the end of the day, an investor is betting on a company and not on the stock market as a whole. Hence, devote some time on studying the company. For example, Sri Lanka has recorded a 22.4% growth in tourist arrivals every year up to 2015 since 2009 and as a result, the Sri Lankan government has earmarked tourism as a fast growing sector and provided several concessions to the industry. Based on this development, an investor can easily presume that any company which is in the business of tourism (Hotels and Travels sector) is benefiting from this growth. But in the CSE, there are about 38 companies being listed under this sector and not all of these companies will perform well. Hence an investor would still have to analyze the company irrespective of the sector to pick the better stock to invest in.
2. Fundamentals
Using the same example as above, it is not practical to invest in all 38 counters just because the sector is poised to benefit. Thus, the starting point is to screen companies based on their respective financial statements (a companys financials can be freely downloaded from the CSE website). Various financial ratios can be calculated to understand how a company has performed over the years. In order to keep things simple, an investor can start off by calculating a few basic ratios and comparing it with industry ratios. Basic ratios can include, but are not limited to, revenue growth, earnings growth, gross profit margin, net profit margin, interest coverage and debt to capital ratio.
It is not always that a company can repeat its historical performance again and again. Therefore, an investor should be vigilant of any developing story on the respective industry and the company, in order to stay abreast with any new developments regarding the investment.
3. How much an investor pays for a stock will determine the return
An investor does not want to pay more than what a company deserves, that is its intrinsic (true) value. If the market price of a company is lower than its intrinsic value then it is considered to be an undervalued company and vice versa.
Relative based valuation is one of the three main methods used by analysts to derive intrinsic value for a company. The P/E ratio (calculated as the market price per share (MPS) divided by earnings per share (EPS)) is a good indicator to measure how much the investor community is willing to pay for one rupee of earnings of a company. The usual belief is that the lower P/E stocks (in comparison to their peers and their respective industry) are a good buy. However, an investor should also note that if a companys P/E is trading at a discount for a longer period then investors may be purposefully paying a lower price for that company due to various negative reasons such as ineffective management, stagnant industry, declining sales, higher borrowing costs, etc.
4. Growth stocks
On the other hand, an investor may encounter a stock trading with a premium P/E ratio for a continuous period than its peers and/or industry. These types of stocks are classified as growth stocks as investors are willing to pay a higher price, keeping in mind the companys future earnings growth potential.
5. Dividend paying/ value stocks
Investing in stocks, unlike any other asset class, will give an investor a benefit from capital appreciation and dividend income (not all the counters listed in the CSE pay out dividend and they are not obliged to do so as well. It will be at the discretion of the management to decide upon the dividend). Hence, an investor can screen for a company with dividend paying history before investing, in order to ensure a periodic payment, while waiting to benefit from capital appreciation.
High dividend yield (Dividend Per share (DPS) / MPS) companies are often regarded as mature companies and they do not find any suitable investments to be made other than paying out for its investors. These types of stocks are known as Value Stocks.
How to be a successful investor
How an investor acts after investing is also as important as picking right portfolio of stocks;
1. Liquidate a stock that achieves the expected return
It is pivotal to determine an expected return before making the investment. The expected return can be based on various measures, but the more popular approach is to add a risk premium (an additional return expected for investing in the stock market) to the T-bill rate. For example, if the one year T-Bill is trading at 10%, an equity risk premium of 5.0% (this may vary depending on the investors circumstances) can be added for an investor to arrive at an expected return of 15% from his investment over a period of time. Despite any lingering factors, an investor should liquidate a stock once his/her target return has been achieved.
2. Cut loss strategy
Getting out of a losing position at the right time is as important as selling the stock once it achieves the target return. An investor should do away any emotional attachment towards any stock and if prices have fallen below a certain percentage, he/she needs to liquidate the stocks. For example, if a particular stock has fallen by 10% then to recover and to realize profit, it has to rise by over 12%. Hence it is vital for an investor to determine his/her loss bearing percentage after finding the right stocks.
3. Review quarterly results of the stocks in the portfolio
All businesses are in an uncertain and a dynamic environment; which is why the investor community should always be vigilant about their investments. It is recommended that an investor should review quarterly financials published by a company (in a year, four quarterly financials will be released by a listed company) of every stock in their portfolio and if at all there is any major negative deviations in revenue and/or profit, an appropriate decision must be made after talking to their investment advisors.
4. Diversify your portfolio, but dont overdo it
Diversification (investing in different sectors) will act as a resistant of freefalling portfolio value. In the CSE, there are about 20 sectors. So it is important for an investor community to choose stocks from different sectors that will diversify their portfolio. For example, when interest rates are falling, stocks in consumer durables and real-estate are expected to perform well due to increased consumption levels, whereas banking stocks tend to be stagnant.
If an investor over diversifies, then effective management of his/her portfolio will be minimal. In theory, having 30 stocks in a portfolio will provide an investor with a high degree of diversification.

Anthonian and Colts stalwart Ranjith Samarasekera no more
Former St Anthonys College sportsman and stalwart of Colombo Colts Cricket Club Ranjith Samarasekera passed away in Colombo yesterday following a brief illness at the age of 76.
Samarasekera lost his memory and was confined to bed after suffering from a fall in his bathroom two years ago. He was unable to communicate with people and his health gradually deteriorated.
Samarasekera was an outstanding sportsman at St Anthonys College excelling at athletics and cricket being one time Public Schools javelin champion. He was the first recipient of the Double Eagle award (athletics and cricket), the highest prize presented by the school for sports.
At cricket Samarasekera was an all-rounder. He bowled left-arm leg-spin and was an excellent close in fielder in addition to his batting. He was a contemporary of ACM Lafir, the former All-Ceylon cricketer and opening bat and represented his school from 1955-58.
Ranjith came to St Anthonys from Maris Stella Negombo and gave his heart and soul to the old boys welfare activities at school and went out of his way to organize events, said Lafir in tribute to a former team mate. He even at times neglected his business to attend to school activities. He was a loyal Anthonian.
Samarasekera was a stalwart at Colombo Colts CC whom he represented after school and was a live wire at all the clubs activities. He was coach, president and patron of the club. He was also a national cricket selector and during his period three former Anthonian cricketers played for Sri Lanka in Test cricket  Muthiah Muralitharan, Piyal Wijetunge and Ruwan Kalpage.
Samarasekera is best remembered for the role he played in the Saints Quadrangular  the flagship event of the Old Boys of the four premier Catholic schools in Sri Lanka - St. Anthonys College Katugastota, St. Benedicts College Kotahena, St. Josephs College Colombo and St. Peters College Bambalapitiya.
Samarasekera, a pioneer member of the inaugural organizing committee in 1963 was a pillar of strength to the Saints Quadrangular convincing the OBUs of the four schools subsequent to the inaugural event to make it an annual event. He was present at every organizing committee since then.
At the 47th Saints Quadrangular in 2014 Samarasekera was honoured when a trophy named Ranjith Samarasekera Challenge Trophy was donated by Old Peterites Sports Club to be awarded to the winners of the Rugby Sevens in recognition of his commitment and excellent service rendered by him towards the success of the tournament.
Samarasekara is survived by his three children  two sons and daughter.
His remains lie at AF Raymonds funeral parlour Borella and his funeral takes place tomorrow at Borella Cemetary.  ST

Anura Tennekoon a luminary of cricket
I had the privilege of meeting Anura Tennekoon at the local Mecca of cricket at the Sinhalese Sports Club, recently. He was my captain when Ceylon Schools played against the All India Schools, in Colombo in the mid sixties. Anura went on to captain Sri Lanka with distinction where as I went to UK looking for greener pastures. It is interesting to note that the Indian Schools team included players in the caliber of Eknath Solkar and Surinder Amarnath who went on to represent India. Dyan Pathiravithane (a fellow scribe at present) of Ananda College also participated in that match.
Anura captained S Thomas Mount Lavinia in 1966 and I was the captain of Ananda the same year. I can vividly recall how the last man and I saved the day for our College. Tennekoon and Sriyantha Rajapakse, both top class spinners in school cricket those days were hell bent on breaking our partnership, but we survived in spite of the mildest form of sledging confined to words to the effect of Oh Hell. In that year I scored only one fifty and that too against Dharmapala Pannipitiya. In this instance against the Thomians I set my stall and it was difficult for Sriyantha and Anura to dislodge me.
This match was played at Vihara Maha Devi Park on a matting wicket in Colombo 7. The Thomians rattled us for 81 in the first innings, in reply they scored 228 for 7 wickets, Anandians scored 198 for 9, Subhash Sumanasuriya still a close friend of mine scored an elegant 51. (These scores came to me through the kind courtesy of Dr Harendra Kularatne who participated in the 1963 Ananda College cricket team.)
After saving the game for Ananda, my partner the last man and I sauntered into the pavilion, dog tired. It was a hot day and we were itching to quench our thirst with water, but to our surprise we were confronted with a couple of crates of beer which was smuggled into the dressing room by some enthusiastic old boys. Our glee was short lived because our coach at that time All Ceylon cricketer, dashing Dhanasiri Weerasinghe made a quickstep to the proceedings and one of our reserves who was clean as a whistle, was given the task of emptying them one by one to a gutter next to the pavilion. The enthusiastic members of our team who were used to the brown coloured frothy liquid even at that tender age were naturally crestfallen. Three cheers were raised by the two teams after the match, with the aroma of beer emanating from the gutter nearby which everybody in the dressing room could whiff but no action could be taken. The aftermath of the proceedings was to leave Anura and Co gnashing their teeth with frustration causing their Thomian grit to end up in dust.
As a schoolboy in 1965 Anura was selected to play for Ceylon against Mike Smiths Englishmen in a whistle stop game in Colombo. His latent talent was spotted by none other than the late D.D. Jayasinghe. From then on he went on to adorn Sri Lanka cricket, not only as a brilliant batsman, whose on driving to me was on par with Peter May, but also as the manager of the Sri Lanka Test team till recently. If Anura Tennekoon was born a few decades earlier we would have had the equivalent of Sunil Gavaskar in our Test team. His technique was water tight. He mentioned to me that he preferred to play more on the onside, thereby cutting the risk of opening the face of the bat and being vulnerable in edging towards the slips. Budding young batsmen who are up against it in South Africa at present should make a note of this
Anura had the good fortune of facing the crme de la crme of the Indian spinners of his era, the likes of Bishen Singh Bedi, Erapalli Prasanna, Chandrasekhar and Venkatraghavan. In comparison Anura stated that Bedi was the best out of the lot, his action was fluid, to watch him approach the wicket and roll that arm over was a sublime experience stated Anura. He recalled that Prasanna gets the mantle of being the craftiest off spinner he had faced, due to his subtle variation of flight and spin. I can recall that Prasanna could let the ball hang in the air due to the top spin he imparts to it so that the ball dips and drops about a foot shorter than the batsman expect it. Anura recalls that Venkat used his height to get bounce and was also a prodigious spinner of the ball. As regards Chandrasekhar, Tennekoon was of the opinion that he was freakish and temperamental.
If we had a batsman of the caliber of Anura Tennekoon and of course Kumar Sangakkara, it would have been a different ball game in South Africa where we were whitewashed in the Test series. This harrowing experience will serve us as a good learning curve for the talented young batsmen from whom much is expected in the future. As for the pace bowlers they have been toe to toe with their South African counterparts, which is commendable.

Ariana and John join hands for Beauty and the Beast
Ariana Grande and John Legend have reportedly teamed up to record the title track of Beauty and the Beast for the upcoming movie remake.
The 23-year-old singer teased the news when she shared a snap of herself in the studio on her Instagram page, tagging both John and Beauty and the Beast in the picture, before sharing with a wilted rose emoji on her Twitter.
The shot was also shared by the official Instagram page of the new Beauty and the Beast film.
Fans were quick to speculate on what Ariana meant, before Hits Daily Double reported that Ariana and John will be singing the main song from the film's soundtrack, originally made famous by Celine Dion and Peabo Bryson. John, however, made no reference to Ariana's tag in his social media posts.
It's not the first time Ariana has taken on a Celine classic - she previously impersonated the singer's rendition of the tune when she appeared on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon back in March, 2015. She also revisited the impersonation when she hosted Saturday Night Live last year (16), and admitted the Canadian singer was impressed by her mimicking.
"When I met Celine, she told me, she was like, When I saw you, I peed! Ariana said during a chat on Elvis Duran and The Morning Show. Im just a big fan! I'm a really big fan. I think that's why they (the celebrities I mimic) don't get mad because they know that I come from a place of love and I'm just like, 'You're f***ing amazing!'"
Emma Watson and Dan Stevens take on the roles of Belle and the Beast in the upcoming live action remake, with a recently released clip for the movie displaying the former Harry Potter star's impressive vocal talents. The prospect of singing in the film was a scary one for Emma, who told Total Film magazine previously: "I sing, so thats really unexpected. Ive never had to do that for a film role before, and I think people will be interested to see me do something very different like that.
"It gives me a different challenge, really. Thats terrifying in and of itself!
The movie also stars Emma Thompson, Ewan McGregor, Josh Gad, Gugu Mbatha-Raw and Luke Evans, and is due for release in March.

Art from the heart
One place, many perspectives - this is the vision behind Kala Pola which unfolds annually along the sidewalks of Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha, Colombo 7.
This year marks the 24th edition of Sri Lankas renowned open-air art fair which will begin on January 22 at 8 am. Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson will be the Chief Guest at the event. Presented by The George Keyt Foundation in association with John Keells Group Kala Pola has become one of the most prominent events in the countrys art calendar in terms of celebrating art as well as drawing in tourists. Opening free of charge to its visitors Kala Pola sees gifted artistes from all over the island on one street displaying their talent to the world.
I was there since the inception of the event in 1993. I believe that I got my big break then and I grew up as an artist with Kala Pola. We also got an opportunity to deal with foreigners face to face. We made many contacts and began a network. Such experiences are invaluable, said Ramani Silva.
She notes that around 15 artists were given the chance to be a part of the first Kala Pola. Many of them still come to take part in this event each year.
Though I do art in all types of media I specialize in oil paint. However there will be several water colour and line drawings at my stall at Kala Pola. Around 25 to 30 paintings will be on display. Most of them are landscapes, she said.
Ramani says that she has seen the art fair growing from strength to strength each year.
We did not even have a roof over our head when we started off in the maiden Kala Pola. Then we were given more and more facilities as the event became a success. We are given beautiful stalls now with other facilities. I got this opportunity through The George Keyt foundation, she said.
Sameera Kalupahana has been a part of Kala Pola since 1997. Hailing from Beruwala he says that Kala Pola breaks the barriers for artists to approach the modern world.
An open-air art fair was an unfamiliar concept for the public. Art used to be limited to places like the temples and shrine as well as inside buildings then. At times artists who have only inborn talent but no academic knowledge too is brought before the limelight through various means.
I believe that a certain academic knowledge matters to enhance the quality of the art. The situation is quite different now. More and more artists are seeking academic knowledge. It is the performance of the artists which are highlighted by the media but I believe that discussions are equally important. I see the modern face of Kala Pola as a step toward that direction, he noted.
Sameera is a figurative artist. A member of Vibhavi Academy of Fine Art he says that his art is rooted in the realistic qualities of life. He is versed in many media but water colours are his favourite.
Janaki Nadeeshani is from Delgoda. She is a graduate of the University of Fine Arts. She specializes on sculptures and has her own art shop in her home town.
I have made many contacts by taking part in Kala Pola. I will be presenting about seven sculptures at this years event. My art comprises portraits, traditional art and assemble art, she said adding that sculptures can be done in clay, bronze, copper and metal.
Rasika de Silva is from Ambalangoda. He too has been a regular member of Kala Pola.
This is the only event in which artists, collectors, and art enthusiasts get together. We can feast our eyes upon the art that artists have been doing throughout the year. Artists can also make a few bucks for their efforts at this event, Rasika said.
He hopes to present around 25 paintings for the event under the theme of the battle between man and nature as well as the collusion between man and man. He has also displayed his work at eight solo exhibitions and 10 group exhibitions.

Australian couple re-noticed to appear in Court
Australian businessman Brian Shaddick and his wife were yesterday re-noticed to appear in Court on March 16 by the Colombo High Court to testify in connection with an indictment filed against Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila and another, accused for allegedly misappropriating Rs. 21 million following their alleged fraudulent share transaction that took place in 2000.
When the case came up before High Court Judge A.A.R. Heiyanthuduwa, it was fixed for trial on March 16 and two witnesses Brian Shaddick and his wife were re-noticed to appear in Court on the next date.
The Court ordered the Court registrar to dispatch the summons through the Foreign Affairs Ministry. The Court was informed that the witnesses had not been served the summons to appear in Court.
Meanwhile, first accused Udaya Gammanpila withdrew an application he had earlier made that he be allowed to travel to Kuwait.
Gammanpila and Sydney Jayasinghe are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General alleged that Gammanpila has cheated Rs. 20 million and misappropriated another Rs. 21 million along with Sydney Jayasinghe, the second accused when selling shares of Digital Nominees to a businessman called Dhammika Perera.
The Attorney General further charged that the alleged business transaction had taken place using a fraudulent power of attorney to sell shares belonging to Australian businessman Brian Shadick.
The Attorney General has listed 20 persons as the witnesses in the case and named 16 documents as production items in the case.
Gammanpila was arrested in this regard on June 18, 2016.

Automakers divided over safety, tax benefit for small cars
The automotive industry is vertically divided over a government policy that encourages production of small vehicles: lower tax on cars and SUVs measuring 4 metres or less.
One side opposes the differential treatment, arguing that it would be tough to meet the upcoming crash and emission regulations while also staying within the vehicle length rules to claim the tax benefit.
Manufactures on the other side who want it to continue say small cars, too, can meet any safety or emission standards. Everyone agrees that the policy has helped make India one of the largest manufactures of small cars in the world.
But small cars made in India for local sales had often failed crash tests, such as those conducted by UKs Global NCAP, even as the manufacturers claimed that they were made according to rules in India where the tests werent compulsory. From October 1this year, however, all new models sold in India will have to be put through crash tests.
What happens in the future  with new crash regulations and new emission regulations, asked Vikram Kirloskar, vice-chairman of Toyota Kirloskar Motors. In sub-fourmetre vehicles, especially in diesel cars, the passenger compartment will get squeezed if they are to effectively meet the crash and emission regulations, he said. So you lose a lot of stuff  will not be able meet these safety norms.
Passenger vehicles with length up to 4 metres and 1.5 litre or smaller engines attract a 12.5% excise duty, the lowest in the industry. Beyond that, the the tax rate can range from 24% to 30%. Carmakers launched a slew of sedans and SUVs smaller than 4 metres to get the tax benefit. Some added a boot to their hatchbacks, while some others chopped a little tail from longer sedans to stay within the limit.
Between April and November last year, 41.3% of the total passenger vehicles sold India measured between 3.5 metres and 4 metres and had engines of up to 1.4 litre. To be sure, Toyota Kirloskar, the local unit of Toyota Motor, has not been very successful in Indias small car space.

Beat the holiday hangover with humour!
You wouldnt think with Christmas and the New Year barely out of sight that anyone would be campaigning for another holiday. But I am. I need a holiday from the holidays. I am exhausted. Not just tired. I am knackered, bushed, and dead beat. After much reflection I have decided that I suffer from chronic Holiday Hangover.
Of course that is a valid medical condition! I discovered it and diagnosed the symptoms myself. And more likely than not, you suffer from it too. No one needs a vacation so much as the person who has just had one. Besides, its the perfect time to find el-cheapo vacation bargains. When the hustle of the holiday season slows down, the deals heat up in the travel industry. Its called the holiday offshoot when travellers can find secret pockets of savings in some unlikely places.
Now post-holiday hangover has nothing to do with alcohol. Ok, ok, maybe it does a little. Fine, I agree possibly more than a little. But that is just the final leg of a mad relay that makes holidays a life-sucking experience. Holiday hangover is the feeling of complete depletion you get after any and pretty much every major holiday.
Come on, admit it. You all know exactly what Im talking about. You know that, after a holiday weekend, comes a blue Monday feeling constraining you to begin begging for an extra day to recoup. If you are Sri Lankan you know exactly what Im talking about. Yes that is because all of you are party animals, of the nava gilunath band choon types. And it goes without saying that we all belong to the most hospitable clan in the world which pounces on any excuse to put a party.
It begins with the preparations. That is because no self-respecting Sri Lankan family just gathers for a quiet seasonal lunch. Actually, theres no such thing as a quiet luncheon in Sri Lankan families. But, getting back to the blessed event, preparations for the holidays are as detailed and complicated as a royal wedding.
What usually starts out as just immediate family quickly degenerates into a cast of scores of extras. Of course the third cousins can come too! They are family after all! They want to bring along their friends and lonely neighbours. No problem! And before you know it things go from family gathering to public function.
Lets start with the refreshments. There is no such thing as having enough food and drinks available. If you think 30 people are coming, you cater for 60. Then when one of them asks if they can bring something your standard answer would be no.
God forbid that guests dont get that fourth serving. If each person doesnt take home a doggy bag that lasts a week, then you havent done your job. And when it comes to drinks, well, lets just say Sri Lankans really know how to throw a party.
Even when you start out with enough alcohol to sterilise several hospital wards, at some point during the event there will be an ice run which will produce yet more spirited beverages with their corresponding mixers. Hey, its just in case, you know! But its the kids company I long for most at holiday parties or any party for that matter. I feel they are kindred spirits, more delightfully childlike than most childishly pestilential adults.
Besides I give them credit for their intelligence and sense of humour, which far surpasses those of many moronic adults of my acquaintance. So its the end of the holiday season, but the youthful holiday spirit is still with the entertainer.
Thats because for me theres no business like show business. As for the others they are still too lethargic to get into the swing of things. Their work ethic seems to embrace the no business like no business attitude. As your unrivalled raconteur and entertainer I have been the hit of most of the seasonal parties.
Im learning how to do new routines that are normally a little above my intelligence capabilities. But you have to concede I am still one hell of a guy, after all. Yet I have devised a plan that works. I made the very youngest segment of the audience laugh, knowing that small childrens chuckles are effectively contagious. You see, to me laughter is an instant vacation as well as a vocation.
At the last bash tiny kids rolled over chortling uproariously over my jokes. All the others including some snooty adults went into guffaws at their delightful gurgling giggles. But a while later just as their parents are having a good time they begin their baby whining cries and insist that they head for home. Their parents begin reading the riot act to them and berating them with long homilies on responsibility and behaviour.
The tiniest sextet of four-year-old brats begin a howling cacophony of sobbing and rolling on the floor in limb thrashing tantrums. Thats when I begin prowling the parquet like a panther while a bunch of hooligans begin lighting firecrackers on the podium outside the apartment.
Above the thunder of firecracker blasts I find a packet of unused balloons. I stretch a couple of them and announce quite loudly that I am going to defend our beleaguered fortress that had come under enemy fire. All fighting troops to the battlements. We are under siege, I yell. I stride purposefully into the pantry and fill a couple of balloons with tap water. The tantrums and sobbing subside and are replaced by morbid curiosity as they follow me to the balcony.
I fling the water-filled balloons with deliberation at the firework fanatics below while intoning dramatically: Bombs away! The children watch fascinated as the water-bombs explode on impact in a showery cascade of silver liquid sending the drenched pyrotechnic pirates scuttling for cover. The little ones clap in glee and chortle uncontrollably while looking up at me with worshipful eyes. Even the seemingly uninterested teenagers titter hysterically and glance at me with respectful admiration.
Yes siree, the old man had bombed the rest of the adult clan clean out of the popularity stakes. It was a detoxifying restorative to my jaded spirits. And anyone who imagines that real heroes suffer from holiday hangover should have their heads examined!

Blue Ocean Group upbeat on condominium sector
The Blue Ocean Group is upbeat on the country's condominium sector. Blue Ocean Group Chairman S Thumilan said optimism reigns in Sri Lanka with capital flows into the country the economy expected to increase during 2017, giving a major boost to the countrys burgeoning property industry.
Through Budget 2017 the Government has introduced wide-ranging initiatives to support and encourage the construction and infrastructure industry in general and condominium sector of Sri Lanka,Thumilan said. Budget 2017 presented by the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) has proposed many positive and encouraging changes that would undoubtedly boost the property, construction and infrastructure sectors of the country, he said.
The Government has re-emphasised the huge potential for the construction industry anticipating it to grow into a fully-fledged Rs. 6,500 billion high-value industry in the next five years.
It is pertinent to note that the burgeoning condominium industry has been identified as a sector with significant potential for foreign investment. We laud Finance Ministers initiative to further incentivise such investment, remove freehold right restrictions from the ground floor. Hitherto foreign investors could purchase fourth floor and above only sans the 100% transaction levy. Allowing foreigners to purchasing condominiums, up to 40 percent of the cost from a domestic bank is also another positive step. With the servicing of such debt mandated to be done foreign currency will ensure more foreign exchange flowing into the industry. I have always said that the success of the Blue Ocean Group of Companies is in creating organic growth which cascades to effective solutions geared to meet global challenges.
This in turn contributes positively to the global development agenda and to the eco-system that we all contribute to.
When I founded the Blue Ocean Group, I was very keen that the Group would become the differentiator in the landscape we operated in. This is the universal Blue Ocean Strategy that we at the Blue Ocean Group of Companies are following. We are well grounded and founded in realistic and practical data; we pursue differentiation and economies of scale; we create uncontested market spaces, not really wanting to outperform competition but making competition irrelevant by reconstructing boundaries.
We empower our team through tools and frameworks to break away from competition and assess current industry status to maximise opportunity while minimising risk. Our processes and tools are inclusive, comprehensive and easily communicated. And this binds all our stakeholders into a single platform, ultimately creating a win-win formula of value, profit and people.
The Groups consistent year on year improvement in financial results is an signal of the financial sustainability of our business model. To ensure the sustainability of the social and environmental aspects associated with our business, we continue to embrace best practices for social and environmental management. From a social perspective, our infrastructure projects across the country have a significant bearing on the communities in the area and improved the standard of living of our stakeholders. Our work to empower these communities has no doubt in Blue Ocean Group being an exemplary corporate citizen in Sri Lanka. The Blue Ocean Group of Companies has grown into a formidable leader and trendsetter in over six industries including real estate, construction, engineering, trading, education and corporate consultancy. Our dynamism is seen in the global networks and projects we have spawned and the expansion we fuel in Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East and Asia, especially the UAE, UK, USA, Canada and Australia.
As a Group, we are very focused on quality to which there is no compromise. It is this that has been the overarching umbrella to our sustainable success, in each project we embark upon.

Breaking the ice for mega foreign investment projects
With the dawn of another year, the country has embarked on a number of ambitious projects in many parts of the country. The vital aspect for the success of these projects lies in the evaluation, negotiation and convincing of stake holders including the public.
All political parties need to pull in one direction for the development in this country. In the eighties Thailand, Singapore, Taiwan, Malaysia, Hongkong and recently Vietnam, the political scenario was conducive for rapid foreign investment promotion.
They built the infrastructure quickly and invited the foreign investors to invest on terms favourable for those countries. We were very slow in building our infrastructure and wasted tax payer money on an unwanted war, mismanagement of state enterprises, thamashas, every year elections and massive corruption which resulted in continuous annual budget deficits. We cannot afford a large number of politicians. Right now we have 225 members of parliament, nearly 500 provincial councilors and nearly 4,500 local government politicians with majority engaging in corrupt practices looting the country from the very first day in office.
In addition their staff, security personnel, family members and friends help themselves with perks, luxury vehicles, bribes, kick backs and other privileges. All in all around 30,000 people loot the resources of this country in every government.
In addition, they help their supporters by providing them with non existent jobs in the state sector adding to the salary and pension bills of the country. We never had systems or good governance from the time of independence upto now. Sad to say, the main political parties looted this country taking turns.
The development drive of this country has two main eras, i.e. before the commencement of north east hostilities and after the cessation of hostilities. The first period moved at a very slow pace and the government which came to power in 1977 could have concluded all infrastructure developments in their first period of 6 years, including highways, roads, power supply, telephone lines, ports and airports.
Unfortunately, they were sitting ducks. Funds were available as grants and long term soft loans with very low interests and grace periods. One must not forget the contributions of Ministers Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali in infrastructure development. But the others did not make a worthwhile contribution. Post 2009 May funding attracted commercial rates.
As a country with a substantial budget deficit we cannot afford high debt servicing. Hence consumers were burdened with a variety of taxes including the Value added tax. We experienced Vat fraud, oil hedging, Low quality petrol, Norochcholai power plant breakdowns, tax amnesties and are now going through controversies in central bank bonds, low quality rice, coal tenders, drug rackets and so on.
This will never stop until we quickly develop systems for good governance, monthly internal audits and the immediate establishment of the Audit Commission, rigid budgetary control and hiring of experienced professionals for tax collection at inland revenue, excise department and at customs and most importantly reduction in the number of members in provincial councils and local government instituitions.
However, there are talks to increase the number of local government members to over 6,000 and a 25% reservation to the fairer sex. Whatfor
They will fight amongst themselves for personal wealth accumulation totally neglecting the people.
No foreign/local investor will come to Sri Lanka since they will have to pay bribes first to get the projects approved and then in running their projects. Crime rate will automatically go up due to political rivalry. Even the JVP wanted to bring in amendments as far as the qualifications to contest elections in 2015 beginning. Now they too are silent on this. Where are we heading
Now let us consider the present difficulties in getting the mega development projects of the country approved. Each political party commits more grave mistakes and bunglings citing the misdeeds of the previous government. A workable formula and a criteria in approving the mega development projects for the country is outlined below in brief. Commitment to resolve by all parties is a must.
We now have a police commission, finance commission and a constitutional council to study and analyse core areas of the country. Similarly we should set up an economic development committee consisting of 10 members including the president, Prime Minister, subject minister and leaders of parties representing the parliament, including the joint opposition.
This committee should meet every week and reach mutual agreements on all mega projects followed by a press conference to explain matters in a more organized manner to instill confidence in the minds of public and residents of the area. All ideologies such as capitalism, socialism, communism, Marxist and other ideologies should reach a common understanding for sustained economic development of the country considering the grave plight our country is in now.
Media heads should be appraised of the progress and decisions reached by this committee and be requested to report on an impartial manner. The recent examples of differences of opinion among political parties, clergy and other organisations are creating chaos and uncertainty on the part of foreign investors. They will think twice before investing in Sri Lanka. The financial, technical and environmental evaluations are of paramount importance.
After this, the proposed above committee should go through the recommendations on a daily basis and come to a conclusion and reach agreement with the foreign investors within 2 to 4 weeks. The evaluation committee should act in the best interest of the country rather than on personal wealth boosting or to serve the interests of their respective political parties. No public protests, marches and expressions of opinion be allowed until the committee makes its decision.
Leaders of political parties could appraise their fellow parliamentarians and advise them not to engage in protest campaigns in the common interest of the country. The members of parliament could forward their recommendations to their party representative at the committee and get feedback after every sitting of this committee. Loss of FDI opportunities will reroute the FDI flow to other countries like Vietnam, Myanmar and other south Asian countries who are in competition with Sri Lanka for foreign direct investments.
The media both electronic and print have a big role to play in this context rather than filling up sensational stories for their respective media routes. Upto 1992 we had only 2 major TV channels in the country, namely, SLRC, ITN and one radio station, namely SLBC.
However, with the escalation of war media organisations mushroomed since the general public placed reliance and a liking for private media to receive facts, especially on war since they felt that the governmental media sources are not coming out with the true stories.
As the literacy levels of people in remote areas are at a low level, they always look for sensational stories to get themselves engaged in talking about them on a daily basis. This also brought down the productivity standards of the country as well. Even now private media highlight stories of political background & crime in their daily news roundup and news bulletins. One can compare the news bulletins of developed countries such as UK, USA, European countries with that of our country and see the difference. A foreigner staying in Sri Lanka will realize the stupidity of our people and the members of political parties. Prior to end of war, the news bulletins of both state and private media reported over 80% of their news coverage on war& explosions.
Now let us consider some of the recent mass protests for development projects. Norochcholai power plant attracted lot of criticism. Inaddition, Hambantotta port and airport, Southern Highway, Sampur Power Plant also attracted many thoughts. All these projects should have been discussed jointly by all political parties with a view of getting the best deal for our country from the foreign investors. Privatisation of AirLanka and the handing over of management rights to Emirates in 1998 also drew a major debate at the parliament.
Instead a parliamentary commission could have discussed matters and reached an optimum solution. Sri Lanka telecom was another institution where conflict situations arose. Right now Sri Lanka Telecom is doing well and the public are benefitted by their rapid and efficient services. Strategic alliance of Sri Lanka Telecom with an overseas partner enabled the provision of telephone connections to a large number with great value addition.
In the pre 1990 era telephone landline was a luxury and it took sometimes years for a member of the public to get a telephone connection to the residence or to a business premises. The Matara Colombo Highway is netting high turnovers and the motorists and the general public save around three hours of valuable time in reaching their destinations.
To avoid all these problems it is far better to approach all development projects on an early bird basis. with the subject minister meeting foreign investor to discuss the core areas such as project cost, funding, land requirements, environmental concerns, employment creation and then discuss same without delay with the president and the prime minister. The trio would then decide on the terms of the agreement with the foreign investor and discuss same with the investor. If agreement is reached between all parties, the subject minister will proceed to prepare a cabinet paper showing the advantages of the project with an estimated forex flow statement.
The cabinet approval should be immediately followed up by an all party meeting to discuss the project, including the joint opposition. Inputs further required to the terms could be discussed at length by the same committee within 2 weeks to reach finality. The foreign investor will be briefed immediately on new suggestions and a draft agreement could be presented at the next all party meeting to ratify the amended draft agreement. By this way the project approval will not be necessary by the parliament involving lengthy debates suiting political agendas. The project will kick start within weeks if the project approval is carried out in this manner.
Ruling governments should devise methodologies to avoid confrontations with other political parties and general public in carrying out mega investment projects in the country.
A job bank should also be created to recruit the most suitable staff for the projects including the unemployed graduates/diploma holders. Top financial experts should be employed to handle the financial control of the project backed up by an efficient internal audit unit working in the night time also, if required. Political appointments should be totally done away with in recruiting staff. Round the clock security be also provided to the project until completion and for smooth functioning.
Attaining unit be opened by the foreign investor for the local staff also briefing them of working ethics prior to employing them. The workers should be given the best of working conditions and welfare measures.
The project profile should include the following evaluative criteria amongst others.
1. Lease period
This period should not be lower than the periods offered by other FDI seeking countries in Asia such as Vietnam, Myanmar, India, Bangladesh and others.
2. Quantum of Initial forex down payment
3. Liquidated damages clause in the agreement for both parties.
4. Arbitration clause
5. The proportion of foreign direct labour to be engaged in the project, by the foreign investor
6. Adherence to environmental laws of the country
7. Adherence to local by-laws of the country
8. Mode of project---BOO/BOT basis
9. Liability to local taxes and tax rebates/exemptions offered
10. Compensation payable to state/private owners for the land
11. Status of project Joint Venture, Limited Liability Company or other form
12. Introduction of hitherto unused technology in Sri Lanka
13. Threat to local industries
14. Threat to farmers and agricultural output of the country
15.Availability of suitable infrastructure to undertake the project
16. Impact on external/local debt burden of the country
17. Disturbance to any place of religious worship, educational institute or other social project
18. Green effects of the project and possible environmental pollution
19. Number of Technical/consultancy staff to be brought in by the foreign investor and the visa. Requirements to remain in the country until project completion and after
20. A direct forex inflow/outflow during the project period and for the first 10 years after completion
21. A local cash flow statement in rupees both before and after completion of project in local currency
22. Effects on local currency and possible depreciation of rupee
23. Level of straining of relationships with neighbouring countries and super powers of the world
24. Viability of the project and feasibility study prepared by a top accountancy firm in Sri Lanka
25. High tech Security requirements of the project
26. Rate of interest for foreign funding
27.Rate of interest on any state sponsored loans
Brainstorming sessions be held to sort out inadequacies in above criteria to sign the agreement with the foreign investors. This process will avoid all misunderstandings with the parties involved and pave the way for early approval of all mega foreign investment projects. It is always advisable to seek alternative offers from different countries before finalization of the most suitable investor. Flexibility on the part of the foreign investor in meeting the above criteria and requirements is vital to maintain a cordial relationship.
The foreign investors should understand the cultural, social, religious and political backgrounds and make an honest endeavor to offer s Sri Lanka with the best possible terms and conditions to engage in the project with a view of assistance to Sri Lanka while meeting their returns on investment.
Our youth should take blame for not applying for semi skilled and unskilled jobs in the private sector and the private sector is now faced with a severe labour shortage especially for the construction industry as our youth have got used to easy jobs like security personnel, peons, delivery boys.
Some lease out three wheelers adding upto the already exceeded three wheelers on streets and they run without meters and charge fancy amounts from the general public who use their services. As a result we are in need of foreign labour for our essential development projects even.
I wish to mention the very favourable strategic location of our country in terms of global trade and global defence needs. Sri Lanka is perched at the middle of the world and has a very high percentage of English speaking population when compared to other Asian and African countries. Western music and films are followed by a vast number of youth, middle aged and senior citizens.
Other than USA and UK, Sri Lanka comes high in the table where western music and films are followed. Even the veteran Hollywood and British Actors and Actresses are well remembered by all sections of our people. Our western film fans have fond memories of English/American movies even now.
I wish to also talk about a scenario where our SAARC member country Pakistan took advantage of its geographical location to receive economic aid internationally. In 2001 Pakistan made use of its proximity to Afghanistan to get a huge foreign debt waiver benefit from the mighty United States of America as the Americans wanted a good relationship with Pakistan.
In December 2001, the Paris club did this by cutting Pakistans foreign debt by us$12 billion. IMF also provided additional funding to Pakistan. As a result, the Pakistani currency strengthened. Foreign direct investments started pouring to Pakistan, with a good part of it ending in financial markets.
General Musharaf cleverly exploited the global security requirements to the advantage of his country he was ruling from 1998.This situation prevailed upto his ouster by other political parties. We never got this type of foreign debt waivers even after being engaged in a bloody war for nearly three decades. We must immediately prevail upon china to reduce interest rates on our loans taken prior to 2015 at this crucial juncture of our economy.
Our politicians talked about reducing the interest rate on Chinese loans to 1.4% per annum on a formula based on LIBOR on political platforms. China will have to accede to this if the formula is correct. We got into this adverse foreign currency reserve situation due to both china and India as we continuously ran high trade deficits as both countries did not open their markets to Sri Lankan produce. Indo Lanka Preferential Trade Agreement is now over 15 years old and no meaningful steps have been taken to redress the balance in Sri Lankas favour. Same applies to china and they have been charging commercial loan interest on their loans to our development projects with low repayment periods although as a country china is sitting on a mountain of foreign reserves.
They are only interested in expanding the so called silk route to their trade and defence requirements. Both China and India will have to show their true friendship and affection to the prosperity and economic progress of our country and its people. China played the cards closer to their chests firstly by assisting us to finish the north east war militarily. Then Sri Lanka had problems with procuring aid and foreign direct investments from the western countries as they were citing human rights violations on a broader basis and reconciliation among communities.
India wanted a solution to the North and East problem due to political pressures. We had to seek the assistance of China in a big way. It is true that we have had more tourist arrivals from china and India.
However, much more is to be done by these two countries in reducing the yawning trade gaps. We must start developing solid relationships with economically stable neutral countries so that as a country Sri Lanka would be a much safer country and stable in all avenues.
I sincerely hope that Sri Lanka will achieve solid economic growth and augmentation of its foreign reserves in the New Year dawned forgetting all their political ideologies and differences.

Changing traditions of Pongal festival
Jaffna was quiet the night before Thai Pongal: shops closed early, streets emptied and restaurants shuttered. Strolling through the silent lanes, one could get the idea that the city had been deserted.
But just after sundown the fireworks began, literally. Groups of teenage boys flitted in and out of alleys equipped with sparklers and small firecrackers, setting up their gear and then fleeing the scene with big smiles plastered across their faces. Loud popping sounds would follow them, and pedestrians, startled at first, flashed knowing grins.
Older men idling in the streets seemed unperturbed, but didnt hesitate to playfully reprimand the children.
Get out of here with that, you kids, A. Ramachandran, a mechanic, said sarcastically.
The children, however, would not be stopped.
This is one of the only times when we get to set off firecrackers. My parents dont like that I do this, but its a lot of fun, and we only do it rarely, said R. Srinivasan, a 16-year-old from Jaffna. He confessed that he and his group of friends had been saving up in order to buy more firecrackers than they did last year.
We are just celebrating the new year. Our way of celebrating and giving thanks for the harvest is setting these off, he said.
As the night progressed, the bangs intensified and the choruses of booming reports punctuated my sleep.
The next day, I awoke early and walked down to Cargills Square, one of Jaffnas main business hubs, and was greeted by groups of people standing outside of their houses, businesses and places of work. They were cooking Pongal, a traditional dish of rice, green gram, cashews, raisins, and jaggery and had set up elaborate decorations.
Outside a bank, a group of adults sat cooking and chatting, inviting passersby to partake in their Pongal.
Today we are saying thank you to the sun, for without the sun nothing would grow, said N. Nirmalan, the manager of a bank branch.
I am celebrating with my employees. We have been here since 6:30 in the morning, and we will be here until 10:30. It is nice to celebrate with co-workers and to start the New Year auspiciously, he added.
Nirmalan said that he would visit his relatives and friends in the afternoon and evening.
Like most holidays, Thai Pongal allows people to celebrate in their own specific ways. While Nirmalan was intent on thanking his employees for their good work before rejoicing with his family, others chose to review how far their communities have come in the past seven-plus years.
This year I am giving thanks for the progress we have made. Now we can live happy and freely without so much worry. I am most thankful for the ability to be more care-free, said V. Balakrishnan, an employee at a local NGO.
Though Thai Pongal has been celebrated for hundreds, if not thousands of years, some respondents mentioned that the holiday was slowly evolving.
When I was young, we used to play all sorts of games on Thai Pongal. I would meet my friends and play for hours. We used to celebrate at community level, where entire villages would get together and give thanks, said N. Devar, an employee at a local restaurant.
A lot of our celebrations used to be centered around temples with both friends and family. Now, though, many of the festivities have moved into the home and people are more likely to rejoice only with their families. We also dont play the same games. I preferred the earlier times, he continued, while adding that, to his knowledge, the community-based celebrations are still taking place in Mullaitivu and surrounding areas.
When asked if these statements were true, S. Yogeswaran, a business-owner, largely concurred:
We faced a lot of problems during the conflict in this area. Many people were missing from the festivities, so we took strength from one another and celebrated as communities. Since the war ended, however, I think it is true that many are choosing to spend the holiday with their families instead.
Though many reported this pronounced change in Pongal celebrations, there were still many people spending the day outside their homes.
On the way to Point Pedro, countless Kovils were filled to capacity, as people did their best to force themselves inside for the traditional midday Puja.
Each and every year I come to this temple on Thai Pongal. But, it is true that many of the younger people dont come to the Kovils as much, said M. Thondaman, a widow.
I would like to see the next generation keeping the traditions alive, but perhaps that will not happen, she continued.
Kite Festival
Though the jury is still out on the degree to which the Thai Pongal celebrations are changing, one stark example of pronounced development lay in the massive gathering on the Valvettithurai beach for a kite-flying competition.
Due to the substantial crowds, parking lots were jam-packed, and many had to walk over a kilometer to the competition venue. Along the way, food trucks and stalls served up piping hot noodles, refreshing ice cream, and spicy chickpea salads.
Several merchants hawked jewelry, clothing, and kites, enticing the visitors to spend their Pongal spending money. Once on the beach, various advertisements and flags flying the names of sponsoring companies greeted the crowds, who hailed from all over the Jaffna area.
Some opted to dip their feet in the ocean, but the vast majority perched themselves on the sand in order to win a prime view of the intricate kites.
Though the main award would go to the kite that stayed aloft for the longest period of time, perhaps more exciting was seeing the various creative three-dimensional kites that were tossed into the sky. A few of the more noteworthy were a tractor complete with four rotating wheels, a pirate ship with many sails, an airplane, a green battle tank, and a 20-foot long yellow lizard.
Each time the organizers launched a kite, a bemused murmur would trickle from the crowd and an announcer on a loudspeaker would describe the next kite that would be flown.
Flying kites is an essential aspect of celebrating Pongal, but this event is only a couple of years old. It is fun to get people together like this and celebrate with the kites. My kids are having a great time, said N. Subramaniam, a laborer from Point Pedro.
For us, these types of events are like getting back to normalcy, or a new normalcy, he continued.
The celebration at Valvettithurai represents not only a changing Pongal celebration, but also a changing Jaffna Peninsula.
The threat of violence and especially sustained violence, makes it almost impossible to hold public gatherings with many people. As the Jaffna area develops, people are resettled and the military continues to release land, it appears as though these large celebrations will only become more prevalent.
Instead of concentrating on the celebrations in the home or at village level, these fairs allow the greater community to meet and connect. The Valvettithurai gathering was easily the newest and most modern aspect of the Thai Pongal celebrations and allows one to envision a more developed, connected future for those living in the areas most affected by the civil conflict.

Respect the religious diversity
Today the whole world is in a sad situation. Everywhere there is confusion. Everywhere there is fighting.
Thousands of innocent people are being killed. Thousands of houses are being destroyed. Schools are being destroyed.
Places of worship are being attacked. Hospitals are being attacked. There are millions of refugees all over the world.
The main reason for this mess is that we do not respect others ideas. We do not respect others beliefs. We do not respect other cultures. We do not respect other religions. We do not respect other countries. We do not respect other communities.
We think only we are correct. All the others are wrong. We think only our religion is correct and great. All the other religions are wrong. We think our culture is the best.
Other cultures are of second class. We think only our country is great. Other countries are inferior.
As religious leaders we have failed to correct this situation.
Time has come to look back and see where we have gone wrong. What has gone wrong Are we doing the correct thing Are we telling the correct thing How to take the world out of this mess How to settle this confusion How to stop our followers destroying the world How to put our followers in the correct direction
We are talking hours and hours of our religious principles. We have days and days of religious celebrations. We have thousands and thousands of places of worship. But we are not telling our followers to respect other religions. We are not telling our followers to respect other ethnic groups.
We are not telling our followers to respect other cultures. We tell our followers that only our religion is correct and all other religions are incorrect. We do not teach our followers about religious harmony. We do not teach our followers of ethnic harmony. We do not tell our followers to respect other communities. We do not tell our followers to respect other religious beliefs.
So let us try to correct the world. Let us start thinking in a different way. Let us stop the fire that is burning the world. Let us stop the killings. Let us stop burning others property. Let us solve the refugee problem. Let us stop destroying others houses.
As religious leaders let us all get together and stop this menace. Let us tell our followers to respect other religions.
Let us tell our followers that people of all religions must live together like brothers and sisters. That is what all religious leaders have preached.

CMPort China to pump over US$ 400 mn on Htota port
Merchant Port Holdings (CMPort) China will invest over US dollars 400 million in the first six months of their operations in the Hambantota Port. This is for the purchasing of equipment for the container terminal.
CMPort plans to invest further on equipment in Phase II as the development of the remaining phases.In addition CMPort will pay a maximum of US$ 1.12 billion (80% of total asset value) in separate tranches within six months as per the terms of the agreement.
An official from the Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry stressed that CMPort will not utilise additional land from the much talked 15,000 acres of land allocation for their operations.
CMPorts agreement with the government involves only the land already within the existing port perimeter and 5km(1235 acres) of land belonging to the port.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe greets Chinese Amabassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang after launching Sri Lanka China Industrial Development Project in Hambantota (Picture by Rukmal Gamage)   
This land will be used for port related services necessary for the proper operation of a world-class port facility to function to its full potential. This includes a Logistics Distribution Center which will facilitate trade, supply chain management, storage, redistribution, etc., both locally and internationally.
The Joint Venture Company will be 80% owned by CMPort and 20% by Sri Lanka Ports Authority and its first preference will be towards recruiting existing employees of the Magampura Port Management Company (MPMC) based on a professional screening process.
This was the same process followed by the investors when the QEQ berth at the Port of Colombo was privatised in 1999.
CMPort has a vision to develop and expand its footprint as a global port and terminal operator and Hambantota is a port that is covered under South Asia.
Asked why a lease period of 99 years was agreed the official said that such was needed due to the upfront payment of US Dollars one billion.
The CMPort had indicated to us that breakeven period for a totally new port likely to be dependent more on transshipment cargo, is estimated to be over anything between 30 to 40 years.
A shorter land lease is not commercially feasible at all during the first few decades, for the amount of investment and development proposed.
The present Port land will be used for port related services necessary for the proper operation of a world-class port facility to function to its full potential.
This includes a Logistics Distribution Center which will facilitate trade, supply chain management, storage and redistribution, both locally and internationally.
The JV company will place first preference towards recruiting existing employees of the Magampura Port Management Company (MPMC) based on a professional screening process as per CMPorts standard global recruitment process. This was the same process followed by the investors when the QEQ berth at the Port of Colombo was privatised in 1999.
CMPort will utilize its expertise and experience as a leading global terminal operator and investor, and leverage on the success of its existing terminal (CICT) in the Colombo Port to ensure the success of Hambantota Port.
In doing so, CMPort plans to improve existing terminal facilities to world-class standards and transform Hambantota into an International Maritime Center.It will also combine the ports strategic location with CMPorts extensive carrier network to attract considerable traffic to and from the port.
Indirectly, areas surrounding the port will benefit from positive economic benefits such as job creation /human resource development and infrastructural development, both of which will contribute towards creating a favorable environment for potential investors and local industries. SLPA will be involved in all services that come under its authority as per the law.
National security shall be controlled by representatives of the Sri Lankan Navy and Police.
Even with an estimated 20% annual growth rate (very optimistic scenario) of operating profit, there is a considerable gap between profit and loan repayment in the next two decades.
In terms of liability, to date Hambantota Port Project has a total loan of US$1.35 billion. Out of that, US$ 0.9 billion loan is with 2% of interest rate and the balance of the loan is with an interest rate ranging from 6.3% to 7.65%.
In terms of financial performance in 2016, Hambantota Port (Phase I only) generates total revenue of US$11.81 million and incurs US$6.6 million of direct expenses and US$3.4 million of administrative expenses. All in all, Hambantota Port (Phase I only) has US$1.8 million of operating profit.
CMPort is one of the largest global terminal operators and investors in port and port-related facilities, listed on the Stock Exchange of Hong Kong with a market capitalisation of HK$53 billion.
CMPorts ports handled a total container throughput of 83.66 million TEUs in 2015, ranking second in the world according to Containerisation International.
CMPort has an extensive network of ports 55 terminals in 28 ports in 15 countries globally. CMPort also runs CICT in the Port of Colombo.

Fans barred from Aussie Open after flare-up
MELBOURNE: A group of fans was barred from the Australian Open on Monday after letting off flares nearby, recalling violent disturbances that have previously marred the Grand Slam tennis tournament.
Police said they will study CCTV footage and hope to bring charges after the group of 15-20 men let off a series of flares just metres (yards) from the venue in central Melbourne.
A group of about 15 to 20 males were walking along the side of the Yarra (river) ... and a couple of people in that group have let off some flares which is very dangerous behaviour, Inspector Trevor Cornwell said, according to the Herald Sun.
We're still ongoing with our investigations in regard to the males, we're reviewing some footage that we have, he added.
Footage online showed several flares burning in a riverside park near the Australian Open venue, which was packed with thousands of fans on day one.
Cornwell said some of the group were wearing national flags of a European country but that the incident was not race-related.
In extraordinary scenes for a tennis tournament, the Australian Open was marred by fighting involving ethnic Serbian, Croatian and Bosnian fans in 2007 and 2009.
Ahead of this year's event, police warned troublemakers would not be tolerated.

Fix your makeup this New Year
As festivals and weddings come to a close and night-long wild parties come for a brief halt, it's time to shake up and wash off the overloaded makeup-ed skin.
Now, allow your skin to breathe a natural fresh air! The key to natural, flawless glowing skin begins with a fantastic skin preparation. Skin does not look happy when it is dry, tired, cracked or oily.
Hence, according to Shikhee Agrawal, Head Training, The Body Shop, if you prepare the skin on your face correctly before you add your actual makeup, you will not need as much makeup to "fix" any given skin situation you might be faced with allowing an opportunity for your "natural, flawless glowing skin" to shine through.
Once the skin is properly prepped, apply your makeup as usual being mindful to go lighter on the foundation and powder. With a good skin prep you won't need to pile on the foundation, rather, it's more about spot checking the areas on your face that need help and then delicately dusting your translucent powder over those areas to set the makeup you have applied.
This will create a much more natural appearance to your skin before adding the final touches to the rest of your makeup look.
Product tips:
1. Use water based foundations enriched with rose water which would not only give coverage but will also work well on sensitive skin.
2. Wipe off makeup with cleanser or cleansing milk just apt for your skin type. Look out for cleansing solutions available in varying format: butter, lotion and water based .Go a little careful while removing your eye makeup.
3. Go for more natural and nude on eye makeup but pout your lips with on-trend shades of pink, plum and red.

When asked for his views the present president Anura de Silva said that he wants to contest for a second term to show that he can act independently without the support of Ranjith Rodrigo as several people had made allegations against him saying that he was under the influence of the former president Rodrigo.
De Silva said that he has rendered yeoman service to revive the football leagues despite spending a lot as legal fees due to several court cases. Former president Ranjith Rodrigo said that he is happy that there is a contest but the present president and the secretary should not use the resources of the Football Federation in their campaign. He denied the allegations made against him regarding interference in the affairs of the FFSL.
I hope to win again and serve the game to the best of my ability, Rodrigo said.

Government carrying out previous regimes agenda: Rathana Thera
The previous government made plans to give lands to China but could not implement it. It is regrettable however, to see that this government is implementing it and doing what the previous government was planning to do, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a media briefing at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday he said the former President cannot contest for the presidency again and cannot win an election.
The government should not over engage with China. According to Ven. Rathana Thera, now the past is behind us and terrorism is defeated, no matter who likes or hates it. It is not worth to imprison war heroes in order to obtain the GSP Plus. The UNP said it will implement a social market economy but now they are engaged in selling state assets without consulting anyone. Handing over Hambantota harbour to China on a 99 year lease is a serious crime. A National Policy Council should take the decision on what should be given to whom. Parts of the country cannot be handed over to foreign countries, he said.
The UNP should be focused on the colour of their party when taking decisions in connection with the development of the country. It is a huge mistake If we lose our environment in the name of development. We do not need to make another Singapore in Sri Lanka because Singapore is similar to the CMC in size and do not have water to drink. Instead of making Sri Lanka another Singapore, the Prime Minister should be focused on protecting the environment and promoting eco-tourism, said Rathana Thera.

Govt.will adhere to principles of good governance: President
President Maithripala Sirisena opted for a pragmatic approach to the concept and asked that his government do their best to adhere to principles of good governance amidst challenging circumstances.
When you take the current government, some people look at it and say Yahapalanaya with pride while some say it with ridicule, the President said. President Sirisena was speaking at the launching of the book Buddhist Ideals of Good Governance at Waters Edge, Battaramulla yesterday.
We all know that in Buddhism, we have the five precepts and the eight precepts and there are many Buddhists in this country and the world over. But, the problem is how many of these Buddhists by name live up to the true philosophy.
Many take up the five precepts but how many actually keep it,the President said.
This is similar to the concept of Yahpalanaya. How many truly live by the principles of Yahapalanaya. When you talk of the principles of good governance as prescribed by The
Buddha, at times, we think can we even pragmatically achieve one percent of that,the President asked.
Having completed two years in office, the people in this country now have some measure of how much of good governance the President, the Prime Minister and the ministers have adhered to.
To implement the concept of Good Governance in a society which has gone far beyond it is no easy task. To implement this within a society which functioned under politics, ways of thinking and alternative pathways to that of good governance is a challenge- similar to the keeping to the
five precepts, the President further explained.
The President added,The only solution we have is to do our best as we know how.
Ven.Dr.Tampalawela Dhammaratana Thera who is a co-author of the book also handed over a concept paper to establish an International Institute of Good Governance in Sri Lanka and
asked that the President make it a place to train future politicians and civil servants.
Good governance can be the best gift we can bestow from our Buddhist heritage this year. It should be the hand book that future leaders should follow, the Thera said.
The Buddha instructed many rulers without being a politician himself. The Buddha asked that they practice civilised human behaviour in politics thereby ratifying good governance policies and advocating righteous administration,Ven. Dr. Dhammaratana Thera said.
The other co-author of the book Prof.Francois Chenet stressed that with the future of politics predicted to be more unstable, it was necessary for leaders to ensure that societies are more open, equitable and transparent.
It is always the ruler that makes the age, he creates the environment for change,the Professor said.

It is not the United National Party but a group of SLFPers in the government who want to put off the local government election, UPFA parliamentarian Dilum Amunugama said.
He said that UNP wanted to hold the election as soon as possible but the SLFP group in the government was showing reluctance for fear of imminent defeat.
The Joint Opposition will increase their struggle to force the government to hold the local government election this year, irrespective of which party or faction will secure victory, he said.
He said the government had deprived the people of their democratic rights by postponing the local government election and people at the grass root level faced immense problems due to the postponement of the election.
Many local government institutions in the country have been brought under the supervision of special commissioners and secretaries. We will hold rallies and meetings to make the people aware of this situation, he said.

Heat is on as top seeds struggle
MELBOURNE, Monday: Top-ranked Andy Murray and Angelique Kerber fought their way into the second round as tournament favourites struggled in hot conditions on day one at the Australian Open on Monday.
As temperatures topped 32 Celsius (90 Fahrenheit), Murray came through a two hours, 47 minutes test against Ukraine`s Illya Marchenko 7-5, 7-6 (7/5), 6-2.
He fared better than women`s fourth seed Simona Halep, who was the tournament`s first major casualty, and Kei Nishikori and Marin Cilic, who were both taken to five sets.
Kerber, defending a Grand Slam title for the first time, laboured past Ukraine`s Lesia Tsurenko 6-2, 5-7, 6-2 in an unconvincing performance in the evening session.
But Australian tearaway Nick Kyrgios wowed his home fans as he demolished Portugal`s Gastao Elias 6-1, 6-2, 6-2, despite needing a medical timeout for a nose bleed.
Earlier, players draped themselves with towels packed with ice on a sweltering afternoon. Temperatures are set to rise further on Tuesday to a sizzling 38 Celsius.
I keep coming back to try, said Murray, who has lost a record five Australian Open finals without ever lifting the trophy.
I`ll keep doing that until I`m done. But I still feel like I got a few years left to try and do it. Hopefully it will be this year.
Kerber was an early loser at both of her warm-up tournaments and she took time to settle against Tsurenko. But the German also started slowly last year, when she had to save a match point against Misaki Doi in the first round.
The first round is always tough. I`m just trying to enjoy it and I`m so so happy to be in the second round, Kerber said.Halep is rated as the fastest player, male or female, over three metres but her usual zip was glaringly absent as she went down 6-3, 6-1 to American rising star Shelby Rogers.
Afterwards she said a knee injury had slowed her down as she succumbed in the first round for the second consecutive year. For 24-year-old Rogers, it was further proof of her potential after she reached last year`s French Open quarter-finals and rose nearly 100 places in the rankings last year.
Venus Williams, the oldest player in the women`s draw at 36, also found herself with a fight on her hands but she came through 7-6 (7/5), 7-5 against 22-year-old Kateryna Kozlova.
Girl, I don`t know, she told on-court interviewer Samantha Smith, who pointed out that Williams turned professional in 1994, the year that Kozlova was born.
I know how to play tennis. I like to think I`m good at this. She hasn`t had the years that I`ve had yet, the grey hairs and I`m dying, I guess. The wrinkles that I`m hiding... you`re trying to make me feel old!
Japan`s Nishikori, who says he is primed to win his first major title this year, came through a five-set battle with Russia`s Andrey Kuznetsov 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-2.
Cilic, the 2014 US Open winner, also needed five as he came from two sets down to dispatch Jerzy Janowicz 4-6, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2, 6-3.
China`s Zhang Shuai, who made a surprise run to last year`s quarter-finals, had an easier time with a 6-0, 6-3 win over Aliaksandra Sasnovich of Belarus.
Olympic champion Monica Puig stormed through 6-0, 6-1 against Patricia Tig and Jelena Jankovic, playing her 53rd consecutive Grand Slam, beat Laura Siegemund 6-1, 1-6, 6-4.
Federer makes winning return
Roger Federer made a winning return to competitive tennis after six months out of the game on Monday, thrilling a packed Rod Laver Arena as he beat qualifier Juergen Melzer 7-5 3-6 6-2 6-2 to reach the Australian Open second round.
The 35-year-old Swiss had to battle hard throughout the two-hour, six minute contest and only really eased clear of his dogged opponent when the Austrian tired in the final set.
Federer could be forgiven a little rustiness after his prolonged absence to nurse a knee injury and made 36 unforced errors but there were also plenty of reminders of the brilliant skills that have won him 17 grand slam titles, four at Melbourne Park.
Seeded 17th, Federer has much tougher battles ahead if he makes it through to the second week of the tournament but will next pit his skills against American qualifier Noah Rubin.  Agencies

Immediate relief for drought affected farmer families: Duminda
Agriculture development programmes scheduled for the Maha season in the Anuradhapura District had been cancelled due to the prevailing drought.
President Mithripala Sirisena has instructed to relevant authorities to give maximum relief for the affected families and to launch a programme to excavate the tanks in the Anuradhapura district deeper by removing sediments and to take steps to provide farmers with drinking water, Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said at the Anuradhapura district coordinating committee meeting in the Anuradhapura Provincial Council Auditorium.
The meeting was convened to make plans to provide relief for the drought affected people in the district.
The drought has severely affected around 1,50,000 farmer families. Although 1,30,000 hectares of paddy lands were to be cultivated, the prevailing drought conditions had hindered the initial plans. About 40,000 hectares of cultivated lands now face inevitable destruction due to the drought. The meeting focused specifically on providing relief to the affected farmer families.
About 20,000 wells on cultivated lands are now abandoned. The decision was made at the meeting to take immediate steps to rehabilitate these wells. The minister said the President had instructed wildlife and forest conservation authorities to release lands to the landless farmers. Since a large number of deep drinking wells were not used, they shall be renovated so as to provide suitable drinking water for farmer families.
North Central Water Supply and Drainage Board Assistant General Manager said three major reservoirs of Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks hold only a water capacity of 10,000, 1,405 and 5,750 acre.fts respectively. The water available at present is sufficient for only two months ahead.
He requested the political authority and the district coordinating committee to make the Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee to issue in this month 3,000 acre ft of Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa, 2,000 acre ft to Thuruwila and 1,000 acre ft to Thissawewa to avoid a water restriction.
The Anuradhapura district has 4,500 hand operating tube wells, he said. Of them, 1,500 wells are not functioning and they need immediate repairs. He said 500 million rupees should be released to revive at least 500 such tube wells.

India must rethink opposition to Chinese investment in Sri Lanka: Chinese media
BEIJING: India should rethink its opposition to Chinese investments in Sri Lanka and join the port development in the island nation instead of feeling jealous, Chinas state media said yesterday.
It is understandable that the cooperation has left some Asian countries vigilant as media reports suggest that an 80 per cent share of the port, which sits on an important trade route, and land for an industrial zone will be leased to China for the next 99 years, an article in Global Times referring to Sri Lankas decision to hand over the Hambatota Port to China.
Also there was public agitation over the land given to China to industrial zone in Hambatota.
However, joining the project would be better than standing aside and being jealous, the article said.
As more and more South Asian countries keep a positive attitude toward Chinas efforts to improve infrastructure in the region, skeptics in countries such as India should rethink their stance toward the Chinese-funded project in Sri Lanka, it said.
China is likely to adopt an open attitude if other countries can put aside the idea of geopolitical confrontation and join in on harbour construction of the island nation, it said.
Referring to concerns in India and Japan over Chinese investments totalling over USD 8 billion, the article said, the Chinese-funded project in Sri Lanka is not a nail being knocked into the geopolitical landscape of South Asia to curb Indias rise.
Chinas economic cooperation with Sri Lanka does not target any third party, including India and Japan, because the project is just another move in pushing forward the Belt and Road initiative, an open, inclusive international cooperative proposal that any nation is welcome to take part in, it said.
India and Japan should feel free to join the initiative in a bid to boost their presence in Sri Lankas economy, but it is questionable whether the two countries are willing to spend a large amount of money on supporting the economy of Sri Lanka and pushing forward regional economic integration, it said.
If Sri Lanka could not get enough financial support from India and Japan to build its port facilities, it seems inadvisable to prevent the South Asian country from seeking help from China, a country that is witnessing a boom in outbound investment, it said.
Some countries like India and Bangladesh will be the first batch of beneficiaries of Chinas efforts to build a network of roads and infrastructure facilities in South Asia to open up new trade routes. In this regard, Chinas economic cooperation with Sri Lanka will contribute not just to the local economy but to the whole region, it said. (The Economic Times India)

Indian economy to remain strong in 2017, despite short-term impact of demonetisation
Moody's Investors Service and its Indian affiliate, ICRA Limited, say that India will remain one of the fastest growing major economies globally in 2017, although GDP growth will moderate in the first half of the year, as the economy adjusts after demonetisation
Moody's also believes that the government will likely achieve its fiscal deficit target of 3.5% of GDP for the current fiscal year ending March 31, 2017.
ICRA expects the country's growth of gross value added at basic prices to remain healthy in 2017, although such growth will ease somewhat to about 6.6% from around 7.0% in 2016, with a likely pick-up in H2 2017.
"Even after the currency in circulation is replenished, we expect that India's economic growth will stabilize with a lag, while remaining strong," says Aditi Nayar, an ICRA Principal Economist. "The adjustment and recovery period could stretch to as much as 2-3 quarters for certain sectors."
ICRA says that the focus on digital transactions and the introduction of a goods and services tax (GST) will likely reduce the competitiveness of the unorganised sector. ICRA therefore anticipates a relatively healthier expansion of the organised sectors in 2017, at the cost of the unorganised sectors.
ICRA also says that the loss of incomes in some sectors and deferral of consumption are likely to weigh on capacity utilization, delaying the capacity expansion plans of the private sector. And, the extent of capital spending budgeted by the central and state governments for the fiscal year ending 31 March 2018 will affect the extent to which infrastructure spending can stimulate growth in a non-inflationary manner.
"Nevertheless, economic and institutional reforms already introduced and potentially forthcoming, continue to offer a reasonable expectation that India's growth will outperform that of its similarly rated peers over the medium term, and that the country will achieve further improvements in its macroeconomic and institutional profile," says William Foster, a Moody's Vice President and Senior Credit Officer.

Injury-hit Muguruza battles into second round
MELBOURNE: Big-hitting Spaniard Garbine Muguruza struggled with injury as she battled into the Australian Open second round Monday with a straight-sets win over New Zealands Marina Erakovic.
The French Open champion, seeded seven, needed a medical time-out after the first set for what appeared to be a foot problem before returning to win 7-5, 6-4 on Margaret Court Arena.
It was very tough when youre playing and starting to feel pain, she said afterwards.
I tried to just stay calm and fight for the match. Its always tough against Marina and Im very happy because its the first major of the year and youre always a bit nervous. Muguruza announced her arrival as a major force with her shock straight-sets victory over Serena Williams in last years Roland Garros final, but consistency has been elusive.
She is yet to go beyond the fourth round at Melbourne Park but said ahead of the tournament she was learning to manage the pressure, and she had a good workout against Erakovic, ranked 110th.
Muguruza used her powerful groundstrokes to grind down the Kiwi as they exchanged service breaks in the opening set before the Spaniard took charge and broke again in the 11th game.
The 23-year-old, who opened her season with a run to the Brisbane International semi-finals before retiring with a right thigh injury, was broken early in the second set before knuckling down to romp to victory. She will next play American Samantha Crawford, who beat compatriot Lauren Davis 4-6, 6-3, 6-0. AFP

Kane century fires New Zealand to stunning win
WELLINGTON: Captain Kane Williamson scored his 15th century as New Zealand staged a remarkable fightback to win the first Test against Bangladesh by seven wickets in the final session in Wellington on Monday.
Williamson and Ross Taylor, determined not to run out of time, batted at more than 6.0 an over in their 163-run third wicket partnership with New Zealand chasing down a 217-run target.
The New Zealand skipper finished unbeaten on 104 with Taylor out for 60 and Henry Nicholls not out four.
Bangladesh were in command for nearly four days, until their second innings lasted less than 58 overs to end at 160-9 and captain Mushfiqur Rahim in hospital after being felled by a Tim Southee bouncer.
It was a disappointing sequel to their imposing first innings of 595-8 declared, presenting them with the unwanted record of the highest ever score in the first innings to lose a Test.
The previous mark was set more than 120 years ago, when Australia scored 586 against England at the Sydney cricket ground in 1894.
New Zealand made a shaky start to their run chase with first innings centurion Tom Latham out for 16 and fellow opener Jeet Raval for 13, both removed by off-spinner Mehedi Hasan in the space of eight balls.
But Williamson and Taylor were unruffled on a warm Wellington afternoon that was a far cry from the blustery first day when Bangladesh batted positively on a green wicket.
Williamson brought up his century -- levelling the scores with a sweep off Mehedi to the boundary -- before ending the game with a single off the next ball.
Bangladesh resumed the final day at 66-3 and were in early trouble when Shakib Al Hasan, whose 217 in the first innings is a record high score for a Bangladesh batsman, lasted only five balls before going for a duck.
Mominul Haque, who has two centuries to his name in five previous innings against New Zealand, was removed this time for 23.
At 96-5, Sabbir Rahman and Mushfiqur added 18 runs in 16 overs in the face of a torrid attack from the New Zealand pace trio of Southee, Trent Boult and Neil Wagner.
Mushfiqur, who had been unable to field for Bangladesh during New Zealand's first innings 539, was forced to duck repeatedly under a barrage of bouncers until a ball hit the back of his helmet.
He lay prone on the wicket, attended by medical staff from both teams until an ambulance drove on to the field and took him to hospital. He was later given the all-clear.
Opener Imrul Kayes, who was stretchered off and taken to hospital late on the fourth day with a hip injury, hobbled to the crease at the fall of the seventh wicket.
Unable to run, he relied on boundaries to be 36 not out when the innings ended.
Boult finished with three for 53 while Wagner and spinner Mitchell Santner took two wickets each.
The second Test starts in Christchurch Friday.

Kohli, Jadhav centuries help India beat England
Pune: Skipper Virat Kohli and Kedar Jadhav hit blistering centuries to help India chase down 350 and stun England by three wickets in the first one-day international in Pune on Sunday.
Kohli (122), who was leading the limited overs side for the first time, and Jadhav (120) put on 200 runs for the fifth wicket as India achieved the target with 11 balls to spare.
Allrounder Hardik Pandya kept his nerves to take India home with his unbeaten 40 off 37 deliveries. Ravichandran Ashwin (15 not out) hit a six to finish off the match in style.
Earlier put into bat, England posted their highest-ever ODI total against the hosts in India, 350-7, with Jason Roy (73), Joe Root (78) and Ben Stokes (62) scoring half-centuries.
In their reply India were tottering at 63 for four when Kohli and man of the match Jadhav combined forces for a blazing counter attack that caught the Eoin Morgan-led side unawares. At 60 for 4, yes I was still thinking win. The moment I saw Kedar hitting the ball well, I told him lets get to 150 for 4, and they are going to hit the panic button, said Kohli.
The only way we could have come out of this was to counter attack. We couldnt win with those singles. We needed to tell the opposition that we believe we can win.
Yuvraj Singh (15), who returned to the ODI team after a three-year gap, and Mahendra Singh Dhoni (6), playing his first match after relinquishing his limited overs captaincy, failed to fire.
But the 28-year-old skipper lived up to his epithet of King Kohli as he smashed 8 fours and 5 sixes during his 105-ball stay at the crease.
The star batsman, who brought up his 27th ODI hundred with a six off Chris Woakes, batted with purpose to bring alive a capacity crowd at the Maharashtra Cricket Association stadium.
However, it was the lesser known Jadhav, who was the aggressor in the partnership, putting the England attack to the sword. Local boy Jadhav, who recorded his second ODI ton in just his 13th game, hit 12 fours and 4 sixes in his 76-ball knock. AFP

La La Land musical set to rock the Baftas
Hollywood musical La La Land is set to steal the show at the Baftas. The Damien Chazelle film has been nominated for 11 awards, just days after winning seven Golden Globes. The American romance follows a musician and aspiring actress who met and fall in love in LA. The two face a battle of juggling once-in-a-lifetime love and being in the spotlight.
The film features Ryan Gosling, Emma Stone, Tom Everett Scott, Finn Wittrock, J.K Simmons, Rosemarie DeWitt and John Legend. Both Gosling and Stone have been nominated for awards at the Baftas. According to Oddschecker, Gosling is 7/2 to win Best Actor whereas co-star Stone is 8/15 to win Best Actress, giving her a 65.2% of winning the award. La La Land looks set to win Best Picture at 1/4, and Damien Chazelle is even more likely to claim Best Director at 1/6.
Following the recent success of La La Land at the Golden Globes, odds for the film to pick up an Oscar for Best Picture have shortened dramatically and the odds are expected to become even shorter following another successful night at the Baftas. The Barry Jenkins film Moonlight appears to be La La Lands main competition for Best Picture. Moonlight showcases the struggle of a young man growing up in a rough neighbourhood in Miami. The drama has already won a Golden Globe for Best Motion Picture  Drama, and is 7/1 to win Best Picture at the Baftas.
Casey Affleck is set to put a dampener on Ryan Goslings evening. Affleck is as short as 1/5 to win Best Actor and is also a short favourite to take home the same award at the Oscars. La La Land have had no nominations for either Best Supporting Actress or Actor with Viola Davis role in Fences as short as 1/10 to win best supporting actress, while Mahershala Ali (Moonlight) and Aaron Taylor-Johnson (Nocturnal Animals) will battle it out for Best Supporting Actor.
The ceremony will be held at the Royal Albert Hall in London on 12 February.

Let court decide WWs case
A big ha ho is being made these days over the arrest and remanding of National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa, with even demonstrations being planned by the Joint Opposition. Weerawansa was arrested on a court order, obviously after a thorough examination of his case by the judge. The JO, as is its wont, has seized on this opportunity to gain maximum political mileage and has even gone to the extent of challenging the court order.
It is indeed strange that not much noise was made by the Joint Opposition following the arrest and remanding of Yoshitha and Namal Rajapaksa on the more serious felon of money laundering. Is the JO then conceding that there is sufficient material for the arrest of the junior Rajapaksas and that this was not the case in respect of Wimal Weerawansa Ditto for the likes of Jonston Fernando, Mahindananda Aluthgamage et al.
In the eyes of the JO, they are indeed guilty and not so Wimal. If not, how can one explain the lukewarm response to their arrests compared to what we see now in respect of WW. Is it because the JO is today badly missing the anti minority tirades of Weerawansa
We are not here passing judgement on WW. He is only in remand custody. He may, or may not be guilty in respect of the charges brought against him. This is entirely a matter for the court to decide. But what cannot be condoned is the challenge mounted against a court order by JHO stalwarts, among whom are leading lawyers.
Not long ago we saw the ugly spectacle of a court being lain siege to by a mob, led by persons in saffron. This was their way of showing contempt for a court order. Is this now going to extend to the countrys lawmakers, no less, who should know better Weerawansa is only one among many languishing behind bars. What about the others placed in the same predicament but have not the power or influence to mobilize support of the kind commanded by WW
There is also another dimension to the whole affair. Attempts are being made to rope in others, who are said to be complicit in the offence for which Weerawansa has been accused of. One of them, Deputy Minister to WW at the time, Lasantha Alagiyawanna, while admitting to using Ministry vehicles, is on record saying that these vehicles were used solely relating to development purposes and obtained following the laid down procedure while then Chairman of the State Engineering Corporation Ashu Marasinghe says that he had already given statements to the FCID. He is being accused by the Weerawansa front for following up on WWs orders and issuing directions for the release of the vehicles but the police letting him off.
As has already been observed in an editorial of an English weekly, a Minister is the lord of all he surveys in his domain and it is unthinkable that his orders can be countermanded by his subordinates, short of being thrown out on a limb. This truism has held under all governments since independence and this government is no exception, although there had been officials, along the way, who had stood up to irregular and illegal orders issued by the Minister, as pointed by the editorial, and left with their heads held high. Knowing Weerawansa, who is used to having his way, as demonstrated by his getting then Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa evict the policemen guarding the UN compound in Colombo so that he (Weerawansa) and his mob could do as they please (the scene went viral on Social Media), it is doubtful that any official would have had the mettle to go against his minister.
The bone of contention here is the 40 vehicles requisitioned by WW from the SEC had been placed at the disposal of his relatives, members of NFF, clergy and journalists, among others. It is obvious that these personages could not have used these vehicles for facilitating development or supervising projects. It is difficult to comprehend that any of these persons could have had the knowledge or aptitude for such tasks, particularly the relatives of WW and members of the Sangha.
Hence it is reasonable to assume that the 40 vehicles, said to have been hired at a cost of Rs. 90 million to the state, had been used for purposes other than that related to the ministry and most probably used for political work, particularly that connected to WW in the Colombo district.
Be that as it may, staging protests, openly challenging court orders, have become a recent trend in this country. We saw this in Hambantota the other day. If allowed to continue unchecked, it may lead to a serious situation where the laws supremacy itself will come to be challenged.
Drastic action should be taken, if things are not to deteriorate further. Open defiance of court orders should not be permitted at any cost. If need be, laws should be introduced to deal severely with protest leaders who act against a court order.

Lindsay Lohan fuels speculation she has converted to Islam

Lindsay Lohan has deleted all her posts and photos from Instagram and replaced them with an Arabic message, fuelling speculation she has converted to Islam.
The Mean Girls star wrote "Alaikum Salam" on her Instagram bio - meaning "and unto you peace".
The 30-year-old's social media account is followed by 5.7 million people, with many commenting on her apparent conversion.
I heard that Lindsay Lohan converted to Islam" one user wrote. "If its true, alhamdulillah. God has shown her the right path to now follow."
Posts on Lohan's Twitter account have also apparently been erased, with the page showing only her bio.
One of the star's followers posted photos of Lohan wearing a hijab during a visit to Turkey in October, writing: "May Allah bless you."
The actress penned a poem about the refugee crisis after her visit to Turkey.
"Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most / but in this world we live in of terror," it reads.
"There has to be something I can figure out / rather than living in a world of fear and doubt / they now shoot, we used to shout / if only I can keep trying to fix it all."
Lohan first prompted rumours of Islamic beliefs in 2015, when she was photographed holding a copy of the Koran while doing community work.
We all believe in something and at the end of the day it all ties to a god or a spiritual adviser, she said at the time.
Before turning to philanthropy, Lohan had been in and out of rehab for cocaine and alcohol abuse.

Mahindra to jazz up SUV variants as competition hots up
Mahindra & Mahindra is trying to make two of its popular vehicles more appealing to the buyer, as competition is set to intensify further in the SUV space with rivals Maruti SuzukiBSE -0.22 % and Tata Motors launching new models.
M&M has readied new variants of the XUV 500 and KUV 100 to hold on to its share in the segment that is growing fast and where it has been upstaged by Maruti in some months of 2016 on the back of strong demand for the Vitara Breeza. The Ignis from Maruti and the Tata Hexa are set to pose fresh threat to the company.
The changes will be in aesthetics and features, and there will be no major price increase.
Pravin Shah, chief executive for the automotive sector at Mahindra & Mahindra, told ET that the philosophy of Mahindra always was to offer value of Rs 100 at Rs 50.
The company is adding a host of connectivity technologies to make the XUV more feature-packed. The new EcoSense telematics feature will allow real-time tracking of the vehicle, including fuel economy and wear and tear of parts. Mood lighting is another addition on offer.
The company has also added a safety button in the XUV, which will be triggered in the event of any accident and call the stored emergency contact number. It will offer this feature to existing XUV owners as well, through a small software upgrade.
In the Rs 15-25 lakh premium SUV space, M&M already sells 3,000-3,500 XUVs a month, more than all models of other companies put together. In the micro SUV space, where the company is facing maximum heat, M&M is upgrading the KUV by improving the aesthetics of the car and its fuel economy.
In the coming few weeks, the new KUV variant will come with dual colours for the first time to keep itself competitive against the Maruti Ignis. The KUV will also offer the options of bigger alloy wheels and a host of accessories.
The world is embracing digital technologies, while increasing traffic on the road is making people spend more time in cars, Shah said. With connected features, we are trying to offer options which take away torture and fatigue, by making them more gainfully deployed, be it mood lighting or connectivity features.
Mahindra has already tied up with Google and has integrated the Android Auto operating system on the infotainment system of the XUV and is in discussion with Apple to integrate the Apple CarPlay.

Man takes own life after strangling daughter
The body of a man who had disappeared from his home in Eriyagama Tambuttegama after throttling his 12-year-old daughter from the first marriage and thrown her into a forest leaving her for die, was found below the flight of steps leading up to the Wessagiri cave in the Anuradhapura Sacred City.
The body was found by Anuradhapura Police Emergency Response Unit in the wee hours of yesterday. The suspect had been absconding for five days fearing arrest for the ill treatment caused to his 12-year-daughter from the first marriage.
A letter written to his second wife admitting that he committed suicide by drinking poison was also found near the body by police.
Police said investigations revealed that the man had taken the daughter along with him to the Maradagala teak forest to tether his cattle for grazing. Inside the forest, he had squeezed the girls neck until she fell unconscious and left thinking she had died.
The girl had regained consciousness later and shouted in pain when villagers rushed to the aid and hospitalised her.
The mans second wife arrived at the spot and identified the body as that of her husband. The post mortem was due to be held at the Anuradhapura Hospital.

MH370: Underwater search called off

The search for missingMalaysia Airlines flight MH370has come to an end with passengers families being informed that the effort to find the plane has been suspended.
Next of kin were told in an emailed statement on Tuesday that Australian authorities underwater search of 120,000 sq km in the southern Indian Ocean had concluded without success.
The search had been ongoing for more than two years.
The MH370 Tripartite Joint Communiqu seen by the Guardian was co-signed by the transport ministers of Malaysia, China and Australia, representing the three countries involved in the search. It was made public at 2pmMalaysiatime.
Today the last search vessel has left the underwater search area.Malaysia Airlines flight MH370has not been located in the 120,000 square-kilometre underwater search area in the southern Indian Ocean, it read.
Despite every effort using the best science available, cutting edge technology, as well as modelling and advice from highly skilled professionals who are the best in their field, unfortunately, the search has not been able to locate the aircraft.
The decision to suspend the underwater search has not been taken lightly nor without sadness.
Flight MH370 disappeared on March 8, 2014, vanishing from radar shortly after take-off from Kuala Lumpar en route to Beijing. The plane is believed to have crashed in the Indian Ocean, claiming the lives of all 239 crew and passengers on board.
The announcement comes six weeks out from the third anniversary of the planes disappearance, with the underwater search effort led by the Australian Transport Safety Bureau in the so-called seventh arc since October 2014 concluding without success.
At a tripartite meeting in July 2016, the three transport ministers hadacknowledged the diminishing likelihood of finding the plane. If the full 120,000 sq km area was searched without success, the effort was to not end, but be suspended indefinitely, they said  reiterating the earlier resolution made in April 2015.
In December,the ATSB saidthey had a high degree of confidence that the wreck would not be found in the tranche of Indian ocean originally pinpointed, instead highlighting a new area of approximately 25,000 sq km  between latitudes 33 degrees south and 36 degrees south  as the area with the highest probability of containing the wreckage of the aircraft.
The tripartite statement said Tuesdays announcement was consistent with its decision made in July 2016.
Whilst combined scientific studies have continued to refine areas of probability, to date no new information has been discovered to determine the specific location of the aircraft.
The flight was carrying 152 Chinese nationals and 50 from Malaysia, as well as passengers from Australia, Canada, France, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Iran, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Russia, Taiwan, Ukraine and the United States
Chandrika Sharma, of Chennai in India, was among the 239 people on board MH370.
This decision appears premeditated and a betrayal of the commitment to the families and the public that the governments are committed to the search, K S Narendran, her husband of 25 years, told the Guardian.
It must also come as a blow to all this who have worked tirelessly to find answers and find the plane.
A series of pingsfrom what was believedto be one of the black boxes from the plane initially narrowed the search zone to a smaller region of the Indian Ocean. Australias then prime minister Tony Abbott and Malaysian transport minister Hishammuddin Husseinboth suggested the plane was close to discoveryweeks after the crash.
But the hunt for the plane quickly became one of the worlds greatest aviation mysteriesafter a lengthy aerial searchyielded no results.
Following the exhaustive aerial survey, the search for the missing planehad a fourth-month hiatuswhile experts mapped the part of the ocean where the plane was believed to have crashed.
In October 2014 the Australian Transport Safety Bureau began a new phase for the search for MH370, an underwater search effort of 120,000 sq km of the Indian ocean floor.
The search has been a multimillion-dollar effort on the parts of Australia, Malaysia and China. The operation is believed to have cost around AU$180m, paid for by Australia and Malaysia.Chinadonated AU$20m in funding and equipment.
Progress was frustrated by difficulties in reaching the search zone and the largely uncharted part of the Indian Ocean it was believed to have crashed in. The final 20,000 sq km in particular were delayed by poor weather conditions throughout 2016.
But investigators remained optimistic, with Martin Dolan, the head of the ATSB,expressing confidencein March 2016, the two-year anniversary of its disappearance, that the plane would be found within that 120,000 sq km area.
In July 2015 authorities had a breakthrough in the search, when they found debris on the island of Runion that waslater confirmed to be a flaperon from the flight.
Several more pieces of debris were confirmed to have come from MH370, including a wing flap found on an island off the coast of Tanzania in June and sent to Canberra for analysisthat was found to be from a Boeing 777.
Investigators say the failure to find the wreckage does not mean all search efforts will end. But those seeking answers for the disappearance of the plane  and those on board  now face the prospect that the fate of MH370 might never be known.

Mouse plague possible in Australia

Australia's science agency has warned that spring rains have created ideal conditions for a mouse plague in the country's breadbasket.
Victoria and South Australia are experiencing higher than expected numbers of mice, the CSIRO said.
The agency characterises a mouse plague as more than 1,000 mice per hectare (405 per acre).
If conditions bring enough food, the population could hit that number within months, researcher Steve Henry said.
We had a terrific spring this year which lead to record crops, Henry told the BBC.
Those conditions that lead to great crops are also really favourable for mice.
The CSIRO could not give a current figure for mice per hectare, but said data from traps and anecdotal evidence pointed to a population spike. About five mice per hectare would be considered normal, Henry said.
Mouse plagues regularly occur only in Australia's grain belts and a province in north-west China, the CSIRO said.
Threat to farms
Victoria and South Australia occupy a large part of the Murray-Darling Basin, a fertile region accounting for almost 40% of Australia's agricultural income, according to the government.
Outbreaks of mice create a significant financial hit to farmers who are forced to buy costly bait and often re-sow crops.
Henry said outbreaks also led to stress in rural communities.
It's the fact that they are invading people's houses, they're in their vehicles, everywhere they turn around there's a mouse, he said.
People in the cities are aghast when they have a mouse in the house. These people in the country, they're jamming up every crack in their house with steel wool to stop the mice from getting in.
Mice were introduced to Australia by European settlers. They have few natural predators and face little competition from native wildlife.

Former Minister Prof. G.L. Peiris yesterday said that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa could have secured the GSP+ facility, if he had agreed to the conditions laid down by the European Union at the risk of countrys sovereignty.
He said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is talking about the regaining of this facility to Sri Lanka, but no a single word uttered about the conditions laid down by the EU to grant this facility to Sri Lanka.
The former Minister said the government has to comply with 58 conditions laid down by the EU to restore this facility to Sri Lanka. These conditions include the repealing of the Prevention of Terrorism Act too, he said.
He said former President Rajapaksa rejected to accept these conditions which would put the country at risk. We can not pawn the country for the sake of economic growth, Prof. Peiris said.

NATO obsolete, says Trump
GERMANY: President-elect Donald Trump, in remarks published on Sunday, described NATO as obsolete and suggested a deal with Russia that would reduce nuclear arsenals and ease sanctions on Moscow.
He also hailed Britains exit from the EU and backed a speedy trade deal with the UK, but condemned as catastrophic Chancellor Angela Merkels decision to open Germanys doors to a flood of refugees.
I said a long time ago that NATO had problems, Trump told The Times of London and Bild, Germanys biggest-selling daily.
Number one, it was obsolete, because it was designed many, many years ago, he said.
Number two, the countries arent paying what theyre supposed to pay. I took such heat, when I said NATO was obsolete. Its obsolete because it wasnt taking care of terror. I took a lot of heat for two days. And then they started saying Trump is right. He added, though, NATO is very important to me. On the campaign trail, Trump said he would think twice about helping NATO allies if the United States were not reasonably reimbursed for the costs of defending them.
His comments caused consternation among eastern European NATO countries nervous about Moscow following Russias annexation of Crimea and involvement in the conflict in Ukraine.
After Trumps victory, NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said the alliance had been a bedrock of transatlantic security for almost 70 years and was especially needed at a time of new challenges.
This is no time to question the partnership between Europe and the United States, Stoltenberg said.
Spending has been a common source of friction within the 28-nation alliance over recent years.
The core military contributor to the alliance is the United States, which accounts for about 70 percent of spending.
In 2014, stung into action by Russias intervention in Ukraine, upheaval in the Middle East and North Africa, NATO leaders agreed to reverse years of defence cuts and devote the equivalent of two percent of economic output to defence. The countries arent paying their fair share so were supposed to protect countries, Trump said in Sundays interview. Theres five countries that are paying what theyre supposed to. Five. Its not much.
In other remarks carried by The Times, Trump suggested cutting a deal with Russia in which nuclear arsenals would be reduced and sanctions against Moscow would be eased.
They have sanctions on Russia -- lets see if we can make some good deals with Russia. I think nuclear weapons should be way down and reduced very substantially, thats part of it, Trump said.

NCE welcomes EU proposal to restore GSP+ facility
The National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka (NCE) has commended the Government on its success in regaining the GSP+ facility, to boost exports from Sri Lanka
The NCE notes with great satisfaction the success of the Government in regaining the GSP+ facility, which will undoubtedly boost the stagnating trend of Sri Lankan Exports to facilitate accelerated Economic Development through the achievement of ambitious National Export Targets.
The European Commission which is the Executive body of the European Union (EU) has proposed to restore the special concessions for imports from Sri Lanka under the GSP+ Facility, in exchange for the improved human rights and labor record of the country, subject to ratification by the European Parliament, which will be accompanied by a rigorous monitoring of human rights, good governance, labour conditions, protection of the environment, and rule of law, in conformity with the concerned 27 International Conventions.
The Chamber is pleased to note that the GSP+ Preference would entail the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide range of products including Textiles and Garments, Fisheries Products, Rubber Products, and Machinery.
Since the EU consisting of 27 countries is the biggest export market for Sri Lanka accounting for 1/3 of total global exports of the country, the concessions can make a significant contribution to Sri Lanka's economic development by increasing exports to the EU market especially by the apparel sector which accounts for 46% of Sri Lanka's Exports. In 2015 EU imports from Sri Lanka amounted to 2.6 Billion Euros which highlights the significance of the concessions that will be available.
Currently there are Eight GSP+ beneficiaries among developing countries. In this context the chamber notes that Sri Lanka will have a particular advantage over competitor countries such as Pakistan, Bangladesh, and the Philippines for exportse specially in the textiles and garments sector.
The Chamber urges its members and other Sri Lankan exporters to prepare themselves during this period to make effective use of the concessions that will be available.
The Chamber on its part will conduct awareness creating training programs for Sri Lankan exporters, and for its member companies, to have a clear understanding of the regulations and procedures, as well as product quality requirements of the EU countries to effectively compete in the EU market, using the advantage of the concessions that will become available.

New Honda City unveiled
While the SUV/Crossover craze is still growing in the Indian automotive market, the Honda City had been the consumer favourite in its segment for a long time. But with competitors like the Maruti Suzuki Ciaz (also getting a facelift later this year), the revised Skoda Rapid and the Volkswagen Vento catching up, Honda felt the City could do with a mid-life facelift and evoke buyer interest.
The new City gets some very obvious cosmetic updates, with the chrome band running across the grille and the nose and chin looks more like the latest generation of the Civic. The front bumper has more prominent sections for the air dam and the housings for the fog lamps, with a restyled grille as well. It looks the same as the current model in side profile, though. The headlights now house LED daytime running lamps, while the tail-lamps have also been slightly tweaked. It also gets sporty new 16inch alloys, though thats probably only in the top trim.
Mechanically, Honda has made no changes to the City which will still be powered by the same old 1.5-litre petrol and 1.5-litre diesel engines, but there is a minor update to the suspension compared to the current model. Features like ABS and dual airbags will come as standard, while the major equipment upgrade would be the new infotainment system with Android Auto. Top-of-the-line variants will get leather seats and a soft-touch dashboard. There are also reports of the ZX-badged variant being reintroduced in the Indian market.
While prices for the current City start from Rs 8.8 lakh (ex-showroom, Mumbai), expect Honda to charge a slight premium for the revised models.

Nishikori survives five-set dogfight to advance
MELBOURNE: Japans big hope Kei Nishikori survived a gruelling five-set examination in the first round to advance in scorching conditions at the Australian Open on Monday.
The fifth seeded Nishikori came through a dogfight with 48th-ranked Russian Andrey Kuznetsov to win 5-7, 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-2 in 3hr 34min and maintain his unbeaten record in five-set matches in Melbourne.
It was Nishikoris fourth five-set win at the Australian Open, and set him up for a second-round encounter with Frenchman Jeremy Chardy.
It wasnt easy, especially mentally and I should have finished it in four sets, Nishikori said.
I was more relaxed and really focused in the fifth set and Im really happy to get through the first round. Kuznetsov had Nishikori in trouble in the opening set, breaking him twice before serving out the set with his third set point.
But the Japanese star found his groove in the second set, reeling off a double break to level the set scores in 30 minutes. Kuznetsov wouldnt lie down and got an early break in the third set in rising temperatures on Hisense Arena, but Nishikori quickly broke back. Nishikori applied bags of ice to the back of his neck during the changeovers. Nishikori took command in the third set after Kuznetsov began to show the effects of the battle, noticeably limping between points.
But the Russian refused to give in and fought back from 2-5 down in a tiebreaker to take the gruelling match into a fifth set. Nishikori came home strongly in the final set, grabbing an early break and rounding it off when Kuznetsov double-faulted on the second match point. AFP

In her previous outings, Badlapur and Sanam Re, the actress character dies in the course of the plot. In Kaabils trailer, as well, it becomes obvious that she get brutally murdered, sending Hrithik on a spree of venge ance.
How ever, when we caught up with the actress recently during the films promotions, she dropped hints that all may not be as it seems. When asked how she feels about her character dying in every film, she laughed and replied, How can you be sure that I will die in this film I understand that people make their opinions after seeing the trailers, but these assumptions are not fair. People should actually watch the film and not just comment based on guesses.
Directed by Sanjay Gupta, Kaabils curtain raiser showed Hrithik in an intense avatar. Also starring brothers Ronit Roy and Rohit Roy in the pivotal roles, the film is set to clash with Shah Rukh Khans much awaited Raees on January 25. Deccan Chronicle

Pakistan: Woman sentenced to death for burning daughter alive

A woman in Pakistan has been sentenced to death for burning her daughter alive in a so-called "honor killing" incident.
Parveen Bibi told a court in Lahore, Punjab that she killed her daughter "for bringing shame to her family," police spokeswoman Nabila Ghazanfar told CNN Tuesday.
Parveen's son Ahmer Rafique was sentenced to life in prison for his role in the crime.
Brutal killing
Zeenat Rafique, 18, was strangled and set alight by her mother and brother in June 2016 after she eloped against their wishes.
Rafique had been living with her new husband for a month before she visited her home in Lahore in the hopes of reconciliation with her family.
But when Rafique arrived, her mother and brother tied her to a bed, poured gasoline and set her on fire, police said.
Parveen then turned herself over to the authorities but expressed no sorrow for actions.
Undernew anti-"honor killing" laws that took effect in October, neither Parveen or her son will be eligible for pardon even if another family member forgives them for the crime.
Previously, murderers were able to walk free in many instances, creating what critics characterized as a culture of impunity. Now, a killer will face a minimum sentence of 25 years in jail.
The law's passage came after a series of high-profile incidents, including themurder of social media star Qandeel Balochby her brother, who later said he was "proud" of his actions.
According to the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan,almost 300 women were victims of such killings in the first half of 2016. In a 2015 report by the World Economic Forum, Pakistanranked 144 out of 145countries on gender disparity.

Pollution by pilgrims drastically reduced in Sri Pada this season
Bringing non degradable items such as plastics, polythene wrappings, bags and other material by pilgrims visiting Sri Pada has decreased by almost 40 percent this pilgrim season, according to the OIC of the Nallathanniya Police station Inspector Anil Prasanna Jayasinghe and Nuwara Eliya district Administrative PHI Gamini Perera.
They said even those bringing these non degradable items dispose properly into the garbage bins placed along the path as a result of the successful awareness programmes conducted by the police and other authorities and media publicity programmes.
He said very few pilgrims bring along liquor or visit under the influence of liquor this season. They had received very constructive support in this programme of keeping the environs of Sri Pada clean from the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha.

Priyanka on her goal for 2017
A New Year calls for new resolutions, but for international superstar Priyanka Chopra, the struggle is in sticking to it. The actress, who has been on the top of her game with a booming production gig in India, has also had a successful run with her American television show Quantico. Although the actress looks like she is in a fit and fighting form, she revealed in a recent Facebook video that she is far from being healthy and hence her resolution would be to #GetHealthy.
Talking about her goal for 2017, Priyanka said, My goal for 2017 is to do something that I have never done before. I always make resolutions and I always break them but this time I have decided that I am going to get healthy.
The world has a misconception that I am a super healthy person... the truth is I drink 25 cups of coffee a day, I eat all kinds of rubbish food. I have no time. I sleep for like four hours. So this year, I am going to get healthy, I am gonna workout, I am gonna eat the right food, I am going to treat my body well, I am gonna sleep eight hours.
After ringing in the New Year in Goa, PeeCee flew back to New York to continue work on her television show. She will also be seen making her big Hollywood debut in the action-comedy Baywatch in May this year.

Promising future guaranteed
The blue-water naval capabilities of key Asian States have ushered a new strategic environment, and the Indian Ocean has become an extremely important geo-strategic space. While the maritime space of Asia is strongly connected to the Indian and the Pacific Ocean through trade and commerce routes, there is a difference in the power dynamics of the Pacific and the Indian oceans.
The power play in the Pacific is dominated by its proximity to the US, centrality to US security policies, and now the rise of Chinese naval power. In contrast, the Indian Ocean Region has maintained a multipolar characteristic.
Let us take a step back and consider when the change started. This transition in global power to Asia began with the economic awakening of East Asia, driven by the growth of China. And the complementary growth of ASEAN countries; particularly Indonesia and Vietnam.
While the South Asian region has not matched the same level of development, the region is acquiring an intrinsic significance of its own underpinned by the growth of India. Currently India is the fastest growing large economy in the world and the power transition in the Indian Ocean will be heavily influenced by South Asian developments.
The Indian Ocean plays a crucial role in the future of both these major powers. The sea routes through the Indian Ocean are very important to China's maritime trade and energy supply. Therefore, both countries will have to respect each others legitimate interests to ensure that their future prospects are not affected in the long term.
Unlike the Asia Pacific, the Indian Ocean region is not economically integrated.
No single power or a coalition will be able to maintain peace and stability on their own in the Indian Ocean. In capacity terms also, no country is capable of handling the maritime security threats and challenges in isolation, no matter how advanced and developed it might be. In addition, it is preferable that the region continues its historical multi-polar characteristic and prevent a spillover of tension from other regions.
In such a background, all maritime nations have a role to play in ensuring the overall balance of strategic weight. Smaller nations such as Sri Lanka, even with comparatively limited maritime resources can become an integral element of maritime security in the region. It is our view that the Indian Ocean is in need of a mutually benefiting security architecture established on a multilateral basis.
There is also space for an effective multilateral governing structure. In this regard, I may add that the Prime Minister has expressed an interest in crafting an Indian Ocean Order with accepted rules and agreements that would guide interactions between states. Speaking here in Singapore last year at the inauguration of the Indian Ocean Conference Mr. Wickremesinghe called for this Order to be built on a consensual agreement and that no singular State should be allowed to dominate the system.
The Indian Ocean Order would have the primary responsibility of upholding the freedom of navigation in the Indian Ocean, ensuring that shipping and air routes to East Asia and beyond are kept open, building closer economic cooperation among countries in the region.
In this regard, my Prime Minister called for a dialogue between SAARC and ASEAN leaders. Perhaps that can happen sooner than later and we would be delighted to play a role. Be that as it may, Sri Lanka remains committed to preventing international terrorism, transnational crimes and people smuggling in the seas around our country. Supplementing the blue water capability of the Sri Lanka Navy and the consolidation of the Sri Lanka Coast Guard are areas of concern for our Government. We are also reviewing the possibilities of integrating the capabilities of the Navy and the Air Force.
Repositioning Sri Lanka
The Government of Sri Lanka has a clear vision of what it wants Sri Lanka to be in the world today.
We are repositioning Sri Lanka to maximise our relationships with both our historic and new trading partners to leverage our geo-strategic position to make us a hub of the Indian Ocean as well as a transshipment port for the Bay of Bengal trade.
To fully tap this potential, Sri Lanka is engaging in initiatives with regional players who have major economic stakes in the Indian Ocean.
Sri Lanka is now pushing towards further integrating with the world by undertaking reforms to facilitate trade, and encourage productive foreign investment.
We have set a target of boosting exports to US$ 20 billion by 2020; an increase in exports of nearly 80% during 2016-2020.
It is unfortunate that in the last decade or so the previous government in Sri Lanka lost its focus on exports. Exports to GDP fell from 34% of GDP to less than 14%. So, it is critical that we implement our plans to leverage on our competitive advantages as now planned.
Trade and investments
Unlike ASEAN which provides its members with a largely stable and peaceful regional environment to focus on economic development at formative stages of their countries development, SAARC has not been able to achieve the same level of regional integration.
These geo-political realities require that Sri Lanka build strong bilateral relations with Bay of Bengal members of ASEAN in addition to its fellow South Asian members. In addition, we cannot be content with our traditional markets, and we must look beyond for new opportunities.
India and Sri Lanka hope to finalize an Economic Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) by 2017. The ETCA will enhance the scope of our existing Indian Sri Lanka FTA to extend freer movement of goods and services with the added emphasis of cooperation in the development of technology and in investments.
ETCA will provide an impetus to the existing synergies and has the potential to promote rapid growth of the sub regional economy between Sri Lanka and the five South Indian states, that is Tamil Nadu, Kerala, Karnataka, Andra and Telengana which today accounts for and economy of 500 billion dollars.
We are also negotiating a FTA with Singapore. Singapore already has a Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA) with India. Therefore, we believe that by next year the Singapore-India (CEPA), the Indo-Lanka ETCA and the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA will enable the southern sub region of South Asia and Singapore to establish a tripartite arrangement for trade and investments.
Sri Lanka is supporting the One Belt - One Road economic initiative, in line with the major historical role we played in the Maritime Silk Route. This will consolidate our position to become the Hub of the Indian Ocean while further integrating us with the Asian markets.
Chinese investments will be primarily directed to industrialization and further development of the Hambantota Air Sea Hub in southern Sri Lanka.
In addition a 1.4b dollar reclamation is now underway adjacent to the city of Colombo for the creation of a 560 acre Financial City, under English law, to fill the vacuum for offshore financial service between Singapore and Dubai.
Chinese investors have made significant commitments to invest equity in the China-debt strapped Hambantota port and the Mattala international airport the previous Government built; now as PPP ventures.
Our government is currently negotiating a 1.3 billion USD lease agreement with CM Port of China to lease the currently empty deep sea port to integrate with the proposed industrial zone.
Chinese investors
It was just this Saturday we inaugurated the 15,000 acre, that is 50 square kilometre Sri Lanka China Logistics and Industrial Zone to become a serious player in global production networks.
It was revealed at the inauguration that Chinese investors were ready to bring in five billion USD in investments in to the zone in just the next three years.
The economic cooperation with Japan is as important to us. We are grateful that four decades of Japanese donor assistance has made a significant impact on our economic and social developments in Sri Lanka.
The Japanese Prime Minister has also appointed a senior official to especially coordinate Japanese Sri Lanka Joint Comprehensive Partnership Programme that was entered in to last year.
After some lull, Japan is once again also getting involved in several major infrastructure projects in Sri Lanka including Light Rail and expressways.
Many may not be aware that Sri Lanka also is home to the second largest natural harbour in the world in Trincomalee; said to be one of the finest deep sea harbours in the world.
In fact, there have been many sea battles to control the harbour. The Portuguese, Dutch and the English have each held it in turn. In 1942 the Japanese Imperial Navy attacked Trinco harbour and sunk three British warship anchored there.
While it has a large 99-unit tank farm built by the British during the war and mostly unused, except for some tanks by the Lanka Indian Oil Company, we have now initiated action to develop the port centred the larger Trinco development zone.
The government is working with India and Japan to develop Trincomalee with Surbana Jurong of Singapore already being contracted to draw up a city master plan.
The proposed container terminal at the Trincomalee Port will serve trade in Indias east coast as well as Bangladesh and Myanmar.
Export market
With the strong interest in utilizing the zones along the Southwest Corridor centred around the Colombo port and the Western Megapolis; logistics and industrial zone centred around the Hambantota air-sea hub and the North East corridor centred around the Trincomalee port development by investors from China, Korea, and Japan and also likely from India, we plan to create an export market focused on Europe, China, Japan and USA and the crescent of markets around the Indian Ocean.
Among the Middle East, Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Myanmar, Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia there exists a fast-growing population currently of over two billion people. This combined market has the potential of three billion consumers by 2050.
Going forward, our development strategy will be aimed at capturing trading opportunities within these identified Indian Ocean markets by pursuing trade liberalisation agreements with their governments.
We have already made the application to the European Union to regain the GSP+ facility for preferential access to the single market and are hopeful of an agreement by next year. European Commission has expressed their confidence that the GSP Plus trade concession would be given favourable consideration.
A concerted effort is also underway to improve the business climate domestically. Far-reaching governance reforms that are rules based have made investment and business more secure and certain.
Sri Lanka is taking measures to increase investors ease of doing business more directly. For example, we are bringing a number of government agencies together to create a one-stop investment and trade-facilitation shop under the Agency for Development. We are reviewing our laws and regulations to create a simple rules-based business environment: including those related to land ownership, as well as tariffs and para-tariffs.
We have adopted policies that enable private enterprise to thrive: for example, Sri Lanka has a simple three tier tax rate with the lowest at 14 percent. Together these reforms  alongside our educated workforce and solid infrastructure  are making Sri Lanka the most attractive, secure and competitive investment destination in the region.
In conclusion, I would like to point out that those of us who are geographically located in the Indian Ocean region have a primary interest in the security of the Indian Ocean, which is directly linked to our economies.
Therefore, managing competition and strengthening cooperation would be essential given both these economic and strategic security factors which have a direct impact on the future of this region.
There will always be tension, such as between large countries and their smaller neighbours. However, the countries in the Indian Ocean region have more in common in terms of history, culture and religion, than what sets us apart.
We believe that the Indian Ocean Region now facing an extraordinary opportunity to create something new in the global context and something historically uniquely beneficial to its people. Thank you.

Real Estate: The top five emerging market trends
Last year (2016) was a challenging year for real estate. Most of the year was rapt with uncertainty in the aftermath of two seismic events-Brexit and the US elections.
Anyone thinking of buying property became hesitant and decided that it was more prudent to wait until there is more clarity about how these unexpected events would affect the market.
Buyers in Mexico were worried that a wall might be built sending the country into an economic recession. English investors were concerned that the inevitable departure from the EU would be cataclysmic for the domestic property market.
Analysts at Lamudi have spent some time in the lab crunching the stats, and the following is the five trends they predict will shape real estate in 2017.Steady as she goes
With torpid real GDP growth across most of the emerging markets, governments are reluctant to raise interest rates. So where does that leave the market In many cases due to difficulties securing construction financing and the cash required to purchase prize locations, there is now a situation where investors will look to avoid risk more so than usual. In brief, this will create a calm market, where real estate prices remain stable. While construction activity is expected to pick up pace in the second half of 2017, the start of the New Year will be slower to gain momentum.
Emerging markets are a portfolio essential
A smart move for the New Year is to hedge your investments in Europe and the US by including some higher risk real estate investment funds. In a world of unattractive global investment options going against the grain might be the ticket to prosperity.
Despite the International Monetary Fund cutting its global growth forecast to 3.4 percent for 2017, there is hope in the developing world.
Attack of the drones
Unmanned aerial vehicles or drones will be the big tech advancement in 2017. Real estate agents will look to gain an edge over competitors by providing flyovers of properties for exclusive properties and agents. Home buyers and sellers will be able to use drones to their advantage. One caveat: certain flights will need the local tower's permission along with a flight plan filed online. There is a real danger that drones could crash into commercial planes; considering the damage a bird can do this is something users need to bear in mind.
Optionality is back
As investors flee to relative safe havens; developers and investors are seeking solace in multi-use projects. Owners of versatile buildings can benefit from finding the maximum rent from the ideal tenant; whether that is through offices, retail outlets, or residential blocks. Flexible leases will become more common in a co-working type of arrangement.
Lamudi-the global property platform whose global HQ is in the trendy Kreuzberg area of Berlin, Germany share their building with other Rocket Internet startups. This is an ideal way for owners to get the full rental income while companies can engage in knowledge sharing.
Smart home tech and IoT
In 2016 we read a lot about the revolution that the Internet-of-Things (IoT) promised and 2017 may be the year for smart home technology to become more widespread. The problem is that there is a lot of competition, but no single company has managed to combine multiple appliances and apps into a seamless catch-all product.
That could soon change with Google and Apple entering the market, giants of uniform user experiences. So brace yourself for smart houses that make life very, very easy for you.

Reserve Jan 22 to combat dengue
Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith yesterday appealed to all priests in the Colombo Archdiocese to dedicate January 22 for combating the spread of dengue.
The Archbishop made a very special appeal to all priests in the Archdiocese to spend time on January 22 as a special day of prayer and activity to help curb the spread of dengue among the people.
Following is the full text of the Archbishops appeal: Given the number of increasing casualties and the people affected by dengue, I am making a very special appeal to all my priests in the Archdiocese of Colombo to please spend time on Sunday, January 22, as a special day of prayer and activity to help curb the spread of this disease among our people.
I would very much encourage them to organise voluntary cleaning programmes in their churches, schools and institute premises and the surroundings as well as the areas within and outside homes, removing all factors that may contribute to the breeding of dengue carrying mosquitoes.
I appeal very specially to the youth to spearhead this programme in the neighbourhoods and surroundings on that particular day.
I myself will be taking part in this campaign personally at St. Lucias Cathedral, Kotahena on the same day.
It would be also significant if the priests could speak to the leaders of the other faiths and get them to join in this campaign.

Running out of excuses over LG polls delay: Rathana Thera
The government is delaying the Local Government Election and we are running out of time, having brought this Government into power, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday, he said Local Government bodies are running without peoples representatives over a long period. There are suggestions that the LG Polls should be held according to the old system after the act is being passed in Parliament for the new system, he said.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, politicians are underestimating the people. There is no excuse for the Governments failure in delivering on what can be done without a two thirds majority or a referendum. The preferential votes system can be abolished and the proposed Audit Comission Bill and the Bill on Tender procedure can be brought and passed in Parliament, he said. This is a Transitional Government. This is similar to a soft ball of clay. Anybody can change its shape.
Some are now trying to change its shape according to their requirements. But we wanted to establish a regime where we can tell the regime openly if its treading on the wrong path. We demand the President and the Prime Minister appoint an Intellectual Committee immediately to make decisions on the countrys development, he added.

Separate Act needed to address racial discrimination: Swaminathan
It would be more effective to have a separate Act to address the issue of racial discrimination, Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M Swaminathan said.
While pointing out that racial discrimination is covered through the Fundamental Rights enshrined in the Constitution of Sri Lanka, Minister Swaminathan said if Sri Lanka could have a separate Act on Racial Discrimination it would be instrumental to bring about a separate body which could monitor incidents of discrimination and act as a mediation body to resolve conflicts regarding racial discrimination.
Swaminathan said this when he met Member for Bruce MP Julian Hill at the Australian Parliament yesterday. The minister and Hill discussed many issues including economic development, education and how to overcome racial discrimination in multicultural societies.
Hill pointed out that Australia has a Racial Discrimination Act to ensure that citizens are not discriminated based on their race and ethnicity in schools, places of work and in public.
He said this piece of legislation extends to media and social media, making it illegal to insult, offend and vilify other cultures and races.
Even media has to adhere to the laws against Discrimination and if a breach is committed vilifying another race, action can be taken.
The law also provides protection for free speech and political debate in Australia, the MP said.

Shortage of perahera elephants
Although nearly 40 elephants are needed for participation in renowned cultural pageants like the Kandy and Kataragama perahera festivals, only around 30 tamed elephants are available today for deployment in these peraheras, said the Basnayake Nilame of the Ruhunu Maha Kataragama Devalaya D.P. Kumarage.
He was addressing members of the Tamed Elephant Owners Association at a meeting in Kataragama on January 15.
Association members earlier held a pooja at the Kataragama Devalaya seeking blessings and intervention of the Deity of Kataragama to get domesticated elephants held at elephant orphanages for deployment in peraheras including rituals held at devalayas.
Basnayake Nilame Kumarage said nearly 45 domesticated elephants found at temples after being trained to participate in peraheras are now languishing in elephant orphanages after being taken over.
Although the President had responded to their requests and directed the Wild Life Department to release these elephants to the temples and devalayas there had been a delay in carrying out this order.

SL unitary status at risk if Executive Presidency is abolished: Rathana Thera
If the existing Executive Presidency is abolished, the unitary status of Sri Lanka will be abolished automatically. According to the Supreme Court judgement given by Deshamanya Suppiah Sharvananda in connection with the 13th Amendment, the unitary status of the country is kept and protected by the powers of the Executive President, Senior Consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday, he said they will not let anyone to abolish the unitary status of the country.
The new constitution is the idea and views of a handful of people who promoted and supported LTTE terrorism in the past. They formulated the new constitution. It is full of separatist moves. Now they are trying to pretend that it is the view of all Sri Lankans which is absolutely false, he said.
According to Ven. Rathana Thera, no one promised to completely abolish the Executive Presidency. What was promised was to cut down harmful powers. In page 10 of the Maithri Paalanayak, the President very cleanly states that he will not completely abolish the Executive Presidency. If the new constitution completely abolishes the Executive Presidency, the unitary status of the country will automatically be abolished, the Thera said.
The President clearly promised not to amend parts of the constitution which require approval through a referendum. I was with Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera at the time when he said the Executive Presidency should be abolished but I did not hold the same view on the topic. At that time I clearly stated my view which was to amend the harmful powers of the Executive Presidency, he added.

Sri Lanka at risk due to climate change
Sri Lanka, which has become a victim of natural disaster in recent years, will be at a greater risk following climate change, especially global warming, Chairman of the Community Resilience Center (CRC) Dr. Novil Wijesekara said.
He said the next generation will be the ones which will face direct impact of the global climate change, and it is important to educate and empower the youth to go green, he said.
The Sri Lanka Youth Climate Summit (YCS)-2017 funded by the US embassy to Sri Lanka, is to take place from January 20 to 22 at MAS Athena Thulhiriya.
Dr. Wijesekara pointed out it is timely that such a summit on climate change being held, where Sri Lanka is at the verge of a severe drought.
The YCS is a dynamic climate education process to empower youth and create a network actively calls for sustainable development. YCS is organised by the Community Resilience Center (CRC), an organisation promoting community capacity against challenges such as natural disasters, environmental pollution and climate change.
The summit aims to create youth climate action champions provided with mentorship, advocacy, networking and resources.
Hundred university students from Sri Lanka have been selected to participate in the YCS.
The technical facilitation for the YCS is provided by the Wild Centre, New York, USA.
Climate Change Secretariat of the Ministry of Environment and Mahaweli Development is a technical partner for the summit.
The Wild Center Project Manager Jennifer Kretser said the Youth Climate Programme pioneered by their non-profit-organisation, started in 2008 and progressed rapidly to win the recognition of US President Barck Obama in 2014.
Responding to a question from the Daily News on the environmental perspective of the current large scale development projects taking place in Sri Lanka. Kretser said, as an organisation they are promoting the UNs sustainable development goals.
Whatever and wherever the projects are, the Wild Centre promotes development programmes to assess the pluses and the minuses of those development projects and encourages finding a solution leading to sustainable development, she said.
Youth Climate Programme Coordinator of the Wild Centre Keiti Morgan said the best part of the YCS is the youth empowerment. The youth are given skills and tools while assisting them to become active young leaders in their communities and at a global level, Morgan said.
The crux of the YCS is the climate action plan created at the summit by the student participants for their own communities, which they want to actualise, she added. The Disaster Management Centre, Consortium of humanitarian Agencies, Janathakshana and many corporate sector organisations are accommodating the YCS.

RAMESWARAM: A 27-year-old Sri Lankan was arrested at Arichal Munai, Tamil Nadu, after he arrived by an illegal ferry, four days after another man from the island nation was held from the same area.
Police said Rochen (27) told them he had come here from Vavuniya in the island nation after paying Rs 40,000 to a ferry operator, who dropped him and then went back to Sri Lanka. On January 13, another Lankan national Prithviraj landed in the same area by illegal ferry and was arrested.
Meanwhile, officials quoted fishermen from Mandapam as telling them that the situation in Palk Straits was scary, as gold and ganja smugglers were making frequent trips to Dhanushkodi and Talaimannar and the fishermen were caught between the smugglers and the Sri Lankan Navy.
They wanted the Coastal Marine Group to further tighten vigil on the sea.

Synchronising the digital customer and business
The Digital phenomenon is a hot topic that has forced businesses to question whether it is a passing trend or a strategic boardroom discussion which needs C-Suite profound thinking.
Often, we have observed clients consider Digital as a silver bullet for devising innovative ways of upgrading the business in search of opportunities of meeting market expectation to trends. However, there are still questions that are not clearly understood.
Who is best geared to adopt the digitalisation What are the underlying requirements for the transformation Is it limited only to delivering better customer experience and efficiency Or, is there a standard model to follow
While nurturing a successful Digital Transformation, an organisation should focus on a few key blocks of the digital economy, such as integration of businesses or services, SMAC (Social, Mobile, Analytics and Cloud) paradigm, successful transformation or externalising internal value creation to meet customer expectation less-mature digital businesses are focused on solving discrete business problems with technology silos, hence failing to provide an unique customer experience.
Today, life and technology are inseparable. Across industries, people expect the latest experiences delivered faster and more seamlessly than ever before. Banking is among a few industries such as Telecom, Retail and Media which has spearheaded the digital transformation. Digital modernization has enabled banks to completely redefine the manner people perform the financial transactions. A smart, enterprise-wide digital approach positions them to deepen customer satisfaction and loyalty, driving long-term relationships, increase wallet share, thus, the bottom line.
According to BizTech, 61% Senior Bank Executives Globally believe a Digital Strategy is a high priority, as it forms the basis of how banks encounter the market challenges. Banks are not renowned for innovation and relatively slow movers due to the industry constraints. Having said that, over the last few years we have seen a tremendous growth in the Fintech domain, intensifying pressure for a paradigm shift in the way traditional banks operate.
As the financial landscape evolves, the digital economy exposes banks to new challenges, digital-savvy competitors, evolving channels and an immensely competitive alternative financial ecosystem comprising telecoms, Internet giants and other innovative Fintechs. Today Fintech companies represent all cogs of the Banking and Financial value chain including Payments, Lending, Remittance, Investment and Personal Finance.
The digital and tech-savvy customers have forced the banks to rethink their strategy and emphasize on customer centricity, commoditisation of Products and Service and avail services anytime, anywhere. In articulating a successful Customer Centric Strategy banks should allot prominence to factors such as, New Service Creations, Data Analytics, Interconnected Service Blocks, Social Values of Customer and Customer Demand for immediacy.
In today's context Digital business proficiency is no longer a nice to have; it is a requirement, especially in crafting a successful Digital Transforming Strategy, For this, there are five key dimensions a digital bank should focus on, in implementing the strategy.
Simplification of operational model
Over the years, banks have developed staggeringly complex operating models aided by legacy and silo systems and rigid internal workflows. In achieving the simplification, what's vital is to create an eagle eye view, across all business functions, especially encompassing marketing management, customer experience, re-engineered business and customer processes accompanied by corporate- wide alignment for customer centricity.
Use data-driven insights and analytics holistically across the bank
With digital, data driven economy, it's apparent that expectations from customers are changing significantly. Banks are required to develop a much deeper, holistic understanding of their customers. Banks need to acquire, integrate, aggregate and analyze multiple sources of internal and external data. This information, in turn helps the banks to analyze their customers needs and trends, further be present with a relevant solution at the time of need.
Integrated customer experience
Today, banks have started looking beyond an Omni-Channel transactional banking experience. Banking gurus today are exploring ways to provide a seamless user experience, by merging a wide array of services, partners, technologies and delivery channels.
Open IT architecture and next generation technology
Today, banks are in a fight for the customer, not only with other banks but also non-banks thus.
It is important to build a truly open and scalable application architecture with a particular emphasis on connectivity and cyber security.
A sound API strategy is key in creating an open and connected bank linking internal and external services in providing a seamless user experience.
Fintech - Frenemies
The time where banks could run their business in isolation, with very little sharing of cross-industry partnerships or platforms is over. Banking is under a massive attack from Internet giants and legacy-free Fintech startups, creating the need for systematic cross-industry alternative digital solutions.
In conclusion, it is important that a holistic view and a strategy is in place for successfully transforming the bank into the digital era.

Taking the Thai route
Amid a multitude of dining options that make Hotel Road in Mount Lavinia the culinary hub that it is, the brand new Thai Cuisine La Rambla stands out - not just as the only Thai restaurant in the area, but also for its impeccable offering. With a menu devised by the deft hands of Chef Papat Pachid from Thailand, and set against the quirky charm of a whitewashed building in the heart of Mount Lavinia, this new restaurant will offer a delicious and completely authentic glimpse of Colombos favorite indulgence when it comes to dining out.
This is the second Thai restaurant by Tasty Caterers, which also owns Thai Cuisine Boulevard on Queens Road. Headed by well-known Thai chef Mama Ari Jittman, Boulevard has become Colombos go-to for Thai in the short span of a year. Tasty is also the name behind some of Colombos old favorites including Tasty on Fife Road, Caf on the Fifth, and Crossroads in Nawala.
With La Rambla, the vision is to offer the same authenticity and deliciousness but with a distinctive touch, says Tasty Founder Kanthi Jayamaha. Kanthi is closely involved in the day to day operations of her business keeping it attuned to the changing needs of her customers.
Our La Rambla customers have been asking us to expand the small Thai cuisine section of our menu for years. Since this area has no other Thai restaurant, we felt that it would be fitting to let La Rambla focus exclusively on Thai cuisine, said Jayamaha
Kanthi has enlisted the skills of Chef Papat Pachid for the job. Chef Pachid has worked in several Thai restaurants across South East Asia, most notably in Singapore. His signature dish is a fiery but sophisticated Panang Goong, or prawn red curry. A fragrant curry paste packed with red chillies, lemongrass and coriander is tempered by coconut milk, palm sugar and Thai aromatics for this delicious classic; Chef Pachid says it is second nature to him, adding that if the diner is happy and returns regularly to us for their Thai fix, then I have done my job.
The menu at Thai Cuisine La Rambla is extensive but well curated, with Chef Pachid devising each item to preserve the authenticity of his countrys cuisine with a nod to the heat seeking Sri Lankan palate. Begin your meal with a starter such as Crispy Marinated Chicken wrapped in Pandan Leaf or a classic Tom Yum, or try something new with Yum Som O (pomelo fruit salad with chicken and shrimp in Thai dressing).
Creamy, well spiced and lightly tempered Chicken Phad Thai is a must have from the menu.
You can take a break from the heavier dishes with a fresh Green Papaya Salad, and sip on tangy tamarind juice. If youre vegetarian, theres Tofu Eggplant or Taow Hoo Pak Ruam (tofu and long beans).
For dessert, the classics come into play; try Kao Niew Ma Mwong (sticky rice with mango) or Woon Gati, Thai coconut jelly served with jaggery for a lighter end to your meal. For drinks, the restaurant staff will recommend the subtle lemongrass iced tea or fizzy, sweet ginger lemonade.
At La Rambla, diners can enjoy their meal inside the restaurant, decorated with a quietly oriental touch and complemented by piped music playing melodic folk tunes from Thailand. Or they can dine al fresco with the mild sea breeze. Restaurant managers Noel Kelaart and M.P. Mahanama are veterans in the hospitality industry and will be on hand to assist diners with the menu and other queries. The restaurant can accommodate up to 50 diners and will remain open around the year from 11am to 11pm. A semi private dining area inside is well suited for small events and extended family dinners. Make your reservation by calling 0112725403.
Over the years, Tasty Caterers has grown to be an instantly recognizable and trusted caterer in Sri Lanka. Reputed for its outdoor catering services encompassing a variety of cuisines such as International, Fusion, BBQ, Mongolian, Oriental, and Sri Lankan, the team is equipped to cater for Weddings, Cocktail Parties, Childrens Parties, and even small gatherings.

Things that stink
It is commendable to see the Government finally getting down to collecting source separated garbage under four categories (biodegradable, non-biodegradable, glass and paper). However, it is important not only that initiatives are made, but that they are also sustained. For sustainability to take place, it is important to receive the cooperation of all stakeholders including consumers service providers, policymakers, legislators and most importantly the law enforcement authorities. Law enforcement authorities are so very important because many people lack discipline in this country and have the, Someone else will clean up after me, so why bother attitude.
There was a time, not so long ago, in Sri Lanka when the Environmental Police and local authority personnel (Public Health Inspectors), worked together and imposed massive fines on those who threw garbage on streets. This resulted in a drastic reduction in garbage thrown on streets; but unfortunately the practice of imposing fines was discontinued, and the environmental police now seem to be absolutely inactive. Dumping of garbage on the streets should attract high fines (like those proposed for traffic offences), and no one would object to it. Such action would close the door on those who refuse to cooperate, thereby perfectly complementing the source separation program and making it more of a success. Source separation is so crucial for making final disposal more efficient, mainly in terms of increasing the lifespan of final disposal sites, as well as the conservation of resources, through recycling.
More action needed
Its high time the authorities took some serious action to stop people dumping garbage on streets, which not only discourages those who provide their cooperation to solve the problem, but also pollutes neighbourhoods and public places and make them uninhabitable.
The Dehiwala beach is a good example of this, where rubbish thrown by residents living by the canals finally end up on the beach. Areas adjacent to the railway tracks in Dehiwala have also become garbage dumping sites for various types of garbage including construction waste. If not for its uncleanliness and polluted seawater (mainly due to the sewer water coming through the canals, which could be mitigated if serious efforts are made), the area between Dehiwala bridge and Mt. Lavinia Hotel has great potential for tourism. Even in its current state, some of restaurant on the Dehiwala beach depict a glimpse of paradise. Stretches of beaches close to cities in some countries are considered gold mines for tourism. Although creating awareness aimed at preventing people from throwing garbage on streets, polluting waterways etc. is useful, many people in Sri Lanka require more persuasive means to change their behaviour. In light of the Governments plan to develop a Megapolis, these matters will need to be looked at in a more serious manner.
Ideally, garbage disposal should be as smooth as in most developed countries where the rules are clear, and both consumers and service providers respect/observe them.
However, taking into consideration the ground level realities in Sri Lanka, this ideal stage could only be achieved gradually by setting practical and realistic targets (as against complex and unrealistic targets towards which people are reluctant to offer their cooperation), which once achieved, would make people realize the clear benefits of their actions, and motivate them towards increased cooperation.
On the contrary, unrealistic targets like separation of garbage into more than 2-4 segments, or banning lunch sheets may be too burdensome for most people, and may dampen efforts even before you can get started. Not necessarily slowly, but steadily is the way forward. If roads and public places are clean, drains do not get blocked when it rains, and when everyone realizes that everyone else is contributing their little part, they will be willingly to cooperate towards the sustainability of the system.
Current issues
Mentioned below are some of the key issues currently faced by people with regard to garbage disposal:
Garbage collectors demanding money (on a daily basis in some areas). This encourages people not to hand over garbage to garbage collectors but to dump them on roads. Poorer neighbourhoods are given step-motherly treatment due to their inability to respond to monitory demands made by garbage collectors. So many of them resort to dumping garbage on streets.
Secondly the garbage collection system does not follow any standard pattern of collection (regular days and time of collection) that is convenient and consistent. So whenever the garbage collectors fail to appear on the days they are supposed to, people are forced to dump their garbage on roads (especially in neighbourhoods where residents have small houses and no garden space).
In addition, there is no system that stops other people from throwing garbage in front of your property or in public areas.
There is also no system of garbage disposal for people who go to work and have no one to hand over the garbage to the garbage collectors.
Moreover, people dumping garbage in drains resulting in such trash collecting in front of other peoples houses or blocking drains, resulting in flooding. Some people burn garbage in drains thinking that it is justifiable to use drains as incinerators.
There is also no proper system to handle disposal of construction waste (especially small volumes). Although local authorities provide a service that addresses this issue, in most cases, they are riddled with corruption, and customers are asked to be on a lengthy waiting list.
We also have no place to hand over electronic waste (computers electrical appliances etc.).
A possible way forward
Given these problems, there are certain suggestions I would like to mention to solving some of the above mentioned problems:
Introduce laws that make the house owners responsible for keeping the front of their homes clean, (including drains by introducing individual drain separator mesh), and severely punish those who put garbage in front of other peoples homes or public places. Providing households with CCTV cameras on demand, in order to prove the conduct of lawbreakers or accepting photographs/videos as evidence. Lawbreakers, if found guilty, should be fined severely (e.g. Rs 25,000 minimum fine). It is only then that people would take serious their responsibility in keeping the environment clean. Households who are unable to keep the front of their homes clean should be provided a paid service that could be offered even by the private sector.
Fully activate the environmental police and have a hot line for complaints that ensure the anonymity of the persons making the complaint. Each complaint should have a reference number for follow up purposes. Mobile (bicycle) patrols should be sent out to identify and bring to the book those littering roads, public places etc.
In addition, an on call paid service that is void of corruption should be provided for the disposal of construction material, and items too large to be included in the daily garbage collection (e.g. tree trunks, large branches, old foam mattresses, broken furniture etc.). This should ideally be done by the private sector, with a maximum response time of 48 hours.
We also need a collection system for other waste (e.g. electronic waste, CFL bulbs, batteries etc.) should be introduced. Probably specially delegated places like supermarkets could serve as collection points.
The government should also have an immediate ban on Styrofoam lunch boxes should be implemented due its detrimental effects on the environment. In order to encourage the reuse of polythene bags, supermarkets /shops could be requested to charge Rs 5 for new polythene bags, and ban the free provision of shopping bags.
Clean used polythene bags could be collected at supermarkets and could be reused at the request of customers free of charge. The services of the environmental police could be obtained in order to ensure that supermarkets and shops implement this policy. Another system is for supermarkets to sell reusable (strong) bags and completely stop the provision of free polythene bags, so as to encourage consumers to bring their own bags.
Compost bins should be provided to pre-schools and schools. Utilizing the compost, students should be taught practical aspects of home gardening during the class periods for environmental education. Some pre-schools have a pot for each student and they are taught to put soil and seeds in it, and water the plant.
What they learn through this is for life. In the face of global climate change and threats to food security, home gardening should be encouraged at every level. Even a 1-5% increase in food production through it is a great achievement.
The below mentioned 7 R principals should be compulsorily taught (in an absolutely practical sense) in all schools. It could also be popularized in institutions (similar to how 5s principles have been made popularized).
Reject: Reject products, services, techniques, methods which cause significant environmental damage and that you can do without (e.g. plastic, polythene)
Reduce: Reduce your energy, water and resource usage
Reuse: Reuse what you have used, to reduce impact
Reclaim: If you cannot reuse 100% use whatever part that can be reclaimed.
Replace: Replace products, services, methods with more environmentally friendly alternatives. (For instance, replace polythene bags with bio degradable bags, replace plastic files with cardboard files, and replace vehicular transport with bicycles, walking or vehicle-pooling)
Repair: Repair broken items without purchasing new items
Recycle: Recycle products which cannot be reused as a whole
Finally in order to educate people of the initiatives, have 20 second TV advertisements to establish correct and incorrect behaviour, and warning people of the serious consequences they will face if laws are violated. Private companies could sponsor these ads as a part of their CSR programmes.

Trumps Insurance for everybody replaces Obamacare
President-elect Donald Trump said in a weekend interview that he is nearing completion of a plan to replace President Obamas signature health-care law with the goal of insurance for everybody, while also vowing to force drug companies to negotiate directly with the government on prices in Medicare and Medicaid.
Trump declined to reveal specifics in the telephone interview late Saturday with The Washington Post, but any proposals from the incoming president would almost certainly dominate the Republican effort to overhaul federal health policy as he prepares to work with his partys congressional majorities.
Trumps plan is likely to face questions from the right, after years of GOP opposition to further expansion of government involvement in the health-care system, and from those on the left, who see his ideas as disruptive to changes brought by the Affordable Care Act that have extended coverage to tens of millions of Americans.
Pharmaceutical companies
In addition to his replacement plan for the ACA, also known as Obamacare, Trump said he will target pharmaceutical companies over drug prices.
Theyre politically protected, but not anymore, he said of pharmaceutical companies.
A week before President-elect Trump's inauguration, lawmakers passed a preliminary budget measure that starts the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act. A week before President-elect Trump's inauguration, lawmakers passed a preliminary budget measure that starts the process of repealing the Affordable Care Act.
The objectives of broadening access to insurance and lowering health-care costs have always been in conflict, and it remains unclear how the plan that the incoming administration is designing  or ones that will emerge on Capitol Hill  would address that tension.
In general, congressional GOP plans to replace Obamacare have tended to try to constrain costs by reducing government requirements, such as the medical services that must be provided under health plans sold through the laws marketplaces and through states Medicaid programmes. House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) and other Republicans have been talking lately about providing universal access to health insurance, instead of universal insurance coverage.
Trump said he expects Republicans in Congress to move quickly and in unison in the coming weeks on other priorities as well, including enacting sweeping tax cuts and beginning the building of a wall along the Mexican border.
Secretary of health and human services
Trump warned Republicans that if the party splinters or slows his agenda, he is ready to use the power of the presidency  and Twitter  to usher his legislation to passage.
The Congress cant get cold feet because the people will not let that happen, Trump said during the interview with The Post.
Trump said his plan for replacing most aspects of Obamas health-care law is all but finished. Although he was coy about its details  lower numbers, much lower deductibles  he said he is ready to unveil it alongside Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.).
Its very much formulated down to the final strokes. We havent put it in quite yet but were going to be doing it soon, Trump said. He noted that he is waiting for his nominee for secretary of health and human services, Rep. Tom Price (R-Ga.), to be confirmed. That decision rests with the Senate Finance Committee, which hasnt scheduled a hearing.
As Republicans in Congress gear up to repeal the Affordable Care Act, two Pennsylvanians reflect on their different experiences under Obamacare. As Republicans in Congress gear up to repeal the Affordable Care Act, two Pennsylvanians reflect on their different experiences under Obamacare.
Trumps declaration that his replacement plan is ready comes after many Republicans  moderates and conservatives  expressed anxiety last week about the partys lack of a formal proposal as they held votes on repealing the law. Once his plan is made public, Trump said, he is confident that it could get enough votes to pass in both chambers. He declined to discuss how he would court wary Democrats.
So far, Republicans have taken the first steps toward repealing the law through budget reconciliation, a process by which only a simple majority is needed in the Senate. The process would enable them to dismantle aspects of the law that involve federal spending.
The plan that Trump is preparing will come after the House has taken more than 60 votes in recent years to kill all or parts of the ACA to adopt more conservative health-care policies, which tend to rely more heavily on the private sector.
Republican leaders
I think we will get approval. I wont tell you how, but we will get approval. You see whats happened in the House in recent weeks, Trump said, referencing his tweet during a House Republican move to gut their independent ethics office, which along with widespread constituent outrage was cited by some members as a reason the gambit failed.
As he has developed a replacement package, Trump said he has paid attention to critics who say that repealing Obamacare would put coverage at risk for more than 20 million Americans covered under the laws insurance exchanges and Medicaid expansion.
Were going to have insurance for everybody, Trump said. There was a philosophy in some circles that if you cant pay for it, you dont get it. Thats not going to happen with us. People covered under the law can expect to have great health care. It will be in a much simplified form. Much less expensive and much better.
Republican leaders have said that they will not strand people who gained insurance under the ACA without coverage. But it remains unclear from either Trumps comments in the interview or recent remarks by GOP leaders on Capitol Hill how they intend to accomplish that.
For conservative Republicans dubious about his pledge to ensure coverage for millions, Trump pointed to several interviews he gave during the campaign in which he promised to not have people dying on the street.
Obamas law
Its not going to be their plan, he said of people covered under the current law. Itll be another plan. But theyll be beautifully covered. I dont want single-payer. What I do want is to be able to take care of people, he said Saturday.
Trump did not say how his program overlaps with the comprehensive plan authored by House Republicans. Earlier this year, Price suggested that a Trump presidency would advance the House GOPs health-care agenda.
When asked in the interview whether he intends to cut benefits for Medicare as part of his plan, Trump said no, a position that was reiterated Sunday on ABC by Reince Priebus, Trumps incoming chief of staff. He did not elaborate on that view or how it would affect his proposal. He expressed that view throughout the campaign.
Timing could be difficult as Trump puts an emphasis on speed. Obamas law took more than 14 months of debate and hundreds of hearings. To urge lawmakers on, Trump plans to attend a congressional Republican retreat in Philadelphia this month.

Underworld Blood Wars : No less gory
So, four years after the last Underworld film (titled Awakening) we now have a saga titled Blood Wars, which delivers just as promised, blood that is, and lots of it.
The plot, however irrelevant it might be to execute flicks such as this, is this: Selene (Beckinsale) is still on the run from both the Vampires and Lycans who seek her blood to become immortal. But there are some who want to end the war between the two clans once and for all.
Selene thus goes through a maze of discovery, deceit, alpine peaks, a frozen waterfall, and even that limbo spot between life and death.
Modern enhancements
So even if all these dont make sense to you because you missed out on the first four parts of the franchise, it doesnt take away the little bursts of adrenaline from watching Lycans turn into full-blown werewolves (and end up looking like modern enhancements of the creature from Michael Jacksons Thriller).
Beams of sunlight fry some unfortunate members of the vampire clan, and a serious action sequence involving two warring members goes hilariously wrong: they keep screaming and pumping bullets into each other at close quarters, only to find that both of them are immune to it. Oh, and you get a flashback, in fast-forward, from previous instalments every time someone tastes someone elses blood.
Bonus entertainment
The cinematography is washed by a constant icy-blue filter, as the camera moves through Pragues Gothic structures and inside the lairs where all the action takes place. There really is nothing else to say about this snoozefest of a film, save for the generous dose of overacting you get from some council elders (were looking at you, James Faulkner) and some momentary cunnilingus for bonus entertainment.
Not done yet
The ending hints at a possible sequel and that this tiresome war between werewolves and vampires is not done yet. All we have to say is this: Its still better than Twilight.

Ven. Rathana forms National Council to steer country on right path
Senior consultant to the President and MP Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera said he has set up a National Council with the participation of people from all walks of life - especially professionals, intellectuals and academics.
The national council will be the alternative Parliament in Sri Lanka. Anyone can join this council, the Thera said. I will lead this council which will tell the country where it should head. It will support any force or regime which takes the country on the right path, he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute in Colombo yesterday, he said he can be the senior consultant to the President and at the same time criticise the government.
This is the new political culture. A National Movement can take any government in the correct track, he said.
The thera said he and Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka may have different ideas on the economic policy but there was no discussion on this.
The MP also said the council will be a free entity from the prison of party politics.
It will never be a political party. There is no need to topple the government. It can be taken in the correct path. We tell the President to keep his promises and do what he promised to do to the people through Maithree Paalanayak. The Joint Opposition which does not have any political vision does not have a future, Ven. Rathana Thera added. He said his main intention is to build a national movement to guide this and all future governments on the correct path. I will also never form a political party, Ven. Rathana Thera said.

Villagers complain of mass scale illegal sand mining in Kalaoya basin
Mass scale illegal sand mining carried out in the Kalaoya basin bordering the Wilpatthuwa National park has caused immense danger to several locations along the Kala Oya banks, residents complained to the authorities.
Residents alleged that racketeers involved are doing this sand illegal mining business after obtaining permits to the lands fed by the Thawusamadu project on the pretext of collecting paddy by inveigling the officials at the secretariat.
Residents alleged that several tractors laden with sand mined in the area crisscross the Wanathawilluwa Sanctuary daily, damaging the eco-system.
They allege that the Wanathwilluwa Divisional Secretary seemed to have turned a blind eye towards this illegal sand mining racket.
Residents alleged that wild animals including elephants frightened by the rumbling of tractors and other vehicles in the park, invade the adjoining villages.
However, Wanathwilluwa Divisional Secretary Sanjeevani Herath when contacted said they had never issued a sand mining permit in respect of this area in the Kala Oya.
She said a permit was issued earlier, but had been withdrawn later. There is a paddy tract known as Thawusamaduwa and two permits had been issued to persons cultivating paddy land. "Today houses were being built in the area for the benefit of several displaced families who had returned to the area. They had been issued with a permit to mine sand for making cement bricks."

Words worth
A few yards off the ramparts of Galle Fort, the pedestrians had no clue as to what was happening inside the colonial building. They were not interested anyway. If you took a leisurely stroll into the Galle Fort, you would have noticed quite a beehive of activities: volunteers guarding the entrance for the events covered by festival and day passes, another group of enthusiasts heading to the pre-booked events while the rest attending the free events scattered around the premises. Not interested in any event You could still roam the terrain and chill out sipping a free cup of tea while shelling out a few rupees to the refreshment available ubiquitously.
Such is how the Fairway Galle Literary Festival 2017 took off last week.
Following heavy criticisms and controversies and a subsequent lapse of a few years, the festival withstood an otherwise-retirement-possible. And now the festival seems to sail smooth. It is all in motion with no discontinuation in sight.
Anjan Sundaram was a participant whose question and answer session dragged on beyond the usual period of 15 minutes. His documentary Deciphering India: the Great Indian Male was an unorthodox retelling of Indias male dominance. Titled as Lunchtime Illumination, the series hosted short films free of charge. Sundarams work cannot be called a short film. His was a comprehensive documentary on how an average Indian female had willingly or unwillingly been facing the male suppression. Determination of sex, Sundaram proves with evidence, is part and parcel of Indian culture. The birth of a female child is left for the male community to decide. Even the abortion is allowed when the newborn happens to be a female.
Apart from Sundarams documentary, the Lunchtime Illuminations series documented the postwar upbringing in Sri Lanka. Except for a film or two, the rest of the films feasted on the conflict of interests between the main ethnic groups in this country. For instance, most filmmakers focused on how the Sinhalese, as the majority nation of this country, ill-treats the minorities.
The festival moved on with a number of excursions, duets between literati, workshops aimed at budding writers, literary dinners/luncheons, thinking out loud sessions where bestseller authors would voice their experiences and some more.
David Macdonald and Dawn Burnham elaborated their passion of dealing with the wild cats. The audience was made privy to the very much private world of the leopards, lions and other wild cats. The co-existence among them, surprisingly, is lethal. Even if a lion could speak, the humans would not understand the animal, Macdonald quoted Wittgenstein in order to explain the complex behaviour pattern of the animal famous for fierceness. He went on to enlighten the audience with the sad story of the diminishing lions in Africa and other subcontinents.
Professor Peter Frankopan, whose session of changing history along the Silk Road, had a packed audience. No attendee could leave the audience until the session is over. The Oxford-educated professor enlightened the audience on realigning our understanding of the world, pointing towards the east. He was extraordinarily deft in the way he explained about his subject to a non-specialist readership.
The literary luncheons and dinners were held outside the usual premises. That provided the participants with the opportunity to explore deep aspects of literature and allied areas with bestseller authors such as Colm Toibin. Then there were sessions allocated to private affairs too! That too opened the doors to a private and leisure chat with the authors while enjoying the mocktail (that consists local delicacies such as king coconut and papaya juice).
When the New York Times tagged John Gimlette as someone who writes with enormous wit, indignation and a heightened sense of the absurd, they were not in the wrong. His talk on his celebrated nonfiction titled as The Elephant Complex was full of wit. The longer you stay in Sri Lanka, the more you will know the country. But - Gimlette paused before adding - you will understand the country less. His graphic presentation provided insights into what he has been observing in Sri Lanka. Gimlette has handpicked the strangest aspects of the commonest events that we experience on an almost daily basis. It is a detailed biography of Sri Lankas elephants as well as the allied subjects.
The Sinhala Day was held free of charge, albeit without much enthusiasm. Piyal Kariyawasam, an award-winning author, who also happened to be a moderator at the festival was not quite happy with his session.
The audience had no single question to ask during the Question and Answer session. I find it pathetic as a moderator, Kariyawasam observed.
Ashok Ferrey, on the contrary, had to practise immense concentration dealing with the Question and Answer sessions. They are huge writers, Ferrey commented, and they needed to be dealt with only following proper research. The attendees have already purchased the books of the panellists to execute a constructive dialogue. The bookstall was crowded almost every time.
The Galle Literary Festival is yet to reach Sri Lankas common masses. The festival has evolved a considerable journey with a considerable progress probably owing to the heavy criticism and ire it attracted during the initial stages when the Festival Founder Geoffrey Dobbs was completely in charge of it. The festival is been a utopian experiment among the English-speaking crowd in a land where the majority is not conversant in the same language. Whether it will reach the common audience one day, only time can predict.
Anna Lotfulina, a Russian software engineer, who attended the festival with her husband and one-year-old son, was quite happy about the festival.
We can, of course, read some of those things on the Internet. But nothing like meeting your favourite author in person. When you get to interact with them, you can read their body language too in addition to the books they have authored, Lotfulina commented.
Most works of fiction as well as nonfiction, discussed at the festival, contain at least one reference to Sri Lanka. Anita Nair, for instance, has made reference to Galle in her maiden novel Idris: the Keeper of the Light published in 2014. The Indian author, however, has never been to the city until her participation at the GLF in 2017. The volunteers had a busy schedule throughout the festival, as the sessions were held at different sites at the same time. The Fotocube, the official partner in photography was an omnipresent tribe occupied in an amazing job of covering every detail of the festival.
The festival had something resourceful to offer to avid readers as well as would-be prolific writers. Grown with the love of words, the festival has a long path to roam to prove the written words real worth.
