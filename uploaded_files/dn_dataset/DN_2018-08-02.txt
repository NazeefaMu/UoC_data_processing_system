So the two of us are, I would say, in terms of the cinema, one!
This years Cargills Sarasaviya Film Festival pays tribute to the great Dr. Lester James Peries, four months after his demise in April this year at 99 years. This piece, written by Kumar de Silva, a former member of the Jury of the Sarasaviya Film Festival and Dr. Peries ghost biographer, was published in the Daily News in 2004.
The Sarasaviya Film Festival that year featured a unique phenomenon in that films by both Dr. Peries and Sumitra Peries were in competition.
The formers Wekande Walauwwe was screened at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2003 and spawned rave reviews on the French Riviera.
The latters Sakman Maluwa (after a hiatus of eight years since Duwata Mawaka Misa in 1995) was produced by Ceylon Theatres to celebrate its 75th anniversary in 2003.
Reproduced below are brief extracts from that long Sunday afternoon chat Kumar de Silva had with the couple at their (then Dickmans Road) residence on what it felt like to be in competition.
Sumitra: Actually the very first time Lester and I won awards together was at the very first Sarasaviya Film Festival. He got the award for Direction, and I for Editing, for the same film  Gamperaliya. This is the first time we are in competition arent we 
Lester: Yes at a Sarasaviya. She has got far more Sarasaviya awards than I have. So even if I get anything at this festival (I dont know) I dont think she should feel bad about it, and if she gets anything I certainly wouldnt feel bad either.
Sumitra: You see weve been long in the game and the younger people must be thinking why we are competing. We dont want to compete but the fact is that, I guess, the whole system is such that you dont quite have a choice. We also have an obligation to the others who have participated in our films.
Lester: To be honest I think it is a very uneasy feeling having films by both of us competing. Both films are primarily written by me. It might be in the writing I did worse for her than I, or the other way around. But I dont think we will consider that problem. Were been associated with the Sarasaviya Film Festival from its inception. Therefore I dont think we should be upset at all in any way. If she gets an award Ill be happy, and, I hope she wont be unhappy if I get an award
Sumitra: I hope so too. I did work with Lester on Wekande Walauwwe. I think I have a credit as Production Designer. Everything you see in the film I might have helped the Art Director to put there. So I feel Im part of it in as much as he feels a part of Sakman Maluwa. We dont feel about it as his film or my film. The only thing is he wrote both. So I could always tell him that he wrote the better script for himself and not for me !
But my choice was my choice of the short story, and I couldnt get anyone to write the script for me. Finally Lester offered to do it and it worked out well. He did write his too since he was pre-occupied with the idea since our days in Paris..So there it was.
I think this is a wonderful opportunity for the idea of our symbiotic relationship to manifest itself because there is no dividing line saying his or mine. Our bank accounts are also one. So is also our creative work.
Lester: Half the time I dont know where the money goes and I never ask. So the two of us are, I would say, in terms of the cinema, one !
LJP - Legend lives on
I visited your pyre late that night
and watched the brilliant glow on a bed of blazing logs
The scattered stars in the laden sky blinked;
in grief that you were gone
in relief that you were free from pain.
I felt the same.
I sat by your pyre late that night
and watched the crackling logs crumble
into a bed of red hot ash; vainly looking for a form,
but you were already ash.
The mourners who gathered that evening were all gone.
Their moments of glory on the little screen,
now a post-event record, fondly re-played into eternity.
And as midnight neared, the heavens gently wept
as the two stray canines I had for company left me for shelter.
The flames, now docile, licked the logs to embers.
They would go on until dawn streaks the sky.
Tomorrow the walkers will walk and the joggers will jog
at the Independence Square, just like any other day
and you will be sifted into an earthenware pot.
My illusive shadow lengthens under the waning Vesak moon
and as I leave the pyre the hymns you loved so well,
the hymns that bade you farewell
religiously reverberate in my ears.
I grieve . I still grieve !

Stoned Alone  is a spin-off of  Home Alone
If youre a fan of the popular 90s comedy franchise Home Alone, which starred actor Macaulay Culkin as the young lead Kevin, youll be happy to know that Hollywood star Ryan Reynolds is planning come up with a riff of the film.
The Deadpool actors next project, titled Stoned Alone, revolves around a 20-something stoner, who misses his flight for a holiday ski trip and then gets high. In that state, he starts believing that people are breaking into his house and realises that actual burglars have actually broken into the house.
Just like Kevin in the Home Alone films, the lead in Stoned Alone also attempts to battle the burglars and teach them a lesson, with rather creative attacks. This R-rated comedy will be directed by Augustine Frizzell from from a script by Kevin Burrows and Matt Mider. As of now, the cast of the film has not yet been finalised and its yet to be seen if Reynolds will be a part of the film. Currently, the actor is working on the upcoming mystery comedy Detective Pikachu which revolves around the kidnapping of a teenagers father, and the young boy is then forced to team up with Pikachu in order to find him.

Afghanistan opens $3TN oil, gas, and mineral  deposits to Sri Lanka
Afghanistan which packs over US $ 3 trillion in identified natural resources has issued an open call to Sri Lankan business sector to visit them, prospect and reap benefits. I found out those Sri Lankan miners to be well skilled said Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Afghanistan to Sri Lanka Munir Ghiasy in Colombo.
Ambassador Ghiasy was addressing Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen during his courtesy call on Minister Bathiudeen in Colombo.
We have formulated new policies to open air corridors with several countries to boost trade of well-known Afghan products including dry fruits, knitted carpets and semi-precious stones. Also we have trillion dollar worth untapped metal, mineral such as iron, copper and gold as well as mining resources including oil and gas said Ambassador Ghiasy.
There are vast such untouched deposits. These resources have been building up for centuries. Huge demand is building up now to prospect them. But global multinational companies are costly. Therefore we are waiting to see the countries in this region and our neighbours entering Afghanistan to prospect them, rather than very costly global firms.
As a result we invite Sri Lankan businesses and firms to prospect in Afghanistan. If necessary Sri Lankan firms can comein first and just see the possibilities. At present, only a nominal level of bilateral trade takes place between the two countries. Sri Lanka can strengthen its trade and business cooperation with Afghanistan further.
Sri Lankas total trade with Afghanistan last year was less than US $ one million, at only US $ 820,000. And our exports were at $700,000; slightly increasing from US$ 630,000 of 2016, said Minister Bathiudeen.
Though our mechanised mining sector is small, our geological surveys and mines management is at advanced levels. Therefore your offer could be picked up by even non-mining corporates in Sri Lanka.
Printed books, newspapers and other printing industry products, were Sri Lankas major exportin 2015, 2016 and 2017 (accounting for 68% out of total exports in 2017). Imports from Afghanistan were negligible.

Agrahara insurance for pre-2016 retirees as well: Sagala
The Agrahara medical insurance scheme available for post-2016 retired public servants, was to be extended to public servants who had retired before 2016 as well. Arrangements for the purpose were currently being prepared on the initiative of the Prime Ministers Chief of Staff; Youth Affairs, Project Management and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
A sum of Rs.50 million had been set apart in the 2018 budget to implement the programme. A discussion regarding the programme, chaired by Minister Sagala Ratnayake, had been held at Temple Trees on July 31.
The contributions to be made by beneficiaries to obtain the Agrahara insurance cover and the insurance benefits they would receive, were given attention at the discussion.
A ministry release said the pre-2016 pensioners receiving cover under the insurance programme, would receive wider benefits than beneficiaries of other insurance schemes. They include insurance cover for all medical needs and insurance entitlement for life.
It had been proposed to provide insurance cover in respect of treatment in private hospitals and laboratory investigations as well. It would include Ayurveda treatment at home, or indoor treatment at Ayurveda hospitals or government hospitals.
Insurance cover would also be provided to heart operations at private hospitals, cancer, kidney, liver or brain operations. Wider insurance cover would also be provided to purchase hearing equipment as well as for eye operations, total disability or death due to natural causes or accidents.
The minister also explained those features in detail, to the delegates of pensioners unions as well as public servants who attended the discussion. The union delegates who showed a positive response also made their suggestions and inputs for incorporation in the proposed programme.
The Agrahara insurance scheme was first introduced by the Public Administration and Home Affairs Ministry through a circular; No. 5/1997; and became operative on January 1, 2006.

The Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Unit Director of Engineering Wasantha Palugaswewa told the Daily News that in the Anuradhapura district, the average water levels of 13 major tanks was at 30-percent capacity, which had caused a sharp drop in the current Yala cultivation.

Nothing is more annoying than finding blackheads dotting your face, putting a damper on your dream to achieve bright and glowing skin. And the more you clear them, the more they reappear. No matter how well you take care of your skin, they just show up sometimes - usually at the worst possible time. If youre finally ready to rid yourself of this pesky little black dots, be sure to keep on reading.
Blackheads symptoms
Blackheads are small bumps that appear on your skin due to clogged hair follicles. These bumps are called blackheads because the surface looks dark or black. Blackheads are a mild type of acne that usually forms on the face, but they can also appear on other parts of the body.
Different causes of blackheads
Blackheads form when a clog or plug develops in the opening of hair follicles in your skin. Each follicle contains one hair and a sebaceous gland that produces oil. This oil, called sebum, helps keep your skin soft. Dead skin cells and oils collect in the opening to the skin follicle, producing a bump called a comedo. If the skin over the bump stays closed, the bump is called a whitehead. When the skin over the bump opens, exposure to the air causes it to look black and a blackhead forms.
Defining comedones
Skin comedones are not a fun problem to deal with. These little bumps that are so common in teenagers and people with oily, acne-prone skin can be a source of annoyance for anyone who wants a smooth, healthy looking complexion.
Comedones are another term for whiteheads and blackheads. Blackheads are referred to as open comedones, and whiteheads are called closed comedones. Comedones arise when pores become blocked with an oily substance called sebum -a sticky substance produced by the sebaceous glands in the skin.
Dark spots on nose
Black pores, or comedones, form when dust and debris embed into openings in the skin that excrete oil. The discoloration is the result of dark matter trapped near the surface of the clog, giving the pore a blackish appearance, or blackhead. Remove the blackheads on your nose of blackheads by using a number of cleansing steps to loosen the clog and clear the pore. Once the pores clear, you can take steps to keep them from clogging again.
Different causes of whiteheads
Although they may look different, pimples, blackheads, and whiteheads are all a result of clogged pores. To understand what a pimple is, you need to understand the difference between whiteheads and blackheads. If that pore is completely clogged and remains closed at the surface, its what we call a whitehead.
Whiteheads are known as closed comedones. The follicles beneath your skin become filled with bacteria and have a very small opening at the top of your skin. Air isnt able to enter the follicle. The bacteria inside of it doesnt undergo a chemical reaction, so it stays white in colour. This type of acne is also found on your back, shoulders, and face.
Blackheads turning into pimples
In reality, acne has nothing to do with dirt, and trying to scrub blackheads away could actually turn them into whiteheads. Blackheads are just open pores that are clogged with excess skin oil, also called sebum, and dead skin cells. Unlike popping a pimple, popping a blackhead really can make acne worse.
Getting rid of blackheads
To get rid of blackheads for good, you need to prevent them from forming. One of the biggest pore-clogging culprits is sleeping in your makeup. Stock up on cleansing oil, to wash away makeup residue, gunk, and grime.
Tea tree oil touts antibacterial, antifungal, and anti-inflammatory properties that make it savior for unblocking sebaceous glands, combating breakouts, and banishing blackheads simultaneously.
While its certainly tempting to grab an extracting tool and magnifying mirror, and get up close and personal with your pores, resist the urge. Instead, schedule an appointment with a professional. Experts have the right tools and training to extract those pesky pore intruders without doing damage to your skin.

Celebrating four years of success stories
Bone Marrow Transplant Unit at Asiri Central Hospital recently celebrated its fourth anniversary bringing renewed hope to the lives of many patients, especially children.
Despite Bone Marrow transplant being a curative treatment modality available globally for over 50 years, the country then lacked the facilities and expertise to help ailing patients mainly those suffering from thalassemia, a rare genetic blood disease and life-threatening disorder to receive life-saving treatment.
For thalassemia patients lifelong blood transfusion is required. However, the continuous transfusions can cause complications such as iron overload and blood-borne infections and a limited lifespan.
With the support of Italys Cure2Children Foundation, Asiri Health successfully setup Sri Lankas first-ever dedicated Bone Marrow Transplant in 2014, with specialised nursing and medical staff and a custom-designed isolation ward for patients recovery.
Initially, the local team received their training from the foundations Italian doctors and even to-date receives supplemental training locally and from overseas. The Unit has performed well over the years achieving a success rate of 32 transplants.
Headed by Dr. Lallindra Gooneratne, Consultant Haematologist, Asiris Bone Marrow Transplant Unit, continues to provide fresh hope for not only thalassemia patients but also for those afflicted with leukaemia, lymphoma, myeloma, and other blood disorders.During the past four years the unit has treated patients aged from one and a half years to those in their late eighties.
Dr. Gooneratne noted, Our programme was the first in the country to begin bone marrow transplantation. Using state-of-the art technology and facilities we were able to successfully treat patients with even very complex conditions. One of our very first young patients was completely cured and successfully completed her O/L examination recently.
While Bone Marrow transplants require a matching donor, Asiri Hospital assures patients of finding matching donors via overseas registries. Working in collaboration with Indias Datri Registry and other registries in countries such as the United States, United Kingdom and Germany, Asiri Hospital sources possible donors for patients.
While the consultation for patients are done free of charge, all patients have access to the Units multi-disciplinary team including a consultant paediatricsurgeon, consultant paediatrician, consultant anaesthetist, general physician, specialists from the blood bank, a micro biologist, and senior nursing and support staff.
Commenting on the processes followed Dr. Gooneratne said, Each patient will be in our unit for approximately 45 days during the transplant, three special positive pressure roomsare available to ensure the air inflow is purified.
Additionally, medication used for patients are never compromised as we always dispense the highest quality drugs and these are prepared in a special room by a trained and specialized individual. Even the meals are prepared in a special manner according to the dietitians order and goes through a hygiene process into the unit.
Continuously maintaining stringent quality standards, the Asiri Bone Marrow Unit has been accredited by the Joint Commission International (JCI), among the worlds leading nonprofit patient safety organizations.
Additionally, the Unit is a member of the Asia Pacific Blood and Marrow Transplantation Group (APBMT), an international organization involved in hematological stem cell transplantation, which cooperates on basic and clinical research in Asia-Pacific countries. The Unit routinely submits all patient outcomes to the Group towards further collaboration and research.
As a pioneering facility, the Unit is also recognized and approved by the Postgraduate Institute of Medicine, University of Colombo, as a training facility for all postgraduates prior to certification.

The Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited (CPSTL) condemned the actions of the Ceylon Petroleum Bowser Owners Association, which recently threatened to disrupt island-wide transportation of fuel without negotiations with the CPSTL.
The CPSTL, in a statement, said the threat by the association to halt fuel distribution, demanding an increase in the transportation allowance, was a move to hold the countrys energy security at ransom and that it did not recognise the body as a responsible representation of the fuel bowser owners supplying to the state entity.
The CPSTL stated that it would not condone the associations arbitrary actions or threats to halt fuel distribution, and had taken swift and necessary steps to ensure uninterrupted fuel supply to the nation by engaging directly with independent bowser owners.
As a state entity, we are committed to safeguarding the countrys energy security and serving the best interests of the people. Over the past year, we have been working to transform CPSTL and we are currently on a growth trajectory. We are always open for discussions, and to find solutions, Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Limited Chairman Dammika Ranatunga said, However, any move to cripple the national fuel supply, threaten the countrys energy security for inconvenience the public with intimidation, will not be entertained.
The meeting held on July 17 with independent fuel bowser owners was successful and it welcomed any positive discussion with the association to reach a mutual arrangement that would be beneficial for the CPSTL and the association, and importantly, the countrys people, the statement said.

Ensuring financial discipline
The decision taken by the Cabinet to prohibit recruitments to public and semi-government institutions above the approved cadre is to be commended. In fact the move was long overdue. It was recently reported that there were over 30,000 extras in the public sector who were whiling away their time without work but paid for by the taxpayers money. This, out of a total of 1.1 million public sector employees. No doubt, these additional hands are the recruits of politicians, who think they have a license to treat the public sector as their private property. Both main political parties should take responsibility for the sad plight of our state institutions.
The decision to hold the heads of departments responsible for any recruitments outside the approved cadre too is a move in the right direction. This will now give these department heads the necessary cover to refuse accommodating requests for recruitments from politicians. This is because the department heads will now be asked to pay the wages of these additional hands out of their own pockets, in terms of another Cabinet decision taken on the same issue. The rule will apply down the line to include provincial councils and local government institutions as well.
A circular issued in this regard also states that the Secretary to the line Ministry, Chief Secretary to the Provincial Council, Head of the Department and the Head of the Finance Unit of the relevant institutions will be responsible for any employee recruitment against the laid down instructions.
In another welcome move, the Government, through the circular, has also sought information on increased salaries and allowance paid to employees of public sector institutions without obtaining recommendations from the National Salaries and Cadre Commission and prior Treasury approval. This move too should have been implemented much earlier. Had this been done before, the Treasury could have saved much Viz. the astronomical salaries and the cost of perks granted to some of the former Sri Lankan airlines top staff. The move would also prevent salary anomalies and the heads of departments playing favourites by granting disproportionate pay rises to selected staff while leaving out others. It would also result in a contended workforce who would now be assured of non-discrimination.
Be that as it may, it would also have been ideal if this regulation was to be applied across the board. Why also not bring in parliament into the ambit At present there is no cap on the salary limits of parliamentarians. This also applies to their perks. The allowances being paid to MPs appear to be on an upward swing with regular monotony. In addition the government is also now saddled with an additional 10,000 local government members, following the recent LG elections. If the whole idea is to trim the fat in state institutions, this state of affairs fail to bear scrutiny.
The state service as a whole should be considered as a single unit and the rule applied to include even the very top. We say this today as there are countless Presidential Advisors and advisors even to ministers. There certainly would be no issue if such advisors are picked on merit so that their advice would be beneficial to the country. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had advisors for a myriad of subjects including a team of Buddhist monks to advise him on Buddhist affairs, when one would have thought that Rajapaksa would be the last person to need advise on this score, given his perennial presence at temples.
In the meantime, JHU parliamentarian the Ven. Athureliye Rathana says he is quitting the post of Presidential Advisor since no advise is being sought from him. It is not known if the Ven. Thera was paid for his advisory services. If so it is money down the drain since there was no value for money given, according the Ven. Theras own admission.
Measures should also be devised to ensure that the huge salaries being paid to heads of state institutions and top executives are justified, and, above all, if they are qualified for the posts they hold. These include our foreign envoys. We say this because most of our so called ambassadors are, or had been, proven failures and what is more a liability to the state, going by what is being unraveled now. Some of our embassies too are overstaffed and it would be ideal if this regulation is employed to cover our foreign embassies as well.
The government has at last seen the need to reduce the financial strain which has been over-burdening most of our state institutions. This, no doubt, is a small measure to start with, considering the financial mire into which some of our state institutions have plunged into. But on the long run, the new regulations, as a cost cutting measure, would certainly have its impact in bringing financial stability to our ailing public sector institutions.
The bane of our countrys public sector institutions has all along been financial indiscipline. Politicians, to a large degree, should take the blame for this state of affairs. Let no politician, at least now, run roughshod over this new measure.

## Title: Expressway to Badulla
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Expressway to Badulla
According to RDA statistics, 80 percent of the construction of the Southern Expressway Extension project has been completed. The government expects to vest the Southern Expressway Extension (up to Mattala) with the public in early 2019.
The purpose of the Southern Expressway Extension is to link the Mattala airport and Hambantota harbour to Colombo city. As advantages of the Southern Expressway, the development indices (education, health, and agriculture) of the Southern Province and the Moneragala district will be improved.
The Southern Expressway Extension to Mattala would be a good development opportunity for the Hambantota, Moneragala and Badulla districts as well as for Embilipitiya and Sooriyawewa in the Sabaragamuwa Province. However, because of current road networks and transportation methods, the maximum benefits to the Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara districts are uncertain.
Hence the Uva - Ruhunu Linking Expressway would be a solution to get the maximum advantage out of the Southern Expressway for the Badulla, Moneragala, and Ampara districts.
The proposed expressway can be in sections, Mattala to Kudaoya via the existing Matara - Wellawaya (A1) highway and the four-lane expressway from Kudaoya to Nakkala -Moneragala via Buttala. Then Badulla can be accessed in less time via Badalkumbura and Passara towns. The Passara - Badulla road renovation is progressing. Vehicles to Moneragala and Ampara can turn toward Moneragala via Nakkala junction.
Even though the maximum advantage would be for the Badulla district, the proposed highway will be constructed entirely within the Moneragala district. Hence the feasibility of construction in Moneragala must be considered.
The length of the proposed expressway would be 40-55 km.
Selection of destination points
In this proposal, the destination points have been selected considering minimum environmental effects and existing geographical features. Kudaoya, Buttala and Nakkala are located less than 200 metres above MSL (mean sea level). Hence when considering the longitudinal profile along the proposed expressway axis, it is almost horizontal. To avoid the Yala National Park and other areas that elephant traverse, the best destination point is Kudaoya.
Yala National Park
For the Mattala to Kudaoya section, the existing Matara - Wellawaya road can be utilised. Or else, a new road can be developed for expressway vehicles, west of the existing A1 Road. The east corridor of the A1 Road shall not be developed because it is a boundary of the Yala National Park. Several points that elephants traverse are available between Kudaoya and Lunugamwehera for elephants to cross the Matara - Wellawaya (A1) road. Hence construction of a superway or expressway through the Yala National Park might be a disaster in the environmental sense. So the existing Matara - Wellawaya (A1) road can be used after engineering advancements.
Existing irrigation tanks
The Moneragala district is a major district enriched with a higher amount of functioning irrigation tanks. Moneragala, Wellawaya and Buttala are known for dairy farms, sugar production and agriculture. All the tanks are linked and interconnected. If a new road network is being developed, it will not negatively affect the existing lifestyle of the people or the irrigation system. Proper studies must be done at the feasibility study stage to protect the livelihood of the people in the region.
Availability of construction materials
Unlike in the case of the construction of the Southern Expressway, the construction materials (sand, soil, quarry products) are easily available in the Moneragala district. Hence the construction unit cost (cost per one km) of the Uva - Ruhunu Linking Expressway might be less than other expressways in Sri Lanka.
Development of Badulla - Passara road
Construction of an expressway to Badulla is a very costly option because of the geology and topography of the land. Hence, renovation of the Badulla - Passara road as an interchange or access road to the expressway would be the best solution to connect Badulla town to the proposed expressway.
In the pre-feasibility study stage, these factors should be considered: (1) engineering: selection of the expressway centre line, carriageway width and boundaries and the best destination locations minimising construction and other costs; (2) social: methods to minimise the damage to livelihood, available irrigation system, forest cover and animals.
[Benefits]
* Easy access to Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara from the Southern Expressway.
* Possibility of extension up to Ampara (at a later stage).
* Economic benefits of proximity to Hambantota harbour and Mattala airport for the Badulla, Moneragala and Ampara districts.
* Expedite the rate of development in education, health, and personal and social factors compared to the Sabaragamuwa and Central Provinces.
* Development of the tourism and agriculture industries in the Uva and Eastern Provinces.
This is my concept and it is open for feasibility study to be modified, revised or changed according to technical, financial and social and environmental factors.

False news articles published in certain newspapers regarding the Galle International Stadium, caused an upheaval in the country, recently. The need of the hour was for the media to act in a responsible manner, without spreading misinformation, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene said.
Abeywardene said certain individuals had altered a recent speech he had made and published it to mislead the nation.
Minister Abeywardene was addressing Samurdhi officers at an awareness programme held at the Galle Four Gravets Divisional Secretariat, on July 30. Minister Abeyewardene said there were about 80,000 schoolchildren in the Galle city, adding that the time had come for everyone to look into their future welfare.
The Galle International Cricket Stadium was closed for almost 350 days a year, and that was a major problem, he said.
The government, which had filed cases against 30 middle-class families in Galle Fort for illegal constructions, had been using several buildings it had built illegally at the Galle stadium, the minister said, adding that it was wrong as the law should be applied equally to all.

The Google Loon project has been renegotiated and will be re-launched in Sri Lanka.
Minister of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment, Harin Fernando said he had visited the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) in Geneva and obtained an approval to relaunch the Google balloon project in Sri Lanka in the near future.
Fernando addressing the Infotel ICT launch ceremony in Colombo on Tuesday said this will be a good opportunity to showcase that the country will have islandwide 4G connectivity which will also help improving speed and connectivity making digitalization more meaningful. Once the Google balloon project succeeds there will not be any white spaces in connection with 4G connectivity, he said.
The minister said the government has made strides in the digitalization process with over 860 government offices getting fiber optic connectivity and they intend to move up to 3,600 fiber optic connections shortly. Sri Lankas e-service is voted as the 36th best in the world by the UN.
It was however, the role of the private sector to take the digitalization process forward and champion the cause, Minister Fernando said.
Now that we are in our last stride we have got our priorities right. I have spoken to the President, Finance Minister and Foreign Minister and in the next two years you can see the positive changes. We have restructured the entire ICTA, got a new set of board members and a new chairman. We have brought down our huge vision to a vision that we could actually achieve, he said.
The minister also said that he regretted the inability to be successful in some of the ambitious initiatives such as getting the online payment system on track. This is what happens in Sri Lanka - if you want to make a change or do something people with vested interests do not allow you to do it. We have done an Electronics Act amendment in Parliament. Now we have digital signatures and digital contracts can be signed and biometrics used. The law is passed and I have done my part in Parliament.
Fernando added that the Infotel expo has been doing a yeoman service in the last few years to nourish the ITC sector in Sri Lanka.

Harsha raps scaremongers: FTAs beneficial for Lanka
Everyone should get-together to the make the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement and the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) a success, irrespective of political differences without spreading unfounded fears, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva said yesterday.
He said that undue fears have been created among the people about the Singapore - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreeement by those who are in the opposition.
He added that no individual professionals, would come to Sri Lanka from Singapore to practice nor professionals from a third country under the provisions of the same agreement.
He made these observations during a press conference held at Sirikotha, the UNP headquarters.
He said that some scare mongers say that the economy would tumble rather than improve due to this agreement and that is baseless.
These scare mongers say that the Singaporean profesionals would come to Sri Lanka and practice, the doctors, for example.
It is unfounded. Architects, lawyers, doctors and engineers cannot come and provide services in Sri Lanka, he said.
The Minister said that intercorporate transfers is possible. For such a transfer, a Singaporean company should invest in Sri Lanka and could bring their specialised persons or professionals under conditions for a short period, to serve in Sri Lanka. For Intercorporate Transfers one has to have five years experience and one years experience in the specific company, he said. Such professionals would get visa for two years only.
The State Minister brought to the notice that the Comprehensive Economic Co-orperation Agreement (CECA) between Singapore and India which enables 150 professionals to visit other country and practise which is applied both ways. But as scare mongers say ships loads of professionals from one country do not migrate to other country seeking opportunities due to immigration and emigration laws in the respective countries. Finally these numbers migrating are governed by the national law. So there is no reason to fear that the professionals would flood our country. Some also attempt to create a fear that people from a third country like Pakistan or India would come to Sri Lanka under provisions of this agreement, Silva said.
But that is also not true. One has to be a citizen or a resident of Singapore to become eligible for intercorporate transfers. It is not easy to obtain a Singaporean Citizenship.There are only 570,000 green card holders in Singapore.
De Silva said all have to integrate with the developing Asian Region. I dont see my country as a South Asian country. I see it as a Indian Ocean Country. We are not stuck in a South Asian Mentality. We should not forget the 2500 year long history. In the coming decades, the Indian Ocean region is developing and no other country has a better position than Sri Lanka to take advantage of the growth in the Indian Ocean economy, he said. So we must integrate and if we dont we are the only country that would be left behind from the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership to which 16 Asian countries are to sign in November. We should quickly integrate with the growing Indian Ocean Community.

Health sector made vast strides after 2015 - President
President Maithripala Sirisena on Tuesday, said that around 150 people in Sri Lanka die of Non Communicable Diseases daily and the country should strive to bring down the deaths caused by NCDs to 50.
The President noted that the health sector had made vast strides under the Good Governance government that came to power in 2015.
President Sirisena said that Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne had played a major role in bringing significant development in the health sector.
The President made these remarks at a ceremonial felicitation of Minister Dr. Senaratne on his election as the Vice Chairman of the World Health Organisation. The felicitation ceremony was jointly organised by the Health Service Union Federation, Health Ministry and the World Health Organisation.
President Sirisena further said the health sector was subjected to radical changes under this government under the guidance of Minister Senaratne.
"Accordingly, the prices of 48 varieties of essential drugs have been brought down drastically. Besides, the prices of stents have also been reduced significantly, ie; the price of a normal stent from Rs. 75,000 to Rs.24,000 and a medicinal stent from Rs.350,000 to Rs. 105,000. Moreover, eye lenses are offered free of charge, while a cancer patient is treated without any monetary limits. Earlier, a cancer patient was allocated only Rs.1.5 million and thereafter, the patient had to choose between bearing the additional expenses or death. As a result of passing laws to display pictorial warnings on cigarette packets, it is observed that there has been a signficant drop in the number of smokers," the President said.
These are a few of the significant achievements in the country's health sector after 2015, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena further added that the present government was able to implement the Prof. Senaka Bibiles drug policy 45 years after its introduction.
As a former Health Minister, I tried to implement Prof. Senaka Bibiles Drug Policy, but the draft of the drug policy was misplaced at the Legal Draftsmans Department, the President said.
The President added that he faced many difficulties when trying to implement the 80 percent pictorial warning on cigarette packets in 2012.
The then Head of State threw away my Cabinet Paper to display 80 per cent pictorial warning on packets of cigarettes saying that no foreigner would come to the country, if they couldnt smoke a cigarette, the President said. President Sirisena added that real democracy is being exercised at the Cabinet meetings now.
The Ministers are allowed to freely debate the Cabinet Papers, unlike the previous regime.
The President said that he felt really happy after hearing that Minister Senaratne was appointed to the post of World Health Organisation Vice Chairman.
President Sirisena added that when Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva was once elected as the Chairman of World Health Organisation, the then Head of State never felicitated him or uttered a single word to encourage him.

Home treatments for cracked heels
1.Heel balms or thick moisturizers
The first line of treatment for cracked heels is using a heel balm. These balms contain ingredients to moisturize, soften, and exfoliate dead skin. Look out for the following ingredients:
urea (Flexitol Heel Balm)
salicylic acid (Kerasal)
alpha-hydroxy acids (Amlactin)
saccharide isomerate
You can find these heel balms over the counter at a drug store or online.
Tips for treating cracked heels :
*Apply heel balm in the morning to increase skin elasticity before you start your day
*Moisturize your heel two to three times a day wear shoes that protect your heel. Some heel balms may cause minor stinging or irritation. This is normal. Consult your doctor if the balm continues to bother you or causes severe reactions. Severe cases of cracked heels may require a prescription-strength balm or steroid cream to help reduce inflammation and relieve itching.
2. Soak and exfoliate your feet
The skin around cracked heels is often thicker and drier than the rest of your skin. This skin tends to split when you apply pressure. Soaking and moisturizing your feet can help with this. Here are some tips.
For a foot soak:
Keep your feet in lukewarm, soapy water for up to 20 minutes.
Use a loofah, foot scrubber, or pumice stone to remove any hard, thick skin.
Gently pat your feet dry.
Apply a heel balm or thick moisturizer to the affected area.
Apply petroleum jelly over your feet to lock in moisture. Put on socks to avoid spreading any grease around.
Avoid scrubbing your feet when theyre dry. This increases your risk for damaged skin.
You can also try moisturizing heel sleeves. These have a similar effect to foot soaks. The sleeves are like socks that contain therapeutic oils and vitamins to help treat your dry skin.
3.Liquid bandage
You can also apply liquid bandage to cracks to seal the wound and prevent infections or further cracking. This product comes as a spray, which means you can go about your day without worrying about the bandage coming off. Liquid bandage is a good option for treating deep heel cracks that may bleed.
Apply liquid bandage to clean, dry skin. As the crack heals, the coating is forced to the skins surface.
4.Honey
Honey may work as a natural remedy for cracked heels. According to a 2012 review, honey has antimicrobial and antibacterial properties. Research shows that honey can help heal and cleanse wounds, and moisturize the skin. You can use honey as a foot scrub after a soak, or apply it as a foot mask overnight.

Trail five-match series 2-0:
Lankas ODI fortunes dip further with another loss
DAMBULLA, Wednesday: Sri Lankas dip in fortunes in the one-day game continued when they lost the second ODI to South Africa by four wickets at the Rangiri Dambulla Stadium yesterday to trail the five-match series 2-0.
Despite an improved batting performance compared to the first when they were shot out for 193, the Lankan bowling could not sustain the South African batting that chased down their total of 244-8 to win with 43 balls to spare.
With the pitches prepared for the ODI series not so conducive to spin as it was in the Tests, South Africas batsmen have found out a way of tackling the Lankan spinners as has been proved in the two ODIs played so far.
They have successfully chased down totals of 194 and 245 and look a much confident side than they were during the Test series.
Sri Lanka had only themselves to blame for failing to exert pressure on the South African batting when both openers Quinton de Kock and Hashim Amla were let off early in their innings.
Kusal Perera put down a sitter at square leg off Amla when he was on four and Akila Dananjaya made a mess of a catch hit straight to him at midwicket by De Kock with his score on 18. On both occasions the unfortunate bowler was ODI debutant Kasun Rajitha. He later picked up his maiden ODI wicket when he had De Kock caught at mid wicket later in the innings.
The two openers made Sri Lanka pay dearly for the lapses by putting together a stand of 91 off 84 balls that laid the platform for South Africas win.
Amla not at his best form scored a run a ball 43 and de Kock hit 13 fours and a six in an aggressive knock of 87 off 78 balls to take the Man of the Match award.
Although Akila Dananjaya picked up three wickets that of Amla, Aiden Markram (3) and Faf du Plessis (49) South Africa paced out their run chase nicely to romp home easy winners.
It seemed that Sri Lanka had not learnt their lessons from the first ODI when they lost Upul Tharanga (9) and Kusal Mendis (0) to Nigidi to be 13-2 in the second over. However Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Perera saw off the opening pair of bowlers Rabada and Ngidi. But Perera who top scored with 81 in the first ODI fell with his score on 12 failing to time a pull off Phehelukwayo that ended up in mid-ons hands.
Dickwella and Angelo Mathews set about giving the innings some substance with a stand of 67 off 81 balls but South Africa never allowed Sri Lanka to run away with the run rate which was kept hovering around 4 1/2 an over.
The fact that only Mathews and Dickwella made fifties and the next highest score was 19 tells a tale how the South African bowlers controlled the innings.
Dickwella dealt a painful blow on his right ribs off a delivery from Mulder at 31 carried on after receiving some treatment on the field but later while keeping wickets during the South African innings he was forced to leave the field unable to move his right arm. Kusal Perera took over duties as wicket-keeper.
Dickwella batted aggressively to score 69 off 78 balls (10 fours)  his first half century in 16 innings the last one being scored at the same venue against India in August 2016.
Mathews who came to the wicket at 57-3 played a sheet anchor role to hold the innings together.
Apart from a stand of 42 with Shehan Jayasuriya (18) he could not find anyone to stay with him long enough.
When the innings ended he was unbeaten on 79 scored off 111 balls (6 fours) having passed 3000 ODI runs as captain.Du Plessis used his bowlers judiciously in short spells with Ngidi and Phehelukwayo ending up taking three wickets apiece.
Two Lankan bowlers achieved personal milestones during the South African innings with Kusal Mendis contributing to both of them with catches.
Thisara Perera became the ninth Sri Lankan bowler to take 150th ODI wickets when he dismissed JP Duminy for 32 and Suranga Lakmal captured his 100th ODI wicket with the dismissal of David Miller for 3 to become the 17th Sri Lankan bowler.
He series now moves to Pallekele for the third and fourth ODIs scheduled for August 5 and 8.

## Title: Launching of National Census Report on Early Childhood Development Centers
## Supertitle:

Launching of National Census Report on Early Childhood Development Centers
Early Childhood Development (ECD) is the centre point of Human Development. In Sri Lanka, the period from conception to 5 years of age is considered as the Early Childhood. In Sri Lankan context, the Early Childhood services can be categorized into two junctures; the first category of services are centred around the Childs Home where the child is provided with protection and shelter by parents during 0  3 years of age and the second category of services are based around Early Childhood Development Centers for Children aged 3  5 years.
Investments made in developing Early Childhood contribute to the progression of Human Capital in two main forms. The first is building a sound foundation for primary education, and the second is creating fulfilled citizens and advancing human resource of the country through eradication of disparities in education opportunities by providing standard facilities for children from low-income backgrounds from very early stages in their lives.
Based on the gaps identified by the 2014 study on the importance of Early Childhood sector and the Early Childhood Development context of Sri Lanka, the Sri Lankan government with financial support and in agreement with the World Bank, Initiated the Early Childhood Development project in 2016 to upscale the quality and making Early Childhood services easily accessible for everyone.
Key objectives
The project is being implemented by the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs and is planned to run through a 5 years time period. Non-existence of similar large-scale projects for ECD in whole South Asia places our Sri Lankan project in a special spot. This has become a great opportunity for the betterment and upscaling of the Early Childhood sector of the country.
The key objectives of the project are to upscale the quality of existing ECD services and making them easily and equally accessible for everyone. Quality management, expansion of available ECD facilities, provision of learning and teaching materials, training of ECD teachers and teaching assistants, Training of Trainers, and ECD Centers based health and nutrition programmes are currently implemented and ongoing under the project, explained the Project Director Dr. Ravi Nanayakkara.
Pre-school/Montessori children aged between 3-5 years and children aged between 0-5 years from the estate sector daycare centres are the direct beneficiaries of the project. The indirect beneficiaries include ECD teachers and teaching assistants, teacher trainers, ECD administrators, the ECD Centers supported by the project and the families of the children attached to these centres.
When implementing a national level, large-scale project; availability of up to date, reliable information on the relevant subject field is a necessity that cannot be overlooked. At the inception of the project, the only available accredited data on ECD Centers of Sri Lanka was from a 2010 Survey, and thus in 2016, the project had to kick off by conducting a national census of island-wide ECD Centers and Pre-schools. The project activities are based on the primary data derived from this census.
If Early Childhood Development is to progress as a discipline, its essential to identify the contradictions prevalence within the sector and come up with suitable remedies to address them. The census provided a mirror to the practical challenges of the ECD sector in Sri Lanka is facing and highlighted its problematic areas. The utmost importance of equally developing spiritual attributes along with physical attributes of development was among the mostly highlighted factors.
Future leaders
There are several central objectives of the national ECD Census conducted; to gain a clear understanding of the ECD sector in Sri Lanka, to elevate the admissions of children to ECD Centers, enhance the service quality of island-wide ECD Centers, and distribution of human resources for easy accessibility of everyone.
Using the main data gathered through the census on ECD Centers, a database is established. A wide range of information and data such as the district and provincial wise distribution of ECD Centers, variations among the centres, their administrative structures, ownership, registration details, resources contribution, the drinking water hygiene, and health facilities etc. have been collected through the census along with sound understanding of the current learning and teaching environment of the ECD Centers. Based on the national database information, the physical, and psychosocial human needs and facilities for early childhood aged children can be advanced productively.
In this process, the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs lead by Minister, ECD Project Team, Childrens Secretariat, Department of Census and Statistics and the World Bank worked together hand in hand.
The commitment and support of the team of over 600 government officials (ECD officers/Child Rights Development Officers, Census Officers) at divisional, district and provincial level lead by the officials of Department of Census and Statistics were core in making this process a success. On this day of launching the National Census report making all that effort behind this process count, the key aspiration of the Ministry of Women and Child Affairs along with the ECD Project Team is to see all stakeholders involved in the Early Childhood Development sector making productive use of these data available in the database to enhance and elevate ECD discipline through their work.
The national responsibility of paving the way for the buddying little future leaders of tomorrow is now opened.
Invest in the future of our little daughters and sons prior to anything else. Invest wisely, and invest in all children. Do it because its an unmeasurable investment for the future.

LOLC supports Conservation of Lankan Leopard
Having recognised the importance of high quality research in protecting the endangered Sri Lankan Leopard, LOLC, one of Sri Lankas leading and largest diversified conglomerates has stepped forward to support the Standardised Population Survey of the Sri Lankan Leopard in the Wilpattu National Park.
This 6-month project is spearheaded by the Environmental Foundation Limited, the Department of Wildlife Conservation of Sri Lanka, and For The Leopard Trust. The cheque to fund the project was handed over to the Environmental Foundation Ltd. at the LOLC Head Office in Rajagiriya, recently.
The Leopard is one of the five species of Big Cats in the world along with the Tiger, Lion, Jaguar and the Snow Leopard. Only nine subspecies of Leopards including the Sri Lankan Leopard Panthera pardus kotiya have been recognized in the world and our Leopard, is the second remaining island Leopard in the world. This unique big cat is our apex predator and is categorised as an endangered species by the IUCN (The International Union for Conservation of Nature) primarily due to loss of habitat.
Furthermore, Sri Lankas national parks are listed amongst the worlds best places to observe Leopards.
Speaking about the project, Dr. Eric Wikramanayake, Principal Investigator and Chairman of the Environmental Foundation Limited said, This survey at Wilpattu will provide the first robust and scientifically defensible estimates of Leopards in Wilpattu, after which we hope to continue this survey in other major protected areas of Sri Lanka. The data will establish a reliable baseline to inform long-term population monitoring and conservation programs. The objective of this survey is to estimate Leopard densities using Leopard photographic data which will be used in spatially explicit capturerecapture analysis (SECR) in the Wilpattu National Park.
The methodology used for this population survey is an internationally accepted protocol that uses two systematically set up camera traps. The camera traps, spaced about 2-3 kilometres apart, will be left active for a period of 40 days and checked regularly.
Dr. Wikramanayake added, We are immensely encouraged by our partnership with LOLC. It will reinforce our conservation efforts and ensure that such iconic species are not affected along Sri Lankas journey towards economic progress and development. Corporate partners like LOLC have recognised the importance of protecting Sri Lankas wildlife and we are pleased to work closely with corporates who have understood the essence of wildlife conservation.
Dinal Samarasinghe who is leading the field work noted that Phase 1 of the camera trapping programme covering the Eastern section of the Wilpattu National Park has been completed.
Speaking about the Population Survey of the Sri Lankan Leopard in the Wilpattu National Park, the Group Managing Director/ CEO of the LOLC Group, Kapila Jayawardena stated, LOLC is extremely happy to support this project which is of great national significance. We are proud to partner and support the efforts of the Environmental Foundation and the Department of Wildlife Conservation to protect endangered species such as the majestic and iconic Sri Lankan Leopard. We understand that these conservation efforts require adequate financing and it is not the sole responsibility of conservation organisations such as the EFL.
That is why we stepped forward to support such important projects which aims to protect and conserve Sri Lankas wildlife. We as a corporate will continue to engage in similar conservation efforts that focus on creating a sustainable ecosystem for both people and wildlife.
Kithsiri Gunawardena, Chief Operating Officer of the LOLC Group said, As an avid Leopard enthusiast engaged in the study of Leopards in Wilpattu, in my spare time, today Im extremely pleased and proud that we are supporting this project spearheaded by EFL and the Department of Wildlife Conservation and look forward to even better measures being taken to ensure the long term conservation of Leopards in the country. LOLC is quite conscious of the value of our unique bio diversity and the important role the corporate sector can play in supporting conservation.

Nepal lose maiden ODI to Dutch  after heartbreaking collapse
Amstelveen, Wednesday: Nepal suffered a dramatic collapse when they lost nine wickets for just 49 runs to go down to a 55-run defeat to the Netherlands in their maiden one-day international on Wednesday.
Chasing a modest 190 to win, Nepal, playing their first 50-over game since securing ODI status earlier this year, were bowled out for 134 with more than eight overs to spare.
Nepal had got off to a flying start in their run chase.
They looked comfortable at 85-1 before they slipped quickly to 104-6 and with most of their stroke makers back in the pavilion.
Opening batsman Gyanendra Malla hit 51 off 61 balls with eight fours and enjoyed a first-wicket stand of 58 with teenage wicketkeeper Anil Sah (21). But once skipper Paras Khadka became the second wicket to fall and Malla was then dismissed by South African-born all-rounder Michael Rippon, Nepal's challenge petered out.
Dipendra Singh Airee (33) was the only other Nepalese batsman to reach double figures. For the Dutch, playing their first ODI in four years after losing their one-day status, seamer Fred Klaassen took 3-30, leg-spinner Rippon finished with 3-23 while orthodox slow bowler and skipper Pieter Seelaar claimed a miserly 3-16.
Earlier, Rippon had top-scored for the Dutch with 51 while Khadka claimed the best bowling for Nepal, leading from the front with 4-26.
Sompal Kami took 3-34.
The second and final match of the series will be staged at the same venue on Friday. AFP

Presidential Commission probing SriLankan
New evidence on  misappropriation of shares
It was revealed before the Presidential Commission on SriLankan Airlines (SLA), that the SLA director board had instructed to provide USD 53-million worth shares that belonged to Emirates Airlines, to several state banks and funds, contrary to the Cabinet decision to provide them solely to the Bank of Ceylon (BOC) in 2010.
According to the evidence provided by SriLankan Airlines Secretary Dalreen Thirukumar, the shares were given to the BOC, Peoples Bank, National Savings Bank (NSB) and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF). She said the director board decided to provide USD 12-million worth shares to the BOC, USD 4 million to the People's Bank, USD 4 million to NSB, and USD 1 million to the EPF.
According to the witness, Nishantha Wickremesinghe was the SLA Chairman at the time the decision was taken. She said she was appointed secretary in 2013.
The Commission instructed her to submit the relevant documents related to the decision, next Monday (6). Additional Solicitor-General Neil Unambuwa led the evidence. The evidence revealed that the Government Chief Valuer had valued 51.01 percent of shares owned by SriLankan Airlines worth USD 440 million, while no valuation had been done on Emirates Airlines' shares.
The Emirates Airlines chairman had informed then Treasury Secretary P. B. Jayasundara on February 23, 2010, that Emirates would sell the shares in SriLankan Airlines. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the then Finance Minister.

One Galle Face Supports 'NO KUNU' campaign
The One Galle Face together with the No Kunu campaign team recently participated in cleaning the surrounding areas of the Beira Lake. The campaign was initiated by retired engineer and activist for sustainable solutions, Sumi Moonesinghe in collaboration with the Gangaramaya Buddhist Temple.
On Saturday (21) the Galle Face Green and the surrounding area was allocated by the No Kunu movement for the staff of One Galle Face for cleaning purposes. Starting in the morning, by noon several bags of garbage were collected. Other reputed organizations located in the vicinity contributed towards cleaning of an area of 12 km leading up to the Beira Lake.
Speaking about the campaign General Manager, Shangri-La Hotels Lanka (Pvt) Ltd, Callie Yah said, maintaining an unpolluted environment is important. This is a good initiative, which should be carried forward. I want to thank the No Kunu team for giving us this opportunity and the staff of One Galle Face and all other organizations who participated in this initiative, she concluded.
The garbage crisis over the years has increased largely in the country, affecting lives on a daily basis. Oceans and lakes are polluted with plastic and toxic waste, causing harm to marine life and humans. Years to come if preventive measures arent taken the adversities will be severe and too late to find a solution.

Parents could take legal action if trained teachers not provided - PM
Parents could take legal action against the Education Ministry if trained teachers are not provided to schools in future, the Prime Minister said.
Parents will be given the right to obtain the services of trained teachers to schools attended by their children in future. If any future government failed to fulfil this obligation, parents would also have the right to go before courts and obtain the redress by recourse to the law of the land, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister was addressing a meeting after opening a new building complex at Gintota Zahira Vidyalaya in Galle on July 30.
As much as buildings and equipment, trained teachers are also essential to develop a school. Training is a quintessential factor for ensuring a proper service to the people whether it be at a hospital, school or any public utility, the Prime Minister said.
He said that during his tenure as Education Minister, he decided to provide training to all teachers and set up Colleges of Education to recruit and train teachers systematically by a process of selecting the teacher trainees.
This was implemented in 1985 and 86 on the lines of the education system in countries such as Thailand and Malaysia. This system he introduced to provide trained teachers to all schools was subsequently politicised causing great harm to education.
As a result, a large number of untrained teachers are now serving in the school system today. But these teachers could not be blamed for this sorry situation as their appeals for training facilities went unheeded by the previous regime.
The Prime Minister said during discussions held with Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, they decided to fulfil the pledges held out to the people regarding education.
Recruitment of teachers would not be handed over to politicians. Instead, legal provisions would be made to ensure quality education.The burden of maintaining a high standard of education in schools would be vested in Principals. Only trained teachers could be recruited to schools within the next five years. The government would make the recruitment of teacher groups two to three years in advance and provide training so as to assign them to schools. If these provisions by law are not adhered to, parents would be given the right to petition courts and obtain a ruling against any politician involved or the Education Ministry itself. Unless these provisions were made available the trained teacher recruitment programme will not succeed, he said.
These laws and regulations implemented in the UK and New Zealand have been made available to the Education Ministry to formulate its own set of regulations.
After the local regulations were formulated they would be forwarded to the President and the Cabinet for approval before enacting them.
Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Parliamentarian Wijayapala Hettiarachchi and several other politicians and state officials were present.

PM opens Le Grand in Galle
The government has given priority to develop the tourism industry which can bring valuable foreign exchange in to the country. Galle has been recognised as a key area for extensive development, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Speaking at the opening of the Le Grand Galle by Asia Leisure and with Belluna Co. Ltd, Japan at Kaluwella Galle on Tuesday, the Prime Minister said the Galle region will also be transformed as a pre-eminent hub of sports activities in Asia.
Le Grand is the sixth leisure project which comes under the Asia Leisure and Belluna Co. Ltd group and the total investment for the current project is US$ 20 million. The hotel consists of 50 luxury rooms and seven grand suites.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said, the Southern Expressway and the Mattala Airport too would be used to develop Southern Tourism in the future. We are in the process of identifying fitting locations for the construction of new tourist hotels islandwide.
The vast area that comes under the Southern Tourism project includes Bentota, Ahungalla and Kosgoda. We also have plans to establish three tourism regions in the Southern Province, the Premier said.
We are planning to transform Galle into a hub of sports activities in the region and a second stadium in Galle is also considered. There are also plans to develop this region under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme of the government, the Prime Minister said.
Asia Leisure operates a number of luxury leisure properties including Shingawa Beach in Balapitiya, Tamarind Hill in Galle, Taprobana in Wadduwa, The River House in Balapitiya and its latest addition is The Habitat in Kosgoda. Belluna Co. Ltd, Japan is listed on the Tokyo Stock Exchange (TSE), First Section, with a market capitalization of over USD 800 million.

Presidential Secretariat to intervene in drinking water projects
President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the Presidential Secretariat to intervene in the commencement of the new drinking water projects, as well as to find suitable water sources for the implementation of water schemes.
Simultaneously, the World Bank had agreed to offer financial and technical aid, while conducting a systematic water balance study concerning 10 major river basins in the country such as the Malwathu Oya, Kala Oya; Kelani, Mahaweli, Walawe and Kalu rivers; the Deduru Oya as well as the Nilwala and Gin rivers and the Ma Oya, for arranging a database to enable the preparation of a master plan on the availability of drinking, irrigation and industrial water, parallel to the overall development boom.
Under the study, changes in rainfall patterns, protection of cascade networks and water sources, maximum water intake for drinking water projects, preparation of future drinking water sharing mechanisms and identifying water-management options, including any new water resources required with proposed catchment management measures for river basins in order to meet future water demands within the 10 river basins, would be scrutinised.
Specifically, the proposed World Bank-funded, detailed water balance study for the 10 river basins, would provide due consideration to present and future (predicted) demands of all water users, including ecological demands, a spokesman attached to the Irrigation Department's Water Management and Training Unit told the Daily News.
It had also been agreed to hold a water balance study for the Kala Oya basin, which would be coordinated by Irrigation Department Water Management and Training Unit Director of Engineer Wasantha Palugaswewa.
The Kala Oya is the third longest river in the country, which is around 145km in length, covering an area of 2,870 square-kilometres. The overall objective of the water balance study for the Kala Oya, was to review the present status of water availability in the river basin and thereby, decide the possibility of extracting 300 cubic metres of water per day, to fulfil the water supply demand in the Eppawala, Rajangane, Nochchiyagama, Giribawa and Thambuttegama water supply schemes, without compromising the water requirement of other water users, the spokesman added.
However, the proposed Kala Oya basin water balance study is yet to commence since response by the main stakeholders, namely the National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) and the Sri Lanka Mahaweli Authority, the main users of the river basin, is slow.
It had also been decided to acquire water for the Anuradhapura North and Trincomalee-integrated mega water supply scheme from the Yan Oya reservoir that is currently being constructed in the Horowpothana and Gomarankadawala District Secretariat divisions. With regard to the Galenbinunuwewa water project, the Hurulu Wewa was proposed to be the main water source, whereas the Habarana tank is being used as the water source for the Palugaswewa water project.
It was learnt that no water source had been found to cater to the Galgamuwa water project, while the Siyabankotuwa tank had been proposed as a water source for the Puttalam City (South) water scheme.
Regarding the Mahawilachchiya water project, steps are being taken to renovate the Kudawilavchchiya tank located at the Wilpattu National Park at a cost of Rs.250 million, and the Environmental and Archaeological Impact Study reports are pending.

Rice to breakfast!
It is vital to get your children in the habit of eating a healthy breakfast. Breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Studies show that children who have breakfast tend to eat healthier overall and are more likely to participate in physical activities which helps in maintaining a healthy body weight. Breakfast gives the body the refueling it needs for the day ahead after going without food for eight to 10 hours during sleep.
Having breakfast is important for everyone especially for children. In general, children who skip breakfast will feel tired, restless and irritable. What they have for breakfast is equally important as well. Choosing breakfast foods that are rich in whole grains, fiber and protein while low in added sugar may enhance the attention span, concentration and memorywhich children need to learn in school.
Children who eat a healthful, well-balanced breakfast are more likely to:
*Meet their daily nutrient requirements
*Concentrate better
*Have better problem-solving skills
*Have better hand-eye coordination
*Stay alert
*Be more creative
*Miss fewer days of school
*Be more physically active

Without breakfast, our bodies dont get the proper start they need to operate at their fullest potential throughout the day. Encourage your children to make breakfast a part of their regular household routines. By helping children learn important concepts about eating breakfast, it will lay a foundation of eating right for years to come.
*If young children learn important concepts about eating breakfast it will lay a foundation of eating right for years to come.
*Children who skip breakfast are less focused and alert and often too tired to complete morning tasks.
*Children who are hungry experience more learning difficulties as compared to well-nourished children.

## Title: RISE OF THE MODERN STATE
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, August 2, 2018 - 01:00
RISE OF THE MODERN STATE
The notion of the state has been examined and clarified from the time of Plato and Aristotle. Caesar acknowledged his indebtedness to Plato in stating what a state should be. Ciceros idea that the State is the affair or property of the people, and its mission is to be a community, a community of subordinate autonomous communities, a commonwealth for ethical purposes; if it fails in its mission, it is nothing. From then onwards while ideas regarding the state have developed, Ciceros has persisted even to date. The idea that prior to the State are the people who are sovereign is from the Jesuit Cardinal Robert Bellarmino (1542-1621) and it has found its way to the constitution of the United States of America.
Ideas that surfaced subsequent to the former ideas may not have been progressive enough to have developed coherently and may not have been true, just and fair, communitarian and liberating in accord with human dignity and worth. Even ideas only partially true and just have many decades been made persuasive and even plausible to many until they were found wanting and discarded when they caused irreparable harm to the community by distorting relationships and the life of the people. Some have traversed the rights of the community and imposed their personal idea of the state and abused power.
The state is an agency of a community of people. A community is dynamic and has the potential to grow so that all citizens, especially those in public service, according to each ones position and capacity, show individually and socially responsible. In our context the community of the citizens of Sri Lanka is a nation community claiming a common territory within definite borders.
This agency organises itself to attend to various functions to serve the community while recognizing certain basic natural and human laws as their legitimate foundation. Based on them the state legislature enacts further laws not for their own sake but to achieve various definite ends and it enforces them for the benefit of the common good. The State is sovereign and yet makes itself and all citizens subject to the law. It is necessary to have an accurate understanding of the state that it may be invested with just and proportionate jurisdictions demarcated by the will of citizens that the citizens may expect integrity in its operations. Even a majority of citizens does not have the power to vest the legislature or any figure of state an excessive and unlimited power. It is therefore quite foolish for anyone to lay claim to such power under any pretext.
INTEGRITY AND STATE AUTHORITY
Citizens are both subject to the State and dependent on the State and are sovereign. They are not owned by the State like slaves. (People, however, individually and collectively could become slaves of drinking, gambling, sexual depravity and forms of corruption and political ideologies leading them to distorted reasoning). People do not belong to the State but the State belongs to the community of people. And the people is not a mere gathering of human beings brought together anyhow but a mass associated in a covenant, an agreement with respect to natural law, truth, freedom, equality and justice and a partnership for the common good.
Above and beyond but enveloping every community is the community of rational minds that could communicate. A good upbringing and a wholesome education sustain the rationality of a people and enable them to communicate ideas to one another. The most important things that could be and should be systematically communicated for the healthy social upkeep of society are values, values that endure, rather than transient sentiments or feelings. Governments and state apparatus, that direct its administration with authority, should consist of men and women known for their integrity of character and their ability to communicate and serve by upholding values: truth, justice and fairness, freedom and equality in the relationships among the people.
PRINCIPLE OF SUBSIDIARITY
Citizens have from time immemorial have freely associated themselves in other groupings and communities and take initiatives to serve themselves in common without prejudice to the well-being of other communities, before state institutionalization of common affairs. Patient persistence is a quality of private initiative. When the rulers do not take cognizance of this principle, they unnecessarily complicate matters of governance as happens in Sri Lanka. State interventions should not hamper private initiative. The principle of subsidiarity accomplishes at a lower and local level that which does not need close attention and interference at a higher level.
It is the function of the State to administer the well-being of all equally and justly. It is therefore quite improper for a temporary holder of state office to obstruct all private initiative and centralize power around himself as the power holder. Further, it is improper and unethical for politicians in power to use the resources and finances of the State to institutionalize services and provide various public facilities and amenities for the people and pretend to be a generous benefactor or a philanthropist of the people as if he has unstintingly pocketed out his own private money for them. Sri Lankas uncouth politicians hijack public properties and the donations of philanthropists and name it after themselves after using peoples money to build an enclosure wall around the philanthropists property!
It is honour enough for a politically involved social worker to be recognized as an honest person whose interventions provide social benefits for the public community. Anything beyond that is the display of immature politics of puerile, grungy and selfish minds. However, grateful succeeding generations, not family members, recognize the social contributions of notable citizens and immortalize their memory after their death.
OUTLANDISH IDEAS OF STATE UNDEMOCRATIC
True, just, right and fair ideas are important as they influence the right understanding of not only of the state but also of grass roots politics and political ideologies. Perverse and stiff-necked understanding of the State could lead to dictatorial attitudes that eat into civic life. Outlandish ideas are not only proclaimed in our midst as new visions and easy solutions to complex problems, outlandish decisions of short-sighted politicians are promoted as state policy. When such policies are adopted and get stratified over the years they lead the nation to disorder and stagnancy.
Outlandish ideas may even reverberate even beyond our borders even though such broadcasters are quite unaware that they are articulating and formulating crude and makeshift forms of state. Those giving expression to their bizarre notions about what they plan to do with the sub-agencies of the state are indeed puerile because they are incapable of understanding human nature with its potentiality for greatness and heroism as well as its capacity to indifference and lethargy and even descending to the basest levels of depravity, immorality, wickedness and malevolence.
They are also unaware that through force and compulsion they are already sowing seeds of enmity and showing forth the face of evil that is to come. They could never motivate and inspire people to reach beyond themselves to exceptional human deeds of high quality for the sake of others.
Nevertheless, ignorant as they are, lacking knowledge and understanding of principles of democracy and social responsibility, they broadcast their threatening and retrograde ideas widely and do not care about the heritage of civilization, cultural refinement and the progress of human freedom, human solidarity and fraternity and community advancement that have been brought about not only by the progress of human thought but also at great cost to many members of the universal human family in its history.
In Sri Lanka due to ignorance, lack of knowledge and understanding as well as superficial and crass social attitudes among the raw political green-horns with fascist tendencies, unacceptable and undemocratic and anti-social views on the state, governance and politics surface intermittently now and then. They hold on to a perverted theory of state in which autocratic rule turns the law into their personal whim imposed on others. These need to be subject to thorough criticism and investigation and debunked and rapacious politicians exposed.
The movements that present to the people the right ideas of the State and government should find support among the people that democracy, the dignity of people and their freedom may be saved.

Root quickest to 6,000 Test runs in terms of time
Birmingham, Wednesday: England captain Joe Root became the quickest batsman to 6,000 Test runs in terms of time from his debut when he reached the landmark on the first day of the series opener against India at Edgbaston on Wednesday.
A streaky four off spinner Ravichandran Ashwin saw the 27-year-old Root, in his 127th Test innings, to the 40 runs he had needed to reach 6,000.
It meant Root, who won the toss, had got to the landmark in five years and 231 days of his Test career, surpassing former England captain Alastair Cooks mark of five years and 339 days.
It is perhaps unsurprising that two England batsmen are at the top of this list given how much Test cricket their side plays, with Wednesdays match their 1,000th fixture at this level.
To put Roots achievement into perspective, Donald Bradman remains the quickest batsman to 6,000 Test runs in terms of innings, the Australia great needing just 68 knocks to achieve the feat.
Yet such were the infrequency of Test matches, then played by far fewer countries, it took Bradman more than 19 years to appear in the 45 Tests that yielded those 68 innings. AFP

Root was on 80 when he and Jonny Bairstow opted for a second run, only for Virat Kohlis direct hit to beat the dive of the England captain.
From there, England lost four wickets for 27 runs and eventually limped to 285-9.
Earlier, they looked to be taking advantage of winning the toss on a surface that seems true for batting, but is also offering some encouragement to both pace and spin bowlers.
Root shared stands of 72 with Keaton Jennings, who made a watchful 42, and 104 with Bairstow, whose 70 was the most fluent batting of the day.
But, after Root and Bairstow were removed, India off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin tormented England to end with 4-60.
It left England in a disappointing position on the first day of their 1,000th Test, played in front of a ground that was no more than three-quarters full.
The crowd was subdued until it was brought to life by Englands struggle, with some of the biggest cheers reserved for number 11 James Anderson blocking the hosts towards the close.
For two sessions this was a hard-fought day, one that bodes well for the competitiveness of the remainder of the five-Test series. England showed patience against the moving ball and later, when Bairstow and Root were scoring at four and a half runs an over, the home side were taking control at 215-3.
However, it was Englands eagerness which began Indias resurgence.
Bairstow played Ashwin to mid-wicket and came back for a second that never looked viable. A sliding Kohli gathered and threw off-balance, the ball hitting the non-strikers stumps with the desperate Root well short.
As Bairstow dropped to his haunches and Root stomped off, skipper Kohli blew kisses to both batsmen, then put his finger to his lips and mimicked Roots mic drop celebration from Englands victory in the third one-day international.
Soon after, Bairstow chopped Umesh Yadav on to his own stumps, Jos Buttler was lbw to Ashwin and Ben Stokes somehow patted a return catch to the same bowler.
Sam Curran and the controversially recalled Adil Rashid briefly halted the tourists, only for Rashid to be lbw on review to Ishant Sharma before Stuart Broad was trapped leg before by Ashwin.
For so long, Root looked set to end a run that had seen him fail to convert any of his previous 10 half-centuries into hundreds.
The skipper patiently absorbed probing India bowling, tucking the ball off his pads or guiding it to third man.
In reaching 40, he became the third-youngest batsman, after Sachin Tendulkar and Alastair Cook, to reach 6,000 Test runs.
His half-century meant he had passed 50 in each of the 12 Tests he has played against India - no other player in the history of the game has made more than nine successive fifties against the same opposition.
During his stands with Jennings and Bairstow, Root was keen to rotate the strike, often holding out his hands and asking his partner for a single.
It was running, though, that proved his downfall.
India, the world number one side, have lost only one Test series since the beginning of 2015 but are looking for their first success in England since 2007.
Although captain Kohli said he was happy to lose the toss, his side were poor with the new ball, their wastefulness compounded when Ajinkya Rahane dropped Jennings at fourth slip when the opener had only nine.
Ashwin was introduced in only the seventh over of the day and turned the ball throughout, perhaps showing the error of both sides in opting for only one specialist spinner each.
Ashwin led the India improvement. Alastair Cook was bowled by a beautiful off-break that clipped the top of off stump and impressive pace bowler Mohammad Shami removed both Jennings and Dawid Malan.
India were forced to retreat when Bairstow was in full flow, but after Kohlis moment of magic the tourists took control in the evening sunshine.
They would have completed the job had diving wicketkeeper Dinesh Karthik not spilled Curran off Shami in the final over the day, leaving Curran unbeaten on 24. - BBC

Sanath Jayasuriya teaches his son the tricks of the trade
When one thinks Sri Lankan cricket, one thinks of Sanath Jayasuriya. In fact, such was the impact of the left-handed opener that he literally gave the term aggression a new meaning.
Having played a bevy of cricket in the opening position, Jayasuriyas world acclaim came when he redefined opening batting not just in ODIs, but also in Test matches.
The southpaw would eventually play 110 Test matches and 445 One-Day Internationals for his country, something that only the likes of Kumar Sangakkara and perhaps even Mahela Jayawardene have surpassed or equaled.
In recent times, age might have taken its toll on the Lankan legend, but that does not mean he has forgotten cricket altogether. Jayasuriya was seen helping his son out by giving him throw-downs in the nets.
In fact, the manner in which he was doing so was remarkable. However, more remarkable was the fact that his son was showcasing some of the old flair Jayasuriya had in the past.
The legendary Sri Lanka all-rounder scored 6973 runs in Tests while he piled up 13,430 runs in the ODI format. He was also a handy bowler when he helped himself to an impressive 323 wickets as well, something that made him a legend in every right.
It would be clear that his finest moment came in 1996 when he was one of the most impressive players in the World Cup, something that was his first and only World Cup win.
This was also something that saw the Island nation win their first and only World Cup title. However, in spite of all this, they have now slipped into a labyrinth of uncertainty, something that has seen them fall from grace quite badly as well.  Crictracker

Sarva Colombo spearheads  Cult Branding
Sarva Colombo recently concluded its recent Inspiration Session on Cult Branding The key to growth in tough economic times for clients, friends and members of the marcom community.
The session was led by Sharmila Cassim, the Chief Strategy Officer of Sarva Colombo, and used global and local case studies to demonstrate the principles of cult branding. The talk shed light on how cult branding can help the ultimate form of brand loyalty- cult-like devotion amongst their consumers.
When economic times are tough and the level of competition is intense, many marketers resort to price cuts and promotions.
This is detrimental for your brand as well as your brand value in the long run. This is why Cult Branding is crucial for Sri Lanka at this point in time, if brands expect to experience growth in tough economic times both now and well into the future.
According to the principles of cult branding as demonstrated by Sharmila, the seven rules that can help a brand inspire fierce loyalty and devotion in its consumers are the golden rules of differentiation, courage, fun, listening, tribal imperative, openness and freedom.
Sharmila noted, The rules of tribal imperative, openness and freedom are particularly important as they require aspiring cult brands to understand and cater to the higher level needs of consumers.
In order to accomplish this, at Sarva Colombo, we have sought the help of organisational/behavioural psychologist, Rozaine Cooray, to help develop strategies that take the psyche of consumers into account.
Speaking on cult branding in relation to an organisations employees, Sharmila demonstrated the importance of internal communication and culture transformation to make micro ambassadors of employees, using Lululemon Athletica as an example; a point that was reiterated by Managing Director Chrishantha Jayasinghe in relation to Sarva Colombos own culture transformation. Internal communication becomes more and more important every day as we are in the age of Micro Ambassadors, he explained, Where your people are going to be a key touch point in delivering your brand values.
Sarva Colombo, which recently celebrated its thirteenth anniversary, is reputed for effective growth-driven communications through strategies and insights based on research, many of which are conceptualised in Sinhala and Tamil. The agency continues to deliver exceptional results for high calibre brands in the banking and non-banking financial sector, and in the educational, telecommunications, medical, automobile and FMCG industries, respectively.
Backed by a passionate and talented team, Sarva Colombo maintains that effective advertising is the only advertising worth paying for.

Soul Stirring!

On an alley off of Kassapa Road, the Soul Sounds Academy is home to one of the most vivacious, precocious childrens groups in Sri Lanka: the Soul Sounds Childrens Choir. The Choir, which recently participated in the World Choir Games for the first time, won silver and bronze in the categories of Childrens Choir and Scenic Folklore. 
However, after winning their medals, the choir described their experience in terms other than victory. The children and their teachers said the process leading up to and participating in the Games was an opportunity for personal and professional growth.
The Soul Sounds Academy Childrens Choir was one of two choirs to represent Sri Lanka at the World Choir Games in Tshwane, South Africa, along with the Royal College Choir. The Soul Sounds Childrens Choir was directed by Amandhi Caldera, Dinushka Jayawickreme, and Soundarie David Rodrigo, Music Director of Soul Sounds Academy.
Rodrigo, who stayed for the full duration of the Games from July 4 to 14 as a judge, said that she was happy with the results, because the standards were really high. I think the South Africans have music in their body, soul, and blood. We were competing with a lot of South Africans, the Russians, and Chinese. Everybody was of a really high standard, so I think whatever Sri Lanka achieved was great in comparison.
Rodrigo said that, just to listen to them-I think it was a great learning experience.
The children regarded their time as a learning experience as well, we got a lot of experiences! they exclaimed in unison. The choir remarked upon the music they heard, the food they ate, and the friends they made.
16-year-old Hashinee Antonio said, The food was so good! and 13-year-old Khiara Premaratne said, I really like the food over there, especially the mushrooms and the hash browns.
My favourite memory of the Games, said 15-year-old Priyanka Amalean was making friends with other choirs.
Twelve-year-old Taalya Ramanayake remembers how After we did one of our songs, these kids from the other choir were smiling at us and waving.
The choristers were ebullient, remembering singing in South Africa. The group sang, not only during competitions, but on their journey, when their flights cabin crew found out that they were a choir, and again in a mall in South Africa. Another time after the Friendship Concert, they held a practice in the middle of the night, just because they were so energised by the performances they had heard.
The Soul Sounds Childrens Choir is a relatively new addition to the Soul Sounds Academy, and was formed only last year. The Academy held auditions for the Childrens Choir and picked the 33 most promising young vocalists. While the choir is open to everybody, it primarily consists of female members, and only four of the members of the childrens choir are boys. Members range from 9 to 17-years-old.
In 2017, the Childrens Choir won two golds in the Asia Pacific Games, which qualified them to compete in the World Choir Games. After the Asia Pacific Games, said 29-year-old choir director Amandhi Caldera,I was really really impressed, I heard some of them singing alone and I thought, wow, I didnt know they could sing like that.
The age difference amongst choristers can prove challenging from a teaching perspective, said Caldera.
Nine-year-olds tended to sing melodies, and older kids tended to sing parts. Generally, its the older ones who are better at holding parts. 17-year-old Sashya Abeyratne said that though it was hard to coordinate with them, the younger choristers, age never mattered to us, we are all one family.
Directing children, says Caldera, is a lot of stop talking, and be quiet. Theres a lot of forgetting sometimes. But in general, its really fun to work with kids also, and I think kids are very forgiving. They dont hold any grudges.
In addition to directing the Soul Sounds Childrens Choir, Caldera and co-directer Dinushka Jayawickreme work full-time jobs. Caldera is a psychologist, and commuted from Ragama to lead the choirs practices. At first, practices were no more than three hours, for once or twice a week. Occasionally, they would have a full-day practice on Sunday. But just before the competition, they held practice everyday. Despite the commitment it took from coaches and kids alike, it was really nice to work with the kids. I really enjoyed it, said Caldera.
You could see how much they improved over the six months that they practiced.
For the children, practice was always a delight, and they regarded their teachers as family members.
Aunty Soundarie is the best! Learning from her is just a gift that weve got from god. We are so proud to be her students, said 17-year-old Uvini Sirisena.
Amandhi, she continued is more like a mother, a sister, and a guardian angel at the same time. Dinushka-she is so sassy we love her.
Thirteen-year-old Akasha Abeyratne explained that, Here, in school, its more like family. You feel energy. Nobody judges you. You can be who you want to be.

Sri islanders, natural talent and good genetics
2018 strides through oblivious of all things normal...as Augustus stands tall.
Traditionally accepted as the month of change...it gives rugby7s in Sri Lanka the best shot ever.
Essentially the comprehensive Asian 7s season opens with the Asian Games, followed by the Asian series....plus some additional tours as prep for our ranking tournaments.
Both Sri islanders men and women, get their annual opportunity to stamp their class and scale that elusive ladder for positions that muscle up our performance profile regionally.
The required level of conditioning is professional and intense...and little room for any options that constitutes luck or destiny.
The national selection led by Rohan Abeykoon need all their experience and acumen to get the player combination absolutely on the button.
I am a firm believer in specialists. matching skills, temperament, vision and instincts is a real balance and trusted value for players to rely on .
Muthutanthri will need solid options both in attack and defence ...but most significantly, players that are prepared to empty their tanks for our island flag.
The pure steel belief is hard to find and rare as platinum.
Danushka Ranjan, Sooriyabandara, Ratwatte, Naveen Heenakan, Jason Dassa, Ritchie Dharmapala, Anu Vilivera, Hirantha P, Anuradha Herath, Omalka Gunaratne, Gayan Weeraratne ...should be familiar faces that step up off the page at selection....experience, pace, understanding and a few magical skills too.
The 7s championship is harsh as it is relentless...so much hope slapped on the considerable shoulders.
Management must be able to clearly define the composition of our squad...we require the ability to match or better the lineup.
Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, possibly Malaysia will be the set up all through the series.
We need to mentally and physically match up and counter our opponents in all departments, that really make us cutting edge in the middle.
I am sure our resident experts are chewing their manicured nails about Sri 7s ability to deliver under pressure this season.
Lets hope all the learning and meticulous work gives us dimension and venomous finishing.
The women will also be tested max ...and coach Sampath will need creative power to finish the job we started 5 years ago.
Japan, Hong Kong, Kazakhstan and Thailand stand between us and an elusive medal grab...its plenty history already, and time to deliver.
The required standard of clinical pace and finishing...Absolute priorities for team selection.
Ayesha Perry Perera, Randika Sambu, Sanju Wijeytilake, Anusha Attanayake, Munasinghe, Shani Madu, and the vast experience of Thanuja Weerakody ...fundamental to consistency this compulsive 2018.
Magical if they grab a medal when Sri Lanka Rugby host the final deciding leg in November.
Colombo 7s flagship arena ...the international Racecourse dressing up as our gracious host for the keenly anticipated ARFU season ender.
Grand news for new President Bonsa, deputy Dida Illyas and Nazeem Mohammed...to hit this 7s plan with gusto and pure belief.
Anything short of that is hard to absorb.
What a fabulous start for the new head executive committee at Sri Lanka Rugby to kick off their official ambitions.
Sevens U20, and U18 add to the scintillating possibilities this season....and not much doubt about being Asian champions again at both levels.
A repeat much desired and complete justice to our amazing and provocative natural schoolboy talent that makes our islanders paradise...phenomenal.
May Augustus herald and hail our best 7s season ever.
Be proud Sri rugby hearts ...its time to stamp our class in Asia.
Bula bula Sri Api!

The Special Task Force (STF) Wounded Warriors Association has decried a statement said to have been made by Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka labelling the Special Task Force as a lunatic asylum.
The association in a statement signed by its President T. P.K.S.Niranjana said Field Marshal Fonseka is an honourable person who should guide the nation and it was very unbecoming of an officer of his stature to make such irresponsible statements criticising a vital arm of the countrys defence establishment.
The STF has been a world renowned outfit which had won the peoples hearts by maintaining strict discipline. It had fought the war against the LTTE terrorists by rubbing shoulders with other Security Forces and also given leadership to quell riots and rebellions in the country. It is now being headed by a war veteran of the calibre of senior DIG M.R. Latheef. The outfit headed by him is a well disciplined force and is in quite contrast to a lunatic asylum, the statement said.

TOKYO SUPER + wins Green Mark Certification
TOKYO SUPER + Blended Hydraulic Cement from Tokyo Cement Company (Lanka) PLC., has won the Green Mark Certification from the Ceylon Institute of Builders, the apex professional body for the advancement of green building practices in Sri Lanka.
The award was presented at the CIOB Green Mark Awards Night held recently at the Ramada Hotel Colombo. The accreditation was made after careful evaluation of TOKYO SUPER + manufacturing process, quality and composition against the globally-acclaimed Green rating system by an expert technical panel of CIOB.
TOKYO SUPER + is a general-purpose cement complied with the Sri Lanka Standard Institutes SLS 1247:2015 Strength Class 42.5 N standard certification.
In addition, it also complies with EN Standard - BS EN 197-1: 2011 under type CEM IV/A (V) 42.5N  SR, the international strength class classification stipulated for higher strength and durability.
The product caters to emerging customer demands for more environmentally conscious products for a sustainable future. As the most sustainable cement produced in Sri Lanka, the use of Fly Ash in TOKYO SUPER + reduces CO2 emissions by over 25%.
Reducing its carbon footprint even further it is manufactured entirely using carbon-neutral, renewable biomass energy, making it the Greenest choice in market.
The real blended cement, made with Fly Ash and high quality Ordinary Portland Cement, creates a high-strength cementitious mortar that gets stronger as it ages and continues to gain strength even after 100 days, unlike other products in the market. Fly ash makes the blend smoother, improving workability while the homogeneous mix with more refined pores results indenser and compact concrete.
This also reduces the rise of temperature of the concrete and prevents thermal cracking, making it the best choice for mass concreting in high-rises. Having earned their trust TOKYO SUPER + has become the No.1 choice of construction professionals within a short span of time.
Furthermore, chemical composition of TOKYO SUPER + makes it ideally suited for harsh conditions such as marine or marshy environments, constructions underwater or on land prone to flooding, on soils containing higher levels of Sulphate or Chloride.
Its corrosive resistance capability prevents carbonation and protects steel reinforcements of buildings or slabs for life-long durability.This makes TOKYO SUPER + suited for a wide range of applications with greater utility.
The CIOB Green Mark accreditation programme promotes more environment-friendly sustainable built environments by working closely with the construction industry.
The Green Building Product certification scheme evaluates building products for their environmental impact and performance. It is an industry-recognised benchmark to assess green products in terms of; energy, water and resource efficiency, health and pollution control and other criteria such as Environmental Quality Management Systems (EQMS) and technical performance/innovation and includes a comprehensive life-cycle assessment to determine a products long-term impact on the environment.
Winning the Green Mark accreditation from CIOB for TOKYO SUPER + blended hydraulic cement reaffirms Tokyo Cement Groups commitment to differentiate as the most environmentally conscious manufacturer of cement and concrete in Sri Lanka.
Tokyo Cement also markets a range of innovative cement-based value-added solutions including plasters, flooring compounds, water proofers, and tile adhesives that improve construction efficiency and help conserve the environment.

UNDERSTANDING JAPAN ON BIG SCREEN
The Embassy of Japan and the Japan Foundation hosted their annual Japanese Film Festival at the National Film Corporation Theatre. The festival, which used to occur only sporadically, has emerged as a tradition for the Japanese Embassy. The festival featured a variety of contemporary Japanese cinema from comedy and drama to horror and anime, attracting viewers of all ages and backgrounds.
Having established their presence in past years, the fourth consecutive Japanese Film Festival strove to create a better understanding of Japan among Sri Lankans and deepen their interests in Japanese culture said Japanese Ambassador, Kenichi Suganuma at the festivals opening ceremony.
The Ambassador said, When you talk about Japanese movies you might think of Samurais but we shouldnt forget that young Japanese directors are directing wonderful movies. I am sure you will find new aspects of Japan and be even more fascinated by its culture.
Sri Lankan actress Umali Thillakaratne who studied film at Tokyos Ninon University, was the first Sri Lankan actress to land a starring role in a major Japanese film. We are here today to absorb the life and culture of Japanese people. What makes movies so important and the reason that we watch them is to understand oneself and others, said Thillakaratne.
The embassy kicked off the festival with the comedy, Golden Orchestra! about a high school teachers struggle to transform an aged and amateur community orchestra into a group of skilful musicians.
Its a really nice film. Its a very, very funny story, said Masaki Takaoka, in charge of public relations and cultural exchange affairs for the Japanese Embassy. The Golden Orchestra! as well as the others were screened in Japanese with English subtitles. For this kind of programme, said Takaoka, we dont do the local languages. But whenever we show TV programmes we dub them in the local languages.
Japanese Embassys Public Relations and Cultural Exchange Affairs Officer, Masaki Takaoka highlighted the Embassys cultural outreach programme on Sri Lankan television. For years now, Japanese TV programmes have been telecast on local Sri Lankan TV channels, available in both Sinhalese and Tamil.

## Title: Understanding the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA
## Supertitle:

Understanding the Sri Lanka-Singapore FTA
Sri Lanka and Singapore have recently signed a bilateral free trade agreement (SLSFTA). Apart from being a comprehensive and modern FTA in scope and coverage, the SLSFTA paves the way for Sri Lankas greater integration with ASEAN and possible future entry in RCEP. Reflecting on the challenges for optimising the benefits of SLSFTA, this paper argues a successful SLSFTA would vindicate the regions confidence in virtues of free trade.
While the global trade war threatens to disrupt the momentum of global trade and the prospects of global economic growth, encouraging signs of commitment to trade are visible elsewhere. Countries across the world continue to remain committed to free trade notwithstanding anxieties over the course of the trade war and its greater impact on global commerce. The EU and Japan have just signed a bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) paving the way for unrestricted trade within their combined economies of more than US$20 trillion. The growth of a preferential trading bloc between Europe and Asia, as represented by the EU-Japan FTA, would produce considerable energy for trade prospects in the Asia-Pacific. The prospects also stand to augment from another bilateral FTA that came into effect in May 2018  the Sri Lanka- Singapore FTA (SLSFTA).
Structure and Character
While economic size of the Singapore-Sri Lanka FTA is not comparable to that of the EU- Japan FTA, or any of the ASEAN +1 FTAs, it is notable for various reasons. It is Sri Lankas first FTA since 2005 and the most comprehensive among the handful it has signed so far. The FTA not only include traditional trade issues like trade in goods, trade remedies, trade facilitation and dispute settlement, but also covers trade in services, investments, intellectual property rights, government procurement, competition and e-commerce.1 In this respect, the FTA represents a modern 21st century FTA that includes not just traditional trade issues, but also those identified as WTO plus or extra issues  subjects like competition, investment, intellectual property and procurement  that have been found difficult to be taken forward at the WTO and are discussed by some ambitious FTAs including the Comprehensive and Progressive Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP).
Like all FTAs, expansion of market access by eliminating tariffs is an important feature of the SLSFTA. Singapore being one of the worlds most open economies with bulk of imports being allowed entry duty-free save a few,2 the onus of liberalisation was on Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka will be progressively eliminating tariffs on 80 per cent of goods over 15 years under the agreement, which is a relatively long adjustment period. However, the long phasing is understandable given the concerns that domestic industries might have had on opening up, and the economic uncertainties that higher supply of imports might create in some segments of the economy.
Beyond tariffs, the SLSFTA has paid heed to the issue of non-tariff measures, particularly through separate and detailed mention of quality standards for food products in both countries that mutual imports need to adhere to.3 These illustrations can act as benchmarks for future FTAs in so far as transparent outlining of quality standards are concerned that would prevent exporters from encountering unexpected regulatory barriers. The agreement has also laid down detailed provisions on commitment in services trade, including separate chapters on telecommunications and ecommerce. These provisions should help in facilitation of digital trade between both economies in the coming years and the development of Sri Lankas ambitious Port City Financial Center.
Regional Connections
After India, the SLSFTA is Singapores second comprehensive FTA with a South Asian economy. The agreement underlines Singapores search for trade and investment partners beyond East and Southeast Asia and its recognition of Sri Lankas potential as a trading hub in the fast-growing Indian Ocean region. On the other hand, from a Sri Lankan perspective, the agreement is an outcome of the countrys post-conflict trade policy to boost flagging growth and strengthen ties with Southeast Asia and the Asia-Pacific.
As Sri Lanka gets closely embedded in the Southeast Asian trade and business network through SLSFTA, it gets closer to the possibility of becoming a formal part of the ASEAN trade architecture. Indeed, the agreement marks the beginning of the possibility of Sri Lanka joining the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) upon the conclusion of RCEP at a future date and become a core element of Asias big FTA game.4 Sri Lankas aspirations are expected to be endorsed by Singapore.
Joining RCEP, which would be the worlds largest FTA between the ten-member ASEAN and its six FTA partners accounting for more than a third of global GDP and almost half of the global population, would provide Sri Lanka access to an enormous regional market and dynamic Asian FDI.
Participating in RCEP is also arguably simpler for and less draining on Sri Lankas scarce negotiating capacity than separately negotiating multiple bilateral FTAs. RCEP membership will bind Sri Lanka more exhaustively with the ASEAN architecture with which, now, its linkages are through its membership of the ASEAN Regional Forum, which mainly discusses security issues.
Towards a Fruitful SLSFTA
Much of the possibilities of Sri Lankas greater integration with the ASEAN architecture and acceding to RCEP would depend upon the success of SLSFTA. There are several examples of FTAs signed with considerable enthusiasm not being able to live up to expectations. It is important to ensure, particularly for Sri Lanka, the SLSFTA maximises its potential benefits. This would, however, require addressing a few challenges.
One of the main sources of benefit for Sri Lanka from SLSFTA is an increase in FDI from Singapore. Just about 5% of inward FDI into Sri Lanka during 201417 came from Singapore.
The SLSFTA would enable improvement of investment climate for foreign firms through its provisions on safeguards against expropriation of and discrimination against foreign investments.5 Singaporean firms can bid for large government procurement projects in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankas Board of Investment is also targeting Singaporean FDI in infrastructure, IT services, tourism and education. Nonetheless, Sri Lankas overall investment climate needs to improve on the ground doing business parameters, such as opening a business. Streamlining redundant colonial-era business regulations and demonstrating consistency in economic policy would help gain the confidence of risk-averse Singaporean investors.
Greater inter-country agency cooperation, such as between Singapores Economic Development Board (EDB) and Sri Lankas Board of Investment, can help Sri Lanka in locating sustainable FDI in key sectors like transport, logistics and urban development.
The Board of Investment needs to step away from managing export-processing zones and refocus its capacity on investment promotion. Opening its first overseas office in Singapore could contribute significantly to this objective.
The SLSFTA must note the concerns of Sri Lankan business over round-tripping of state-subsidised imports from ASEAN and China via Singapore. Such concerns can be addressed through effective usage of SLSFTAs rules of origin, which require at least 35 per cent of value added to occur in Singapore.5 Furthermore, additional concerns over surge in imports arising from lowering of tariffs can be addressed by strengthening temporary trade remedies like WTO-compatible safeguards and anti-dumping policies.
Finally, worries exist over the free movement of skilled professionals (e.g. doctors, engineers and lawyers) to Sri Lanka from third countries. However, the SLSFTA only provides for controlled entry of a few foreign managers and technical manpower per project which usually accompany FDI internationally.
Looking Ahead
Sri Lanka and Singapores warm diplomatic relations have not been accompanied by equal robustness in their trade and business relations. The SLSFTA is expected to change this substantially.
Both sides are expected to benefit significantly from the agreement. Sri Lanka is expected to gain through import of cheaper consumer goods and intermediate inputs, FDI and technology transfer and healthy competition for domestic producers.
Singapore businesses, on the other hand, will gain from greater access and investment opportunities in Sri Lankas growing economy, its base of literate and productive workers and Sri Lankas strategic location for plugging deeper in Indian Ocean trade and the South Asian regional market.
From a larger regional perspective, SLSFTA symbolises greater institutional bonding between South Asia and Southeast Asia, as well between global trade traffic encompassing the maritime spaces of Malacca Strait, Bay of Bengal and the Indian Ocean.
In this vein, Singapore is working with India and Japan to develop the Trincomalee Port (the worlds fifth largest natural harbour) and Trincomalee city in north-eastern Sri Lanka. Such integration of maritime trade and business is great news at a time when global trade prospects are threatened by uncertainties. It is important for both Singapore and Sri Lanka to capitalise the most from SLSFTA for establishing benefits of FTAs and upholding the virtues of free trade.

UNP committed to safeguard countrys unity - Hashim
The UNP is committed to protect and safeguard the country's unity, territorial integrity and sovereignty, UNP Chairman Minister Kabir Hashim said.
He said a long line of UNP leaders have sacrificed their lives in defence of the country's unity and territorial integrity during the past.This proved that the UNP had always stood by these principles he said when he called on the Malwatte and Asgiriya Prelates at their respective Temples in Kandy and received their blessings yesterday.
Hashim said the UNP will steadfastly preserve the pre-eminent position accorded to Buddhism. He dismissed as mere calumny the allegations made by opponents that the UNP was trying to divide the country and deny Buddhism its pre-eminent position.
He said he would discuss all these allegations with authority as UNP chairman.
The Malwatte prelate in his anusasana said development of rural roads should be given attention in addition to expressways and highways. He said it was the duty of both the Government and Provincial Councils and local councils to join hands and develop rural roads without trying to blame each other on this score.
He said if late President Premadasa did not build the William Gopallawa Mawatha during his tenure, traffic would have been further aggravated in Kandy.
Hashim said the government had allocated vast funds to develop rural roads through the Gamperaliya programme a short term and mid term programme would be implemented soon to solve traffic congestion in Kandy.
Provincial Council member Hidayith Sattar, MMC Raja Pushpakumara and Sri Lanka Cashew Corporation Chairman Dharmasiri Bandara Karunaratne accompanied Minister Kabir Hashim.

U.S. urges pressure against N.Korea at Asia talks
SINGAPORE: The US will urge the international community to keep up sanctions pressure against North Korea at a security forum in Singapore this week, as concerns mount that Pyongyang has made little progress towards denuclearisation.
Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and his North Korean counterpart will attend the gathering in the city-state where US President Donald Trump and the Norths leader Kim Jong Un held their historic summit two months ago. Pompeo and top diplomats from other countries involved in trying to curtail Pyongyangs nuclear ambitions will scrutinise whether the North has taken concrete steps towards abandoning its nuclear weapons.
At his landmark talks with Trump in June, Kim signed up to a vague commitment to denuclearisation of the Korean Peninsula -- a far cry from long-standing US demands for complete, verifiable and irreversible disarmament.
While there have been small signs of progress, news reports indicate Pyongyang is continuing to build rockets, and there are mounting concerns that the enforcement of United Nations sanctions on the North is being relaxed by some member states.
A US official said Washington was concerned by North Korean violations of UN-approved sanctions, including illegal shipments of oil by sea. Gatherings like Saturdays ASEAN Regional Forum are an opportunity to remind all countries of their obligations in adherence of UN Security Council resolutions, the official said.
The annual forum, hosted by the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), brings togethertop diplomats from 26 countries and the European Union for talks on political and security issues in Asia-Pacific.
The foreign ministers from all nations involved in stalled six-party negotiations with North Korea aimed at reining in Pyongyangs nuclear programme will be at the gathering: the US, China, Russia, Japan and South Korea.
Cutting off oil and fuel to the North would require enforcement primarily by China, which supplies most of North Koreas energy needs, but also by Russia, which delivers some oil to Pyongyang. Despite the concerns about the Norths progress toward abandoning its nuclear weapons, ministers at the forum are expected to strike an upbeat note about the agreement between Trump and Kim.
They will encourage the US and Pyongyang to continue working towards the realisation of lasting peace and stability on a denuclearised Korean Peninsula, according to a draft copy of the chairmans statement obtained by AFP. US officials have not said if Pompeo will meet his North Korean counterpart, Ri Yong Ho, on the sidelines of the forum.
But even if he does, Sung-Yoon Lee, a Korea expert at the Fletcher School of Law and Diplomacy at Tufts University, was sceptical that there would be any fresh signs of progress when it came to denuclearisation.
Pompeo shall gain nothing substantive other than North Koreas amenability to further talks about talks, he said.
The US Secretary of State will also focus on another major regional flashpoint at the forum -- rival claims in the South China Sea and Chinas growing presence there.
China claims nearly all the strategically vital sea, including waters approaching the coasts of ASEAN members Vietnam, the Philippines, Malaysia and Brunei.
Beijing has in recent years expanded its presence in the sea by building artificial islands capable of holding military bases.
Ahead of his trip to Southeast Asia, which will also take him to Malaysia and Indonesia, Pompeo called for a free and open Indo-Pacific region and will expand on the theme at the Singapore meeting, according to the State Department. - AFP

Wake up call for cricket in Kandy
There's good news for cricket enthusiasts in Kandy because there is a possibility of a Division III tournament and the annual six-a side tournament which was not played for many years being conducted. These tournaments were to be played this month but has been postponed due to the Esala Perehera. There will also be tournaments for State Services, Doctors, Banks, Finance Companies worked out separately on six-a-side basis.
Sri Lanka Cricket it is learnt will give a big hand for the game if it is conducted in a proper way. Kandy at one time was the second largest city for cricket next to Colombo, today it is right at the bottom in club cricket, Kandy does not have a single club playing in the Premier League, there is only one playing in the P. Sara Trophy Tournament and another club in the Division II tournament.
After Sri Lanka gained Test status, people like late Dr.C.D.L. Fernando, late M.S. Uduwella,Dr. S. Uduwella, Harindra Dunuwille and Roy de Silva, who were past presidents of Kandy CA made cricket flourish at club level, where there were several tournaments, limited over, six a-side, double wicket, and triangulars. One should not forget the yeoman services rendered by late Z.M. Jauffer and Aubrey Kuruppu when they were secretaries. And before and after test, there were people like M.B. Samarakoon, E.W. Balasuriya, Col. S. Baha, D.H. de Silva, Malcolm Perera, H. Marikar, Shaw Wilson, V. Vartharaja, Deva Amunugama, Jayantha Weerasekara, Raja Abeyanayake, M.B. Samarakoon, Dr. Deva Athureliya, M.E. Marikar, Malcolm Berenger, Bertie Gomes, R. Karunaratne and Y. Thiyakaran.
At that time there were tournaments for schools, all Island tournament for juniors, limited over for inter club, triangular, six a side, double wicket. All these tournaments have been now dumped in the Kandy Lake today. When Mahinda Aluthgamage was the Sports Minister, he gave a big hand by donating cricketing gear but it was not distributed properly.
Cricket in Kandy at club level has hit rock bottom, Kandy officials only come alive when there is an international game in Kandy. The South Africans have two ODIs this month and these officials are highly excited and on the ball to have another carnival atmosphere for their benefit.
Another reason why cricket in Kandy is at a low ebb is when it comes to matches especially schools in all age groups, only three schools have their own grounds. Most of the schools go out of town to play cricket. It is the duty of the officials who hold office to make arrangements, promote the game of cricket which has a long history in Kandy. Why did they move from Asgiriya to Pallekelle, that was to keep the school grounds free to promote cricket at Palalekelle Stadium, it was not built to play only International matches, but also to promote Kandy district cricket too. What Kandy officials talk is only about the past cricketers, Mahesh Gunatillake, Muthiah Maralitharan and Kumar Sangakkara.
They only played their school cricket in Kandy, and moved to Colombo clubs where they improved their cricketing skills. If they had remained in Kandy it would have been a different story.

Williams handed worst defeat in San Jose
Los Angeles, Wednesday: Serena Williams suffered the most lopsided loss of her career at the WTA San Jose event on Tuesday, losing the final 12 games in a shocking first-round upset to unseeded Johanna Konta.
The 23-time Grand Slam winner struggled mightily against the British No. 1 and former winner Konta, who crushed Williams 6-1, 6-0 in just 51 minutes on the main Stadium.
Williams, who was playing her first match since dropping the Wimbledon final, is trying to regain her top form after missing most of the 2017 season due to a pregnancy.
The 36-year-old Williams tried to shrug off the worst loss of her hall of fame career.
"I don't know. I have so many things on my mind that I don't have time to be shocked about a loss where I clearly wasn't at my best," she said.
Williams, who was seeded sixth, managed just nine winners against 25 unforced errors and had her serve broken six times.
She looked nothing like the player that dominated the Tour for years, winning 72 singles titles and earning more than $86 million in prize money.
"She obviously wasn't playing her best level -- nowhere near -- so I tried to play the match on my terms and just do what I can out here," Konta said.
Both women were playing their first match since Wimbledon, where Williams finished runner-up to Angelique Kerber and Konta lost in the second round to eventual quarter-finalist Dominika Cibulkova.
The loss to Konta comes just over a month after Williams complained that she is being discriminated against by the sport's drug testing program because of the number of samples she is being asked to provide. "Out of all the players it's been proven I'm the one getting tested the most. Discrimination I think so," Williams wrote in a tweet.
Williams had won this tournament the last three times she played it in 2011, 2012 and 2014 and won her only previous meeting with Konta 6-2 6-3 in the 2017 Australian Open quarter-finals. AFP

SriLankan Airlines Commission:
Witness speechless on three-year tender delays
It has come to light that there had been an inordinate delay in purchasing much needed security equipment and apparatus for the Katunayake Airport.
This disclosure was made at the Presidential Commission Investigating alleged fraud, corruption and misuse of state funds and property in SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Services and Mihin Lanka sittings on Monday. Commission member, retired High Court Judge Piyasena Ranasinghe in particular voiced concern over this delay in purchasing much needed equipment cancelling tenders for nearly three years.
When Commission Chairman, retired Supreme Court Judge, Justice Anil Gooneratne questioned witness SriLankan Airlines Security Operations Senior Manager Lal Titus Kannangara whether this inordinate delay in the purchase of much needed security equipment was proper. He became speechless.
Cross examined by Deputy Solicitor General Shanaka Wijesinghe, the witness submitted that on August 18, 2011, the European Union had pointed out that the Katunayake Airport was desperately in need of explosives detection equipment.
Without responding to that request, the Airline had delayed the purchase of equipment by cancelling tenders for a long period. It was revealed that the tender called on December 2013 was cancelled after a few months. It was revealed that their Kosala Kariyawasam, who was a member of the technical evaluation committee, had approved the cancellation of the tender.
The witness said that he chaired the Technical Evaluation Committee and the committee cancelled the tender citing security reasons.Tenders were called again by advertising in newspapers in October 2014 and closed on December 18, 2014.
The report of the Technical Evaluation Committee was released in January 2016. The tender was awarded to Excel Trading Company.
The witness said the supplier had been selected by the Technical Evaluation Committee before obtaining the recommendations of the finance committee.
