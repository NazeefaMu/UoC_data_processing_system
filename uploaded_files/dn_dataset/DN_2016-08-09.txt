Ray of hope
One of the best things about Spotlight is how its able to convey a bigger world than what we are actually shown on the screen. We hear about the wives and kids of the reporters but we dont see most of them. We dont see more than a couple of priests in a film that tells the story of how a small team of investigative reporters broke the story of Roman Catholic priests who molested children over decades and got away with it. Yet Boston comes alive through its sparsely populated neighbourhoods, its golf-playing elite folks, the Sunday morning church visits of the middle class elderly women and intimate portrayal of a handful of characters.
At one point, a character says that its not just a story for Boston but for America and the world. The film follows this line in cinematic spirit, leaving us shaken with a local story with universal resonance.
God-fearing communities
Spotlight, directed by Tom Maccarthy, who has co-written it with Josh Singer, shows the investigative reporting team from the Boston Globe uncovering of a scandal of systemic child abuse by Roman Catholic priests in the area in 2001. The decades-long cases have been hidden from public eye by way of an unholy nexus between the Church, the judiciary and government. The Boston Globes Spotlight team (said to be the oldest continuously operating newspaper investigative unit in the United States) won the Pulitzer Prize in 2003 for the series of reports on the case.
The film is a powerful assault on the business of faith and religion. It hits us in the gut through the chilling retelling of the abuse by the survivors, now grown ups with families and kids, but scarred for life as the molesters punishments are restricted to weekend duties while receiving some kind of therapy. And how this shameful cover-up involves us all: the s, the charity fund-raising elite, the complacence that so easily engulfs journalists, the cops who cant imagine taking on the Church. All of them doing their bit choosing to forget a story they all knew, let alone the government and the law.
Naturalistic acting
But what makes Spotlight as engrossing is its demonstration of the power of journalism. The change it can bring in. It shows the nuts and bolts of old school reportage behind a series of explosive stories that shook the Catholic Church. And it shows it in all its complexities: the biases and the politics in the newsroom, ego-fuelled editorial decisions, and stories hidden and lost in leads not followed up and finally, the time and space one needs to give a story to develop into a story that matters without the urgency of we-first news breaks. The acting is superbly naturalistic. The protagonists are humans with an itch to know the truth before they are journalists. They have journeys of their own. Mark Ruffalos Mike Rezendes is possessed with restless energy, either he is eating or drinking-on-the-go or jogging to work.
Spotlight is an important film, especially at times of cynicism around the profession of journalism. It is a non-showy paean to print reportage as much as it is a deeply affecting human drama.

Bourne is back!
Following the rollout of brand-new Bourne adventure after a nine-year hiatus, fans are dying to know: Could Matt Damon return for another film in the megahit franchise
Yeah. Its definitely open, the Jason Bourne star says of returning again as the deadly supersp
y. If theres a story to tell, and we think people want to hear it, then who knows
There are also two other factors that would play a big part in Damon reprising his role of tortured Treadstone agent Jason Bourne for what would be his fifth film in the franchise and the sixth overall (Jeremy Renner starred in 2012s The Bourne Legacy).
The first Thatd be the willingness of director Paul Greengrass  with whom Damon worked on the first three Bourne films to take on the project.
Im tied to Paul, whatever he wants to do, says Damon. After all, the new Jason Bourne comes as a direct collaboration between the actor and director, who frequently discussed possible storylines and plots despite years spent away from the franchise.
Were friends, so it would always come up in conversation, shares Damon. We didnt want to dive into one unless we could make a movie that fit in that family and felt worthy. Its kind of deceptively tricky, and so I think we were just leery of making it look like a job that was taken on cynically by any of us. To have made three of them that we loved, it just felt like we should live well enough alone unless we could make a good one.
And the second factor crucial to making a fifth Jason Bourne film Thatd be Damons ability to whip himself back into Bournes impressively brawny shape  something that, with time, might grow increasingly difficult for the 45-year-old actor.
I think if hes jovial and jolly and looking like Santa Claus, the franchise itself has run out of room, jokes Damon of Bourne looking anything less than impressively cut. If Jason Bourne looks like hes living well, we have no movie.

No SRK, Salman or Deepika in Farah Khans next
Farah Khan is not only a great choreographer but also a renowned director. All her films till now have been big budget ones with A listers. Be it Om Shanti Om, Main Hoon Na or Happy New Year, all the films have a Shah Rukh Khan or a Deepika Padukone or someone. But her next film will not have a star! So dont expect a Shah Rukh or Salman or Deepika Padukone in her next.
In fact, her next movie is going to be a woman oriented film. As Farah told IANS recently, I have written a script and this time its a small script, and its not star-driven. Its a two girls project so still waiting for it to happen because I have not put a big star in it.
Farah has a good reason for not having stars in her next. The filmmaker said, The thing is stars make it easier for the project to be green-lit. Otherwise, everyone will question your script 100 times if you have a star saying yes to it give that newspaper cutting and nobody will ask any question thats the good side and a bad side to it.

Rustom will leave you thinking twice about the legal system
Akshay Kumar says his forthcoming movie Rustom - based on the sensational K.M. Nanavati case of a Mumbai naval officer will make the audience think about the countrys legal system.
Q: The Rustom trailer has evoked a great response. Your response
A: Gratitude is my biggest response. I knew I liked the film, I knew I found the concept interestingly gripping. But one never knows how the world will react to what I personally feel is intriguing and interesting.
Q: Are you happy with the response
A: So far the response has been mirrored to my own emotions and that is one of the greatest feelings an actor can experience, a shared passion about ones choices of projects is just so humbling that it makes you want to hug all your fans and thank them for sharing their eagerness in your work.
Q: While the trailer was released, you were away on a holiday. Do you regret missing out on the excitement for your film back home
A: I would have regretted not being on holiday with my kids. Ive made over 130 films, and luckily still counting. But I only get so many years to throw my kids in the pool and watch them marvel at the world before they become too big and too distant for me to impress.
Q: But didnt you feel cut off from the pre-release excitement back home
A: Thanks to Steve Jobs and Mark Zuckerbergs greatest inventions, they kept me connected to the world which made me feel like I was at home feeling the love and support as if I was only inches from everyones excitement.
Q: Rustom is your first film on a crime of passion Its about a loving husband who murders his wifes lover. How difficult was it for you to portray this man who loves his country and wife but is accused of murder by the law
A: It was so thrilling for me to portray such a character, one who has nothing but love and patriotism in his heart. But a crime is a crime This film will leave you thinking twice about the legal system, the action of mankind and the ability to do the right thing at the right time.
Its one of those films that people will argue about on their way out of the theatres, questioning each other on what they would do, given the same circumstances and what would they have done if they were on that jury. Aisan Image

The warm glow of nostalgia
In my opinion, cricket loves its past. It is terrified of the future and not too sure about the present. The cancerous T20 has crept into the game big time and hence I am terrified. The issue of the death certificate is not far away.
Till death do us part, the cricket fanatics still have the good fortune that it has so much to reminisce about. Decades of polishing these anecdotes have given them a luster that more recent cricketing exploits in the ODIS and the T20s tends to lack. A man who is used to classical music can never be satisfied with Rock music or the like.
How joyous it must have been to have been inspired by the authority of Sir Len Hutton or how wondrous to recall the energy and aggression of Fred Trueman.
I can vividly recall the days in the early seventies, when I was a student in England. The Indians were touring England in that scorching hot summer of 1971. Abid Ali, the Indian military medium pacer was destroying Englands middle order.
In this same team India had their distinctive trio of devilish spin bowlers, Bishen Bedi, Chandrasekhar and Venkatraghavan. Abid Ali and Eknath Solkar the gentle medium pacers were there just to take the shine off the new ball. (When Solkar played for the Indian Schoolboys in 1964 I represented Ceylon under the captaincy of Anura Tennekoon).
England had in their ranks fast bowlers of the caliber of John Snow, Peter Lever and John Price, whose run up started somewhere in the stands.
Solkar and Abid Ali in contrast looked totally harmless. Short of stature-they had about them the distinct air of cannon fodder.
Solkar over the years managed to dismiss Geoffrey Boycott so many times that some bold observers were even heard to whisper the word bunny in connection with the great man. And on the morning of 5 August 1971, Abid Ali disposed off Jameson, Edrich, Fletcher and DOlivera to leave England on 41 for 4. For on that morning as Abid Ali bowled his little wobblies, England collapsed in abject submission.
If Yorkshire has been the cradle of cricket in England, Bombay has played an identical role in India. states Ramachandra Guha in his book, called Wickets in the East.
He further says the the dominance of the two teams in these countries cricketing histories is such that what is said of Yorkshire-that if it is strong, England is strong could just as easily be said of Bombay and India.
The similarities do not end there. Both sides have specialized in classically correct batsmen: for example Sutcliffe, Hutton and Boycott for Yorkshire; Merchant, Madave, Apte and Gavaskar for Bombay. Again both teams have been able to call upon, almost at will a succession of wily slow left arm bowlers: Peel, Rhodes, Verity and Wardle in the one case. Jamshedji, Mankad, Nadkarni and Shivalkar in the other.
When Sanjay Manjrekar and Sachin Tendulkar guided India to four draws against an infinitely superior Pakistan side in the winter of 1989, they were carrying on a remarkable tradition initiated by Vijay Merchant in the nineteen-thirties and forties, consolidated by Vijay Manjrekar and Poly Umrigar in the fifties and sixties, and raised to soaring heights by Dilip Sardesai, Sunil Gavaskar and Dilip Vengsarkar in the seventies and eighties.
The essential continuity of this tradition was maintained by Sachin Tendulkar and Ravi Shastri.

Del Potro stuns Djokovic
Rio De Janeiro, Sunday: Juan Martin del Potro stunned a tearful Novak Djokovic in an emotional Olympics triumph on Sunday as Venus Williams pondered the end of her four-gold Games odyssey.
Del Potro, the 2009 US Open champion who was pushed to the brink of retirement by a series of wrist injuries, downed the top seed 7-6 (7/4), 7-6 (7/2).
The giant Argentine had also defeated the 12-time major winner in the bronze medal match at the London Olympics in 2012.
Argentinas Juan Martin del Potro returns the ball to Serbias Novak Djokovic during their mens first round singles tennis match at the Olympic Tennis Centre of the Rio 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro on August 7. AFP
Both players embraced at the net and wept at the end of their centre court duel played out in front of a raucous Argentine and Serb crowd.
Del Potro, now ranked at 145 in the world after being number four in 2010, said Sundays win was more special than his victory in 2012.
He had his first surgery in 2010 but more followed in 2014 and 2015 when he played just six events.
This victory is bigger than last time because I know how tough it was to come back from three surgeries, said the 27-year-old who unleashed more than 40 winners.
Tonight I played one of the best matches of my career.
Del Potro started the day by getting stuck in an elevator for 40 minutes at the athletes village where he had to be rescued by the Argentina handball team.
But that inconvenience did not shake the Argentine out of his big-hitting stride as he set up a second-round clash with Portugals Joao Sousa.
Delpo was the better player and he deserved to win. Thats sport, said world number one Djokovic, whose Olympic singles record is stalled at a bronze from Beijing in 2008.
Its very sad and disappointing to go out of the tournament this early but I am glad that a good friend of mine, who has struggled with injuries, has won.
Meanwhile, four-time gold medallist Venus Williams was staring at the end of her 16-year, five-Olympics journey.
Williams, 36, and sister Serena suffered their first ever defeat in womens doubles, a record which boasted 15 successive match wins and golds in Sydney in 2000, Beijing in 2008 and London four years ago.
The 6-3, 6-4 loss to Czech pair Lucie Safarova and Barbora Strycova came just a day after Venus had been knocked out of the singles in what was her first opening round Olympics loss.
Venus, a seven-time Grand Slam title winner and the 2000 Olympic champion, said she and Serena will now focus on the US Open later this month.
It was not our best day, said Venus who will be 40 when the next Olympics rolls around in 2020 in Tokyo.
Serena, 34, was more damning.
We played terrible and that basically showed, she said.
At least, Serena is still alive in the singles as the defending champion had the perfect start in her quest for a fifth Games gold medal overall, defeating Australias Daria Gavrilova 6-4, 6-2.
Williams, sporting a patriotic Stars and Stripes hairband on centre court, will next face Alize Cornet, the Frenchwoman who defeated her three times in 2014, including at Wimbledon.
London 2012 winner Andy Murray and 2008 Olympic champion Rafael Nadal breezed through in the mens singles.
Wimbledon champion Murray, the second seed, clinched an eighth win in eight meetings against Serbias Viktor Troicki, 6-3, 6-2.
Murray, playing for the first time since securing his second career All England Club title, next faces Argentinas Juan Monaco, one of his closest friends on tour.
There was one blot on the day for Murray as he and brother Jamie were knocked out of the mens doubles by Brazils Andre Sa and Thomaz Bellucci.
Nadal, playing his first match in two months, made the second round with a comfortable 6-2, 6-1 win over Federico Delbonis of Argentina.
The 30-year-old Spaniard, sidelined by a left wrist injury since the French Open, set up a clash with Italian veteran Andreas Seppi who he has beaten eight times in nine meetings.
German second seed and Australian Open champion Angelique Kerber hit back from 2-5 down in the second set to defeat Mariana Duque-Marino of Colombia 6-3, 7-5.
French Open champion Garbine Muguruza romped to a 6-2, 6-2 win over Romanias Andreea Mutu who was a late replacement for Jelena Jankovic who withdrew with a shoulder injury. -AFP

Kelmendis historic gold sends message of hope to fledgling Kosovo
Rio De Janeiro, Sunday: Majlinda Kelmendi won Kosovos first ever Olympic gold medal at its maiden Games putting her fledgling country on the sporting map and sending a message of hope to its new generation.
The 25-year-old sank to her knees in tears after beating Italys Odette Giuffrida by yuko in the womens 52kg judo final on Sunday.
Kelmendi ran to hug supporters chanting Kosovo, Kosovo! in the stand.
I have always wanted to show the world that Kosovo is not just a country that has gone through war, she said with the Kosovo flag draped around her shoulders.
Kosovo declared independence in 2008 from Serbia, whose forces fought to stop breakaway rebels in 1998-99. One of the poorest parts of Europe, it has since had its own scrap for recognition.
Every sign of statedom counts. And the Balkans war child faced so much spotlight in the months leading up to Kosovos Olympic debut that she went into hiding with her coach to train.
Kelmendi emerged to show her pride carrying the Kosovo flag at the Olympic opening ceremony on Friday.
Her fearless determination shone through in the final. She took control from the start, pinning the 21-year-old Giuffrida quickly to score her single point yuko. Highlighting her reputation for nerves of steel, Kelmendi never gave up her slight advantage.
Japans Misato Nakamura and Russias Natalia Kuziutina won the bronze medals.
This medal means a lot, not only for Kosovos sport, but for all Kosovo as a country.
War survivors
We have survived a war. There are still kids who dont know if their parents are alive, dont have anything to eat or books to go to school. So the fact of becoming Olympic champion is just huge for all of us.
About 100 countries have given their diplomatic stamp to Kosovo. It has been recognised by the International Olympic Committee for less than two years.
But thanks to Kelmendi the sporting credibility of the 100th country to win an Olympic gold medal will not now be disputed. IOC president Thomas Bach presented her with the gold.
I had so many things going on on my mind when I was on the podium. Then came Mr. Thomas Bach, she said.

Sports Minister gets warning from IOC to fall in line

RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said that the International Olympic Committee has warned Sri Lanka to amend the countrys sports law on par with the Olympic Charter immediately or face the danger of being expelled from the world governing body.
Addressing the Sri Lanka media team here to cover the XXXIst Olympic Games, the minister disclosed that Sri Lanka will soon have to make necessary amendments to the National Sports Law to make sure that it does not clash with the clauses in the International Olympic Charter, accepted by all National Olympic Committees of member countries.
I had a discussion with the IOC officials, along with our NOC officials. They told us that Sri Lanka has been given sufficient time to make the necessary arrangements to accommodate the Olympic Charter in its sport law. We have not done that. We have been dragging this for over six years since 2009, Minister Jayasekara said.
Sri Lanka has been warned to make the necessary amendments to accept the Olympic Charter or face consequences. If we dont do that, the IOC will suspend Sri Lanka from the world sporting body. We have to act fast, he said.
The IOC has said they had to suspend NOCs of India and Kuwait in the past. They will not hesitate to do the same thing to our country as well if we dont create an environment to accept the Olympic Charter, the minister said.
He also stated that the National Sports Associations (NSAs) which does not function clean and some of the corrupt officials too should be dealt with to clean Sri Lanka sport. He insisted that the NSAs and sports officials must work tirelessly to help sportsmen and sportswomen.
Minister Jayasekera visited the Sri Lanka contingent at the Olympic Village here and personally looked into their needs. The Lankan officials freely expressed their views and problems to the minister who promised to address the issues soon.
The minister was accompanied by the Director General of Sports Saman Bandara, Private Secretary to the Minister Sampath Dissanayake and Media Secretary to Sports Ministry Prasanna Adikari.
All nine Olympians in the Sri Lanka contingent, along with their coaches and other officials, including Vice President of the NOC of Sri Lanka Deva Henry, attended the meeting.

Kimiko has a long future despite Olympic failure: Coach

RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Veteran Sri Lanka coach Manoj Abeysinghe said swimmer Kimiko Raheem should not think that her disappointing performance in Rio 2016 Olympic Games is not the end of road for her and that the promising teenage swimmer has a long way to go in her sporting career.
She is only 17 years old and competing at the highest level such as the Olympics is a big experience. It is unfortunate that she could not come out with her true form and the reason for that could be best described by her coaches in Thailand as was trained by them for over a year there, said Abeysinghe who has played a prominent role in Sri Lanka swimming, producing several top swimmers through his Killer Whales Aquatic Club.
Five-time South Asian Games gold medallist, Raheem has been training in Thailand for over a year under a full FINA scholarship and came under the watchful eyes of Abeysinghe just weeks before the 2016 Olympics on her return to Colombo on completion of the stint in Phuket.
She has been training under me for about a month and has been shaping well. She was suffering from flu after her arrival here but recovered well in time for her event. However, she was not at her brilliant best in todays heats. It was unfortunate that Kimiko could not show her true potential. But there is no need to push the panic button at this stage as she has enough time to shape well and strike right in future, he said.
Her best form could be witnessed in her early twenties and she has enough time to sharpen her skills until then. She has enormous talent and needs time and top level experience to produce results. Good that it happened here and not at 2020 Olympics.
Competing in the womens 100m back stroke heat two, the Lankan lass, the youngest of three Raheem sisters painted a poor picture with a timing of one minute and 4.21 seconds. It was disappointing. I was aiming to renew my Sri Lanka record but things did not go to my liking. But I will make use of this experience and prepare for the future. I will go back to Thailand as the British School there has offered me a scholarship to study and train. I will work harder and bounce back in near future, a determined Raheem said.
Sri Lankas other hope in swimming at Rio 2016 Games will be Matthew Abeysinghe who is down to compete in mens 100m freestyle first round heats on Tuesday (9). Incidentally, Matthew is the younger son of coach Abeysinghe whose elder son Andrew had bagged two gold medals at 2006 South Asian Games. Matthew has fared even better than his elder brother, winning a record number of ten medals, including seven golds, at 2016 South Asian Games.
Matthew Abeysinghe, who created history by becoming the first-ever Lankan swimmer to gain Olympic qualifying standards in Hong Kong last month, has been hard at training ever since his arrival here from the United States. Although his baggage was found to be missing on his arrival, he has now received it after it was found in Miami.
He has been putting a lot of effort during his training schedules. He is finding both the weather and pool conditions to his liking. He is looking forward to produce something special, coach Abeysinghe said.
Matthew too endorsed the views, hoping to continue his stunning form at the Hong Kong Age Group meet in Hong Kong last month. My training schedules have been going on smoothly and I look forward to spring a surprise or two, he said.

Geelong set to host Sri Lanka T20 international

International cricket is headed to Geelong this summer, with Kardinia Park to host one of the three Twenty20 International matches against Sri Lanka next February.
Cricket Australia today confirmed the venues for the three-match KFC T20INTL Series, with the first game to be staged at the MCG on February 17 before the action heads to Geelong (February 19) and Adelaide Oval (February 22).
All three games will be double-headers with the Commonwealth Bank Southern Stars, who will take on New Zealand.
Sri Lanka will also feature in this summer's Prime Minister's XI match, to be played as a T20 fixture at Manuka Oval on February 15.
Kardinia Park, the 11th venue in Australia currently accredited to host international cricket, played host to a KFC Big Bash League warm-up match between the Melbourne Renegades and Stars and a two-day warm-up match between Victoria and West Indies last summer.
CA have also announced Adelaide Oval will continue to host an international match on Australia Day for the next five years.
This announcement completes the schedule for the 2016-17 international summer of cricket, which will see four nations tour Australia.
South Africa and Pakistan will each play a three-Test series against the home side, while Pakistan will also play a series of five one-day internationals in January.
The Black Caps will tour in early December for a three-match ODI series to defend the Chappell-Hadlee Trophy, the matches scheduled in between the South Africa and Pakistan Test series.

Australia name   Travis Head for              Sri Lanka ODI series

Rising star Travis Head appears to be firmly in Australias plans for their next subcontinental assignment after the young South Australian batsman was today added to the one-day international squad for the tour of Sri Lanka.
Head will join the national squad in Colombo tomorrow for the lead-up to the final Test, but coach Darren Lehmann insisted that he would not be considered for selection this week.
The 22-year-old batsman and handy off-spin bowler made his sole ODI appearance during the recent tri-series in the Caribbean, but was initially omitted from the 15-man squad named for the five-match series on the island nation.
The national call-up cuts short Heads stint with English county side Yorkshire  where he blasted 175 in a one-day clash and posted a half century in his sole first-class appearance  but also suggests he is well and truly in the frame for next years four-Test tour of India.
The series looms as Australias most important assignment ahead of the home Ashes series in the summer of 2017-18, with the national hierarchy desperately searching for answers to the teams Asian affliction after the shock series loss to the seventh-ranked Sri Lankans.
Head has been considered a long-term prospect for a number of years and it is hoped the experience of training with the Test squad, followed by the ODI leg of the tour, will only enhance his Test potential.
The left-hander  who Test great Greg Chappell once described as being in the mould of Darren Lehmann - has already featured in various tours to the subcontinent, but the visit to Sri Lanka will be his first at the highest level.
Australia begin their ODI campaign against Sri Lanka on 21 August at R. Premadasa Stadium in Colombo.
Australia ODI squad: Steve Smith (captain), David Warner (vice-captain), George Bailey, Nathan Coulter-Nile, James Faulkner, Aaron Finch, Josh Hazlewood, Travis Head, Moises Henriques, Usman Khawaja, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Marsh, Shaun Marsh, Mitchell Starc, Matthew Wade, Adam Zampa.

OKeefe fined $10k after hotel incident

SYDNEY: Test spinner Stephen O'Keefe has been fined $10,000 by Cricket Australia after he was involved in an incident at a Sydney hotel on Saturday night.
O'Keefe, who was forced home from the current tour of Sri Lanka due to a hamstring injury, was issued with an Infringement Notice by NSW Police for offensive behaviour and being an excluded person remaining in the vicinity of licensed premises after a night at the The Steyne Hotel in the beachside suburb of Manly.
The NSW player was also charged with breaching Article 2.2.11 of CA's Code of Behaviour - conduct unbecoming of a player - and accepted his sanction of a $10,000 fine.
CA says the 31-year-old will also undergo counselling and education as part of his sanction.
It was O'Keefe's first offence under CA's Code of Behaviour within the past 18 months.
"I know I failed to uphold the high standards expected of a NSW and Australian cricketer and apologise to all concerned," O'Keefe said in a statement.
"I take full responsibility for my actions and accept the sanction handed to me by Cricket Australia."
O'Keefe was selected for just his third Test for the opening clash against Sri Lanka in Kandy, but was forced from the field in the second innings of the match due to a hamstring problem that also forced him out of the rest of the series.
"Steve has had a difficult couple of weeks but that is no excuse," said Cricket NSW CEO Andrew Jones.
"We expect a high standard from our players on and off the field and in this case Steve failed to meet those high standard. I have spoken to Steve and he is very disappointed with his behaviour. He has apologised to the management of The Steyne Hotel and accepts that he will be sanctioned."
Cricket Australia Executive General Manager of Team Performance Pat Howard added: "We take a zero-tolerance approach to this type of behaviour from players at any level in Australian Cricket.
