I was forced into a deal with India, J. R. Jayewardene told U.S. envoy

Sri Lanka was forced into making a deal with India as its own armed forces had twice refused to take Jaffna, then President J.R. Jayewardene has been quoted as saying in a declassified document, nearly 30 years after the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) was deployed in the island nation.
Jayewardene told visiting American diplomat Peter Galbraith that he had twice ordered his troops to take Jaffna  burn the place to the ground  and they had talked him out of it on grounds of unacceptably high casualties.
A little over 1,200 Indian soldiers died in IPKF operations against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam in northern and eastern Sri Lanka between 1987 and 1990. In May 1991, former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi, who had signed the July 1987 peace deal with Jayewardene, was assassinated by the LTTE.
In response to significant promises of devolution of powers to the Tamil minority and recognition of Tamil as an official language, India agreed to provide military assistance  the IPKF  to ensure peace according to the 1987 Gandhi-Jayewardene accord.
A mad fellow
He [Jayewardene] made clear that he shared the GOIS [Government of Indias] implacable hostility toward Prabakaran, calling the LTTE leader a mad fellow,  a declassified CIA document said about the February 1988 conversation.
He stressed, though without obvious bitterness, that none of his outside friends would help him, so he had no choice but to make a deal with India, the CIA document read.
Interestingly, the then President opened up to Galbraith and said he would hold elections in the Tamil-populated northern and eastern provinces in Sri Lanka. Polls were finally held in November 1988.
Galbraith also provides an insight into the relations between the IPKF and the Sri Lankan Army (SLA), and the ground situation in the Jaffna peninsula after being flown to the area during his visit.
the IPKF and the Sri Lankan forces are getting on well together, andthe situation in Jaffna, while still far from normal, is gradually improving, the American diplomat said in an assessment.

Marine Le Pen launches presidential campaign with pledge to give France its freedom back

Marine Le Pen has launched her presidential campaign with a pledge to hold an EU referendum, ditch the euro, withhold free healthcare from illegal migrants and slash immigration.
The far-right leader of the Front National (FN) is hoping to capitalise on a scandal destroying the prospects of former election favourite Francois Fillon, who is embroiled in controversy over payments made to his wife.
But she faces renewed competition from Emmanuel Macron, the former finance minister who has created his own En Marche! party in a bid to reach the Elysee Palace.
The majority of opinion polls currently show Le Pen, 48, winning the first round of Frances presidential election on 23 April but losing the run-off vote in May.
Her supporters, buoyed by the FNs move into the mainstream amid rising Euroscepticism, anti-immigration sentiment and terror fears, have been heartened by the shock votes for Brexit and Donald Trump.
We were told Donald Trump would never win in the United States against the media, against the establishment, but he won... we were told Marine Le Pen would not win the presidential election, but on May 7 she will win! Jean-Lin Lacapelle, a top FN official, told hundreds of party members at a rally on Saturday.
In 144 commitments published at the start of a two-day event in Lyon, Le Pen proposes leaving the Eurozone, holding a referendum on EU membership, slapping taxes on imports and on the job contracts of foreigners, lowering the retirement age and increasing several welfare benefits while lowering income tax.
The heavily protectionist manifesto also proposes curbing several rights to French citizens only, while building new prisons, hiring thousands of police and leaving Natos integrated command.
Le Pen wants to restrict universal rights including free education to French citizens, while making it harder to gain citizenship, limit migration to a net annual total of 10,000 and deport all foreign convicts and anyone under investigation for links with radical Islam.
The aim of this programme is first of all to give France its freedom back and give the people a voice, Le Pen said in the introduction to the manifesto.
This presidential election puts two opposite proposals  the 'globalist' choice backed by all my opponents... and the 'patriotic' choice which I personify.
Despite the FNs attempts to distance itself from its racist and anti-Semitic past  with founder and Le Pens father Jean-Marie convicted of both  immigration remains the main draw for members.
When Franck de Lapersonne, an actor and FN supporter, told the rally that author Victor Hugo did not learn Arabic at school and that makes me happy he received the loudest ovation of the day, with the crowd chanting the party's slogan on est chez nous, meaning this is our country.
The FN is facing scandals over assistants in the European Parliament and investigations over Le Pens 2012 campaign financing, but they have been largely eclipsed by the storm surrounding Fillon.

Panneerselvam resigns, nominates Sasikala as new Tamil Nadu Chief Minister
CHENNAI: AIADMK general secretary V.K. Sasikala was on Sunday elected as legislature party leader by MLAs during a party meeting, paving way for her to become next Tamil Nadu chief minister.
Chinnamma all set to become the Next Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, AIADMK said in a tweet.
Panneerselvam proposed her name at the meeting of AIADMK legislators, party leaders said.
I resigned and we elected Sasikala unanimously as leader of the party in assembly. All MLAs are in support, Panneerselvam said.
Earlier, Panneerselvam and other ministers met Sasikala at the Poes Garden residence of late Chief Minister J. Jayalalithaa where Sasikala continues to live.
The AIADMK legislators had not been informed about the agenda of the meeting.
The ostensible purpose of the meeting was to discuss the government's activities, issues pertaining to various constituencies and the manner in which Jayalalithaa's birth anniversary on February 24 is to be celebrated.
The meeting was called a day after Sasikala appointed some former ministers and others who were earlier shunted out by Jayalalithaa to various party posts.

South Africa v Sri Lanka: Sri Lanka lose 10 for 103 and the series
Another day on tour, another collapse - Sri Lanka sank from 60 for no loss to 163 all out at the Wanderers, mis-hitting short balls, hanging their bats out to give catches behind the wicket, and in general committing the same batting mistakes that will have become familiar to their fans during the past six weeks. Of their diminutive target, South Africa made short work. AB de Villiers produced a clinical 60 not out to bring his team home in 32 overs, seven wickets in hand.
The hosts were far from their best in their pink gear, dropping catches and attempting needless runs, but they did not need to be at their best. They have won the series now. The two remaining games are dead rubbers.
The hosts bowlers were disciplined - Imran Tahir miserly and menacing in equal measure, as usual - but there was little in the surface to warrant Sri Lanka's loss of 10 wickets for 103 runs. A little extra bounce - hardly a surprise at the Wanderers - was responsible for the wickets of Upul Tharanga, Niroshan Dickwella, Asela Gunaratne and Suranga Lakmal. Kusal Mendis and Dhananjaya de Silva were caught behind. Sachith Pathirana left a stock legbreak which turned to hit his off stump. Such was the quality of their batting.
If it wasn't for a 65-minute delay due to the arrival of a swarm of bees, Sri Lanka's innings would have been even shorter. Plenty noted that the bees had spent more time in the middle than most batsmen. Only Dickwella resisted for any notable length of time, his 74 studded with spunky square-of-the-wicket shots - usually timed impeccably. Of his teammates only three others made more than five, and only Tharanga breached 20.
It was Dwaine Pretorius, playing in his fourth ODI after replacing Wayne Parnell in the XI, who took the game's best figures of 3 for 19. He was tight with the new ball, and although not especially quick, was accurate with his variations. Tahir claimed 2 for 21 in 9.2 overs, and Kagiso Rabada got two scalps as well. South Africa's fielding was not as effective as usual, but in his 100th ODI, Faf du Plessis nevertheless managed to complete his third spectacular one-handed grab of the series, when he sprang horizontally from second slip to intercept an edge from debutant Lahiru Madushanka.
Though the scorecard will suggest Sri Lanka squandered a good foundation - the openers having made 60 together - in truth, their start was inauspicious. The first boundary came off a Dickwella top edge, and Tharanga was dropped on 11 soon after - the one-handed grab at second slip too tough for du Plessis, for once.
At the end of the first Powerplay, however, Sri Lanka were well-placed at 54 for no loss, both batsmen having found some fluency. Pretorius bowled tightly from the beginning, but Rabada, who would have been seen as the primary wicket-taking threat in the innings, had even been a little expensive in those early overs.
But when the openers both sent catches into the air off their top edges in the 12th over, things began to unravel quickly. The first of those chances - off Dickwella on 25 - was spilled by JP Duminy, who had backtracked from backward point. The second was secured by Pretorius, and the rapid fall of wickets had begun.
Andile Phehlukwayo removed Mendis and Dinesh Chandimal in the space of three overs with two unremarkable deliveries. Chandimal, especially, will be unhappy with this dismissal on what has been a poor tour. Seeing a full, wide delivery, he went down on one knee and nailed it in the air straight to the deep cover sweeper.
When de Silva fell, and following the delay, Gunaratne also went, Sri Lanka had slid to 125 for 5. Dickwella attacked for a little while, perhaps knowing there was not much batting to come, and fell by his sword when he gloved a Pretorius bouncer to the keeper. The tail barely resisted. It was all done inside 40 overs.
Lahiru Kumara bowled with characteristic spirit on ODI debut, and claimed the wicket of Quinton de Kock in the fourth over with a 142kph short ball. But though he continued to threaten through the remainder of his overs, was wayward between the good balls, and conceded more than six an over.
Kumara's opening partner Suranga Lakmal was unlucky, as he has been through the tour, gleaning an edge off Hashim Amla on 12 only for wicketkeeper Dinesh Chandimal to grass the diving chance. But with so much batting in South Africa's line-up, perhaps it wouldn't have made a major difference to the final score. Amla ran himself out for 34 anyway, though by that stage de Villiers had already begun to take the chase by the collar.
Early in his innings, de Villiers dominated Lakshan Sandakan, who had dismissed him in the previous ODI, and after about 20 balls at the crease, there was no bowler that de Villiers didn't seem capable of dictating to. He was especially active on the legside - each of his five boundaries coming there - but that was more a reflection of the lines Sri Lanka bowled to him. He took clutches of singles out to deep cover as well, and generally made a small chase seem even smaller.
Sri Lanka may take heart in the bowling of Madushanka, who swung the ball away, albeit at gentle pace, and seemed a player worth a few more games at least. Apart from him and Dickwella's innings, there was precious little to salvage from this match.

Sri Lanka-China FTA soon, Prime Minister to China in May

BEIJING: Sri Lanka aims to finalise a free trade agreement with China this year and the countrys Prime Minister will visit Beijing in May, Sri Lankas ambassador to China said on Saturday.
His comments, made during Independence Day commemoration at the embassy, comes amid rising concern in the South Asian nation about Chinese investment.
Hundreds of Sri Lankans clashed with police at the opening last month of a Chinese-invested industrial zone in the south, saying they would not be moved from their land.
It was the first time opposition to Chinese investments in Sri Lanka had turned violent, reports said.
China signed a deal with Sri Lanka late last year to further develop the strategic port of Hambantota and build a huge industrial zone nearby, a key part of Beijings ambitions to create a modern-day "Silk Road" across Asia.
Critics, including former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, an influential opposition politician who allowed Chinas first investment into Sri Lanka when he was leader from 2005 to 2015, say Sri Lankas port deal grants overly generous terms to China.

White House files appeal against Judge Robart ruling: Trump says we'll win
The US justice department has filed an appeal against a judges order lifting Donald Trumps controversial travel ban, as the new administrations flagship immigration policy threatened to unravel after one week.
After the appeal was lodged on Saturday, Trump told reporters at his private Mar-a-Lago resort in Palm Beach, Florida: Well win. For the safety of the country, well win.
Trumps comments followed a personal attack on US district judge James Robart, the Seattle-based justice who made the court ruling on Friday which questioned the constitutionality of Trumps order and which was applied nationwide.
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! Trump said on Twitter early on Saturday.
Trump, who has said extreme vetting of refugees and immigrants is needed to prevent terrorist attacks, continued to criticise the decision in tweets throughout Saturday.
The judge opens up our country to potential terrorists and others that do not have our best interests at heart. Bad people are very happy! he tweeted.
The justice departments appeal promises to create a showdown between the new administration and the judiciary over a policy that Trump consistently promised to deliver while on the campaign trail.
But the bans implementation has also placed under close scrutiny the role of the authors of the travel ban order  Trumps strategist Steve Bannon and aide Steven Miller  as the administration tries to assert its authority on the Washington bureaucracy.
After a week of chaos at airports across the US since the ban was imposed, the department of homeland security said on Saturday it would return to its normal procedures for screening travellers as it lifted the restrictions in accordance with the court ruling.
Refugees and thousands of travellers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen who had been prevented from travelling since last weekend by Trumps executive order scrambled to get flights to quickly enter the United States.
Immigration advocacy groups including the American Civil Liberties Union and International Refugee Assistance Project issued a joint statement on Saturday urging those with now valid visas from the seven nations to consider rebooking travel to the United States immediately because the ruling could be overturned or put on hold.
The justice department did not say when it would file its appeal with the ninth circuit US court of appeals.
The three-judge panel that will decide whether to immediately block the ruling includes appointees of George W Bush and two former Democratic presidents, Jimmy Carter and Barack Obama.
The travel ban brought protests across the US and the world at the weekend. In America there were demonstrations in New York, Philadelphia and Los Angeles among others, and also outside Trumps Florida resort on Saturday night where he was attending a ball with his wife Melania. There were also protests in London, Paris, Berlin, Jakarta, Manila, Hong Kong, Sydney and Melbourne.
Trumps attack on Robart also brought an angry response from Democrats. Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said: No matter how many times the president attacks this judge  it wont change the fact that this ban is unconstitutional, immoral and dangerous.
Democratic senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont said in a statement on Saturday that Trumps hostility toward the rule of law is not just embarrassing, it is dangerous. He seems intent on precipitating a constitutional crisis.
Criticising the judges decision could make it tougher for justice department attorneys as they seek to defend the executive order in Washington state and other courts, said Jonathan Turley, a law professor at George Washington University.
Presidents were usually circumspect about commenting on government litigation. Its hard for the president to demand that courts respect his inherent authority when he is disrespecting the inherent authority of the judiciary. That certainly tends to poison the well for litigation, Turley said.
It is unusual for a president to attack a member of the judiciary, which the US constitution designates as a check to the power of the executive branch and Congress. Reached by email on Saturday, Robart declined comment on Trumps tweets.
Read the so-called Constitution, tweeted Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee.
In an interview with ABC scheduled to air on Sunday, vice president Mike Pence said he did not think Trumps criticisms of the judge undermined the separation of powers. I think the American people are very accustomed to this president speaking his mind and speaking very straight with them, Pence said, according to an excerpt of the interview.
The court ruling was the first move in what could be months of legal challenges to Trumps push to clamp down on immigration.
The sudden reversal of the ban catapulted would-be immigrants back to airports, with uncertainty over how long the window to enter the US will remain open.
In Erbil, the capital of the Kurdish region of northern Iraq, Fuad Sharef and his family prepared to fly on Saturday to Istanbul and then New York before starting a new life in Nashville, Tennessee.
I am very happy that we are going to travel today. Finally, we made it, said Sharef, who was stopped from boarding a New York-bound flight last week.
