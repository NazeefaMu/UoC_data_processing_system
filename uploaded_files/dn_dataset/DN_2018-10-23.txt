All that  glitters
Inspired by the colours and textures of Sri Lankas ocean waters, Colombo Jewellery Stores (CJS) uses its newest collection, Ocean Blues to raise awareness on marine conservation, working with Dr Asha de Vos and Oceanswell.
Already well known for its pioneering tradition in the creation of high quality gem and jewellery collections, the luxury brand of CJS has developed a strong reputation for using its brand awareness to inspire social conscience for environmental issues. This year it hopes to raise awareness about the importance of protecting our oceans by partnering with Sri Lankas first marine conservation research and education organisation, Oceanswell.
Oceanswell was founded in 2017 by international award-winning marine biologist, ocean educator, National Geographic Explorer and pioneer of blue whale research in the Northern Indian Ocean, Dr. Asha de Vos. CJS will collaborate with Oceanswell on three projects, focusing on marine conservation research and education, in line with Oceanswells mission.
CJS seeks to capture the dynamic beauty of the ocean, whilst at the same time highlighting the urgent need to protect its fragile ecosystems. The Ocean Blues collection pairs the aquatic hues of blue sapphires, aquamarines and emerald cabochons, with the surf-white brilliance of diamonds and pearls to create the classically nautical blue-white combination that is so synonymous with the sea.
The jewellery designs are elegantly powerful, some following the graceful lines and geometric patterning of sea shells. Other pieces made from multi-coloured gems, reflect the warmer colours of the ocean, as seen in its coral reefs and timeless sunsets.

Australia, England reject cricket fixing as probe launched
Sydney, Monday: Australia and England Monday rejected fresh allegations about corruption in cricket by television news channel Al Jazeera, which claimed there had been 26 spot-fixing incidents in 15 international matches.
In a follow-up documentary to one aired earlier this year, the Qatari-based broadcaster reported on Sunday that a small group of England players allegedly cheated in seven games between 2011 and 2012.
It claimed Australian players were similarly involved in five matches over the same period, Pakistan players in three and players from other, unidentified, teams in one match.
In some cases, both teams appear to have delivered a fix, it said, pointing to purported recordings of a match-fixer calling in the fixes to a notorious Indian bookmaker linked to organised crime. It alleged that the suspected fixes were usually carried out by batsmen who agreed to underperform. Among the matches cited were England against India at Lords, South Africa versus Australia in Cape Town, and several games during Englands series against Pakistan in the United Arab Emirates.The International Cricket Council said it had launched an investigation and would work with professional independent betting analysts.
The ICC is committed to working to uphold integrity in cricket, said the head of the governing bodys anti-corruption unit Alex Marshall.
As you would expect we will again take the contents of the programme and any allegations it may make seriously and will investigate fully. The ICC also launched a probe after the original Al Jazeera documentary and in August Marshall said we have been able to discount a number of claims made in the programme and continue to pursue other aspects.
That documentary alleged corruption among Australia and England players in games in 2016 and 2017.Those claims were dismissed by both countries, with the latest documentary sparking a similar response from Cricket Australia and the England Cricket Board.
Cricket Australia takes a zero-tolerance approach against anyone trying to compromise the integrity of the game, and to suggest anything otherwise is unsubstantiated and incorrect, CA chief executive James Sutherland said Monday.We have full confidence in our players in also protecting the game. Prior to the latest broadcast, CAs Integrity Unit conducted a review of the claims, which it said came from a known criminal source.From the limited information provided by Al Jazeera, our team have not identified any issues of corruption by any current or former player, said Sutherland.The ECB was also adamant that the claims lacked credibility. Whilst the limited information we have been given by Al Jazeera is poorly prepared and lacks clarity and corroboration, it has been properly assessed, it said in a statement.
Analysis of this by the ECB integrity team has cast no doubt on the integrity or behaviour of any England player, current or former. AFP

Australia romp to win over UAE in one-off T20 contest
Abu Dhabi, Monday: DArcy Short smacked an unbeaten half-century as Australia cruised to a seven-wicket victory over United Arab Emirates in a lone Twenty20 international in Abu Dhabi on Monday.
Short struck eight boundaries as he finished 68 not out off 53 balls to help Australia chase down a modest 118-run target in 16.1 overs after UAE were restricted to 117-6.
Short overcame the loss of skipper Aaron Finch (one) and Chris Lynn (20) as Australia tuned up for their three-match T20 series against Pakistan starting in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
The other two matches will be played in Dubai on Friday and Sunday.
Nathan Coulter-Nile and Billy Stanlake finished with identical bowling figures of two for 20 as UAE lost wickets at regular intervals before Shaiman Anwar top-scored with 41 and Mohammad Naveed made 27 not out.

Bolt offered cut-price deal in Australia
SYDNEY: Australias Central Coast Mariners have offered sprint superstar Usain Bolt a contract, reports said Monday, but the clubs coach said he knows nothing about it.
The eight-time Olympic champion has been on trial with the A-League side since arriving in August to fulfil his dream of becoming a professional footballer.
He scored two goals in a pre-season friendly last week and on Thursday turned down a two-year, trial-free deal from cashed-up Maltese champions Valletta.
I can confirm Usain has been offered a contract by Central Coast Mariners, the Jamaicans agent Ricky Simms told the BBC.
The club had no immediate comment on Monday, but Sydneys Daily Telegraph said he had been offered only a fraction of the Aus$3 million (US$2.1 million) that his management had discussed months ago when the prospect of a trial was first mooted.
The newspaper said the potential deal put together in May -- on the premise of Bolt passing a trial first -- was based on Football Federation Australia contributing Aus$750,000 and other sponsors also topping it up.
Mariners owner Mike Charlesworth had initially pledged Aus$1.5 million, but the deal now offered to the sprinter was much less than this, it added.
The 100m world-record holder, who retired from athletics last year, has previously tried out with clubs in Germany, South Africa and Norway.
The 32-year-olds form so far has been criticised by several pundits, but his two goals captured the imagination of the sporting public. Club coach Mike Mulvey said he had heard nothing of an offer, and cast doubt on whether Bolt, who likes to play up front, would make the grade given the quality of players he already has at his disposal.
You have a look at our front line today and you wonder whether he could get into any of those positions. Wouldnt you Mulvey said after the team drew their opening A-League game of the season 1-1 away to Brisbane Roar on Sunday.
I do appreciate how important this story is for the rest of the world. Youre just talking about speculation. I dont know anything about what youre talking about and thats Gods honest truth. The Mariners boast Aston Villa striker Ross McCormack on their payroll, after the Scottish international agreed a season-long loan deal.
They also have Tommy Oar, who has played 28 times for the Socceroos, along with Connor Pain, who cleverly scored their goal on Sunday. AFP

Chinese ceramics found among Lankan ruins
Archaeologists from Shanghai Museum, China have unearthed a large number of ceramic pieces, most of which appear to be have been made in China, among the Allaippidy ruins in Sri Lanka.
This shows the links that existed between China and other countries through the ancient maritime Silk Road. The discovery was announced on September 29.
The archaeological team set out on its first overseas mission to Sri Lanka in August, when they took 40 days making a comprehensive survey of the harbour city of Jaffna and its surroundings, as well as the excavation sites in the Allaippidy and Kayts Fort ruins, according to Chen Jie, head of the team.
Chen and his colleagues excavated in an area of 92.4 square meters at the Allaippidy ruins, where 650 pieces of ceramic were found, more than 600 of which were made in China, he said.
A majority of the Chinese ceramic pieces date to the late half of the 11th century or the early 12th century, according to Lu Minghua, a researcher on Chinese ceramic with Shanghai Museum. There were bowls, plates, saucers and pots, mostly produced in places that are now located in present-day provinces of Guangdong and Fujian for the overseas sale.
The museum has increased its study of the ancient maritime Silk Road, according to museum director Yang Zhigang.
Historical documents in Sri Lanka and China show that visits between China and Sri Lanka started 2,000 years ago. In 1911, a stone tablet with inscriptions discovered in Sri Lanka spoke of Chinese explorer Zheng He making multiple visits to the island to expand trade and friendship between the two countries.
The archaeological achievement will play an important role in the studies of the trading route of the ancient maritime Silk Road, transportation networks as well as cultural communication between China and Sri Lanka, Yang says.
The museum has signed a five-year partnership contract with the Central Cultural Foundation of Sri Lanka to research the history of the ancient maritime Silk Road, perform excavations in some of the important ruins and sites in Sri Lanka, present joint exhibitions and initiate staff exchanges.
It takes many hours by road from Colombo, the commercial capital of Sri Lanka, to Jaffna, which is situated in the north of the country.
The Shanghai museum team also shared their expertise with colleagues in Sri Lanka on aviation photography, 3D modeling and ancient Chinese ceramic conservation, such as knowledge about characteristics of Chinese ceramic from different periods.
Shanghai Museum had a "successful excavation" in Qinglong town in suburban Shanghai two years ago.

Ethnic harmony vital
It was in 2015 that this government came into power with a strong promise to establish democracy and good governance. Establishing communal harmony too was at the top of the new governments agenda.
As a citizen who supported the idea of good governance, I would like to mention that this government has played a tremendous role in promoting ethnic harmony and peace in the society.
Being a country still experiencing the consequences of a thirty-year old war, Sri Lanka has a long way to go in order to become a developed nation. However during this short period the new government has been able to portray the country in a positive manner in the international arena. We have an unbiased foreign policy unlike in the past. Many foreign investors have agreed to invest in the country and tourism is booming with many tourists visiting this amazing island.
However still there are negative minded people who are not ready to admit the achievements we have gained so far during these three years. They try to spread communal disharmony through various means including social media. Despite being warned against unlawful acts, such posts are added to social media day-by-day. Strict action should be taken against those who try to create ethnic disharmony.

Convert existing threats into growth opportunities - Report
Government should utilize prevailing strengths and opportunities to convert existing threats into growth opportunities while eliminating weaknesses in a bid to develop the SME sector in Sri Lanka, a draft report commissioned by the Ministry of industry and Commerce and conducted by Ernst & Young on Legal and Institutional Study for Creating Enabling Environment for SMEs said.
The draft report has been compiled following an extensive consultation with stakeholders which included 200 SMEs and more than 30 government agencies who are involved in SME activities. And the complete report, complied with the support of Ministry of Industry and Commerce is to be launched by end of November or December this year, after incorporating all the recommendations made by relevant stakeholders into the draft report. In addition, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is expected to present a Cabinet paper shortly in relation to some of the recommendations made by stakeholders in this regard.
While the government has come up with a number of loan schemes and projects to boost the local SME sector, it is disheartening to note that the majority of real SMEs in this country have not been able to receive these loans facilities due to various reasons, Arjuna Herath, Partner at Ernst & Young told participants at the final feedback session of the draft report, held at BMICH yesterday.
Herath said Sri Lanka has over 50 government institutions and agencies serving the SME sector. Noting that access to finance and the ability to fulfill collateral requirement remain as the main challenge that hampers the growth of the industry to a great extent, Hearth mentioned some of the recommendations, highlighted in the report relating to the SME framework in Sri Lanka at the session.
Accordingly, the report suggests to create Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) affiliated credit guarantee institutions and a SME credit Guarantee Fund collaborated with CBSL and Ministry of Finance , formulate a government policy for public sector to create linkages to procure goods and services form SMEs and establish SME specific Industrial Zones, separately or within the industry zones to meet SME requirement and create online platforms to assimilate market information of the manufacturing and agriculture sectors while creating mobile applications for effective management of market supply and demand conditions at regional level.
The report also highlights the need to institutionalize the SME Authority with amalgamation of selected key existing structures, set up national SME Advisory Commission which will be the apex policy setting and monitoring body, establish the concept of one stop at the regional level, empower business support service centre which is to be set up at district level, Herath said.
Furthermore, the report stresses the need to support effective monitoring and coordination of SME related activities across the government entities, facilitate the amalgamation of National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA), Industrial Development Board (IDB) and Small Enterprises Development Bureau (SED) and absorb other SME related projects, entities and operations towards creating a SME authority.
Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the event said the study has been commissioned at a cost of Rs 3.2 million and thanked the German development agency GIZ office in Sri Lanka for extending financial support for this initiative.
Minister Bathiudeen also stressed: There are more than one million registered SMEs in Sri Lanka providing employment to three million. When we take the unregistered SMEs the numbers will be much more. 52% of our GDP is driven by this sector with more than 40 percent of employment. Also More than 70 percent of enterprises are SMEs and in 2013 20% of exports came from SMEs.

CSE launches Advanced Diploma in Financial Markets
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) recently launched an Advanced Diploma in Financial Markets (ADFM) academic qualification, where the program for the first intake of students is presently underway.
This is the first occasion CSE will award an academic qualification in its history, and is an initiative implemented in response to a growing demand for an entry-level academic qualification to be awarded by the exchange to foster greater knowledge on financial markets, particularly with a specific focus on capital market operations and investment.
The ADFM course is designed to offer students a comprehensive understanding of financial markets and focuses on areas such as capital market regulation, investment analysis, portfolio management, macro-economics and other related subject matters.
Commenting on the initiative, the CEO at CSE, Rajeeva Bandaranaike said, The CSE is recognized as a key stakeholder in the capital market and has built a substantial level of expertise during its operation for over 30 years. Through this initiative, we look to combine that know-how with the expertise of renowned visiting academic professionals to deliver a balanced and practical course to students.
Stock Exchanges around the world and even in South Asia have formalized their education efforts through the establishment of institutes and with the awarding of market related qualifications. We believe that the introduction of ADFM in that sense is certainly a step in the right direction and will enhance our efforts to foster financial literacy, Bandaranaike said.
The modules will pave the way for students to apply theoretical knowledge while gaining a unique level of exposure into financial market operations. The course is expected to be completed within a six month period, where CSE will also take the initiative to offer internship opportunities to top performers.
The modules will be conducted by an eminent panel of lectures consisting of respected local university lecturers and capital market experts. The next intake of students for the program is set to be conducted in January 2018 and will be announced on the CSE website www.cse.lk
The Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) operates the only stock market in Sri Lanka and is responsible for providing a transparent and regulated environment where companies and investors can come together.

Development has reached the grassroots as never before - PM
This is a period where development has reached the grassroots level as never before, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister further said that development projects undertaken by the present government at grassroots level is unprecedented in the countrys recent history with more than 100,000 rural development projects currently in progress.
Around 50,000 of these projects have been implemented under the Gamperaliya rapid rural development drive of the government and Rs.20 billion has already allocated in this regard, the Prime Minister said. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe made these observations participating as the Chief Guest at the ceremony to grant appointments to Grama Niladaris and Administrative Grama Niladaris at Temple Trees yesterday.
Rural development is not only the responsibility of the Central Government. But, we have implemented a large number development projects at grassroots level.
We need to pump in more funds to the villages to strengthen the village economy, the Premier added.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe assured that the government is ready to confront natural disaster situations that occur as a result of climate change and also deal with the consequences of the global financial crisis.
The Prime Minister predicted a growth in the countrys economy before the next Sinhala and Hindu New Year as they expected a bountiful agricultural harvest this Maha Season.
When we came to power, we had to face various challenges including the debt trap, natural disasters and the Meetotamulla garbage dump collapse. However, we were able to overcome all these challenges. Hereafter, we do not need to worry about such issues and need to be stronger in the face crisis situations. In this regard, Grama Niladaris have to play a key role by providing necessary services to the public along with the government, the Prime Minister said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further said the rural administration is very much essential to a country since it is part and parcel of the state administration.
The government has already taken measures to improve the rural economy in order to protect our villages from the effects of the global economic crisis. The entire world has been badly affected due to the increase in oil prices and the dollar exchange rate, the Premier said.
The strong dollar weakens the Sri Lankan Rupee since Sri Lanka has no export-oriented economy. If a country can earn sufficient foreign exchange by exporting goods, the strengthening of the dollar has no impact on the countrys economy. However, the oil price hike would have a drastic impact on the economy, the Prime Minister added.
But, today Sri Lanka has failed to earn sufficient foreign exchange. The economic crisis faced by the country would greatly affect the village economy. In order to avoid this, the government has already implemented massive rural development programmes, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Gamperaliya programme is one of the main initiatives taken by the government to strengthen the village economy. A large number of projects have been implemented under the Gamperaliya programme, covering every nook and corner of the country. The government has also allocated funds for rural economic development under the Decentralised Capital Budget Programme.
Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena, Public Administration and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara and State Minister of Home Affairs J.C. Alawathuwala also participated at the occasion.

## Title: Finance Ministry on divestiture of Hyatt and Hilton Hotels

Finance Ministry on divestiture of Hyatt and Hilton Hotels
The decision to divest Hilton and Hyatt hotels, which are non-strategic holdings of the Government, was decided by the Cabinet of Ministers and proposed in several budget speeches, a Finance Ministry press statement said.
The press release in full. Hyatt Hotel, which is partially completed has so far cost the Employees Provident Fund, Sri Lanka Insurance and Litro gas, all state-owned organizations and accountable to the people, over Rs 15 billion. Furthermore, these same state organizations would have to put more money and give guarantees to banks for a much higher amount to complete the hotel. Public money, especially that of the EPF, should not be spent on building hotels, where the returns on investment can take many years. Therefore, the Hyatt hotel has to be divested to a reputable investor with the financial strength to complete the hotel without this being a burden to the State.
The Hilton Hotel, which has been profitable, to reach its full potential and compete with newer hotels needs to upgrade the hotel rooms, which have not been done for 30 years. The cost of refurbishment is expected to over Rs 4 billion. Also, this hotel has a foundation built for an additional hotel tower and 2 acres of land on which new investment in commercial property or serviced apartments can take place. As a Government owned enterprise, the hotel does not have the financial strength to undertake these new investments and if it does, the Government will have to fund this or expensive loans have to be taken. Therefore, it is justified to divest this hotel to a financially strong investor who can proceed with these new investments and generate more employment opportunities.
Importantly, the Treasury, EPF, Insurance Corporation and Litro Gas can put the money received from the divestiture to better use for the benefit of the public. In addition, the Government is committed to give a number of shares in the Hilton hotel to its employees on a scheme to be finalised andadvised in due course. Therefore it is in the best interest of all stakeholders and the countrys economy to attract new foreign and local private investments into these assets.
On the divestiture process, the government is following a transparent mechanism. First, since this is an investment, it is required that investors are provided with a detailed information memorandum that would enable them to carry out a due diligence and investment appraisal. Therefore, the Government decided to appoint an independent financial adviser with offices globally who has experience in divesting hotel assets. Via a cabinet appointed consultancy procurement committee, after issuing a RFP, Lazard Asia of Singapore and MTI Consulting of Sri Lanka were selected as financial advisers with the approval of the Cabinet. They were selected out of 16 international local and foreign financial advisory firms who responded.
Then a Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee will be appointed to overlook the divestiture process with the assistance of the Financial Advisers and National Agency for Public Private Partnership. The first step in the process is to call for expressions of interest. This is only for the purpose of identifying who the bidding party is. Via the EOI advertisement placed, interested parties have to indicate their business, financial strength and which hotel asset they have an interest in purchasing. When they contact the financial advisers, the investors will be sent a simple one page format to fill out basic information about themselves and information on the hotels that is non-confidential will be given to them. If investors need more time to respond to the one page format, they can request for this.
Therefore, the expression of interest does NOT require a priced bid.
Meanwhile, Lazard and MTI through their global offices have already begun to reach out to international real estate investors covering many countries.
Why this is being done this way is that both hotels are governed by management agreements with Hilton and Hyatt International hotel management companies and these agreements have confidentiality clauses, which restricts the hotel owning companies from releasing sensitive commercial information.
It is for this reason that parties who express interest will be first shortlisted and then bound to sign a Non-Disclosure and Confidentiality Agreement. Only after this is signed will the interested investors (not brokers) be given more than 100 pages of detailed financial and other information and given access to a security controlled data room. It is after this that the transparent bidding process will start under supervision of the relevant Cabinet appointed committee, where prospective investors will have ample time over several months to prepare financial bids and bid conditions.

First Man Giant step in Retrospect
Karen Armstrong dies, leaving her father in an ineffable agony. Her death following fast-declining health brought some kind of halt to the smooth-sailing lifestyle of her father. Stunned by his daughters sudden death, Neil Armstrong draws himself almost obsessively to his career as an astronaut.
Damien Chazelles First Man then careens around the core lifestyle of the eminent astronaut. Very much an introvert, Armstrong is nevertheless surrounded by a team of extrovert associates. Most of his colleagues undergo the inevitable perils during the space mission stretched between 1961 and 1969. Which is to say how the space conquest was not accomplished overnight.
That single step placed on the fifth-largest natural satellite in the Solar System was considered one giant step back then. The news fed the global press machine including this very newspaper, Ceylon Daily News, which covered the first moon landing for seven consecutive days on front page. A few decades later, however, that euphoria paled into insignificance with technological progress taking place in a sophisticated pace. Although the world has mach more to indulge in than the first moon landing, the event has stirred interest in James R. Hansen who authored First Man: The Life of Neil A. Armstrong. Chazelles cinematic work is based on Hansens work.
The movie is notable on several grounds. Chazelle throws us back to the sixties when no smart device was available. That was a period when television entered the household as new media and the supersonic plane was the focal point of the science discussions. On the other hand, we are made privy to most sensitive episodes in the lifestyle of a world-renowned scientist  especially his relationship with his deceased daughter.
Moon is the connecting factor between any parent and a child at night. Karens father shows her the moon and shares many narratives. It does not take so long for Karen to develop an attachment with the planet perched so afar. The moment Armstrong sets his foot on the moon, he remembers his daughter and the talks they had over the moon. Then the camera pans to his hand to show what he had been holding in his hand. The keepsake he had kept in memory of his daughter with the letters of her name. Before turning back, Armstrong leaves the keepsake on the moon  a respect no other father has been privileged with.
The biopic also reveals rare events of the era. The fact that the three astronauts were kept quarantined upon their return remains a fact little known. Taking a decision to be onboard for the historic mission was not easy for Armstrong. Some of his colleagues had to compensate with their life during the experimental mission.
His wife would not simply let him go. She offers him the challenge probably much tougher than landing on the moon: enlighten his children about the risk of his mission and the fact that he might never be back.
The cinematography has dominated the work with its organic quality. In fact more cinematographic prominence is given to the technical aspect of the space mission than the astronauts private life. As the rocket propels, the process is shown in many angles. The shaky nature of the interior is very much felt.
Ryan Goslings portrayal as the titular role comes to the fore as natural. We naturally fall in love with the young and energetic version of Neil Armstrong thanks to Goslings subtle performance. Breathing life to the celebrated astronaut looks like no rocket science for Gosling of course as we are already familiar with his mature performance as Noah in The Notebook.

Ananda College has produced scholars, scientists, sportsmen and artistes throughout the decades who have brought glory to mother Lanka.
There are veterans in the photography fraternity in the country who are Anandians who bequeath their knowledge on young and budding photographers constantly via workshops and photography exhibitions.
Ananda College Photographic Art Society (ACPAS) was found way back in 1946 with the prime objective of nurturing the artistic photography skills among young Anandians.
With a legacy of 72 years ACPAS has become one of the pioneering photography societies in Sri Lanka. Over the decades it has produced reputed personalities in the field of photography.
The ACPAS society launched Pilimbimbu photography magazine in 2001.
With the payoff line, See the world through the third eye ACPAS endeavours to constantly add value to the fraternity by way of producing better professionals and service oriented photographers.
Partnering with University of the Visual and Performing Arts in Sri Lanka the 72nd anniversary of ACPAS was celebrated by the Anandians with Pilimbimbu 2018 integrated photography program.
Pilimbimbu 2018 has focused on spreading knowledge regarding new trends in photography. The four phases of the program include inter-school quiz competition and practical test, inter-school art-photography exhibition and competition, photographic magazine and the photography event, Pilimbimbu 2018.
Pilimbimbu photography exhibition was held on October 18 and 19 at the J D A Perera Art Gallery ([emailprotected]) with veteran photographer Lakshman Nadarajah gracing the occasion and senior photographer Henry Rajakaruna as the chief guest.
The exhibition showcased artistic and professional photographs by professionals and amateurs on diverse themes in colour as well as in black-and-white. Each contestant this time around was offered to present a maximum of eight photographs.
Pilimbimbu award ceremony was held on October 18 at 2 pm.
Awards were presented in the inner school, inter school, inter university and open categories.
Still-Photography is a powerful medium of communication. We promote ethical photography via ACPAS. In current times some quarters are all out to ruin the photography field by posting unethical photographs via social media and other means. With the help of veterans we teach our students the scientific way of the subject and how to have self-imposed control when communicating with the society via photographs, said ACPAS teacher-in-charge Vipulika Fernando.
This time around we have opened doors for professional photographers of Sri Lanka as well as from other countries to participate in the Pilimbimbu open contest, she added.

The first award was in the Large Scale Service Category and the second in the Small Scale, Services Category. The awards ceremony was held on a grand scale in Kandy under the patronage of Central Province Governer P. B. Disanayaka and Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake.
Hewage Holdings is the sales agent for many popular companies in the country. The Hewage Super Market is located in Katugastota. We also have Hewage Family Super branches in Colombo Street-Kandy, Wattegama, Lewella, Poojapitiya and Barigama. We opened the first Ekmo 8 to 8 branch in Gunnepana recently. The second branch would be opened by November in Medawela, Jagath Hewage said.
Hewage said they plan to open eight more branches by next year and insisted the need of having a government level program to uplift businessmen and to provide them with the necessary concessions. Due to delays at the district secretariat, local authorities, divisional secretariat, police, electricity and water boards, it has become difficult to run businesses in a competitive business environment, he said. At the same time, all businessmen need to be given loans at the same interest rate. Large scale businesses get loans at 14 percent whilst a small scale one has to take a loan at 16 percent interest rate; at times it is even higher. Many businesses also suffer due to excessive taxing. When small businessmen do not have to pay VAT, we have to pay the VAT as well as sell the goods at the same price. We need a common taxation system for all businesses in the country, Hewage added.

The photographers Instagram gallery showcases their incredible bond, but also the beauty of the surrounding landscape. From trails among lush, green forests to doggy paddles in picturesque lakes, each image is sure to give you a case of wanderlust. Troja is captured majestically surveying the landscape and playfully pouncing through snow, all while faithfully following Rotan wherever he goes.
Despite their adventurous lifestyle, Troja wasnt always so outgoing. When Rotan first adopted her in 2012, she was almost too anxious to go to a new home. Troja was very weak and insecure as a pup, but she had such a soulful, unique personality, says Rotan. I instantly fell in love with her and vowed to help her get better. After slow introductions to new places, people, dogs, and even wild animals, Troja eventually grew into the spirited dog she is today. Being with her throughout her process has had such a huge impact on my life and personal development as well, reveals Rotan. Shes shown me why humans and dogs have coexi sted so peacefully for thousands of years.

Human negligence causes death by elephants, says expert
In most instances its not the elephants that kill humans, its the humans that get themselves killed by the elephants due to their stupidity and negligence, said Dr Sumith Pilapitiya, former Director General of the Wildlife Department, delivering the monthly lecture of the Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) at the BMICH on October 18.
Speaking on humanelephant conflict management, he said 70 percent of human deaths by elephants are due to human irresponsibility.
He also said that the human deaths caused by elephants were a mere fraction when compared to the number of deaths due to motor accidents. Humans should take more responsibility for their lives. In most instances, it is people who have been under the influence of alcohol who have been killed because they challenge elephants rather than avoid them.
Dr. Pilapitiya said there were instances where people had been so negligent that they have crashed into elephants and got themselves killed. If we are more responsible and do not act stupidly, we can reduce the number of human deaths significantly, he said.
Dr. Pilapitiya said that in the 1950s, Singaporean Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew is known to have said he hoped someday that Singapore would be like Ceylon, but from the mid 1970s onwards, every successive government in Sri Lanka has hoped that Sri Lanka would be like Singapore. But we are far from Singapore today. One of the main reasons is that we continue to keep repeating the same mistakes without learning from them. When it comes to the management of the humanelephant conflict (HEC), once again I think we are in a similar situation.
Humanelephant conflict

Referring to research and statistics obtained from Dr. Prithiviraj Fernando and the Centre of Conservation and Research (CCR), Dr. Pilapitiya said in Sri Lanka there are known to be about 6,000 elephants in the wild. Sri Lanka has the highest density of Asian elephants as well as a very high population density of humans on a rapidly declining natural resource base.
Unless we plan our development better, conflict is inevitable, he warned. HEC cannot be eliminated fully. As long as there are humans and as long as there are elephants, there is going to be conflict. The only thing we can do is manage and minimise the conflict.
The HEC conflict started increasing with the large-scale irrigation and agricultural development drive initiated in the 1950s. In 2000, 150 elephants died while only 63 humans were killed by elephants, but in 2017, 256 elephants died while 87 humans were killed by elephants.
The committee for the preservation of wildlife appointed in 1959 came up with a plan to manage the HEC in the island by driving all the elephants from developing areas to protected areas of the Department of Wildlife and Conservation (DWC) through identified corridors and fencing them in.
There were three approaches to managing the HEC: (1) translocation of problem elephants to protected areas of the Wildlife Department; (2) large-scale elephant drives from areas identified for development to DWC protected areas; and (3) confining elephants to DWC protected areas with the use of physical, biological and psychological barriers.
If this strategy was successful, the HEC would have been minimal today. A survey done by the CCR shows that 44 percent of the land area of the island is shared by humans and elephants. Dr. Pilapitiya said research had shown that capture and translocation was not successful nor could biological fences confine elephants within protected areas.
Relocation not the answer
Dr. Pilapitiya said most national parks already have the full number they are able to accommodate, and driving more elephants into such DWC protected areas would result in the death of many elephants and calves due to starvation. He mentioned that one drive had cost the government Rs. 62 million to relocate 225 elephants and calves in a Wildlife protected area. The end result was that the problem was not solved as it was only the she-elephants and calves that were driven, while the single males and male groups had remained to forage on crops. Moreover, many of these elephants that were driven died of starvation. No one was held accountable for the fiasco and the waste of public funds. It was the development sector that should have been held accountable as the Wildlife Department was under severe pressure to carry out orders.
The National Elephant Conservation Policy (NECP) which is in effect today was drawn up by a multi-stakeholder committee and approved by the Cabinet in 2006. Some of the goals of the policy are to ensure the long-term survival of wild elephants in Sri Lanka to mitigate the humanelephant conflict and to promote scientific research as the basis of conservation and management in the wild. Some key points are that managing as many viable populations of elephants as the land could support and that landholders will accept both within and outside the system of protected areas. The policy also specifically states that when elephants lose their range, they die.
Plans cannot drive policies
Dr. Pilapitiya said a new plan for resolving the HEC was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers on August 7, 2018, which is more in line with the 1959 plan and contradicts certain aspects of the 2006 policy. To the best of my knowledge, policies should be driving plans and plans should not be driving policies, he stressed.
He also said there are many positives in the recent Cabinet paper such as constructing 2,651 kilometres of electric fencing within identified areas which shows that there is still room to construct the fences on ecological boundaries rather than administrative boundaries. It is imperative that inasmuch as the new fences are constructed on ecological boundaries, all existing fences should be relocated to ecological boundaries, Dr Pilapitiya emphasised. Among his concerns was arming those who are to be entrusted with maintaining the fences with sophisticated weapons that are capable of killing an elephant in its tracks. Accidents do happen! he said.
Dr. Pilapitya said development plans should be made accepting the elephants presence and by working around them rather than driving them away. A winwin situation could be achieved by relocating the development project rather than creating conflict. He also said scientific findings and past experience should govern the decision-making. All options should be looked at. Community-based village fences and seasonal agricultural fences would be a viable alternative if it is not possible to construct fences on the ecological boundaries.
These were some things that I intended to do when I was the Director General of the Wildlife and Conservation Department, but I resigned as I was unable to perform my duty due to political pressure, Dr Pilapitiya said. As conservationists, we can lobby and convince decision-makers to make correct decisions rather than repeating the mistakes we made in the past.

INTERNATIONAL OUTRAGE AFTER SAUDI ADMISSION
UK: Saudi Arabias belated admission that writer and onetime royal insider Jamal Khashoggi died in the kingdoms consulate in Istanbul more than two weeks ago is failing to stop the international outcry over his slaying.
The Saudi claim that the 59-year-old Khashoggi brawled during a quarrel with security officials came 18 days after repeated Saudi assertions the dissident left the consulate alive and
Reported ties between the killers and Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman and shifting explanations being offered by Riyadh have only increased suspicion about what really happened to Khashoggi.
Saudi writer Jamal Khashoggi entered the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on October 2.
Allies in the West and the Gulf are becoming more anxious about the consequences from the slaying in terms of dealing with the kingdom and the possible fallout in Saudi Arabia, say analysts and diplomats.
Four of the 15 Saudi security operatives and officials who flew into Istanbul hours before Khashoggi was due to visit the consulate were among the bodyguards protecting the Crown Prince on a visit last March to London. One of them, Maher Abdul Aziz Mutreb, was photographed in London during the visit.
Last week, The Washington Post reported five members of the Saudi team that flew to Turkey had traveled to the United States in recent years on trips overlapping with visits by the Crown Prince, suggesting they are members of his security entourage.
The links between what Turkish officials describe as a hit squad dispatched to murder Khashoggi, who lived in self-imposed exile in the United States, and the Crown Prince are complicating Riyadhs efforts to distance Mohammed bin Salman from the gruesome incident.
The Saudis are apparently trying to contain the blame to two high-ranking officials, Saud al-Qahtani, a close confidant of Mohammed bin Salman, and Ahmed al-Asiri, the deputy intelligence chief. Both men have been fired, according to Riyadh.
The Saudi government says 18 suspects have been arrested and officials maintain all acted independently of the Crown Prince. But Mohammed bin Salmans critics at home and abroad point to a tweet by Qahtani last year in which he said he never acted without the approval of the monarch or the Crown Prince.
Many countries have expressed astonishment over the Saudi story that discussions aimed at trying to persuade Khashoggi to return to the kingdom went awry and led to a fight and a quarrel. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said, We expect transparency from Saudi Arabia about the circumstances of his death... The information available about events in the Istanbul consulate is inadequate.
French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian has called for a full investigation, joining a similar demand by U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres and EU foreign policy chief Federica Mogherini. Australia and New Zealand announced Sunday they are joining a boycott of a major investment conference this month in Saudi Arabia, joining Britain, the Netherlands, France and the United States in protest over the Khashoggi killing.
Australias Prime Minister Scott Morrison, said Sunday the latest Saudi explanation for what happened to Khashoggi cannot stand. Canadas foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, said the explanations offered by Riyadh lack consistency and credibility.
British lawmakers and rights campaigners are demanding targeted sanctions on Saudi officials, a demand also made by U.S. lawmakers. British Foreign Minister Jeremy Hunt questioned the credibility of the Saudi claims of how Khashoggi met his end. A British official told VOA, There is no justification for this killing and how we respond will partly be determined by the truthfulness of the Saudis.
The former head of Britain intelligence service, John Sawers, said Friday he had little doubt the order to kill Khashoggi came from highest levels of the Saudi government.
U.S. President Donald Trump said Saturday, Im not satisfied until we find the answer, although he added it was possible the Saudi Crown Prince did not know about the killing. Trump said sanctions are possible, but he hoped that wouldnt involve halting a multi-billion-dollar arms deal, which he said would hurt the United States more than Saudi Arabia.
Turkish officials say they have audio and video evidence Khashoggi was tortured, killed and dismembered on an office desk in the consulate. Turkish officials, who have been leaking gruesome details of the killing to pro-government media in Turkey, have threatened more revelations.
Whether the pressure reaches a breaking point for Western allies may depend on how much information the Turkish government chooses to release. Turkeys foreign minister, Mevlut Cavusoglu, says when Turkey completes its investigation it will share the results with the world. On Friday it added pressure on Riyadh by starting to interview Turkish employees of the consulate. - VOA

## Title: JO's communal politics

JO's communal politics
The Joint Opposition are at it again. The recently passed Office of Reparations Bill in Parliament has made some of the JO stalwarts jump on their hobby horse of communal politics. Loud noises are being made that the government has surrendered to the Tamil diaspora to offer compensation to the families of LTTEers. This, when the intention of the Act is to offer compensation on behalf of all victims of the war whether in the North or the South. Pro-Rajapaksa TV channels have gone into high-dudgeon questioning the wisdom of the piece of legislation. One of the hosts of a Private TV slot dedicated to reading out the daily newspaper reports to its audiences the other day was weeping buckets on behalf of those civilians in the South massacred by the LTTE terrorists to whose families an insensitive Government was now all set to pay compensation. This is in addition to the media conferences held by the JO MPs to focus the spotlight on the 'betrayal' of the war heroes by the Yahapalanaya Government by this act.
It is in this context that the JVP deserves the salutation of all fair minded citizens of this country for taking a contrary view. This, despite its much blemished past on the communal front. Taking a huge political gamble the rathu sahodarayas have sided with the Government to offer compensation to all the victims of the Eelam war.
Addressing a media conference, JVP Propaganda Secretary MP Vijitha Herath condemned the racist elements in the JO for describing the Bill as being solely a means of paying compensation to former LTTEers. He said that the objective of the Bill was to compensate those who had been affected by political and civil conflicts. The Bill seeks to compensate all those who were affected irrespective of their communal background. "All those who suffered due to the conflict deserve justice", he went onto stress.
This, from a member of a political party whose founder leader was a rabid nationalist and who rose against a Government who was perceived (in his eyes) as offering concessions to the minorities. It was also the same party which withdrew from Chandrika's pariwasa aanduwa taking objection to CBK's move to share Tsunami funds with the LTTE, through the mechanism that was known as PTOMS. The JVP, it appears, has learned from its mistakes and adapted itself to the present times. It even held one of its party conventions in Jaffna, a far cry from the days when it ordered the public not to view Tamil and Hindi movies, although this was in connection with its Anti-Indian campaign, at the time, in aftermath of the Indo-Lanka Accord.
The JO, on the other hand, had hardly learned anything, not even after the defeat of its leader Mahinda Rajapaksa suffered on January 08, which was largely attributed to the minority backlash due to the racist policies of the Rajapaksas. Post-war victory parades were held ad nauseam in a style and manner that made Tamils feel a conquered race. Not only that, Rajapaksa also banned the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil in schools and Government offices in the North in a fit of pique after his 'Oxford Lecture was cancelled following a demonstration by Tamils in London.
In any event, Rajapaksa may be laying little store in the support he will receive from the northerners, even the next time around, for his nominee at a Presidential Election. This is after he nonchalantly dismissed his defeat on January 8 to the votes cast by the Tigers and that he would not consider it as a defeat mata meka parajayak nevei, mokada mang peredune koti chanda nisa. That the northern vote is of no consequence to the Rajapaksa camp is also demonstrated by the composition of Eliya, a platform to promote the candidacy of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, that include the likes of Major General(Rtd.) Kamal Gunaratne whose publication, Road to Nandikadal, is bound to raise many an eyebrow.
Be that as it may, the objection taken by the JO to the families of alleged ex-LTTEers being compensated is nothing less than sheer hypocrisy. We say this because not very long ago the Rajapaksas had among their fold an LTTE Regional Commander responsible for the cold blooded massacre of 600 policemen in the East, the machine gunning of a bus load of Samaneras in Aranthalawa, and, what is more, the bombing of the sacred citadel of the Sri Dalada Maligawa, in addition to countless other atrocities. He was not only made a Government Minister under Rajapaksa but also made an office bearer of the SLFP. Karuna Amman is his name.
Why the likes of Wimal Weerawansa and Udaya Gammanpila, whose watch words are 'betrayal', are yet silent on this score, all right thinking members of the public would like to know We also did not see any objections raised by the Maha Sangha at the time the appointment was made. Is it because anything is par for the course under Mahinda Rajapaksa, the epitome of patriotism

Landslide warning for Nuwara Eliya district
The National Building Research Organization (NBRO) yesterday issued a landslide warning for the Nuwara Eliya district due to the prevailing heavy showers. According to their report, the Walapone Divisional Secretariat and the nearby areas of Nuwara Eliya district are prone to landslides.
Since the rainfall within the past 24 hours has exceeded 75mm, if the rain continues, the NBRO warned people to be watchful of the possibility of landslides, slope failures, rock falls, cutting failures and ground subsidence.
The people in the those areas must pay attention to landslide signs such as development of cracks on the ground, deepened cracks and ground subsidence and slanting of trees, NBRO stated.
Attention should also be paid to electrical posts, fences and telephone posts, cracks in the floors and walls of buildings which are built at slopes, sudden appearance of springs, emerging muddy water, blockage or disappearance of existing springs. People should immediately move away from the areas where they notice pre-landslide signs.
If heavy rain continues, people living in landslide susceptible areas should be vigilant and be ready to move quickly to safe places.
According to the Meteorology Department, Showers or thundershowers will occur in many provinces over the island after 2 pm.
Heavy falls of about 100 mm can be expected at some places in the Central, Uva, Sabaragamuwa and the North-Central provinces and in the Ampara and the Hambantota districts.
Showers could occur at several places over the North-Western, Western and the Eastern coastal areas in the morning as well.
There may be temporary localised strong winds during thundershowers. The public is requested to take adequate precautions to minimise damages caused by lightning.
Meanwhile, showers or thundershowers would occur in the Northwestern and the Western coastal areas and showers or thundershowers may occur at several places in the other coastal areas around the island in the evening or night.
Winds will be Westerly along the coastal areas extending from Puttalam to Hambanthota through Colombo and Galle. Winds will be variable in direction in the other coastal areas around the island.
The wind speed will be 20-30 kmph in the coastal areas around the island. Temporarily strong winds and rough seas can be expected during thundershowers.

Lankan family in NZ granted residency after eight-year battle
A year after they pleaded to avoid deportation to Sri Lanka, a family in Queenstown, New Zealand, has been granted residency and are giving back to the community that supported them.
I am overjoyed, Dinesha Wijerathne said, now working as a chef at the community project Lets Eat.
Her husband Sam Wijerathne, a taxi driver, said they had struggled for eight years to reach a point of certainty for their family.
We came here for a better life for our kids. It has been a hard life, but now the boys are doing their school work, he said.
The couple and their three primary school-aged boys had lived, worked and studied in New Zealand for eight years when their world fell apart.
As they went through the residency application process, Dinesha Wijerathne, the primary visa holder, was diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) and was unable to work.
Their working visa applications were then declined and the future looked grim. However, their story touched the hearts of many people.
Queenstown Primary School was amongst the first to rally behind them. Tam Schurmann and the charity Baskets of Blessings became involved after hearing of their situation.
Hamish Walker, a local MP there, had also stepped in to help. He assisted them to appeal to the Immigration and Protection Tribunal, buying time for the family before requesting the Immigration Minister to intervene.
From the beginning, Walker promised the family he would do everything he could to keep them in New Zealand, but knew the odds were against them. We didnt have long at the time. They were weeks away from being deported, he said. But the incredible public support was a key factor, Walker added.
Schurmann first met the family when Dinesha Wijerathne was nominated for a gift basket through Baskets of Blessing.
When that was delivered, we realised there was a far greater need. We put the word out to the greater community, that they were unable to work and couldnt put food on the table, he said.
We were overwhelmed with unconditional love: from single mothers dropping off half of their weekly groceries to residents from all walks of life, Dinesha said, The community fed my family for about eight months.
When Dinesha Wijerathne was given permission to work, her condition was making it difficult for her to work full-time as a chef in a traditional kitchen.
However, she was snapped up by the Presbyterian Churches of the Wakatipu as the catering manager for their free Pasta Cafe and similar initiatives, Schurmann said.
The role has broadened with the introduction of the Lets Eat programme, another charity initiated by Schurmann, cooking up 400 frozen meals each week for distribution in the community, using food surpluses provided by supermarkets.
Dinesha oversees menu design, stock take, and food safety... The most difficult thing is seeing what food she has to work with in the morning, and coming up with simple recipes for the volunteers to make, Schurmann added.
The family still has a difficult road ahead. Dinesha Wijerathnes health is challenging, they have a $30,000 bill to pay to immigration lawyers, and they are living in a one-bedroom room in the former Queenstown Holiday Park; but Walker believes they deserve to stay.
They have been tax payers in New Zealand for several years and I have no doubt the three boys will go on to became great New Zealanders in whatever field they choose, Schurmann said.
One of them, 12-year-old Subath, knows what he will be: a Black Cap. (Stuff)

Mavai bitterly rues making Viggie CM
Illankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi (ITAK) leader, the main partner of the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), Parliamentarian Mavai Senathirajah said he and his party (ITAK) has undergone suffering for nearly five years because the TNA had made C.V. Vigneswaran the Chief Minister of the Northern Provincial Council.
Addressing a meeting held in the Mullaitivu District, Senathirajah said they had committed a sin by bringing Vigneswaran into politics from the TNA. Senadhiraja said he himself was largely responsible for committing that sin.
Senathirajah said that Vigneswaran had made an allegation against the TNA in the last few days. It was Vigneswaran and Gajendra Ponnambalam who told them to reject the interim report on the new Constitution.
That was because Vigneswaran did not wish to see the TNA resolving this problem. Although Vigneswaran claimed to be a former Judge, he himself had a contempt of court case against him. However, they would soon announce their political course of action regarding Vigneswaran and he would request the people to have patience till then.

Milk of original writing
The wait is over. The Booker winner for 2018 has been chosen, though not without attacks coming from naysayers. Anna Burns has become the first Northern Irish author to win the Man Booker prize, taking the 50,000 award for Milkman, her timely, Troubles-set novel about a young woman being sexually harassed by a powerful man.
The experimental novel, Burnss third, is narrated by an unnamed 18-year-old girl, known as middle sister, who is being pursued by a much older paramilitary figure, the milkman. It is incredibly original, according to the Bookers chair of judges, the philosopher Kwame Anthony Appiah.
None of us has ever read anything like this before, said Appiah, announcing the win at a dinner at the Guildhall in London. Anna Burns utterly distinctive voice challenges conventional thinking and form in surprising and immersive prose. It is a story of brutality, sexual encroachment and resistance threaded with mordant humour.
Written with few paragraph breaks, eschewing character names for descriptions, Appiah admitted that Milkman could be seen as challenging, but in the way a walk up Snowdon is challenging. It is definitely worth it because the view is terrific when you get to the top, he said. I spend my time reading articles in the Journal of Philosophy so by my standards this is not too hard. And it is enormously rewarding if you persist with it. Because of the flow of the language and the fact some of the language is unfamiliar, it is not a light read [but] I think it is going to last.
As the award was announced, Burns was lost for words. At the press conference afterwards, the 56-year-old author said her job as a novelist was to show up and be present and attend. Its a waiting process. She just had to wait for my characters to tell me their stories.
Asked about how she had filled the long gap since her 2002 Orange prize listing for No Bones, she said she had done commercial events and moved houses. What will she do with the money Ill clear my debts and live on whats left.
The win makes Burns the first Northern Irish winner  previous Irish winners, including John Banville, Anne Enright and Roddy Doyle, all come from the republic. It also makes her the first female winner since 2013, when Eleanor Catton took the award with The Luminaries.
Burns beat writers including the American literary heavyweight Richard Powers, Daisy Johnson, at 27 the youngest author ever to be shortlisted for the award, and the Canadian writer Esi Edugyan. According to Appiah, the judges, picking from a shortlist that delved into some dark themes, were unanimous in their choice of winner  and not influenced by concerns that picking a third American winner in a row could cause controversy.
Burns, who was born in Belfast and now lives in East Sussex, drew on her own experiences growing up in what she called a place that was rife with violence, distrust and paranoia. As the milkman presses his advances on the reluctant middle sister, rumours begin that she is having an affair with him. But I had not been having an affair with the milkman. I did not like the milkman and had been frightened and confused by his pursuing and attempting an affair with me, Burns narrator tells us.
The Booker prize has the power to transform the winners career and both the Man Booker Prize and Man Booker International are sponsored by Man Group. Man Group was recognised as a partner who mirrored the quality, integrity and longevity of the Booker Prize. The prize underscores Man Groups charitable focus on literacy and education as well as the firms commitment to excellence and entrepreneurship.
Like last years winner, George Saunderss Lincoln in the Bardo, this is a very vocal book. As Appiah said: The pleasure is in the way it sounds. I have read it three times and I will listen to it on audiobook when it becomes available. It is a novel that rewards listening as well as reading. Rewarding is, he thinks, the novels strong point. It is deep, subtle, unpolemical and yes, challenging  challenging in the way that walking up Snowdon is challenging but you get a great view at the top.
The decision, he stressed, was unanimous. Indeed Appiah and his fellow judges  Val McDermid, Leo Robson, Leanne Shapton and Jacqueline Rose  didnt even come to a vote. They had each prepared a ranked list but they were never called on. We had a conversation, said Appiah. We have developed a capacity to reason together. This was our choice. The fact that Burns is a woman and that the novel deals with issues thrown into sharp relief by the MeToo# furore did not enter the judges reasoning. These are themes that are as old as time and not ones specific to the current moment. And nor does the fact that Milkman shows a divided society mean that it specifically references the Irish border question that is dominating the current Brexit negotiations. This, said Appiah, is a book that uses particularity to highlight the universal and one that will last because there will always be disturbances in society and there will always be gossip and rumour.
In the meantime, Burns becomes the 17th female winner in the prizes history and the first Northern Irish writer to win  indeed, although Milkman is her third novel, this is her first major prize. She will find the experience both bewildering and transformative while her publishers, Faber & Faber, will be swinging from the rafters no less vigorously. It is not uncommon for publishers to press the button for reprints while still at the prize dinner table and before the evening comes to an end.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne recently opened a new operating theatre at the Minuwangoda Hospital. The opening of the theatre was delayed for five years, Health Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the new theatre was constructed five years ago but could not be opened due to lack of human resources. Minister Senaratne ordered health officials to provide the required human resources and facilities for the theatre after he was informed about it.
The minister donated medical equipment worth Rs. 2 million to the hospital and promised to provide more facilities such as ambulances and new building complexes to the hospital, he said.
Minister Senaratne said 20 of the 450 new ambulances have been already distributed among state hospitals and another 50 will be distributed next week.

Mobitel demonstrates 5G with commercial infrastructure at Techno 2018
Mobitel, Sri Lankas National Mobile Service Provider once again led Sri Lankas Technological and Digital advancements at Techno 2018. Sri Lankas premier Technology Exhibition showcased the countrys Engineering and Technology prowess, was energized and inspired by Mobitels dazzling demonstration of cutting-edge Communication Services made available for the betterment of all Sri Lankans.
Technology enthusiasts flocked to Mobitels attractive stall which featured a range of its latest unique products, technologies, initiatives and innovations under the theme Connecting the green future which was aligned to Techno 2018s green engineering ethos. Mobitel and Sri Lanka Telecom stepped forward as main sponsors for Techno 2018, which was held from October 12 to 14, 2018 at the BMICH.
Mobitels stall was unique on many fronts. Taking its Connecting the green future theme to heart, the state-of-the-art stall was designed using recyclable material to the greatest extent possible. Moreover, the stall was highly interactive and engaging for visitors because Mobitel held demonstrations of its latest technologies, initiatives and innovations.
Leading the way in 5G in Sri Lanka, Mobitel publicly demonstrated Sri Lankas first 5G deployment over 3.5GHz, globally recognized as the primary frequency band for 5G, showcasing the exponential growth in broadband speeds which Mobitel will provide to its customers in the near future. This 5G Massive MIMO (Multiple Input Multiple Output) technology demonstration utilized 64x64 MIMO configuration with commercially available user devices and commercially available network equipment, dispelling doubts over its short term viability, and thereby leading Sri Lankas progress ahead of many technology advanced nations worldwide. Mobitel is grateful for the support and encouragement given by the Director General of Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) and his officers to industry players in their efforts in making advancements in the industry.
Sri Lankas national mobile service provider, Mobitel, occupies the foremost position in cutting-edge mobile telecommunication technology in Sri Lanka. Its revolutionary path to the forefront of the industry is peppered with many pioneering technologies that have paved the way for other mobile operators to follow in its wake. In fact, the rest of the industry takes its cue from products and services introduced by Mobitel. Trail-blazing 5G in Sri Lanka having demonstrated 5G with commercial infrastructure at Techno 2018, Mobitel is poised to be the first mobile operator in Sri Lanka to introduce 5G commercially for its customers for faster connectivity and an improved experience.
Despite being the first off the starting blocks with every mobile technology in the recent past, Mobitel, never loses sight of offering sustainable green technology offerings that nurture the nation. While Mobitel has the capability to roll out the very latest mobile technologies, at the same time, it lends a nurturing hand to its customer base in rural areas for whom 2G and 3G technologies are a lifeline. Mobitel understands the needs of its customer segments and caters to them with unfailing precision, while ensuring its investments in the latest technologies continue to enhance the reputation of Sri Lanka as being highly advanced in the region for technological adoption.
Mobitel also publicly demonstrated Voice-over-WiFi (VoWiFi) for the first time in Sri Lanka, the ability to make traditional cellular voice calls over any WiFi hotspot. This is a significant step forward in Sri Lanka, as typical voice calls will be possible in areas of extremely poor Mobile coverage or Not Spots (where owing to environmental conditions or the inability for Mobile signals to penetrate very large buildings), calls can be routed over any available WiFi hotspot.
Having showcased services geared towards the masses, Mobitel also demonstrated communication services suitable for public/administrative services and large scale industries such as Police and Emergency services, Shipping, Railway communications etc. The technology was based on converting traditional analog Walkie-Talkie services over Mobitels island-wide digital LTE network, thereby ensuring enhanced coverage, superior call quality, and also the ability to broadcast video images over push-to-talk (PTT) functions. Following the recent natural disasters in Sri Lanka, Mobitel also trialed an early warning detection system for landslides, thereby encompassing communication from early warning systems to emergency response units.
Furthermore, to cater the growth of Internet of Things (IoT) deployment, Mobitel also demonstrated several NB-IoT (Narrowband IoT) products such as Smart Water Meters.
Finally, in keeping with the Green Technology theme, an app based on the widely popular blockchain technology was commercially launched, whereby anyone could plant a tree and track its growth over its lifetime, thereby earning carbon credits which could be traded for free data bundles on Mobitels network.
Mobitel CEO, Nalin Perera said, Mobitels 3-pronged initiative which improved the lifestyle and digital empowerment of 1) its retail customers, 2) the public services/ large scale industries and finally 3) pioneering Sri Lankas Sustainable and Green initiatives based on its technology service offerings and acknowledged the support extended by the Telecommunications Regulatory Authority of Sri Lanka for the creating the right environment for the growth and sustainability of the industry. Mobitel had once again delivered real-life solutions with tangible benefits to every Sri Lankan and also for advancing Sri Lankas digital initiatives, in keeping with Sri Lankas digital vision for the country.

National Science Foundation marks 50 years
The National Science Foundation (NSF) of Sri Lanka celebrates an unrivaled landmark of 50 years of service to the nation as Sri Lankas foremost enabler of science, technology and innovation, under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The countrys apex body powering the execution of scientific research and popularization of science is looking to keep the momentum of empowering Sri Lankan talent and genius through continued government endorsements and investment.
We are proud to be part of an institution that has for half a century contributed towards the steady intellectual and technological evolution of our country, said Director General of the NSF, Prof. Ananda Jayawardane.
As the premier driving force in promoting scientific research and innovation for social prosperity in Sri Lanka, the NSF offers an array of grants under basic and applied research, technology and other areas to supplement the financial, physical and manpower resources available in science & technology institutions.
This resulted in the Foundation initiating a National Thematic Research Program (NTRP) that delivers solid and noticeable outputs for socio-economic development in the country, covering key areas that require immediate attention. Technology grants are provided for technology development and startup businesses leveraging innovation to meet future demands. This leads to Intellectual property (IP) creation and technology transfer with further support extended in various forms to protect and manage IP.
Communicating a message of continued learning, the NSF has nurtured a solid intellectual foundation across Sri Lanka by facilitating the establishment of Science Associations in over 900 schools across the island. These associations and practices have since been followed up in universities and research institutions in the country. This drive is further strengthened by the circulation of monthly editorials on science and technology published by the NSF  Vidurawa, and monographs supporting in the establishment of a knowledge-based society in Sri Lanka. The quarterly issued peer-reviewed publication, the Journal of the National Science Foundation of Sri Lanka and the Sri Lanka Journal of Social Sciences add further value to the scientific knowledge base in the country. The NSF is also behind one of the most advanced, and highly comprehensive knowledge gathering projects in the region  the National Digitization Project, a five-year old project established in 2013 that has seen the digitization of a staggering 3 million science and technology related volumes, manuscripts and books to create an encyclopedic online database for academics and stakeholders to benefit from the distribution of unparalleled knowledge.
Mobitel the leading mobile service provider in Sri Lanka and Commercial Bank  one of Sri Lankas foremost private banking institutions, have joined in the celebrations as Principal Sponsors of the event. Other sponsors of the jubilee celebration includes Sri Lanka Technological Campus (SLTC), National Institute of Business Management (NIBM), Sri Lanka Insurance, Bank of Ceylon (BOC), BOC Travels, Peoples Travel and Expo graphics.

New Bill significantly improves on PTA - HRW
Sri Lankas draft counterterrorism law significantly improves upon the current Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) but needs further safeguards against rights violations, Human Rights Watch (HRW) said in a statement released on Sunday.
Parliament should amend the Bill to fully comply with international human rights standards and resist pressure to roll back its reforms, HRW said.
The statement went on to say the Counterterrorism Act of 2018, drafted to replace the PTA, narrows the definition of terrorism, increases protections against torture and coerced confessions, and reduces pretrial detention. But overbroad provisions could be used to prohibit peaceful protests and ban nongovernmental organisations. Curbs on police powers remain insufficient.
The Sri Lankan government has finally addressed the Prevention of Terrorism Act, but the proposed law needs stronger human rights protections, said Letta Tayler, senior terrorism and counterterrorism researcher at Human Rights Watch. Parliament should reject attempts to add abusive clauses and pass a bill that advances the rule of law.
The Cabinet of Ministers submitted the draft law to Parliament on October 9. Media reports suggest that there is pressure within Parliament to reduce the Bills rights protections. Measures reportedly under consideration would include restoring the Prevention of Terrorism Acts use of confessions to police as evidence in court, the statement said.
Sri Lanka has agreed to calls by the United Nations Human Rights Council and the European Union to repeal the current law as part of the governments accountability and reconciliation measures for abuses during the war. The government has yet to carry out most reforms pledged to the Human Rights Council in its 2015 resolution, the HRW said.
Parliament should bring the draft law into full compliance with international human rights standards in a transparent and participatory process, Human Rights Watch said. The law should automatically lapse after two years, with renewal to be considered after an assessment of its impact on human rights.
The Attorney Generals Office should review all PTA prosecutions that are tainted by credible evidence of torture or other abuse and provide redress for violations. It should also prosecute and hold to account all law enforcement and other government officials implicated in the abuse of terrorism suspects, the HRW said.
After years of stalling, Sri Lanka finally appears poised to scrap its discredited Prevention of Terrorism Act, Tayler said. The government should start demonstrating its seriousness about breaking with past abuses by strengthening its new counterterrorism bill.

New political dimensions in the offing
The President has strengthened his security at last. It was several weeks since the story about a conspiracy to assassinate him and the ex-Defence Secretary was reported in the media. That it took so long to strengthen the security of no less a person than the President of the Republic is a sad testimony to the unsatisfactory state of the security situation. The security of the ex-Defence Secretary has not been reported so far. Security of individuals does not and should not depend on their political allegiances or ideological positions.
What should have been done at the outset was to entrust the State investigative and intelligence services to pursue the matter discreetly and professionally untrammeled by any political or other pressures. Our intelligence and investigative authorities have proved their metal more than once.
Instead what resulted was a public debate with every Tom Dick and Harry contributing their two pence worth opinions and judgements. What mattered worse was that the high-ranking Police Officer who was allegedly involved in the conspiracy not only remained at large but was also given a certificate of good conduct by the Minister and even the IGP. Nor did the authorities budge even when a sophisticated fire-arm in his custody disappeared. It was only after the CID and the Government Analyst confirmed some audio recordings as those of that officer that the authorities reluctantly took even preventive disciplinary action.
Clarify matters
The much vocal leader of the National Freedom Front went as far as blaming the whole episode on the intelligence services of neighbouring India and called an Indian national whose name has also come up in the statement of the informant an agent of RAW (the Indian intelligence Agency). He even gave his alleged RAW Identification Number as if its operatives carried an identity card in their pockets or round their necks like the Black Tigers who carried a cyanide capsule round their necks! The fact that the Indian High Commission identified the man and said he was mentally deranged also did not help to clarify matters.
The story came back with a bang when the The Hindu, mass circulation Indian newspaper reported on the testimony of four Cabinet Ministers a story that President Maithripala Sirisena has allegedly told the Cabinet that RAW was behind attempts to assassinate him. It is doubtful whether a prestigious newspaper such as The Hindu would have published the story without reference to relevant Indian authorities. The fact that its Chairman N. Ram stood by the story despite the denial by the Presidents office confirms our doubts.
President Sirisena in desperation would have referred to the assassination attempt at the Cabinet meeting and he may have been misquoted or misreported. The President not only denied that he mentioned RAW by name or meant that India is involved both when the Indian High Commissioner met him and when he telephoned Prime Minister Modi in New Delhi. Thus, an unfortunate diplomatic stand-off was averted though a bitter taste would remain in the mouth.
Cabinet meeting
As acknowledged by the President himself political differences in the Cabinet could have persuaded the Ministers to speak to the media about what happened or what purported to have happened at the Cabinet meeting. In any case it was a breach of responsibility. In view of the public acrimony and trading accusations between the two wings of the united Government what would have surprised the public was if no such irresponsibility was displayed.
This is the Achilles Heel of the yahapalana Government.
The Joint Opposition did not help either. They made use of the opportunity to promote an unprincipled alliance between the political forces represented by the President and the former President in a desperate attempt to push for a new coalition government with Mahinda as PM under President Sirisena. A very rare possibility given the opposition to such a formation from the TNA and the JVP, leave alone any others. A much likely scenario in such a situation would be the UNP going it alone with or without the assistance of a dozen dissidents from the JO and the official SLFP.
Sri Lanka is in an unenviable strategic position between two regional giants in the Indian Ocean region. With a long history of ethnic, political and cultural relations spanning up to pre-historic times India is our closest neighbour. Probably the two countries would have been a single land mass at one time. Situated midway between the trade routes between East and West Asia, Sri Lanka has had very intimate trade, economic, political and cultural links with China throughout history.
Asian giants
In the context of the geopolitical situation in the present day the significance of maintaining good relations with both Asian giants is of paramount importance. One has also to reckon with efforts taken by the United States of America, Israel, Japan and Australia and India to form an axis of powers counter to China and to some extent Russia.
Given the apparent inclination shown by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe towards this axis Sri Lanka is in the danger of losing its non-aligned position in the world. However, it is the weakening of the economy of the West the dwindling amount of Western economic aid and investments coupled with the rise of China as a world economic power that has compelled the Government to turn to China for aid.
Hence, it would be not only foolish but suicidal to be drawn into any anti-Chinese axis. On the other hand, the best policy would be to revive our non-aligned foreign policy and without being dragged into any side under pressure.
Unfortunately, the division within the Government could assist the external powers, and extreme caution and mature diplomacy is the need of the hour instead of the megaphone diplomacy practiced by some politicians.

Notes in harmony
Friends in Harmony (FIH) orchestra presented an enjoyable and entertaining concert at the Russian Cultural Centre, on October 11.
Fifteen members including instrumentalists and singers were on stage. FIH orchestra consists of 46 players and singers, mostly professionals of diverse disciplines, who have got together for the love of music. The theme of the concert was UNITY. This was clearly demonstrated by all on stage representing a multi-ethnic mix enjoying unity as a team and harmony in their performance. The spirit of unity was further enhanced effectively in words by the compere, Ashan Algama who is also an accomplished musician.
Friends in Harmony Unity Concert displayed their versatility in presenting an enjoyable programme of selections from their wide repertoire ranging from evergreen Semi-Classics, Broadway favorites, Latin American music, haunting melodies and popular music across the world, Hindi music, waltzes and dance music, and the much loved Sri Lankan Sinhala and Tamil golden oldies and Bailas.
Friends in Harmony Concert was a special performance in which the audience showed that they were at ease to participate from time to time by singing along, clapping, tapping and swaying to the music. This was clearly visible from the spontaneous response of the audience especially when Dr. Prashanthi Mendis (Ethno-musicologist and Lawyer by profession and Co-Director of FIH) accompanied by the accomplished musician - Mrs. Indrani Wijesundera (Director of FIH) began her selection of pieces with a truly brilliant performance of In the Mood followed by Kimada Nawe and Cherry Pink and Apple Blossom White on the Caribbean Steel Drums which is an unusual musical instrument for this part of the world on which any music from the East to West can be played.
An extraordinary rendition of the romantic Sinhala song Ganga Addara of Nimal Mendis popularized by late Vijaya Kumatunga was effectively delivered with a great deal of feeling by Dr. Prashanthi Mendis on the Caribbean Steel Drums in the second half of the programme. One verse was sung beautifully by the accomplished singer (and medical doctor)  Dr. Nilanka Wickremasinghe while Prashanthi played the drums. They were effectively accompanied by Mrs. Indrani Wijesundera. This rendition was indeed a charming and unique interpretation which was greatly appreciated by the audience.
The brilliant solo renditions of Love Changes Everything and Sound of Music by Dr. Nilanka Wickremasinghe were enjoyed tremendously by the audience with much applause. The other special vocal renditions which added color to the concert, to name a few, were the duets of Victor and Lancelot, Damian and Hashan.
Kandy Perahera done by Friends in Harmony orchestra with an entry by Akila from the entrance of the concert hall to the stage playing the Tammattama Drums was another unique item on the programme which was enjoyed by the audience.
The programme included a sing along and baila dancing with audience participation.
The grand finale was the audience standing up, crossing their hands and joining the Friends in Harmony Orchestra and Singers by singing Auld Lang Syne with a cheerful spirit of unity.

Oil, Gas prospecting in Mannar Basin commences
Natural Gas and Oil prospecting in the Mannar Basin of the Sri Lanka Maritime Zone commenced yesterday. The ship BGP-Pioneer is engaged in this operation, Petroleum Resources, Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said.
The Minister said the ship commenced exploration of data in the JS-05 and JS-06 zones on March 30.
The ship BGP Pioneer arrived in the Mannar Basin yesterday after successfully completing the exploration.
Addressing a special press conference, Minister Ranatunga said the ship would be gathering data about the availability of Natural gas and oil deposists using two dimension quakes within the next three weeks.
These operations are conducted by the Petroleum Resources Development Secretariat. Already, three basins had been identified as having oil deposits.
They are M-01 to M-10 in the Mannar Basin C-1 to C-5 in the Carvery Basin and JS 01 to JS 06 in the Lanka Basin. They would again be separated as blocks. The prospecting is done by SCHLUMBERGER Company which signed a multipurpose agreement with him.
The agreement signed with TOTAL had to be shelved due to the failure to find a company providing relevant services. Their intention was to formulate initial plans for drilling after finding natural gas and oil deposits.

Omentra.com holds talk show on how  to Disrupt, Thrive through Innovation
The second in the Omentra Talk Show series 58 minutes with held recently at the Chartered Accountants Auditorium with Nathan Sivagananathan, Chief Growth Officer and member Apparel Board at MAS Holdings as it s key note speaker, once again concluded on a high note, with many of the participants requesting for similar talk shows in the future.
Nathan spoke on the topic of Disrupt and Thrive through Innovation. He began the discussion by outlining that disruption today is having a direct impact on technology, business strategies and decision-makers in every industry and that its fuelling innovation.
He said that therefore future business leaders needed several things to succeed, which included the right talent, focus on both innovation and operational excellence, and the agility to adapt quickly to changes all around them. This he said will enable companies to hedge against sudden industry disruption and pivot toward new opportunities and continually remain at the forefront of disruptive innovation, regardless of where those disruptive forces originate.
Therefore companies that understand how to harness the power of disruption are the ones that will still be operational beyond the next couple of years, said Nathan.
Nathan further explained that leaders of companies need to challenge their management teams and work-forces to revisit their products and processes, and to look outside the traditional enterprise walls for innovative approaches. He said that peer-to-peer innovation, just like peer-to-peer networking, benefits from pooling resources and talent is becoming more and more popular thanks to the sharing economy. New technology tools, new methods to innovate and new revenue models can all be managed and tied together to become a lever to innovate and grow.
He added that a company must consciously decide how to position their capabilities to stay continually relevant. They must be willing to plan for the future with a focus on capabilities that appeal to a broader and more diverse array of potential clients. Companies must also learn to adopt digital solutions to foster real-time collaboration with partners, customers and even competitors. In doing so, they reexamine both their entrenched business processes and their corporate culture in order to make them effective and relevant.
Citing examples from his own company Nathan gave an insight to the audience of the innovative projects undertaken by MAS to understand the evolving market landscape and in reaching out to the customer of the future.
In conclusion he stated that the message to take way from the discussion was clear. It meant that disruption isnt new but is everywhere and businesses need to remain innovative and agile to survive. He said, The most innovative companies thrive when people disrupt themselves. Therefore the only survival methodology today is to Innovate, Disrupt and Grow!

Fifth and final ODI v England
Our training is targeting the World Cup not todays game - Dickwella
With another ODI series loss this time to England who hold onto an unassailable 3-0 lead, Sri Lanka are concentrating their energies on making an impact in the next World Cup more than todays fifth and final ODI which takes place under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium.
All four ODIs have been affected by bad weather and todays game will be no different with the rains still continuing to torment the Englishmen who have not had a full 100-over match in the series although they have already sealed it and made this contest a dead rubber.
As a team we train hard. Our preparation has been good. We are looking at the World Cup. We have about ten games before the World Cup. We have improved no doubt. We just need to win one game, said Sri Lankas wicket-keeper batsman Niroshan Dickwella at the pre-match press conference yesterday.
We won two games against South Africa but that wasnt good enough to win the series. We are trying to make an impact in the World Cup and our training is targetting that more than tomorrows game.
Batting has been a big concern for Sri Lanka in the series but in the fourth ODI at Pallekele on Saturday they clicked for the first time running up an impressive 273-7 only to see the game being decided on the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule.
It was a good effort scoring 273. It was a slow wicket and turning as well. As I said at the last media briefing, the top order and middle order has to click to help us to get to a big total. As a batting unit, we did well. We didnt lose by a big margin. Satisfied with the effort. The no-ball and rain and then Duckworth/Lewis came into play that is why we lost, said Dickwella.
The match would have been a closer contest than it turned out to be had Sri Lanka not made the costly mistake of having an extra fielder outside the 30-yard circle. That lapse on their part deprived them of Joe Roots wicket as the ball was declared a no-ball.
Root and skipper Eoin Morgan carried England to a comprehensive series clinching eight-wicket win.
This is a game of awareness. That can happen. We are human. But we cannot afford that to happen. Those are silly mistakes. We need to avoid them when we are trying to win tight games. When we commit mistakes like that it is tough to win, said Dickwella.

Simply Abstract, an art exhibition by the students of Elizabeth Moir Senior School took place on September 29 at the JDA Perera Art Gallery, Horton Place, Colombo 7.
The students explored the full breadth of the abstract theme with creativity and enthusiasm said Art Teacher Aruni Wijegunawardene.
This medium gives artists a great deal of freedom to use their imaginations and the students did exactly that. They were also given a mandate to think sustainable and to recycle and upcycle wherever possible. They were very creative in this regard as well which was delightful to see.
The Schools Inter-house art competition was part of the exhibition under the theme People who have made a difference and brought a positive change in our lives. The four Houses were free to choose one or more famous faces to feature in their artwork, and the murals included Audrey Hepburn, Malala Yousufzai, Pablo Picasso, Princess Diana, Malcolm X and more. Each house also selected a Sri Lankan influencer, with Hillary choosing Otara Gunewardene, Fleming selecting Mahela Jayawardene, Columbus opting for Kumari Jayawardene and Armstrong featuring D S Senanayake. The students produced an exceptional range of artwork in many mediums including portraits, paintings, digital artwork, photography, sculpture and more.
Artist and designer Sonali Dharmawardena was Chief Guest at the event. Speaking about the task of judging the competition, she praised the students for the overall excellent standard of their pieces, and said that everyone deserved a prize for their hard work and creativity.
Miu Otsuki won first place in the Junior category with Rayyan Hameed in second and Aatikah Rizwan in third place. Winners in the Senior category were Kaavya Gnanam in first place, with Zaara Kulatunga and Reanna Bakshini in second and third place respectively.
In the overall competition, Fleming took first place, with Hillary in second and Armstrong and Columbus in third and fourth place respectively. Armstrong received special mention for their use of the most number of recycled items.
The exhibition also featured work by the schools current Lower 6 class, all of whom gained A* and A grades at the IGCSE Art exams.

Partly 'A HELICOPTER MOM' !
Kajol, who is next seen in Helicopter Eela, in which she plays the role of an interfering mother of a teenage son, says that shes a little bit like her onscreen character IRL.
Kajol is married to actor filmmaker Ajay Devgn (who is also producing Kajols film) and they are parents to a daughter Nysa, 15, and son Yug, 8.
Speaking to NDTVs Anjilee Istwal, Kajol said that she is partly a helicopter mom but Ajay Devgn is definitely a helicopter dad.
Kajol said, Im not as exaggerated as Eela but Im partly a helicopter mom and happier for it.
Kajol also said that between her and Ajay Devgn she is the bad cop when dealing with their children.
But now he (Ajay Devgn) has realized its important to be a bad cop too and that its not okay to say okay all the time. Hes also understood that he cannot wait for the mom to be a bad cop, Kajol added.Kajol was asked about her daughters name, to which Kajol said, Ajay named Nysa. We had decided to name our daughter Nysa long before she was born.
Explaining the significance of Nysas name, kajol said: Nysa is the name of the Greek goddess of purity. It was also a settlement on the banks of Indus River at some point. There are many mythological meanings... but its basically the Greek goddess of purity.
Several star kids such as Janhvi Kapoor (daughter of Sridevi and Boney Kapoor), Ananya Panday (daughter of Chunky and Bhavana Panday) and Sara Ali Khan (daughter of Saif Ali Khan and Amrita Singh) have recently Bollywood. Everyone also knows that its only a matter of time that Suhana Khan (daughter of Shah Rukh and Gauri Khan) will join films.
Therefore, no one was surprised when Kajol was asked if she would encourage her daughter to join films.
Kajol said, If Nysa wants to become an actor Ill encourage her. Ill back her choice. Ill encourage her in whatever she wants to make of her life not what I want her do in her life. My kids have never stopped me from going to work or take or reject a film... My daughter is proud of me and thats my biggest award... thats my biggest recognition.

Paying homage TO ITS PAST
Halloween will be releasing on October 26 at Liberty by Scope Cinemas, Empire  Colombo, MC Cinemas  Colombo, Milano  Kegalle, Scope Cinemas (CCC)  Colombo 3, Regal  Gampaha / Nuwara Eliya, Savoy Colombo 4, Aruna  Kiribatgoda, Rauoo  Katunayaka, Cinemax Ja-Ela, Liberty Lite, NIT- Ratnapura/Kurunagala, New Minerwa  Kalutara, Sky Lite Malabe, and Queens - Galle
Theres no mincing words in the new Halloween when it comes to the franchise in which the film exists. Early on, one character asks the granddaughter of Laurie Strode if its true that Laurie and the famed serial killer Michael Myers were sister and brother; the granddaughter replies with a disdainful No, clarifying that its just a silly rumor people made up as they built up the legend of Michael Myers as much as the man and his murders ever could. That surprise was built into the 1981 sequel Halloween II, one of the many films in the series that is roundly (and smartly) ignored in this latest revival, which carves out a new space to occupy and flourish.
For the purposes of this new film, directed and co-written by David Gordon Green, with John Carpenter on board as executive producers, all that matters is the first Halloween. The new film is a direct sequel to the 1978 classic; in that film, Laurie Strode (Jamie Lee Curtis, of course) was an innocent teenager whose babysitting job on Halloween turned into a fight for survival against an implacable, hard-to-kill murderer who was hell-bent on making her evening a nightmare. In this slow-burn follow-up, Laurie has spent 40 years suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder while concurrently planning her revenge against the infamous monster. When Michael Myers is set to be transferred to a maximum-security facility on  of course  Halloween, he manages to escape and head back to Haddonfield, Illinois to wreak more bloody carnage and face off with his surviving victim.
The hallmarks of the first Halloween are very much on display in the new one, from the obvious to the more esoteric and fan-service-y. Of course, Carpenters chilling theme makes its return (the iconic director co-composed the score), and there are a number of long takes meant to evince the sense of an off-screen perpetrator watching and stalking its prey. Some of the references and in-jokes are direct reversals or deliberate echoes of what happened in the first film. As in the 1978 film, one of the young women (Virginia Gardner) who becomes targeted by Michael is babysitting a young charge who watches an old-school genre film on TV before the horror hits home. And the fiery climax features a face-off between Laurie and Michael that switches their roles from the final moments of the first film: Laurie, this time, is the one stalking Michael, and shes the one who seems to vanish before his eyes after being tossed out the second floor of a house.

President inaugurates Galle Dialogue International Maritime Conference 2018
The Galle Dialogue International Maritime Conference 2018 organised by the Sri Lanka Navy for the ninth consecutive year commenced yesterday at the Galle Face Hotel in Colombo.
President Maithripala Sirisena graced the occasion as the Chief Guest at the inaugural session.
State Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardene, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC, Chief of Defence Staff Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne and a number of local and foreign delegates graced the occasion. Navy Commander Vice Admiral S. S. Ranasinghe received the Chief Guest to the conference held under the theme Synergizing for collaborative maritime management.
The Galle Dialogue International Maritime Conference was organised by the Sri Lanka Navy since 2010 under the patronage of the Ministry of the Defence.
The purpose of this conference is to provide a common platform for stake holders of national and international repute to discuss and deliberate maritime related issues. Moreover, specifically enhance the cooperation of maritime security and sharing of knowledge and information amongst them.
President Maithripala Sirisena in his message on this occasion said a conference such as this, has special significance for nations such as Sri Lanka engaged in the rapid expansion of maritime activities. Sri Lanka is geographically located close to a very important international maritime route and is working towards becoming a naval hub in the Indian Ocean. Hence, I strongly believe the deliberations at this conference will be immensely useful for Sri Lanka to progress towards achieving the desired objectives.
Delivering the welcome address, Navy Commander S.S. Ranasinghe said the first seminar was held in 2010 with the intention of sharing Sri Lankas experiences of countering maritime terrorism, particularly irregular warfare at sea and lessons learnt, with the rest of the world, after eradicating 30 years of terrorism that plagued the island.
Thereafter, subsequent conferences set the stage to discuss maritime security challenges and ways of overcoming them through constructive, collaborative and cooperative partnerships.
The Galle Dialogue was attended by 146 delegates representing 52 countries and 22 international organizations as well as defence industries.
The Navy Commander noted; Since our region is very much prone to natural disasters, it is important to discuss Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief. Further, Maritime Domain Awareness in terms of maritime security is also very significant in this forum to have a dialogue.
Being an island nation located in a central position of the Indian Ocean, adopting a Blue Economy is not optional but mandatory for Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has advantages, but also faces challenges due to its position. The major advantages for a Blue Economy include a unique geographical position, high accessibility to ocean resources from a lengthy coastline around the country, closeness to major sea lanes, sovereignty over a significant area of sea compared with the countrys land resources, a diverse range of coastal and marine ecosystems and a high potential for tourism and recreation industries, he said.
However, he pointed out that these opportunities also have challenges attached to them. The oceans around the country are highly contested by global powers and being a small player in a global political arena, he warned that Sri Lanka therefore, has to take a cautious path.
Approximately 80% of the pollution in the oceans comes from land, and coastal zones are especially vulnerable to pollutants. Plastics are also particularly problematic with enormous floating rubbish patches forming in the oceans. Climate change and its related impacts, such as ocean acidification, are affecting the survival of some marine species. Coastal development is destroying and degrading important coastal marine ecosystems such as coral reefs, sea grass meadows and mangroves. We need clean and healthy oceans to support our own health and survival, even if we dont live anywhere near them, the Navy Commander said.
He highlighted the necessity of protecting our future generation by giving them the best opportunity to live in a peaceful and uncorrupted environment. Therefore, he said, maritime strategies must be developed as collective strategies to address common issues.
This could be achieved by sharing resources, knowledge, technology and mutual understanding among each other, he said, adding that great power competition with maritime power projection could be used as a tool for helping nations instead of an individual attempt to achieve their strategic objectives.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 07
Research your new market  terrain before stepping into it
Perhaps, this instalment might be the most important chapter in the whole series. Why Because everything else, from selecting the business and marketing it to growing and even eventually selling it, hinges on having an accurate understanding of your market.
If you do not get this piece of the foundation wrong, and a lot more will go wrong- but get it right, and the future of your business can be lot smoother.
The need for market research
You may be anxious to get started, but you cannot start, not just yet. What you need to do instead is sit back, do your research, and think. It may be that your idea is a winner, but then again, maybe it is not. The key is to analyse your idea and the market for it.And then, make sure that you are not the only one who thinks you have a great business idea. Remember, great entrepreneurs endeavour to reduce their risk as much as possible.
Is quitting your comfortable job and starting a business fun and exciting It might be. But you simply cannot do that without having a fairly accurate idea about what your small business is going to be, who your customers will be, why they will buy from you and not someone else, and how much money you can reasonably expect to make.
Learn that, and quitting your job becomes much less risky. The bottom line, then, is that market research is critical. Before you quit your job, before you put your hard-earned money into an untried business concept, before you risk your and your familys future, make sure that your idea is feasible.
Find a need and solution
It seems simple: if people are willing to pay for the product or service you want to sell, your business has a very good chance of success. But this creates a question. Are there people who want or need what you have to sell How much will they pay for it Why would they choose you Will your idea fly If there is no one around who wants your proposed product or service, your business will fail.
Success secret
Do you want to know the secret of successful business It is amazingly simple. People will pay you to fulfil their needs or solve their problems. If you can solve a problem better than anyone else, you will make a lot of money. The catch is figuring out what your customers needs are.
For example. is there a market for a Lunch & Dinner Restaurant in your town Why will people choose you over the three other restaurants What can you offer that they do not Market research will give you the anwrs. Analysing the market is a way to gather facts about potential customers and to determine the demand for your product or service.
The more information you gather, the greater your chances of capturing a segment of the market.
3 Cs of your new business
Any new business should give full attention to three factors: Company, Customers, and Competitors.
What is your company going to do Answer the following questions to evaluate your potential business or product: Have you considered all the advantages or benefits of your idea Is there a real need for it Have you pinpointed the exact problems or difficulties your idea is expected to solve
Is your idea an original, new concept, or is it a new combination or adaptation What immediate or short-range gains or results can be anticipated Are the projected returns adequate Are the risk factors acceptable What long-range benefits can be anticipated Have you checked the idea for faults or limitations Are there any problems the idea might create
What are the changes involved How simple or complex will the ideas execution or implementation be Could you work out several variations of the idea Could you offer alternative ideas Does your idea have a natural sales appeal Is the market ready for it Can customers afford it Will they buy it Is there a timing factor
What, if anything, is your competition doing in this area Can your company be competitive Have you considered the possibility of user resistance or difficulties Does your idea fill a real need, or does the need have to be created through promotional and advertising efforts How soon could the idea be put into operation
Who will your customers be Will you be selling to other businesses or to individuals Are your customers going to be young or old Poor or affluent Men or women Blue or white collar How big is the market What do your potential customers need Why would they buy it from you What do they want and will they pay for it How can you get them to change vendors How can you reach them What do they read and watch The more you crystallize your thinking, the more specific you are about who you are trying to reach, and the more you know about that market, the greater the chance that you will be able to find and entice them to patronize your business.
Who will be your competitors What are they doing right and wrong What are their strengths and weaknesses How can you capitalize on their weaknesses Why would their customers leave and come to you Can you undersell them Do you want to
There are two possible outcomes of this research. Either you will discover that there is a need for your service, or you will find there is not. All is not lost if it is bad news. It may be that your idea simply needs to be tweaked.
Take two
Before you abandon your idea altogether, see whether you can make it work. Those moments of clarity in which great ideas materialize are not to be dismissed lightly. Insights are valuable, and often you need only track down the right research to figure out how the puzzle pieces may fit together.
The key, once again, is to divorce yourself as much as possible from your love of this idea and to view it as objectively as possible. Put on your sceptical hat and put away those rose-coloured glasses. What you need now is20/20 vision.
Where to find the information,
Here are your best bets.
(1) Trade Associations: Every industry has a trade association connected to it, and these groups offer a wealth of information. Find groups associated with your idea and contact them. Explain what you are doing and ask about survey data and research reports that are available. Get copies of their publications.
(2) Trade Shows: Consider attending the leading association trade show. These shows will put you in touch with hundreds of like-minded individuals - people who are already successfully doing what you want to do. Meeting them and picking their brain can: Save you a lot of time.
(3) Trade Magazines:Each industry usually has one or more trade magazines that may or may not be published by the leading trade association. Find the magazine for your industry and get several back copies. You should be able to notice industry trends, mistakes to avoid, potential costs, and much more.
(4) Websites: Aside from the websites mentioned previously, here are a few more that may be helpful at this stage of your entrepreneurial journey. Go for a Google search and check.
(5) Social Media: Social media is a fantastic tool for conducting free market research. For example, on LinkedIn or Facebook you could join groups related to your prospective business, meet people already doing that business and people already succeeding in that industry, and learn what you need to learn. By searching on Twitter, you can also find people in any industry. Connecting with these folks can be invaluable and costs you nothing but time.
(6) Interviews and experiential research
There are two groups of people you need to meet and interview:
(a) Potential customers: Finding customers for your potential business is not the easiest task in the world, but it must be done.

Retirement plans for senior citizens from NDB Wealth
Commemorated recently, the United Nations International Day of Older Persons is a day to appreciate the contributions of older people to society. In celebrating this important day, it is best to also take this opportunity to plan for your retired parents future, which is only a very small way of paying them back for all they have done for you. So they can live a full, comfortable and healthy life in their sunset years.
In fact, the most amazing way to secure your elderly parents future is undoubtedly an investment in a Money Plus account from expert financial planner NDB Wealth.
According to Shenelle Cassim, a Financial Advisor at NDB Wealth, Depositing or saving a lump sum in our Money Plus account is the most convenient and uncomplicated way to ensure a monthly cash flow or a regular monthly income for your parents, to meet their needs during retirement. Simply, its the easiest way to create a pension for someone, since all the other work related to opening and managing the account is taken care of by the highly experienced team at NDB Wealth. This includes crediting your elders bank account every month without fail so they always have money to spend.
It is noteworthy that the NDB Wealth Money Plus account is ideal for children or guardians who are too busy to keep track of whether the elders they support have the funds they need, when they need them. Additionally, it is tax free, with income credited daily to the elders Money Plus account.
At the same time, and maybe most important of all, the Money Plus account from NDB Wealth works like a savings account that pays rates similar to a fixed deposit. Currently, the Money Plus fund yields 10.90% per annum as at October 11, 2018. However, in an emergency, one can even withdraw all of the money deposited, without a penalty.

Secret to living longer
Eating a piece of citrus fruit every day could help us to avoid cancer, heart disease, dementia and even wrinkles
We all know vitamin C can help fight a cold but it turns out eating a piece of a citrus fruit a day could help to fend off more serious illnesses  including cancer and heart disease.
In their book Eat Better, Live Longer: Understand What Your Body Needs to Stay Healthy, nutritionists Dr Sarah Brewer and Juliette Kellow say citrus fruits are key for a long life.
They say we should aim to eat at least one orange, mandarin, satsuma, grapefruits, lemon or lime a day. The best way to eat the fruits is raw and at room temperature, as they release more juice when they are warm.
The pair also claim that the peel contains considerably more antioxidants than the juice, so we should use the grated zest to add flavour to our food.
ncluding more vitamin C in our diet has various benefits.
It can be used to make collagen, which helps repair tissues, heal wounds and makes our skin look smoother. The nutritionists point to one study of American women that found high intakes of vitamin C reduced wrinkles by 11 per cent.
Vitamin C has also been linked to a reduced risk of heart disease  one study of almost 115,000 adults found that people with the highest amounts of citrus fruits in their diet had a 28 percent reduced risk of stroke.
Citrus fruits can also help to lower cholesterol levels in humans, though Brewer and Kellow recommend eating the whole orange rather than just the juice as most of the hesperidin, the substance thought to lower cholesterol, is found in the white pith and peel.
Numerous studies show diets high in citrus fruits protect against many diseases, including cancer, arthritis, heart disease, cataracts, and diabetes. The evidence suggests citrus fruits may help reduce the risk of cancer of the oesophagus, mouth, larynx, pharynx, and stomach by 40-50 per cent. The protective nutrients of citrus fruits  fibre, vitamin C, potassium, folate and flavonoids  are located in different parts, the nutritionists said.

## Title: Silk Route for global harmony
## Supertitle:

Silk Route for global harmony
Today China is promoting a New Silk Route, a route we have to think of as the path to the most advantageous means of bringing peace and harmony among the countries of Asia and then around the globe. There is so much we can learn from the ancient Silk Route. Back then, it was not just a trade route. It was a major path for philosophical and cultural sharing and exchange. Almost all the trade goods traded along the Silk Route would have disappeared or decayed in a few decades or centuries, but the intangible exchanges continued to be with us to date.
Traders, philosophers, priests, and even common people with an urge to travel, were free to go anywhere they wished, to live for a while or to settle down on any nook or cranny along the Silk Route. This led to human migration far and wide with no hindrance or obstacles except for the geographical or climate barriers. There was no need for passports or visa to leave or enter a country. Often the boundaries were only geographical and there were no border security. There were also no labels of race, creed or caste. There was no concept of a nation state.
Beliefs and practices
It is through the Silk Route that Buddhism spread around the world, first through traders, and later by monks. Tapassu (Trapusa/Tapusa) and Bhalluka (Ballika/Vallika), the two traders from Kalinga Desa (present day Odisha) in North East India were historical personages who first introduced Buddha to Sri Lanka and perhaps to Afghanistan, Myanmar, Cambodia and even China. Paranavithane quotes from Mahavagga and Nidanakatha that the two merchants came from Ukkala (in Odisha) and the stupa was built in their own country. Hieun Tsang, on his journey from Balkh to Bamian in Gandhara noticed the remains of two stupas built over these Hair Relics. The Burmese Buddhists firmly believe that the two merchants enshrined these precious relics in their own Shwe Dagon at Rangoon. These facts about Tapassu and Bhalluka give us an idea of how beliefs and practices of one culture spread from one country to another through this spectacular route connecting the east with the west.
The Silk Route enabled the unique situation in the world, where a people went in search of a philosophy from another country, to the country of origin. With all other religions, even with Buddhism, it has always been the missionaries and the monks who spread the teachings, sometimes even by force, when it comes to some of the revealed religions. It is only in China that we find monks and scholars travelling to India and Sri Lanka, along the Silk Route, probably with the traders, in search of Buddha Dhamma, the Buddhist teachings and literature. And they did not settle down in the countries they travelled to, but went back to their home country again on the Silk Route, to spread the teaching among their own people.
In the same manner the monks from China were welcomed and hosted in South Asia, the monks from South Asia could travel and were welcomed in the Far East and the Near East, and perhaps in East Europe. Some of them settled down in those countries, the way many traders settled down in the countries where they went in for trade. In most instances the traders married women from these countries, from the native groups and settled down. They were accepted by the native people and lived in total peace and harmony. That is how the Muslim traders settled down in Asian countries, from South Asia, India, Sri Lanka, Malaysia, Myanmar, Thailand and even China.
It is time for us to try to bring back to our world the harmony and respect known in the ancient days and clearly visible along the Silk Route. The Silk Route could be used for such convenient travel and exchange of ideas and cultural practices. The frequent travel could create an interest in the various languages used in each country, and it could help to bring down the language barrier, as people pick up these languages. The familiarization and study of the different religions or the different sects of each religion, could help us all to understand each other and the practices and rituals, leading to mutual respect and acceptance of all views. Thus we could reduce the religious and sometimes ethnic conflicts among the people around the world through the new Silk Route.
To ensure such global harmony, the migrants should integrate with the natives, instead of forming little colonies of their own in the host country, because that creates tension and conflict, ethnic, cultural, religious and even economic.
In Sri Lanka we find this cohabitation even with the Chinese people who have been arriving on the Silk Route for the past two millennia or more. One of the major influence of the Chinese has been on our food culture. Chinese food, which was once a luxury is now available in any remote village in Sri Lanka, prepared and consumed by the natives. The Chinese restaurants not only in India, but even in Sri Lanka, are ready to serve Jain vegetarian meals, and there are restaurants even in China serving Islamic Halal food. This kind of cultural integration we find almost everywhere in the world, where the Chinese migrated and settled down travelling as they did along the Silk Route.
Culinary culture
When we talk of culinary culture, the universal beverage which we all consume regularly, and sometimes get addicted to, is tea. Camellia sinensis, according to legend was first known in China as far back as 2737 BCE. Tea is a real cultural bond we all have with China. We could perhaps call the ancient trade route as the Tea Route, rather than the silk route, because tea came to us through the Silk Route and would have been a more popular and more common commodity than Silk.
One of the professions that came to us through the Silk Route is Chinese dentistry. Even today my dental surgeon is a Chinese whose ancestors had arrived in Sri Lanka a few centuries ago. Not surprisingly, we still have a municipal ward called China Garden, very close to the Galle port. When we were young we wondered how the name came about, because the only Chinese we saw in the China Garden were two families - one owned a Chinese restaurant, the other was a Chinese dentist. But today we know back when the Silk Route was in use there probably would have been many Chinese traders who settled down in this part of the Galle town giving it the name, China Garden.
In addition, thanks to the Silk Route Chinese trade goods became a part of our cultural tradition. We find references to Chinese silk as sina pata in graffiti written in the 8th Century on the mirror like wall at Sigiriya. There is a trilingual inscription in the southern town of Galle, written in Chinese, Tamil and Persian, erected in 1411, to commemorate the second visit to Sri Lanka by admiral Zheng He, who commanded seven voyages through the South China seas and the Indian Ocean between 1405 and 1433. The Chinese inscription is in praise of the Buddha, in Tamil to pay homage to god Shiva, and the Persian inscription is in praise to Allah. Of special significance is that admiral Zheng He was of the Islamic faith. There is a huge statue of Zheng He in the Marine Museum in Galle, along with a replica of the inscription.
To reiterate my point I repeat that it is time for us to try to bring back to our world the ancient harmony and respect known in ancient times. I believe that all the countries should join hands with the UNESCO Silk Roads Online Platform to foster a mutual understanding of the diverse and often inter-related cultures that have sprung up among them. We may not be able to dismantle the political barriers, country borders, or the official labels branding us by race or nationality. But we can bring down the other man-made barriers very easily, like the language barrier, by learning each others languages. We can bring down the religious barriers, if we begin to practice our religion in our personal space, without trying to flaunt it by loud and often noisy public festivals, disturbing the other communities, and by not openly trying to convert people. Our motherland should be Mother Earth, not a minute portion of the surface of the earth.
Along the Silk Route we from South Asia gave the world something for the mind, Buddhism, while China gave the whole world something for the stomach, Tea and Chinese food. That is real human integration, with no discrimination by race, creed or caste.
So, let us celebrate this New Silk Route by sharing a cup of tea, with anyone, irrespective of their nationality, race, creed or caste, even if we cannot speak in the same tongue. For, this golden liquid which can be called a universal equalizer came to us along the Silk Route.

SL FORUM PROVIDES NEW PERSPECTIVES ON HOW TRAVEL, TOURISM CAN MEET UN SDGS
Over 100 senior executives from the Sri Lankan travel and tourism industry and beyond attended an insightful forum on October 11, designed to set new directions for the industry and align it comprehensively with the UN Sustainable Development Goals.
Jointly organized by Jetwing Hotels and the Bangkok-based online publication Travel Impact Newswire (TIN), the forum was the first of its kind in Asia. It featured a detailed presentation on global social, economic and geopolitical trends by Imtiaz Muqbil, Executive Editor of TIN, followed by a discussion on how each of the 17 UN SDGs can be applied to make travel & tourism a part of the solution.
In his opening remarks, Hiran Cooray, Chairman, Jetwing Symphony PLC said, The global travel and tourism industry is entering a new era in which it is unfortunately seen as being a part of the problem due to its environmental impact. This presents a golden opportunity for Sri Lankan travel and tourism to adopt the UN SDGs as a new business model for future growth, and hence become an intrinsic part of the solution.
Imtiaz Muqbil, Executive Editor, Travel Impact Newswire
Jetwing has contributed significantly over the years to the advancement of Sri Lankan tourism through job-creation, income distribution, environmental conservation and the promotion of gender equality. This forum is designed to bring the entire Sri Lankan travel and tourism industry on board and put all hands-on deck, he added.
In his presentation, Imtiaz noted that as one of the Asia-Pacific regions longest-serving travel trade journalists, with extensive experience in covering the regional offices of nearly all the UN agencies based in Bangkok, he has seen travel and tourism being hit by numerous internal and external factors as well as Acts of God and man-made crises.
With a few exceptions such as Bhutan, no Asian country can claim to have crafted a tourism development model that balances the benefits of travel and tourism and mitigates its negative consequences. As a country that has now embarked upon national rebuilding after 25 years of internal conflict, Sri Lanka has a unique last-mover advantage to learn from the successes and failures of other Asian countries and get it right in developing a future model for its travel and tourism sector, he added.
Imtiaz gave a comprehensive and realistic wrap-up of global social, economic and geopolitical challenges and their impact on travel and tourism. Offering an alternative perspective on how civil society groups, which represent the lower-income population groups, feel about issues like climate change and its root causes, he also discussed the consequences of other money-draining challenges such as tax evasion, alcoholism and militarism.
He said, The fact that this forum was organized entirely by the private sector, free of any involvement by government agencies or international travel associations, made it possible to have a forthright and frank discussion in which nothing was off the table. That is what made this forum a real game-changer compared to others which prefer to stay within the traditional comfort-zone topics.
It also reflected the maturity of private sector groups such as Jetwing which are genuinely serious about fulfilling all 17 UN SDGs comprehensively and holistically, not just selectively.
The forum saw some creative ideas being raised to help Sri Lanka more strongly link its travel and tourism growth model with the UN SDGs. These were further refined in a panel discussion with Dilhan C. Fernando, CEO, Dilmah, Ranjith Pandithage, Chairman/Managing Director, DIM), Sharika Senanayake, Director-Environmental Sustainability, MAS Holdings and Tharuka Dissanaike, Policy and Design Specialist-Environment, UNDP. The discussion was moderated by Feizal Samath, Consultant-Business Editor, Sunday Times.
Hiran Cooray also added, This forum could not have come at a more opportune time as we in Sri Lanka strive to expand our tourism offering after almost a decade of peace and stability. Imtiaz Muqbils approach was sensible and doable, and it is now up to us to provide the leadership to put Sri Lankan tourism at the forefront of embracing all 17 SDGs and show the world that it can be done.

Spark of innovation
Changing the innovation landscape for the betterment of Sri Lanka, Royal College took a giant stride when it hosted Spark18, the largest innovation and invention exhibition in Sri Lanka from September 25 to 28.
With Sri Lanka ranked a mere 88th in the Global Innovation Index in terms of innovation performance, Royal College saw an opportunity to enhance the countrys innovation capacity by inspiring the younger generation.
With over 700 exhibits on display, the thousands that attended the four day long exhibition would have been awestricken and amazed by the talent of the school children, who have thought out of the box in coming up with ideas, innovations and inventions to solve many day to day problems. Innovations displayed were not limited to those students of Royal College, but also included innovations from children representing schools from across the country, both rural and urban. Spark 2018 was aptly supported by the Sri Lanka Inventors Commission, the apex body to promote innovativeness amongst Sri Lankans, who got onboard the countrys Top 10 inventions at the exhibition as well.
Complementing the innovation of the young children, the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Navy and Sri Lanka Air Forced displayed their innovations as well as research and development initiatives. A key attraction drawing in a large crowd was the Future Pavilion powered by Dialog Axiata, the Principal Sponsors of Spark18, who showcased innovative technologies through their idea mart platform. Inspiring many students to leverage on technology for innovations, Microsoft Sri Lanka conducted a series of seminars for students and teachers during the exhibition.
The exhibition was inaugurated on the first day by Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, Minister of Education alongside Principal Royal College B A Abeyrathna, Project Chairman of Spark18 Rizan Nazeer and Secretary of the School Development Society Asanga Peiris.

Special Unit to tackle issue soon
Highlighting the increase in cases related to the human-elephant conflict (HEC), Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that wild elephants had begun to invade areas that were previously unaffected by the HEC. He said the Wildlife Conservation Department had been informed of the situation.
Elephants had also been breaking electric fences and invading regions where the human-elephant conflict was previously prevented, Wanninayake said, and added that several Wildlife officials and farmer organisation representatives involved in agricultural and agrarian development projects had told the District Agriculture Committee that electric fences were restricting the natural habitat of elephants. They had said that the fences were only aggravating the elephants.
Wanninayake said that he had instructed Wildlife officials to remove any unauthorised constructions that would worsen the issue, as well as to prevent illicit activities in forest reserves.
He said that he had requested the Assistant District Wildlife Conservation Director to form a special unit comprised of Wildlife and Civil Security officials in order to combat the human-elephant conflict.
Dr. Pruthiviraj Fernando, Chairman of the Conservation Research Centre; a non-governmental organisation focusing on issues related to the HEC; said that the efforts of Wildlife officials had been futile for the past 75 years.
He said that elephant cows and calves were easier to drive away than the males and added that according to the research conducted at the centre, around 70 percent of wild elephants were living outside of forest reservations.
Driving away elephants with firearms and crackers was not an efficient long-term strategy, Fernando said.

Sri Lanka seeks Indian help to tackle match-fixing
Colombo, Monday: India has offered to assist Sri Lanka with its inquiry into match-fixing in cricket and drafting laws to combat cheating in the game, a Sri Lankan cabinet minister said Monday.
Sri Lankas Petroleum Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said Indias Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) could provide technical expertise in probing widespread allegations of corruption in cricket.
I made the request, and Prime Minister Modi immediately put me in touch with the CBI, said Ranatunga, who also skippered Sri Lanka during their World Cup victory in 1996.
We dont have the expertise or the laws to deal with this problem in a proper manner. India promised to help us in drafting legislation too, the minister said after returning from New Delhi.
The CBI named Ranatunga and his deputy Aravinda de Silva in a match-fixing investigation in 2000 but the pair were cleared of any wrongdoing. Sri Lanka promised to establish a special police unit to investigate match-fixing after a documentary aired in May alleged massive global corruption in cricket.
Galle groundsman Tharanga Indika and professional cricketer Tharindu Mendis allegedly speculated about fixing the pitch to ensure a result in under four days in the Test against England.
Both men have been suspended by Sri Lanka Cricket pending an ICC investigation. A third man, provincial coach Jeevantha Kulatunga, was also suspended.
Sanath Jayasuriya, a member of the 1996 World Cup winning squad, is under investigation by the International Cricket Councils anti-corruption unit, along with several others. Jayasuriya has been charged for not cooperating with a match-fixing probe and concealing information. AFP

STF to boost security at Colombo prisons
Police Special Task Force (STF) personnel will be deployed outside Colombo prisons too shortly to prevent drugs and other illegal material from reaching prison inmates, a spokesman for the Justice and Prisons Reforms Ministry said.
The Ministry earlier said the STF would be deployed to inspect visitors at all the main prisons.
STF officers will be deployed at the three main prisons in Colombo shortly, the spokesman said.
Meanwhile, a protest staged by a group of prisoners at the Angunakolapelessa Prison against the deployment of STF personnel ended yesterday.
Nearly 100 prisoners had climbed a tower at the prison premises and protested on Sunday against the deployment of the STF. The protest ended yesterday following talks with prison authorities
The Ministry spokesman said the decision to deploy STF personnel for additional security at prisons will not be changed.

Sujeewa calls for commission to probe corruption charges
State International Trade Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe called for a commission to be set up to investigate the alleged corruption charges behind the High-Speed Electric Train Production Plant project.
Speaking at a media briefing yesterday at his Ministry in the World Trade Centre, Colombo, to promote his foundation Simply Women, the minister stressed that action needed to be taken against those who have levelled such charges against him to cause serious damage to his reputation.
Earlier this month, a businessman alleged that the State Minister and International Trade and Development Strategies Minister Malik Samarawickrama had solicited a bribe worth 10 percent of the project to grant approval for the project.
Senasinghe later denied the charges and said that the US$ 500 million investment company was not a legitimate BOI registered company and the businessman, Anton Deshapriya was a conman who had defaulted on many loans.
Former Minister Felix Dias Perera also called me and when I told him about this, he said that Deshapriya had even cheated him of Rs. 5 million. At the time, he had promised to supply him imported sausages for his business, and then he fled the country with the money after a police complaint was made, said Senasinghe who had informed the police of this development.
He however lamented the slow progress made by the police with regard to the investigations. The State Minister had complained to the police 13 months ago that he received death threats from this person and he had another threatening call last week after his press conference on the matter.
I had made a complaint to the police about my first call, but I have learnt that investigations into it were dropped after a while. This man is known to be a Pohottuwa supporter and threatened me saying that I was responsible for bringing down Mahinda Rajapaksa.
This is not just an attack against me, but an attack against the UNP. I will make a statement in Parliament asking the Prime Minister and the Law and Order Minister to quicken the pace of investigations, he added, as he urged the party and government to take a more united stand against such campaigns.

Super Sun SC holds New Youngs FC to a draw
Super Sun SC recovered after trailing 0-1 to a force a draw against New Youngs FC 1-1 in the Dialog Champions League curtain raiser played at Alfred Duraiappah Stadium, Jaffna on Sunday.
B.S. Nimo headed into a 22nd minute lead in for New Youngs FC and O. Daniel scored a goal in 78th minute, equalising before the half time for Super Sun SC. Early in the first half it was New Youngs who looked the dominant team with few of the national poolists among their ranks, including Duckson Piuslas  skipper for the Wennappuwa side.
Super Sun goalkeeper Janaka Kosala was put under immense pressure and looked shaky between the posts.
New Youngs capitalizing on this struck first with a long kick into the Super Sun box which was misjudged by Kosala and B.S. Nimo chipped it over him to score the first goal of the league.
The poor ground conditions affected the players as none of the players were able to play fluently as the ball kept wobbling all over the field.
The second half was somewhat subdued from start as both teams struggled.
The pace of the game was pedestrian for the most part of the second half. New Youngs FCs Mohamed Fawzan and Oluwatosin Daniel of Super Sun SC were shown yellow cards during the game.

Term of NPC ends tomorrow
The term of the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) ends tomorrow (24) and the administration will be vested with Northern Province Governor Reginold Cooray until the elections are held. Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri told the Daily News that the term of the North Western and Central Provinces too lapsed this month.
The elections to the above provinces were conducted on September 21, 2013.
With the addition of the above three provinces, elections are due for six PCs. The last PC elections were held under four stages in 2012, 2013 and 2014.
The term of the Eastern, North Central and Sabaragamuwa provinces, for which the elections were held on September 8, 2012, lapsed last year. The term of the Southern and Western PCs continues till April next year and the term of the Uva Provincal Council will continue till September next year.
Political parties have still been unable to reach an agreement on the electoral system to be adopted in the upcoming PC elections. The SLFP recently reiterated its position that the elections must be held under the new electoral system, a hybrid of the First-Past-the-Post and the Proportional Representation, whereas the UNP is strongly in favour of reverting to the old electoral system until the loopholes of the new system are rectified.

Mirigama Base Hospital is being developed at a cost of Rs. 700 million, with funding from the Chinese government. Thirteen more state hospitals will be developed with the assistance of the Chinese government, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was speaking at the opening of a new unit constructed at a cost of Rs. 80 million at the Mirigama Base Hospital.
Peoples health is much more important than granting relief to manufacturers of sweetened drinks. These manufacturers asked for relief, but no relief can be given to them because people fall ill after drinking sweetened drinks and the government needs to spend large sums of money to treat them, he said.
Minister Senaratne said manufacturers should think about the people and ensure they deliver a service while doing business. People get 100 percent free health service because of the yahapalana government.

Uber, Pick Me drivers protest
Taxi drivers driving for app-based ride hailing firms of Uber and Pick Me yesterday staged a protest outside the office of Uber in Colombo against unfair commission rates charged by the companies.
Drivers holding placards protested before the Uber office in Colombo 7. A Facebook group called Uber drivers/partners Sri Lanka had organized the protest with posts alleging that the company exploited the drivers with their 25 percent commissions.
We are against this app mafia. They are bleeding the drivers dry. We ask the government to step in to protect taxi drivers and regulate these companies, said one post.
The protesters also complained that increasing fuel prices and various promotions run by Uber to compete with others taxi hailing services have cut into the drivers profits but Uber has offered no reprieve.
The protest which grew in size, called for all Pick Me and Uber drivers to stop working yesterday and one Uber driver who was seen to be working was seen to be harassed by the crowd. An Uber representative speaking to Daily News in the meantime said, We regret the disruption caused to our rider and driver-partner community, due to a small group of individuals. We remain committed to serving the city and ensuring that our driver partners continue to access a stable income, while giving riders a convenient, reliable option to get around Colombo.
A representative of Pick Me in the meantime said the protest was fake news, they only charged 10 percent in commissions and that they would be speaking to the drivers with regard to their issues.
Uber has had protests launched against it around the world in the last few years from Greece to London with taxi drivers in unison calling out the company for unfair competition, unfair commission rates and lack of safety.
This year alone taxi drivers in Australia, Spain, Greece and Brussels shut off their apps in protest against the companys unfair employment practices.

Welgamas remarks detrimental to JO - Gammanpila
The remarks made by UPFA MP Kumara Welgama on his opposition to the possible Presidential candidacy of ex-Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa are unfounded and detrimental to the progress of the Joint Opposition (JO), Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) leader MP Udaya Gammanpila said yesterday.
Joint Opposition MP Kumara Welgama recently said there was no point in talking about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election as he was a US citizen and therefore ineligible to contest.
Addressing a news briefing in Colombo, Gammanpila said Welgamas comments can create a rift within the JO.
Gammanpila said that Welgama had been advised not to make such disparaging remarks on several occasions. Welgama worked hard for the uplift of the JO. This is why we did not comment on his remarks. But, if he continues in this manner, irrespective of what he has done for the party, we have to take action, he added.
Kalutara district MP Welgama during a public event recently said former President Rajapaksa should not talk about fielding a member of his own family as the next Presidential hopeful.
He said family bandyism is not suitable for the country and former President Rajapaksa faced defeat at the last Presidential election due to this family centred rule.

2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development:
Where are we now
World Development Information Day falls tomorrow. The UN General Assembly in 1972 established this day to draw the world attention to development problems and the need to strengthen international cooperation to solve them. The Assembly also decided that the date for the event should coincide with United Nations Day.
The UN Assembly believes that improving the dissemination of information and the mobilization of public opinion, particularly among young people, would lead to greater awareness of the development problems.
United Nations Organisation from its inception in 1945, has been focussing mainly on improving all inhabitants well-being. For example, two and half decades ago, nearly 40 per cent of developing worlds population existed in extreme poverty. Since then, the world has halved extreme poverty, with the UNs Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) greatly contributing to this progress.
Recognizing the success of the MDGs, and the need to complete the job of eradicating poverty, in September 2015, the UN adopted an ambitious 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development.
MDGs helped end or minimise poverty for some, but not for all. The UNs new Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are expected to complete the work begun with the MDGs.
The SDGs
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development predicts a safe and secure world which is, amongst others, free of poverty and hunger, with full and productive employment, access to quality education and universal health coverage, the achievement of gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls, and an end to environmental degradation.
Energy is also at the heart of many of these SDGs  from expanding access to electricity, to improving clean cooking fuels, from reducing wasteful energy subsidies to curbing deadly air pollution that each year prematurely kills millions around the world. One of these goals  commonly known as SDG 7  aims to ensure access to affordable, reliable, sustainable and modern energy for all by the end of the next decade.
The Sustainable Development Agenda is a universal framework of action integrating social, economic and environmental factors of sustainable development, peace and governance. The Agenda also includes an overriding principle of ensuring that no one is left behind in the achievement of the SDGs.
Sri Lankan experience
The Government of Sri Lanka also has embraced the universality of the 2030 Agenda and is committed to supporting its implementation in Sri Lanka. Most of the Governments policies and programmes, both domestically and internationally, are currently aligned with the 2030 Agenda.
However, for a country like Sri Lanka, where noticeable social and regional disparity exists, an inclusive approach is needed for the implementation of the SDGs. The national programme should ensure that all marginalized and excluded groups are stakeholders in development processes so that no sector is left behind. This is particularly applicable to those groups who are marginalized or otherwise vulnerable, which include rural people, women, youth and children, people with disabilities.
Sri Lanka has been an on track with regard in realising many MDGs and even had met some of them well ahead of the scheduled dates. Those relate to poverty, education, and certain areas in health.
World Bank Report issued in April this year confirms: Sri Lanka has made significant progress in its socio-economic and human development indicators. Social indicators rank among the highest in South Asia and compare favourably with those in middle-income countries. Economic growth has translated into shared prosperity with the national poverty headcount ratio declining from 15.3 percent in 2006/07 to 4.1 percent in 2016. Extreme poverty is rare and concentrated in some geographical pockets.
The countrys unemployment rate stands below 5%. Free education and health policies have resulted in high life expectancy (75 years) and high youth literacy (98.7%) rates. UN has recognized Sri Lanka among high human development achieved countries.
Policy
The Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs with the support of Department of Census and Statistics has already prepared a comprehensive report titled Status of Sustainable Development Goals Indicators in Sri Lanka, updated December 2017. It includes a holistic policy framework on the implementation of the SDG Agenda 2030. It has taken evidence-based policy research to identify economic, social and environmental priorities of the county.
Extensive consultation with relevant government agencies, civil society and the business sector and the relevant international organisations have been done before preparing the report.
The Government has also formulated key plans and strategies for implementation of SDGs. For example, the National Budget 2018 focuses on a Blue Green Economy envisaged to create an eco-friendly environment where all can co-exist harmoniously. The governments Vision 2025 provides the overall vision and the Public Investment Programme, the three-year rolling plan align significantly with SDGs.
Means of implementation
As a step towards improving the institutional coherence in implementing the SDGs, in October 2017 Sri Lanka enacted the Sustainable Development Act No. 19 of 2017. The Act provides for the establishment of a Sustainable Development Council as the national coordinating body for implementing the SDGs. The Council is already appointed by the President.
There are a number of challenges encountered in meeting this target.
Poverty
Although country-wise poverty rate has dropped, yet due to the regional disparity in achievements of targets, gaps are detected in some districts. Moneragala and Mullaitivu are two examples, where the poverty stands around 15 to 20 %. Therefore, both efficiency and coverage of the existing social protection programmes need to be improved to support the poor and vulnerable.
Health
Sri Lanka can be happy about improvement in most sectors in health, particularly, maternal mortality, under-five mortality and neonatal mortality which have reduced remarkably. However, population aging and increasing non-communicable diseases are challenges. The Government Health Policy has addressed these issues but more dynamic actions need to be taken.
Education
While Sri Lanka has achieved successes in many areas of education, yet challenges remain. Some areas are: improving the quality and relevance of education, increasing access to modern higher and vocational education, standardizing non-state education and strengthening linkage between general and vocational education.
Gender equality
One segment where Sri Lankas weak rating reflects is in gender equality. The country ranks 73rd out of 188. Although womens share in local authorities has been increased through legislation, on other political representations, gender inequalities are particularly observed.
Water and sanitation
Around 90% of the population has access to safe drinking water. However, disparities exist regionally and issues exist on quality and quantity of drinking water. Eighty seven percent of the population possesses onsite sanitation facilities. Providing facilities to the rest and managing wastewater in urban centres and industrialized areas remain challenges.
Transport
Public transport accounts for 57% of passengers. Transport has number of challenges. Measures such as railway electrification, Light Rail Transit System and fuel-efficient vehicles need to be introduced to modernize transport. Consideration must be given and solutions found for the traffic congestion in urban areas, increasing private vehicle usage and increasing road accidents are challenges.
Tourism
Sri Lanka has tremendous potential for tourism with its geographical location and the many diverse attractions within a relatively small area. Annual tourist arrivals have increased five-fold during the last ten years. The potential is very much more. A transformation in the tourism strategy is urgently needed for its development and sustainability.
Natural resources
Sri Lanka is one of the worlds 35 biodiversity hotspots. High level of endemicity is observed in most taxonomic groups. However, a considerable number of species are threatened species. Meanwhile, deforestation has become a challenge due to increased demand for land. Solutions need to be identified and start a long-term National Biodiversity Strategic Action Plan.
As World Bank says in their report, For Sri Lanka, the political uncertainty is the key risk to an otherwise favourable medium-term outlook. External risks include lower growth in key countries that generate foreign exchange inflows to Sri Lanka. Steeper than expected global financial conditions would increase the cost of debt.On political level, these challenges too, must be taken into account.

Whopper fish tales of the ones that got away
Wherever anglers gather, we hear the stories all the time of the one that got away. And of how incredibly big the fish was. Do anglers lie Most people seem to think so. Certainly, it is true that there are some fishermen and women who lie about the size of the fish that got away. But for the most part, anglers just exaggerate a little, or a lot, in the excitement of the moment.
I know this from my own experience. I do not profess to be in the same expert angling class as my cousins Arlen, Bambi or Vilma who are all reel aces and can tackle any denizen of the deep. They are all in the big game fishing league and are hailed as first-class anglers by any standards. To me, any kind of fishing is an exciting sport. When you become hooked on it, even a bad day of fishing is still better than a good day at the office! To many, fishing is not a sport - its a way of life.
But every so often, whenever a fish I had hooked breaks the surface of the water, I can swear blind that its the biggest fish I had ever seen. Then later, when I land it, I realize that it was nothing, but a feisty fighting little fingerling. Now imagine this! If that same fish had made a break for it I would be telling a real whopper about the monster that high-tailed it, leaving me high and dry. That is because the fastest growing fish on earth is the one that got away. It is natural for your imagination to enhance what could have been and then its easy to pass that information on to others.
People are known to embellish the size or quantity of their catch when looking back. So dont blame the anglers because they simply cant help it. Actually, the size of the fish hardly matters once you hook it. Whether it is a monstrous barracuda or a fighting little Paraw on your line there will always be the guaranteed adrenaline rush. Your heart is still beating hard and the euphoria hits a frenzied high from hooking and retrieving the fish. In the excitement of the moment, some anglers eyes magnify the fish from 100 percent to 200 percent.
It simply happens sometimes and you dont realize it. I was once being honest about the numbers and size of the catch telling my audience that the Kattawa shoal measured about 12 inches each. There was giggling all round when one of the women listening queried: If they were 12 inches long why are your hands two feet apart So you see I dont exaggerate...I just remember big!
A long time ago there was a raging debate at The Fishtails, which used to be my regular watering-hole. The Fishtails was actually a swimming club built on a natural rock foundation in a secluded cove beside the seaside. A good many of the former Devils of Saint Bens used to patronize the breezy place.
It was a splendid, scenic venue for anyone wanting to relax and wet their whistle with a cheerful tipple. The debate was triggered by a former classmate Desi who was baiting another old batch-mate nicknamed Jambu. There had never been any love lost between Desi and Jambu since they had been in rompers in Baby Class together. The fact that Desi was a lousy fisherman and Jambu a keen and successful angler hardly helped bridge the rift.
Jambu had walked into the clubhouse with a string of fresh fish he had caught at the adjacent Fisheries Harbour. He handed them over to the clubhouse kitchen with instructions to batter-fry half the catch as a treat for the gang and keep the rest for themselves. Just as he retreated to the shower stalls to wash up Desi dashed into the club foyer and began scribbling on the white board with a black marker pen. He adeptly inscribed this legend on the board in enormous letters: A fisherman is a jerk on one end of the line waiting for a jerk on the other end.
Jambu glanced at the board, ignored the taunt and joined the gang.
As he ordered a round of drinks another old Ben, Boyd, playing Devils Advocate informed him that the discussion underway centered around the reputation of fishermen as being notorious liars. Looking decidedly uncomfortable Jambu eased back in his chair and looked around for a sympathetic face among the baiting crew. There wasnt a single one in sight. Boyd continued: Desi here has posed the question of whether all fishermen are liars or do all liars fish
The biggest wag of them all Sir Chepps interjected: Its not that all fishermen are liars or that only liars fish. The problem lies with the uncanny ability of the fish to keep growing after it is caught! But Desi seemed remorseless with his baiting of his poor angling contemporary: No, I tell you, fishermen are actually incapable of telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help them cod. I repeat, so help them cod. Its in their genes. And I dont mean their fishy smelling denims either, although that could be the case as well in the present circumstances. He then moved his chair away from Jambu and fired a below-the-belt shot: Old Fisherman never die, they just smell that way!
Desi waved to an acquaintance at the bar and yelled: Tall fish tales, being told at Fishtails! Just then the waiter arrived with sizzling hot platters of Jambus fried fish. Jambu seeming to have regained his composure shot back: If wishes were fishes, wed have fish fry. Sir Chepps while spearing a fork into the tempting dish said: Thank you JambuGood things come to those who bait!
Jambu stood up and disappeared into the staff quarters of the club. He emerged soon enough holding two fishing rods, his own and Desis, and a two pound fish from his catch. He threw the slimy creature at Desi who tried to hold on to it as it fell into his lap. He shot back at Desi: The only way you will ever catch a fish is if someone throws it at you. So there!
He then flaunted his professional fiberglass rod publicly announcing it was his, and then placed Desis much shorter one alongside it.
Jambu then yelled for another round of drinks as he delivered his devastating coup de grace: You can separate the men from the boys by comparing the size of their rods!

Rangana Herath to have last hurrah at Galle
Wonky knees forces spin legend to quit Test cricket
Sri Lankas spin legend Rangana Herath who has announced that he will retire from Test cricket at the end of the first Test against England at Galle next month said that he took the decision because of the game having a heavy toll on his wonky knees.
The main reason is I am having a bit of an injury with my knees and I am not sure how far I can go. In the last one and a half years I havent played consecutively in three Tests matches I am not sure whether I can continue, Herath told the Daily News.
In that case it is not fair for me to rest between Tests and play in Colombo. At the same time whoever takes my place will get the best opportunity for at least he will get two Tests to continue. Those are the reasons for my retiring after the first Test, he said.
Herath has for the past six years or so been bravely carrying on the burden of his countrys fortunes as their match-winning bowler despite being handicapped by his two knees having undergone surgery.
I had some injections on my knees a painful one where you replace the old blood and inject new blood and also this pain relief injections. At 40 plus its not easy to play three Tests consecutively, explained Herath.
I wont get these pains regularly but once a year or twice a year. Just before the 2015 World Cup I had an injection. After that I never had an injection but I underwent surgery in both knees - arthroscopy where I had broken cartilage taken out that was just after the 2011 World Cup. I think this is the right decision at the right time, he said.
100 TEST WICKETS AT GALLE
Herath said there was nothing special attached to quitting Test cricket at Galle except that he is one wicket away from taking 100 Test wickets at this venue.
I am close to taking 100 wickets at Galle. It is where I started my Test career so it would be quite appropriate to end it there. I am always looking for a win. It would be a nice way to sign off with 100 wickets and a win.
Only Muthiah Muralitharan has taken more wickets at this venue with 111 wickets (avg. 18.50) from 15 Tests. Herath who has played most part of his career in the shadow of the great bowler has 99 wickets (avg. 24.31) from 18 Tests.
In October last year Herath became the first left-arm spinner to take 400 Test wickets when he bowled Sri Lanka to a 21-run victory over Pakistan at Abu Dhabi.
Heraths current tally stands at 430 wickets (avg. 27.95) from 92 Tests.
Sri Lanka team member wicket-keeper/batsman Niroshan Dickwella said: He is a legend. I am proud to have kept wickets to him and played under him. He had a brief stint as captain as well. It is a great achievement to have taken over 400 Test wickets. He is also the number one bowler in the world.
I am not surprised to be frank given his age and the amount of things that he had done for Sri Lankan cricket. When it is the right time you have to go and I guess he has made the right decision. We are happy for him. We do have some left-arm spinners in our ranks and they are training with the spin squad. There will be good youngsters coming up.
SPINNERS WAITING ON THE WINGS
Herath was of the view that Sri Lanka wont be starved of quality spinners after his departure.
There are a few guys waiting on the wings like Dilruwan (Perera) and Akila (Dananjaya) who are already playing. Then there is Malinda Pushpakumara, Lakshan Sandakan and Jeffrey Vandersay. The back-up plan is good. They need a bit more time to get settled and the confidence while playing, then they will learn and will deliver their best, said Herath.
Just take my career the first 10 years although I played some Tests I was not consistent I was struggling even performance wise. But if you take my last 20 years you can see consistency, he said.
Herath made his Test debut against Australia in 1999 and did not get a permanent place in the team until 2009 after Muralitharan retired. In his initial 10 years he played in only14 Tests and captured 35 wickets, but after 2009 he reeled off 395 wickets from 78 Tests averaging five wickets a Test. Herath has already retired from one-day cricket after the 2016 World Twenty 20.
The legendary left-armer is happy the way the Test side is performing and said, We are not in the top three but we have been doing well that means we are playing with confidence. I am sure even without me they will continue the good work.
Future plans Nothing special I work for a bank (Sampath Bank) and I need to go back and give something back to them.

No licences to import crops grown in SL
The Agriculture Ministry has decided not to issue licences for the importation of certain crops that can be grown in the country next year.
During a meeting held with cereal importers at the ministry recently, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera informed the importers that he would not allow them to import food crops such as maize, undu, soya, green gram, sesame, finger millet, and groundnuts that could be easily cultivated in the country.
The minister invited them to assist farmers to cultivate these food crops in the country and he also pledged to provide lands if it is necessary.
Sri Lanka is still importing those crops from India, Bangladesh and Pakistan, and around 40,000 MT of groundnut, 164,000 MT of maize, 8000 MT of undu was imported to the country last year, at a cost of Rs.8,336 million.
The government annually spends Rs. 118 billion for the importation of lentils, undu, green gram, chickpea, dry chilies, sugar, potatoes, big onion, coriander, ginger, turmeric, and plums, the majority of which can be produced locally.

Galle Dialogue 2018
Regional cooperation a must for Indian Ocean stability
President Maithriapla Sirisena receives a special memento presented by Navy Commander Vice Admiral Sirimewan Ranasinghe after he inaugurated the Galle Dialogue 2018 International Maritime Conference in Colombo yesterday morning. The two-day conference on the theme Synergizing for Collaborative Maritime Management jointly organised by the Defence Ministry and the Sri Lanka Navy for the ninth time and attended by delegates of 50 countries and 17 international organisations concludes today (October 23). Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, Deputy Minister of Defence Ruwan Wijewardana, Defence Ministry Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, Chief of Defence Staff and the three Service Chiefs wee among those present.

The Indian Ocean today is emerging as a hub of global economic activity. The third-largest water body of the world with rim nations of 2.7 billion people has experienced maritime threats caused by piracy, narcotics and human smuggling, terrorism, waste dumping and IUU fishing over the past few decades, said Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, PC.
Speaking at the Galle Dialogue 2018 under the theme Synergizing for collaborative maritime management yesterday, he said protecting maritime resources, countering the diverse challenges and ensuring uninterrupted global trade is not an easy task by any means. Therefore, securing the sea lines of communication passing Sri Lanka has become a priority in the global maritime domain.
The Galle Dialogue 2018 affords a forum for regional and extra-regional players to speak on their maritime vision and management plan, discuss the challenges, and better understand each other. It is against such a background, with renewed focus on Indian Ocean affairs, that the ninth meeting of the Galle Dialogue International Maritime Conference continues on its legacy of connecting the East and the West.
The opportunities and challenges that exist in the maritime domain need to be addressed with strength, wisdom and benevolence. Therefore, it is imperative that maritime affairs, concerns and issues are managed in a collaborative framework in a comprehensive manner, he said.
Waidyaratne noted that international maritime conferences like the Galle Dialogue, therefore, can play a vital role in providing a platform for much-needed discussions and ensure that stakeholders have equal access to shared domains.
Due to Sri Lankas geo-strategic position and easy access to the Indian Ocean, its role to secure and promote a peaceful environment in the Indian Ocean is clear to the entire world. But, he said, there are many challenges and threats we face.
These challenges could only be mitigated through regional and extra-regional collaborative measures while expanding the information network and thereby reinforcing the capacity to contain maritime challenges to an appreciable level.
The Galle Dialogue International Maritime Conference since its inception has become an important platform for improving mutual trust, reaching consensus, and strengthening cooperation for navies and other stakeholders from regional and trans-regional countries.
We must seek cooperation and assistance from all nations to ensure that the Indian Ocean is free from all threats and challenges.
It is the responsibility of all of us as neighbours within the Indian Ocean to take easy steps at our command to ensure safe navigation in the waters within our region, the Defence Secretary said.

Sri Lanka needs to attract  high spending tourists
One of the key problems repeatedly highlighted by the Travel industry is the lack of accurate data and this is an issue that has to be addressed soon.
This issue was highlighted at the Tourism Leaders Conference titled Integration of Global Value Chains for Sustainable Tourism Development: Way Forward for Sri Lanka Tourism. The event was organized jointly by Sri Lanka Tourism and the University of Colombo at BMICH.
It was pointed out that for years, the Government has been releasing numbers that do not differentiate between the formal and informal sectors adequately to understand how many foreigners are tourists, where they stay, how much they spend, and their level of expectations. Without in-depth data, policymakers cannot understand the direction the industry should take, which affects the entire value chain, speakers at Forum said.
It was pointed out by speakers that when compared to its neighbours, Sri Lanka boasts a most enviable variety in sights and attraction. Wildlife safaris, exotic marine life, beautiful sandy beaches, cozy cold climate escapes, deep sea diving, ancient ruins. Yet Sri Lankas promotion abroad is very limited when compared to the work that countries with far less to offer put in. Furthermore, the protection of its natural resources has been woefully inadequate.
Meanwhile Chairman Ranjit Fernando, SriLankan Airlines said that Sri Lanka tourism and the national carrier should jointly promote the destination.
Dinesh Weerakody, Chairman, ICCSL moderated the session other panel members were Gary Dolski, Managing Director / CEO, Metro Jets / Jet Aviatio, Prof. Sanjaya Nadkarni, Director Innovation and Research, Emirates Academy of Hospitality Management. Lars Eltvik, Group Managing Director, Dusit Thani/ Dusit Education - Thailand, Harald Zulauf,CEO, Media Consulta International Holding A.G, Ranjit Fernando, Chairman, SriLankan Airlines, Ajai Vir Singh, Founding member of the Commonwealth fashion council, Immigration Controller, Nihal Ranasinghe and Alston Koch.

The names of traitors who try to destroy the unity of this government will soon be revealed, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
Minister Senaratne said the President and Prime Minister should keep their promises made to the people on January 8, 2015 when establishing this good governance government.
He was addressing the gathering after opening the `Seva Piyasa' at Horampella in Minuwangoda, recently.
Minister Senaratne said he always stood for good governance.
Two good individuals were appointed as leaders of the country in 2015. But certain sections are trying to interfere with their decisions. Some did not know about the 2015 revolution and joined the government after the revolution, he said.
There are some who use politics to earn money. Some work to establish their names. People should take a decision about them. Some are trying to destroy the good governance. While one person goes to prison for keeping a gun, another gets bail after keeping 3,000 guns. This situation should change. Law should be implemented against all culprits, he added.

Commission probing SriLankan Airlines
Treasury had not appointed any representative to SriLankan Board
The General Treasury, being the main shareholder had not appointed any representative to the Board of Directors of SriLankan Airlines from 2009 to 2017, Secretary to the Treasury Dr.R.H.S.Samaratunge confirmed yesterday.
Testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry into SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka Pvt. Ltd., Dr.Samaratunge said that it was only in 2018 that the Treasury had appointed two of its representatives to SriLankan Airlines Board of Directors after the government took over the management of the airline from the Emirates in 2008, during the previous regime.
According to him, Mano Tittawella, Senior Adviser to the Minister of Finance and former Director General of State Accounts Department Senaratne have been appointed as the representatives to the SriLankan Airlines Board of Directors a few months ago.
However, Article 79 of the Articles of Association of SriLankan Airlines indicates that the Board of Directors of the airline should comprise not less than five and not more than nine members, whereas six of them, including the Chairman are appointed by the government. Act No.15 of 2010 has made legal provisions for the Secretary to the Treasury to nominate a person to be his representative in the Committee, Authority, Board or Institution, where the Secretary to the Treasury have provisions to be a member by the legislation. This representative should be nominated either from the Ministry of Finance or any Department of the General Treasury,the Act indicates.
When asked by the Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe as to who makes the nominations to the Board, he said that currently, the line ministry has the authority to make nominations.
The testimony of the Secretary to the Treasury will continue today on issues including the use of Rs.500 million from the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) for the repurchase of the shares of the SriLankan Airlines belonging to Emirates in 2010.

Unsure about personal tracks on new album
Cheryl is reportedly reconsidering the tone of her new music after her ex Liam Payne decided against sharing personal tracks.
Liam and Cheryl, who share 18-month-old son Bear, split earlier this year after a two-year romance.
Former One Direction star Liam, 25, admitted hed tweaked some of his new music to reflect his headspace after the shock split, but has since ditched the idea of releasing the heartfelt songs, leaving Cheryl unsure what to do about her own musical comeback.
Cheryls been eager to maintain an amicable relationship with Liam, but her inner circle say she was also keen to put her side of the break-up across, an insider told Britain's Closer magazine. Especially after Liam admitted he tweaked songs after the split. But his recent admission felt confusing because he seemed to be saying he was in a different stage of life and maybe not wanting to focus on the split anymore.
Cheryl wanted to get things off her chest a bit with the lyrics on her new album and she has found recording a therapeutic process. But with Liam hinting that he wont be getting personal on his material, its blind-sided Cheryl a bit. The 35-year-old hasnt released an album since 2014s Only Human, but said in July that her fifth record is pretty much finished.
Producer Naughty Boy and her Girls Aloud bandmate Nicola Roberts were among her collaborators, but the source says Cheryl now doesnt know what to do about the tracks detailing her split.
Critics are always ready to pore over everything she puts out and it wouldnt be good for her if she ended up looking as if she was the one who couldnt move on from everything between them, while Liam seemed over it, the insider said.

New Chief Justice at inauguration
Personal favours are not encouraged in my office
Newly appointed Chief Justice Nalin Perera yesterday told the Supreme Court that personal favours are not encouraged or accommodated in his office as a judge.
Chief Justice Nalin Perera made these remarks while speaking at the ceremonial sitting held at the Supreme Court to welcome him as the countrys 46th Chief Justice.
In my thirty eight year long and challenging journey in the judiciary I have constantly sensed the tension between two ends that any conscientious judge will need to strike a balance.
One end being the need to humbly integrate with society as a real man with real sorrows and weaknesses; and the other being the need to keep my arms-length in such a way that personal favours are not encouraged or accommodated in my office as a judge, the Chief Justice added.
The new Chief Justice was accorded a warm welcome at the ceremonial sitting by an array of Judges of the Supreme Court, Court of Appeal, High Courts, District Courts and the Magistrates Courts.
The Chief Justice further said that his ambition was in the execution of his services towards the plight of the poorest and weakest in society.
My ambition has always been to be diligent in the execution of my services in this field with sensitivity towards the plight of the poorest and weakest in society. The thought of the poor general public being worn out and inconvenienced by a case being unnecessarily postponed has always bothered me. Simple as the thinking might be, it has always stopped me from dragging a case or taking an avoidable leave for my personal matters, even though I may have had the freedom to do so, the Chief Justice further added.
The ceremony began with the speeches from the Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya PC and Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) President U.R. de Silva PC.
The judges of the Supreme Court and Appeal Court, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorala, Ministry officials, former Chief Justice Priyasath Dep, BASL President U.R. de Silva and lawyers attended the event.

A1 is the same old brand new
The title of one of the bands hit songs says it all: Same Old Brand New. Thats what fans of A1 (A One, not to be confused with AI which stands for American Idol) will see when the band stages its 20th Anniversary Reunion Tour twice at the Kia Theater at the SMX Convention Center in Davao City on October 23 and at the Waterfront Hotel & Casino in Cebu on October 25, all produced by Concert Republic.
The concert is called a reunion because more than 15 years after he quit the band, Paul Marazzi has rejoined Ben Adams, Mark Read and Christian Ingebrigtsen. Marazzis leave-taking turned the quartet into a trio.
Formed in 1998, the British-Norwegian pop group achieved instant success with its debut single Be The First To Believe, followed by Like A Rose, Take On Me, Caught In The Middle and its rendition of A-Has Take On Me. These and other songs are expected to be included in the bands reunion repertoire.
Q: Fifteen years is a long time since you first performed in the Philippines. What, if any, do you remember from that visit
Paul: I can remember a lot of very kind people enjoying our music. Oh and the delicious food!
Christian: Wow, its hard to believe it has been 15 years already! I remember a lot of things. How amazing our fans are in the Philippines. How we had to have at least five bodyguards each when walking anywhere. How everyone seems to speak perfect English.
How we performed at the Miss Binibining Pilipinas final at the Araneta Coliseum, and no one had told us that the finalists would parade in their bikinis in front of us during our performance. Ive never played so many mistakes! I remember thinking that the Philippines was one of my absolute favourite places to go to.
Ben: Weve been to the Philippines so many times that its hard to remember the first time but what I can say is that there is a reason we keep coming back! We love it. The people, the food, our fans....so many things!
Mark: It is a long time ago. I remember never having experienced fans like it anywhere else in the world, so passionate and loud, our first introduction to our amazing and loyal fans over there and theyve been a big part of our journey ever since.
Q: How would you make up for that 15-year gap
Paul: I dont feel there is anything to make up for. Although I know that the band members all feel that 15 years is too long.
Christian: Luckily, Mark, Ben and I have had the opportunity to be back to the Philippines a couple of times since then. But this will be the first time well be back as the original line-up, with Paul. I think the main thing well be focusing on this time, is really being present, taking in all the impressions more. Its so easy, when youre in the middle of a whirlwind of success like the one we experienced 15 years ago, to take things for granted and not truly appreciate everything and all the love we get from our fans. This time we will experience everything with a great deal of gratitude, and try to give as much back to our fans as we possibly can.
Ben: Dont understand the question, sorry.
Mark: Well, we have been back many times since, most recently as a three-piece, but this will be an especially momentous occasion and return as it will be all four of us.
Q: Do all of you have families (like most of your fans) Tell us more about your families.
Paul: I have a growing family. I have one daughter...and one on the way!
Christian: I have a wonderful family with a brother, sister, mom and dad. Im a third-generation musician, as my grandfather was a violinist in the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, and my father is a singer, like me. We sometimes do concerts together. He celebrates his 50th anniversary as an artist this year, which we will mark with a great concert in Trondheim in February. My brother sings and plays the piano, but hasnt chosen a career as a musician. My mother is the technical person in the family, and met my dad when she worked as a technician in a recording studio in the 70s. My sister has four wonderful children, and made me an uncle when I was only 10 years old.
Ben: No family for me. Im Peter Pan.
Mark: (No comment)
Q: What did you learn from your breakup and eventual reunion
Paul: That we all had very different versions of events.
Christian: I learned so much about how to stand on my own feet, being a solo artist, having to make all the decisions on my own. But I also learned to appreciate the value of being part of a band, having someone to share all the experiences with, not to mention play ball with, bringing out the best in each other, and how sometimes together we can truly be greater than the sum of each part.
Ben: That there are always two sides to every story and things are always as they seem.
Mark: We have learned to appreciate and respect each other and all that we achieved together and we take more time to enjoy it this time around.
Q: How has your music changed (if it did) during all these years, especially with the emergence of several bands
Paul: My musical preferences have evolved a bit. But I have always tried to be open to everything.
Christian: Well, as people, we always change with the times, growing and evolving. So as a band, weve changed just as our fans have, as weve grown older. But essentially, the chore of whats A1, is that we have four very different people writing the songs, pulling and dragging in each direction, eventually ending up with something that we all can agree is great. As we all grow and change as people and writers, this means what we write will always be colored by the time were in. However, our love for the strong melody will always be at the centre.
Ben: As a band, weve tried out several things but we always feel more comfortable down the caught in the middle type of sound. Just good classic pop/rock.
Mark: Like with all bands, our music changes with the times and styles. But a strong melody and relatable lyrics always remain at the heart of any good song.
