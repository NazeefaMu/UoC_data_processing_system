Economy likely to recover from effects of adverse weather
The Central Bank Monetary Board has noted that the economy is currently operating at a level below its potential.
Nevertheless, as per the available indicators, the economy is likely to recover from the effects of adverse weather conditions in the past two years and benefit from the expected boost in external demand and foreign direct investment inflows.
Improvements in the trade front, including the execution of new trade agreements supported by increased private investment driven by structural reforms, are also likely to provide the necessary impetus for the economy to achieve its potential in the medium term.
On the fiscal front, available indicators suggest that the government has been able to record a marginal surplus in the primary fiscal balance in 2017 after several decades. However, the overall fiscal performance is expected to have deviated from the envisaged path, mainly due to increased expenditure on flood and drought related relief measures and some slippages in revenue collection.
Meanwhile, with the considerable slowdown in food inflation, headline inflation as measured by the year-on-year change in Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) declined sharply in January 2018. It is expected that the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) will also register a substantial decline in January 2018, and both headline and core inflation will stabilise in the desired mid-single digit levels during the remainder of 2018.

EDB, SLGJA to attract new innovative  jewellery design talents
Sri Lanka Export Development Board (EDB) and Sri Lanka Gem and Jewellery Association (SLGJA) in collaboration with Academy of Design (AOD) launched a one year diploma in Jewellery Designing to develop the jewellery designer pool by attracting young and talented designers towards the industry.
The gem and jewellery industry remains one of the countrys main foreign exchange earners and is the 5th largest industry in terms of receiving foreign exchange revenue to the country. The annual foreign exchange generated from jewellery is minimal compared to the exchange generated from gem export during the past few years. At present, Sri Lankas main markets for Jewellery are USA, UAE, Singapore, Hong Kong, Germany, Japan and Switzerland.
The main factors hindering the progress of the industry are the lack of awareness on the benefits of using design as a differentiator in the international market and inadequate number of designers who are capable of producing exquisite designs to attract the high-end segments in the international markets.
The limited local designer pool and the limited capacity of designers to visualize and conceptualize the jewellery designs according to the consumer requirement and produce designs that have a global appeal, has affected the industry in promoting high end jewellery internationally, said Indira Malwatte, Chairperson and Chief Executive, EDB.
The development of design in the industry will help to produce directly to the consumer market especially to the high end and attract more international buyers to Sri Lanka for a higher value-added products, Malwatte added.
Considering the importance of creating appropriate designers for the jewellery industry in order to differentiate Sri Lanka jewellery in the international markets, EDB together with the industry has carried out several jewellery design development programmes to upgrade the capacities and skills of the jewellery designers and to provide exposure locally and internationally, especially advance training using latest state-of-art-technology in jewellery designing.
SLGJA, the key private sector association for the development and promote of gems and jewellery industry also place high priority on developing the skills of jewellery designers in the country.
A long-term approach to teaching design skills is perhaps the most prudent way to address this need. This objective perhaps is best achieved by attracting young people with a fresh mindset and the ability to apply themselves unconventionally, in to the industry, said Sellakumar Kandasamy, Vice Chairman, Jewellery Segment, SLGJA.
It is know that the current pool of designers are technically skilled, but they lack in conceptualization skills.What the industry need is designers with different caliber, who understand the conceptualized contemporary designs for the jewellery industry he further added.
Keeping in line with the above, EDB and the SLGJA undertook another step forward by initiating a Diploma in Jewellery Designing in collaboration with the AOD in order to create appropriate designers for the jewellery industry who could differentiate Sri Lanka jewellery in the international market and to encourage talented young generation to step into the industry with the professional qualifications. Jewellery Design Diploma Programme is a fully-fledged design qualification.
This programme will run for total of 15 months including 3 months compulsory industry internship where the students will be given the opportunity to work in the jewellery manufacturing units in order to gain practical exposure to the industry.
As this is the first endeavor of this nature and given the importance of retaining the designers in the sector, EDB and SLGJA facilitated 5 selected students on the basis of merit and their commitment to work in the jewellery industry for a minimum period of 2 years.
This will benefit the industry to make use of these talented Designers to improve the designs of the jewellery they manufacture.
Continuous implementation of this kind of programmes will broad base the pool of jewellery designers of international caliber in the country, develop the image of Sri Lanka as a country being capable of designing and producing high end luxury jewellery and thereby place Sri Lanka on the world map as major jewellery production centre.

Ethiopia PM Hailemariam Desalegn in surprise resignation

Ethiopian Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn has resigned unexpectedly, saying he hoped to end years of unrest and political upheaval.
In a televised address, he said his resignation was "vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy".
Hailemariam, who has led the country since 2012, also stepped down as chairman of the ruling coalition.
Hundreds of people have died in three years of anti-government protests.
Demonstrations first spread across the country in 2015 amid calls for political and economic reform and an end to state corruption.
Most of the unrest has centred on Ethiopia's two largest regions, Oromia and Amhara.
A 10-month national state of emergency that ended last year failed to stop the protests, as didthe release of thousands of opposition supporters from jail last month.
"Unrest and a political crisis have led to the loss of lives and displacement of many," Hailemariam said.
"I see my resignation as vital in the bid to carry out reforms that would lead to sustainable peace and democracy."
Leaders of the governing coalition - the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) - held an emergency meeting following the announcement, the Addis Standard website reported.
BBC Africa Correspondent Alastair Leithead says Ethiopia's economic growth has been impressive but its steamroller approach to development has sparked years of regional, ethnic-based protest.
The old guard that runs Ethiopia is now afraid its federal, Soviet-style system could collapse, he adds, leaving two possible solutions - to crack down harder on dissent or to try political reform.
Hailemariam said he will stay on as a caretaker prime minister until parliament and the EPRDF accept his resignation and choose a replacement.
Why did Hailemariam resign
Since coming to power, Hailemariam has been seen by the political elite as weak and lacking in leadership.
His resignation could be a move by the coalition to find a stronger leader, or it could signal divisions among the constituent parties along ethnic lines.
Particularly visible is the tension between the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, which has seen its dominance and influence wane, and the Oromo People's Democratic Organisation, which is becoming increasingly more assertive.
Replacing Hailemariam might also be one way to meet the demands of Oromo protesters who have accused the authorities of marginalisation.
Getaneh Balcha, of the opposition Blue Party, said Hailemariam's resignation was "great news for Ethiopians".
"This is the beginning. Other officials also need to follow this and transfer the power to the public," he said.
Hailemariam, a trained engineer, took office following the death of Meles Zenawi who had ruled since 1991.
However, while the former deputy prime minister was a close ally of Meles, he struggled to gain approval of the other EPRDF leaders in order to assume his role.

EU: Unity govt should not lose sight of reforms
EU Ambassador Tung-Lai Margue said he is worried the promised reform agenda could stall with reports that the government might change following the ruling parties poor performance in the recent elections.
The reform agenda: thats the big worry that the international community has got, Margue said in an interview yesterday.
We understand that it has always been a shaky coalition, and obviously recent actions have shown that a lot of people are not happy.
Ambassador Margue said he did not believe peoples widespread support of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna party was a rejection of platforms like reconciliation and anti-corruption.
I dont think it was the reforms as such, but the non-result yet on their daily lives, he said.
I think it was a bit too ambitious to expect that with an ambitious reform agenda, this government could see the fruits so soon.
He said the European Union, which recently reinstated Sri Lankas GSP+ trade benefits, would continue to support an agenda of reconciliation.
We are following the events and we are glad to support the reform agenda, he said.

Evergreen orders eight 11,000  TEU container ships
Evergreen Marine Corp. (EMC) entered into an agreement with Samsung Heavy Industries (SHI) to order eight 11,000 TEU container ships.
The contracts were signed by EMC Chairman Anchor Chang and SHI President & CEO J.O. Nam. Four ships will be owned by EMCs subsidiary, Greencompass Marine S.A. and a further four by Evergreen Marine (Hong Kong) Ltd. The new buildings are planned to be delivered from the first quarter of 2020 through the second quarter of 2021.
Evergreen Marine Corp. emphasizes that the aim of this new building program is to meet future market demand and to continue with its ongoing fleet renewal. On delivery of these new ships, Evergreen will redeliver older chartered vessels as their charter periods expire to help optimize the efficiency of its operating fleet and enhance the competitiveness of its services.
The ship dimensions are 334 meters long, 48.4 meters wide, able to carry 19 rows of containers on deck and has a scantling draft of 15.5 meters. The vessels are designed to sail at a service speed of 23 knots and can pass through the Panama Canal. The ship hulls are shorter than those of ultra large container ships plying the Asia  Europe trade, making it easier to maneuver the ships during berthing or departure and brings greater flexibility in fleet deployment.
The new building design adopts a twin-island concept; separating wheelhouse and accommodation block from engine room and funnel area. The arrangement increases navigation visibility as well as the permissible height of container stacks on deck and therefore the cargo loading capacity.
In line with the stringent eco-friendly criteria that Evergreen has imposed on its own operation, the ships are equipped with various environmental protection devices, including a ballast water treatment system and alternative maritime power to fully comply with the regulations of international maritime agencies and authorities concerned.
Hemas Maritime Pvt Ltd is the local general agent for Evergreen Marine Corp in Sri Lanka.

A Fathers Dream Come True shaped as BCSL

Days were dark with a raging war spreading untold suffering and unbridled poverty in its wake in Sri Lankas East, plaguing the people especially school going children. Parents had no alternative but to send their sons and daughters just after their ALs to work in small grocery shops and wayside garages for a pittance they called a salary.

A door opened and we were greeted by a smart young professional whom I never thought was BCSLs Managing Director. Pen and writing pad on the ready, I was all set to ask questions and take down notes.
Q. Why has this new non state university been located so far away
A. The principle reason is that five out of the six non state universities are situated in Colombo placing a huge burden on students from eastern, northern and north western provinces in finding suitable lodging and bearing transport costs while concentrating on student fees and studies. BCSL is therefore located in the boarder of Batticaloa where connectivity is easy and hassle free for all from these provinces.
The stressful university life may sometimes threaten a students<U+05F3> academic performance. In this sense, design of the campus is far beyond providing a place for study. It should be healing while serving functional as well as mental needs. The beautiful forest surrounding the university campus offers a calm environment conducive to research and reflection while still within a buzzing metropolitan area.
Q. Why has a seat of higher learning as yours structured based on Moghal architecture
A. The Mughal built environment inspires our sense of awe and delight, using elements of design that create artistic harmony, unbound by scale or material.The universal languages of geometry of form and symmetry of patterns, color and textures adds a unity of vision to the architecture that is the majestic Mughal style Pattern is a universal language that is recognizable across cultures and time.Perhaps, however, the greatest impact is how all of the parts fit together so perfectly, making the entire complex much greater than the sum of its parts.

Featherweight battle
Politicians mainly use two weapons to convince people to vote for them. They are the political ideology and the economic prosperity. It seems that the economic prosperity is much stronger than the political ideology. What Sri Lanka may need more is the economic prosperity. Sri Lanka economic prosperity in the 21st century may highly depend on the business relationships country can maintain with the world, particularly with the USA, China and India. Sri Lanka may need fewer politicians and more strategists to achieve its economic prosperity.
It appears world is moving from the European century to the American century to the Asian century. North America, Europe and Japan dominated worlds economy is now shifting towards the east. It may be dominated by the USA, China and India in future.
Highest investors
Importance of a country in the 21st century may depend on its industrial strength (Gross Domestic Product), market (purchasing power), population and land area, education level of the population and the military might. According to the World Bank, the USA recorded the highest Gross Domestic Product (GDP), followed by China in 2016. India remains in the top ten. In terms of purchasing power (GPD Purchasing Power Parity) China leads the table followed by the USA and India.
The USA, China and India together govern a large portion of the world's population and land. World Economic Forum ranked the USA among the top 10 countries based on secondary and tertiary enrollment rates as well as the quality of education in 2016. Although China and India are lagging behind, they may catch up soon. According to Forbes, all three countries are among the highest investors on military in 2016.
Connecting one of the busiest shipping routes in the world, Sri Lankas geographic location links the east and west in the spice routes, also known as maritime silk roads. Sri Lanka desperately needs Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) and exports revenue. Island nation expected to attract US$3 to 4 billion FDI in 2017. It was not so long ago Sri Lanka talked about an ambitious exports revenue target of US$ 50billion by 2020. Sri Lanka may gain its economic prosperity by cooperating with the rest of the world, particularly with the USA and the two rising Asian nations: China and India.
According to the Department of Commerce in Sri Lanka, in 2015 Sri Lankas top five exporting destinations were the USA, the UK, India, Germany and Italy. Sri Lankas top five origins of imports were India, China, Japan, the UAE and Singapore in the same year. But to achieve the expected level of FDI and export revenue, Sri Lanka may need country-specific strategies targeted to increase business in the USA, China and India particularly.
However, the USA, China and India seem to maintain different attitudes and orientations towards international business. In the recent BRICS summit in Xiamen, China, Chinese President Xi Jinping stated we should push for an open world economy, promote trade liberalisation and facilitation, jointly create a new global value chain, and realise a global economic rebalancing. China is walking the talk with its Road and Belt initiative. In contrast, it appears that the USA is becoming a lesser supporter of trade liberalisation. As a result, the USA departed from the Trans-Pacific Partnership Agreement, known as the largest trade agreement in the world. In the meantime, India is taking measures to improve the ease of doing business and liberalise regulations to attract FDI. India is driving its Make in India initiative and was bold enough to take some strong and controversial decisions to support business. Changes in trade policies in the USA, China and India may impact their trading partners.
International business strategy
It is the time to find out Sri Lankas international business strategy in the 21st century. Does the Sri Lankan government have a plan to build more dedicated channels and platforms to attract FDI and take Sri Lankan businesses to the world If Sri Lanka wants economic prosperity, Sri Lankas 21st century leaders need to be strategists who could find a path that balances Sri Lankas national interests, international business and international relations among the complex business orientations and attitudes of the world, particularly the USA, China and India.

First suburban apartment complex registered under Bim Saviya
Suncity Property Developers, a Colombo-based boutique real estate developer, announced recently, that its 13th residential development project-Suncity Tower Moratuwa, designed by Bandusena Associates-had been the first apartment complex to be registered under the national land title registration programme, Bim Saviya.
The announcement reflects a shift from deed to title registrations,allowing landowners to survey, demarcate and ensure land ownership using a centralised digital land information system managed by the Ministry of Lands and Ministry of Public Administration. For a landowner with a deed that is duly lodged in the registry, the expectation is that the law will protect his or her ownership and right to property. But the misuse and abuse of signatures in the form of forgery has become pervasive across Divisional Secretariats island-wide, with the reported number of complaints reaching new highs in recent years.
A robust land registry and document system are vital tools for landowners to protect themselves against real estate fraud, said Pinisiri Fernando, Chairman of Suncity Developers. As a company we have established many firsts in the real estate industry, the greatest achievement being that of pioneering luxury apartments and condominiums in Sri Lanka. I'm grateful to the Hon. Minister of Lands,Hon. Minister of Public Administration, Surveyor General, Registrar General, and to the Condominium Authority for surveying and registering Suncity Tower Moratuwa through Bim Saviya.
Located at Watson Peiris Mawatha Moratuwa (approximately 100 meters from Galle Road), Suncity Tower Moratuwa consists of 20 luxury apartments, each consisting of three bedrooms with spacious sitting, dining, pantry areas adjoined to a separate servants' quarters. Apartment configurations range from 1,300 square feet to 1,426 square feet while common facilities include: 24-hour security, rooftop garden, swimming pool and gymnasium.
Suncity Property has over 21 years of successful business operations in various fields, including testing, inspection, certification, and construction services for the real estate sector. Founded in 1997, the property developer and construction company has an established presence across Sri Lanka.
Today, Suncity is recognised for striving to consolidate its presence in the market.
Its latest project, Prestige Tower Colombo 3, is expected to be completed by the end of March, 2018.

FLORIDA SCHOOL CARNAGE
US: Authorities in Florida could offer no explanation Wednesday night as to why a former student armed with an AR-15 rifle opened fire at a high school earlier that day, killing at least 17 people.
Broward County Sheriff Scott Israel identified the gunman as Nikolas Cruz, 19, a former student at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland who had been expelled for disciplinary reasons, but was currently enrolled in Broward County Public Schools.
Cruz, whose fellow students described him as troubled, was arrested without incident in the nearby town of Coral Springs after the Valentines Day rampage and taken to hospital with minor injuries, the sheriff said.
We have already begun to dissect his websites and things on social media that he was on and some of the things... are very, very disturbing, Israel said.
If a person is predisposed to commit such a horrific event by going to a school and shooting people ... theres not anybody or not a lot law enforcement can do about it. Israel said both students and adults had been killed, 12 of whom have now been identified. He said at least 14 were taken to hospital and two had died there of their wounds. He added one of those killed was a football coach, and one student injured was a deputy sheriffs son.
This is a terrible day for Parkland, Israel said, speaking of the city of about 30,000 people, located 50 miles (80 kilometers) north of Miami.
A teacher at the school said Cruz had been identified previously as a potential threat to his classmates.
We were told last year that he wasnt allowed on campus with a backpack on him, math teacher Jim Gard said in a Miami Herald interview.
There were problems with him last year threatening students, and I guess he was asked to leave campus. Cruz was also said to have been in the Junior ROTC (Reserve Officers Training Corps) program while at school.
A law enforcement source told CBS News that the gunman pulled a fire alarm before opening fire, but Israel could not confirm that report.
The shooting, one of nearly 20 at a school since the start of the year, will once again throw the spotlight on the epidemic of gun violence in the United States, where there are 33,000 gun-related deaths annually.
But when questioned at a press conference late Wednesday, Florida Governor Rick Scott -- who described the massacre as just pure evil -- declined to make a statement on gun control in the aftermath of the shooting.
Theres a time to continue to have these conversations about how through law enforcement, how through mental illness funding that we make sure people are safe, and well continue to do that, said Scott, a Republican.
At the same briefing, Florida Attorney General Pam Bondi said the state will cover the costs of funerals and counseling for survivors.
We will continue to work together as a team, as a family, and love and take care of all of these victims and their family members, she said.
Parkland Mayor Christine Hunschofsky told CNN she had spoken to a number of students after the shooting erupted shortly after 2:00 pm (1900 GMT).
They were very scared, she said. And almost in shock when they came out. Students, some with their hands in the air, were led out of the school by heavily armed police officers and an armored vehicle filled with a SWAT team on the scene.
Student Jeiella Dodoo told CBS News that she and her schoolmates evacuated calmly after hearing what they thought was a routine fire alarm.
The alarm went off so we had to evacuate from our classes, she said. Then we heard gunshots.
I heard about six gunshots, she said, and then some people started running and then everyone started running because we were like If its real, then just run. Teacher Melissa Falkowski told US networks that she had helped 19 students squeeze into a closet with her.
We were in there for probably 40 minutes. We were locked in the closet until SWAT came and got us, she told CNN.
Police officers in helmets, bulletproof vests and armed with automatic weapons could be seen stationed at several points around the sprawling school complex, which serves nearly 3,000 students.
Just a horrible day for us, said the superintendent of the countys school district, Robert Runcie.
This is very sad to me and our family too, 61-year-old Joseph Panikulangara, whose 17-year-old niece Dhiya attends the school, told AFP.
The FBI said it was assisting local law enforcement with the investigation.
When asked about security, Hunschofsky said a police officer is always stationed at the school and there is a single point of entry. -
President Donald Trump offered his prayers and condolences to the families of the victims. No child, teacher or anyone else should ever feel unsafe in an American school, he said on Twitter.
But since January 2013, there have been at least 291 school shootings across the country -- an average of about one a week, according to Everytown for Gun Safety, a non-profit group that advocates for gun control.
It is pretty clear that were failing our kids here, said Falkowski, the teacher who helped shield her students from harm in a closet. - AFP

FTA with Spore makes SL attractive digital hub - Minister
Sri Lankas IT industry has been one of the most remarkable success stories in the countrys economy, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
He was speaking at the IT-BPM Brand Launch at BMICH yesterday to launch the official brand of the Sri Lankan IT-BPM sector  Island of Ingenuity.
The IT industry has emerged and become globally competitive due to the unique talents of our people, the focus on high quality and reliability, but above all  ingenuity and creativity. We need to tell the world about this, and todays brand launch will help us to do exactly that.
The sector has been identified as one of six priority focus sectors, with a focused plan of action that was co-created with industry leaders.
The IT Initiative envisaged in the Budget 2018 and being implemented by the EDB will have complementary programmes to help second tier IT firms break into new global markets through a well-designed and well-governed Champion Builder Programme.
The IT initiative will also support regional IT entrepreneurship and skills availability for the sector. In total, we will be investing 300 million rupees on this over the coming year.
I believe that together with the brand being launched today, these initiatives will drive the IT-BPM export sector to 5 billion dollars in 5 years. Sri Lanka has embarked on a new chapter in its economic development journey, with the ongoing reforms in the macro economy, trade policy, FDI, and the overall business climate. Our ongoing reform efforts have resulted in exports of goods and services growing to 15.15 billion US dollars last year, and an all-time high FDI inflow of 1.63 billion US dollars. We will continue to focus on streamlining investment approvals and facilitation, improving exporter competitiveness, and forging vital bilateral free trade and economic cooperation agreements to become more open and accessible to the world.
He the country has just signed a Free Trade Agreement with Singapore two weeks ago and this is a step towards closer integration with ASEAN and the rest of Asia, making Sri Lanka an attractive digital and logistics hub for this region. There is no doubt that Sri Lanka needs a globally competitive IT industry as a linchpin in transforming our economy.
In this time of flux and of opportunity, Sri Lankas IT-BPM industry can position itself to offer the kind of new and sophisticated digital services that international businesses require.

HC decides to commence trial against Aluthgamage
The Colombo High Court decided to commence trial against former Sports Minister and Kandy District MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage on February 27, in connection with an indictment filed against him by the Attorney General for the alleged criminal breach of trust of Rs. 3.9 million funds belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress, yesterday.
The case was to be taken up for trial yesterday, but Defence Counsel Hafeel Farisz, appearing for the accused, moved court that the case be fixed for a new trial date since his senior counsel, Nalin Ladduwahetty PC, was unable to prepare for the trial. Farisz said the accused had decided to retain Ladduwahetty PC on February 13, just two days prior to the trial date, leaving no sufficient time period to prepare for the trial.
High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne decided to commence trial proceedings since this case had been postponed on several occasions, following the request of the defence.
Senior Counsel Jeewantha Jayatilleke, appearing for the first witness, informed court that his client has arrived from the UK to provide evidence.
Subsequently, Counsel Hafeel Farisz informed court that Presidents Counsel Ladduwahetty had taken a decision not to appear for Aluthgamage on the next date.
The Attorney General alleged that former Sports Minister Aluthgamage has committed a criminal breach of trust with regard to Rs. 1,000,000, misappropriated Rs. 1,900,000, and misappropriated another Rs. 1,000,000 belonging to the Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress between October, 2012 and April, 2013.
The Attorney General charged that the accused had committed punishable offences under section 388 and 389 of the Penal Code, listed 13 persons as witnesses in the case and named eight documents as production items.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General.

Island of brilliance
Juliet Coombe talksto artist Robert Sedgley whose collection of paintingsproduced over two decades will be on exhibition at theLionel Wendt, Colombo from February 19 to 21.
Artist Sedgleys works of architectural brilliance inspires engagement at every level. He has a hugely diverse range of styles and skills and has thus produced many varied paintings on all kinds of subjects that capture the islands historic treasure.
Architecture has been described as frozen music and that is another of its attractions for me. So I conceive my paintings as musical analogies. The whole takes on a symphonic appearance and Sri Lanka is the ultimate score.
Sedgley who loves to sit for days painting a special spot like the Kandy Lake or Galle Fort ramparts attended Junior Art School in Birmingham from the age of twelve to fifteen; and it was his time there, with its intense ethos of creativity and its sense of the camaraderie and the feeling of being part of a brotherhood, that he himself first realised that there was nothing else that he could do but be an artist. Amongst the subjects he studied there was lettering, and it is from this intense study of the forms, proportions and spacing of Roman letters that, he asserts, he derives his sense of design and space in his paintings and sculpture. On leaving school he trained as a silkscreen printer, and later worked as a poster writer, meanwhile attending evening classes in life drawing, portraiture and sculpture.
Then, after some six years working at these trades, on the advice of a friend, he decided to retrain as a teacher. Following a degree level course at Birmingham and Exeter colleges of art, and a postgraduate study at Leicester Polytechnic, he worked in and headed up the Art Departments of several Hertfordshire schools.
A permanent move to a small village in Spain led to a lightening of his pallet and more colour in his landscape work and on discovering Sri Lanka recognised it had the same wonderful features. He and Jean first came to Sri Lanka in 1996. From there they made visits to Galle, Nuwara Eliya, Sigiriya, Dambulla cave temples and the ancient city of Polonnaruwa; making his first studies of this exotic country, charmed by the temples and the astonishing green hillsides of the highland tea estates. On a two day trip to Colombo a chance meeting with the artist S. H. Sarath led to his first exhibition, two years later, in the Artists Studio. A small exhibition of around twenty studies of buildings and temples, which was well reviewed in the papers, and opened by the then British High Commissioner, Linda Duffield, culminated in an interview on a television chat show.
This was followed by an exhibition, From Holy Sites to Humble Dwellings, at the Sri Lankan Institute of Architects in 2001; where he showed a range of pictures, contrasting building styles in Spain, France, Italy, Uganda and Sri Lanka. Inspired by another journey, this time by a train ride from Kandy to the high, mountain town of Haputale, and utilising methods of mark making first developed in his Road and Bridge watercolours, this series of abstracted landscapes extend the techniques of brush and layered colour.
In the next two years he displayed at the renowned Barefoot Gallery in Bambalapitiya, Street level and Trading Places, which was incredibly popular both with the owners and the audience.
It was a conversation with Barbaras son, the photographer Dominic Sansoni, that led to the idea of producing a book, which would be designed as a visual record of a journey around the island, with pencil notes of the artists impressions and experiences, and backed up with a scholarly text on the history and short articles on the most important buildings and sites. The work of many subsequent visits, Travels with a Paint box, took life. In a book which is not only a personal reminiscence of his travels but also a useful travel guide, the artist presents around two hundred new drawings and paintings, with the text by Dr. K. P. Paranavitana, and a foreword by the late Professor Ashley Halp.
Inspired by his interest in Eastern religions, he is currently engaged on a large complex and detailed painting with a modern take, entitled The Age of Kali, a destructive goddess, who carries the seeds of ultimate regeneration, which will usher in a new Golden Age. Many of his works may be viewed on his website: http://www.robertsedgley.com/
ROBERT SEDGLEY
Robert Sedgley is a British artist living in Spain. He paints in oils and water colour and makes ceramic sculpture. He makes regular visits to Sri Lanka, where he is well known for his paintings of buildings and historic sites. He has had seven exhibitions in Sri Lanka.
I have been visiting Sri Lanka since 1998. It is a beautiful country with many temples and varieties of buildings from its colonial past. I am also, in the spirit of portraying the romanic ruin, perhaps, drawn to the many neglected colonial style buildings, defaced by shop signs and air conditioning units, with grass sprouting from the eves which are also part of the townscape, together with rows of ugly newer buildings. In painting these I hope to rescue them from the banal, and the tendency to regard them with horror at the ravages with which time and the unsympathetic accretions of commerce and plumbing have defaced the facades, Sedgley says.

"Normally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly."
"Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another," the statement added.
The magazine Architectural Digest had just publisheda feature about the couple's home in Bel Air, Los Angeles.
In it, Aniston is quoted as saying: "I look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there's nowhere else I want to be."
Theroux was not interviewed for the piece.

Addressing the media yesterday at the JVP Headquarters, the JVP leader said people have divergent expectations for the political parties they support. The implementation of socio-economic policies is the main expectation of voters who support the JVP.
As a political movement, the JVP has to behave responsibly to fulfill the expectations of voters who placed confidence on the policies of the party, he said.
According to the final results of the Local Government Election 2018, the JVP has secured nearly 715,000 votes and around 434 JVP candidates have been elected to the Local Government bodies. The number of JVP members elected to the Local Government bodies had increased by 360 which remained as 74 members earlier.
When we compare it with the results of the General Election, the number of votes received by the JVP had increased by 170,000.
The people of this country should extend their support to create a JVP centered peoples movement because Rajapaksas political movement has no real need to fulfill peoples expectations.

Kusal Mendis helps Sri Lanka thrash Bangladesh in first T20
DHAKA, Thursday: Opener Kusal Mendis scored his maiden half century in Twenty20 internationals to lead Sri Lanka's six-wicket rout of Bangladesh in the first of the two matches in Dhaka on Thursday.
Mendis smashed 53 off 27 balls while Dasun Shanaka hit an unbeaten 42 as the visitors eased past Bangladesh's record total of 193-5 with 20 balls to spare.
Shanaka, who hit 3 fours and 3 sixes in his 24-ball blitz, shared an unbeaten 65-run stand with Thisara Perera to snap Sri Lanka's eight-match losing streak in T20 matches.
Bangladesh rode on brisk half-centuries by Soumya Sarkar and Mushfiqur Rahim to post their highest-ever T20 total but were undone by an attacking opposition batting.
Sri Lanka responded strongly with Mendis putting on 53 runs with fellow-opener Danushka Gunathilaka, who made 30, to put the Bangladesh bowlers on the backfoot.
Left-arm spinner Nazmul Islam, one of the four debutants in Bangladesh line up, broke the stand when he got Gunathilaka stumped.
Nazmul later picked the wicket of Upul Tharanga, for four, before fellow debutant Afif Hossain removed Mendis with his off spin.
But Shanaka and Perera, who was unbeaten on 39 off just 18 balls, ensured no further hiccup in the Sri Lankan innings.
Earlier, the home side surpassed their previous highest score of 190-5 against Ireland at Belfast in 2012, thanks to some prolific batting by Mushfiqur and Soumya.
Mushfiqur remained unbeaten on 66 off 44 balls while Soumya hit a 32-ball 51 -- the left-handed opener's maiden T20 fifty -- after the hosts elected to bat first. Sri Lankan leg-spinner Jeevan Mendis claimed two wickets.The second match of the series will be held in Sylhet on Sunday.

Nalanda College to mark Olcott Day on Feb. 19
The 110th death anniversary and commemoration of Colonel Henry Steel Olcott, the first well-known American of European ancestry to make a formal conversion to Buddhism and the man who engineered a Buddhist renaissance in Sri Lanka (then Ceylon), falls on February 17.
Nalanda College, Colombo, holds an Olcott memorial commemoration programme every year and this year the College has made arrangements to hold the commemoration on a grand scale.
Nalanda College Principal Thilak Waththuhewa speaking about this years Olcott commemoration celebrations said, There is a special reason for Nalanda College to commemorate Col. Henry Steel Olcott. He came to Ceylon on February 17, 1880 and embraced Buddhism on May 19, 1880, at Sri Vidyananda Pirivena, Galle. At that time, under the British colonial administration, Buddhism and Buddhist education were suffering greatly and the education system of the island was mainly in the hands of missionaries. Col. Olcott decided to visit the island after reports of the Panadura Debate and Buddhism reached him in America. He activated several programmes to uplift Buddhism in the country and one of his major activities was the establishing of the Parama Vingnartha Bouddha Sangamaya with the objective of reviving Buddhism in the island. Then, he started the English Buddhist School, which later became Ananda Vidyalaya, on November 1, 1886, at Malay Street. Along with the opening of that school, the Parama Vingnartha Bouddha Sangamaya started several Buddhist schools throughout the island such as Mahinda College in Galle, Musaeus Girls College, Colombo, Dharmaraja College in Kandy and Maliyadeva College in Kurunegala.
On November 1, 1924, Nalanda Vidyalaya was established as a brother school to Ananda Vidyalaya, attached to that school. Nalanda College was then registered as a separate school on November 1, 1925. Commemorating and valuing such a Man of the Era who did so much to uplift Buddhism and Buddhist education in the country and preserving historical information about the role played by Col. Olcott in the revival of Buddhism in Sri Lanka for future generations is of utmost importance. That why Nalanda College has made a tradition of commemorating and bestowing merit on its founder Col. Henry Steel Olcott annually.
The 110th death anniversary of Col. Olcott commemoration will be on a grand scale because the 87 Group of the Nalanda College OBU headed by Chairman Prasanna de Silva and Secretary Rohan Halwathura made a request for permission to organize the event as most of them will be 50 years this year. So, on February 19, there will be an alms-giving for 50 members of the Maha Sangha including Mahanayakes and Anunayakes of the Malwathu and Asgiri Chapters and other Sangha Chapters to bestow merit of Col. Olcott.
To perpetuate the memory of Col. Olcott and his services to Sri Lankas Buddhism, we have conducted essay and art competitions among the students of the school. All the arrangements are being made by the School Buddhist Society, five Ven. Theras on the school staff, myself and other members of staff and the 87 Group of the Nalanda College OBU.

NCPA requests rest house owners to deny services to minors
The National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) requested all owners of lodgings and rest houses countrywide not to provide room facilities to teenagers, school students or underage couples at any cost, as sex crimes among present youth have been on the rise.
Numerous such cases have been reported to the NCPA during the recent past and many social and voluntary organizations too, have pointed out this situation through their social media channels, recently.
Many adults have seduced female students and later, accompanied them to nearby rest houses, where they proceeded to abuse the girls.
The NCPA had requested owners of lodging places to inspect the NICs of both males and females who arrive seeking rooms.
A programme is currently underway to crack down on lodging places to nab errant rest house owners and sex offenders.
Those who bear information regarding such situations should contact 1929 or the nearest police station, said D. M. Pemasiri, a senior official attached to the Kurunegala district NCPA office, yesterday.

Not meant for ladies!
Long johns, the underpants Victorian men wore when they went to bed to snore, now women wear to cathedrals. Another form of common dress is the so-called leggings and flip-flops, notwithstanding the state of their bundy. Men of charm, ability and enterprise who see a heavily pregnant woman trundling towards them in these ghastly outfits, discreetly step aside to avoid getting run over and landing themselves in intensive care and the clutches of waiting white coats who will likely treat them with a banned drug. Western medicine has progressed in leaps and bounds. Betrayals have come from the practitioners, who worship lucre.
Women are now demanding free access to pubs. The aim and purpose of a pub are to encourage unlimited boozing and smoking. To that end, the pub is made very comfortable. For women of luxurious tastes, there is the salon deluxe. For women who are ill at ease in clean surroundings, there is the low doggery. No such comforts await at home.
Husbands are likely to be less polite and probably a good deal less tidy. So women who have free access to a pub will naturally be disposed to anchor themselves on to the foot rails, sit on the high cushioned tripods with a cigarette dangling from their lips, eye the chromatic decanters lined on the shelf filled with measured amounts of fluid ounces and booze until their tortured livers revolt and they are ripe for the undertaker.
Demanding legislation
Today wealthy wives do not care a hoot for their husbands. They use their credit cards and fly away at whim just the way we hopped on to our bikes and pedalled to Lion house for a cup of tea when the University of Ceylon was the pride of Asia. Sadly, those days are no more. Now the oath taken by the bride at a wedding ceremony is so much froth quickly gone with the wind, like the way Sri Lankan Universities have gone unable now to find a place in a rating of 400 Asian Universities.
A wealthy mouse of a man knew his wife has gone to Bali after a friend told him he met her at the Resort. To put on the shoulders of meek husbands, who are often giants by girth, the sins and indiscretions of their wives are out of date and out of fashion. When a wife purchases a high-class flat in a wealthy neighbourhood without seeking the approval of the husband that unilateral act scandalizes only the man with a Victorian mentality. Wives are now demanding legislation to protect themselves against marital rape.
The days when mothers were at the gate to welcome children returning home from school seem to be over. I am aware this is a rash sally because there are still devoted mothers who stay at home to look after their children. But they are a dwindling breed. When I saw my mother at the gate, I quickened my pace into a run since I knew I was entering a place of safety, a sanctuary.
Mothers protect their young
When the hermit monk took me when I was a mere boy of 15 from the Elephant Rock in Kurunegala, to the Tortoise Rock and then the Eeel Rock, from where I would descend to the Wewa that fed water to the town and walk back home, a wild boar crossed our path, followed by a brood of squealing piglets. The monk stretched out his hand and stopped me with the admonition let them pass, the jungle belongs to them. If you are perceived as a threat the mother will attack, tearing your legs to ribbons with her tusks and let you bleed to death. Thats the way in the animal kingdom. Mothers protect their young with a fierce intensity.
Mothers stay at home and protect yourself and your children. The atmosphere in a smoke-filled pub is grim. Fights between bar flies are common. Apart from drunks who pester for free drinks, there are the sharpies. Stay in the safety of the home and enjoy the company of your children. Teach them knowledge is useless without memory. Memory is the foundation of all culture as the ancients showed through the myth of Mnemosyne, Mother of the Muses, the nine goddesses of literature and the arts. Remember there is a time to live and a time to die-Ecclesiastes 3.

Notable decline in excise income
Government excise income had notably declined in 2017, compared to previous years. It is to be reviewed whether this decline is connected to the decrease in the production of alcoholic beverages. However, there is no evidence that neither the production nor the consumption has declined.
Excise Ordinance No. 8 of 1912 has been in effect since January 1, 1913, and levying excise duty is one of the primary duties under the Ordinance.
It is the duty of the Excise Department to issue licenses for the manufacture and sale of alcoholic beverages, as well as to control and monitor their production and storage.
It should be noted that the Excise Department is not an institution that promotes alcohol, but one which is entrusted with the proper levying of excise duties. It is this mechanism which has failed in raking in the income of excise taxes. Recent statistics show that the income of the Excise Department which was close to Rs. 130 million in 2016, had decreased to Rs. 110 million in 2017.

Parenting a new puppy for many happy dog-years
Puppies are without a doubt some of the most adorable things on the planet. Parenting a new puppy, however, is no walk in the park. Heres a guide to help you care for the new addition to the family.
When the time comes to finally bring your new puppy home for the first time, you can pretty much count on three things: unbridled joy, cleaning up your puppys accidents, and a major lifestyle adjustment. As youll soon learn, a growing puppy needs much more than a food bowl and a doghouse to thrive. And while it may be a lot of work initially, its well worth the effort. Establishing good and healthy habits in those first few sleep-deprived weeks will lay the foundation for many dog-years of happiness for you and your puppy.
1. Find a good vet
The first place you and your new puppy should go together is, you guessed it, straight to the vet for a checkup. This visit will not only help ensure that your puppy is healthy and free of serious health issues, birth defects, etc., but it will help you take the first steps toward a good preventive health routine. If you dont have a vet already, ask friends for recommendations. If you got your dog from a shelter, ask their advice as they may have veterinarians they swear by. Local dog walkers and groomers are also a great source of ideas.
2. Make the most of your first vet visit
Ask your vet which puppy foods he or she recommends, how often to feed, and what portion size to give your pup.Set up a vaccination plan with your vet.Discuss safe options for controlling parasites, both external and internal.Learn which signs of illness to watch for during your puppys first few months.Ask about when you should spay or neuter your dog.
3. Shop for quality food
Your puppys body is growing in critical ways which is why youll need to select a food thats formulated especially for puppies as opposed to adult dogs. Look for a statement from the Association of American Feed Control Officials (AAFCO) on the packaging to ensure that the food you choose will meet your pups nutritional requirements.
Small and medium-sized breeds can make the leap to adult dog food between 9 and 12 months of age. Large breed dogs should stick with puppy kibbles until they reach 2-years-old. Make sure your puppy has fresh and abundant water available at all times.
Feed multiple times a day:
Age 6-12 weeks  4 meals per day
Age 3-6 months  3 meals per day
Age 6-12 months  2 meals per day
4. Establish a bathroom routine
Because puppies dont take kindly to wearing diapers, housetraining quickly becomes a high priority on most puppy owners list of must-learn tricks. According to the experts, your most potent allies in the quest to housetrain your puppy are patience, planning, and plenty of positive reinforcement. In addition, its probably not a bad idea to put a carpet-cleaning battle plan in place, because accidents will happen.
Until your puppy has had all of her vaccinations, youll want to find a place outdoors thats inaccessible to other animals. This helps reduce the spread of viruses and disease. Make sure to give lots of positive reinforcement whenever your puppy manages to potty outside and, almost equally important, refrain from punishing her when she has accidents indoors.
Knowing when to take your puppy out is almost as important as giving her praise whenever she does eliminate outdoors. Heres a list of the most common times to take your puppy out to potty. When you wake up.
Right before bedtime.
Immediately after your puppy eats or drinks a lot of water.
When your puppy wakes up from a nap.
During and after physical activity.
5. Watch for early signs of illness
For the first few months, puppies are more susceptible to sudden bouts of illnesses that can be serious if not caught in the early stages. If you observe any of the following symptoms in your puppy, its time to contact the vet.
Lack of appetite
Poor weight gain
Vomiting
Swollen of painful abdomen
Lethargy (tiredness)
Diarrhea
Difficulty breathing
Wheezing or coughing
Pale gums

6. Teach obedience
By teaching your puppy good manners, youll set your puppy up for a life of positive social interaction. In addition, obedience training will help forge a stronger bond between you and your puppy.
Teaching your pup to obey commands such as sit, stay, down, and come will not only impress your friends, but these commands will help keep your dog safe and under control in any potentially hazardous situations. Many puppy owners find that obedience classes are a great way to train both owner and dog. Classes typically begin accepting puppies at age 4 to 6 months.
Tip: Keep it positive. Positive reinforcement, such as small treats, has been proven to be vastly more effective than punishment.
7. Be sociable
Just like obedience training, proper socialization during puppyhood helps avoid behavioral problems down the road. At approximately 2 to 4 months of age, most puppies begin to accept other animals, people, places, and experiences. Socialization classes are an excellent way to rack up positive social experiences with your puppy. Just be sure to ask your vet about what kind of interaction is OK at this stage.

Pathfinder Foundation, NMF conduct first bi-lateral dialogue in Colombo
The first bi-lateral conference between the Pathfinder Foundation (PF) and National Maritime Foundation (NMF) focused on developing a platform for analytical and innovative discussion, specifically on Maritime Security and Maritime Domain Awareness covering the Indian Ocean, which would favourably impact countries in the Indian Ocean Region held Colombo Recently.
Admiral R.K. Dhowan with Directors of NMF, Admiral Jayanath Colombage, Director, Centre for Indo-Lanka initiatives at PF with Chairman Bernard Goonetilleke and key resource personalities presented papers of the conference.
The Indian Ocean Region is home to nearly one-third of the worlds population and is of high economic and strategic significance due to its location and traffic that passes through it. It is estimated that nearly half of the worlds containers, one third of bulk cargo traffic and two thirds of oil shipments pass through the Indian Ocean. Also, there is a shift in global economic weight and influence from Atlantic and Pacific oceans to the Indo-Pacific region.
The rise of China to number two position and India to number seven position in the world economic order is a clear example of this economic shift. With a growing population in India and already a large population in China, there will be a requirement to produce and trade more.
First bilateral conference between the National Maritime Foundation and Pathfinder Foundation
Therefore, in the 21st century, the Indian Ocean has become the key ocean for energy, trade and food security. This has led to a new interest in the freedom of navigation and overflight in the Indian Ocean.
The Indian Ocean is also part of global commons and many major trading nations such as the USA, Japan, China, South Korea, Australia and the Asian countries have shown their interest in this ocean. There are some unstable states in this region, which add to the volatility of strategic maritime security. Also, the presence of non-state actors such as pirates, terrorists, hijackers, IUU fishers, religious extremists, and smugglers of weapons/narcotics/humans, make maritime security a complex and dynamic one. Sri Lanka, although a small Island state in the southern tip of the Indian sub-continent, is seen as the epicentre of the Indian Ocean activities. Due to the geographical proximity of the two countries and their vital locations in the Indian Ocean, it is quite logical that India and Sri Lanka jointly take the leadership in ensuring maritime security.
Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA), in which India, Sri Lanka and Maldives are already in agreement to share information on white shipping, can be the area of focus to ensure maritime security in the Indian Ocean.
Pathfinder and National Maritime Foundation representatives at the event.
The rationale to engage in academic discourse on maritime security and MDA in the Indian Ocean was based on the need to develop a policy framework for the attention of policy makers in both the countries. The first bilateral conference between the National Maritime Foundation and Pathfinder Foundation focused on developing a platform for analytical and innovative discussion, focusing specifically on Maritime Security and MDA covering the Indian Ocean, which would favourably impact on the countries in the IOR. The draft of a Code of Conduct for the Indian Ocean was also discussed during this dialogue.
The NMF was represented by its Chairman Admiral RK Dhowan, the Director Vice Admiral Pradeep Chauhan, the Executive Director Captain (Dr.) Gurpreet Khurana. The Pathfinder delegation comprised its Chairman Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke, Senior Fellow Lalith Weeratunga, Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage, Luxman Siriwardene and Gayathri Nanayakkara. The special invitees for this event were Admiral Jayanath Perera, General Daya Rathnayake and Major General Milinda Peiris. Barana Waidyatilleke of Lakshman Kadiragarmar Institute contributed with a paper titled a small states Quest for Indian Ocean Security: The case of Sri Lanka.

Polly Pocket makes a comeback
Barbie may be one of the top dogs when it comes to toys, but those of us over a certain age will remember another Mattel favourite - Polly Pocket.
Your poor parents may also remember all the times they trod on your dinky Polly Pocket pieces with less fondness. Polly Pocket was launched in 1989, originally under Bluebird toys until 1998, when it was taken over by toy-giant Mattel.
Sadly, despite its early nineties success (over 10 million compacts were sold overall), and despite a make-over, Polly Pocket was eventually discontinued.
But not for much longer.
According to Buzzfeed , Polly Pocket is getting a relaunch and theyll be hitting shelves this June. Theyve also been given a new look, with the updated dolls now slightly bigger than the ones of the late eighties.
Polly Pocket was the brainchild of Chris Wiggs, who designed them in 1983 for his daughter, using a powder compact to house the dolls at the start. For now, the re-launch is in the US, where the toy will be rolled out nationwide.
If youve been diligently hanging on to your original Polly Pocket compacts, then they could be worth a lot of money. Rare versions of the toys, which went out of production in 2015, are are being sold on eBay.co.uk for huge sums.

Post elections riots destroying public property in Hambantota
A corrupt political force which was rejected by the people during the Presidential Election and General Election in 2015 is currently engaging in a riot by destroying public property and this is an awful sign of countrys destruction, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa charged.
Issuing a special statement yesterday, Minister Premadasa said that both victory and the defeat of a political party is decided by the people and the inability to celebrate the victory in a peaceful manner shows the indiscipline of the people.
He said, voters have the right to cast their vote for the preferred political parties. So the defeat of a political party is not an offence to face punishments or harassments to the supporters of that party.
Commenting on some incidents of destroying public property in Hambantota by a group of people, Minister charged that all these things have been done to fulfill the desire of a group of people who failed to do anything for the betterment of the public when they remained in power.
Further commenting on that, Minister Premadasa said that he was able to implement a large number of development activities and community services during past three years.The Minister said that the property of a resident of Punchiappujandura in Lunugamwehera who is engaged in self employment had been allegedly destroyed by a group of people and he questioned who is responsible for this crime

A prudent move
President Maithripala Sirisena is set to address the nation today, where he is expected unravel the future course of the unity government. The immediate aftermath of the LG election has brought with it a near paralysis of the entire state apparatus, with confusion reigning over the uncertain political situation. The talk in the offices, buses and the market place is about who will be the Prime Minister, or, who will form the government. Little work is being done while the rumour mill is working overtime.
The jockeying by the partners in the Yahapalanaya government for the Prime Minister's post, no doubt, has compounded the situation. The general public too are finding it difficult to come to terms with the true political situation, what with the local bodies dominated by the Opposition, while the state machinery is in the hands of the central government. The rupee has gone into a tailspin vis-a-vis the dollar, and, the share market too has become vulnerable in the wake of the prevailing political uncertainty. Investor confidence, needless to say, would be at a nadir, as a result of the unity government pulling in different directions, in the aftermath of the LG poll. Even the mundane task of garbage disposal, that went without a hitch in the pre-poll days, has come to a standstill, in certain areas, with the municipal labourers none the wiser as to who is in control. In sum, the country is in a chaotic state, the public keeping their fingers crossed for things to unravel in their proper perspective.
It is in this context that the President's address to the nation carries with it great significance. His, no doubt, will be an unenviable task, given the dynamics at work. However, a firm verdict is expected of him in order to end the current imbroglio. The stalemate cannot be allowed to continue indefinitely.
Above all, the issue of the Premiership should be sorted out sooner rather than later. If the matter is allowed to drag on interminably there is no knowing what chaos the country will be plunged into. This is because it is the Prime Minister, as the head of the Cabinet, who is the captain of the ship, issuing the necessary directives and coordinating the affairs of the state. Besides, a beleaguered Prime Minister cannot be expected to perform efficiently, with a pall hanging over him, though it has to be noted that Premier Wickremesinghe is made of sterner stuff.
We are seeing a rerun of the situation that prevailed in 2002-2004 where the President and PM were at loggerheads. On that occasion, though, the UNP commanded a majority and could not be dismissed, until it eventually was, when CBK, wielded her constitutional powers, after two years. In this instance, President Sirisena is hamstrung, having to wait until February 2020 to dissolve parliament, if he so desires.
While this is being written, talks are continuing apace to fashion out a settlement agreeable to both sides. The President has left the option open. It is reported that he has called upon both, the UNP and SLFP/UPFA, to come up with the numbers. This is after both sides have declared their intention to form a government of their own. Hectic criss-crossing from Paget road to Temple Trees and vise versa by various actors in the current political drama had been taking place during the last few days, in order to patch up differences, or, strike new deals, all of which have left the public more confused and out of their depths.
The bone of contention, of course, is the premier stakes, with various options being floated, the UNP even reviving its Leadership Council proposal that entails decision making powers vested in the Council.
Amidst the tumult, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has lent a sober voice calling for the continuation of the unity government for the full term of the current parliament. Speaking to the media after unveiling a statue of Sir D. B. Jayatilaka to commemorate the 150th birth anniversary of the freedom fighter, the Speaker said that it was his fervent wish that the President and Prime Minister bury the hatchet and work together in unity. I earnestly wish that the two leaders will continue to work together. Let them discuss and arrive at a settlement, he said.
Both leaders should take heed of the Speaker's counsel, ignoring the strident war cries from both sides of the divide. The country cannot be allowed to drift simply because the results of a local government election did not go the government's way.
This would also be the sentiment of all right thinking members of the public holding moderate views, who crave for stability, which is vital for progress.
There is over two years to go before the next parliamentary election and if this infighting is going to continue there is no knowing where the country will be headed for. Both sides should put aside their differences born out of parochial considerations and work as a unit, with the country's future well-being in mind.

Q & A
Power of attorney of foreign citizen
Question:
My mother has a plot of land in Negombo. She passed away recently. I have two sisters and three brothers. Our father has also passed away. Now two of my sisters are living abroad and they are not citizens of Sri Lanka. We are planning to sell the undivided plot of land. My three brothers in Sri Lanka have consented to the transaction. My questions are as below.
1. How can my sisters be involved in this transaction as they are living abroad
2. Can they prepare legal documents as they are not citizens in Sri Lanka
Ramya Negombo
Answer:
Your sisters can prepare power of attorneys and nominate someone to do the transaction on their behalf. Although your sisters are foreign citizens, they can be involved in this transaction as it is the intestate property of your deceased mother.
Last will
Question:
How should a person write a last will What are the legal requirements that are obligatory for such a last will to be valid Does a last will require witness endorsement If witnesses are required, can such witnesses be relatives of the person writing the will I request this information because there are many instances where when a person is not of sound mind due to old age or illness, other persons have produced fraudulent last wills and have used thumb prints of the person to endorse the false will.
Daily News Reader
Answer:
A last will can be executed by a person above 18 with sound mind. Section 4 of the Prevention of Frauds Ordinance has set out the requirements relating to the execution of last wills in Sri Lanka. These requirements are as follows:
1. The will or codicil must be in writing.
2. It must be signed at the foot or end thereof by the testator or some other person in his presence and by his direction
3. Such signature must be made or acknowledged by the testator either (a) in the presence of a licensed notary public and two or more witnesses or (b) in the presence of five or more witnesses.
4. The notary and the two witnesses or the five witnesses must be present at the same time.
5. The notary and the two witnesses must duly attest the execution or the five witnesses must subscribe the will in the presence of the testator.
The signature must be placed in the presence of a licenced notary public and two witnesses or five witnesses. If any of the witness is incompetent, the last will would be invalid. The notary public must be present at the same time and the both witnesses must be present when the signature is acknowledged.
Although the signature must be made in the presence of two witnesses, it is not necessary that they should actually see the testator write. It would be sufficient if they are in such a position that they may if they please, see him writing. In selecting a witness, no person should be indicated to whom or a wife or husband to whom any benefit is conferred under the will. If such a person attests the will, the beneficiary or the wife or husband of the beneficiary who attests the will can take nothing under the will.
However, a last will has to be produced in court for enforcement. If there is a fraud committed on a last will, the parties can challenge the last will when it is produced in court.
Obtaining a death certificate
Question:
If the death of a person is not registered and a death certificate not obtained due to negligence or some other circumstance, how can the children or close relative register such death and obtain a death certificate What is the legal process that must be followed and how long will it take to obtain the death certificate What action must be taken to transact matters in lieu of the death certificate where such certificate is a compulsory requirement
Daily News Reader
Answer:
If a death has not been registered within three months of its occurrence, it can be registered.
The death can only be registered if a period of 25 years has not been lapsed since occurrence of such death.
Persons eligible to do this are as follows:
o Any party having interest of
o One of the parents
There is a specific declaration form which can be produced by a close relation present at the time of death or who took care of the deceased when he or she was ill for the last time or any other interested party.
However if the death certificate is required, it has to be provided.
Transferring ownership
Question:
What is the legal process for a deceased persons children and next of kin to transfer ownership of property and monies in bank accounts to their names What are the documents that are needed for legally transferring such properties Can ownership of such property be transferred legally without the death certificate of the deceased
Daily News Reader
Answer:
First, you have to check whether that person died leaving a last will. If he died without a last will, then the general law on intestate succession applies. According to that, half the property goes to the spouse and the other half to the children. If the value of the property is above Rs. 5,000,000 then his/her heirs should file a testamentary case to divide the property.
If it is below the said amount, the parties can share the immovable property according to the law of succession. If there are no nominees appointed for immovable properties such as fixed deposits, bank accounts, etc, each heir can claim his or her share by producing necessary documents such as marriage certificate, birth certificate, death certificate, etc. However a death certificate is necessary for legal proceedings.
Compensation for accident
Question:
My husband had his own garage. While he was travelling in a three wheeler on October 17, 2014, he met with a fatal accident (he was knocked down by a lorry). The two drivers were produced before the magistrate, but we didnt receive any compensation from the Magistrates Court. Now I am unable to meet the education expenses of my two school-going children. As this accident occurred due to the gross negligence of the lorry driver, can I file a case for compensation
Ruvanthi Habarduwa
Answer:
In such an instance, a money recovery case has to be filed in the District Court where the accident took place, within two years from the date of the accident. Here, the insurance companies of both the three-wheeler and the lorry should be made parties in your case. The compensation will be calculated according to the facts submitted by the companies. You can go to the Legal Aid Commission Centre where the accident took place to obtain assistance to file a money recovery case.
Employment issue
Question:
I worked in a garment factory as a Quality Controller for nearly three years. Due to an offensive and unpleasant situation in my workplace, I resigned from service and my resignation letter was accepted by the employer. I discussed this matter with several people and they advised me that I cant get any relief as I voluntarily resigned from service. I have three school-going children. Can I go to the Labour Tribunal and seek relief
Daily News Reader
Answer:
It is a general acceptance in law that when a workman voluntarily gives his resignation letter and the said letter of resignation is accepted by the employer, then the contract between the employer and the employee comes to an end and thereafter no relief can be sought. However, if you can establish that your resignation letter was obtained by your employer due to some compulsion, then it is not a voluntary resignation. A resignation letter obtained in a situation of unreasonable demotion, unreasonable transfer and unlawful vacation of post is not a voluntary resignation and you can seek relief in terms of the Industrial Dispute Act.

Ranil as PM in new look Yahapalanaya govt.
The Yahapalana government will continue till 2020 with Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister and a Cabinet reshuffle, after correcting its shortcomings with the blessings of President Maithripala Sirisena and subjecting the UNP to a complete re-organisation, UNP Ministers and Parliamentarians said.
They expressed these sentiments after a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees yesterday. Ministers and MPs of the UNP and the United National Front attended this meeting.
Minister Kabir Hashim elucidating said they decided to implement their mandate received from the people in the proper manner.
Everyone present at yesterdays meeting vowed to march forward as one unit and implement a new programme of work.
They also agreed to bring in various changes and amendments as needed by the country and act in unity.
He said the government commanded a majority in Parliament. Anyone who wanted to form a government had to show a majority.
They firmly believed that the unity government should continue. Any individual or party could express contrary views because there is freedom of expression today.
Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said at yesterdays meeting they were informed about the outcome of talks held between the President and the Prime Minister. Everyone present were of the opinion that people oriented decisions should be taken forthwith. They also decided to complete re-organisation work within a week and bring in several attractive changes that would be felt by the people. Minister Daya Gamage said the UNP would join hands with the SLFP to form the administration in several local councils.
Deputy Minister Ashok Abeysinghe said the UNP and SLFP would march forward together in the government. However, a cabinet reshuffle is in the offing. Parliamentarian Kavinda Jayawardene said they of the Jathika Yovun Peramuna would submit a programme to take the UNP forward. They would not run away just because there was a small drawback at the local government election.
Mahinda was afraid that rogues in his party would be in jail if this government continues for the next two years. The President had offered full blessings for the government to move forward. Parliamentarian Nalin Bandara said the UNP and the SLFP had agreed to form a strong government. Its nature was still unclear. Their intention was to move forward correctly, honourably while protecting the President. In 2015 people gave them a mandate on two occasions to form a strong government. Within the next few months people would be able to see whether the decision taken by them at the local election was correct or not. They should resolve the problems encountered by UNP supporters. The Samurdhi movement would be subjected to a major overhaul soon. A decision would be taken about Ministers who had proved to be failures. The netting of rogues and the corrupt and punishing them would be accelerated. President Sirisena had no dislike towards the Prime Minister and more talks would be held with the President about the correct political situation. He said no backbenchers in the UNP had aspirations to become Ministers. Charges that they received Rs 5 million each were completely false.
The allegation that we were consuming liquor, recently, was also a total falsehood. He said no other party or a section of the media could decide on their party leadership and positions. Several other UNP Parliamentarians expressing their views said many of their problems were resolved at the meeting.
They were all behind the stance that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should continue in his post.

Report on Grandpass building collapse handed over soon
The owner of the building that was under construction, adjoining the building that collapsed on Wednesday in Grandpass, had reported to the Grandpass Police yesterday. The police had recorded a statement from him.
The National Building Research Organisation had inspected the collapsed building yesterday, while the report by them pertaining to their findings is expected to be handed over to the police shortly.
Seven people, including the owner of Adam Expo, a spice exporting organisation, died in the building collapse, on Wednesday, while two others who sustained serious injuries in the collapse are currently receiving treatment in the ICU of the Colombo National Hospital.
Meanwhile, a niece of the deceased owner of the collapsed building, Farida Abir giving evidence before the Colombo Coroners Court yesterday, during the inquest said she suspected her brother of being behind the collapse of the building. She said her uncle, Thahir Abbas Gulamhusein, had lodged a complaint on the morning of the incident at the CID through his lawyer over a financial transaction of the company and this incident had happened that same afternoon.
She alleged that her brother had forged the signature of her uncle fraudulently together with another person and obtained over Rs.50 million from various institutions. Hence, she told court that she suspects that her brother directly had a hand in the building collapse.
A team comprising Consultant Colombo Judicial Medical Officer S.D.Channa Perera, W.A.C. Lakmali, Sasani D. Mallawarachchi, K. Wasuthewa, N.I. Hapugoda and Ali Haron conducted the post-mortem examinations on the seven victims of the collapsed building.
Further in her evidence, Farida Abir said her uncle Thahir was married and had two children. She said her uncle was the Managing Director of the spice export business, which is known as Adam Expo.
The other partner in the business had been her father who had died earlier.
However, cases had been filed at the district court and the Maligakanda Magistrates Court over the properties.
Based on evidence and the relevant medical reports, the Colombo Inquirer into Sudden Deaths M. Ashroff Rumi had decided to accept her evidence and ordered police to produce the Government Analysts Report and the Engineers Report of the building, in court on March 7.
Those killed in the building collapse were, Thahir Abbas Gulamhusein (51), Dorairajah Lalitha (44), Ellaman Rajeswari (46), Shaul Hameed Naleema (63), Jeyaram Sujeewa Anath (42) and Adigamage Kasun Dhananjaya (19).

Royal-Wesley clash for 125th time
The second oldest inter-school cricket fixture in the country will be played at Campbell Park on the 16th and 17th February 2018 for the 125th year between two of the finest educational institutions, Royal College and Wesley College for the Sir Frank Gunesekera Shield.
The first encounter between the two schools was played in 1893 at San Sebastian Hill, Hultsdorf which was the home ground of the Royalists. Royal was Captained by F.S. De Silva while Percy de Bruin captained Wesley. The Royalists won the inaugural encounter by 53 runs. The only break in the series came in 1943 when the grounds of both schools were taken over by the British during the Second World War.
The shield is named after a famous Ceylonese Senator, an old Royalist Sir Frank Gunesekera who was the Deputy President of the Senate of Ceylon in 1948. Both Sir Frank and Dr. Lucien had connections with both Royal and Wesley. Although both were educated at Royal, Sir Frank resided close to Wesley at the junction of Campbell Place and Baseline Road near the Welikade prisons. His two brothers Eric and Donald both studied at Wesley and played cricket for school in 1908 and 1910. The former ended up as Vice Principal and lived at Karlsruhe Gardens right in front to the Wesley Principal and Vice Principals bungalow. Their sister Irene too lived there.
Sir Frank, whose portrait hangs in the Royal College hall, was a brilliant student winning the Thoburn prize for the Best All-Rounder in 1904. The chief guest Sir Henry Blake predicted success in whatever career he chose. Five generations of Gunesekeras have studied at Royal and Wesley College, including Eric, Donald, Elmer, Terrance, Lal, Chrysantha, Nalin, Rohith, Hiran, Sharmal, Sivaji, Shivantha, Rajiv, Tharindra and Anujith.
It was in 1969 that Dr. Lucien Gunesekera presented the Sir Frank Gunesekera Shield in memory of his father which Wesley became the first recipient in the famous last ball victory under the leadership of Amaresh Rajaratnam. Sporting declarations by both sides made the match one of the, if not the most interesting of the 125 encounters played between the two schools.
Batting first, Wesley scored 260 for 9 while Royal replied with 207 for 7. With a lead of 53 runs in the first innings, Wesley declared at 105 for 8, setting the Royalists a target of 158.
The game ended in one of the most thrilling finishes when the Royalists were bowled out for 148 in the last ball of the last over of the game, giving Wesley a famous 9 run win.
Wesleys reign was short lived, as Royal won it back the following year, leaving Wesley with no option but to wait for another 42 years to taste victory, reclaiming the trophy in 2012 under the captaincy of Ashen Fonseka.
The centenary encounter was played as a three-day match played at the P.Sara Oval in 1993 where Royal was captained by Gamini Perera and Wesley was captained by Teheran Rasool. After bowling Wesley out for 103 runs, Royal posted a mammoth total of 411 for 6 with the Captain himself scoring an unbeaten 152. The match ended within two days when Wesley was skittled for 112 in their second innings, giving the Royalists an emphatic innings and 196 run victory. Nalliah. Rajans brilliant bowling earned him a match bag of 10 for 43.
In 1906, C. A. Perera of Wesley made 108, becoming the first ever Wesleyite to score a century against Royal. Another interesting feature of this longstanding encounter was when Danesh Dissanayake scored centuries against Royal in 1988 and 1989 while his father Edmund Dissanayake too scored 107 in 1946. They remain the only father-son duo to score centuries against Royal.
The record for the highest individual score is held by the former Royal skipper Chulaka Amarasinghe who scored an unbeaten 207 in 1983 while Roshan Davids 199 in 1990 stand as the highest for the Wesleyites. M.L. Warish holds the bowling record for Wesley against Royal taking 9 for 17 in 1897. Warishs match bag of 14 for 48 in that match still continues as a record for both schools.
Over the 125 years both schools have produced some outstanding and great cricketers, a few that come to mind are Dr. C.H. Gunasekera, Sargo Jayawickrema, Col .F.C. De Saram, Sathi Coomaraswamy, C.I. Gunasekera, Gamini Goonasena, Fritzroy Crozier, Darrel Lieversz, Jayantha Amerasinghe, Gajan Pathmanathan, Asitha Jayaweera, Ranjan Madugalle, Rohan Jayasekera, Sumithra Warnakulasuriya, Sudath Pasqual, Asantha De Mel, Chulaka Amarasinghe, Roshan Jurangpathy, Jehan Mubarak and Kushal Janith Perera from Royal with the famous M. Sathasivam, S. Gunasekera, R.L. Kannangara, A. Mylvaganam, S. Nagendra, I.H. Walbeoff, H.L. A. Matthysz, Edmund Dissanayake, Lucky Goonetilleke, M.N. Samsudeen, Lou Adihetty, the Claessen brothers, Bryan, Radley and Herman, the Harmer brothers Russell, Mervyn and Granville, Darrell Maye, the Jeganathan twins, Sritheran and Hariharan the Fuard brothers, Ansar and Abu, L.C.R. Wijesinghe, Amaresh Rajaratnam, Tyronne Jansz, Dilangen Jayasekera, Mahendra Dissanayake, Ganesh Mylvaganam, Navin De Silva, Sanjeeva Wijesingha, Dharshika Jayakody, Roshan David, Danesh Dissanayake, Farveez Mahroof and more recently Ishan Jayaratne and Jeffrey Vandersay playing for Wesley. Some of these gentlemen went on to represent the country.
The Royalists are the current holders of the shield, having won it in 2015 under the captaincy of Harith Samarasinghe.
Giving a synopsis of the second oldest schools cricket fixture in the island leading to the 125th year, Royal have won 50 with Wesley winning 22 encounters while 52 matches were drawn.
Celebrating the 125 years of cricketing encounters in 2018, the Royalists will be looking to hold on to the Sir Frank Gunesekera shield under the Captaincy of Pasindu. Sooriyabandara while the Wesleyites under the leadership of Thusaraka Akmeemana will be shifting all gears to bring the shield back to Karlsruhe Gardens. Whatever the outcome may be both sides are bound to provide the cricket loving spectators an entertaining game.
The Chief Guest for this memorable encounter will be former Wesley and Sri Lanka Schools under 19 cricket captain, Capt. Navin De Silva. Navin began playing 1st XI cricket in 1978 and ended captaining Wesley in 1981and 1982. He was a dashing batsman who feared no bowler and a right arm fast medium bowler deceptive with speed.
Many of his knocks were dazzling and worth going miles to watch. Considered to be one of the finest cricket captains in the 80s, Navin was selected to lead the Sri Lankan schools team on its first ever cricket tour to England in 1981 with Arjuna Ranatunga as his deputy.
The tour was a success with Sri Lanka remaining unbeaten a great achievement at that time. The side consisted of players of the calibre of Aravinda De Silva, Marlon Von Haght, S.H.U. Karnain, Graham Labrooy and Rumesh Ratnayake. Navin went on to be adjudged the best schools captain and best all-rounder in school cricket in 1981.
Invitation to past cricket captains of Royal and Wesley
To commemorate the 125th cricket encounter between the two schools, the past captains of both Royal and Wesley are invited to be present at 2.30 pm on Saturday, the 17th February 2018 for a photograph after which a special memento will be presented to them.
To confirm their presence, all captains could contact rose on telephone no. 0112691339 on any working day between 9.00 am and 2.30 pm, until 14th February 2018.

RTI, One year on
This is a story that had it happened one year ago, people would not have believed.
A Sri Lankan citizen, acting in his private capacity, asked the Bureau of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation, how many former LTTE cadres they rehabilitate annually.
He was ignored. So he asked again. Again he was ignored.
Instead of giving up, this man, one Tharindu Jayawardena, took his request to a court of law. After summoning representatives of the Bureau for testimony, they ordered the information, everything Jayawardena asked for, be released. This is the power of the Right to Information law, which turns one year old this month.
Advocates in civil society point to the Right to Information Commission, the legal body which is set up to hear cases where information requests are rejected or ignored, as a major reason for the laws early success.
One year ago, it was a voyage into the unknown, said Asoka Obeyesekere, the Executive Director of the anti-corruption nonprofit Transparency International Sri Lanka. One thing that is clear is that the approach of the RTI commission has been very promising.
Bolstered by strong implementation, the RTI law is changing the way citizens are able to interact with their government. Many challenges still exist, but the portrait of RTIs first year is a positive one.
RTIs watchdog
The RTI Commission is an independent, five-member body charged with monitoring that public authorities are following the terms of the act.
Under the law, if peoples RTI requests are rejected, they can appeal to the public authority they are requesting from. If they are rejected again, they can appeal to the commission.
In its first year, the body received over 400 of such appeals, according to data released by the commission. And there are more on the way.
In the last two months, we have received 80 new appeals, said RTI Commission Director General Piyathissa Ranasinghe in an interview.
Some of these appeals are straight forward. Take the case of G. Dileep Amuthan, of Jaffna, who requested information from the Northern Provincial Council Agriculture Ministry about funds allocated to a conservation project.
The Ministrys information officer told Amuthan that they didnt have the information he was asking for, commission records to show. Unsatisfied, Amuthan appealed to an appeals officer, who did not reply within the timeline specified by law.
When Amuthan appeared before the RTI Commission on November 2 of 2017, the commissioners ordered the Ministry to release the information within a week. They complied.
Other cases, however, like the one involving statistics on LTTE cadres, are more complex.
Hearing records show that commissioners grappled with their decision on whether to order the Bureau of Rehabilitation to release its data.
It appears the Rehabilitation Authority skirted the RTI law in ways which the commission had to untangle.
When Jayawardena, the requester, first called an information officer of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation, he said the government official asked for details about who he was and why he wanted the information.
This is clearly a breach of the law, the commission pointed out, which says a citizen making a request for information shall not be required to give any reason for requesting the information or any other personal details.
Later, at the hearing, representatives of the Bureau argued that the information could not be released because it would affect the privacy of former LTTE cadres and undermine national security. These are both valid exemptions under the RTI law.
But Jayawardena showed that the Bureau had already released the exact data he was asking for up until the year 2014.
The numbers are still publicly available on the Bureaus website.
In the past, the Bureau of the Commissioner-General of Rehabilitation had apparently even released photographs of former child soldiers.
The commissioners said that in view of this, the public authoritys defense appears to be unsustainable, according to the hearing records.
However, they deferred to the Bureaus representatives, asking them to submit the 2014-2017 data first to them before they decided whether or not to make the information public.
When information officers of the Bureau returned with the requested information in this past January, the commissioners ordered them to release it.
What is being requested here is statistical information with no personal details (names, addresses) included, they wrote in their order. Therefore, there is no real risk of possible harmful consequences being caused to those who have been/are being rehabilitated.
In fact, positive effects of disclosure and examples of rehabilitated cadre carry the potential of a positive impact on the reconciliation process, they added.
Speaking to the Daily News, RTI Commission Director-General Ranasinghe said the data would be made available to the public in the beginning of March.
The spirit of RTI
A case review by Transparency International found that in all the cases that the RTI Commission has concluded so far, it has sided with the release of information about 84 percent of the time.
The RTI Commission has taken a progressive approach to information disclosure in most instances, said Sankhitha Gunaratne, Transparencys Right to Information Manager.
She noted that in the beginning of the year, with a small staff and very limited funding, they did not refuse to hear cases.
I think the spirit of RTI is very much embodied within the commission, said Obeyesekere, Transparencys Executive Director.
There are other bright spots in RTIs first year. Transparency International Sri Lanka has helped citizens file 610 RTI requests, according to their own statistics, and the Sarvodaya Foundation has helped file an additional 233.
Many of those requests have yielded positive results. Thushani Kandilpana, of Transparencys Matara unit, said a teacher approaching retirement used RTI after receiving conflicting messages from the local office regarding her pension.
After submitting the request, an education officer said they had misplaced the teachers files and would solve the situation for her.
But there have also been some horror stories. According to Gunaratne, when some people tried to file requests with a housing authority office, the local officers pushed back so much that the confrontation ended in a brawl.
Obeyesekere said early uneven implementation of the law was widely expected.
From the states perspective, you have bureaucrats who have been nurtured on the establishment code, who now how have to administer open government, he said. On the other side, you also have citizens who are also unaccustomed to formally requesting information.
He said state agencies need to better make people aware of their constitutional right to information.
There is still more that needs to be done, particularly I feel on the part of the state media, who actually communicate to the public on the fact that they have (this right), he said.
For his part, RTI Commission Director-General Ranasinghe says the body will continue to take the same approach theyve used so far.
Our funding is not a problem now, he said. According to him, President Sirisena approved their Rs. 55 million budget.
Were approved to hire 20 people full-time, he said. We didnt have them up until now, they were only temporary.
Training workshops for government authorities information officers are held by the Finance and Mass Media Ministry, he said.
With the commission on track to conclude all of its 2017 cases by the end of March, supported by a new budget, they show no signs of stopping. Now citizens just need to keep filing.

Sagala ready to step down
Issuing a special communiqu, Law, Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayaka announced that he is willing to sacrifice his ministerial portfolio in the best interest of his party, the United National Party.
He had conveyed this personal decision at a meeting with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday morning.
Subsequently, he has also informed the Parliamentary Group Meeting of the UNP about his decision.
I am prepared to sacrifice any position on behalf of the UNP and Ive always given my utmost and will do my best for the future of the UNP, he said.
I will not waiver in my decision. However, I am prepared to take over any other position offered by the party leadership, Minister Ratnayaka said.
The Minster had reportedly said that he has come under undue criticism from several quarters including President Maithripala Sirisena who had raised concerns. As there are discussions pertaining to a Cabinet reshuffle, the Minister announced that he was willing to give up his position.
This will enable the Prime Minister to appoint a suitable person to my position. My loyalty to the party will remain as strong as ever, he said. The Ministers decision comes in the wake of attempts made by the UNP and the UPFA to show majority support in the 225-member Legislature.

SC directs EC to file objections over Elpitiya PS election
The Supreme Court yesterday directed the Election Commission (EC) to file its objections regarding a writ petition filed by the Democratic United National Front (DUNF) in respect of the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha election.
On January 30, the Supreme Court had issued an Interim Order preventing the Elections Commission from taking further steps to proceed with holding the election to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha, until a final determination of a writ petition.
Meanwhile, the Supreme Court fixed the petition for argument on April 3.
Issuing an Interim Order on the Galle District Returning Officer, the Supreme Court observed that there is ample reason to grant relief pleaded by the petitioners.
The Democratic United National Front (DUNF) was founded in 1990 by a group of United National Party dissidents. The party was led by the late Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake.
Three members of DUNF filed this petition in the Supreme Court naming Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
They sought an order in the nature of Writ of Mandamus directing the Returning Officer appointed for the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha to accept the nomination paper delivered to the Election Officer by the authorised agent of the DUNF for the election of members to the Elpitiya Pradeshiya Sabha.
Three petitioners Vithanage Ariyaratne, Thilak Opatha, Ariyawansa Dissanayake (party secretary) had filed this petition naming Assistant Commissioner of Elections (Galle District), Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and several others as respondents.
The nomination papers handed by the DUNF were rejected for the reason that they have been handed over by a person who is not the authorized agent.
Presidents Counsel Srinath Perera appeared for the petitioners.
Deputy Solicitor General Viveka Siriwardena appeared for the Election Commission.

Sri Lanka using MCC grant assistance for infrastructure development
Following its competitive selection by the U.S. Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) for grant assistance, the Government of Sri Lanka is now focusing on improving transport infrastructure and land administration in the country, consistent with the governments Vision 2025.
Investing in these sectors will help create the foundation for economic growth with equity. After reviewing the Government of Sri Lankas (GoSL) proposal, MCC agreed to proceed with further due diligence to develop a compact with Sri Lanka by the end of this year.
The MCC is a U.S. Government development agency dedicated to reducing poverty through economic growth. Sri Lanka became eligible for MCC funding in December 2016, having met its criteria for the protection of democratic rights, economic freedom, and investing in its people. In March 2017,the GoSL recruited a compact development team in the Policy Development Office at the Prime Ministers Office.
Working with MCC counterparts, the compact development team completed an analysis of potential activities in the transport and land sectors that could promote economic growth,while consulting a broad array of stakeholders in government, the private sector and civil society. Potential project ideas were evaluated against several factors, including likely economic impact, ability to implement within five years, sustainability, and poverty profile of expected beneficiaries.
In November 2017, the government submitted a funding proposal to MCC. Subsequently, the GoSL and MCC launched in-depth due diligence to determine if the activities would meet MCCs investment criteria.
In the transport sector, GoSL and MCC are considering a two-prong strategy.
The first component would reduce traffic congestion in major urban areas and improve transport connectivity between provinces, particularly between lagging regions and markets and ports in the Western Province. Activities under consideration include initiatives to modernise bus services and improve traffic management along heavily congested corridors in Colombo Metropolitan Area. The second component would rehabilitate national roads in lagging regions and catalyze private investment in agricultural logistics facilities.In the land sector, GoSL and MCC are considering activities to improve land administration.
MCC approved the allocation of $ 2.6 million (USD) in compact development funds to support technical feasibility studies on the activities under consideration for the compact.
This amount is in addition to the $7.4 million (USD) that MCC approved and provided to Sri Lanka in June 2017.
Barring any significant changes to the current slate of proposed activities, GoSL hopes to complete the compact development process and sign a compact agreement with MCC by the end of the year. This is a significant achievement. In 2004, though Sri Lanka qualified for a MCC compact, it lost the opportunity due to the subsequent deteriorating country ranking against many global indices. Sri Lanka only qualified again as eligible to be selected for a compact in late 2016 due to the gains it made on democratic rights.

Sri Lankan family allowed to stay in Queenstown, NZ
A Sri Lankan family who won the support of the Queenstown community in their fight against deportation had been given a reprieve. They will be allowed to stay in New Zealand for another year, Nzherald reported.
Clutha-Southland MP Hamish Walker has been supporting the family, Dinesha Amarasinghe, Sam Wijerathne and their three boys Senath, Subath and Binath.
He said the Immigration and Protection Tribunal (IPT) ruled they could stay in New Zealand for the next year on humanitarian grounds, while their residence application was assessed.
"I called Dinesha and Sam this morning  they were both very emotional and so was I.
"Dinesha and Sam have worked incredibly hard to support their children and give them a bright future in New Zealand and this is the outcome they deserve," Walker said, according to Nzherald.
The family had lived in New Zealand for eight years but faced deportation after Dinesha's application for a work visa renewal was declined due to health issues. Their residency application, submitted in 2013, is on hold.
More than 400 people in the Queenstown community marched in November to support the family.
"It was incredibly humbling to see the way people came together to show compassion and an outpouring of love for a family that they respect and we want as part of the Queenstown community," Walker said.
"The Wijerathne family is respected members of the Queenstown community and an example of how migrant workers living, working, and contributing to our communities in positive ways are so valuable to New Zealand, and especially communities like Queenstown and Te Anau."
There was still a lot to do however.
"While today's result is absolutely fantastic, the solution is only temporary and the family still needs to seek residency, Nzherald reported.

Thurstan meet Isipathana in Battle of Brothers
The 55th Battle of Brothers cricket encounter between Isipathana College and Thurstan College is scheduled to be played on February 23 and 24 at the Sinhalese Sports Club grounds.
This was revealed to the media during a press briefing held at the Burgher Recreation Club (BRC) recently. The annual Thurstan-Isipathana Big Match is a much looked forward to event in the schools sports calendar. This is a special occasion for past students of both schools to reunite, for some of them perhaps since leaving school.
The hosts of the match have decided to bring in a 60-over rule as the first innings will be restricted for both teams and the second essay will be conducted as normal conditions in this years encounter.
Thurstan College will be led by Nipun Lakshan who has scored 349 runs with a century in schools matches while Pathana team will be captained by Ayana Siriwardana who has scored over 500 runs. Thurstan College recorded three outright and six first innings wins having played 13 schools matches in the season. The Pathanians have played 11 matches registering six first innings wins and an outright win.
Both teams have yet to establish a worthy record of wins and of the 54 matches played, Thurstan have won five and Isipathana bagged the trophy four times with the rest ending in draws.
The last win in the series was recorded by Isipathana College in 1999 under the captaincy of Krishantha Jayawardene. Thurstan College last won in 1992 under Mackenzie Perera.
The Mini Big Match will be held at Thurstan Grounds on February 16 and 17 while the joint cycle parade between two brother schools will start from Isipathana College and proceed towards Thurstan College on February 22 at 8.30 am. The 38th Limited Over match will be played at P. Sara (Oval) Stadium on March 4 and T20 encounter will be worked off on March 11 at Thurstan Grounds.
Both schools have produced a few Sri Lanka players in Amitha de Costa, Niroshan Bandaratilleke, Hemantha Boteju and Lahiru Kumara all from Thurstan and Jayantha Paranathala, Asoka de Silva, Asantha de Mel, Uvais Karnain, Suresh Perera, Nuwan Zoysa and Sri Lanka's youngest Test cricketer Sanjeewa Weerasinghe from Isipathana.

Unbelievable squeeze!
A mum and former U.S. Navy veteran wears a corset 23 hours a day to maintain her tiny 18 inch waist.
Mum-of-three Diana Ringo, 39, from San Diego, California wears her corset for 23 hours everyday - only taking it off when she showers or works out.
The 5ft 2in Navy wife, who also worked in the Navy as a chef for nine years, started wearing her waist-shrinking garments nearly three years ago after she lost her natural curves following the birth of her four-year-old twin boys.
Instead of losing the 77lbs she put on during pregnancy - making her waist 27-29 inches - with a balanced diet and exercise, Diana decided to get her hourglass figure back by wearing waist-pinching corsets.
Diana said: When I have my corset on, it makes me feel so sexy. I naturally felt so sexy but it just boosted my self-esteem a lot more, it just makes me feel good.
I wasnt happy with my body before because I was fat. Theres nothing wrong with being fat but my fat does not distribute in a feminine way. It distributes as if I have a male body type and I dont like that shape.
Diana, now a chef, has more than 45 corsets in her closet, costing 1,400, to help her maintain her 18 inch waist and hourglass frame.
She said: When I dont have the corset on it feels like when you take off your bra. You get a little bit of light relief I guess is the right word, but you want to put it back on because youre just used to it by now.
Right now I weigh between 118-120 lbs. My dress size is around 2-4 but I have to take in the waist because I really like to show what I have accomplished even though I sometimes get dirty and wtf looks.
Although her husband Brett Ringo, 33, an officer in the Navy, had initial concerns with her strict corset training, he eventually came to terms with her new image and way of life - even if he still has reservations and says he does not want her to go any smaller.
Diana said: My family is torn between its okay and some of my family think Im gonna die today maybe tomorrow.
I do value their opinion about what they have to say about corset training or corsets but I ultimately have to live with myself and the decisions I make are to make myself happy.
Husband Brett said: I was concerned with her health at first when I came back from deployment. Thats when I asked her to go see a doctor. So, she went to get checked out and the doctor said, everything is good.
I dont think she has taken it too far. We did agree that this was the kind of base line. We have an agreement that she is not going to get any smaller.
The training has increased her self-confidence. They always say happy wife, happy life. So, this makes her happy.
Diana added: Ultimately I will do what I want, I am a grown woman and I pay taxes. Most importantly I do what makes me happy because if I am, then he will be too, especially if Im feeling sexy he gets rewarded with sex because of how I feel.
I always wear my corset even when intimate. I have my husband grab my cords to get a good grip of me.
While the curvaceous Latina loves her shapely figure, she receives stares and eye-rolls from parents when she takes her children to school, who think shes setting a bad example to their kids about body image.
Diana said: On the street I get things like what the fudge or oh my god.
I can read peoples lips sometimes and I know that they are talking about me because they wrap their hand around their waist with their eyes bulging.
Then I get some people that are like oh my God how did you do that, I want to do that.
The one thing I notice all the time is if Im walking toward someone they immediately look down at themselves and then look at me comparing or like how is that even possible that kinda thing. Im used to it now though.
Diana said: I eat everything. There is nothing I cant eat. What I cant do is over eat. I just cant, its like having a lap band on the outside of your body rather than on your stomach, your tummy will not allow you.
I can breathe properly in my corset. I just cant take tremendous full breaths while Im wearing it and nobody lives their lives taking tremendous full breaths.
I trust corsets if made and used correctly to make my waist smaller, as I used them and saw the results the more I was convinced that this was the right choice for me.
She said: I do not want to get my ribs removed I have no interest in doing that.
I dont think it would make that much of a difference.
This is important to me because it makes me feel good. It makes me feel sexy and I mean if I feel good and Im happy, I go with that.

Construction sector challenged  by continued labour shortage
RIU Report 2018: The construction industry is worth approximately USD 8 bn and is already under strain owing to rising construction costs. This industry is challenged by a shortage in skilled construction workers due to two factors; firstly, there is a large number of potential labour who seek employment as trishaw drivers and secondly, due to worker migration to the Middle East where there is a much higher earning potential.
The Department of Census and Statistics recently released a report on labour demand according to which there is a great demand for elementary occupations from employers. Elementary occupations such as cleaners and laborers, involve routine tasks and physical effort which require minimum educational qualifications to enter. This category comprises the largest employment group in the construction sector and the second largest in the industry sector. By the time of the survey last year, the construction industry required closer to 10,000 labourers.
The shortage of labourers has affected the manufacturing sector as well. Currently the most demanded elementary jobs are security guards, manufacturing labourers, cleaners, and helpers who are critical for industry operations.
The current average salary of an elementary worker is Rs 19,654 which is the least paid employment group according to this report. A study conducted by the Research Intelligence Unit (RIU) found out that elementary workers supplement their salary with an average variable income of Rs 4,008 which is in the form of incentives and overtime payments. Therefore, average total income would reach closer to Rs 25,000. Despite this, the RIU analysis shows that the average income expectation of this segment is to be in the range of Rs 30,000 to 35,000.This is about a20 to 40 per cent increase in worker remuneration. As a result, there is an upward pressure on overall payments to labourers fueled by the shortage.
The industry is plagued with a high labour turnover and increasing labour demand has resulted in long delays for work to be completed. Some factors leading to labor turnover among female elementary workers identified in RIU report is given below.
RIU Economist, Lalinda Sugathadasa said the increase in wages can cause the cost of construction to go up by at least 7 percent. In its latest study, RIU has also observed changing behavioural dynamics among this employment segment in terms of commuting, lodging, workweek, and job desirability.

Earnest politics, a must for peaceful country
Engaging in politics, in whatever capacity, is the same as paving a road to the underworld. Where politicians are concerned, except for a few individuals, all others are hypocrites and thieves. The number of honest politicians is insignificant, said Ruwanweli Chaithyaramadhikari Chief Sanghanayaka in Nuwarakalaviya Ven. Pallegama Hemarathana Nayaka Thera.
According to the results of the recent local government polls, it was reported that 26 Bikkhus have been voted into local government bodies. The Nayaka Thera said, personally, he was against any Bikkhu from getting involved in politics, even as an independent candidate. "Unending chaos will descend upon this country until a people-friendly, spiritually-advanced political stream replaces the present corrupt politics. The wise shall understand this situation."
"We should endow a fair and civilized country to future generations. Bikkhus currently engaging in politics should understand this and perform their duties according to the teachings of the Buddha," Hemarathana Nayaka Thera added.

Nippon Maru voyage reconciles nations
The ship Nippon Maru carrying 243 youth from around the world, was anchored at the Colombo Port, today, providing those on board the opportunity to discuss solutions to issues of their countries, said National Youth Council (NYC) Director General Erandika Weliange, yesterday.
He was addressing the media conference held on board the Nipon Maru ship which made its 29th visit to the country, yesterday, as a part of the Ship for World Youth (SWY) programme organized by the Cabinet Office of the Japanese Government.
He added that another objective of this annual voyage was to build reconciliation, peace and friendship among nations and that the voyage includes participants from 11 countries, including 12 from Sri Lanka.
The Nippon Maru would be docked at Colombo Port until February 17, and the programme would conclude at Yokohama Port, Japan, on February 29.
He further said the youth aboard the ship would take part in many events and programmes in the country until Friday.
They would join a study tour with students of the Colombo University and ten field visits have been organized for them to take part in. He added that there would be a cultural show at the Maharagama Youth Centre on Friday, in which these youths would also perform.
He also said that around Rs. 4 million was spent on each youth by the Japanese government and added that participants of earlier voyages have been quite productive that most of them have become parliamentarians, editors, and presidents counsels.
A welcome ceremony was held at the Port with the participation of National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera.
The participants were scheduled to meet the President and the Prime Minister as well, yesterday.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Additional Secretary Dr. K. A. S. Keeragala, Sri Lankan Embassy in Japan Senior Advisor Janaka Bandaranaike, Alumni Chairman Buddhika Iddamalgoda, National Youth Council Director Sunil Karunaratne, and leader of the Sri Lankan participants Chamal Randunu Amaraweera also addressed the occasion.

Political climate no barrier  to economic activities
The indecisive political atmosphere prevailing in the country will not have a profound effect on overall market conditions, a senior investment advisor attached to the SC Securities said.
There will also be no impact on the economy or to company fundamentals whichever party comes to power or secure majority votes at any elections.It is also too early to predict whether the performance of businesses will have an impact or taxes will be increased or decreased due to the different policy initiatives of the political party who won the recently concluded local government elections.
The official said relaxing or changing some existing regulations or direct taxes imposed on companies will however have a considerable impact on the overall economy and market activities. Commenting on direct taxes imposed on companies, he noted that the present government imposed a number of direct taxes on companies compared to the previous government, which had a negative impact on overall performance of corporate institutions.
The official also stressed the need of coming up with proactive polices to attract large inflows of foreign funds into the Colombo Stock Exchange to achieve desired targets, both in the capital market and Sri Lankan economy.
In the meantime, the Colombo Stock Exchange recently announced that the record breaking foreign investment in the Sri Lankan stock market has continued into 2018, with Rs 4 billion in net foreign inflows.
January 2018 posted a new record for the first month of any given year recording Rs. 10.7 billion in foreign purchases in the market, while foreign investors made sales worth Rs. 6.7 billion, which has established a record breaking start to the year in terms of net foreign purchases.
Meanwhile, the Sri Lankan rupee also hit a record low rate of 155.90 against the dollar Wednesday on heavy demand for dollars from importers.

Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy said only monies and investments amounting to Rs. 13 billion have been retained from Perpetual Treasuries.
Apart from Rs. 13 billion, no other properties or resources of Perpetual Treasuries have been retained, he said.
He was addressing the media, yesterday at the Central Bank Auditorium while participating in a special press conference.
The governor said measures are being taken to surcharge the monies earned by Perpetual Treasuries in a just manner.
The amount to be surcharged should be calculated through a legal procedure, and not by the Central Bank, he added.
The Central Bank would assist the courts procedure. The Perpetual Treasuries Company is responsible to pay the due amount described by the courts, Senior Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe said.
He added that owing to the Treasury Bond issue, an increase of interest rates could be monitored.
The Central Bank Finance Committee has not imposed a ban on investing money from employees' provident funds (EPFs) in the share market. However, the Central Bank has not considered investing EPF monies in the share market at this juncture, he said.
He added that EPF monies are currently limited only to be invested in primary and secondary markets.
However, it has been scheduled to invest these monies in a more systematic and developed process, he added.

Increased sanctions relief could open new opportunities for trade with Sri Lanka, Chief of the Political Section of the Iranian Embassy in Colombo Ayoub Heidari said.
Even, with sanctions, we have relations with Sri Lanka, he said. He was speaking at a conference organized by the Pathfinder Foundation on Thursday. He said if sanctions were lifted on the banking sector, Sri Lanka and Iran could increase their trade in products such as tea, oil, dates, and nuts.
Earlier this week, delegations from Iran and Sri Lanka signed new trade cooperation agreements at a ceremony in Colombo.
Addressing the conference, Dr. Mohsen Eslami, a Professor of International Relations from the Tarbiat Modares University in Tehran, said that Iran will stay committed to the nuclear agreement even if the United States pulls out.
He said even if President Donald Trump exits the agreement, as he has signaled he is open to, Eslami said he believes Iran could continue the agreement with its European partners, as well as Russia and China.
Some countries, European countries, want to manage and use their lobby to keep the (agreement) going, he said. Iran is following our end of the commitment. We are obeying the commitment, but the American side doesnt want to do the same.
He said the nuclear deal, which was brokered in 2015, signaled a new era of Iranian diplomacy.

AMBROSE was a wily fox at Fox Hill Racing
Not so long ago, it was the Grand Prixs, hill climbs and track racing. But now the in thing in this form of sport is Fox Hill and Go kart Racing.
Grand Prixs saw even foreigners wanting to show their expertise and skills in the racing cars they brought along with them. Two names that come to mind are that of the Maharaj of Gondal and Britisher Chris Meek.
Though they could not win, what with Sri Lankas champion driver David Pieris on his Arpico Special driving dare devil style leaving the opponents far behind their participation added glamour to the sport.
Pieris suffers flat tyre
I was Sports Editor of the Times Group with photographer A.C.M. Zahir and were witnesses among thousands of motor racing fans who watched Pieris complete the Grand Pix race and earn the chequered flag steering the vehicle like a Sterling Moss on a flat tyre to be crowned the champion at the Katunayake air strip in Grand Prix event.
Before going on to describe the motor bike racing champions of that era which was the 1970s and 1980s,whic eras will never come again, I would like to feature an youngster SHANAKA AMBROSE in name who in the1980s burnt the track on his motor bikes winning many events and then taking the Fox Hill racing scene by storm.
AMBROSE came from a family that was crazy of motor bikes. His father Noel was the owner of a motor car and SHANAKA still in his early years would sit on the lap his father who was driving and imagine he was doing the steering. Such was his craze to be behind the wheel and be a champion biker and four wheeler.
Winning events with ease
AMBROSE was a LEGEND on the track. He started his motor racing career in 1984 on a motor cycle and winning events with ease setting up record at Mahagastota, Eliyakade, Radella, Kotmale, St. James and Karandapona races as a champion rider.
AMBROSE who is now domiciled in America with his family was here on a short holiday and it was an experience meeting him and speaking of times when he dominated the racing scene here.
His first comment when I asked him what took him to the top he said that first of all if one is to succeed in the high pressure racing is that one should be fearless.
Car and bike racing is a life threatening sport but if one is fearless and dare take risks success will come automatically.
Treasured moment
His most treasured moment was when he was crowned the SUPER FOX 2000 at the Eighth Caltex Super Cross organized by the Sri Lanka Military Academy in conjunction with the Sri Lanka Association of Racing Drivers and Drivers and sponsored by Caltex. In winning he drove a car called the Caltex Havoline Special.
In winning he recalled the tough resistance he received from drivers of the caliber of Pradeep Jayawardena, Nishan Weerasuriya, Dinesh Deheragoda, Dilantha Malagamuwa and Aravinda Premadasa.
AMBROSE still remembers with nostalgia Rizvy Farook who took a keen interest in his prowess and had given him tyres to compete in the race and his brother Imran, his brilliant mechanic Nandsena and team from Ranga Motors and the evergreen Bri Ponnambalam who himself was a classic driver. He also hadnt forgotten his sponsors Caltex and all others who helped him in his record breaking career.
Favourite bike
Whenever his uncle Tony visits his home on the motor bike, the BSAs being Tonys favourite bike, SHANAKA would get astride it and also imagine he was racing.
As he began to come of age SHANAKA showed his craze to one day get on the racing track and show his prowess. That he was talented in this sport there was no doubt when he first got on a motor bike and took part in a novices event. Although not winning, he got the taste for racing and one day told his mother Winifred that he will someday soon rewrite the racing record books which he finally did.
A passion for BSA bikes
Another who could be tagged a LEGEND was Shanakas uncle TONY who having tried his urge to race failed and then began to believe it or not collect motor bikes of most makes  he had a passion for a range of BSA bikes which were of British makes of every horsepower  in all 35 bikes which also included Norton Manxs and Tiger Triumphs.
Tonys passion for bikes began at a very tender age of 7. But he started riding when he was 19. It all started when his uncle Alex who was Workshop Manager of Cargills  then agents for BSA motor bikes would bring brand new bikes like the Empire Star, Standard Silver and Gold Star models.
He bought his first bike a BSA Bantam 125 cc in 1953. However his love was for motor bikes. Tony has owned 4 Morris Minor cars and is still in possession of two, one CN and one EY registration. Tonys most memorable bikes he owned and still speaks of with awe was the Triumph Tiger Hundred EN 3937 and BSA Shooting Star 4 Sri 4690.
Vintage Car Owners Club
A member of the Vintage Car Owners Club and the Classic Car Club of Ceylon, he is known for his computer-like knowledge of models, registrations numbers, prices, dates and whom he had sold some of his bikes to. In owning 35 bikes and four, four wheelers Tony certainly is a LEGEND in his own style.

Amending law regarding 25 pc quota for women problematic: Secretary
Amending the law to revise the 25 percent quota for female representation at this point is problematic, Local Government and Provincial Councils Ministry Secretary Kamal Pathmasiri said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, he pointed out that any amendments to the Local Authorities Elections Act would only apply to future elections and not the recently concluded Local Government elections.
He made this observation in response to Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, who on Wednesday proposed to amend the law to allow councils to be established even without the mandatory 25 percent quota under special circumstances. The quota of 25 percent for female representation at the Local Government bodies is already the law of the country.
The Election Commission conducted the elections subject to that provision. How can we bring in Amendments with retrospective effect at this stage he questioned.
He added that the Election Commission has so far not informed the Ministry over such a request. The Election Commission must contact the Attorney General and get their legal opinion to resolve the prevailing matters, he noted.
The Election Commission Chairman observed that the Local Government bodies, which do not complete their 25 percent quota for women, cannot establish a council as per the newly introduced law. He proposed revising the law to avoid any injustice to political parties which cannot appoint the set number of female candidates due to having an overhang and cannot choose female candidates from the additional list to make up numbers.

Auditor, audit thyself!
I refer to the press conference given by the Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe on February 7 on the eve of the Local Government elections, where he thought it fit to inform the public of the shortcomings in the Treasury. I believe this is the first time an AG addressed the media to discuss the affairs of a client. If he had compiled a report on the falsification of accounts in the Treasury over the past decade, he should have tabled it in Parliament first and not made a media circus of it. Please consider the following facts.
1. According to my knowledge, a professional Auditor cannot disclose the affairs of a client, unless required to do so by a Court of Law.
2. Auditor General is accountable to report to Parliament, under and in terms of the Constitution. I have not observed any previous Auditors General addressing the media.
3. Such an incredible difference between 10 trillion and 1 trillion just cannot be, as monies come via banking channels and thus get accounted for.
4. IMF and Foreign Credit Agencies carry out incisive due diligence of the data. If this was the case, they would have so reported, even if the difference was very much less. They had not done so.
5. If the Fiscal Management (Responsibility) Act No. 3 of 2003 is correctly processed, then it has to disclose the level of borrowings, including those of Government Corporations and Companies. I believe such reports had not been properly processed.
6. Unqualified Audit Certification (Year 2005 had been adversely qualified) had been given on the Government Accounts for Year 2006 by a previous Auditor General, P.A. Pematilaka, notwithstanding an adverse Special Report under Article 154 (6) of the Constitution by the former Auditor General in July 2006, whereas P.A. Pematilaka had been Director General, State Accounts, Treasury upto October 2006, and could not have audited his own accounts.
7. On a challenge of the Appropriation Bill in 2008, the Supreme Court directed that the Government borrowings be disclosed, and thus a Second Schedule of Borrowings, was included in the Appropriation Bill.
8. The debt service (Capital & Interest) had not been shown in the Appropriation Bill previously.
9. In the recent years, debt service (Capital & Interest) had been almost equal to gross income, thus borrowings financed, expenditures, investments and losses. (eg: Hedging deals)
10. Hence, a proper accounting, including debt service (Capital & Interest) and losses should have been done and that would have shown the correct position, without such a pronouncement of an incredible difference, creating panic.
11. Such pronouncement by Auditor General, with media hype, will disturb Lenders to the Government and even shake the confidence of Depositors of State Banks and adversely affect Foreign Direct Investments, which he should know.
12. Also the Auditor General had made such public pronouncement particularly at a time of an Election, which may be interpreted as a violation of Election Laws by a high ranking public servant.
13. The Auditor General is also a Member of the Council of the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka, who have failed to take any disciplinary action against miscreant Auditors in instances of complicit frauds, as had been pronounced upon by the Supreme Court.
I understand that a political party has reported the AG to the Commissioner of Elections for using this press conference to ridicule earlier Finance Ministers of the country in order to obtain narrow political mileage. I also am aware that a complaint has been lodged with the Institute of Chartered Accountants in respect of the conduct of the AG.

Bangladesh vows improved cricket pitches after ICC rebuke
DHAKA, Thursday: Bangladesh's cricket board Thursday promised to improve pitches for international Tests after its two best venues were rated "below average" by the sport's governing body following the Sri Lanka series.
The International Cricket Council penalised the Sher-e-Bangla National Stadium in Dhaka for its subpar pitch a week after rebuking Bangladesh's other top venue in Chittagong for its shoddy ground.
The latest Test against Sri Lanka ended inside three days, with the visitors thrashing Bangladesh by 215 runs in a match that saw both sides all-out twice in less than eight sessions.
The Chittagong Test, however, saw batsmen plunder more than 1,500 runs, with Sri Lanka declaring at a colossal 713 for nine in their first and only innings.
ICC match referee David Boon -- who issued a demerit point to both venues for below-average pitches -- said the Dhaka ground was poor from day one.
"There was evidence of the ball breaking the pitch surface, which resulted in uneven bounce throughout the match, along with inconsistent turn, which was even excessive at times," he said in a statement.
"This pitch produced a contest that was too heavily skewed in favour of the bowlers, and didn't give the batsmen a fair chance to display their skills."
The opposite problem prevailed in Chittagong last week, when Boon said the pitch provided no seam movement and favoured batsmen, who smashed five centuries and six half-centuries over five days.
The Bangladesh Cricket Board said it would consider appealing the demerit points but promised to take more precautions in future.
"Since we received this rating, we will be more careful about preparing the venues," said the board's chief executive officer Nizamuddin Chowdhury.
Any ground that receives five demerits from the ICC over five years is suspended from hosting international cricket for a year.  AFP

BBS denies SLPP statement based on false reports on social media
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera yesterday condemned the new release issued by SLPP leader Prof. G.L. Peiris, based on false reports that the Bodu Bala Sena organization would continue its anti-Muslim programmes after the SLPP victory.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo, yesterday, Ven. Thera said the BBS had not issued any such statement to the media.
He said that the BBS had not inserted any advertisement or news release on the internet thanking the voters for the SLPP victory and also saying that BBS would continue the anti-Muslim campaign. The BBS has no involvement in such news published on a website.
We all know that there are a number of fake news stories getting more popular on social media and there is no method to control them. Prof. Peiris should have carefully examined whether this news is fake or not before issuing the statement. We have asked the Police to investigate the incident to get to know the persons behind those false notices aimed at tarnishing the image of the BBS, Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera said.
The BBS has never engaged in party politics and campaigning at any election.
The BBS has no intention to start a conflict with any party. The country is now in a state of anarchy. MPs are now being traded to form a new government, while most of politicians are reluctant to give up their posts. We must have a lot of patience to deal with this situation, while acting very carefully, because this kind of situation has not been experienced previously in Sri Lanka. We must also be vigilant on international influences at this juncture, he added.
However, we are happy that SLPP as a new political party obtained a majority with the support of various segments of society. This has clearly shown the popularity of the former President, he said.
We have explained our position on the Muslim issue to all ruling leaders in the power previously. But, nothing has happened so far and no proper solution given to the issue yet. We urge the government to establish Independent Commissions to resolve the problem and finding the actual part of the reconciliation. We were unfairly targeted for this issue previously, but intelligence agencies have cleared us of any wrong doing. Is Prof. Peiris trying to put us in jail again by raising unnecessary issues he queried.

Blueprint for savagery
This year S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia will be commemorating the completion of 100 years of the College at Mount Lavinia. To mark this historic milestone the Drama Society of S. Thomas College will be staging Lord of the Flies, a story about a group of boys stranded on a deserted island and the events that transpire in the absence of rules.Dramatic Moves speaks to the cast members of this classic that speaks of the beast within. Pictures by Sarath Peiris
Teacher in Charge, Michelle Herft, feels that the boys are mature enough to handle this masterpiece of literature.
I think this is a great opportunity for us to do something of this caliber for the 100 years celebration because it is a celebration of great magnitude. As the Teacher in Charge these boys make my job very easy. Lord of the Flies is a novel that is taught in many schools. It is a classic and the cast is doing a fabulous job. I am very proud of them. They are dedicated and have all the requirements to make this a success, said Herft.
Herft pointed out that the play portrays a state of anarchy where the boys switch from a state of being civilized to that of savagery. I have been working with them for a long time, so as a teacher I have watched them grow and blossom. It is a pleasure to see them come this far. I like this drama because it talks about a lot of things that we can relate to. If we are in a state of no rules, think how easy it would be for us to become uncivilized. They are adolescents. So they find it very easy to fall into that savage mode. We see what happens in the play when the boys divide into two factions. This is a part of the production that I like, seeing the unity and the interaction, the boys helping each other and exhibiting their abilities, explained Herft.
Sebastian Sansoni, emphasized on how monumental this play really is because they are doing it for the college that they love and that has given them so much.
Since January last year, the college has organized a series of events to commemorate 100 years at Mount. The English Drama Society is one of the schools oldest societies. So it was decided that we would stage a production in connection with the 100 years celebration. So we are staging an adaptation of William Goldings Lord of the Flies. It focuses on what children might do when they are separated from their parents and how it is in our nature to be a bit violent and savage.
The play will be stage at the Lionel Wendt on February 23, 24 and 25. I am playing the role of Ralph who is the protagonist. He is more inclined not to use violence and being savage. But even he is torn apart by the savagery around him which the boys begin to express, said Sansoni.
In the narration the boys are stranded on an island after their plane crashed. They get to know each other and try to figure out what they need to do.
My character Ralph wants to get rescued and wants to get organized. As the play goes on the group divides into two factions. Ralphs faction and Jack Merridews faction. Jacks group is more interested in hunting pigs and being a little savage. The boys try to protect themselves and get organized in an uncivilized way. The age range of these children is 6 to 13. It is a challenge since I have to play an age which is now alien to me. I am more familiar with myself as an adult. So I have to focus on what it means to be 12. It is also an extremely physical demanding play, explained Sansoni.
Anuk Dharmasena, who plays the character of Jack Merridew, said it is a very special time for him, because he gets to literally be a part of history celebrating the 100 years.
Jack falls into the category of the older children and he is roughly 13 years old. He is the primary antagonist of the play. He represents all those power hungry people in society and we see his characteristics in people like Stalin and Hitler. It is quite challenging playing his character because from the start he is power hungry and wants to be the leader. As the story progresses he becomes more savage, said Dharmasena.
The character of Merridew is one that uses fear to control the rest of the group. At one stage in the play he is a complete tyrant. The story is how these children want to live in a civilized and decent manner but ultimately fail and descend into savagery. The reason why Golding uses this age group is because they are in that transitional phase  they are between two stages. One where society has inculcated in them values of being civilized and then the other stage where they can go savage. Golding attempts to say that evil is inherently in us and being decent is what society attempts to create in you. Jack is not someone you cannot relate to at all, he explained.
Anoushka Weerackckody said Not a lot of people get to celebrate 100 years. So this is a once in a lifetime opportunity being a part of this cast. One thing that we have all realized as a cast is that it is a very physically demanding play. We also have to act as children. So as 18 year olds we need to bring our acting to another level  acting as 11 or 12 year olds. I play Sam, Erics twin. When it comes to team chemistry, every time that S.T.C. does a drama, the team chemistry is really good. Some of us have acted with each other before. In the days to come this is going to be vital, if we are going to put together a good production.
Keiron Ranatunga, says he feels honoured to be a part of this production and feels thrilled he has got the chance to be a part of the 100 year celebration at Mount. The character I play is Percival who is six years old. This production means a lot to us because S.T.C has really impacted our lives. For us to be chosen to be a part of all of this cannot be expressed through words. I think this play we are doing is really brilliant. We have a big responsibility, because we need to bring the childish part of us out to make our acting seem convincing, said Ranatunga.
Actor Viyaan Fernando is playing his first male role.I too feel that we need to portray the transformation to savagery. If it was any other group of boys the outcome would be the same because of the circumstances. My character is a normal kid who becomes a hunter, said Fernando.
Tharuka Jayaratnam, pointed out that the entire school community is coming together this year and this drama is a part of it.
Being a part of this production is very interesting and challenging. My character is Eric. I have never played a kid before. This is the first time I am playing something remote like this. It is so different from other plays because it speaks of the innate evil that comes out when there are no rules basically, said Jayaratnam.
Randev Jayasinha, said from day one, practices have been going really well and the cast have become more like a family.
I play the character of Simon. He is very timid and even though he knows a lot, he is hesitant to come out and tell people what he really knows. He represents the people in our world who know how the world works but is afraid to challenge the people who run it. He does not interfere in everyones business. In doing this complicated role I have received insight into how the human mind works, said Jayasinha
Shilendra Hewawasan, said that kids tend to have a strong reaction to violence which affects their personality.
As I keep practicing I keep on adapting to my character. We, the cast are like a family and we bond together. We also see chaos resulting from a lack of rules, pointed out Hewawasan.
Akhil Ismail, said what he will take out of this play is the skills of cooperation, patience and independence.
I play the role of Piggy and I am confident in this role. He does not change throughout the play. He is nice and smart but easily affected by others. He plays the role that symbolizes innocence. The play speaks about how humans change when left alone without supervision, said Ismail.
Shokeidh Billimoria, plays the darkest character of the play Roger. He is more savage than Jack Merridew and even Jack is unnerved by Rogers darkness.
The goal of the play is to show how they survive. Portraying the feeling of fear is not easy since in real life we are friends but as characters in the play we need to portray that fear of each other. It is also difficult for us to snap out of our characters, said Billimoria.
Anish De Silva, said the message the play gives is that in all of us there is a sense of discipline that comes from the law and order that surrounds us.
But we all have an animal like nature which comes out when there are no rules.
We are doing this for the school, so it is a little emotional.
It comes out when we are practicing. This play is in a way historically significant because we are celebrating an institution that has given us so much, said De Silva.
Linal Fernando, felt at times his character almost takes over his personality. Our Drama group is very resilient and we trust each other. So in order for this play to succeed we need to grow stronger as a unit.
A world without rules seems idyllic. But as we see it takes a turn to the worst in the play.
My character Henry becomes one of the biggest savages in the whole drama, said Fernando.
Movin Jayasinha said that in the short time they have they are making a lot of progress. 
I feel it is easier for an actor to play older roles than younger roles. But we are all giving it our best.
All of us are very talented and I feel so lucky to have been selected to S.T.C. We are definitely going to put on a great show for our school, said Jayasinha.
SandheepTissaratchchy said William Golding shows a dark side of children but a side that is definitely in all.
It takes a dramatic situation to bring that out. When we are young we are impulsive, said Tissaratchchy.
Anish De Chickera, felt that the majority of humans if given the opportunity would be evil if it benefits them.I think Golding wrote this book to prove a point that we cannot survive without rules. I feel that the circumstances/ environment play a big part here. The children have had a horrible experience and they dont know how their parents are. All these contribute to them becoming savages, said De Chickera.
Dhanukh Fernando commented that the play has a lot to do with the power of adaptation.
They start to make their own choices and as the play progresses we see the consequences of those choices. Since we are boys, it is easy for us because we know how to be boys. It is easy for us to get into character and come to our conclusions. But even Maurices character changes and he becomes savage, said Fernando.

Bottled water sold with unidentified particles
Mawanella Hemmathagama people found drinking water bottles with unidentified particles in the water.
The drinking water bottles have been produced on November 02, 2017 in a Kegalle factory with instructions that water bottles are suitable to be used for consumption up to one year. The expiry dates on the bottle also mention the same date.
According to the information received, some other water bottles identical to these with same expiry dates and pieces inside the water contaminating it were discovered in other Kegalle shops and Daily News contacted the Manager of the company, Vimal Perera to inquire about this situation.
The manager said, that they are committed in working towards giving good products for the people.
He said, "we also take this product through a a health care system check up before releasing to the market. There are no poisonous chemicals in our water bottles. But we are producing water bottles which suit the health of the people through a natural method but at some point there is some problem with some bottled water bottles. Therefore, we will correct it promptly".
However, these bottles are already sold in almost every town in Kegalle, where this same company is selling these water bottles to houses and to shops. But the public points out that those responsible for this pollution should be taken into consideration as it is already three months since the product has been manufactured.

Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale presented the proposal to amend the Code of Criminal Procedure Act No 15 of 1979 (Consequential amendment to increasing the minimum age of criminal responsibility).
Cabinet papers to amend the penal code to increase the minimum age of criminal responsibility had also been presented on May 12 and October 14, 2017.
The proposal, the minister had pointed out, also has the effect of relieving a child even between the ages of 12 and 14, who has not attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequence of his conduct of criminal responsibility.
The bill will also confer discretion on a magistrate to determine whether such child has the required degree of cognitive maturity to form the requisite intent or to entertain requisite knowledge which serves as the main criteria of the impugned offense committed by the relevant child.
In order to assist the magistrate to make this determination, it would be necessary to subject the child to an appropriate form of psychological assessment by a government medical officer or other expert in the relevant field.
Further on June 7, 2016, an amendment to the criminal procedure code was brought and instructions given to the legal draftsman to draft legislation to enable such child to be subjected to an examination by a government medical officer to determine whether the child has attained sufficient maturity of understanding to judge the nature and consequence of his conduct on the occasion of his committing the alleged offence and whether the child is in need of therapeutic intervention.

Cabinet reshuffle decision today - Minister
As discussions between the two main parties within the unity government intensify, co-cabinet spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratne yesterday said that a decision on a cabinet reshuffle would be taken today (16).
Addressing the weekly cabinet media briefing yesterday (15), he said the two main constituents of the government had decided to go ahead with the 2015 mandate of the unity government while agreeing to a cabinet reshuffle.
The current crisis was triggered in the aftermath of last weeks local government elections which saw the UNP only securing 33 percent of the vote and the SLFP together with the UPFA 13 percent of the overall vote.
Questions of whether the Prime Minister would resign were also quelled by Minister Senaratne,
We have also decided to go ahead with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. Even Mahinda Rajapaksa had called him and said you should not resign because you were not the one who scored the least, he said.
"We cannot change the Prime Minister now because that will take another six months and we will lose important time the government can use to develop the country, he said.
This week only the two co-cabinet spokespersons; Minister Senaratne and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake were present and Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera had informed them that he would not be able to make it to the meeting due to prior commitments.
The two UNP ministers observed that the election results had caused the government as well as the UNP to reflect hard on their journey thus far and they assured that quick action would be taken to reform their current practices,
We take this result with great humility. We admit that there were problems in our government; we were not able to give the Samurdhi in time or distribute fertilizer to those who need it. We have a few more years to go, so we will bring about quick reforms,Minister Karunathilake said.
He noted that reforms within the UNP as well as the UNF would be taken.
Our government was weak in prosecuting criminals and taking action against corruption, especially of the previous regime, added Minister Senaratne and assured that from now on, steps would be taken to rectify issues in law and order. He added that action would also be taken to change the Sri Lankan Airline board and have an independent committee to appoint a new board to run the struggling carrier.
The most significant factor contributing to the two main parties faring poorly in the election, he said was that many within the government had started criticizing it, The attacks were felt more deeply because it came from inside, said the minister.
He stressed that negotiations had been held with both the President and Prime Minister with this regard and they had decided to move ahead with more discipline in future.
Answering questions of whether the SLFP or UNP were still looking at going it alone, Minister Senaratne explained that the UNP had a greater chance of mustering the numbers than the SLFP but they had decided to go ahead with the unity government, A government can now only be formed if the two come together, he said.
As Minister Senaratne stressed for unity, he explained that the government at present should focus on the two most important things:
Firstly we need to properly explain this election defeat to the people as we still have our 2015 mandate, and we can only go forward from here, we cannot reverse that. Secondly we need the UNP and SLFP to come together to claim the majority in the maximum number of local governments, I believe we can do that for at least 185 councils.
If we forget this and squabble over other things, only Mahinda Rajapaksa will benefit, he said.

Calculating the peoples verdict
Local government elections are over. People have given their verdict. Hence, it would be quite appropriate to reflect upon what happened and its possible consequences.
It was a unique election for several reasons. First and foremost, it was the maiden election under a new electoral system. Overall, it was successful. It is more democratic than the infamous preferential of the manape voting system, which was a breeding ground for corruption and violence. The introduction of the Ward system of representation engendered much enthusiasm among the voters that an unprecedented voter participation was recorded.
The Election Commission, empowered by the 19th Amendment to the Constitution did a wonderful job with police assistance in strictly and impartially enforcing election law. There was no government interference in their work. That is why the election was the most peaceful one held in several decades. Of course, there were few minor incidents of breach of the law. However, considering a large number of candidates that contested and their political diversity it is insignificant. There were no murders, no abductions, and no fatal injuries. One could safely conclude that the democratic consciousness of the people have matured and the beginning has been laid for a new and higher political culture.
The most illuminating factor in the elections was, however, the peoples verdict. Whatever said and done it showed where actual sovereignty lies. In a rare moment, people once again demonstrated that they are supreme. (Experience shows that such moments do not last long!)
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Pakshaya (SLPP)
Sri Lanka Podu Jana Pakshaya (SLPP) emerged the clear winner grabbing a majority representation in 239 of 340 Councils. It is a record for a newly formed party.
What are the reasons for this landslide victory
Though a local government election, the campaigns of all contesting parties ensured that it took a national dimension. Local government issues were kept out of the campaign and instead, the election was converted into a sort of referendum on the performance of the Government. It was further reduced to the level of a three-cornered contest between the President, Prime Minister and the former President  all of them personally taking charge of the campaign.
In addition, the contest was focused on the Sinhala Buddhist vote base and nothing much was done to attract the voters belonging to the other national communities. The former President told the media after the victory of the SLPP that it was able to even to reduce Eelam, meaning the election of a mere handful of its representatives in predominantly Tamil majority polling areas in the North. Such an assertion implies that according to him the country is already bifurcated into Sri Lanka and Tamil Eelam. This is in line with his ludicrous claim that the Government has sold the country to please the separatist Diaspora according to an international conspiracy.
Sowing dissension among ones opponents is a long-time practice among Sri Lankan politicians. Former President was a master at it. This practice continued even under the present Government. Prime Minister Wickremesinghes strategy was to keep the SLFP division permanent while former President Rajapaksas main strategy was to create dissension within the Government and promote acrimony between the SLFP and the UNP. President Sirisena engaged himself in a bitter war of words and some unfriendly acts towards his ruling coalition partner UNP as if to compete with his predecessor in office.
Prime Ministers strategy of dividing the SLFP boomeranged and the Government got divided as a result. Its inevitable result was the consolidation of the former President and his party-SLPP. The peoples electoral verdict is its result. It is that simple. The old mantram United you in, divided you fail held sway.
Had the Government parties gone to the polls with a monolithic unity the result would have been probably the exact opposite.
The SLPP victory is more due to the weakness, inefficiency and divisions within the Government than to the competence of the SLPP or the popularity of its leader. Whatever progress there was initially had halted thereafter.
SAITM degrees
Both the President and the Prime Minister were engaged in a power struggle with an eye on a distant election in 2020 instead of implementing the promised reforms. President Sirisenas time and efforts were spent on the impossible task of keeping the SLFP intact in spite of organised attempts and action by the former President to form a rival political organisation. He has now successfully done so and in the process virtually killed the SLFP and ruined its future.
The Government resorted to repressive measures to curtail mass agitation. For example, the striking petroleum workers were assaulted brutally by hired thugs and the Government has so far been unable to punish or even identify anyone. A simple issue such as the question of SAITM degrees was left unresolved for nearly a year. Even up to date a final solution has not been made with the Government intransigently holding on to its own PPP solution despite the concurrence of all parties to the dispute with the solution given by the Medical Faculty teachers and the GMOA. The Audit Commission, Charter of Ethics for MPS, anti-corruption programme and the much-promised reform are yet to see the light of day.
Interpretations of the election results are many and varied. Statistics have been employed to suit this or that hypothesis. Some remind us of Mark Twains famous saying that there are three kinds of lies- lies, damn lies and statistics.
Sometimes statistics should be read backwards to gauge the hidden truth. The basis of the conclusion about the popularity of the former President Rajapaksa is the number of votes received by the SLPP. It is rational to conclude so. However, there is another truth. He received 44.7 percent of the total polled votes. Reading backwards it would mean that there was 52.3 percent against him. That which is greater is obvious. Besides, unlike in a Referendum or a Presidential election, personal votes obtained by considerations other than political by individual local government candidates are also included in that count.
Only one thing is very clear. It is the great decline in the UNP vote base. In August 2015 it stood at its peak reaching 45.7 percent. This time it is only 32.6 percent - a grand slide down of 13.3 percent.
The President throughout the election campaign told the voters that the candidates of the SLFP/UPFA are his own (my!) candidates and they should be elected. Yet the SLFP received only 4.4 percent of the total vote, even below that of the JVP. Even when the votes received by the UPFA (8.9 percent) are added the total number of voters that answered the call of the President was 13.3 percent. It is to be recalled that the number of votes he received at the Presidential election from the Southern Sinhala Buddhist vote base, excluding UNP sympathizers and members were not much different. Hence, the quantum of erosion, if any, of his vote base, is not certain as that of the UNP.
Local government bodies
Taken individually, figures stand out prominently. It is only in comparisons they stand in bold relief. The victory of the SLPP shines in all its glory only in comparison with the defeat of the Government parties.
On the other hand, compared with the Presidential election results of 2015 the popularity of the former President Rajapaksa has not risen at all.
He received only 44.6 percent whereas in 2015 it was 47.6 percent. The future will depend on whether the ruling combine forges unity, correct its mistakes take the people into confidence shedding its intransigence and arrogance and implement the January 8th programme of action or proceed along the same lethargic and somewhat anti-people policies as it did during the three years.
Though the SLPP won marketing the image of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa that image cannot contribute anything to actual governance of local government bodies. It has no programme for local government development. Its election theme of saving the country from betrayal has also nothing to do with local council governance. Hence, it will have to train its councillors to govern.
The presence of a fair number of experienced former Councillors is not a blessing but a burden on account of their tarnished character.
Election results also indicate a decline in both tradition dominant parties  the UNP and the SLFP. SLPP seems to replace both. If one concludes that both the UNP and the SLFP would be replaced in the not too distant future by new political formations, it may not be inaccurate. Already the SLFP is being replaced.
The less than expected performance of the JVP shows clearly that it has a long way to go to become a viable Third Force, leave alone forming a government of its own. Only a united Left would be able to become a Third Force.
The JVP could contribute significantly to make that possibility a reality. However, a pre-condition for such an eventuality is the elimination of the eternal animosity between the Old Left and the New Left. Such unity has to be sought among actually existing Left parties and groups and not with some ideal parties with perfect theories. There are none without sin among all of them.
Some blame the voters for the election result without trying to understand why they behaved so. Let me quote a well-known saying of Lenin; People always have been the foolish victims of deception and self-deception in politics and they always will be, until they have learnt to seek out the interests of some class or other behind all moral, religious, political and social phrases, declarations and promises.

Captain wanted in gang rape case of nurse arrested
The Captain of the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police, wanted in connection with the gang rape incident involving a nurse of a private hospital, was arrested on Wednesday by Narahenpita Police.
The suspect, J. M. A. K. Jayawardena, was attached to the Sri Lanka Corps of Military Police camp in Thaladi, Mannar. He was produced before the Aluthkade No. 03 Magistrates Court yesterday.
Previously, several persons, including the lover of the nurse who was raped multiple times, a 37-year-old Captain (Doctor) of the Army Medical Corps, the driver Lance Corporal, and an engineer from Moratuwa were arrested on February 11 in connection with this incident.
They were produced in court and remanded until February 16. The incident was reported to Narahenpita Police on February 6. It is reported that the suspect arrested yesterday had joined the Army in 2009 and had been highly addicted to cannabis.
Narahenpita Police had notified him, through the Army Headquarters to report to the police station, and had arrested him there.
It is also learnt that the police had found an instrument used to inhale cannabis, an artificial sex object and commercial drugs, during their search of his room.
Meanwhile, the Army doctor who was attached to the Army hospital in Narahenpita, had been involved with the nurse, who he had met while engaging in private practice at the private hospital she was working.
The said army doctor is a married man and father of two, but had hidden this information from her and pretended to be single.
He had also promised to marry her. However, he had gone overseas on a scholarship and during his absence, the nurse had learnt of his real details and his marriage.
Having heard of his marriage and children, she had decided to end the relationship and had even rejected his calls thereafter.
The doctor had subsequently returned to the country on vacation and had gone looking for her to the hospital and had promised her that he would leave his wife and marry her.
Later, he had convinced her to go out with him and had taken her to a lonely house in the Nittambuwa area. He had forced her to consume liquor, smoke cannabis and had raped her.
The army doctor had then allowed his driver, the Lance Corporal to rape her as well and recorded the incident on his phone.
He had then threatened the nurse and said he would kill her and burn her if she revealed anything that had taken place that day to anyone.
On another day, he had taken her to a house belonging to an engineer and in the same manner drugged her and raped her and subsequently allowed the engineer and two other lance corporals to rape her as well and he had videoed the rape.
Later, he had emailed the nude photographs of the nurse to the hospital email. The nurse had then complained to the police.
Acting on the complaint, the police had commenced investigations and arrested the army doctor and the two drivers. Upon inspecting the residence of the doctor, police had found two mobile phones that contained the video footage of the rape. The nurse had been subjected to a medical examination to confirm that she had been severely sexually abused.
Further investigations are currently underway.
Meanwhile, speaking to the Daily News, Military Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu said the army would cooperate with the police in their investigations. However, he said a military inquiry was also underway regarding this incident.
He noted that as the police investigations had warranted the arrest of the army doctor and corporal, they stand temporarily interdicted from the army.
However, he said the military investigation will determine the future action required to be taken with regard to the military personnel.

CBSL to maintain policy rates at present levels
Considering the recent developments in the domestic and international macroeconomic environment, the Monetary Board, at its meeting held on February 14, 2018, was of the view that the current monetary policy stance was appropriate and decided to maintain the policy interest rates of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka at their present levels.
The decision of the Monetary Board is consistent with the objective of maintaining inflation at mid-single digit levels over the medium term and thereby facilitating a sustainable growth trajectory. The rationale underpinning the monetary policy stance is set out below.
Policies adopted by the Central Bank(CBSL) and the government have helped stabilise the economy. By end 2017, both the growth of broad money supply and the growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks have moderated to desired levels.
In the external sector, export earnings reached an all-time high of around US dollars 11.4 billion in 2017, largely supported by the sustained increase in export earnings stemming from the restoration of the GSP+ facility by the European Union, favourable prices for key commodities in the international market and the flexible exchange rate policy maintained by the Central Bank.
However, drought related imports and increased gold imports caused an expansion in the trade deficit. Positive momentum in services exports, including the tourism sector, also continued while there was a moderation in workers remittances.
Direct investment inflows have also increased considerably in 2017, partly due to the receipt of divestment proceeds from the lease of the Hambantota port. Reflecting these developments, gross official reserves stood at US dollars 7.7 billion at end January 2018, while the rupee depreciated by 0.9 per cent against the US dollar so far during 2018.
With regard to the global economy, the International Monetary Fund revised its global growth projections upwards in its update to the World Economic Outlook issued in January 2018. While it is anticipated that this improved global growth momentum will have an overall positive effect on the Sri Lankan economy, tighter global financial conditions remain a concern.
Considering these developments, the Monetary Board decided to maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) of the Central Bank at their current levels of 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively.

Creating a mindful society
Sati Pasala (Mindful School) was initiated back in March 2016, by a dedicated Buddhist monk in the strict forest tradition, Ven. Udairiyagama Dhammajiva Thero.
The prime motive of the initiative is to take mindfulness to school children in a non-sectarian, non-religious manner.
It promotes mindfulness or "Sati" as a valuable human skill as opposed to a religious norm. So far the programmes conducted by Sati Pasala has received commendable acceptance from schools of all ethnic and religious backgrounds and from the Parliament itself.
Sati Pasala has taken bold steps to take mindfulness to Parliament as well.
President Maithripala Sirisena has shown great interest of the project and a mindfulness programme will be held to the Members of the Parliament, soon.
Global Mindfulness Summit 2018
To show case the unique approach and the success story, Sati Pasala has organized `Global Mindfulness Summit 2018 which will be inaugurated by the President Maithripala Sirisena on February 23.
The summit will have two days of panel discussions and will feature three interesting pre events.
r Mindfulness Effective strategies to deal with Drug, Tobacco and Alcohol use. (February 17)
Experts will discuss the value of mindfulness in socially relevant and critical issues. Special emphasis will be on using mindfulness as a preventive tool rather than as a therapeutic intervention from destructive habits such as alcohol, drugs and tobacco use.
Destructive habits leading to harmful addictions connected specifically to alcohol, drugs and tobacco are taking a serious toll on young peoples lives. Conventional remedies and legislative interventions have had limited impact. Mindfulness which enables training and mastery of the mind, allowing self-control, could help to resist temptations. Mindfulness may prevent habit formation to addictive substances so that young and vulnerable people may not become victims to these trends.
Dr. Nishan de Mel (Director Verit Research), Dr. Sajeewa Ranaweera (SLMA Expert Committee on Alcohol and Tobacco) and Prof. Diyanath Samarasinghe will share their extensive experiences and understanding on the subject at this pre-event, held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute. In addition, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister, Dr. Rajitha Senaratne, will be a special speaker at the event.
The Founder of the Sati Pasala Foundation, Ven. Dhammajiva Maha Thero will bring into focus the value of mindfulness and its preventive role in addressing this grave social concern. He will also lead a guided Mindful Sitting Meditation.
r Integrating yoga exercise with mindfulness meditation (February 21)
r Protecting our nature through mindfulness: an Interfaith Dialogue (February 22)
The summit will be addressed by respected spiritual leaders from many religious backgrounds and eminent academics from around the world and it will have a participation of over 600 delegates. Several donor/partner contributions are supporting the Sati Pasala Foundation in this effort and all proceedings are totally free of charge.

Crocodile in  Balapitiya seas captured
A crocodile that posed a great threat to the lives of residents in Balapitiya and Ambalangoda for over a month was captured by fisher-folk and guest house owners on Tuesday morning.
The crocodile had gone to the sea from the Maadampa River on last December from the Hirewatta estuary. It has captured several stray dogs last month, residents said.
A foreigner escaped narrowly from it while he was sea bathing. A swimming competition scheduled to be held in the sea waters near Ambalangoda on January 18 was cancelled in fear of the crocodile, they said.
The residents in Ambalangoda and Balapitiya had informed about the crocodile to the Wildlife Office in Hikkadwa, but they have not taken any action. Therefore, bay watch officers and residents had captured it with a fishing net.
Ahungalla Police had handed over the crocodile to the Hikkaduwa Wildlife Office.
