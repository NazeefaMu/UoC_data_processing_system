Lie-In protest outside White House
US: A group of teens and more than a hundred supporters staged a lie-in outside the White House on Presidents Day to pressurise lawmakers to pass tougher gun laws, the media reported.
The group, dubbed Teens for Gun Reform, had started organising the event by seeking 17 demonstrators to lie down for three minutes to symbolise how long it took for Nikolas Cruz to gun down 17 students and teachers at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Florida last week, reports CNN.
The two of us have organised this protest in solidarity with all of those who were affected by the tragic school shooting in Florida last week, Eleanor Nuechterlein and Whitney Bowen, the teen organisers, said in a statement on Monday.
We call on our national and state legislatures to finally act responsibly and reduce the number of these tragic incidents. Its essential that we all feel safe in our classrooms.
Initially, they hoped to have 17 of their closest friends attend the demonstration. But word of the event spread on social media, and it ultimately drew more than a hundred supporters.
Representative Don Beyer, a Virginia Democrat and a proponent of gun control, was among those who attended the event, reports CNN.
I was very proud of them, Mr Beyer said. The ground was cold and wet.
This is a holiday. But, yeah, theyre being politically active.
Historically, its the old people that participate in the elections and do all the volunteering, so this was great... And hopefully it portends a sea change in our attitude toward gun safety legislation.
Mondays protest came amid a wave of impassioned calls for gun reform, many of them led by young people.

Spiritual, educational development, a must for prosperity
Spiritual and educational development among younger generations is a must for a country to prosper, Southern Provincial Education Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
Most students in the Southern Province have been capable of achieving excellent results at examinations, the minister added.
He was addressing a ceremony held at the Sri Rathajothi Maha Vidyalaya in Kamburupitiya as the chief invitee.
It is hardly possible to run a school while satisfying every politician and parent. There is an excess of teachers at some schools, while others in remote areas lack them. In spite of all these obstacles, teachers and students make genuine efforts to bring honour to the Southern Province, the minister said.
Minister Rasaputhra said a recent survey carried out in the South revealed that the lack of a proper and healthy atmosphere for children to carry out their studies due to negligence, poverty, and family feuds lead to the decline in examination results of some children.
The Southern Provincial Council (SPC) Education Ministry is currently searching for solutions to these issues. Steps would be taken to admit such affected children to childrens homes and provide them proper education. Advanced countries in the world have adopted these strategies, he added.
He said children are an asset to the country. Providing them with financial allocations would be an invaluable investment and added that affording a sound education to every child in the Southern region would be the aim of his ministry.
In the national educational development process, Engineering Technology studies have been prioritised. Proper facilities have to be provided for students following these subjects, Minister Chandima Rasaputhra said.
Plans are afoot to further boost the examination results of all students in state schools in the Southern Province. Measures to enhance human resources in affected schools in the Southern are also underway, he said.
Several others also addressed the meeting.

## Title: The gift I have to give is my foolishness

The gift I have to give is my foolishness
I know him. Do you If you were young in the 1970s Im sure you read him once long ago. If you grew up reading the books your parents collected when they were young, you too would know him. If you happen to be a descendant of a generation of bookworms Im certain that somewhere in your house there is a book he has written. Then again, if neither of these things apply to you, I am sure you would still have read one of his quotes on the wall at the waiting area at the dentist, at the entrance to the public library or in a farewell card you bought for a friend.
He is Richard Bach. The little guy who made Bach a household name with roughly 36,000,000 copies circulating all over the world is Jonathan Livingston Seagull.
Described as tall, unassuming, friendly and approachable by those who have interviewed him, Richard David Bach, a native of Long Beach, Calif.,USA, has always described himself as a creature of the sky. He sees flying as that primal wish in all of us not to be tied by gravity,to be that curious soul above it all.
Bach says he was a struggling aviation-writer when a voice spoke to him, saying the name Jonathan Livingston Seagull. Inspired by the voice and two subsequent cinematic visions that occurred years apart, he eventually finished a 30-page novella about a seagull who goes off on his own and dedicates his life to flying artfully rather than just pragmatically. The feathery parable of Jonathan Livingston Seagull, soon became one of the top-grossing novels ever written.
Yet, like for most other writers success didnt come easy. In a world where everyone was expected to fit into the same kind of peg as everyone else, the kind of landscapes Bach created deluded classification. In fact, any kind of boundary seems antithetical to his ideas. As one critic described him, He was frequently a main character in his fiction. His fiction was not necessarily fiction. No wonder a lot of publishers rejected him. I made a game out of collecting rejection slips. When I sent a manuscript out, I needed a rejection slip to expand my collection. Most often Id get one. Once in a while Id get a little thing that said, We want to buy it. Id feel almost disappointed. Bach recalls in a recent interview. Then he adds Everyone has to come to terms with this somehow, by sheer persistence; you have to find someone to publish your book.
Heres how it worked for Bach. One day in 1969, Eleanor Friede, an editor at Macmillan, agreed to look at the much-rejected, novella about Jonathan. She was charmed by his wish to seek freedom. I think it has a chance of growing into a long-lasting standard book for readers of all ages, she wrote in a memo to her senior editors.
It was a good hunch. Jonathan Livingston Seagull, for which Bach received a $2,000 advance, became one of the biggest successes in publishing history. After Jonathan, the world said thanks by giving me a lot of money, Bach says now. That didnt mean I was prepared for it. When seagull mania took over the whole world, Bach not only became suddenly rich but he found he was also single again. He and his wife of 13 years, Bette, with whom hed had six children, had divorced in 1970. Never well grounded in finance, he invested his windfall several million dollars, with a trusted flying buddy and ended up bankrupt. By 1981 in order to pay $1 million as back taxes he had to relinquish his rights to royalties from his books to the government.
It was during this time that he became reacquainted with Leslie Parrish, a former actress and fledgling producer he had met in 1972 while a film version of Jonathan Livingston Seagull was being made. They both wanted to make a film of of one of his other books, Illusions. That never got off the ground, but a romance did. He married Parrish in 1981.
After they got married, with her help, he managed to rise from the ashes. A year after their marriage, Parrish-Bach, gathered every penny she had, Bach says, and bought back his copyrights. Together they wrote two successful books, The Bridge Across Forever and One, both extolling, he says, life in an intimate relationship. Sadly, they divorced in 1997. He married his third wife, Sabryna Nelson-Alexopoulos, in April 1999.
Bach has also tried to make amends for the past in recent years. He admits that he was an absentee father after his divorce but recently he has reconciled with four of his five surviving children. His son Jonathan,named after the protagonist in the best-seller, has also published a book with the chip-off-the-old-block title of Above the Clouds.
Ask Richard Bach about his writing technique and you will hear the kind of reply only he could give. I dont have any special techniques that other writers dont have; it comes from the idea itself, he explains. Irving Stone, for instance, did enormous amounts of research, just boxes and boxes of index cards and he wrote the most beautiful books from that. I am exactly the opposite; I use almost no notes, no research other than my life. My life is my research, and I obviously draw upon my own experience in my stories, but thats it. I have just a hazy, foggy notion of where this thing might be going. When I was writing Running from Safety I had no idea until something like page 342, who one of the characters was. There was this other person hiding behind the character.
Crazy though this may seem Bach also believes the ironic thing about writing is that its an intellectual pursuit but to get there you have to be stupid. The mantra, according to Bach is to get networked into Dont care. If we think that we must be erudite, intellectual, and must never be seen as foolish, youve really started out on the wrong foot as a writer. Most new writers do just that. It takes a lot of experience to learn that the gift I have to give is my foolishness. Its the craziness of my ideas that make them interesting, make them worthwhile. Once we learn to relax and not to worry about how the reader, the editor, or the publisher thinks of us. Then we can get down to the interesting writing.
There is no doubt that this theory works. How else would Bach have written Jonathan Livingston Seagull  the iconic phenomenal best-seller that speaks to people who follow their hearts and make their own rules...people who get special pleasure out of doing something well, even if only for themselves...people who know theres more to this kind of living than meets the eye.
Yes, thats you. You should be right there with Jonathan, flying higher and faster than you ever dreamed possible.

On Presidents instructions :
All SAITM students to be enrolled to KDU
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday instructed that all current students in the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM ) be enrolled to the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University (KDU) medical faculty.
The decision was arrived at during a special meeting held at the Presidential Secretariat last evening, Presidents Media Unit said in a statement. The Attorney General, the Vice Chancellor and the Dean of the KDU and the Chairman of the University Grants Commission and several other stakeholders participated at the meeting.
During discussions, a decision was taken to enroll around 1000 students currently studying at the SAITM Medical Faculty to the KDU after perusing their basic admission requirements.
Meanwhile, the Presidents official Twitter page stated after deliberating on all options and listening to all stake holders, I instructed that all current SAITM students to be transferred to Kothalawala Defense Universitys Medical Faculty. Earlier, a Special Commission appointed to resolve the SAITM issue recommended the abolition of SAITM in a manner legally acceptable to the current shareholders, lending institutions and the new entity interested in taking over all operations and management of SAITM, via the transferal of all SAITMs assets, liabilities, staff and students to a non-state, not-for-profit degree-awarding entity that complies with the Minimum Standards on Medical Education and Training.
It was stated that the legal process to carry this out will require the creation of two separate entities, both in compliance with the Minimum Standards which was a new not-for-profit sunset institution that will absorb all students who were in SAITMs medical programme, as well its assets and liabilities; at which point SAITM will be abolished. The sunset institution will conclude operations when the last current batches of students graduate. No new students will be admitted to this entity.
The second was a new not-for-profit sunrise institution that will start accepting new students from 2019. On December 30,2017, the Government signed a Memorandum of Understanding with SAITM and the Sri Lanka Institute of Information Technology (SLIIT) tom carry out the above recommendations. However, several stakeholders involved in the SAITM issue later agitated and handed over a letter to the President requesting him to enroll all students currently at the Malabe private medical university to the KDU medical faculty.

## Title: Assistance to Sri Lanka in PPP Initiatives

Assistance to Sri Lanka in PPP Initiatives
With the Public Private Partnership (PPP) being pursued by the Government to streamline the working methodology of the public sector, foreign assistance has come Sri Lankas way in a big way. The public sector enterprises have not been able to produce tangible results due to a number of limiting factors which include the following:
* Absence of good governance measures
* Overstaffing of SOEs and understaffing of public agencies responsible with facilitating PPP initiatives
* Lack of liquid funds
* Non availability of skilled staff and professionals
* Excessive state control and perceived monopolies
* Malpractices which go undetected for a long period of time
* Absence of budgetary controls like those in the private sector
* Inadequate internal control measures
* Lack of vision for short, medium and long term PPP project pipelines
* Inadequate management information systems and IT systems
Due to above and other factors, a majority of public sector enterprises were unable to achieve the required standards in productivity, profitability, liquidity and other long term stability benchmarks.
At the same time an unnecessary fear psychosis was created in the minds of the state sector employees in following areas regarding foreign investment and the implementation of PPPs.
They include:
* Loss of job security
* Loss of financial and other perks which they now enjoy
* Lack of language proficiency
* Inability to come to work at set times under a new management
* Fear of freedom at work
* Demanding work targets and set standards
* Reduction of holidays
* Fear of demotion and transfer
* Inability to pay more attention to the families at times they need
* Inter department rivalries
* The fear of total privatization
Successive governments have failed to restructure inefficient Public Enterprises and the State Treasury was called upon to meet the losses of State Enterprises causing large budget deficits of the country and hampering development or stepping into development through foreign loans. The present debt crisis of the country is mainly due to this drawback.
Time has come now and may never come again to restructure our loss making State Enterprises unless decisive actions are taken.
I had the opportunity to visit the office of STAIR (Short term assistance to improve Public Financial Management Reform), a project funded with USA assistance and efficiently executed by Nathan Associates Inc., by a dedicated team of experts and a skilled team of staff members. They have been conducting many workshops, seminars, strategy planning sessions, video presentations and training sessions and have also prepared work manuals and instructional ideas. Tangible results have been achieved especially in preparing the ground work for public sector procurement reforms in a very fruitful manner. This was revealed by David Baxter who is a PPP specialist and a consultant to the STAIR Project.
The Stair Project commenced its work in Sri Lanka in 2015 and during the last 27 months have rendered yeoman services towards their project success. They have worked towards their objectives, with great commitment and dedication mainly in following areas.
* Specifics of PPP implementation
* Enhancing of public procurement efficiency
* Enhancing of Transparency and competitiveness in Public Procurement Systems
* Streamlining and enhancing of Audit Capacity
* Other core areas such as improving public sector accounting
The Ministries of Finance and Mass Media, Megapolis Development, Industry and Commerce together with the National Procurement Commission and Finance Commission, have been in constant touch with this project as they will be the ultimate beneficiaries from the success of this project. The project was able to identify and train forty Public Servants who have become fully conversant with the entire procurement reform programme. The knowledge and training gained by them will be an asset to the state in training the State Sector employees as Trainers to the entire public sector procurement reform programme.
Baxter himself cited a few challenges in the total implementation of PPP programmes in Sri Lanka. They are:
* Ongoing and incomplete changes in Government policy due to Government reforms
* Limited technical capacities of the Ministries
* Political opposition to PPPs
* Lack of educational opportunities for public servants to acquire a total knowledge on Public Private Partnerships
* Absence of resources of the Ministries, Local Government Authorities, Provincial Councils and State Agencies to train their staff on the guidelines and benefits of PPP and other reform programmes.
* Outsiders (Private individuals/concerns) introducing unsolicited programmes on their own to PPP Projects/Programmes, overjumping the selected/decided programmes for PPP implementation, taking a political face.
Baxter expects the authorities to be aware of above issues. However, he was happy to see the completion of a number of programmes on Training of Trainers.
In addition, it will be of paramount importance to bring in new legislation for the state sector reform programme in a phased manner based on the success of each stage so that there will be very minimum opposition to PPP Programmes from all corners. A fruitful alliance with the blue chip quoted companies in the Colombo bourse will bring in steady results over the years for the PPP programmes in addition to seeking partners through the Board of Investment, Overseas Chambers of Commerce and PPP Organisations abroad also. Donors and Multi-lateral banks also have an important role to fill in the future of PPPs in Sri Lanka.
Existing labour laws also need to come under the purview of the state and suitably amended in consultation with Ministries, Trade Unions, Chambers of Commerce and productivity organizations.
Baxter highlighted the following sectors on a priority basis for PPP initiatives in Sri Lanka.
* Road and rail transport sector
* Power
* Clean drinking water
* Water Taxi/Water transport systems
* Leisure sector
I personally favour the PPP programmes for road transport sector initially as every day we hear of road accidents ,traffic jams, penalties, failed signal lights, passenger abuses by bus crews and fellow passengers, non giving of fare balances by the conductors to the passengers, racing between buses for passengers, air pollution by buses. I also remember the case of privatisation of Regional Transport Boards through the Colombo Stock Exchange in 2003. The deal was cancelled due to the buyer defaulting on payment on due date.
Over dependence on certain countries for PPP programmes is another drawback depriving global investors the opportunity to participate on a meaningful and active PPP programme in a transparent manner. It is important that investors believe that they will enjoy equal status on competitive procurements.
Baxter also stressed the importance of Value for Money concept for all PPP programmes for the benefit of all parties. It should be a win win situation for the state, the investor, staff, general public and other stakeholders. For all PPP programmes, innovation should not be ignored as a key to success and also to promote the programmes.
According to Baxter, the Dutch Government is providing continued assistance to the Government of Sri Lanka, amongst other countries for the success of PPP programmes.
The Millennium Challenge Corporation (MCC) of USA is another institution from whom assistance could be sought for productive PPP programmes in Sri Lanka. The Government of United States listed Sri Lanka in year 2000 as one of the first sixteen countries to receive Millennium Challenge Assistance. However, Sri Lanka could not reap the benefits of this scheme of assistance due to the adverse security situation of the country.
Talking about the specific training programmes of STAIR, the following programme summary would indicate their commitment to the project which was assigned to them.
* In 2017 November they conducted a series of seminars and workshops at JAIC Hilton , Colombo for PPP simulation in collaboration with the Dutch Government. These were well attended by the top officials of the State Sector from different Ministries. The participating officials were awarded certifications and will carry the message of the usefulness of PPP programmes and the Public Enterprise Financial Reforms, for the country and its advantages and the applications.
In addition, the officials of Provincial Councils, Municipal Councils, Urban Councils and other Local Government officials were also trained in addition to the other state sector officials so that they were able to fully understand the benefits, objectives and strategic importance.
The trained officials will create awareness at both National Level and Provincial Level to widen the spectrum and scope for set objectives under the programme.
* In 2017, over 3,000 public officials were trained with emphasis on Empowerment of Women. Over 47% of the participants were females
* In 2016, six hundred Lead Auditors were trained
* In 2016, eight hundred officials were trained on public procurement programmes
* In 2016, thousand two hundred and fifty PPP officials were trained
* In 2015, over four hundred Internal Auditors were trained
It is very vital to continue the efforts of STAIR into a more progressive level. They have carved out an opening for state sector financial reforms in a very constructive and in a visionary manner for the benefit of our country.
Baxter and the Nathan Associates Inc. officials took a leaf out of the success stories and mentioned the success story of PPP in Manila, Philippines where the transport sector benefitted immensely and the Health Sector innovations in India. There are many success stories all over the world.
As we all know, the 19th Amendment to the Constituition of our country provided for the setting up of the National Procurement Commission, (NPC). This area of procurement provides the nucleus of financial stability of most state enterprises. STAIR stepped into this area in a big way and have trained the public officials in prudent procurement practices.
STAIR was also instrumental in compiling a number of manuals and preparing video seminars for the benefit of the state sector. Some of them included:
* Procurement Audit Manual
* Forensic Audit Manual
* Financial Audit Manual
* Performance Audit Manual
* I/T systems Audit Manual
In addition, a new website was also developed for the Auditor Generals Department
The PPP drive gathered momentum globally in the last decade of the 20th century and accelerated in the 21st century. Many countries have benefitted from PPP initiatives to eliminate losses of State Sector Enterprises and lessen the burden on the treasuries of many developing countries. The fear and reluctance for PPP drives in the minds of staff and workers of public enterprises could be easily eliminated with better education and demonstrations with practical examples with figures and global success stories. It will be a new experience for the Public Sector employees especially the loss making Public Enterprises. In fact, a PPP drive is a value addition to a Public Sector Organization, which is in the best interests of such Public Organization with a long term existence vision.
We should have not allowed the public organisations to deteriorate in terms of Finance, Management, Good Governance, Administration, Human Resource and Practices, during the last few decades. The liquid funds spent on the losses of a large number of Public Enterprises in the past could well have been used for the development of the country.
A good example of a successful PPP was the Sri Lanka Telecom. Ultimate beneficiaries are the General Public. In the eighties, the people of this country had to wait for many years to get a telephone connection with problems in the availability of loops and other red tape measures of the management. For the initial public offering, there was a problem of even pricing a share at an attractive value. However, in 2004, the IPO was successfully launched at a price of Rs.15 and today Sri Lanka Telecom has reached a level of substantial market capitalization as a quoted share in the Colombo Bourse. The share price exceeded Rs.50 level on many occasions. The management is in the hands of a public and private partnership with Sri Lanka Telecom collecting much needed liquid funds through the Colombo Stock Exchange and Global Investors
We should offer a big bouquet to the management of STAIR Project and the donors of funds for the project for assisting Sri Lanka in this hour of need and we should sincerely hope that the funding agencies will continue their assistance in fulfilling their vision.

Australia to deport Lankan asylum seeker
A Sri Lankan asylum seeker, who is an LTTE suspect, is to be deported from Australia after the UN Committee against torture had withdrawn a request to halt his removal, the Guardian reported on Wednesday.
Shantaruban, currently held in immigration detention in Melbourne, has been in Australia since arriving by boat in 2012. A notice of intention to remove from Australia has been issued against him for February 22.
Shantarubans claim for refugee status has been rejected. He says he has been unable to properly present his claim for protection because he was initially fearful to declare his association with the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).When Shantaruban later sought to present evidence of his involvement with the LTTE, it was ruled inadmissible because he had not declared it earlier.
Other former members of the LTTE have declared their association and have had their claims to persecution recognised by the Australian government.
In October last year, the UN committee against torture issued an interim measure request, formally asking that Australia refrain from returning Shantaruban to Sri Lanka while his complaint is under consideration.
The UN, several governments and human rights groups have consistently raised serious concerns over the return of Tamil asylum seekers to Sri Lanka, particularly those with known links to the LTTE.
However, Australias permanent mission to the UN in Geneva wrote to the committee this month arguing Shantarubans claims are not substantiated and that it is not necessary to take the interim measures requested.
It said, there were no substantial grounds for believing Shantaruban faces a real risk of irreparable harm if returned to Sri Lanka.
In response, the committee on February 19 wrote to the Australian government, lifting the interim measure and effectively clearing the way for Shantarubans removal from Australia.

Instituting legal proceedings against CA Judge:
BASL files writ petition against BRIBERY DGs action
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday filed a writ petition in the Supreme Court seeking an order quashing the Bribery Commission Director Generals decision to institute legal proceedings against Court of Appeal Judge, Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court.
In his petition, BASL President U.R. de Silva PC has cited members of Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) including its Director General Sarath Jayamanna PC, Chairman T.B. Weerasuriya, CIABOC members Justice W.L.R. Silva and Neville Guruge, Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz and Colombo Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara as respondents.
On January 18, the Bribery Commission filed a corruption case in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court against former Chief Justice and former Attorney General Mohan Peiris, Court of Appeal Judge A.H.M.D. Nawaz and former Secretary to the Ministry M.M.C. Ferdinando.
This is over an allegation that they conferred a wrongful or unlawful benefit, and favour or advantage on the perpetrators who had been accused of misappropriating funds belonging to Lanka Electricity Company (Private) Limited (LECO).
Taking into consideration the facts, Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara had issued summons on the three accused to be present in Court on March 8.
The petitioner stated that he learnt from newspapers that an application had been filed in the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court regarding inter alia Justice A.H.M.D. Nawaz.
BASL President U.R. de Silva, in his petition, said that upon perusal of the proceedings filed before the Magistrates Court, it was apparent to him that no offence in terms of the Bribery Act is disclosed against Justice Nawaz. He further said upon perusal of the proceedings filed before the Magistrates Court it was evident that the identity of the complainant, if any, is undisclosed.
The BASL President further said the proceedings before the Magistrates Court cannot be entertained or continued in that there has been no written sanction of the CIBOC.
He stated that the gravamen of the purported allegation made is that Justice Nawaz provided a legal opinion as a Deputy Solicitor General at the Attorney Generals Department in or around December 2010 to confer a wrongful or unlawful benefit or advantage on another person or knowing that the said legal opinion would cause a wrongful or unlawful benefit or advantage to another person.
The BASL President said ex facie a legal opinion cannot result in a wrongful or unlawful benefit. He further maintained that the question of conferring a wrongful or unlawful benefit or not depends on the correctness of the legal opinion.
He said ex facie no wrongful or unlawful benefit could have been caused to any person such as certain undisclosed directors of the Lanka Electricity Company Pvt Ltd and some other persons in that the decision to prosecute is in the hands of those responsible for the prosecution who are not bound by an opinion of the Attorney General.

Big Bash finish
The heat is on and we brace ourselves for what promises to be two huge impact semis ...Kandy vs CR & FC ....at Pallekelle and very much a huge day trip up for sure, and Havelocks vs Navy at Racecourse.
Kandy away from their safe cauldron...might show signs of rare weakness, and hand CR, a neat set of calculated opportunities that CR will look to exploit boiler beyond conventional limitations...at every given turn.
Their victory against fellow CH warriors couldnt have been better timed and points on the board ...CH visibly stunned by the wave of tries which was well engineered by Omalka and the boiler house boys. It was a solid team performance by the Reds, up and down the park. Winning the upfront battle was the clincher, and opened the Maitland boys on all fronts.
CH whose defence has been their Achilles heel, were short of drift and tackles ...which gave CR plenty of good ball to run .....and run they did to clock up a well worked 49 points at full time.
CH rising up to claw back that lead to 49-29 ...led by Muthu, Yoshita, Sathya...couldnt get their Maitland marauding machine to outwit the hungrier CR unit.
The casualty figures were higher and difficult to fathom at times ...but Ratwatte made sure all possession was maxed ...and running ball the simple plan last Saturday. CH had only themselves to chat options ...as we all know, catch up and knockout rugby are tough bedfellows.
Kandy stepped and brushed Air Force aside with customary ease to line up their semifinal clash and some casual thoughts on how they plan to grind CR down.
Havelocks will have many thoughts about options to exploit Navy and dominate them upfront in the sets and sharper, stronger to outmuscle Navy and win the breakdowns....this will be the critical factor and both sets of forwards ...itching to stamp their class and pile on the pressure.
On paper ...It looks like a Kandy v Havies final....but Clifford Cup knockouts are never about form...its about heart and ability to push past confrontation ...its patience power and wit ..to outthink ...and petrol to finish ...and a heap of skills that beggar description ...its about big finals and the instincts that separate mere players from incredible talent ...its Pandoras box and Lady Cliffords singular vision for rugby history.
Beyond the Clifford Cup finals unfolds Sri Lanka rugbys busiest and most comprehensive season ever ...from club to national and then to international on the rugby planet.
We start in March with our wild card to the World Series Hong Kong 7s, return home to grab new kit, and our date with destiny at the Commonwealth Games in Australia, where Sri Lanka meets Fiji and current Olympic champions in our group opener ....our greatest litmus test for 7s so far .....The season is too complex to imagine and the boys will certainly need extra to handle the pressure.
The Singer school season raises itself and much anticipation for family friends and rugby old boys who finance the team investment beyond our normal horizons ...naturally dominated by the bigger stables and proud history from March to August.
Singer Sri Lanka the proud partners to the countrys elite rugby league tournament and all the young branded warriors from each corner of our sports mad island nation.The NatWest 6 Nations ..kicks off another spectacular weekend..Fri 23 February...France v Italy..Marseille 1.30am Saturday Sri time.
24 February...Ireland v Wales Dublin 7.45pm, 24 February...,Scotland v England Edinburgh 10.15pm Calcutta Cup, 25 February....Clifford Cup finals Longdon Place 4pm.
Thats the tantalising list this February jolly ...prepare, plan, absorb the pressure and mind up for the impact....Adrenaline faithful be wary of getting the times well cleared ...There is little allocation for those who hesitate.
Celebration on either side of our rugby universe is reason for all islanders to elevate their minds and arm the hamstrings...
Cheers folks...
Bula Bula the hearts that live our time in the middle..!

He explained that while there was diplomatic pressure and the impact the incident had on the image of the country needed to be discussed, as far as the military was concerned, this was not a serious crime.
There have been people who supported him as well as criticized him for that and we just wish to find out what really happened given the circumstances, said Brigadier Atapattu. In early February, Brigadier Fernando was filmed while making a gesture which symbolized the cutting of a throat, in response to a group of Tamil protesters outside the High Commission.
Although the Foreign Ministry at the time immediately recalled him from service, the President later reinstated him.

Burying the hatchet
Encouraging signs emerged on Tuesday of a reunion between the estranged Unity Government partners, the UNP and the SLFP. Two high powered delegations from both parties were seen on television in convivial mood at the National Economic Council meeting presided over by President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo. The UNP was led by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe while the four member SLFP delegation, led by Dr. Sarath Amunugama, also included Minister John Seneviratne, one of the vocal advocates for the SLFP forming its own government.
The NEC was set up by the President in August last year with the aim of strengthening the national economy. Yesterday's meeting focused on the need to introduce an accelerated programme to rejuvenate the national economy by introducing the necessary reforms in economic management for the country, starting next week. NEC members spoke of the immediate need for economic management and steps that should be taken on a short, medium and long term basis. The main responsibility of the NEC is to take decisions on the national economy with emphasis laid on local agriculture and industries.
Of course, it is in these two areas that the government had been found wanting, if the results of the local government elections, in the rural hinterland, is any indication. The backlash of the farmers, as a whole, was unmistakable. It was only the other day that MP Ranjith Aluvihare owned up to the failure by the government in addressing the farmers woes in his area. He said the fertilizer subsidy did not go into their accounts properly and that there was inordinate delay in the issue of seeds to the farmers. They (farmers) also had difficulty in disposing of their harvests, resulting in large scale destruction of their crop. Farmers, interviewed on TV, also lamented the scarcity of water for their paddy fields and the damage to crops by wild elephants and other beasts.
Of course the prevailing drought contributed in no small measure to the hardships of the farmers, who were forced to forego their seasonal cultivation and in turn were unable to pay back their agriculture loans.
Had the government paid more attention to at least some of these problems of the farmers its showing would not have been all that bad in the agricultural areas. As it were, the collective wrath of farmers descended on the government in all its might, when considering the huge majorities by which the government lost in areas such as Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, Moneragala etc.
Local industrialists too had to bear heavy burdens due to the high cost of imported raw material and the fierce competition with foreign products, forcing some of these industries to put up shutters.
The government, if it is keen to see a turnaround in its electoral fortunes, should certainly get its act together and fast. Provincial Elections are slated for September, according to Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and it has little time to deliver. But deliver, it must, if it is not to suffer another electoral reversal. Hardships faced by the middle class and upper middle class voters which form the UNPs support base, should also be looked into, in all earnest. The cost of living, like the Prime Minister admitted, played a pivotal role in alienating the vast bulk of the UNPs traditional voters. Whatever happened to the Cost of Living Committee chaired by Minister Malik Samarawickrema. It should have acted when JO MPs were bringing coconuts, rice and other consumer items to their press conferences to drive home the point to the public.
It is well known that the slapping of VAT on many consumer goods was the chief cause for the soaring prices. True, the country is saddled with an astronomical debt burden, and, like the PM explained, this was a necessary measure to rid the country from the debt trap so that the next generation will be free from this millstone round their collective necks. It was also explained that the hardship will be only for a brief period until the country is rid of its foreign debt.
But the voters are an impatient lot and are not willing to wait for two years until our debt is repaid, to ease their burdens, as demonstrated by the LG election results. The government should have learned from past elections how the cost of living impacted the result. Mrs. Bandaranaike, who won a landslide in 1970, lost humiliatingly in 1977 primarily due to the "kitchen" vote though the scarcity of essential goods too played its part.
Be that as it may, the rapprochement of the UNP and the SLFP is bound to stabilize things and allow the Unity Government to take a fresh look at the whole picture in order to ascertain where it went wrong. The electoral backlash should now make the government shake itself off its indifference, plus, state of inaction, that is ingrained in the public perception and resolve to act with determination. Above all, a combined front should be presented to the public, lest the idea of instability once again creeps into the public consciousness regarding the government.

Cabinet approves Air Transport Bill
The Air Transport Bill which will give effect to the Montreal Conventions and deals with conforming to international standards and rules on international carriage of passengers, baggage and cargo was approved by the Cabinet.
The Montreal Convention which has been ratified by 112 countries protects the interests of passengers by introducing a modern two-tier liability system and by facilitating the swift recovery of proven damages without the need for lengthy litigation, stated the Cabinet paper on the subject.
Air carriers on the other hand, will be able to achieve substantive operational savings through the use of electronically produced and simplified documents (tickets) of carriage, especially (Airway bills) in the cargo field, and the ability to manage risks more efficiently.
Cabinet approval thus will allow the Transport and Civil Aviation Minister to present it to Parliament for enactment.
The approval to ratify the above Convention has been subject to a reservation where the Act shall not apply to: International carriage by air performed and operated directly by the State of Sri Lanka for non-commercial purposes in respect of its functions and duties as a sovereign state and/or
The carriage of persons, cargo and baggage for its military authorities on aircraft registered of leased by the State of Sri Lanka, the whole capacity of which has been reserved by or on behalf of such authorities.

Call to withdraw amendments to LG election Act
The government needs to hold all elections under the previous system in the future as the new Local Government election system has many shortcomings. Amendments to the Local and Provincial Councils Elections brought in Parliament should be withdrawn, said Commerce and Industry Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
He was addressing the media at the Commerce and Industry Ministry auditorium on Tuesday.
The government has learnt a good lesson through the results of the new Local Government election system. There are many LG bodies still in difficulty to form governance and choose the Mayor and Chairman. The results had confused the people about good governance.
The good governance government has to consider the plight of minorities as they contributed highly to bring in the good governance government. Minorities were mostly affected through this new system. The minorities wanted to bring a change in governance at the Presidential Election and General Election in 2015 as they were severely affected by the previous regime. Especially Muslims were affected in various ways, he said.
The mixed system - the First Past the Post System and Proportional Representation, has many shortcomings according to the final results released by the Election Department.
We, the All Ceylon Muslim Congress, urge the government to give up the amendments brought to the Provincial Council and General Elections. We further urge the opposition leader and other political party leaders to look into the negative effects of the new system, the minister said.
We requested the government not to bring amendments to the Local Government Election Act, pointing out that the amendment would affect minority communities and minority political parties. However, the government brought it into operation. Now the country is experiencing hardships as there is no way to find solutions to the shortcomings through the Act," he added.
The minister said: The ACMC secured 166 seats in 15 districts at the Local Government election. We had only 42 members at the last LG polls. The ACMC has grown according to the results, but the new system is not suitable to the country. Therefore, the government has to take action to withdraw all new Acts relevant to the elections, he said. Deputy Minister M. S. S. Ameer Ali, Parliamentarians Ishaq, Navavi, Abdullah Mahroof, Secretary to the party S. Subaideen, members Rusthy Habeeb, N.M.Shaheed, Private Secretary Rifkhan Badiudeen, MPC Faiz and former VC S. M.

Pride of place for investment
The huge manpower available in rural and urban areas should be utilised for national development. Most of the government contracts should be given to youth groups. Company formation among youth should be promoted by the government as a means of giving the youth an opportunity to participate in the construction field by pooling their experience resources gain legal recognition and acquire appropriate managerial and technical experience, to face the challenge of infrastructural development in the country.
The active support of the country and the assistance of the relevant institution should come together to establish these youth construction companies which can be called village construction companies - VCC.
The government expects to disperse Rs. 60,000 million through state and private banks, to would be, entrepreneurs and another Rs. 5,000 million has been set aside by the Treasury to reimburse the interest subsidy to the banks.
With the objective to create one million new jobs to unemployed youth, the government experts the SME sector to be the backbone of the economy. This Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme one of the main proposals made in the recent budget to create entrepreneurs would be launched in March.
The concept of the white collar, jobs, decent salaries and social dignity are some of the factors which are pressuring the youth mind. This approach should have a consideration in the new setup.
The national level planners need a completely new pipeline to reach this youth for their own progress. The correct guidance and motivation with financial assistance and managerial training should be channeled to these primary V.C.C. Companies at the very start.
The organisation structure would come out with a workforce of unskilled, skilled supervisory, technical, managerial etc. in implementing the work with dignity and honour.

Colombo doctors prepare for Dengue
With another Dengue fever outbreak likely in the next two months, doctors are trying to prepare for an increase in patients.
Last year, there was a time no hospitals had beds, Consultant Physician Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama recalled at Lanka Hospitals Wednesday.
But we have learned lessons, he added. Weve had a lot of experience treating patients.
Dr.Wijewickrama said many Dengue patients will recover on their own, and dont need to go to the hospital. Whats necessary is rest and fluids, he said.
But he admitted that its hard to tell which patients will develop complications like vomiting, pain, and bleeding, which require hospitalisation.
Dr.Mahesh Harishchandra, a consulting physician at Lanka Hospitals, said there are several warning signs people should be aware of. The fever actually goes down before complications, he said. Other signs are decreased urine output, and dizziness.
If your fever goes down and you continue to be weak with no urine output, complications are coming, he said. The resolution of fever does not mean you are necessarily better.
The doctors urged people to keep their homes and neighbourhoods free of mosquito-breeding areas, like standing water and open garbage, and to monitor their health as the season approaches. They also said Dengue patients taking precautions to not get bit again while they are sick could vastly reduce the spread of fever.
The rates of dengue cases are already rising in the Kurunegala, Kandy, and Jaffna areas,doctors said. This is the time to direct people for prevention, Dr.Harishchandra said. We are anticipating an epidemic, rather than waiting for it.

Committee set up to prioritize development projects
A committee headed by Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama has been appointed to make a priority list of mega projects the government can implement within the next two years.
The committee comprising both SLFP and UNP ministers would set the economic priorities of the government and decide on which ones will have the greatest impact on the people.
Co-Cabinet spokesperson Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department said, the President had informed the Cabinet this week that all mega projects would have to be approved by this committee.
Accordingly, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasams proposal to introduce tabs to all schoolchildren at a cost of Rs. 4 billion was rejected by the President on the grounds that complete implementation was not a current economic priority, said Minister Senaratne.
The President pointed out that instead of spending Rs. 4 billion on the project, it would be more prudent to implement it in phases and start with a pilot project using 20 percent of the cost. He then asked that they measure its effectiveness and response from the students and proceed from there, he said.
Several other proposed mega projects too have been postponed until they receive the go-ahead from this committee which will evaluate their national importance.
We also have a debt ceiling to worry about. So we cannot take loans for every project, he said.
The third phase of the Central Expressway project, however, received the green light from the Cabinet despite several questions raised on it this week. We decided that this needs to be implemented as it was also a promise we made in our manifesto, said the minister. Section 3 of the Expressway from Pothuhera to Galagedara via Rambukkana has been awarded to M/s Taisei Corporation of Japan pending the signing of loan negotiations for 100 billion Yen from the Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi and Nippon Export and Investment Insurance.
The Cabinet paper for the project was presented to the Cabinet by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Dinosaurs inspired  Lord of  the Rings  Gollum
Turns out, dinosaurs led to the creation of Gollum in Peter Jacksons The Lord of the Rings.
Gollum was one of the characters created by Joe Letteri, a four-time Oscar winner, Weta Digitals senior VFX supervisor and 2018s recipient of the Visual Effects Societys Georges Melies Award.
According to the Hollywood Reporter, 60-year-old Letteri, who had worked as a CG artist on 1993s Jurassic Park, explained, I became interested in what made something like a dinosaur look realistic - some of that was the detail that you see in the dinosaur skin. I also started learning about cinematography and lighting.
Seeing those creatures come alive onscreen, he realised the next step was to use similar techniques to create a character, and Gollum was the perfect opportunity to do that.
While Gollum started with Andy Serkis performance capture, the challenge for Letteri was creating a facial performance that would believably convey human expressions. I had never had to work with a character that was so humanlike, delivering a compelling performance onscreen right next to other actors.
Having set the bar more than once, Letteri, whose work on Avatar took it all one step further, admitted that it now keeps getting raised higher.
If you could do one Gollum, you must be able to do a whole planet full, he noted. Figure out how to do something new, and it quickly expands into having to do lots of them. Thats still hard to do; its still a very artist-dependent medium. ANI

Dont introduce new mixed electoral system to PC, Parliamentary polls
The All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) has asked the government not to introduce the new mixed electoral system to the Provincial Council and Parliamentary elections.
Today we have a situation where many councils cannot be established because of the new system, said Leader of the ACMC, Rishard Bathuideen addressing a media briefing yesterday at the Ministry of Industry and Commerce.
He added that the new system was introduced amidst intense objections put forward by his and other smaller parties.
This was introduced to benefit the two main parties and destroy the smaller parties so that they wont have to depend on them, said Bathuideen.
The inability to form councils in many areas had risen due to certain councils not being able to meet the 25 percent quota on women, They wanted a quota for women and now we cant form a council, observed an irate minister.
An analysis of the recent election results, however, revealed that the ACMC has in fact managed to significantly increase the number of seats won in the local government bodies they contested under the new system.
The party had increased their number of seats from 42 in 2011 to 166 members this year. Further, the party which contested under the United National Front in many of the areas, with Hassan Alis United Peace Front in Ampara and independently in Trincomalee, had also expanded their base to new areas such as Kandy, Kurunegala and Negombo.
Bathuideen however insisted that their opposition to the new system was not based on their partys achievements but for the overall betterment of the country,
It is true that we have done much better under the new system but electoral systems are supposed to be designed to help the country. The decisions taken by our leaders to support either themselves or their respective party has destroyed the country for the last 40 years, he explained.
When asked about his views on the current political crisis, Bathuideen said they would support a stable unity government which would stick by the January 8 2015 mandate.

Edirisinghe Brothers Hybrid Hub, SLIC to facilitate Hybrid Vehicle Clinics
Edirisinghe Brothers Hybrid Hub and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation (SLIC) have come together once again to host more Hybrid Vehicle Clinics similar to the inaugural programme carried out in December 2017 at Racecourse, Colombo 7.
More Hybrid Car Clinics are to take place in other major cities across the island, including one in Colombo within the next six months.
The Hybrid Vehicle Clinics will allow vehicle owners opportunities to have a multi-point vehicle health check done by the Hybrid Vehicle Experts free of charge and obtain advice on Hybrid-Grade preventive maintenance in addition to Hybrid vehicle operating tips to maximize efficiency and avoid unnecessary repairs.
Commenting on the initiative Co-Chief Operating Officer of Edirisinghe Brothers Hybrid Hub, Sanka Edirisinghe said, Hybrid vehicles are somewhat different from conventional petrol or diesel powered vehicles in terms of the technology involved and requires a different approach to maintenance.
This specialty approach is vital in order to prevent expensive repairs which may occur at a later period. Hybrid vehicles require technicians and service advisors with in-depth knowledge about the technology behind the vehicle as well as specific training. Hence, we at Hybrid Hub use our dedicated training facilities to follow onsite training combined with online training programmes with our technology partners based in the U.S.A. and Singapore.
With the Sri Lankan Hybrid vehicle market growing, SLIC was keen to address many of our customers predicament of being unaware of basic maintenance knowledge required for a Hybrid vehicle.
The last Hybrid Vehicle Clinic with Hybrid Hub was well received by our MotorPlus customers and from other Hybrid vehicle owners.
Given the positive response and to provide a further opportunity for those who would have missed the clinic in December 2017, multiple clinics will be introduced to include regions such as the Central Province. SLIC being a pioneer in the insurance sector, it was important for us to partner with a like-minded partner with industry expertise - we are indeed privileged to collaborate with Edirisinghe Brothers, commented a spokesperson from SLIC.
Hybrid vehicles unlike the traditional petrol and diesel vehicles, is a technology centric vehicle that requires preventive maintenance on a periodical basis, to mitigate unnecessary and expensive repairs.
Combined experience and market insights by both Hybrid Hub and MotorPlus has helped to identify a considerable shortage in understanding preventive maintenance and service facilities that are specialized for hybrid vehicles.

Epilogue to the days of tension
Almost two weeks after elections to 340 local government bodies were concluded, the major political parties remain locked in a tussle for supremacy, leaving the government in a state of flux with no clear winner emerging at the time of writing.
There was a clear winner though at the elections and that was the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP). The newly formed party served as a vehicle for the dissident faction of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, enabling him to test his popularity. Obtaining 45 per cent of the vote, it finished comfortably ahead of the SLFP and the United National Party (UNP).
This had led to diverse demands from the three parties and it is these demands that President Maithripala Sirisena has had to give ear to. Ten days after intense lobbying and behind the scenes manoeuvring, the future direction of the government is yet to become crystal clear.
The initial demand from the SLPP and former President Rajapaksa himself was that a general election should be called. This was on the basis that the yahapaalanaya government had lost the mandate to govern.
However, Rajapaksa would have known that this is not possible under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which precludes dissolution of Parliament until February 2020, unless it is dissolved with two-thirds of the sitting members voting for dissolution- a prospect that wouldnt become a reality in the current Parliament.
Self-styled Joint Opposition (JO)
The SLPP is also demanding that its parliamentary faction, the self-styled Joint Opposition (JO) be recognised as the largest opposition grouping in Parliament and be offered the Leader of the Opposition position. The thinking is that Rajapaksa would be very effective in that role, especially with presidential and general elections due in 2020, in January and August respectively.
However this is also not possible simply because JO parliamentarians contested the August 2015 general election under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) banner- and the UPFA remains part and parcel of the government. For the JO to claim the Leader of the Opposition position, the UPFA should join the opposition ranks en masse- and that is also extremely unlikely. While the SLPPs demands are aimed at creating political mischief in the aftermath of its election victory, the SLFP found itself in a more pressing predicament. The SLFP had finished the election in a distant third position, polling a mere 13 per cent of the vote. In some councils, they had polled less votes than the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP). In such a situation, SLFP Members of Parliament are confronted with a harsh political reality: if the current trend continues they could well be out of the next Parliament, after general elections in August 2020.
It is to counteract this possibility that they swung into action. There were also indications that most of them would not be welcomed with open arms by the SLPP. The SLPP had its own organisers at the electorate level who had toiled hard in the last two years- and they wouldnt hand that to a parliamentarian returning to the fold after enjoying the perks of office in government.
National Unity government
The initial demand from the SLFP was for the removal of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. There were suggestions that the National Unity government could be resurrected under a different Prime Minister from the UNP. Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas name was being bandied about although he had quite politely but equally firmly indicated that he would not be entertaining such a possibility.
These moves drew howls of protest from the UNP. How dare the SLFP- which recorded an abysmal number of votes at the election and finished third- dictate terms to the UNP as to who should be Prime Minister, UNP parliamentarians asked. If anything, the SLFPs demand made the UNPers close ranks alongside Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
By this time, some UNPers were demanding that the party go it alone, with the support of either the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) on an issue by issue basis or the support of selected SLFP stalwarts who had indicated a willingness to join the UNP-led government.
It was then that the SLFP began its counter move. SLFP ministers made public pronouncements that it was seeking to install a pure SLFP government. A signature campaign got underway to demonstrate support for a SLFP Prime Minister with Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva as the possible nominee. For its part, the SLPP announced that it would support a SLFP led government headed by de Silva, but would refrain from obtaining ministerial portfolios in such a government.
Against such a backdrop, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe met the media last Friday afternoon. Usually not very media savvy, the Prime Minister emerged impressing journalists with his calm and relaxed demeanour. More importantly he argued his case convincingly: under the Constitution, Wikremesinghe said, he cannot be removed.
The Constitution, in its recently introduced 19th Amendment, through Article 46(2), specifies the instances when a Prime Minister ceases to hold office. There does not appear to be a specific provision for the President to remove the Prime Minister other than when he loses the confidence of Parliament by losing a vote in the legislature.
Legal experts
Prime Minister Wickemesinghes assertion was a setback to those SLFP ministers who were shuttling for negotiations between the mainstream SLFP and the SLPP leadership to fashion a compromise to try and forma SLFP-SLPP government. Legal experts took to the media, some suggesting that the President could, by dismissing the Cabinet, remove Wickremesinghe. Others supported Wickremesinghes view, arguing that there was no constitutional provision for the removal of the Prime Minister by the President.
The SLFP has decided to explore this matter even further. Its parliamentarians have urged that the matter be referred by the President to the Supreme Court for a ruling. It was reported that, contrary to the previous reports of the SLFP quitting the government forthwith if Prime Minister Wickremesinghe didnt resign, they had been requested by President Sirisena to stay in the government until the issue was resolved with a reference to the Supreme Court. At the time of writing, there was no confirmation that the matter had been formally referred to the Supreme Court.
A debate in Parliament on Monday shed little light on new developments. Meanwhile, the major parties have entrenched themselves in what are now familiar positions: the UNP claiming that it is able to command the confidence of the House and form a stable government and the SLFP still exploring avenues to appoint its own Prime Minister.
The SLPP meanwhile is happy to rest on its laurels for now. Clearly, it has set its sights not on short term ministerial portfolios but on the two major national elections in 2020. It feels it can return to power then and is no hurry to oust this government now. On the contrary, some of its leaders believe that entering government now would be detrimental to its electoral prospects in 2020.
There is a high likelihood of a Cabinet reshuffle and a UNP led government- minus a few SLFP stalwarts- coming into being shortly, subject to clearance from the Supreme Court, if the matter is indeed referred to the Supreme Court. This is because the SLFP is, at present, unable to demonstrate a clear majority in Parliament. Had they been able to do so, they would have moved to oust the Prime Minister by now.
What is clear is that the current state of uncertainty cannot continue for long. Whichever party emerges as the government, they will need to take a strong stand not only to ensure their own survival vis--vis the 2020 elections but also for the future stability and well-being of the nation.

Eshan Pieris sweeps up first F4 SEA win
The 2017-18 FIA Formula 4 South East Asia Championship (F4 SEA) - fuelled by Petron, witnessed Eshan Pieris first ever win for Sri Lanka at the Sepang International Circuit as the contingent supported the Asian Le Man Endurance Series.
After an intense battle in Race 2 of the penultimate event, the 20-year-old Colombo-native stood atop the podium when the Sri Lankan national anthum was aired. Eshan basked humbly in the glory of his maiden victory of the championship.
Eshan was poised to be the front runner of the FIA-certified Championship, as he was fastest in official free practise and snatched up pole position in qualifying. This boosted his drive to succeed.
Launched off the grid perfectly behind two-time event champion Daniel Cao in the events second race, the Sri Lankan threw down the hammer and quickly stole pole position away from Cao, who then subsequently piled on the pressure.
Despite this, Eshan consistently pulled away from Cao and widened the gap till the chequered flag waved him the race victory in a very strong grid. Eshan beat tough competition from undefeated Rookie Event champion Kane Shepherd, Okinawan lightning bolt, HibikiTaira and Event Champion Mitchell Cheah of Malaysia.
Apart from securing the podium in Race 2, Eshan also clocked the fastest time of the eight-lap scrimmage. He was the only one to break the 2-minute 14-second mark in the race. His blistering performance ensured him a lead of almost five seconds.
After being fastest on track during the free practice, I was really motivated to put it back on top at the end of qualifying. I really just focused on hitting all my markers on track and not making any mistakes throughout the laps in qualifying.
In Race 2 I started in P2 and took the lead on the 2nd lap into turn 4 and thereafter I just focused on maintaining my rhythm throughout the race. However my biggest concern was tyre conservation. Just like Formula One, managing tyre wear is crucial, explained Eshan.
Despite some of the setbacks Eshan faced over the course of the weekend, he kept up his spirits and held his head high, determined to do better next time.
For sure the win in Race 2 felt really great since it was only my second event ever in formula cars and compared to the other drivers on the grid I had less experience. I am really happy to bag my first big win, concluded Eshan.

FCCISL kicks off SME, Micro Membership drive from Puttalam District
The Federation of Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) this week launched their much awaited national level program to issue membership to small, medium and micro scale businesses with the objective of setting up a common platform to better manage and promote the informal sector.
All 25 district chambers and their affiliate bodies have been requested by the FCCISL to strengthen their respective units by enrolling entrepreneurs within their respective regions to join the national body. This is the initial step towards setting up of a national registry of SMEs and Micro entrepreneurs, which has been lacking in the existing monitoring and management system.
FCCISL is the first among the various chamber bodies to reach out to grass roots level tapping entrepreneurs with the objective of drawing up end to end solutions to the various issues faced by the rural business community.
Primary among the set target of FCCISL is to compile a strong data base of their island-wide membership with vital information of each member pertaining to their type of business, business processes, supply chain, market info, sales and marketing support, financial advice and assistance and market access, Ajith Perera Secretary General of FCCISL said.
Recently FCCISL entered into a strategic partnership with Channel17 Loyalty to bring in additional valuable features and IT support to strengthen the Federations membership drive.
With the wide network of consumer groups and the loyalty management tools, CH17 will extend their services to build an effective network of SMEs and micros for the Federation, Jumar Preena CEO of CH17 added.
Marketing has been identified as the biggest challenge face by the SMEs, Jumar pointed out. We are keen to support them with access to large consumer groups, ease of access to basic of technology to improve better planning and financial advice through our partner bank  Commercial Bank.
The CBOC Governor Dr. Indrajith Coomaraswamy in his remarks at a forum recently had pointed out that the biggest challenge and the area where Sri Lanka has done the least so far (to develop the SME Sector) is Marketing. The FCCISL is determined to address this issue, Jumar further explained.

Flake off
Dandruff is a problem most of us encounter at some point in our lives. However, for others it is an ongoing issue that might only be made worse if they do not follow the right steps to combat or minimalism the issue. Follow these remedies to get rid of those white flakes naturally.
Does dandruff only affects the scalp
Dandruff is a very common skin condition that nearly everyone experiences at some point in their lives regardless of age or ethnicity. It affects not just the scalp, but also the ears, eyebrows.
Dandruff and hair fall
Dandruff is a cosmetic disease. Its not contagious, and it wont lead to other health problems. But if left untreated, it can become so itchy and inflamed that it causes temporary hair loss. That is another good reason to wash your hair with a dandruff shampoo. Once you have treated your scalp, the hair will probably grow back.
Anti dandruff shampoo work
A majority of dandruff shampoos use active ingredients to temporarily re-balance the scalps pH balance. Since shampoos vary on the types of active ingredients they use and their strength, the pH balance effect does not usually last long for over the counter brands. All dandruff shampoos are not made equally, however, so it is recommended to use more than one type to maximize results.
Diet to prevent or reduce dandruff
If you are struggling with dandruff, eat plenty of foods rich in B vitamins. Vitamin B6 can be found in a variety of foods like beans, meat, poultry, fish, and some fruits and vegetables.
Zinc requires vitamin B6 for proper absorption in the intestines, and is found in a variety of food like oysters, red meat, poultry, legumes, nuts, and grains.
Drink six to eight glasses of water.
Avoid dried fruits, chocolates, and deep fried foods.
Include green leafy vegetables like spinach daily in your diet.
If you are a non-vegetarian, eat more of fish and chicken. If you are a vegetarian, include more milk and its products to give you more protein.
Vitamin A and C play an important role in keeping the skin healthy. Vitamin A is present in some animal foods like butter and ghee, whole milk, curds, egg yolk, liver etc. Fish liver oils like Cod and Holibut are some of the richest known natural sources of the vitamins. Today these oils are available in the market in the form of capsules. Take one capsule daily. For the vegetarians, leafy vegetables such as spinach and red and yellow coloured fruits and vegetables like mangoes, papaya and tomato are rich sources of Carotene. For Vitamin C, include citrus fruits like orange, sweet lime and guava in your diet. Sprouted legumes are also high in Vitamin C.
Essential oils good for dandruff
Tea Tree Essential Oil
Lavender Essential Oil
Rosemary Essential Oil
Thyme Essential Oil
Peppermint Essential Oil
Chamomile Essential Oil

Former Schoolboy Cricketer Kusal Mendis proves his worth in Bangladesh
Yet another former Observer Schoolboy Cricketer - Kusal Mendis, has piloted Sri Lanka to a smashing 2-0 victory in the T20 International series against Bangladesh. He was in cracking form in both the T20 internationals with back to back explosive half centuries.
Having made a brilliant knock of 53 in the first match in Dhaka, Mendis continued his good work in their series deciding second match in Sylhet with another great knock of 70.
Most importantly, Mendis has showed great courage to bounce back and cement his place in the national team. After being axed from the team for the previous tour to India following a modest performance against Pakistan in the UAE, he made a great return during the teams recently concluded tour of Bangladesh.
Generally considered as a middle order batsman, Mendis was elevated as an opener since the Test series and it has paid rich dividends. Prior to the tour of Bangladesh, Mendis has hardly tasted new ball attacks, despite opening in a few matches at the early part of his career.
Sri Lanka captain Dinesh Chandimal, another former Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year who had won the mega title four year before Mendis, paid a lavish tribute to his newly found opening batsman. We had a chat at the start of the series and we thought that he could fit in as an opener. By promoting him as an opener, we were also able to get right-hand/left-hand combination with the opening pair. I think he grabbed all the opportunities that came his way. Thats a really good sign, skipper Chandimal was quoted as saying.
Mendis was in total command over Bangladesh bowling attack in the second T2oI to make 70 off in only 42 balls, hitting three sixers and six fours. He shared an opening partnership of 98 runs off 11 overs with Danushka Gunathilaka (42). Their solid foundation  the second successive half century stand, enabled Sri Lanka to make a commanding 210 for 4 in their allotted 20 overs.
Thanks to Mendis quick fire 70, Sri Lanka was able to set a commanding target of 211. It was daunting task for the home team which was eventually bowled out for 135 runs in 18.4 overs, giving Sri Lanka a thumping victory.
When Bangladesh made a commanding 193 for 5 in 20 overs in the first T20 International in Dhaka, it appeared to be a daunting task for Sri Lanka. However, when Sri Lanka got that dream start they had been looking for, the visitors ultimately found it easy to reach the target with 20 balls to spare for the loss of only four wickets.
The architect of Sri Lankas convincing six-wicket victory in the first T20I was none other than that of dashing opener Kusal Mendis who showed no mercy to Bangladesh attack. He simply massacred Bangladesh bowlers with a blistering knock of 53 runs off just 27 balls, maintaining a stunning strike rate of 196.29.
Man of the Match Mendis, who hit two massive sixers and eight boundaries, added 53 runs for the first wicket with Gunathilaka off only 29 balls. Their epic alliance eased the pressure on Sri Lankas middle order, though the visitors lost three wickets with the addition of only 37 runs. Foundation laid the explosive start given by Mendis and Gunathilaka, Sri Lanka reached the target in style through an unfinished fifth wicket partnership of 65 runs between Thisara Perera and Dasun Shanaka.
Mendis has lavishly contributed with his willow during his school career at Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa. His rich harvests during the 2012/13 season earned him the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2013.
Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title is widely regarded as an unofficial passage towards the national team and Mendis is yet another cricketer who had proved that this common belief among schoolboy cricketers is right. Within a couple of years after his crowning glory at the Mega Show, Mendis was picked to make his Test debut - against the West Indies at Premadasa Stadium on October 22, 2015.
A reliable wicket keeper and consistent right-hand top order batsman with an attacking style, Mendis has often posed trouble to many opponents. Merely months after winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title five years ago, he was appointed Sri Lankas under-19 captain for the Youth World Cup.
He made his Sri Lanka ODI debut with a sparkling half century 51 off 59 balls with eight boundaries in Sri Lankas first ODI against Ireland in Dublin on June 16, 2016. Since then, Mendis has represented Sri Lanka in 44 ODIs to aggregate a total of 1,239 runs for an average of 30.97.
He has one century and 11 fifties to his credit with a career best knock of 102. In 24 Tests, Mendis has aggregated 1,712 runs with four centuries and five fifties. He was the top scorer for Sri Lanka in the first innings in the recent second Test against Bangladesh in Dhaka - a superb innings of 68 made off 98 balls that eventually guided Sri Lanka to a match-winning first innings lead.
Mendis emergence was a blessing to the national team at a time the national selectors had been looking for a top order batsman. The first three batting positions are important to any team as the roles of openers and one drop batsman could make a big impact towards a team total and the morale of the middle and lower order batsmen.
Since winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2013, he has proved his credentials to fit into that vital No.3 position which fell vacant after the retirement of veteran Kumar Sangakkara.
The biggest moment in Mendis short but impressive Test career so far was witnessed last year when he made a marathon knock of 194 in the first Test against Bangladesh in Galle.
He missed what would have been a dream double century by unsuccessfully attempting to signal it with a six. His superb knock included four sixers and 19 boundaries.
Occupying the crease for more than seven hours and facing 285 balls, Mendis showed qualities of a mature Test batsman, although it was only in his 15th Test. He became only the third Sri Lankan to aggregate over 1,000 Test runs before completing 23 years of age, behind Arjuna Ranatunga and Mahela Jayawardene. Speaking after his title glory in 2013, Mendis said the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of The Year Award is a launching pad for his future cricket career. In less than five years after winning the title, Mendis has proved this right beyond reasonable doubt.
Speaking further after winning that dream title, Mendis went on to pay a generous tribute to the organizers of the show the Sunday Observer and Mobitel, stating that the contest was a tower of strength for young schoolboy cricketers.
There are several past winners who had gone to represent the country. That shows how valuable the contest is for the budding cricketers. The contest has been boosted further with the introduction of the third segment which will undoubtedly help the outstation cricketers enormously. The talented players outside Colombo could be identified better and that augurs well for a better tomorrow. Besides the main awards, there are many other segments in the competition that has been won. These sections too, help the youngsters in their future cricket career, he was quoted as saying.

Global warming
Global warming is a phenomena in which there is a gradual increase in the average temperature of the Earths atmosphere and its oceans. This change is believed to have serious implications on our planet and is permanently changing the Earths climate. This can be also seen as an implication of mans greedy nature and the over exploitation of our mother nature in the hunt for more resources.
For centuries we have brutally exploited our resources, thoughtlessly wasted it and reaped profits without a thought about our future generations. Over the last century, the average temperature of the globe has increased by more than 1F or 0.7C .Global warming is primarily a problem because of too much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere which acts as a blanket, trapping heat and warming the planet more and more. As we burn fossil fuels like coal, petrol, diesel and natural gas for energy or cut down and burn forests to create plantations, carbon accumulates and overloads our atmosphere.
Certain waste management and agricultural practices aggravate the problem by releasing other potent global warming gases, such as methane and nitrous oxide. A warming world also has the potential to change rainfall patterns, increase droughts and severe storms, melt glaciers, increase sea levels, and even change plant and animal behaviour.
Today we have substantial scientific evidence which indicates that an increase in the global average temperature of more than 2F above from where we are today poses severe risks to the natural systems and the human health and well-being. The world has already realized the potential aftermath of Global warming and has started a massive campaign to reduce its effect. There is no single solution to global warming but a multi faced approach like focusing more towards clean and green energy production, increasing the efficiency of the current systems, gradual facing out of the fossil fuels, prevention of deforestation and ensuring sustainable development etc. can be taken to solve this problem. Countries around the world have been submitting their pledges to the United Nations, displaying how far they intend to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions over a period of time.

Hard work  and planning
Every boy and girl is born with multiple talents but not every man and women can achieve success in life. The only factor which lies between talent and success is hard work and planning.
Michelangelo, one of the greatest artist who ever lived once said-If people knew how hard I worked to achieve my mastery, it wouldnt seem so wonderful after all. His words resonates how hard work played a part in defining the successes in his life. When Angelo Mathews hits a six or when Roger Federer wins a title, we will never see the years of hard work, efforts and sacrifices these people took to achieve that successful moment.
Life is always full of challenges. Failures are part of it. As a student, the difficult mathematics formulas we have to crack, the length of historical dates we have to memorize, are all challenges and its normal that we struggle to master them. However persistence efforts and hard work along with little planning often pays off. Having said that it is also one of the most difficult things to master. Hard work is a quality which becomes part of your habit and is something we have to develop overtime. One of the secret formulas to this is planning. Students should always plan their next day and set targets on various activities they have to cover the next day including study time and home work. A detailed diary writing on your plans also will help. We should make conscious effort actively so that we always stick to the plan and execute them well. Practicing this over a period of time will make it a habit and part of your life and you will find the magic of success within your fingertips.

Led by the Carbon Consulting Company, Hirdaramani Group and Patagonia have pledged to match 2,000 trees each in a Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) effort to improve the bio-diversity of the region and the lives of rural farmers in local communities. Hiniduma is a mixed agricultural community surrounded by one of Sri Lankas last remaining rainforest ecosystems. Hirdaramani's sustainability team travelled to the Hiniduma Bio-Link location for the official launch of the project.
Commenting on this initiative, Nikhil Hirdaramani - Group Director, Hirdaramani, said, Hirdaramani sees projects like the Hiniduma Bio-Link Project as an opportunity to use our influence in the region for good. Sustainability is an important goal at the Hirdaramani Group and for us sustainability is about corporate responsibility.

Inflation dips again
Director General of Census and Statistics Dr. Amara Satharasinghe, issuing National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), for the month of January 2018, says that the Year on Year inflation based on NCPI has declined to 5.4% from 7.3% in December 2017.
Inflation of 5.4% reported for January 2018 is the lowest inflation reported since January 2017. Contributions to the inflation in January 2018 from food group and non-food group are 4.0% and 1.4% respectively, whilst contributions of these two groups to the inflation in January 2017 were 2.9% and 3.6% respectively, resulting headline inflation of 6.5%.
However, when compared to month on month changes, NCPI in January 2018 has decreased to 125.8 from 126.6 reported in December 2017. This shows a decrease of 0.8 index points or 0.6 percentage points in January 2018 as compared to December 2017. This month on month change was due to the decrease of expenditure value of food items by 0.78% and increase of non-food items by 0.11%.
The decrease in expenditure value of food items was due to the price decreases of vegetables, green chilies, coconuts, red onions, rice, limes, big onions, mysore dhal, potatoes, garlic and eggs.
The increase in expenditure value of non food items in January 2018 compared to the previous month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of Restaurant and Hotels, Transport, Miscellaneous Goods and Services, Education, Health and Clothing and Footwear.

Kandy SC scored their points off 2 goals, 3 tries and 3 penalty kicks and CR & FC through 3 goals and 1 try. At half time Kandy SC led 22/7.
Kandy SC handled the ball well to keep CR & FC in their place, that forced them into committing a couple of mistakes especially on and off in the first half. CR & FC played better rugby in the second half but forgot how to win.
Kandy SCs win yesterday was their 16th consecutive win of the season so far in the league and the knockouts. They are yet to be beaten in both formats.
Kandy SC played with confidence in the first half, especially the first 35 minutes. They came out firing and it worked well for them. But in the second half CR & FC regrouped after hard fought first half to score three quick tries and seemed to have found their touch. However Kandy SC brought out their experience at winning into play when it mattered. Scorers for Kandy SC were Danushka Ranjan three tries, Sreenath Sooriyabandara and Gayan Weeraratne one each. Nigel Ratwatte goalled two tries and put over two penalties and Thilina Wijesinghe one penalty.

Legal action to be taken against candidates who violated Election laws

The People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFEREL) will take legal action against candidates who breached the Election law at the recently concluded Local Authorities Elections.
PAFFREL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi told the Daily News that 15 such candidates have been identified so far in the first round of information gathering.
The candidates who bribed the voters are among them. All of them are from the main parties. However, we need to collect concrete evidence before filing cases and at times the people hesitate to come out and give evidence, he said.
Commenting on the list of 80 corrupt candidates in the fray at the previous elections as identified by the PAFFEREL, he said the majority had been defeated, but about 10 such candidates had won while two of them had been nominated as Heads of LG bodies.
All of them represent the main parties and we decided to write to the General Secretaries of those parties urging not to appoint them as Heads of those respective LG bodies, he said.
He also regretted that the billon 'Campaign Finance Upper Limitation for Elections', which the PAFFEREL took the initiation to draft, was handed over to the Government in August last year but did not proceed thereafter.
He said the Election watchdog groups have decided to collectively pressure the Government to adopt the legislation before the forthcoming Provincial Council Elections.

Lenin in Sri Lanka
How could you knead sad Russian dough into any sort of shape Why was he born in that uncouth country Just because a quarter of his blood was Russian, fate had hitched him to the ramshackle Russian rattletrap. A quarter of his blood, but nothing of his character , his will, his inclinations made him kin to that slovenly ,slapdash, eternally drunken country. Lenin knew of nothing more revolting than back-slapping Russian hearties, tearful tavern penitents, self-styled geniuses bewailing their ruined lives. Lenin was a bowstring, or an arrow from the bow. What then tied him to that country With a little more work he could have mastered three European languages, as he had mastered that semi-tarter tongue. He was tied, you say to Russia by twenty years as a practicing revolutionary Yes, but by nothing else Lenin in Zurich - Solzhenitsyn
In his acclaimed Lenin in Zurich ,Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel prize winning writer takes us into the torrential stream of Vladimir Ilyichs (Lenin) thoughts and feelings just a few months before the world shattering revolution of 1917. Living in exile in neutral Switzerland ( the Great War was in its second bloody year), the idea of returning to Russia, leave alone the prospect of a successful overthrowing of the hated Tsar and the system he represented, seemed hopelessly unrealistic to the implacable revolutionary. Years as a refugee, a life of unremitting denials and hardships, ideological conflicts and schisms, the pressures of guiding the activities of an underground party in that enormous and dangerous country from exile and his ceaseless theoretical work had drained him.
He was nearing the end of his forty-seventh year, in an anxious, monotonous life of nothing but ink on paper, enmities and alliances, quarrels and agreements that sprang up and faded in a day, or a week, all enormously important, all requiring enormous tact and skill, and always with politicians so much inferior to himself, all of it water into a bottomless bucket, instantly lost and forgotten, labour in vain. In a life of constant agitation, twisting and turning, his whole achievement was to fight his way into an impassable rubbish heap.
Such was Lenins gloomy state of mind, only a few months before the October Revolution of 1917 that shook the world. In the confusion brought about by the misfortunes of the war, the Bolsheviks, led by Lenin and a handful of brilliant and capable individuals seized power of the Russian empire. They were convinced that the process thus set in motion would lead to the creation of a classless society, ending exploitation of man by man, the defining feature of hitherto history. History moves to a preordained pattern, and they were the instruments of history. Under the shock of the revolution, the existing State structure of the gigantic empire had collapsed entirely. Civil war raged over much of Russia, hunger and lawlessness gripped the land. The revolutionary government had no money and the outside world was solidly hostile. Their task was enormous, an undertaking only for men of super-human skills, stamina and courage. For those of us, living our unremarkable prosaic lives, the sheer scope and ambition of the Bolshevik enterprise is mind-boggling. Although the great man in exile despaired of the Russian character, history was to prove him wrong; they were made of sterner stuff.
The mighty land that produced men of the calibre of Lenin and Trotsky, writers with the skills of Tolstoy and Dostoevsky, rulers of the scope of Peter the Great and Empress Catherine, outstanding military men such as Zhukov, Bagration and Kutuzov, brilliant inventors and scientists like Popov and Leontiev is not to be sniffed at. In time, the Soviet Union that Lenin established was to become a superpower , the second most powerful country in the world.( in only thirty years after the revolution)True, all this was achieved at a prohibitive price, as so poignantly exposed subsequently by writers like Solzhenitsyn and Pasternak. Man is not some malleable dough to be kneaded into a historically determined automaton. As it evolved, the ideology that the Bolsheviks so ardently embraced proved to be both false in respect of several of its primary premises as well as oppressive in practice. But that does not take away from the integrity and the passion of the original revolutionaries, who gave their all for a greater cause.
Soviet Union
On June 22, 1941 when the awesome German army crashed into the Soviet Union in a gigantic thrust, most observers expected the Union to collapse in a few months, if not weeks. Within three short months more than three million Soviet soldiers were captured by the relentless German war machine (almost all prisoners were to perish in captivity). The death and destruction that the Germans unleashed on the Soviet Union is unimaginable. In four years of fighting Russia was to suffer Twenty five million dead (equally large numbers were injured or went missing). The titanic struggle for the city of Stalingrad alone, a no holds barred battle that went on for six months, resulted in nearly two million dead, civilians included. But the Russians, despite the fearsome mauling they received, did not lay down their arms. With an enormous sacrifice in blood, toil and tears they stopped the Germans, and thereby surely saved the world from a descend into a long night of barbarism.
For perspective, we may contrast the scale of fighting and the Russian losses with the casualties of our own thirty year war with the LTTE which is said to have resulted in approximately 100,000 casualties in this period. That three decades long struggle nearly unhinged the Sri Lankan State, its political, economic and social structure brought to near breaking point. After the wars successful conclusion it seems we can only refer to it in hyperbolic terms. (The worlds best General fighting the worlds most ferocious terrorist group and so on)
As far as I am aware, Sri Lanka has never caught either Solzhenitsyns imagination or Lenins intellectual attention. We were too far away and too small to be of any interest to the Russian giants. Perhaps, it is for the best. Had a man of Solzhenitsyns sensibilities looked at the thoughts and feelings of any of our leaders, he would assuredly be unable to cover the banality of it all in one small volume!
International forums
I do not know whether there is an undiscovered Sri Lankan Lenin wringing his hands in frustration at the pathetic realities of his country in Zurich or a more welcoming destination for the natives like Dubai or Singapore (Visa on arrival!). Seeing the poor quality of leadership we have produced hitherto, this prospect seems most unlikely (Sri Lankan Lenin in Dubai!)
But during the years when we were flirting with the Socialist block, a story of a particular piquancy did the rounds. Mrs. Srima Bandaranaike (the leader of two thirds of the nations on this earth, as she was described by the government owned newspapers in reference to her purely titular position of the then active non-aligned movement) was Prime Minister (1970-77).
The Soviet Union, grateful for the support given by little Sri Lanka at international forums decided to show its appreciation by asking us to participate in Space exploration, an area where it was dominant at the time. Russia was planning to send a rocket far into Space and thought it appropriate to allow us gift a dog which would be sent in the rocket and thus earn the honour of being the country from where the first dog to travel in Space originated from.
Our government was elated by this show of favour. Immediately a meeting of high powered ministers was called to decide on the selection of the lucky dog. The ministers rushed to Temple Trees, helped along by the pilot cars and armed soldiers who cleared the road for them.
As expected of responsible men of the world, the ministers examined the matter deeply and from different angles, leaving no aspect unexamined. Several meetings were held, many of them till late in the night. Small sub-committees were appointed to look into specific areas. Where should the dog come from, urban or rural How old should it be What kind of name should the dog have Should it have a pedigree How accurate are the records maintained by the Kennel Club in respect of pedigrees Having years of experience in electoral campaigns, the ministers exhibited a comforting familiarity with the substance and nuances of such questions.
Eventually, after prolonged discussions, the matter was resolved, with all ministers unanimously agreeing that a pet owned by a relative of the Prime Minister should be the most appropriate dog to represent the country.
Unlike now, the Foreign Ministry then boasted of much talent. A very senior secretary was tasked with the duty of informing Russia of our achievement.
His message to the Kremlin was brief, in the tone of a party which had done all the hard work.
We have found the dog! Just get the rocket ready!

Mother tongue key symbol of our individual identity - CBK
The 2018 International Mother Language Day celebrations jointly organised by the Bangladesh High Commission, Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages, National Unity and Reconciliation, Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, Sri Lanka Scout Association and university of Visual and Performing Arts was held at the Viharamahadevi Park, Colombo yesterday.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga who was the Chief Guest on the occasion said that, the mother tongue for every human remains her/his first language. All other languages that a person acquires progressively becomes a second language.
For each of us, the mother tongue is the key symbol of our individual identity, the former President said.
Former President Kumaratunga further said that, the mother tongue sparks the most original thinking in an individual. It sparks imagination, creativity and innovation in every child, symbolises ethnic identity, unites members of a community with the pride and self-esteem.
Across villages, towns or metros where we all live-work-advance, multi-lingualism is a fact of life. We must learn to thrive in multi- cultural environment need to learn and grow up respecting the differences in expression, images ,forms, richness of human life asks each of us to understand and celebrate individual identities. Only through the acceptance of the other can we prosper, she added.
In order to foster sustainable development, learners must have access to education in their mother tongue and in other languages. It is through the mastery of the first language or mother tongue that the basic skills of reading, writing and numeracy are acquired. Local languages, especially minority and indigenous, transmit cultures, values and traditional knowledge, thus play an important role in promoting sustainable futures, former President Kumaratunga said.
She further added, While much of peoples original thoughts and actions are shaped and reflected through the mother tongue, we also need to learn foreign languages for a myriad of purposes,the former President said.
Focusing and protecting and promoting the fundamental right of all people, to use their respective mother tongue is crucial. Promoting multi-lingualism is about sustaining a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural nation. Peace stability-harmony-sustainable development within and across societies and nations can only be attained by advancing linguistic and cultural diversity in mutual trust and mutual respect.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganeshan, National Integration and Reconciliation State Minister A.H.M.Fowzie, Bangladesh High Commissioner M.Riaz Hamidullah,Sri Lanka Foundation Institute Chairman Dr.Sarath Kongahage,National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Secretary W.M.P.G.Wickramasinghe and National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary Velayuthan Sivagnanasothy as National Integration and Reconciliation Ministry Secretary were also present.

## Title: MULTILINGUALISM FOR ADVANCED COMMUNICATION
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, February 22, 2018 - 01:00
MULTILINGUALISM FOR ADVANCED COMMUNICATION
Sri Lanka has been a multilingual society from the very beginning of its history. There were, at least, ten languages in use from time to time. For that matter, the Sinhala language itself is the product of multilingualism. It came into being six centuries before the dawn of the Common Era, in our Island kingdom, by the amalgam of, at least, six different languages. What were these languages
1. Vanga
The language used by Prince Vijaya and his seven-hundred followers who came from Vanga. It was a language that belonged to the Indo-Aryan sub-family of the larger Indo-European family. In the course of time, it gave birth to Modern Bengali and Bangla.
2. Language of the Yakkhas
The language used by Princess Kuveni whom Vijaya married. She was a princess of an ethnic group known as the Yakkha. She bore two children, a son and a daughter, and they grew up in a bilingual family, where the father spoke Vanga and the mother spoke the language of the Yakkhas.
3. Language of the Pandus
The language used by the maidens sent from the city of Southern Madura in India. According to our chronicles, Prince Vijaya was requested to marry a maiden of the ksatriya caste and messengers were sent to the city of Southern Madura in India seeking the daughter of the king of Pandus. Seven hundred young maiden were also sent from Madura to be married to Vijayas followers. All these families were also bilingual, because husbands spoke Vanga and their wives spoke the language spoken in Madura.
4. Language of the Rakkhasas
The language used by the ethnic group known as the Rakkhasas, who were considered descendants of King Ravana, the king of Lanka who defeated the Indian king, Rama, as narrated in the Indian epic, Ramayana.
5. Language of the Nagas
The language used by the ethnic group known as the Nagas. Our chronicles record that the Buddha visited the Island to settle a dispute between two Naga kings, Culodaraand Mahodara.
6. Pali
With the introduction of Buddhism in the third century BCE, another Indian language was introduced to the Island. It was called Pali or Magadhi. It was the sacred language of the Buddhists. The Buddha delivered his sermons in Magadhi, the spoken language of the Indian state of Magadha, and Sinhalese monks were well versed in Magadhi, which had by then become the lingua franca of the Buddhist world.
In fact, the word of the Buddha was committed to writing for the first time in Sri Lanka in the first century BCE. Buddhist monks used the Sinhala alphabet to write Magadhi. Pali was used to write commentaries on the Buddhas word, and to compose epics and chronicles. The two main chronicles, Dipavamsa (Island Chronicle) and Mahavamsa (Great Chronicle) were written in Pali.
The Sinhalese king, Kashyapa V, who was well versed in Pali, compiled a Sinhala glossary known as Daham Piya Atuva Gaetapadaya based on the Pali commentary on Dhammapada (Buddhas Words of Wisdom)
Even today Pali is used in all religious rites and rituals in Buddhist temples, in naming Buddhist monks and in naming Buddhist temples. Even during the last days of the Island kingdom, Sinhala Buddhist monks were bilingual, for they used Pali when they communicated with Buddhist monks in Myanmar or Thailand.
7. Sanskrit
The lingua franca of Mahayana Buddhists. While monks of the Mahavihara, the main Theravada monastery at Anuradhapura, the first royal capital of this kingdom, used Pali as their lingua franca, the monks of the Abhayagiri monastery, a centre of Mahayana used Sanskrit.
In the fifth century, the Sinhalese king, Kumaradasa, composed an epic poem in Sanskrit, known as Janakiharana based on the story of Sita (also known as Janaki) as narrated in the Indian epic poem, Ramayana.
King Sena I, who lived in the eighth century, translated the Sanskrit work on poetics, Kavyadarsha of Dandin, into Sinhala verse and called it Siyabas Alankaraya.
8. Prakrit
Prakrit was another Indo-Aryan language studied by Sinhala scholars. It was among the six languages (shad bhasha) that were studied by Sinhala scholars, the others being Sanskrit, Maghadhi, Apabhransha, Paisachi and Sauraseni.
9. Tamil
Tamil, spoken both in India and Sri Lanka, was is use from the earliest times. The island was ruled by many Tamil (Damila) kings, from time to time, beginning from Sena and Guttika, in the second century BCE. The Mahavamsa records this episode thus: Two very powerful Damilas, Sena and Guttika, sons of a horse-shipper, seized Suratissa, the ruler of the earth, and the two of them reigned twenty-two years, justly (Ch. 21, v.10-11) Ten years later, another Damila king, Elara, came into power and ruled the Island for forty-four years. He was considered one of the most righteous kings who ruled our country.
In the sixteenth century, Tamil was considered on par with Pali and Sanskrit. Tamil spoken in Sri Lanka, however, is different from Tamil spoken in Tamil Nadu in India.
10. Portuguese
Portuguese was the first European language that came into contact with Sinhala and Tamil. The Portuguese introduced not only their language but also their religion, the Roman Catholic religion.
11. Dutch
The Portuguese were followed by the Hollanders, who spoke Dutch. During their period many words relating to the Roman-Dutch law came into the Sinhala lexicon.
12. English
English became the official language of the country since 1815 when the Island became a crown colony of the British Empire. It remained so until 1956 when English was replaced by Sinhala. The impact of English was two-fold: First, it left behind a brand of English known as Sri Lankan English. Second, it produced a brand of Sinhala, known as Singirisi, which uses English words in Sinhala structures.
Even though Sinhala and Tamil, collectively known as swabhasha (ones own language or mother language) were made the medium of education, the Tamils were unhappy that their mother language was not given the same official status that was given to Sinhala. This naturally led to political problems, which ultimately ended in a struggle for a separate state. After many years of terrorist war, the mistake was remedied, making Tamil also an official language. Today, English serves as a link language, that brings the two ethnic groups together, until they learn Sinhala and Tamil as second languages.
Bangladesh had to face a somewhat similar experience. As Professor Emeritus Afia Dilsays, The Bengali Muslim leaders had convened and established the Muslim League as a socio-political organization in Dhaka in 1906 to safeguard the interests of the Muslim community. This political party played a leading role in awakening the Muslims throughout India, leading to the Pakistan Movement in 1940, and as a result, the region became East Pakistan province of Pakistan as an independent nation-state in 1947.
But the problems of the region became critically serious because of the over one-thousand mile distance from the capital of the Central Government at Karachi in West Pakistan and, more so, because of some seriously wrong policies of the Government of Pakistan that were seen as a threat to the cultural identity of the people. Their struggle for their rights starting with the Bengali Language Movement soon after independence, but especially after the tragic events of February 21 (called Ekushe), 1952, led to the Bangladesh Movement that resulted in the creation of Bangladesh as an independent nation-state in December 1971. (Bengali Nursery Rhymes, p.13)
National development
Sri Lanka is now in the process of building a new nation where all ethnic groups, the Sinhalese, the Tamils, the Muslims and the Burghers, can live in peace, harmony and integrity. In order to achieve national development, steps have been taken by many institutions to build national unity through mutual understanding among speakers of different languages. Accordingly, a Presidential initiative for a Trilingual Sri Lanka has been launched with a view to spread the competence of the two national languages, Sinhala and Tamil, and the link language, English, among the communities at large.
The task of implementing this programme is in the hands of several ministries, departments and commissions. Among the ministries, the most important is the Ministry of National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages. The compilation of text-books, trilingual dictionaries and glossaries of technical words is in the hands of the Department of Official Languages. Complaints regarding the implementation of the Official Language Policy are handled by the Official Language Commission.

Nature
Nature was made by itself. It is a beautiful form of art and a great thing to study. However, it also has a dark side. These are called natural disasters. These cause severe damage.
Nature has many forms such as the sea, oceans, rivers, mountains, plants, animals, etc. However, men were also formed by Nature. Man-made resources are quickly replacing Natures inventions. Nature is a very important thing. Its is used for our daily needs. Nature comes in several groups-
Waterbodies  Rivers, rain, lakes, seas, ponds, oceans, etc are some waterbodies. Oceans are the largest waterbodies. There are five oceans in the world: the Pacific, the Atlantic, the Indian, the Antarctic and the Artic. The largest is the Pacific and the smallest is the Artic. The longest river is the Nile. The largest is the Amazon. Water is the largest and the only liquid form of Nature. About three-fourths of the Earths surface is covered with water. Water also has many natural disasters such as floods, storms, heavy rainfall, cyclones, etc.
Plants  Plants are the most important forms of Nature. Farmers grow crops for food. Plants give us oxygen. Oxygen is a gas which we breathe. We breathe out carbon dioxide. Plants breathe through leaves. They breathe through tiny pores on their leaves called stomata. They breathe in carbon dioxide. Thats how plants depend on us.
Plants can be as small as an organism to a Giant Redwood Tree. Plants are also very important for animals. Deforestation leads to man-made disasters such as landslides. So plant more trees and protect Nature.
Animals  Animals are the only living creatures which can move and have skin. Animals are found all over the Earth. Animals can be as small as a micro-Protozoa to the largest Blue Whale. Animals like Dolphins, Chimpanzees and Humans are intelligent.
Animals like Deer, Giraffe, Zebra, etc are herbivores. They eat plants. Tigers, Lions, Cheetahs, etc., are carnivores. They eat meat.
Nature is in the threat of disappearing. Sewage water goes to rivers. Plants are cut down to build cities. Animals are killed for their meat. All these factors affect Nature. Man also has to survive, but should not upset the balance of Nature.
We can take action to punish the people who are blindly destroying Nature.

The scores were deadlocked 12-all at half time.
After being contained in the first half the Navy eight came up with a sterling display in the second half to outplay their counterparts in the loose.
Prop forward Charith Silva was a source of inspiration to his team-mates with his fiery loose play and capped a fine performance by scoring two tries in the match.
For the winning Navy SC team the three tries were scored by prop forward Charith Silva (two) and wing three quarter Chathura Gomez (one). The two conversions and the three penalties were fired across by their reliable full back Thilina Weerasinghe.
For Havies their four tries were scored by hooker Shameer Fajudeen (two), flanker Gihan Madusanka (one) and number eight Lasindu Ishan Karunathilake (one). Former Sri Lanka full back Reeza Mubarak put over the three conversions.

Founding of the Small Scale Fisheries Forum of Sri Lanka (SSFFSL):
Out of the murky waters
In the context of high fishing pressure, anthropogenic forces causing resource degradation and depletion, pervasive use of environmentally unfriendly fishing techniques, climate change impacts such as coastal erosion, rising sea levels, multi-stakeholder issues along the coastal belt, unregulated international trade in fish and fish products, unwarranted focus on deep sea fisheries etc., the academics, researchers, the state actors, civil society organisations and community based organisations joined hands on February 14, 2018 to form the Small Scale Fisheries Forum of Sri Lanka (SSFFSL), which is an interactive platform, where all relevant stakeholders will deliberate upon their knowledge, experience and views in resolving issues constraining the sustainable development of Small Scale Fisheries and to propose new avenues of progress and development.
Background
It is now well understood that small-scale fisheries (SSF) make an important contribution to nutrition, food security, sustainable livelihoods and poverty alleviation. However, there are number of issues constraining the sustainable development of this subsector, which need to be properly identified, understood and treated.
Given that small scale fisheries are characterized by fishers operating smaller crafts, fishing in shallower waters, targeting local and domestic markets and home consumption, 93 percent of Sri Lankas 59,000 fishing fleet is engaged in small scale fishing, accounting for 63 percent of the total fish production of the country. The marine fishing population consists of 190,000 households and 221,000 active fishers spread out along the coastline, while another 48,900 fishing households and 54,450 active fishers are engaged in lagoons and inland water bodies. The total fisheries dependent population has been estimated as 2.7 million. Arguably, all of these fishers and people involved in processing and marketing are engaged in the small-scale sector. Small-scale fishers in Sri Lanka are of many kinds. While some are beach-based, others use a variety of crafts  orus (outrigger canoes), kattamarams, theppamsor fibre-glass boats  to ply nearshore, offshore, lagoon or inland fishing grounds. Gears include a broad selection of gillnets, cast nets, long lines, fixed nets and traps. While men generally dominate the harvesting process, women play an important part in processing, marketing and in support activities.
In Sri Lanka, as well as globally, small-scale fisheries are threatened more by anthropogenic pressures coming from both inside and outside the communities, and less by natural factors. High rates of resource exploitation, unregulated technological change, increasing fishing pressure, etc. are causing threats to aquatic ecosystems, leading to resource degradation. It is known that although blue revolution resulted in significant increases in fish catches, it has also resulted in increasing fishing pressure on resources and signs of degradation of resources are quite evident, which compelled the state, as the custodian of the resources, to intervene in protecting the resources from further degradation. However, while state laws deal fairly effectively with the resource crisis, their focus on fisher wellbeing is weak. For fishers who are confronted with declining catches, vulnerability, poverty, and having limited access to livelihood capitals, one option is to use heavy rates of resource exploitation to meet the needs of their families. This is quite understandable, given that poor people use high rates in discounting future gains.
While fisheries cooperatives have played a very important role in the past as a kind of state-community partnerships, providing fishers with livelihood capitals and helping them to cope with vulnerability, many of them collapsed when various governments tried to introduce alternative structures to meet their short term political goals. Today voicing SSF issues on one hand and reaching the target groups on the other, are problematic, due to the existence of parallel community organisations.
There are also voids in fisheries research, which is biased towards ecosystem research rather than research on the human system; the fishing communities. Very little is heard of the issues facing small scale fisheries, although these are of tremendous importance. What we have learnt from research is pre-dominantly scientific; fisheries biology, oceanography, fish diseases, aquaculture, fish population dynamics, etc. with very little focus on small-scale fisheries, especially on small scale fishing communities who are confronted with an array of issues, such as lack of rights, their non-inclusiveness in fisheries decision making, lack of voice, declining catches, declining livelihoods and wellbeing.
On top of the above, climate change is now entering the SSF development equation as an important variable. These impacts are mostly felt in coastal areas, which are to a great extent, inhabited by fishing populations. Sea level rise has caused loss of landing centers, beach seining sites, fish drying sites, displacement of fishing populations, etc. Food chain in marine habitats has been affected with declines in certain species, which has affected fishing landings, production and fishing incomes. Ocean acidification has probably caused disappearance of shell fish such as mussels and lobsters to a certain extent. Lagoon ecosystems are also been affected by sea water intrusion causing a decline in productivity. Wetlands form another resource highly vulnerable to climate change, with loss of habitats, reduced bio-diversity and reduced ecosystem services. Again, climate change research too is science-biased; sea level rise, increasing temperatures, impacts on mangroves and biodiversity, etc., with little focus on the impact of climate change on the social system; the various strategies adopted by people to cope with climate change and the impact of such strategies on their wellbeing. Among many populations, those living in coastal areas confront the highest climate change risks which have very serious implications on the wellbeing of fishing communities who form the most important coastal stakeholder group.
On another front, small-scale fisheries deserve attention due to the opportunities they provide in addressing important societal concerns that exist beyond the sector, such as providing safe and nutritious food and employment. Small scale fisheries is not just catching fish and selling them. SSF is deep rooted in communities, in their cultural heritage, values, etc. making it a way of life; a particular lifestyle that provides both identity and meaning to the lives.
The Blue Print of SSFFSL
Small Scale Fisheries Forum is a platform that is inclusive (all relevant stakeholders), participatory, integrated (all sub-sectors are present) and holistic (looking at fisheries as a component of the coastal ecosystem). For the first time all relevant stakeholders, including the state actors, will sit in resolving societal issues. In fact it is an interactive governance platform, where governance mechanisms are established with the participation of all.
The major objectives of the Forum consist of,establishing platforms to disseminate /share information on SSF, voice the needs of the small scale fishing communities, promote joint research on SSF, to liaise with the government in an advisory capacity to promote government interventions towards sustainable development of small scale fisheries, provide policy inputs to the government, to contribute towards the development, establishment and implementation of a national fisheries policy for Sri Lanka, contribute towards incorporating recommendations of the FAO Voluntary Guidelines to relevant national legislation, policies, strategies as well as to programmes and activities of CSOs/NGOs, and, establishing links with regional and international organisations who are working towards Sustainable SSF.
Future Course of Action
The SSFFSL has two types of goals; Short Term and Long Term.
One of the immediate short term goals is to ensure the implementation of the FAO Voluntary Guidelines for food security and poverty alleviation in Small-Scale Fisheries. These Guidelines, which were developed through a global consultation process by the FAO, capture the inherent features of small scale fisheries by addressing the most compelling issues in SSF, especially, the need to recognize the rights of fishing people and to make the process of fisheries management participatory, inclusive, integrated and holistic with special concern on women and marginalized populations. All efforts made towards sustainable small scale fisheries, especially the Code of Conduct for Responsible Fisheries and SSF guidelines, would be futile unless they are incorporated into the policy making and planning process.
This does not take place automatically. Moreover, they are not blanket recommendations, but guidelines, need to be adopted and/or incorporated into national plans of action depending on specific contexts of countries. Since challenges that SL are facing are also identifiable throughout South Asia and the world, lessons learnt in SL would also provide lessons that go beyond SL, while at the same time SL can benefit from learning about how these challenges are dealt with elsewhere. This requires extending our tentacles beyond national boundaries to establish links with regional and international organisations working for SSF. This is also one key objectives of the SSFFSL.
The second short term goal is to assist the government in preparing the National Fisheries Policy. Even by now the first draft of the policy has been prepared by the government and the SSFFSL is planning to give its fullest assistance in improving the draft policy.
Of the longer term goals, voicing the SSF issues takes priority. In fact this will be a continuous process where SSFFSL will be serving as a mediator/ facilitator in voicing the SSF issues and resolving them, through an interactive process. SSFFSL invites all engaged in SSF to bring their issues to the notice of the SSFFSL (email: [emailprotected]), which will be discussed by the Executive Committee of the SSFFSL for their relevance to SSF development, and suitable action taken.
Another important long term goal would be to establish links with regional and international organisations, which will include (but not limited to), Food and Agriculture Organisation of UN (FAO), International Collective in Support of Fishworkers (ICSF) and Too Big To Ignore (TBTI). The SSFFSL also wishes to organise a Biennial International Small Scale fisheries Congress, as a means of sharing and disseminating information on SSF.
The Office Bearers of the SSFFSL for 2018-2019 are, as follows.

Parliament postpones debate on Bond and PRECIFAC reports
Parliament sittings were confined to about 40 minutes on Tuesday as the House decided to postpone the debate on the Bond Commission and PRECIFAC reports due to the non-availability of English or Tamil translations of the PRECIFAC report.
The decision was after TNA MP M.A.Sumanthiran brought to the notice of the House that the TNA MPs would not be able to participate in the debate as the PRECIFAC report was available only in Sinhala even as at Tuesday.
The adjournment debate on the two reports was a continuation from February 6. As MP Sumanthiran was explaining the House on the language issue faced by them, MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara suggested that he speak on the Bond report which was available in English. This remark developed into a heated exchange of words between the two MPs.
Why are you insisting us to speak only on one report Why are you worried about the PRECIFAC report I wish to speak on that as well. You are worried about us making references to the PRECIFAC report. You were the Minister of National Languages in the previous Government. You should have been protesting in agreement with me that before a debate begins reports must be available in both the national languages, Sumanthiran told Nanayakkara.
You are speaking unnecessarily. My point is that we have come ready to speak and the debate must go on, Nanayakkara retorted to Sumanthiran.
I am not speaking unnecessarily. I cannot even understand if somebody refers to something in the PRECIFAC report. I cannot follow it. Is that the way you want me to participate in a debate Having being the Minister of National Languages, and having gone around the world saying all kinds of things, you are suggesting that I should continue to sit here in a debate where things are referred to in a language that I cannot read. Shameful, Sumanthiran blasted Nanayakkara.
Intervening at this point, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya apologized for not having the Tamil and English translations ready. There are about 8,000 pages in that report. We have asked the authorities to get this translation and the Official Languages Department is working on it. There is a point in what Sumanthiran MP says, but I leave it to the House to decide, said the Speaker asking the opinion of Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella on the matter. Kiriella proposed to postpone the debate observing that legally and technically it was wrong to proceed on the debate without providing the translations.
At this point MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena noted the original agreement was to go ahead with the debate even in the absence of Sinhala and Tamil translations if the English copy was is available. The Speaker clarified that not even the English copy of the PRECIFAC report was ready yet. Thereafter, the Speaker with the consent of the House postponed the debate and adjourned the sittings till 1pm today. The attendance of MPs was also very poor yesterday and many members whose questions were included in the Order Paper were not present to raise their oral questions.

To postpone debate on BC, PRECIFAC reports:I was never under pressure:Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday, said that he was not under any pressure from the Government to postpone the debate on the Bond Commission(BC) and PRECIFAC reports.
He made this clarification when Joint Opposition MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara charged that the Government wanted the debate on the two reports be postponed to avoid any unfavourable situation taking place.He accused that TNA MP M A Sumanthiran raised the language issue at the last moment to get the debate postponed as of the wish of the Government. Why did he not raise the matter of Tamil translation when the House took up the same debate on February 6 Why did he wait until the last minute to communicate that problem he questioned.
Responding to the matter, MP Sumanthiran said he had specifically noted that the TNA would not take part in the debate on February 6 due to the non-availability of translated copies and that they expected the translations be ready when the House resumes the debate on February 20.
MP Nanayakkara is ascribing motives to what I stated and doing so is against Standing Orders. I strongly oppose him ascribing motives to my very valid objection the other day, he added.
The Speaker said the debate was postponed with the consent of the House.
Explosion will be probed: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday, that the Army Commander had notified him that the explosion which occurred in a passenger bus near Kahagolla, Diyatalawa, was due to a grenade explosion.
The Prime Minister said as soon as he heard of the incident, he had called the Law and Order Minister to inquire as to what had exactly happened. However, the Law and Order Minister too did not have the exact details as initial investigations into the incident was being conducted. I found out that the Army was on the scene and was carrying out initial investigations. I spoke to the Army Commander Lt. General Mahesh Senanayake and he notified me that it was a grenade explosion. He said that a grenade could have been in one of the bags carried by a passenger. However, further investigations into the incident is underway, he said.
The Prime Minister said so in response to a question raised in Parliament yesterday, by Joint Opposition member Dinesh Gunawardena regarding the explosion that occurred within a bus plying from Jaffna to Bandarawela carrying Army, Air Force and civilian personnel. As news travels fast through many streams, dont allow this incident to create unnecessary problems in the country and I urge that the correct information be revealed to the country.
Meanwhile the Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake said initial investigations had revealed that it was a grenade explosion. Investigations are continuing and the Government Analyst had also commenced his investigation into the incident. Once investigations are completed, we could reveal more details about the incident, but for now, based on initial investigations, a grenade in a passengers bag had exploded, causing the fire, he said.
Some GMOA officials barely possess three simple passes:Kiriella
Some GMOA officials who clamour for raising the standard of qualifications for medical education as A/ Level qualifications, barely had three simple passes, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He made this comment in Parliament yesterday, in response to a question raised by JVP MP Dr Nalinda Jayatissa. MP Jayatissa pointed out that there had been discussions to make three S passes the minimum qualification to be eligible to study medicine.
It requires three A passes for students in Colombo to qualify to enter State Universities. In Gampaha, this requirement was 1A and 2Bs. We can hardly agree to make the minimum requirement three S passes, at least make it three B passes in order to maintain the required standards of medical education in the country, he said.
Minister Kiriella said there were instances where those who possessed three simple passes had ended up being good doctors. He said among the GMOA officers are doctors who possessed only 3 S passes.
However, he asked the JVP MP to present his proposals on the minimum qualifications for medical education, adding that he was ready to consider them
TNA MPs accused bribery, complains MP Saravanapavan
Raising a privilege issue TNA MP E. Saravanapavan said MP Nadesan Sivashakthi had made a statement that during the Local Government election, the TNA Members of Parliament had accepted a bribe of Rs. 20 million each from the Government in order to support the Budget 2018. This was highlighted in all Tamil newspapers, the electronic media and the social media and all other parties had made use of this during their election campaigns.
He noted that this had resulted in adverse reactions, substantially damaging their reputation. Since this was a privilege issue and it tarnished the image of the elected members, he urged the Speaker to take action against it.
Meanwhile, raising a point of order MP Nadesan Sivashakthi began to speak, but the Speaker refused to give him more time and asked him to sit down. However, despite the Speakers repeated requests and orders to sit down, he continued speaking. The Speaker then threatened to have him sent out of the Chamber unless he took his seat. I am telling for the third time, would you kindly sit down or go out of the Chamber, the Speaker retorted.
Then raising a point of order, TNA member M.A. Sumanthiran said, The member raised a question of privilege and in the question of privilege, he made a complaint against another member.
Merely because he made a complaint, that member could not say that his name had been mentioned and start speaking.
Therefore, he moved that whatever MP Sivashakthi said in response to the privilege issue raised by MP Saravanapavan be expunged from yesterdays proceedings, to which the Speaker agreed and said he would look into it.

Most Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera:
Pious bhikku who stood for justice
Most Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera of the Sri Lanka Ramanna Maha Nikaya was a pious, erudite Buddhist monk who endeared himself to the people by standing for justice and fair play and by rendering a great socio-religious service to the country.
Born in 1938 in Girambe, Kurunegala, he had 10 siblings; two brothers and eight sisters. His father was an ayurvedic physician at Girambe. Two each of his brothers and sisters predeceased him.
At the age of three, he learnt his first letters from Ven. Mathgamuwe Pannasekara Nayake Thera of the Polgahawela Vijayananda Pirivena. At the age of five, he was admitted to the Rathmalgoda Maha Vidyalaya, where he studied up to grade two. Ven. Siyambalanduwe Kassapa Thera who was one of his uncles, used to frequent their house and had once asked him whether he wished to enter the bhikku order, for which he had answered in the affirmative. With the approval of his parents, he was taken to the Peradeniya Sarananda Pirivena on January 1, 1949, by Ven. Kassapa Thera and handed over to the charge of Chief Incumbent Ven. Siyambalangamuwe Gunaratana Nayaka Thera. The Peradeniya Sarananda Pirivena was then known as the Wijayawardenaramaya.
Nine months later, he was ordained as a samanera bhikkhu under the preceptorship and tutelage of Ven. Siyambalangamuwe Gunaratane Nayake Thera. After receiving higher ordination under the tutelage of Ven. Siyambalangamuwe Gunaratane Nayake Thera, at the initiative of the Kurunegala Sangha Sabha of the Sri Lanka Ramanne Maha Nikaya, he moved residence to the Yodagama Asokaramaya in Rambukkana, where he stayed from 1958 to 1960 and made a great contribution to the development of the temple.
Ven. Girambe Ananda Anunayake Thera shot to fame after moving on to the Anuradhapura Sri Sarananda Maha Pirivena, which he then transformed into a great seat of learning and renowned centre for religious and social service. He was instrumental in building houses for the benefit of seven underprivileged families with contributions from his devotees.
He also looked into the needs of daham pasalas in the area on an annual basis. A Vesak perahera launched by him in 2002 as an annual feature in Anuradhapura, had to be wound up after two years due to political intervention at the time. Nevertheless, he was able to revive it last year.
Ven. Girambe Ananda Thera was instrumental in conducting 14 danselas each year to cater to Buddhist devotees flocking to Anuradhapura for Vesak, Poson, and Esala Poyas. A Young Men's Buddhist Association formed by him was instrumental in setting up more than seven other temples in Anuradhapura. The Sarananda Pirivena caters to people of all communities, and Tamil language classes are a special feature of its syllabus.
He was also instrumental in saving the lives of nearly 100 Tamil families during the 1983 communal riots by giving them refuge at the Sarananda Pirivena and feeding them for several months before they could safely return to their homes.
The Ven. Thera also travelled abroad widely and engaged in dhammaduta activities in India, Germany, France, Austria, Nepal, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand.
Ven. Ananda Thera once recalled that his higher education prospects were hampered due to his involvement in politics during the 1965 general election.
A forthright bhikku who always stood for justice and fair play, he even went to court to overcome obstructions caused to his pirivena by the provincial political big wigs at the time.
He was a true Buddha putra who extended love and compassion to all, including friend and foe alike. He headed a chain of 33 pirivenas and viharayas which catered to nearly 250 bhikkhus. May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

Case against Alles, three others:
Preliminary objections overruled
The Colombo High Court yesterday decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by former MP Tiran Alles and three others in connection with a Rs.200 million fraud that had allegedly taken place at the RADA in 2006.
While overruling preliminary objections raised by the defence, High Court Judge Vikum Kaluarachchi fixed the matter for trial to be heard in due course. The case is to be taken up again on March 23.
On a previous occasion, President's Counsel Romesh de Silva with Nalin Ladduwahetty PC appearing for Tiran Alles alleged that prosecutors have failed to follow the provisions of the Evidence Ordinance when dealing with computer evidence.
However, Additional Solicitor Yasantha Kodagoda PC appearing for the Attorney General had raised a primary counter objection citing it was premature to raise this objection since the prosecution has not taken a decision to call computerized evidence at this juncture.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against four accused - former Chairman of RADA Tiran Alles, former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, former Chief Operating Officer (COO) of RADA Saliya Wickramasuriya and Dr. Jayantha Dias Samarasinghe in connection with the controversial RADA fraud.
The High Court had allowed the Attorney General to proceed with the controversial RADA case in absentia of former North and Eastern Provinces LTTE Financial Head Emil Kanthan, the second accused in the case.
The second accused, Emil Kanthan, is currently evading courts and the Colombo Special High Court had also issued an open warrant for his arrest in connection with the attempted murder of former Minister Douglas Devananda.

When considering the historic architectural creations, our country is home to a number of marvellous architectural creations. This is clearly visible when one looks at the archaeological wonders of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa and Sigiriya, Minister Ranawaka said.
The Minister further said that Sri Lanka is on the way of becoming a developed nation. He added that within the next few years, the country will require 50,000 housing units in Colombo and the suburbs.
It has been estimated that there will be a huge demand for 50,000 housing units in a few years. Moreover, there will be a huge demand for office spaces in and around Colombo, he said.

FROM REAL TO REEL!
He dubs filmmaking as his profession, passion, vision and everything! Other matters else in life falls in second place for Los Angeles-based director, producer, cinematographer, and screenwriter of Sri Lankan origin Lakpathy Wijesekara.
His entrance to the digital arena happened at a young age when he got the opportunity to act in Sellam Gedara and Kopi Kade. He was equally intrigued about what was going on behind the cameras and at one point he had actually requested Lakshman Maththumagala of the Independence Television Network (ITN) to let him direct Sellam Gedara.
Trying to capture some footage at a busy intersection
I was 12 then. Maththumagala said no for obvious reasons but then I produced my first piece of work with a handheld consumer camera and edited it on Windows Movie Maker. The saying Ive all the demons of hell in my head. My only salvation is to vent them on paper included in Philip Kaufmans 2000 American-British-German period film Quill goes with me as well. The imagination in my head was endless so I found film to be a great media to express them, Lakpathy recalled the roots of his passion with a smile.
His stint at Royal College, Colombo, honed his talents. He was the President of the Sinhala Literary Association and the head of The Royal College Video Team. He pioneered the Le Royale Youtube Channel which covered hundreds of events at school.
One problem that I observed at school was that when the event was over, the energy and time we invest as students, in organising all the creative, sports or social service activities, boiled down to memories alone. Le Royale Youtube Channel was the largest project that I handled during my days as a Royalist. This was during the early days of Youtube when only a few people knew about media platforms. Youtube wasnt even part of Google at that time. My creative solution to the problem was to create an online video archive so that we can refresh those beautiful memories and live those beautiful moments over and over again. There are a lot of sports, clubs, societies and social services based events at Royal College. We covered virtually all the events which flooded the school calendar : Arts days, Science days, cricket matches, choir events etc. We filmed the events during the day, edited them and uploaded them on Youtube overnight. We were also able to live stream rugby and cricket matches to fans all around the world, Lakpathy explained.
By the end of his senior years he and his team had uploaded more than 345 videos to Youtube. He had also done around 40 live streams.
I didnt carry a school bag those days. Instead I carried a 20llb camera bag to school alone. I was surrounded by a group of friends that had the film bug .They are still continuing their careers in the creative arts fields. We kind of made our own film school with Le Royale: teaching, guiding, managing and leading my bunch of likeminded colleagues, he enthused.
He had directed two stage dramas Kalathra Yathra and High School Musical. Kalatra Yathra won the awards for the best director and best script along with three other awards at the Royal College Inter House Drama Festival. He also produced the short films titled Locked, Hello and Another Day. Locked was screened at the Boomtown Film Festival, Winchester UK and the Atlanta Shortsfest, Atlanta Geogia, USA in 2015. His feature films are Behind the Scenes and One Star Rider. Behind The Scenes was screened in the International Childrens Film Festival in Lucknow, India, in 2011. The webseries Rydeshare Chronicles was screened at the Chinese Theater In Hollywood for the Indi Night Film Festival in 2016. It also represented the VanChan Film Festival in Vancouver, Canada and the Aab International Film Festival in India. Lakpathy was also the scriptwriter and the executive producer of the Sri Lankan- American joint film production Api.
Queried on what inspired him in his projects, Lakpathy notes that he is moved by heroes who fail several times over.
Scenes from One Star Rider
Every time they fail, they get up, dust them off and keep on trying until they achieve their goal one day. That is the difference between a hero and an ordinary person. I was always a huge fan of Hollywood and British films. I used to go to the British Council and the American Cultural Center at least twice a week to pick up some DVDs to watch, he said.
My definition of success is making the most of who you are with what you have got. We did our web series Rydeshare Chronicles only using a mobile phone camera. Film is a universal art, going beyond language, geopolitical and cultural barriers. I try to do the justice to the story when I make a movie wherever I am. I dont believe in the practice of inserting Sri Lankanness into each and every film simply because I am a Sri Lankan.
I usually hid the name of the director until the very end of the film, even during my school days at UCLA since I wanted to watch the audiences reaction without knowing who directed it. I envision an audience filled with global citizens, he noted.
Speaking about the challenges he faced in the industry Lakpathy says that the United States of America that he has seen in the movies and the real America are very different.
I never imagine America to be such a diverse place of culture and people judging from the films I have watched. However, there arent many movies made on African Americans, Asian Americans, Sri Lankan Americans or Hispanics. Its very difficult to make movies out of those stories, he said.
Lakpathy is into talking head movies. He says that though filmmaking is a visual medium, he is a fan of heavy dialog movies. Filmmakers like Joe Wright (Pride and Prejudice, Atonement) Jason Reitman (Juno) Aaron Sorkin (The Social Network, Steve Jobs) Christopher Nolan (Momento, Dark Night) And Quentin Tarantino (Dejango, Hurtful Eight) and Robert Rodriguez (Desparado, Sin Ciy) are some of his favourites.
Seasoned film journalist Aruna Gunarathna once told him that he enjoyed his films because they were genuine and advised him not to lose that quality. Therefore Lakpathy always tries to stick to Gunarathnas words of wisdom.
I also remember Hollywood film maker Robert Rodriguezs comment Sometimes you are not the guy who wins the race. You are the one who set phase for someone else to win at a guest lecture. I think this is a very good lesson, not only for the film industry, but also in other matters in life! he mused.
He had watched and closely studied all the recent Sri Lankan films.
In comparison to the many talented individuals that I had the privilege of working with from around the world, technical crews in Sri Lanka are talented or in some cases better than many people that I work with in Los Angeles. We have great camera people, great editors, great actors, but in my opinion, our industry is where it is today because of our terrible screenplays! There is not enough passion, interest, priority or importance put into writing and crafting our screenplays. Its simply impossible to make a good film with a bad script, no matter whether it is in Sri Lanka, Hollywood, or Bollywood. I am very confident that we if we can craft the art of writing a screenplay properly, not only we can restore the Sri Lankan film industry, but also can have a significant presence in Bollywood, Hollywood and beyond, Lakpathy opined.
Lakpathys father was a businessman while his mother was a Science teacher who taught at Ladies College and Vidyakara Vidyalaya, Maharagama.
He says that his mother was his source of inspiration while his father was his source of creativity and entrepreneurship. His brother, Dr Novil Wijesekara is a doctor attached to the Ministry of Health, working in the field of disaster management and public health.
He is working on the post production stages of One Star Rider. He also has two scripts in development. One is in Hindi and the other has generated some interested from some Hollywood A-Listers.
He quotes American film director, screenwriter and cinematographer Peter Hyams words  If you are not prepared to be rejected , dont try to make film, write film, direct film or act in film because you are going to be rejected as his words of wisdom for aspiring young filmmakers.
It is very different from becoming a doctor, a lawyer or an engineer. There are no set of instructions to follow or one way to get there. It is an adventurous and risky path worth exploring. Being rejected is a part of it.
If you are ready to be rejected, yet could keep on continuing your journey towards your goal, then you are ready to take up filmmaking. You got here, so you will get there! he said.
He says that until recent times his primary goal had been focused on winning an Oscar.
I know this is not an easy task for a Sri Lankan filmmaker to even to dream of. Yes, I am still passionate about winning an Oscar, however, I have realized that making movies to win awards is a mundane thing. Now my goal is to stay true to my values and make authentic movies that people can enjoy beyond geographical, economical and cultural boundaries while returning the investment plus an interest to my producers.
Awards and recognition are just by products of this process. So yes, along the way, If I can win some awards, thats great, he concluded with a smile.

Remove apparel quota to India - Exporters
Sri Lanka Apparel Exporters Association Chairman Felix Fernando requested the Indian government to either improve the existing apparel quota system to a sizable amount or remove it.
This will give the Sri Lankan apparel exporters more confidence in doing business in the Indian subcontinent, he said.
Since quota restrictions have been imposed, we can export only a certain quantity.The existing apparel quota is not sufficient enough for largescale Sri Lankan apparel manufactures to export to the Indian market and it is pertinent to remove these existing impediments to create win opportunities for both countries.
Fernando was speaking at the inauguration of India International Textiles Expo 2018 Exhibition and Cum Buyer Seller Meet, taking place from February 21 to 23 at Hotel Galadari, Colombo.
Noting that Sri Lankan apparel exports have grown significantly, registering a 6% growth over the last six months, Fernando expressed hope that the current trend would continue in the coming months as well.
Sri Lanka currently exports fabrics and other materials from several ASEAN countries including China which are not eligible to receive the GSP Plus benefit.
Fernando also stressed the need to come up with a proper mechanism that would ultimately help Sri Lankan manufactures to obtain required fabrics and materials from India rather than importing from several ASEAN Countries.
But unfortunately, current issues need to be sorted out if we need to get more and more fabrics from India.
Speaking at the event, Special Assignments Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said, the apparel quota was given not with the idea of restricting, it was given with the idea of stimulating trade.
Today, that objective is not necessarily the utmost. Weve done very well and were now ready to compete. This is an area where we can work together.
Apparel is very sensitive product to India given its own apparel industry, the Minister said adding that removing or improving the existing quota wouldnt affect the vastness of the Indian market , but it would certainly be a nice gesture for a country like Sri Lanka.
India International Textiles Expo 2018 Exhibition and Cum Buyer Seller Meet is organized by power loom Development and Export Promotion Council of India (PDEXCIL). More than 35 Indian textile manufacturer-exporters are showcasing Indian fabrics, made-ups, home textiles in various blends and designs, during the exhibition.

Sharma plays a  double role in  Pari
After showing off her calibre in two of her home production NH10 and Phillauri, Anushka Sharma is back with her third venture Pari. Her character and look in this upcoming horror film has had audience hooked in anticipation.
Although not much is known about her character in the film and the storyline, if the trailer and screamers are anything to go by, Anushka seems to be playing a double role in the film.
While we wait with bated breath to find that out, we managed to get some details about her character and her look. Speaking about the same, British Prosthetic designer Clover Woottoon stated, There are many shades to Anushkas character in Pari. But, most importantly, we wanted people to forget Anushka the person, and think about Rukhsana (her character) alone.
Anushka being a strikingly pretty face, we didnt do too much with her. We just made her eyebrows bushier, added lenses and darkened the under eyes so that she looked more tired.
We blurred the edge of her lips so that it looks drier and that is literally all that we did. Depending on the scene requirements we made her cheeks a little pinker but thats about itnothing more was done and yet, she looked so different! Pari is slated to release on March 2. TNN

Shipping leaders push for new maritime authority
Several leaders in the maritime field said this week that Sri Lanka should set up a streamlined government body to seize the islands potential as a global shipping hub.
We are a country of missed opportunities, said Admiral Jayanath Colombage, former Chief of the Sri Lanka Navy, at a seminar hosted by the Ceylon Association of Shipping Agents at the Galadari Hotel onTuesday. We understand where we need to be, but we dont do anything.
That is why 70 years (after Independence) we are where we are today, he added. Time and tide wait for no man.
Admiral Colombage said Sri Lankas ports needed to be increasingly digitized in order to compete with the rest of the world.
He pointed out that Sri Lankas ease of doing business ranking, published by the World Bank, was 111. For comparison, Mauritius, another small island nation, ranked 25.
He also advocated for better shipbuilding and repair services, marketing Sri Lanka as a flag of convenience, and more efficient communication between government agencies.
We have too many agencies dealing with the ocean, and every agency is working in a water-tight compartment, he said.
Sri Lanka Ports Authority Chairman Parakrama Dissanayake agreed.
We need to have a maritime promotion bureau, which is un-politicized, he said. Like the tourism promotion bureau, the industry should agitate.
The idea of a powerful maritime body that could deal with strategy, branding, and management of Sri Lankas ports emerged in multiple experts speeches.
We are talking about a global maritime hub, but who is doing it asked Captain Ranjith Weerasinghe, the Chairman and Managing Director of Freedom of Highseas. Who is in charge of a maritime hub This country goes on without a compass.
We need an apex body named the Sri Lanka Maritime Authority, he said. He gave the recent example of the Sri Lanka Ports Authority and the Immigration Department wrestling for jurisdiction over which body is supposed to issue landing permits to incoming sailors.
There needs to be one body to look after things like this, he said.
A maritime authority, he argued, could streamline regulations for everything that we do within the maritime hub.
It is part of the governments Vision 2025 to make Sri Lanka the trading hub of the Indian Ocean. The panelists argued that political leaders needed to act fast before the opportunity slips away.
We need leaders who have maritime affinity, and a vision, said Admiral Colombage.
If not Sri Lanka will only be aspiring to be a maritime hub in the 22nd century as well.

SLIIT Walk 2017 helps raise funds for IT education in rural schools
SLIIT Walk 2017 was held for the 6th consecutive year, organized by the Student Interactive Society under the theme Strides for Hope and helped to bring together the student community and the staff, promoting the institutes interactive culture.
The SLIIT Walk 2017 was a successful fund-raiser and helped to collect Rs. 1.16 million. The funds were raised with the specific objective of utilizing them to uplift the quality of life of underprivileged children in line with SLIITs vision as an educational institute, of disseminating knowledge to young people. This years sizable collection was used to upgrade the IT labs of two selected schools in Ratnapura and Badulla districts.
The school in Ratnapura is Amuhenkandha Sri Wimalasara Maha Vidyalaya, Eheliyagoda, with over 1000 students and classes from grade 1 to 13. The school currently has an IT Lab with only four working PCs but with sufficient space for 15 more PCs.
The other school that benefited is Konthahela Vidyalaya, Pattiyagedara, in Bandarawela with a student population of 288. The school has classes from grade 1 to 11 and more than 150 students learn IT facilitated by only one working PC. The contribution from the SLIIT Walk 2017 will enable the school to have much needed PCs, two fans, tables and chairs.
Students from both schools were unable to have an effective IT education due to the lack of IT facilities and the funds raised by the SLIIT Walk 2017 made a difference by uplifting the lives of these children. Empowering the youth in rural schools with IT education will enhance their employment prospects and help make their future brighter while supporting the government in its endeavour to reduce poverty and illiteracy in rural Sri Lanka.
Prof. Samantha Thalijjagoda, Dean of SLIIT Business School said As an educational institute, SLIIT takes pride in empowering rural youth as a result of the annual walk that has raised a commendable amount of funds that would go a long way in upgrading IT education in two rural schools. This endeavour will also motivate our students to focus seriously on the need to help the community they live in and help to make them worthy citizens that benefit the nation.
Vice President of Student Interactive Society, Mihiran Weerathunga said SLIITs farsighted vision is to ensure that Sri Lanka benefits from Information Technology, Business Management and Engineering by promoting research and development as well as software services, nurturing IT ventures, thus ensuring a valuable pool of experts in the future.

Tax concessions for lands provided on long term lease basis for agricultural purposes
Cabinet approval has been granted to provide tax concessions for lands provided on a long term lease basis for agricultural purposes.
A Cabinet Paper presented by Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake proposed that in order to promote agriculture, it was necessary that lease concessions for such land.
At present, when lands are requested for agricultural projects, if the proposed agricultural project has commercial objectives, the normal procedure is to alienate lands on a commercial basis.
Thus the new lease concession system below proposes that tax concessions be directly given on the basis of agriculture.
The following was approved in terms of concessions:
Suspend the recovery of the premium calculated as equal to triple of the annual lease recovered once and for all, when alienation is made under the State Land Ordinance No 8 of 1947.
Calculate the lease revision by addition of 20 percent to the lease of the previous year, instead of the present revision of 50 percent affected once in five years.
Calculate the initial lease of the second lease period by addition of 20 percent to the lease charged at the end of the lease period in case of extending the lease period upon completion of the first lease period.
Reduce the annual lease rate from 4 percent to 2 percent effective from the date of receiving the approval of the former Minister to alienate the lands on the long term lease, when the assessed value of the land is less than Rs.5,000,000.
The Progress Review Meeting of Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
The Progress Review Meeting to examine the progress of the projects and of future development plans conducted under the Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment was held under the patronage of the President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday at the Mahaweli Development Ministry Auditorium.
Detailed discussions were held regarding the special development plans conducted under Ministry of Mahaweli Development where President Sirisena stressed on the importance of improving the efficiency and regularising the projects towards providing quick benefits to the Mahaweli farmer community.
The President also emphasised the importance of conducting proper studies on possible dry weather conditions in the future and plan management of water levels of reservoirs accordingly and inform the farmers to manage their cultivations in the future on the basis of such forecasts. He instructed the officials to launch such awareness campaigns through farmer organizations.
The attention was also drawn on the construction of Wayamba Cannel and the upper Elahara Canal projects and instructions were given to speed up the construction works at Madirigiya, Bisopura village under the Moragahakanda Project and distribution of lands to the displaced persons expeditiously.

UNP, UPFA endorse Unity Government
The National Government formed by the UNP and the UPFA is intact and will be continued, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and UPFA General Secretary and Minister Mahinda Amaraweera confirmed in Parliament yesterday.
Making a ministerial statement on the request of the Speaker, to clarify on the continuation of the National Government, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told the House that the Resolution passed on September 3, 2015 to give effect to National Government is still valid.
We have not rescinded the Resolution. It is still operative. There is no set of circumstances yet that we have to cancel it, the PM asserted.
Speaking after the PM, the UPFA General Secretary also confirmed Parliament that the UPFA still abides by the initial agreement signed between the two parties to work in a National Government. We have not withdrawn from it, he said.
The members in the Government benches thumped their desks expressing their pleasure over the official clarifications on the continuation of the National Government. Upon the request of the PM, Secretary General of Parliament Dhammika Dassanayake read out the Resolution passed by Parliament on September 3, 2015 to the House for clarity.
However, Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Dissanayake and Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena argued that the MoU between the UNP and SLFP which led to the formation of the National Government specifically stated that it was for two years and any extension should have been approved by Parliament. MP Dissanayake argued that the Government violated the Constitution in the last four months by maintaining a Cabinet of Ministers exceeding 30 after the expiration of the MoU.
The PM responding to the argument said the Government acted in line with the provision 46 (4) of the Constitution and signing an MoU between the two parties or producing such a document to Parliament is not mandatory as per the Constitution.
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha pointed out that both parties, who are privy to the agreement, have expressed their desire to continue in National Government and that per se is sufficient in terms of 46 (4) of the Constitution.
The agreement between the parties could be in writing or oral.Third parties cannot intervene in this matter, he added.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena maintained that the MoU was the base for the Parliamentary Resolution and therefore any renewal or changes to that document must be informed to Parliament.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera pointed out the Resolution passed by Parliament nowhere said that it was valid only for two years.Agreeing to this point MP Dissanayake however said the Resolution was meant to increase the number of Cabinet Ministers from 30 to 48 and the number of Deputy and State Ministers from 40 to 45.
The Resolution was subsequent to the agreement of the two parties to work in a National Government. In the same manner you read out the Resolution, ask the Secretary General to read out the letter to the Speaker by then UPFA General Secretary late Wiswa Warnapala. It specifically states that the National Government is for two years. President Maithripala Sirisena, who addressed the House soon after the formation of National Government, said that exercise for consensual governance is for two years.
The PM at one time told the House that National Government is limited to two years. If you want to extend it further you must duly inform the House and get its approval, Dissanayake argued.
The PM responding to the query noted the only document before the House on the day Parliament approved the formation of National Government was the Resolution presented by him.
An MoU of the two parties is not mandatory and we signed it because this whole exercise was a new experience for us. National Governments existed in the UK Parliament in 1916, 1931 and 1940, but a written document was not available for any of them. That is the tradition, he clarified.
JO MP Udaya Gammanpila said the absence of written agreement could set a bad precedence that the future PMs could exploit to increase the number of ministers in the guise of a National Government. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya finally stated that he stands by the official positions communicated to the House by the Prime Minister and the UPFA Secretary General on the continuation of National Government.
He said the UPFA, SLFP and UNP have confirmed him that they continue to work in National Government.
The Speaker however said he would look into other pertaining issues raised by the members.
SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake was also present in the House.

Worlds fasted 4x4 SUV Lamborghini to be in SL soon
Worlds fastest 4x4 SUV Lamborghini Urus is to be launched in Colombo by Micro Cars soon.
The principals of the company will be in Colombo to plan this launch.
An official from Micro Cars said that in the recent past many top end cars have are entering, Sri Lanka which included, Rolls-Royce, Bentley, Maybach, Maserati, Porsche McLaran, Ferrari, Tesla, MB, BMW, Lexus, Audi etc.
With the entry of these exotic brands to Sri Lanka which have high taxes have helped Sri Lanka Custom Department to earn higher revenue as well with smaller number of vehicles to handle.
Franchisees and most importantly Vehicle lovers too benefit from these new arrivals. This will certainly lead to change the future lifestyles of vehicles and it seems that Sri Lankans are now moving from the age old top brands to exotic brands.
