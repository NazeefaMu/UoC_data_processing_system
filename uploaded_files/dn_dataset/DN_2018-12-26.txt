Bethlehem boasts largest Christmas in years
WEST BANK: Pilgrims from around the world flocked to Bethlehem on Monday for what was believed to be the Biblical West Bank city's largest Christmas celebrations in years.
Hundreds of locals and foreign visitors milled in Manger Square as bagpipe-playing Palestinian Scouts paraded past a giant Christmas tree. Crowds flooded the Church of the Nativity, venerated as the traditional site of Jesus's birth, and waited to descend into the ancient grotto.
Palestinian Tourism Minister Rula Maaya said all Bethlehem hotels were fully booked, and the city was preparing to host an "astounding" 10,000 tourists overnight.
"We haven't seen numbers like this in years," she said, adding that the 3 million visitors to Bethlehem this year exceeded last year's count by hundreds of thousands.
Solemn-faced nuns and enthused tourists crossed themselves and bowed over their rosaries as they entered the church, the air thick with incense. Linda Selbmann, 24, of Chemnitz, Germany, said she had long dreamed of celebrating Christmas in Bethlehem.
"It's wild to be in the place it all began," she said, sipping Turkish coffee in front of a statue of the Virgin Mary cradling the infant Jesus.
The Christmas festivities traditionally bring a boost of holiday cheer to Christians in the Holy Land, whose numbers have shrunk over the decades relative to the general population and now make up just a minority.
As the sun set on Manger Square, the enormous Christmas tree lit up and the city's ancient passageways shone with colored string lights and flashing crosses. Choirs sang classic carols and hymns, their voices echoing throughout the plaza. Palestinian youths peddled Santa hats to tourists and shop windows bearing signs reading "Jesus Is Here" displayed olivewood Nativity scenes and other souvenirs.
Archbishop Pierbattista Pizzaballa, the top Roman Catholic cleric in the Holy Land, entered Bethlehem after crossing an Israeli military checkpoint from Jerusalem.
At a midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity, Pizzaballa addressed a packed house of worshippers and dignitaries that included Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah.
Pizzaballa said the recent restoration of the church was a metaphor for recent events in the region.
"The mosaics were splendid, but covered by a layer of dirt," he said at the start of his homily.
"This last year was terrible," said Pizzaballa, referring to the upsurge in violence between Israelis and Palestinians, "so we all tend to think that all is dirty. But if you remove this layer of dirt we see how wonderful the mosaics are."
"Since it's Christmas, we have to be positive," the archbishop said.
Palestinian security personnel and vehicles stationed around the square reminded visitors that amid the merriment, they couldn't quite escape the city's political reality. Bethlehem is located in the Palestinian-controlled area of the West Bank, and much of the city lies behind Israel's separation barrier.
"Last year things were worse because the injustice was so obvious," said Maaya, the tourism minister, referring to U.S. President Donald Trump's decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, incensing the Palestinians and igniting clashes. "But this year doesn't feel so different. We are still occupied, and we always have problems," she said.
Monjed Jadou, a Bethlehem resident, said that although he noticed an impressive number of foreigners in the square, the crowds of Palestinian visitors appeared thinner than usual.
"Security is tighter around here than it's been in a while, and the streets feel less safe. I think people are afraid," he said, adding that his friends from the West Bank city of Ramallah decided not to come because the Israeli army had been blocking roads around the city.
The West Bank has seen a spike in violence in recent weeks, set off by a pair of deadly shootings targeting Israeli soldiers and settlers claimed by the Islamic militant group Hamas. Israel has ratcheted up security at checkpoints as it presses on with its manhunt for suspected Palestinian assailants.
Other visitors seemed unconcerned by recent violence in the area.
"This has been No. 1 on my bucket list," said Yohannes Denu, 42, of Los Angeles. "There's no better place to be as a Christian, it takes me back to all the rich stories I heard growing up. To be at the center of my faith, it's joyous, it's unbelievable."
In anticipation of the midnight Mass at the Church of the Nativity, the climax of Christmas Eve celebrations, Palestinians and pilgrims huddled in groups, some singing "Silent Night" and carrying candles.
"This is a day of celebration," Maaya said. "And we have hope that one day we'll be able to celebrate like everyone else."- ABC NEWS

Cabinet to select MRs Secretary
Cabinet is expected to consider the nominee for the post of Secretary to Mahinda Rajapaksa as Leader of Opposition on January 2, despite confusion over the post of Opposition Leader.
The former Presidents spokesperson Rohan Welivita told the Daily News yesterday that a Leader of the Opposition needed to send in the name of an SLAS officer to Cabinet to be considered to be appointed as Secretary to the Leader of the Opposition.
We have done that and we expect a positive decision on it, he said. If the name is approved by Cabinet, it would effectively mean that the government has recognised Rajapaksa as the new Leader of the Opposition.
He added that they hoped to be able to occupy the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Marcus Fernando Mawatha, Colombo 7 by the first week of January 2019.
On December 21, Mahinda Rajapaksa sat at the Constitutional Council meeting in his capacity as the Leader of the Opposition with the Prime Minister.So we will be able to settle this matter soon,Welivita said. TNA Leader R.Sampanthan in the meantime has stated that he was still the Leader of the Opposition and continues to occupy the Office of the Leader of the Opposition in Colombo 7. The Speaker last week deferred his decision on the matter after receiving requests from UNP and TNA Parliamentarians who asked for a Parliament Select Committee to be appointed to look into the matter.
Parliament is to reconvene on January 8.Attempts made to contact the TNA leader and his office yesterday for a comment proved unsuccessful.

Citizens' Mail
Non-displaying of assessment numbers
Nearly 45 % of the house owners, whether they are rich or poor, in the Colombo City have not displayed their Assessment Numbers on their doors, gates or the walls.
This has been going on for many years and it is time that they are compelled to display their house numbers.
Because messengers, deliverers and the likes of both the private and public sectors find very difficult to trace addresses when such deliveries are to be made.
Sometimes, postmen serving a particular area too find difficult to trace an address. And when transfers are made the new postmen face more difficulties to make their deliveries.
Taking these into consideration the postal department should compel every owner or occupier of a house to display the number of their premises at least in 2-inch sizes. Now simply requesting them to do so will not bring any result.
The postal department should make an announcement that numberless premises should number them within two weeks.
If failed, delivering of letters would be stopped to such premises until it is attended.
The Post Master General should make necessary arrangements in this regard for the good of his postmen and the public as well.

Commission of Inquiry Act awaits Parliament sanction
Bribery Commission (CIABOC) Director General, Sarath Jayamanne PC yesterday hoped that Parliament would take up the proposed amendments to the Commission of Inquiry Act soon to quicken the pace of investigations into Presidential Commission Inquiry reports.
CIABOC Commissioner, Justice W.L.R.Silva at the First Implementation Review Cycle of the United Nations Convention Against Corruption (UNAC) in September this year said there are over 30 Commission reports in CIABOC which need investigation.
Jayamanne told the Daily News that according to the existing Act, CIABOC had no power under the existing law to look into Presidential Commission of Inquiry reports and to consider evidentiary material in them to file cases against those charged.
If we were to file a case, we have to re-summon all the witnesses in all the cases. It affects investigations, witnesses can change their statements and it would be hugely time consuming causing further delays, Jayamanne said.
Amendments to the Commission of Inquiry Act had thus proposed to empower CIABOC to directly use evidence from Presidential Inquiry reports to file cases against suspects, save time and remove the need to keep summoning witnesses all over again.
Amendments have been approved by the Legal Draftsman, the Attorney Generals Office and the Parliament Oversight Committee on the subject.It was taken up for debate on two days and only four speakers spoke but later postponed, the Director General said.
It was to be taken up for debate in Parliament on October 25 but it was postponed again. No date for it has been fixed as of yet, he added.
CIABOC in the meantime is also expected to introduce proposed amendments to all its Acts including the CIABOC Act and Asset Declaration Act in its National Action Plan in the next two months.
Amendments to the Asset Declaration Act in particular is proposed to introduce an online system for government officers to update their financial records whenever a large income or expenditure is, instead of annual submission within 15 days of the transaction, Jayamanne said.
It also proposes to set up a Central Authority at CIABOC for collection and verification of Asset Declaration information and once verification of information is done it would alert the commissioners of any suspicious activity.

Family without way out seeks help
A family of six living in a shanty house in Talawa, Hitigollagama needs assistance.
The breadwinners of the family, father and mother, are suffering from cancer and they have to visit the Anuradhapura General Hospital once a week for treatment. They do not receive enough food and live on whatever they find on the go.
Five years ago, the mother, Tamara Kumara Jayasinha (46), met with an accident and received fatal injuries. A kidney injury that she received in the accident has turned now into a cancer.
She said she has to visit the hospital once in three days and one visit costs her about Rs. 1,000. Her husband, R.M.D. Edirisinha (49), too, is suffering from a lung cancer. He also has to visit Anuradhapura for weekly clinics.
Their jobless eldest married son (24) is living with them along with his wife and four children. They have had to sell all their assets including their land for finding the cost for treatment. She and her husband are so weak now that a smallest work is an unbearable burden for them.
They receive Rs. 5,000 monthly from the North Western Provincial Council to get medicine for her kidney disease. Two children are still schooling but they will not attend school this year since they cannot find money to spend on them. They do not have even toilet facilities.
They plead for donations from philanthropists and the public to ease their burden. Any association, philanthropist, or person can help them by donating money or any other things they need. Contributions can be made to the Lanka Bank Account No. 79287470, Nochchiyagama. Contact No: 0773287568.

Heavy scoring by schoolboys continues as season hots up
It is good to note that many schoolboy cricketers from the lesser known schools are scoring heavily in the inter-schools cricket tournament being played throughout the country. Perhaps they are looking to be recognized by the public who vote for the popular schoolboy cricketer contest conducted by Mobitel-Observer of ANCL.
Kalana Madhusanka of Seethawaka National School has come into the limelight scoring his third double ton this season. The captain of the team and right handed batsman scored 201 runs off just 156 deliveries inclusive of eight sixes and 26 fours in their encounter against Gankanda Central.
Another notable achievement by Madhusanka is that he has already scored 900 runs from just eight innings with three double centuries and two centuries.

India axe openers, Australia recall Marsh for 3rd Test
Melbourne, Tuesday: India axed both openers Tuesday while Australia recalled allrounder Mitchell Marsh at the expense of struggling batsman Peter Handscomb for the high-stakes third Test.
With the four-Test series tied 1-1, much is riding on the Boxing Day showdown at the Melbourne Cricket Ground where up to 90,000 fans are expected, and India cant afford another top order flop.
Murali Vijay and KL Rahul scored just 95 runs between them in eight innings across the opening two Tests in Adelaide and Perth, failing to play their part alongside the likes of Virat Kohli and Cheteshwar Pujara.
They have paid the price with debutant Mayank Agarwal expected to open the batting with Hanuma Vihari, who is set to be bumped up the order.
Experienced No.6 Rohit Sharma was declared fit and resumes his place in the side after missing the Perth Test.
But ace spinner Ravichandran Ashwin, who also missed that game, has failed to recover from an abdominal strain, with left-arm finger-spinner Ravindra Jadeja brought in as part of a four-man attack.
Skipper Kohli, who had some testy exchanges in Perth with Australian counterpart Tim Paine, insisted the defeat there was in the past and his team was starting with a new slate in Melbourne.
As a team, whether youre 2-0 up or 1-0 down, what has happened in the past has no significance to what is going to happen in the next Test, he said before the team was announced.
So the key is to stay in the moment, stay in the present. We just need to play consistently good cricket and not get too excited or taken aback from situations in the match.
Kohli, who scored a battling century in Perth but was criticised for failing to acknowledge the crowd when he was controversially given out, also said he would not be looking for confrontations with Paine in Melbourne.
Both teams are passionate and desperate to win. Obviously, things happen on the field. But as long as the line isnt crossed, he said.
Im sure Tim and myself understand what happened and we dont want to do something unnecessary. We want to lead our teams well and play good cricket that the public wants to see.
Despite winning to level the series in Perth, Australia opted for change by recalling Marsh, whose part-time seamers will help relieve pressure on the home sides pace attack on a pitch that is not expected to offer as much for the bowlers as Adelaide or Perth.
Part of the thinking also revolves around the potentially decisive fourth and final Test in Sydney, with only a three-day recovery period if Melbourne goes the full five-day distance.
Handscomb is the fall guy, axed after scoring just 34, 14, 7 and 13 across four innings.
Im sure Pete would be upset. I think hes had conversations with the selectors that theres a few things they would like him to work on and Pete is open to that, Paine said.
He added that he did not believe dropping a player from a winning XI would impact Australias momentum.
No I dont think so, we did it last year during the Ashes as well. The majority of this decision has been based around its a long series, weve played on a lot of hot days and our bowlers have had a big workload, he said.
We believe Mitch can come in and do a really good job with the bat and obviously hell give great support to our bowlers.
Australia - Marcus Harris, Aaron Finch, Usman Khawaja, Shaun Marsh, Travis Head, Mitch Marsh, Tim Paine (capt), Josh Hazlewood, Pat Cummins, Nathan Lyon, Mitchell Starc.
India - Mayank Agarwal, Hanuma Vihari, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli (capt), Ajinkya Rahane, Rohit Sharma, Rishabh Pant, Ravindra Jadeja, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma, Jasprit Bumrah. AFP

## Title: Lessons from Indonesia

Lessons from Indonesia
The very unpredictable nature of tsunamis was driven home when Indonesia was left reeling after yet another tsunami on Saturday. The sudden tsunami hit the country's Sunda Strait on a busy holiday weekend. More than 370 people were killed, at least 1,400 injured and thousands more displaced when waves crashed ashore.
Scientists confirmed that the tsunami was triggered by an underwater landslide following the partial collapse of the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano. Anak Krakatau had been spewing ash and lava for months before a 64-hectare section of its southwest side slipped into the ocean. This caused an underwater landslide and eventually caused the tsunami. Waves hit shorelines 24 minutes after the shock, which was equal to a 3.4-magnitude earthquake. There was no warning to residents.
The latest incident however pales into insignificance when one recalls the massive Indian Ocean Tsunami which occurred exactly 14 years ago, killing 230,000 people including nearly 40,000 Sri Lankans. This tragedy is still raw in our minds, scarred forever by the massive loss of lives on that fateful day. But what the latest tsunami tells us is very clear: Dont let your guard down. Fourteen years on, we have built back better and resettled the affected families. But there is no escaping the reality that tsunamis are now a fact of life for Sri Lankans. For a nation that did not even know the word tsunami existed before 2004, we are now aware of the dangers posed by these massive tidal waves. One of the main reasons for the massive loss of life in the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami was the lack of an early warning system. Although the US geological Survey tried to warn the Indian Ocean countries, a combination of missteps and other factors prevented the message from going to the right eyes and ears. The result was a tragedy of huge proportions. Today, the situation is much different and better. The Indian Ocean region has a sophisticated tsunami information gathering and distribution network that cost billions of dollars called the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System (IOTWS).
All local cellular operators have tested their capability to mass broadcast SMS messages on tsunamis to their subscribers. Warning siren towers have been erected in all coastal areas, with the paths to safety clearly marked. Television and radio stations are under instructions to broadcast any warning messages, for those who may not have access to phones. However, alarming gaps have been reported in the primary and secondary warning mechanisms, most noticeably in Indonesia. It is time for our authorities to assess the viability and readiness of our own tsunami warning systems in conjunction with those of other Indian Ocean countries. With the apparent failure of these systems on recent occasions in Indonesia, all Indian Ocean countries including Sri Lanka must take immediate collective measures to repair and upgrade the warning systems. Any instances of neglect and vandalism must also be looked into.
The tsunami warning mechanism is now ingrained in our minds and the moment Lankan coastal dwellers hear about an undersea earthquake in Asia, they are mentally prepared to reach higher ground. Still, education and awareness is much needed. For example, in tsunami-prone Chile, children are taught in school that if the shaking is strong enough to throw you to the ground, they should run for high ground the minute they can get up. Indeed, technology alone cannot save lives - the warning system has to work with existing infrastructure limitations and the preparedness of local authorities.
Worldwide, scientists are beginning to unravel more details and secrets about tsunamis. Sophisticated computer modeling programmes can pinpoint how a particular tsunami would unfold. Although earthquakes and tsunamis cannot be predicted with any degree of accuracy with the currently available technology, scientists now have a better understanding of how a tsunami wave would behave depending on its origin intended destination and type.
Scientists have also found that a massive tear in the Earths crust could cause massive tsunamis and mega-quakes. The rip in the sea floor runs through the Ring of Fire  a treacherous spot in the Pacific Ocean known for deadly quakes and volcanic activity. The discovery of just how big the new fault  60,000 square kilometres in size and off the north coast of Australia  has confirmed fears that a huge tremor could be imminent. On the other hand, scientists now believe that an asteroid that hits the ocean may not result in the kind of destruction portrayed in Hollywood blockbusters such as Deep Impact and Armageddon.
While Japan, from where the very word tsunami (Big Wave in Japanese) comes, leads the world in tsunami research, many other countries are actively engaged in the field. Sri Lankan universities and research labs must take a more pro-active interest in tsunami research, given Sri Lankas increased vulnerability to earthquakes and tsunamis. Several tremors have been felt in Sri Lanka post-2004. This experience and the lesson from Indonesia is that a tsunami can strike anytime  even without any warning. Thus we must be prepared for bigger earthquakes and tsunamis. Eternal vigilance is the only answer.

Leverage of Finance
Last four articles in this series covered key macroeconomic indicators relating to national production, labour market, fiscal sector and foreign sector and what they reflect on economic development of the country since 1950s. This article outlines key indicators representative of the financial sector.
With the invention of money that has been evolving in various modes, a new market of money started developing in economies. Money became a commonly accepted intermediary to finance economic transactions through a unit of account, medium of exchange, deferred payment system and liquid store of wealth. In reality, money has become a factor of production in forms of credit and financial capital to undertake production. In modern economies, no business can survive without money.
Financial Markets
Financial markets operate to facilitate demand for and supply of money to cater to economic activities. Markets differ across financial products such as bank credit, Treasuries, private credit, equities and derivatives. As financial products are the various deferred payment terms, i.e., lending products, they involve in risks of defaults and loss of value (purchasing power) between today and future. Therefore, the price of financial products is the interest rate which is the premium paid by the borrower to the lender to compensate for underlying risks and determined by the demand for and supply of respective financial products. Some products such as equities and bonds are traded on prices based on underlying interest rates/yields in markets.
Interest rates and financial prices are largely determined by estimates and speculation on the profitability of underlying real economic/business activities and are highly volatile due to changing set of information/speculations on underlying business activities and the economy. Interest rates/yield rates on government securities (Treasuries) and stock prices are used as broader economic indicators that reflect the movements of financial markets.
Treasuries yields are the benchmarks of lowest risks (sovereign risk) that are used to price private financial products with varying premia to capture respective risks. In developed market economies, the yield curve which is the plot of yield rates across Treasuries of different maturities traded in the secondary market drives other financial markets while financial investments also move between Treasuries and other products. As stocks are the capital used in real businesses, movements of stock price indices in active markets reflect changes in business sentiments in the economy. In developed countries, stock market prices are market signals for macroeconomic economic policies, present and future. However, Sri Lanka does not have an active stock market to reflect business sentiments.
Regulation of Financial Markets
Financial markets are highly regulated through the monetary policy and prudential and consumer protection regulations.
Monetary policy is the regulation on interest rates, exchange rates, credit and liquidity in the economy. Central banks control them to achieve certain targets of employment, production and prices in the economy by influencing on the demand side of the economy. Many central banks use two major policy instruments, i.e., policy interest rates (corridor) and open market operations (OMO). Policy interest rates, i.e., standing deposit facility rate 8% (earlier repo rate) and standing lending facility rate 9% (earlier reverse repo rate) at present, are the minimum and maximum targets for the over-night inter-bank market interest rates. OMO is the injection or absorption of funds/liquidity by central banks in the inter-bank credit market in order to keep the overnight inter-bank interest rates within the central banks policy interest rates corridor. In addition, central banks implement bank reserve requirements, credit ceilings/restrictions and sector-specific credit to control the volume of credit and money created and distributed in the economy.
The monetary policy is intended to control prices (inflation) and to facilitate economic growth and employment within targets appropriate for the stability of the economy. The monetary policy is tightened during inflationary times and relaxed during times of low economic growth. Therefore, monetary policy is the mechanism to provide seed credit by printing money which is used by others to create several rounds of credit in the financial sector.
Therefore, levels and movements of interest rates, prices of financial products and monetary/financial liquidity in markets are greatly regulated by the monetary policy changes. The policy transmission affects the supply of credit and money and aggregate demand in the economy. Policy interest rates, Treasuries yield rates, bank credit growth and growth of money supply are used as economic indicators reflective of monetary conditions that interact with the economy.
There are several other regulators for various segments of the financial system such as banks, non-bank financial institutions and stock exchanges. They are expected to keep the market stable by avoiding unhealthy volatilities and asset bubbles. The literature on financial and economic stability shows that the excessive leverage or credit expansion is unhealthy and serves as warning of future financial instabilities. In respect of the economy, the leverage is measured as ratios of money and bank credit to national income (GDP).
Economic Story of Numbers
The conventional set of financial sector indicators outlined below shows that the financial sector is largely determined by the regulatory environment and fiscal front as policy solutions to macroeconomic issues in different times. Therefore, these indicators cannot explain macroeconomic trends during long periods such as decades.
Policy Interest Rates
Policy interest rates have moved in cycles of several years reflecting the tight monetary policy (high interest rates) followed by subsequent relaxation (low interest rates) and vice versa (see Chart 1). As credit ceilings, statutory reserves and open market operations also have also been used, interest rates are not reflective of monetary demand arising from the macroeconomy. The monetary policy is driven by certain controversial ideologies on relationships between money, inflation and economic growth through the demand side of the economy.
Therefore, policy mistakes are frequent. For example, the whole world including the President Trump is blaming the US Federal Reserve on aggressive monetary tightening during the last two years that has caused excessive global currency tensions and stock market sell-offs back to 2008 levels. The levels of policy interest rates in countries have diverse stories. Some example are the negative or zero rates maintained in western countries in the past decade, around 20% in Sri Lanka in 2000, around 18% in early 1980, 8% in early 1990, 3% in late 1992, 6% in 2000 and 0-0.25% in 2008-2015 in the US, 24% in present Turkey and around 60% in present Argentina due to different economic and monetary policy circumstances in respective economies.
However, no economist can establish empirical evidence whether such monetary policies have been successful in stabilizing the economies, other than controversial ideologies and significant volatilities created to financial markets and economies. In most cases, policy mistakes are well clear. This is why the President Donald Trump openly criticizes the present monetary policy of the US Fed.
Treasury bill Yield Rates
Treasury bill yield rates (91 days, 182 days and 364 days) at weekly primary auctions are largely responsive to policy interest rates and government funding requirements. However, these yield rates are not real market rates as the Central Bank heavily intervenes in the market through own purchases outside auctions to prevent the rate hikes when the market liquidity is tight, early redemption of own holdings of bills when the market is liquid and other unpublic arrangements of funds. Therefore, the relationship between the policy interest rates and Treasury bills yield rates are quite irregular although trends are similar (see Chart 1).
For example, yield rates rose faster above the tightened policy interest rates in periods of 2008/09, 2012 and January 2016 to-date while Treasury bill holding of the Central Bank also was raised simultaneously to high levels in order to control market speculations and pressures on yield/interest rates. Therefore, there is a lot of unpublic information and actions behind these rates. As there is no transparent secondary market in government securities, despite being the oldest market, no yield curve is available for the private sector to determine credit risk premium on individual credit.
Monetary Growth
As money stock (M2, i.e., currency and bank deposits held by public) is externally controlled through the monetary policy, its behaviour also follows the monetary policy cycles. Higher growth of money stock is expected to promote economic growth and raise inflation due to easy money and vice versa. However, the growth of money, despite being an essential capital input for production, does not show a clear relationship with the economic growth and inflation (cost of living-based inflation), partly due to monetary policy issues (see Chart 2). As foreign exchange inflow is highly volatile, fluctuations in monetary growth have been driven primarily by bank credit. Since credit is highly regulated, the monetary growth is not reflective of the real credit demand in the economy.
Money/Credit Leverage
The leverage of GDP on both bank money (M2) and bank credit has not increased fast and shows constrained monetary liquidity. The ratio of money to GDP has increased to around 42% in 2017 from 20-25% in 1950s (see Chart 3). The ratio of bank credit to GDP has increased to 39% in 2017 from below 10% in early 1950s. When under-estimation of GDP is considered, there is much space for expansion of money and credit to facilitate real businesses and employment in the country.
New Policy Direction Required
The country cannot fast-track its growth without innovating the financial sector to provide wider access of credit and capital to people in order to improve and mobilize productive resources. In this regard, following points are made.
Relaxed Regulations to Broaden the Credit Pyramid
The present financial sector regulatory mechanism is not pro-development to mobilise productive resources. Instead, it controls credit and money for stability purposes which have never been achieved. Development is dependent on businesses that take risks and innovate production activities. To the extent credit delivery is suppressed by regulations by a set of people on their ideologies, the wider economy is suppressed too.
All developed countries have achieved their development through facilitative credit systems. In many countries, majority of income and employment is created by businesses with low credit ratings and no ratings. However, the present formal financial sector is designed to offer credit to investment grade businesses. Therefore, it is necessary to relax regulations to broad-base the financial sector to take wider business risks from corporates to venture capital, micro-enterprises and student loans.
As monetary economies operate through credit, regulatory mechanism needs to facilitate the financial sector or credit pyramid to develop and deliver credit to wider economic activities with varying risks. Banking, shadow banking, credit markets (government and private) and capital markets are the broader layers of credit pyramid. The use of the banking alone to finance the wider economy and take risks of businesses is highly risky, given its systemic importance to the national monetary and payment system.
In good economic democracy, everybody with productive skills and resources should be provided with the access to credit/money to utilize the opportunities for economic/business activities that generate production, employment and income. Therefore, significant relaxation and coordination of regulations are necessary for market development. The principal behind regulatory innovations/relaxations should be that those who do businesses bear risks and returns while the state is not there to bail-out everybody. The state will have systems to alert on crises and control the damages caused by system failures.
Urgent Need for Sectoral Credit-based Monetary Policy
As the monetary policy is the core/spine of the credit pyramid, it has to be innovated to deliver credit directly to productive sectors such as agriculture, construction, exports and SMEs with a national credit plan as followed in 1980s to target the development of the national economy. Present inter-bank dealings and liquidity-based monetary policy that focuses on the control of unknown inflation is the model copied from western countries with developed markets which is not suitable for Sri Lanka.
The national monetary policy mandated by the Monetary Law Act is primarily the sectoral credit distribution for the development of the economy. The Central Bank has no research whether the present monetary policy model fulfills sectoral credit needs of the economy. Everybody knows the grave scarcity of credit throughout the economy.
As the literature shows, ad-hoc state-sponsored credit schemes implemented through state banks cannot expand the access to credit. Such schemes invariably end up in creation of a set of new defaulters and capital and liquidity problems to those banks due to political reasons. Therefore, the credit delivery has been widened within the national monetary policy framework.
State Master Plan for Financial Sector
It is the constitutional right of the people to see that the state ensures that the operation of the economic system does not result in the concentration of wealth and means of production to the common detriment and the state eliminates economic and social privilege and disparity and the exploitation of man by man and by the state. The access to affordable credit based on skills and ability is an essential means to eliminate disparities and exploitations and to improve privileges.
Therefore, it is urgent that the government now prepares a time-bound master plan to broad-base the credit system for economic development and directs respective state authorities to implement the new financial system fairly soon in one to two years. No credit pyramid/financial system can be efficient and productive without transparency in inter-bank interest rates, yield curve and stock prices that are the benchmarks of different layers of risks to be used for private credit transactions and investments. State economic services should be aligned to utilize the credit pyramid and not to block it.
The issue is whether the government is capable of doing this. Present statutes have the adequate flexibility. However, relevant bureaucracy will prevent such innovations by claiming for new laws as usual as they do not like to change their comfort zones. In that environment, no one can expect the development of the country in next few decades.

New Sports Minister, new hope for cricket
A change in the Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) constitution reducing the voting strength of its membership has been a long standing requirement if the game is to be freed from politics, corruption, financial mismanagement etc that has affected this noble game over the years.
The appointment of former Josephian sportsman Harin Fernando as the new Minister of Sports in addition to his duties as Minister of Telecommunications, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment has renewed hopes that this could become a reality.
Without wasting much time the Minister has got down to brass tacks and made it known that he is all for a change in the SLC constitution, but the only issue with it is that he needs to buy time to make the effective changes which has to be done in parliament as obtaining a two-thirds majority from the membership of the SLC is out of the question. The majority of the membership would not want a change because of the present autonomy they enjoy as controlling members (2 votes) and affiliated members (1 vote).
When the SLC constitution was first drawn up it was done with good intentions and those who held office prior to the countrys 1996 World Cup victory did so with passion for the game and with a will to contribute to towards the betterment of it.
To be more descriptive the Ceylon Cricket Association (CCA) was formed in 1922 with Dr John Rockwood as the first president and Col OB Forbes as the first honorary secretary. The formation of the CCA came into being as the Marylebone Cricket Club (MCC) which governed international cricket at the time wanted a cricket association, a controlling body for cricket in Ceylon (as it was then known) in place before it would send out an official team.
A new controlling body for cricket was formed in 1948 and the CCA was renamed the Board of Control for Cricket in Sri Lanka (BCCSL) with P Saravanamuttu as the president and MKM Ismail as the honorary secretary. It was renamed Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) in 2003. The SLC is thus the apex national body for the administration and development of cricket in Sri Lanka, including management of the Sri Lanka cricket team.
Winning the World Cup not only brought immense joy to the passionate cricket followers but also uplifted the game in all corners of the country. At the same time with their new found recognition as one of the cricketing powers of the world the SLCs finances started to swell of undreamt proportions and this attracted many businessmen to run for the presidency and hold office much to the detriment of the game.
What happened afterwards was that in a bid to hold onto power member clubs were brought over by those in power and promoted to play in the countrys Premier inter-club cricket tournaments thus diluting the quality of cricket played which has had a direct bearing on the quality of cricketers coming through the system that has gravely affected the national teams performances. Corruption has been rife and there has been question marks raised over the distribution of finances and the eligibility of certain officials to run for the top office-bearer posts.
A court case is currently pending over the latter that has resulted in the SLC elections being postponed and a competent authority appointed by the former Sports Minister running the day to day affairs of SLC.
Now with a new Sports Minister in place determined to clean up the Augean stables there is renewed hope that he will be given the time and support to do so.
The government came quite close to changing the SLC constitution based on the proposals put forward by former Sri Lanka cricketer and former interim committee chairman Sidath Wettimuny and presenting it in Parliament during the time when Navin Dissanayake was the Sports Minister but unfortunately the portfolios changed at a very crucial time and Dayasiri Jayasekera became the Sports Minister. Being a close associate of the then SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala the much looked-forward to changes to the constitution never took place and simply went under the carpet allowing Sumathipala to administer the game to his whims and fancy.
Cricket today needs honest, committed people who uphold the game in its true traditions to run it. It is not that we lack such individuals but they dont stand a dogs chance to get elected under the present SLC constitution. The only way they can serve the game is through interim committees which are not the right answer to the problem at hand because unlike an elected body they cannot function for long. The ICC too is not keen on countries being administered by interim committees because they are government appointed.
However according to the new Sports Minister the present situation deems an interim committee be appointed to administer SLC until such time the necessary changes are made to its constitution. Lets hope for the sake of the game it becomes a reality.

Relish rather than fear Old Trafford, Solskjaer tells Man Utd
Manchester, Monday: Manchester United return to Old Trafford for the first time under Ole Gunnar Solskjaers management against Huddersfield on Boxing Day with a new-found swagger after scoring five goals in the Premier League for the first time in five years.
The Norwegians caretaker spell in charge until the end of the season got off to a dream start as United threw off the shackles, that led to turgid football and deteriorating results under Jose Mourinho, to thrash Cardiff 5-1.
United still face a huge challenge to make up an eight-point gap just to qualify for next seasons Champions League via a top-four finish.
But for now the luxury of just being able to enjoy watching a side play with freedom and the attacking principles that have underpinned the clubs history is enough to excite United fans again.
I think the boys are looking forward to playing at Old Trafford and thats important. We should be looking forward to that, they are the best fans in the world, said Solskjaer when questioned whether some of the current United squad have been inhibited by the pressures of playing at home in the famous red shirt.
Solskjaer is certainly a favourite of the United faithful having scored 126 goals in 11 seasons as a player, including the one that famously won the Champions League final in 1999.
He was serenaded throughout by the visiting fans in the Welsh capital at the weekend as United hit five for the first time since Alex Fergusons final game in charge.
I just hope in the next five months I do a good enough job for them to keep singing my name when someone else comes in, added Solskjaer, whose positivity has immediately lifted a squad downtrodden by Mourinhos mood swings.
Just to be positive. Take risks, said Jesse Lingard, who scored twice in Cardiff, at what Solskjaers message has been.
If you lose the ball, win it back, and play the United way - attacking football, entertaining football. For us as players, we enjoyed it today.
Rarely has enjoyment ever been top of Mourinhos list of priorities, even in his most successful spells with Porto, Chelsea and Inter Milan.
Work harder
However, the levels of committment he demanded from those sides was not evident in the current United squad.
For the first time this season, United outran their opponents against Cardiff.
A Man United team should never ever be outworked, said Solskjaer to highlight the minimum he expects.
Doesnt matter which team you play. You should run more than them and then your skills will give you the chance to win the game.
A good work ethic should be the minimum required of a Manchester United team, but Mourinhos tactics also didnt help his sides running statistics.
Too often the Red Devils were set up to sit deep and try and counter-attack. Solskjaer instead seems intent on implementing the United way he learned at the heel of Ferguson for so long.
I said the same to these lads as I do back in Molde: work harder than them, enjoy yourselves, pass it forward, run forward, if you lose it, I dont mind as long as you work to win it back and they did.
When youve got players like this with the quality you are always going to create chances.
The best Christmas present for many United fans may be the gift of being able to look forward to games with a sense of anticipation again. AFP

Saving the world from Tsunamis
Today marks the 14th anniversary of the Boxing Day Tsunami in 2004 in the Indian Ocean which killed nearly 240,000 people in Asia and Africa. It is an ever-present danger, as Indonesia learned just a couple of days ago and yes, they can strike without any warning.
Just what is a tsunami Tsunami is a Japanese word comprising the words tsu (meaning harbour) and nami (meaning wave). It is not surprising that this word has originated in Japan, considering the frequency of tsunamis there.
A tsunami is a series of enormous waves created by an underwater disturbance usually associated with earthquakes occurring below or near the ocean. Volcanic eruptions (like the one in Indonesia caused by son of Krakatoa), submarine landslides, and coastal rock falls can also generate a tsunami, as can a large asteroid impacting the ocean. They originate from a vertical movement of the sea floor with the consequent displacement of water mass. Tsunami waves often look like walls of water and can attack the shoreline and be dangerous for hours, with waves coming every 5 to 60 minutes. The first wave may not be the largest, and often it is the 2nd, 3rd, 4th or even later waves that are the biggest.
Tsunamis are rare events, but can be extremely deadly. In the past 100 years, 58 tsunamis have claimed more than 260,000 lives, or an average of 4,600 per disaster, surpassing any other natural hazard. The highest number of deaths in that period was in the Indian Ocean tsunami of December 26, 2004. Hence the name Boxing Day Tsunami. It caused fatalities in 14 countries, with Indonesia, Sri Lanka, India and Thailand hardest-hit. Just a few months ago, a tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia took over 1,200 lives. Japan most recently experienced a major tsunami in March 2011, which killed nearly 16,000 people, with around 2,500 still missing.
Disaster risk reduction
Just three weeks after the Boxing Day Tsunami, the international community came together in Kobe, in Japans Hyogo region. Governments around the world adopted the 10-year Hyogo Framework for Action, the first comprehensive global agreement on disaster risk reduction.
They also created the Indian Ocean Tsunami warning and Mitigation System which boasts scores of seismographic and sea-level monitoring stations and disseminates alerts to national tsunami information centres. Rapid urbanization and growing tourism in tsunami-prone regions are putting ever-more people in harms way. That makes the reduction of risk a key factor if the world is to achieve substantial reductions in disaster mortality  a primary goal of the Sendai Framework, the 15-year international agreement adopted in March 2015 to succeed the Hyogo Framework.
Today, the very word tsunami sends a shiver down our spines, although most people did not even know the word until December 2004. Thus we are generally aware of what a tsunami can do. This is why whenever we hear of an earthquake in Indonesia or a nearby country, we immediately think of a tsunami and try to take precautions such as reaching higher ground. In fact, there were a couple of tsunami alerts in Sri Lanka after 2004 which sent everyone in coastal areas scampering for safer ground. However, the most recent tsunami in Indonesia came without warning and most Lankans knew about it only when they woke up and listened to the news.
In retrospect, there is enough awareness about tsunamis now. People generally know what to do and how to behave in an impending tsunami situation without even being told. What has not been really tested is our state of readiness, including the functionality of the tsunami alert system. Although several drills have been held from time to time, we do not know how the systems will behave collectively in a real-life tsunami crisis. For example, will a tsunami alert text message be delivered to 21 million phones in a matter of minutes
Glaring deficiencies in this respect were exposed during the recent tsunami in Sulawesi, Indonesia as sections of the alert mechanism were found to be non-functioning. A tsunami warning was sent out by Indonesia's meteorological and geophysics agency BMKG - lasting just over 30 minutes - but it appears to have drastically underestimated the scale of the tsunami that would follow.
There seems to have been a combination of rather unfortunate factors at play here. There are fears that though the alert was sent out, and according to the communications ministry, repeated tsunami warnings were sent to residents via text message - they might not have been received. This is a lesson that Sri Lankan authorities must also look at. Sending a text to 20 million phones may not be as simple as it sounds  a spokesman for BMKG said the quake had brought down the area's power and communications lines and that there were no sirens along the coast, which might have rendered the alerts essentially useless even if received.
Early warning system
Another factor is that critical components of the expensive early warning system may have not been working properly due to natural damage and even vandalism. The third factor, which is common to most developing countries, is the lack of a maintenance budget for systems such as these. Sri Lankan authorities must urgently assess the operational capability and readiness of the early warning system. Any Budgetary constraints must be immediately addressed regardless of the costs involved since the latest disaster has highlighted the costs of not having implemented a more sophisticated early warning system. The Indian Ocean countries and Japan must thus intensify research on earthquakes and tsunamis and collaborate more closely with well-known bodies such as the US Geological Survey (USGS).
We must also be wary of Climate Change which can cause low-lying cities to go underwater. There will be a greater threat of landslide tsunamis as some of melting glacial mountains can topple into the sea, generating massive tsunamis. With a wave run-up of nearly 200 metres, the tsunami that ripped through an Alaskan fjord in 2015 was one of the largest ever documented. But with no-one killed, it almost went unnoticed. It was triggered by a massive rockfall caused by melting of the Tyndall Glacier, which experts say has given them the clearest picture to date of a landslide generated tsunami.
Accurate earthquake prediction remains the Holy Grail of scientists. Forecasting an earthquake's approximate date assumes earthquakes follow some kind of pattern  that faults release pressure in a predictable way. But this does not always happen. Unlike us, animals seem to be having a sixth sense that can give them an indication of an impending disaster, well before any of our advanced gadgets. In fact, no animals perished in the 2004 tsunami except those who were tied or caged. Humans have lost this sense in the course of evolution, so we have to rely on technology instead. There is even talk of using Artificial Intelligence, somewhat akin to the animals sixth sense, to predict earthquakes at least a few minutes in advance. We hope these efforts succeed, because that would mean more lives can be saved.
Tsunamis are unpredictable, but armed with more knowledge and better warning systems, we will be able to minimize any loss of life and property if and when a major tsunami strikes. Are we prepared for another such event It is very difficult to get shattered lives back on track  what do you say to a little girl who had lost her entire family to the raging waves To parents who lost all their children While tsunami affected people can be provided with jobs and housing, there will always be those who cannot come to terms with their loss.
There must be a mechanism to deal with this kind of psychological emergency. The response to a tsunami should be multifaceted and swift. But lets hope that we never have to face a tsunami again.

Steyn bids for record but says there is more to come
Centurion, Monday: Fast bowler Dale Steyn said on Monday he was looking beyond breaking the record for most Test wickets for South Africa in the forthcoming series against Pakistan.
Steyn currently shares the record of 421 wickets with former captain Shaun Pollock, who retired in 2008, and needs one more wicket in the first Test against Pakistan, starting at SuperSport Park on Wednesday, to hold first place on his own.
I have a lot more wickets in me than just one more, he said. I havent saved myself just to take one more wicket than Polly (Pollock), there is a bigger goal at the end of the day.
He admitted that the past two years, during which he has had several setbacks had been frustrating.
I do think it will be a beautiful thing to happen, if it happens. It has taken a long time and these records are great things to achieve.
I will be highly honoured but I will get back to my mark and try to take the next one.
The 35-year-old, who will be playing in his 89th Test, seemed set to take the record when he played in two Tests in Sri Lanka earlier this year but could only take two wickets to tie with Pollock.
Its just nice to have a red ball in my hand again, he said.
Sri Lanka was tough conditions for the fast bowlers, but by the looks of things - the way the nets have been playing out in the middle - there is some spice.
I am looking forward to getting out there and playing five competitive days of cricket.
Steyn is currently joint eleventh in the all-time list of wicket-takers in Test cricket. Sri Lankan spinner Muttiah Muralitharan, who retired in 2010, heads the list with 800 while the top fast bowler is current England opening bowler James Anderson with 565. AFP

US Government charges ex-envoy Jaliya
The United States Government has charged Jaliya Chitran Wickramasuriya with two counts of wire fraud, two counts of money laundering and one count of immigration fraud.
This is in connection with the embezzlement of US$ 320,000 funds of the Sri Lankan government intended for the purchase of a new embassy building there.
Wickramasuriya was appointed as Sri Lankas Ambassador to the United States and Mexico in August 2008 by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is his first cousin.
From around late 2012 to November 2014, the defendant Jaliya Wickramasuriya devised and intended to devise a scheme to defraud the government of Sri Lanka during the purchase of the embassy, and to obtain money by means of materially false and fraudulent pretenses, representations and promises, according to the indictment unsealed last week by the US District Court for the District of Columbia.
The embezzlement of state funds was reported by the US government to Sri Lankan authorities in 2014, which led to a request by the US that Wickramasuriya be recalled from diplomatic service in that country. While President Rajapaksa did recall Wickramasuriya, no criminal charges were filed against him by Sri Lankan authorities, nor did the Rajapaksa regime waive the diplomatic immunity that complicated efforts to charge the former ambassador in the United States.
The thirteen-page indictment filed by US prosecutors subsequent to an investigation conducted by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) unit sets out the alleged criminal scheme in detail.
Between 2008 and 2014, defendant Jaliya Chitran Wickramasuriya served as Ambassador from the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka to the United States. While serving as Ambassador, the defendant also owned an operated company in Sri Lanka named Ceylon Royal Tea and Supplies, and a company in the state of Georgia named Ceylon Royal Tea and Supplies, collectively Ceylon Royal Tea.
In 2012, the defendant was involved in selecting 3024 Whitehaven St NW, Washington D.C. as the location for the new embassy. In 2013, the defendant caused official funds from Sri Lanka to be wired to a HSBC bank account in Washington D.C., which were used to purchase the new embassy.
On or about January 12, 2013, the defendant prepared a memorandum in which he instructed the Title Company and Closing Attorney to disburse the unaccounted for $332,027.35 in funds to two third parties, both of which had no role in the real estate transaction. The defendant signed this memorandum.
According to Wickramasuriyas instructions, US$ 82,000 was to be disbursed by wire or cheque to a US based consultant company, which is not named in the indictment, but is identified in FCID B Reports as Paper Crown LLC, owned by a close Wickramasuriya associate, Vinod Basnayake. $250,000 was to be disbursed to a Sri Lankan company, described as Sri Lankan Company C in the indictment, which was in fact PPP International Pvt Ltd, owned by a Brendan Sosa. On or about January 15, 2013, the defendant, using a non-embassy e-mail account, emailed this memorandum, containing the disbursement instructions for the excess funds, to the Closing Attorney.
The disbursements to these two private companies were not authorised by the government of Sri Lanka, according to the indictment. On or about January 17, 2013, the Title Company successfully wired $82,027.35 from the Title Company Bank Account to Paper Crown LLC, which was nominated by Wickramasuriya. On the same day, the Title Company attempted to wire $250,000 to PPP International in Sri Lanka. However, the wire was unsuccessful because an intermediary bank rejected it.
Wickramasuriya was notified of the failed wire transfer. Thereafter, on or about January 20, 2013, the defendant, using his personal email account, sent an email to Closing Attorney that instructed Closing Attorney to mail a cheque to Sri Lanka for $250,000 payable to PPP International.
A cheque was instead made out for $250,000 payable to Wickramasuriya directly, and mailed to the address of Ceylon Royal Tea, Wickramasuriyas company in Sri Lanka. Initially, the defendants efforts to have the cheque cashed in Sri Lanka were not successful, the indictment reads. On or about March 19, 2013, a co-conspirator of Wickramasuriya directed the closing attorney to prepare documentation indicating that PPP International was involved in the real estate transaction so that the funds could be released to their bank account in Sri Lanka. However, this company was not involved in the real estate transaction according to the indictment.
Then, on or about March 19, 2013, Wickramasuriya using his personal email account, told Closing Attorney not to send any emails regarding PPP International to his official Sri Lankan government email account. The next day, according to the indictment, the funds were successfully received in Sri Lanka.
According to a report filed with the Colombo Fort Magistrates Court by the FCID in a connected investigation, at least Rs 18 million of the money embezzled from the embassy and laundered through PPP International was later deposited in the Sri Lankan bank account of Ceylon Royal Tea, the company owned by Wickramasuriya.
The indictment further charges that when Sri Lankan embassy officials began investigating the suspicious transfers,Wickramasuriya took steps to cover up his misdeeds. He gave embassy officials a document labeled Addendum to the Settlement Statement, the indictment says. The Addendum was undated, not written on official letterhead, and unsigned by the buyer or seller of the embassy property. The Addendum detailed payments made as Commission to Agents totaling $332,027.35. The Addendum stated that this purported commission was split evenly into two payments
of $166,013.68 each to the respective real estate companys of the buyer and seller. In fact, no such commission payments totaling $332,027.35 were made to either company, according to the indictment. The indictment further details how the former ambassador replaced the embezzled funds after his scheme had been unearthed by embassy officials.
In or around October 2013, the defendant approached the Embassy Realtor with a request for the Embassy Realtor to receive a money transfer of approximately $332,000. Based on prior communication with the defendant, the Embassy Realtor hoped that this transfer was payment for a proposed renovation to the embassy, which needed to be changed from a residence to office space.
After the conversation with Wickramasuriya, the indictment says, the realtor received five payments totaling $332,000. Of this sum $40,000 came from a Sri Lankan company with a note stating Loan to Jaliya Wickramasuriya, $125,000 came from an acquaintance of Wickramasuriya, $32,000 from the former ambassador himself and sums of $73,265 and $61,735 respectively from two US-based companies employed by Wickramasuriya as consultants to the
embassy. A cashiers cheque was drawn out for this total sum of $ 332,027.35 issued to the Embassy of Sri Lanka, the indictment reveals.
The defendant personally collected the cashiers cheque from the Embassy Realtor. The defendant subsequently deposited the cashiers cheque into the Sri Lankan government bank account. The defendant subsequently provided the Sri Lankan authorities with a letter from the Embassy Realtor and addressed to the defendant, which stated that a cashiers cheque in the amount of $332,027.35 was being issued to the Sri Lankan embassy as a final reimbursement. This letter was purportedly signed by the Embassy Realtor. In fact, however, the Embassy Realtor did not write or sign this letter, the indictment exposes.
The charges in the United States are restricted to wire fraud, money laundering and immigration fraud.Wickramasuriya also faces prosecution in Sri Lankan jurisdiction in connection with the same events, for charges of criminal breach of trust and forgery, among other offenses.

Warriors face LeBrons Lakers in Christmas NBA feast
New York, Monday: LeBron James, coming off an apology for a controversial song lyric post on Instagram, makes his 13th Christmas appearance Tuesday when his Los Angeles Lakers visit reigning NBA champion Golden State.
The Warriors-Lakers contest is part of the leagues five-game holiday slate, which also includes Milwaukee at New York, Philadelphia at Boston, Oklahoma City at Houston and Portland at Utah.
James will match the second-most Christmas appearances in NBA history with retired stars Shaquille ONeal, Earl Monroe and Dolph Schayes plus former Miami and Cleveland teammate Dwyane Wade, although ex-Lakers guard Kobe Bryant owns the record of 16 games played on December 25.
After the Lakers 107-99 loss Sunday to Memphis, James apologized to ESPN for posting lyrics from the hip-hop song ASMR by 21 Savage that included: We been getting that Jewish money, Everything is Kosher.
Apologies, for sure, if I offended anyone, James said. Thats not why I chose to share that lyric... I actually thought it was a compliment, and obviously it wasnt through the lens of a lot of people. My apologies. It definitely was not the intent, obviously, to hurt anybody.
James, a four-time NBA Most Valuable Player, led Cleveland into the NBA Finals the past four seasons against Golden State, losing three times but bringing the city a long-awaited first NBA crown in 2016.
James, who departed for the Lakers in July, has reached the past eight NBA Finals and nine overall with a 3-6 record, taking two titles with Miami as well as his crown with the Cavaliers, who now share the NBAs worst record with Phoenix at 8-26.
The Warriors, powered by stars Kevin Durant and Stephen Curry, trail the Denver Nuggets by a percentage point in the fight for the Western Conference lead at 23-11 while the Lakers, who havent made the playoffs since 2013, are fourth at 19-14.
The NBA Christmas lineup, televised to 215 nations, features 38 players from outside the United States, Utah having the most with six.
Australia has the most international players on offer with six, including 2018 NBA Rookie of the Year Ben Simmons with the Philadelphia 76ers as they face the Celtics in the best Eastern Conference matchup on offer.
Its the start of a five-game road trip for the 76ers, who share third in the East with Indiana at 22-12 ahead of fifth-place Boston (19-13) as they try to integrate Jimmy Butler into the lineup following a trade last month with Minnesota.
Were coming into a really great part of our year. Its starting to get into a real interesting part in that youre playing against really good teams, 76ers coach Brett Brown said.
I want to see how the bench and our young players are developing, 76ers general manager Elton Brand said. Can we play with some of these teams that are elite, these West coast teams, on the road Its a huge stretch for us right now. AFP

Yan Oya farmers await compensation
Hundreds of farmers undergo severe difficulties since the State acquired their lands for the Yan Oya reservoir project. Its construction work commenced four years ago and now it receives water.
The reservoir contains 149,000 acre feet of water protected with a 3.5 k.m. long main dam at Pamburugaswewa near Wahalkada.
However, authorities failed to demarcate muddy land for those who lost their paddy fields for the construction work to date.
Over 2,731 claims have been submitted for compensation and so far only 171 persons were compensated, Horowpothana Divisional Secretary said.
Sources revealed that it costs Rs. 5,000 million approximately to pay the compensation. Newly settled families complain that they lack drinking water, sanitation, electricity, transportation, education health and other amenities.
People in the reservoir site zone complain that they are not paid for far for the loss they incurred since they could not cultivate in the Yala and Maha seasons. They said they have to be paid Rs. 35,000 per acre for 2018 Yala and 2018/2019 Maha seasons.
Many lands of the farmers were submerged when the water was released to the reservoir although those lands were not in the initial plan. Now they do not get any compensation.
The paddy fields of the farmers in Aliyakadamawathawewa have been submerged, too. Anuradhapura Government Agent A.M. Wanninayake visited the area and instructed the project authorities to provide relief to the victims.
The affected told the GA that they were given muddy lands in Omarakada, around 80 km away from where they live now. Wanninayake told them they will be provided with different lands.
