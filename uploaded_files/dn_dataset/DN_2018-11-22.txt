Ambassadors should not interfere in internal affairs
Ambassadors should not interfere in the country's internal affairs, Sri Sudarshanarama Chief Incumbent Ven.Vijitha Thera said. He said that it had caused several issues in the new Cabinet.
The ven. thera was addressing a crowd during a special conference held at the National Library and Documentation Services Board, yesterday evening.
The Leader of the House should protect Parliamentary traditions, he said, adding that the political crisis could only be quelled by a general election.
The ven. thera said that religious leaders such as Ven. Dambara Amila Thera had attempted influence non-governmental organisations (NGOs) in order to aggravate the issue.
He added that certain parties such as the Tamil National Alliance and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna had chosen a different path to fulfil their personal needs, instead of the needs of the public.
The chief incumbent said that former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe should stand down without abusing his powers any longer.

Govt working to prevent SL being sold out to foreigners
We are now struggling to save Sri Lanka and its citizens from being sold out to foreigners and to safeguard the democratic rights of the common people of this country, said State Finance Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa.
He was speaking at a public meeting in Pannala for voters of the Katugampola electorate of the Kurunegala district on Tuesday.
There has been a severe betrayal of our country by the UNP in the recent past. The UNP was selling national assets to foreign countries and hence, President Maithripala Sirisena was compelled, even reluctantly, to look for a patriotic PM for Sri Lanka, he said.
That is why President Sirisena ultimately chose former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the new PM, because he was a patriotic leader of Sri Lanka who saved this country from the brutal LTTE a few years ago, ending 30 years of terrorism, the State Minister said.
Anti-democratic elements of this country have joined hands with Western anti-Sri Lankan elements to ruin this noble country. Patriotic Sri Lankans should not allow that type of conspiracy in the country, he said.
Lets work in unity to defeat the anti-Sri Lankan forces and anti-democratic elements that haunt Sri Lanka by holding a General Election soon to test the will of the common people of this country, the State Minister said. We should do everything possible to solve the existing political issues in a friendly, democratic and peaceful manner, and that is what both President Sirisena and new Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa aspire to at this critical hour.
All political leaders and Parliamentarians have a duty to the country and its people to ensure the democratic rights of the citizens of this country.
All religious dignitaries belonging to all faiths in this country have requested political leaders to work and act in peace at this moment, for the welfare of this country, he said.

Mother of all shows countdown begins
With the schools cricket season about to unfold the 41st Mobitel Sunday Observer Schools cricketer contest was launched with the generous support of Mobitel. Chairman of Lake House Wasanthapriya Ramanayake and head of operations of Mobitel Telecom Nalin de Silva were present.
This year however, the event reaches a new phase and will be looking out for the best boy and girl cricketers of the year to encourage and foster more girls schools to take to the game.
Sri Lankas women cricketers are having fluctuating fortunes at present and need more players of high quality to take over and perform better at national level.
Sri Lanka also needs high quality schoolboy cricketers as did in the past. They could match any team in the world in that age category during the early years, but of late this has not happened. Therefore there is a great need to encourage the schoolboy cricketers to raise their standard.
No doubt, already there are a few quality players in the likes of Kalana Perera and Kamindu Mendis of S. Thomas fame. Kalana Perera has excelled with both ball and bat while Kamindu has displayed his talent for his ability to bowl with both his arms. This type of bowling can fox out any batsman in the world at that level.
The full cricket season will bloom into full gear after the GCE (Ordinary level) examination in December and the search will begin.
Nevertheless, the usual coupon where readers can vote for the Most Popular players will be run in the Daily News, Sunday Observer, Thinakaran, Dinamina and Tharuni newspapers.
Schoolgirls received some awards last year, but this season there will be more awards on offer. Those will be for the best batswoman, best bowler, best all rounder, best fielder, best schoolgirl cricketer of the year 2019, best schoolgirl cricketer runner-up 2019, best international schoolgirl cricketer 2019, best school girl team and runner-up team the best schoolgirl up and coming team of the year.
The purpose of having this contest is to encourage the players perform better and reach national level in the game. Many schoolboy cricketers who won this contest have gone on to play for the national team. Some of them are Ranjan Madugalle, Roshan Mahanama, Aravinda de Silva, Kumara Dharmasena, just to name a few. This should be the case with the girls too who will be encouraged to perform better and gain recognition. Should they do well a few could be picked and included into the national pool for further training.
We still hear of Sashikala Siriwardane performing well with bat and ball. She was the former captain of the Sri Lanka womens team and still good enough to remain among the top rung players. We should hear of some new names coming up with the introduction of this contest for school girl cricketers.
Madugalle speaks:
Chief guest at the 40th Observer/Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards night Ranjan Madugalle promised that he is prepared to attend the 50th awards night of this prestigious function even travelling on a turbo-charged wheel chair.
Madugalle who was the first recipient of this contest in 1979 when he won the Schoolboy Cricketer award as the captain of Royal College recalled nostalgic moments during his speech that was well received by the packed audience at the Colombo Hilton Hotel in July this year.
I consider it an absolute privilege and I am deeply humbled to be in your midst. As I stand before you tonight an obvious sense of nostalgia overcomes me. It was some 40 years ago that I was on your side. I was much younger, I didnt have grey hair, I didnt wear spectacles and more importantly I was single, said Madugalle.
Forty years later I am on this side speaking to you as someone whos played the game, someone whos walked the life as a cricketer officially, locally and internationally but more importantly as a father of cricket, really because I have children but they are girls.
In another ten years time you will celebrate your 50th Observer School Cricketer of the Year award and I promise you if I have any life left in me Ill come to cheer you all even in a turbo-charged wheelchair, Madugalle said.
Speaking further the former Sri Lanka captain and current ICC chief Match Referee said: Cricket has given me many joys, cricket has given me a life more than anything. Cricket has taught me to live as a useful citizen of my country.
Compliment to ANCL and Mobitel:
Madugalle wound up his speech by complimenting the organisers ANCL and the sponsors Mobitel.
No event can be completed or done successfully without the organizational capacity and sponsorship. I like to thank ANCL for year on year for having staged this function which is getting better and better. It is marked in the school calendar as crickets spot of the year.
Thanks also to Mobitel for providing the sponsorship and without generous resources this kind of event cannot take place.
On behalf of the cricketing fraternity may I thank the organizers and the sponsors for the wonderful work they have done over the years. Mobitel as well as Observer ANCL have done great work once again for being innovators trying to make this awards ceremony bigger, better and more relevant than ever before. Well done.

Poultry farmers in Kurunegala and Puttalam said that they had to sell their products at low rates due to the increased imports of chicken and eggs.
They urged the government to discontinue the importation of chicken and eggs in order to save local poultry farmers from poverty.
The North Western Province (NWP) has about 25,000 small-scale poultry farmers, Kurunegala District Poultry Farmers Association Chairman S.M. Premaratne told the Daily News yesterday.
Farmers were running at a loss of Rs.50 per product, he said, urging the government to take immediate action to resolve the issue.

19th Amendment caused present political impasse
JRJs grandson, Pradip Jayewardene says the Executive Presidency was not to be held to whims and fancies of the Legislature
The Executive Presidency was not to be held to the whims and fancies of the Legislature. By trying to do that through the 19th Amendment, we have created a political crisis. We cant change this system through amendments, said former President J.R. Jayewardenes grandson and current UPFA Member of the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), Pradip Jayewardene, in an interview with the Daily News.
He said the UNP, having moved away from the original principles of the Executive Presidency and ideologies of the former President, has now created a bleak future for itself.
Excerpts follow:
Q: The current political crisis, in a way, has been a result of attempts made to amend the Constitution your grandfather brought. Did that make the situation worse
A: We have already gone into a Presidential System. You cant bring in amendments and change it; you cant make a system change. You have to rewrite the whole Constitution which they didnt do, they just went half way.
We first hear about the 1978 Constitution in 1966 when, at the Ceylon Association for the Advancement of Science, J R Jayewardene (JRJ), as Minister of State, made a speech and detailed the thinking and rationale for an Executive Presidency. Two things influenced him at the time: one was that he felt that because of Parliamentary democracy and change of power balances, legislators were spending a lot of time just focusing on keeping their Parliamentary majority intact. The other factor was that he himself was the architect of breaking the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government by moving Members of Parliament in 1965. He said if this is all it takes to break a government, to move MPs from one side to the other, what is the use of a system like that
In addition, he said economic independence had not been achieved even though we had gained independence. So he proposed a strong Executive for a fixed number of years, free from the whims and fancies of Parliament. In 1972, after the 1971 insurrection, he proposed this system at the Constitutional Council in detail. At that time, some in the UNP, the Dudley Senanayake group opposed it, though Premadasa supported it. But Sirimavo opposed it and it was not adopted.
If it had been passed, Sirimavo would have been the first Executive President. This is the first myth that needs to be broken that the Executive Presidential system was created for JRJ himself. He felt the need for the Executive Presidency much earlier.
Fast forward to 1978, he asked for a mandate for this and received it
We have had this for 40 years now and have been able to achieve economic growth.
There is a lot of propaganda saying that this is not a democratic system, but in my experience this is a system that has preserved democracy. When you take Parliamentary democracy, JRJ in 1972 said that out of 100 democracies, 98 have failed. He said most have become military regimes and once military rule sets in, it is extremely difficult to get back to democracy.
Since we went into the Presidential system, we have not had a threat of military rule, but when we had the Parliamentary system, we did have a coup attempt by the military in 1966. So in my view, the Executive Presidency has preserved democracy, not diminished it.
You hear some say that we need a dictatorship to solve the problems of this country. These are so-called intelligent people saying this because they feel that the government is not acting fast enough or tough enough, but you dont want it acting tougher than the Executive Presidency. To go beyond that is dictatorship where you will get fast action for a short time, but it is a downward slope.
Q: Does the UNP too now propose that the Executive Presidency be done away with
A. The UNP is no longer under the control of traditional UNPers or the traditional values of the UNP. From the time Ranil Wickremesinghe took over the party, he has brought in his own view of neo-liberal policies.
Due to that many, hundreds of good UNPers have left. If you look at the SLFP, many are former UNPers and those who cant digest Left politics have stayed out. This group [Ranil Wickremesinghes] has taken control of the UNP and changed the constitution and removed all democracy from the party. The UNP has a very strong constitution and my grandfather described it as a dictatorship within a democracy. But there was still democracy as once a year, the leadership comes to vote at the annual sessions, but Wickremesinghe took it out, so he became the UNP leader for life. That is very dangerous and then you cant profess democracy when your party is run under a dictatorship.
Q: Even former President JRJ did that in 1978 when he opened up the economy
A. Yes, he did and famously said, Let the robber barons come. No one is saying we dont want foreign capital to come in, but there are limits to how much you open up and there needs to be some regulation. JRJ never opened access to our land, utilities and key resources.
He was also a proponent of land ceilings. In 1972, when he wanted to join Sirimavos government, he agreed to land ceilings. President Premadasa was also the same, he was strong nationalist. Although Premadasa privatised estates, he did not let foreign companies take them over on 99 year leases. That was done by Chandrika Bandaranaike.
Q: Why do you think there is such opposition to the Executive Presidency, if it has worked
A. It has to be said that those who oppose it are doing so without understanding its positives and negatives. They are just calling for its abolition. Governments, while enjoying the powers of the Presidency, kept saying it is not a good system.
There were several things we did to damage the original system. Firstly, the proportional representation system in its original form did not have you campaign throughout the district. You had an electorate, you campaigned in it, and the party made a list for that district. In that list, if you were senior or had a large electorate, you would be higher up. And if you won your electorate, you were able to go to Parliament.
In 1988-89, Lalith Athulathmudali brought in an amendment to remove this electorate basis and asked people to campaign in the whole district. It was advantageous for him because he was well known. But everyone now had to do so too and then it increased the cost exponentially for candidates and they had to find the money from somewhere and black money started to come into politics.
In the first round, those who generated black money started financing the politicians. In the second round, the people who were generating the black money said why should we be paying politicians, we can get into Parliament ourselves and that is where we are today.
Secondly, the minimum qualification for political parties to enter Parliament was 12.5 percent and President Premadasa changed it to 5 percent to allow Muslim parties to come in. That has created at present 68 small parties which are all vying for a piece of kingmakership. They come in, but dont do much for the country.
Thirdly, it was to remove the barrier for MPs to cross over from one party to another. That was done during President Chandrika Bandaranaikes time. In India, you need the support of 25 percent of the membership for an MP to cross over.
Fourthly, President Mahinda Rajapaksa moved away from the original thinking of having the Executive Presidency for a fixed term by introducing the 18th Amendment.
JRJ had proposed that the Executive Presidency would be there for a fixed number of years, to do what is needed for the development of the country, to be able to take correct and unpopular decisions free from the whims and fancies of the Legislature.
So when Mahinda Rajapaksa removed the term limit, the opposition united to overturn the government. They brought in the 19th Amendment and brought the term limit back, but by doing that, they took away the second part of JRJs original intention, which was to keep the Executive free from the whims and fancies of the Legislature. When you bring the Executive back into the Legislature, you have the situation we have now.
I believe the Executive Presidency still has the power to bring this situation under control, but the way it stands now, we will have to go back and seek the peoples mandate. Only that will solve the crisis. Go for a general election and bring in a new set of legislators, then no one can argue with that.
Q: The UNP also plans to bring in the 20th Amendment to abolish the Executive Presidency
A. If they had followed President JRJs thinking on this, we would not have had this situation. There are 10 points he made to a university convocation ceremony in 1978. He said, I am the first elected Executive President, head of state, head of government and since many others would succeed me, in my term of office, I wish to create precedents that are worthy of following.
First, I will only act through the Cabinet and Parliament preserving the Parliamentary system without diminishing their powers. Second, I will not create a group known as the Presidents men and women who will influence me.
This was on a request by Prof. Wilson to set up a separate office known as the Presidents Office like in the US where the President has his own team. He opposed it. He said, I will not appoint advisors and I will not create a separate office. I will always work though the Cabinet.
But we very clearly saw during President Rajapaksas time, advisors being appointed, a host of them, and, in effect, he created a Presidents Office. And this was why there was so much dissatisfaction in the Cabinet and there were breakaways in 2014.
President Sirisena is much less so, but former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe created his own team with the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) which was outside elected representation, taking decisions. They were bypassing Cabinet.
Q: How do you see the situation moving forward
A. A general election is the best option. There is precedence in Australia where in 1975 when the Governor General sacked the PM and appointed a caretaker PM. The former PM then went to Parliament and tried to get a vote of confidence and he was successful. But before the Speaker could deliver the decision on the vote of confidence to the Governor General, he dissolved Parliament and went in for an election. A new government thereafter came into power. It happened within a short time period and things were resolved.
But we have got ourselves into a bind because of the Supreme Court decision. But I think after December 7, this will start to resolve.
Q: Having spoken about your grandfather, you are now ironically representing the SLFP
A. I dont think my grandfather could have been in this UNP. It is not the UNP of my grandfather. Their policies are against the grain of the original UNP, and that is why they have gone down to 35 percent now. Only the diehard UNPers remain now.
Q: The UNP has once again said that they would field a common candidate at the next election. This is the third time they are doing this instead of fielding a UNPer
If he (Ranil Wickremesinghe) keeps going on like this, the UNP will become a fringe party unable to form a government without a coalition. And many are opportunistic. To bring back the original UNP will take a long time and the leadership will have to change, and you have to go back to the fundamentals of the UNP. Today, it has very little grassroots support. The only person who can truly claim to have grassroots support is Mahinda Rajapaksa and with him joining, the SLFPs issues have been resolved.
Further, if you look at Ranil Wickremesinghes behaviour over the last few decades, he has been trying to wipe away the legacy of JRJ. In 2001 when he was PM, he brought in a gazette to close down the Mahaweli project and it was President Sirisena, who, when he was Agriculture Minister, revived it.
A few months ago Ranil Wickremesinghe brought in a gazette to close down the JRJ Centre. He stopped its rental income and instead, he said he wanted to establish an institute to train Parliamentarians with funding from a German political group. The Act for this was drafted and brought into Parliament, but cancelled with the recent events. He also held a meeting at the JRJ Centre and said this is the last meeting of the JRJ Centre. And now, the Executive Presidency.

## Title: Afghan Opium cultivation down by 20 percent

Afghan Opium cultivation down by 20 percent
UN: A new United Nations survey finds that opium cultivation in Afghanistan has decreased by 20 percent in 2018 compared to the previous year, citing a severe drought and falling prices of dry opium at the national level.
The total opium-poppy cultivation area decreased to 263,000 hectares, from 328,000 hectares estimated in 2017, but it was
still the second highest measurement for Afghanistan since the U.N. Office on Drugs and Crime (UNODC) began monitoring in 1994.
The potential opium production decreased by 29 percent to 6,400 tons from an estimated 9,000 tons in 2017.
The UNODC country representative, Mark Colhoun, while explaining factors behind the reduction told reporters in Kabul the farm-gate prices of dry opium at the harvest time fell to $94 per kilogram, the lowest since 2004.
The decreases, in particular in the northern and western Afghan regions, were mainly attributed to the severe drought that hit the country during the course of the last year, he added.
Despite these decreases, the overall area under opium-poppy cultivation is still the highest ever recorded. This is a clear challenge to security and safety for the region and beyond. It is also a threat to all countries to and through which these drugs are trafficked as well as to Afghanistan itself, said Colhoun.
He warned that more high-quality low-cost heroin will reach consumer markets across the world, with increased consumption and related harms as a further likely consequence.
The significant levels of opium-poppy cultivation and illicit trafficking of opiates will further fuel instability, insurgency and increase funding to terrorist groups in Afghanistan, he said.
Colhoun noted that while there is no single explanation for the continuing high levels of opium-poppy cultivation, rule of law-related challenges such as political instability, lack of government control and security as well as corruption have been found to be among the main drivers of illicit cultivation.
The UNODC survey estimated that the total farm-gate value of opium production decreased by 56 percent to $604 million, which is equivalent to three percent of Afghanistans GDP, from $1.4 billion in 2017. The lowest prices strongly undermined the income earned from opium cultivation by farmers.
The study finds that 24 out of the 34 Afghan provinces grew the opium-poppy in 2018, the same number as in the previous year.
The survey found that 69 percent of the opium poppy cultivation took place in southern Afghanistan and the largest province of Helmand remained the leading opium-poppy cultivating region followed by neighboring Kandahar and Uruzgan and Nangarhar in the east.
It noted that opium poppy weeding and harvesting provided for the equivalent of up to 354,000 full-time jobs to rural areas in 2017.
A U.S. government agency, the Special Inspector General for Afghanistan Reconstruction (SIGAR), has noted in its latest report that as of September 30, Washingtons counternarcotics-related appropriations for the country had reached almost $9 billion.

Amitabh Bachchan pays off farmers loans worth $500,000
INDIA: Bollywood superstar Amitabh Bachchan says he has cleared farmers' loans worth more than than 40m rupees ($560,000; 436,000). He wrote on his blog on Tuesday that he had "taken care" of 1,398 farmers by paying off their debt, adding that he felt a "sense of accomplishment".
All of the farmers are from the northern state of Uttar Pradesh, where Bachchan was born. Tens of thousands of Indian farmers struggle with debt.
For decades now, the farming industry has been blighted by drought, the depletion of the water table, declining productivity and a lack of modernisation.
Farm suicides have been linked to these issues - at least 300,000 farmers have taken their lives since 1995.
Bachchan, who is 76, remains one of India's most popular and best-known actors. He cleared loans that were owed to the government-owned Bank of India, which has issued a "one time settlement document and certificate", according to his blog post. He said that he had paid dues worth more than 40m rupees.
"I shall wish of course to give these settlements, these confirmations that their loans have been paid off, personally," Bachchan wrote. Since it would difficult to bring all of the farmers to Mumbai city, where he lives, he said he had reserved a train coach to bring 70 of them to meet him to receive the bank documents. They are expected to arrive on November 26. - BBC

Australia edge India in confidence-boosting T20 win
Brisbane, Wednesday: Australia edged India by four runs for a nerve-wracking win in their opening Twenty20 Wednesday despite a gallant 76 from Shikhar Dhawan, giving them a huge confidence boost after a run of poor results.
With a rain-marred match in Brisbane reduced to 17 overs, the visitors were set 174 to win under the Duckworth-Lewis-Stern system after the hosts made 158-4, Glenn Maxwell top-scoring with 46.
India needed 13 off the last over from Marcus Stoinis, but in a desperate bid to get the runs two wickets fell and they missed the target.
It eased the pressure on Australia who have been struggling to find their feet after the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa in March.
They have endured a dire run of results since and had lost fours T20s before this one.
The boys played really well especially through the middle overs with the bat. They showed a lot of courage, said skipper Aaron Finch.
The bowling was outstanding under a lot of pressure. I was confident. Stoinis was the one I pencilled in to do that job at the end. He had clear plans and executed his plans really well.
Indian captain Virat Kohli called it an exciting see-saw battle.
A lot of Indians came to support us. It was a great atmosphere to play in, he said.
We bowled well and then they came back into the game with Stoinis and Maxy (Maxwell) batting well. And a really good knock from Shikhar (for us).
Dhawan opened the innings in the run chase and immediately began plundering the Australian attack, smashing two boundaries off Jason Behrendorffs opening over.
Behrendorff got the scalp of dangerman Rohit Sharma for seven, but there was no stopping Dhawan who hit 16 off one over to bring up his ninth T20 50 off just 28 balls.
Lokesh Rahul made 13 before he was cleverly stumped by Alex Carey, bringing Kohli to the crease to huge roars from the big Indian contingent.
But he didnt last long, gone for four with Chris Lynn taking a catch at third man off Adam Zampa. And Dhawan wasnt far behind, caught on the boundary ropes attempting an upper cut off Billy Stanlakes bowling.
It left Rishabh Pant and Dinesh Karthik needing to score 78 runs off 36 balls. They whittled it down to set up a nail-biting finish before succumbing to the pressure.
Earlier, Maxwell smacked four sixes in an explosive display before the heavens opened and the teams were called off by the umpires after 16.1 overs.
After an hour-long delay, they came back out to face five balls and Maxwell was out to the first of them, with Australia making 158-4.
Experienced bowlers Jasprit Bumrah and Bhuvneshwar Kumar had set the early tone, restricting Finch and DArcy Short to just 12 runs off the opening three overs after Kohli put them into bat.AFP

Broad, Bairstow in Englands line-up for third Test
Stuart Broad and Jonny Bairstow will feature in Englands third and final Test against Sri Lanka at the SSC starting on Friday at the expense of Jimmy Anderson and Sam Curran.
Englands highest Test wicket-taker, Anderson, has been rested, while all-rounder Curran has a minor side issue.
Broad will get his first airing of the tour at the SSC  the same ground where he made his debut in 2007  while Bairstow, who injured his ankle during a football exercise in a pre-series training session, is likely to get an opportunity to prove his credentials at No.3, with Ben Stokes, who batted at first drop in the second Test, likely to return to No.5.
During his absence, Bairstow has seen wicket-keeper Ben Foakes perform admirably with the gloves, and the Surrey youngster will retain keeping duties in the final outing of the tour.
I understand the reasoning behind it with the series already won, Anderson said after confirmation he would be rested. With the winter weve got ahead, it makes sense for Stuart to get some cricket. Hes not played for a while and its going to be a tough tour of the West Indies.
Its a good opportunity for him and the team. You have to look at the situation as well  its hard work for seamers here and its not like Ive been able to have a huge input on the games.
England have already won the three-match series, with their victory in the second Test in Kandy giving them a 2-0 lead.

ENGLAND TEAM FOR THIRD TEST: Rory Burns, Keaton Jennings, Jonny Bairstow, Joe Root (captain), Ben Stokes, Jos Buttler, Moeen Ali, Ben Foakes (wk), Adil Rashid, Jack Leach, Stuart Broad.

Chinese envoy highlights Lankas role in BRI
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan said close cooperation between Sri Lanka and China has made a greater contribution towards the development of Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka is one of the first countries to openly support and join the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI). In the last five years, in-depth exchanges and cooperation in various fields has blossomed under the BRI framework, he said.
The Chinese envoy in Colombo was speaking at the inauguration of the international seminar on the Belt and Road Initiative at Five Years  Regional and Global Dimensions at the BMICH to mark the 5th anniversary of BRI.
The pragmatic cooperation between our two countries has made a great contribution to Sri Lankas development, and also brought tangible benefits to our two countries and two peoples, the envoy said.
He said that the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka is a good example of the BRI practice.
The Ambassador added that the completion of the Norochcholai Power Station provided about 40 percent of the nations electricity supply, the Colombo Airport Expressway has brought great convenience to domestic and international travellers. The CICT has became the fastest growing container terminal in Asia.
He said the Moragahakanda Project, which is the biggest water reservoir in Sri Lanka, has brought great benefits to local agriculture and people.
Besides, the Colombo Port City, as well as the Hambantota Port and Industrial Park, are expected to become the new engines for Sri Lankan economic take-off, he said.
We are confident that as long as all countries could make joint efforts and constantly push forward BRI cooperation, it will bring more and better prospects to the world. As we all know, the BRI consists of Five Connectivities, among which Policy Connectivity is the start and Peoples Hearts Connectivity is the end, he said.
The Ambassador added that Sri Lankans can join hands with China, concentrate in promoting pragmatic cooperation under BRI framework for the betterment of the two nations.
Twenty one leading scholars from 10 countries, including China, Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Bangladesh, Nepal, Singapore, Spain, Greece and Kenya participated in the seminar.
About 300 representatives from various sectors of Sri Lanka and the diplomatic corps attended the event.
After Dr. Rong Ying (Vice President of the China Institute of International Studies) delivered a keynote speech, going through the last five years of the BRI and highlighting the future plan and emphasis of the initiative, the floor was given to scholars to discuss the initiative from national, regional and global perspectives.
Prof. Amal Jayawardena (Senior Professor of the Sir John Kotelawala Defence University) and Ambassador Bernard Goonetilleke (former Foreign Secretary and Chairman of the Pathfinder Foundation) chaired the panel discussions.
Subhashini Abeysinghe (Research Director of the Verit Research, Sri Lanka) refuted the so-called Chinese Debt Trap with evidence and figures, while Shalika Dias (Researcher and Lecturer, BCIS) analyzed the challenges and opportunities of BRI to Sri Lanka.
Muhammad Asif Noor (Director of the Institute of Peace and Diplomatic Studies, Islamabad) and Yasir Masood (Deputy Director, Centre of Excellence-CPEC Pakistan Institute of Development Economics) spoke about the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) and BRIs prospects and challenges for Pakistan.
Prof.Swaran Singh (Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi) stressed that the South Asian countries have all been involved in the BRI while its modalities also need to be adjusted accordingly for this region. Indian politician and columnist Sudheendra Kulkarni urged the Indian government to change the mindset and actively participate in the BRI.
Dr. Chan Hing Lee Henry (Senior Visiting Research Fellow, Cambodia Institute for Cooperation and Peace), Dr. George Tzogopoulos (Senior Research Fellow, Centre international de formation europenne, France) and Prof. Macharia Munene (United States International University- Africa, Kenya) did their professional representation on BRI from ASEAN, European and African perspectives. On the sidelines of the seminar, foreign scholars also visited the mega-projects under the framework of BRI, which are jointly built by China and Sri Lanka, including the Colombo Port City, the Colombo International Container Terminal (CICT) and the Hambantota Port.

Politicians visiting places of worship
We very often see politicians visiting places of worship. They very often go to temples, Hindu kovils, churches and mosques.
They go and meet religious leaders. Very often when accepting a new position, they will meet the religious leaders and obtain their blessings. This is very good.
When there is some political crisis, politicians visit temples and other places of worship.
When politicians visit temples, lot of publicity is given. When coming out of the temples, the journalists start asking various questions from the politicians.
After visiting a temple, any devotee will be very religious, very peaceful, very patient, very reasonable and very pleasant.
When we visit a temple we change our behaviour and try to be compassionate and peaceful.
This is not observed in our politicians. When coming out of the temples, sometimes they are not peaceful at all. They start criticising their opponents. They start attacking their opponents. Instead of talking about peace, compassion, religious feelings, helping others, forgiving others, they start scolding their opponents. This is an insult to the religious leader they met. It is an insult to the religious teachings.
We very kindly request to the politicians to behave in a better way when they visit places of worship. Do not use these holy places for your low grade politics. When you visit a holy place behave in a manner that shows some respect to the religious teachings.
Religion plays a very crucial and central role in everyones life. Religion guides us to the path of honesty, integrity, high morals and inspires us to live a righteous life.
Religion may be defined as a cultural system of designated behaviours and practices, worldviews, texts, sanctified places, prophecies, ethics or organisations that relates humanity to supernatural, transcendental, or spiritual elements.
Visits of politicians to temples should be more spiritual and meaningful. These visits should not have other low level motives. Enter or leave a holy place with due respect and with a peaceful and spiritual mind.

Dont interfere in our internal affairs, diplomats told
A group of former Sri Lankan Ambassadors and academics yesterday urged the International Community to let the present political crisis in the country be solved internally.
They pointed out that as per the provisions of UN Charter and the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations of 1961, it is not legal for foreign countries to interfere into the internal affairs of another State.
They stated this at a press conference held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute yesterday.
Head of the Department of Legal Studies of the Open University Dr. Raja Gunaratne said the involvement of foreign powers into the current political crisis in the country is nothing, but a naked interference.
Quoting some of the statements issued by countries such as the USA, UK, Canada and Australia and pointed out as to how they were violating these charters or conventions by urging President Sirisena to reconvene Parliament when it was dissolved earlier this month.
He also noted that as per the provisions of the Vienna Convention of 1961, head of any mission or any member of the diplomatic staff of the mission could be declared as persona non grata or not acceptable by the receiving state if they interfered with the internal affairs of that country. Such an incident was reported in 1991 when the then President Ranasinghe Premadasa declared the then UK Ambassador to Sri Lanka a persona non grata for involving themselves into domestic affairs. This is an utter violation of international principles, Dr. Gunaratne said.
Senior Attorney-at-Law, Kanishka Vitharana speaking about the two No-Confidence Motions moved and passed against the Mahinda Rajapaksa government said that there is no legal validity of these motions as they had been moved inconsistent with the Standing Orders.
According to him, the motion by the Opposition to suspend Standing Orders also should have been moved in accordance with the provisions in the Standing Orders but, they had been failed to do so. Therefore, Witharana said that neither the motions on suspending the Standing Orders nor the No-Confidence Motion had been moved in an acceptable manner to Parliament. Former ambassador to the UAE and Israel, attorney Sarath Wijesinghe said since Sri Lanka is a very senior member of the United Nations and a member state of the Vienna Convention, the international community should not interfere with the countrys domestic affairs.
We are friendly with everybody and angry with none is the thesis of our foreign policy, he added.
Former ambassador Laksiri Mendis expressing his views on the constitutional provisions on the dissolution of the Parliament by the President said that there is a clash with regard to the power vested with the President on dissolution of the Parliament in the Article 33 (2) and the 70 (1) of the Constitution. However, he was of the opinion that the Article 70 (1), which was brought under the 19th constitutional amendment, is an odd provision and he had not seen such provision in any Commonwealth country.
The 19th Amendment did not resolve the constitutional issues. The drafters have not transferred the presidential system to a parliamentary system through this amendment. In this context, it is my firm believe that the 19 Amendment must be replaced by a new 19th Amendment, he said.

The Mines Advisory Group (MAG) is delighted to welcome members of the England cricket team to its operations in Periyamadu, in the North-West of Sri Lanka on November 19.
Following their test match, cricketers Joe Root (Captain), Jonny Bairstow, Keaton Jennings and Olly Stone will visit an area where MAG is clearing landmines. They will then play cricket with children at a nearby school.
Demining is a vital undertaking in Sri Lanka, supporting post-conflict peacebuilding and reconciliation efforts directly and indirectly. The UK government has been funding this work through the Conflict, Stability, and Security Fund (CSSF) with nearly 2.5m of support since 2016.
Jane Cocking, MAGs Chief Executive said: Sixty million people around the world live in fear of landmines and unexploded bombs  with someone killed or injured every hour. Almost half are children".
By visiting a minefield today the players are highlighting how this urgent issue impacts communities in Sri Lanka and around the world.
Our target is to support Sri Lanka to become landmine free by 2020, so there will be no more minefields here to visit, and no more accidents and fear.
This visit is being delivered in close coordination with the British High Commission in Sri Lanka, and will be attended by the High Commissioner, James Dauris: Its hard for most people to imagine what its like when, every time you go for a walk or see your
children playing with their friends, you worry that someone will get killed or badly injured. Yet this is what it has been like for years for all those people in Sri Lanka who live in areas where there are still landmines in the ground a decade after fighting ended.
Everyone in the UK can be proud of the contribution we are making towards Sri Lanka becoming landmine free again. Clearing the land of mines means that local people can go back to living normal lives without having to worry all the time about the risks of a potentially fatal injury. This brave and painstaking work makes it safe for people to return to their homes and their fields, and allows communities to rebuild. It allows young people to come together and to play cricket without fear.
Im delighted that todays visit by members of the England Cricket Team will raise awareness of the vital work that UK charities, including MAG and the Halo Trust, are doing in Sri Lanka with the support of the UK Government.

Examining the Four Noble Truths
Life in any world is unstable, it is swept away, it has no shelter and protector,nothing of its own. Inextricably tied up with impermanence and suffering is a third principle intrinsic to all phenomena of existence. This is the characteristic of non-self (anatta), and the three together are called the three marks orcharacteristics (tilakkhana)
The Four Noble Truths structure the entire teaching of the Buddha, containing its many other principles just as the elephants footprint contains the footprints of all other animals.
The pivotal notion around which the truths revolve is that of dukkha, translated here as suffering. The Pali word originally meant simply pain and suffering, a meaning it retains in the texts when it is used as a quality of feeling: in these cases it has been rendered as pain or painful.
As the first noble truth, however, dukkha has a far wider significance, reflective of a comprehensive philosophical vision. While it draws its affective coloring from its connection with pain and suffering, and certainly includes these, it points beyond such restrictive meanings to the inherent unsatisfactoriness of everything conditioned. This unsatisfactoriness of the conditioned is due to its impermanence, its vulnerability to pain, and its inability to provide complete and lasting satisfaction.
The Buddhas teaching
The notion of impermanence (anicca) forms the bedrock for the Buddhas teaching, having been the initial insight that impelled the Bodhisattva to leave the palace in search of a path to enlightenment. Impermanence, in the Buddhist view, comprises the totality of conditioned existence, ranging in scale from the cosmic to the microscopic. At the far end of the spectrum the Buddhas vision reveals a universe of immense dimensions evolving and disintegrating in repetitive cycles throughout beginning-less time.
In the middle range the mark of impermanence comes to manifestation in our inescapable mortality, our condition of being bound to aging, sickness, and death, of possessing a body that is subject to being worn and rubbed away, to dissolution and disintegration. And at the close end of the spectrum, the Buddhas teaching discloses the radical impermanence uncovered only by sustained attention to experience in its living immediacy: the fact that all the constituents of our being, bodily and mental, are in constant process, arising and passing away in rapid succession from moment to moment without any persistent underlying substance. In the very act of observation they are undergoing destruction, vanishing, fading away, and ceasing.
This characteristic of impermanence that marks everything conditioned leads directly to the recognition of the universality of dukkha or suffering.
The Buddha underscores this all-pervasive aspect of dukkha when, in his explanation of the first noble truth, he says, In short, the five aggregates affected by clinging are suffering. The five aggregates affected by clinging are a classificatory scheme that the Buddha had devised for demonstrating the composite nature of personality.
The scheme comprises every possible type of conditioned state, which it distributes into five categories  material form, feeling, perception, mental formations, and consciousness.
The aggregate of material form (rupa) includes the physical body with its sense faculties as well as external material objects. The aggregate of feeling (vedanda) is the affective element in experience, either pleasant, painful, or neutral. Perception (sanna), the third aggregate, is the factor responsible for noting the qualities of things and also accounts for recognition and memory.
The formations aggregate (sankhara) is an umbrella term that includes all volitional, emotive, and intellective aspects of mental life. And consciousness (vinnana), the fifth aggregate, is the basic awareness of an object indispensable to all cognition. As the venerable Sariputta shows in his masterly analysis of the first noble truth, representatives of all five aggregates are present on every occasion of experience, arising in connection with each of the six sense faculties and their objects.
The Buddhas statement that the five aggregates are dukkha thus reveals that the very things we identify with and hold to as the basis for happiness, rightly seen, are the basis for the suffering that we dread. Even when we feel ourselves comfortable and secure, the instability of the aggregates is itself a source of oppression and keeps us perpetually exposed to suffering in its more blatant forms.
Subject to change
The whole situation becomes multiplied further to dimensions beyond calculation when we take into account the Buddhas disclosure of the fact of rebirth. All beings in whom ignorance and craving remain present wander on in the cycle of repeated existence, samsara, in which each turn brings them the suffering of new birth, ageing, illness, and death. All states of existence within samsara, being necessarily transitory and subject to change, are incapable of providing lasting security.
Life in any world is unstable, it is swept away, it has no shelter and protector, nothing of its own. Inextricably tied up with impermanence and suffering is a third principle intrinsic to all phenomena of existence. This is the characteristic of non-self (anatta), and the three together are called the three marks or characteristics (tilakkhana).

Farmers in Anuradhapura have been facing a fertiliser shortage for a long time following the drought that lasted for over one-and-a-half years. They mainly lack Triple Super Phosphate (TSP).
Therefore, they are have been unable continue cultivation activities for the 2018/2019 Maha season although they had received an adequate amount of water through the recent monsoonal rains.
Anuradhapura Agrarian Development Department Assistant Commissioner Asanka Somawansa said the the Lak Pohora company had not provided sufficient TSP subsidies on time.
He said that aside from the Lak Pohora company, the Colombo Commercial Company was also responsible for providing TSP, muriate of potash (MOP) and urea to the Agrarian Development Department. Somawansa said the issue would be solved soon as a ship carrying fertiliser stocks was scheduled to arrive at Sri Lanka on November 27.
It had also been reported that traders in the open market had refused to sell fertiliser subsidies after its price was changed from Rs.1,500 to Rs.1,000 per 50-kilogram sack; they had said that it was not guaranteed that they would be reimbursed for the Rs.500 price gap.
There had also been allegations that certain traders had attempted to extort farmers into buying urea subsidies before they could purchase TSP or MOP.
Somawansa said that agriculture research and development assistants had been instructed to look into the matter with the assistance of the National Fertiliser Secretariat.

Five precepts: Virtues with benefits guaranteed Venerable Inginimitiye
Five precepts are the permanent virtue of the laymen. Like a hand-rail, they benefit modern society. The precepts include refraining from killing living beings, taking what is not given, sexual misconduct, uttering falsehood and consuming intoxicating drinks. Ethnic distinctions, religions and castes do not matter when it comes to observing five precepts.
The non-Buddhists can also gain benefits by observing the five precepts. You do not only need to stay away from these sinful affairs but also be friendly, compassionate and kindhearted.
These five precepts have common elements with most moral conducts in other major traditions. Some aspects, especially the precept to refrain from taking life, have been a continuing focus of attention throughout the history of Buddhism. Today, we shall explore them in depth through teachings from between the fifth and the twentieth centuries.
In the five precepts, taking life means to murder anything that lives. It refers to the striking and killing of living beings. Taking life is the will to kill anything that one perceives as having life, to act so as to terminate the life-force in it, in so far as the will finds expression in bodily action or in speech. With regard to animals, it is worse to kill large ones than small. Because a more extensive effort is involved. Even where the effort is the same, the difference in substance must be considered.
In the case of humans, the killing is the more blameworthy the more virtuous they are. Apart from that, the extent of the offence is proportionate to the intensity of the wish to kill. Five factors are involved: a living being, the perception of a living being, a thought of murder, the action of carrying it out, and death as a result of it. And six are the ways in which the offence may be carried out: with ones own hand, by instigation, by missiles, by slow poisoning, by sorcery, by psychic power.
To take what is not given means the appropriation of what is not given. It refers to the removing of someone elses property, to the stealing of it, to theft. What is not given means that which belongs to someone else. Taking what is not given is then the will to steal anything that one perceives as belonging to someone else, and to act so as to appropriate it. Its blameworthiness depends partly on the value of the property stolen, partly on the worth of its owner. Five factors are involved: someone elses belongings, the awareness that they are someone elses, the thought of theft, the action of carrying it out, the taking away as a result of it. This sin, too, may be carried out in six ways. One may also distinguish unlawful acquisition by way of theft, robbery, underhand dealings, stratagems, and the casting of lots.
Sensuous misconduct  here sensuous means sexual, and misconduct is extremely blameworthy bad behaviour. Sensuous misconduct is the will to transgress against those whom one should not go into, and the carrying out of this intention by unlawful physical action. By those one should not go into, first of all men are meant. And then also twenty kinds of women. Ten of them are under some form of protection, by their mother, father, parents, brother, sister, family, clan, co-religionists, by having been claimed from birth onwards, or by the kings law.
The other ten kinds are: women bought with money, concubines for the fun of it, kept women, women bought by the gift of a garment, concubines who have been acquired by the ceremony which consists in dipping their hands into water, concubines who once carried burdens on their heads, slave girls who are also concubines, servants who are also concubines, girls captured in war, temporary wives. The offence is the more serious, the more moral and virtuous the person transgressed against. It involves four factors: someone who should not be gone into, the thought of cohabiting with that one, the actions which lead to such cohabitation, and its actual performance. There is only one way of carrying it out: with ones own body.
False speech is the will to deceive others by words or deeds. One can also explain: False means something which is not real, not true. Speech is the intimation that that is real or true. False speech is then the volition which leads to the deliberate intimation to someone else that something is so when it is not so.
The last of the five precepts is to refrain from taking intoxicants that cloud the mind and cause heedlessness. This means drugs and alcohol (but not prescription medication). This precept is a traditional way of detoxifying our bodies and minds. And it can be challenging at events where alcohol is considered a means of socialization and relaxation. However, with commitment, these situations often prove to be less awkward than we had feared. The benefits of keeping the vow turn out to be even more fruitful than we had hoped.

Forecasting system to assist farmers in crop management
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed the Agriculture Department authorities to prepare a Crop Forecast Information System to prevent some of the main issues faced by farmers, especially small-scale farmers.
Minister Amaraweera said most farmers cannot sell their produce at a good price due to the absence of a proper Crop Forecast Information System and mediators take the advantage of this situation.
The Minister said the Crop Forecast System would helpful for proper crop management. The cultivation of crops without any management creates various issues including harvesting losses and the reduction of prices.
If we have a Crop Forecast Information System, we would also be able to predict an excess of harvest of vegetables, grains and fruits and we will be able to provide necessary measures to export or produce value added food products. Then farmers would be able to get a better price for their produce, he said.

IGP has prerogative over transfers
The transfer of Criminal Investigation Departments OIC, IP Nishantha Silva was a transfer over which only the Inspector General has prerogative over and nothing to do with President Maithripala Sirisena, Police sources told the Daily News.
IP Nishantha Silva who handled several high profile cases involving high ranking officials in the government sector and tri-forces, was transferred to the Negombo Division with immediate effect.
Inspector General Pujith Jayasundara however told the Daily News that the transfer was cancelled by him citing service requirements.
Sources told the Daily News that transfers of OICs of stations and certain divisions do not require National Police Commission approval.The transfer of IP Silva was the prerogative of the IGP, who is vested with powers to transfer personnel based on service requirements or vacancies.
He denied the involvement of NPC or higher ranking officials adding that the IGP makes such transfers on a regular basis which often goes unnoticed.
IP Silva was the OIC of the CIDs Organized Crimes Unit handling many high profile cases including the murder of Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge and abduction of journalist Keith Noyahr. The daughter of late Wickrematunge, Ahimsa wrote to the President asking him to reconsider the transfer of IP Silva, citing that it was his efforts which helped further the case.
IP Silva is also handling investigations into crimes committed by the LTTE, the rape and murder of schoolgirl Sivaloganathan Vithya, the abduction of 11 youth in Colombo among many.

JVP, UNP, TNA playing with a stacked deck
Global and South East Region political analysts and non-interference policy scholars yesterday charged the United National Party,the Tamil National Alliance and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna as playing with a stacked deck of cards in Parliament putting peoples sovereignty at stake.
The former government led by United National Party leader Ranil Wickremesinghe has fulfilled needs of hegemonic powers rather than needs of Sri Lankan public, said the analysts. .
The government of Wickremesinghe has seen the setting up of an Office on Missing Persons to punish soldiers, which was not one of their election pledges, the pointed out.
They promised the people to establish democracy, but have not held elections on time.
The former government was comprehensively beaten in the last local government election by a new political party, Sri Lanka Podu Jana Peramuna which represented Joint Opposition in Parliament, critics pointed out..
The UNP, The JVP and the TNA did not have a program for the country at the Presidential Election of 2015, except they convened with the backing of the so called international community, to dispel Mahinda Rajaksa from Presidency, said Foreign Affairs analist Mohan Samaranayaka.
The hegemonic powers backed the UNP, TNA, and JVP to dislodge President Mahinda Rajpaksa because they do not like ascendance of independent governments in the Asian region. Rajapaksa turned down a request from Western powers to stop the war. They did not want Rajapaksa-China relations to blossom because of Chinas increasing economic power China is fast becoming a super economic power, he explained.
The United National Party chose a common candidate in the Sri Lanka Freedom Party, who is the current President of the country; because it knew it could not win any elections on its own or with their leaders, he said.
The JVP has become vociferous of late about Parliament democracy but they did not say anything against the Speaker when he appointed the Opposition in Parliament for 16 seats of the TNA against 57 held by the Joint Opposition. Moreover, the JVP did not raise their voices when President Maithripala Sirisena who they vehemently criticize nowadays over appointing Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister, anointed Ranil Wickremesinghe who had only 41 seats in Parliament as the Prime Minister.
Political analysts said the JVP has maintained double standards right from the beginning with regard to upholding Parliamentary traditions and maxims. They have one for Ranil and another for Mahinda Rajapaksa. The reason for this is that the JVP members get benefits from these Western powers as would do by UNP and TNA.
A come back of a Rajapaksa regime is the last thing that these three political parties want. The UNP, the JVP and the TNA cannot afford to disappoint these Western powers. These powers are using members of Tamil National Alliance cause tensions in the countrys political map, they said. .
They are dependent on the support of these powers to set up a federal structure of governance in the countrys North and East.
Whenever there is a problem, they go to embassies seeking their advice with concerns to how they should act. When they stay neutral the UNP and the Opposition will be at loggerheads with each other. This pattern seems to go on and on.
President Sirisena sacked Wickremesinghe and appointed Rajapaksa as Prime Minister because he had untimately to go before the people who voted him.
The President exercises powers vested in him by the people who are sovereign. The legislature, the Executive and the judiciary exercise powers inherited from that sovereignty. It is primarily exercised by the public.
JVP ,UNP and TNA have carried out a regime change program since the defeat of the LTTE. Mahinda Rajapaksa was a target because he is an independent person, more than anything else,he said.

Kandy SCs two matches  a review
Kandy, the defending champions extended their winning performance in their first two games of the new Dialog rugby league against Air Force SC and Police SC to keep their unbeaten record intact carried forward from the previous year.
Kandy SC has a well-balanced side and coached by Sean Wijesinghe and Fazil Marija past captains of the club. However the rugby that was put on show in the last two games was not all that convincing even though they won. If they continue to play in this fashion, it is going to be hard for them to retain the cup this season. They are expected to give a better display in their third game against Army SC on Saturday at Ratmalana.
Kandy SC forwards are knowledgeable and good thinkers of the game when compared to the other teams, they are fast on their feet and good in both defence and attack. The halves combination should make use of the good possession their forwards win for them and run and feed their fast three-quarters to score tries as they did last season. They have a huge potential and capable of giving their best, but some hoodoo seems to be prevailing on their good run and pass rugby. It is time they settled down to play some solid rugby to recapture the past glory.
In the first game, against Air Force SC at Ratmalana, though they won 28 points to 19 , the rugby on display that afternoon was very disappointing as they provided some mediocre rugby. Kandy didnt have to wait too long for points, in the 30th second they scored their first points. From here the opponents were very impressive and gave the Kandy SC a good fight, the Airmen indulged in some good rugby and were running the ball at random to the viewing pleasure of their supporters. Kandy S.C. players shone well in patches and earned the points through tries from Vishvamithra Jayasinghe, Roshan Weeraratna and Richard Dharmapala who scored twice and four conversions by Thilina Wijesinghe
In the second game against Police SC last Saturday at Nittawela Kandy had to produce a hard fought performance to outwit their opponents by 32 points to 23. It was a superb performance by the cops who offered some exciting moments of overturning Kandy. It became a tough game from the first whistle. The Police forwards defence was excellent , that helped them to dominate forward play on and off.
In this game at their home den, much was expected from Kandy but they failed to deliver, they got some good possessions, but due to unforeseen errors it turned out to be a grim day for them. They seemed to be little frustrated as they couldnt penetrate their opponents territory, but at the same time they were really proud of the way they hung in and won the game.
The points scorers for Kandy were , three from Danushka Ranjan and one from Yakoob Ali and the goal kicking part was off he boot of Thilina Wijesinghe and Arshad Jamaldeen.
The present table standing 1) Kandy SC 12 points, (2) Havelock SC 11 points, (3) CR & FC 10 points , (4) Army SC 6 points, (5), Navy SC 6 points (6) CH & FC 2 points, (7) Police SC 1 point.
The Kandy SC squad comprises Chamika Perera, Vishwamihra Jayasinghe, Nipuna Tharaka, Malitha Wijesundara, Gayan Weeraratne, Omantah Panchiyawatte, Imad Reyal, Damith Dissanayake, Richard Dharmapala (team leader), Shehan Pathirana, Oshan Perera, Buwenaka Udangamuwa, Thilina Wijesinghe, Jason Dissanayake, Nigel Ratwatte, Lavanga Perera, Danushka Ranjan, Lasitha Aththanagoda, Danusha Dayan, Asitha Ratnayake, Yaqoob Ali, Piyumal Manchanayake, Arshad Jamaldeen, Sashika Jayawardene, Uchitha Jayasuriya, Anurudda Wilwara, Ganuka Dissanayake, Tharindu Chathuranga, Sanushka Abeyawickrema, Suhiru Anthony, Heshan Kalhara, Srinath Sooriyabandara, Ashan Darling, Heshan Jansen, Diluksha Dange, Laksitha Ranawera, Kasun Srinath, (Coaching staff) Sean Wijesinghe (Head), Fazil Marija (Asst.

Katina festival as celebrated in Thailand
The month beginning on the full-moon day of Vap and ending on the full-moon day of Il  is traditionally known as the cheevaramaasa, (month of robes). This is the period in which new robes are offered to the Sanghaand this ancient ceremonial offering is called the Katina puja. The Katina ceremony is the culmination of the Vas season and it is a great occasion in the religious life of Sinhala Buddhists.
This practice continues at the same period of the year, in countries to which Buddhism has spread, although it may not be a season of rain in some of those countries. The Katina ceremonies have continued through the ages and have evolved from culture to culture. The traditions of Theravada Buddhism spread throughout Southeast Asia as Buddhism won the favour of ruling monarchs in Myanmar, Laos, Cambodia, and Thailand.
Sukhothai Inscriptions
Let us take, for example, Thailand. Buddhism was introduced to Thailand by King Asoka in during the 3rd century B.C. It was the same time Buddhism was introduced to Sri Lanka. Just like Sri Lanka, Buddhism established itself in Thailand and developed very rapidly. However, three centuries later, Mahayana started to became powerful in Far East countries and during the reign of King Kanishka in the second half of the first century A.D., it began to settle down in Thailand too.
Theravada Buddhism was re-established in Thailand under the patronage of KingRamkhamhaeng. He is credited with firm establishment of Theravada Buddhism as the state religion of the kingdom.He reigned between 12791298. Sukhothai Inscriptionsconfirm the arrival of the original Lankavongse(Sri Lanka) sect of Buddhism to Sukhothai via Nakhon Si Thammarat in the reign of King Ramkhamhaeng. That monarch selected Buddhist teachings. Later when the newly modified Lankavongse sect of Buddhism and religious beliefs from Lanna Kingdom spread to Sukhothai, the period of "faith leading wisdom" came. Theravada Buddhism that was introduced during this period in time is still a part of the current Thai culture. It has gone through some challenges, but has been able to get back on its feet each time. The Theravada Buddhism in Thailand is now known as Lankavamsa.
Kathina ceremony
Today in Thailand, the Kathina ceremony provides one of the most popular occasions for merit-making. The Buddhist people celebrate this robe- offering ceremony with profound respect and devotion to the monks, who have just spent three months in the monastery observing the Khao Pansa (Vassana).
In rural Thailand, everybody in a village will participate in the Kathina ceremony as a community activity which may last anywhere from one day to as many as three days. Thekathina ceremonies will include events that reinforce commitments to such Buddhist values as generosity, selflessness, and charity. The highlight of the kathina ceremony is the presentation of gifts and new robes to the Buddhist monks in local temples and monasteries.
The kathina ceremony is an important opportunity for villagers to gain merit. While the villagers prepare foods and material gifts for the monks, a principal donor, a wealthy person from a larger community, may provide the bulk of the support. The reason wealthy donors sponsor kathinas in the villages is that they often believe that rural monasteries may follow monastic ideals more closely than urban ones do.
A typical kathina celebration might include a procession featuring musical groups with traditional instruments such as horns, drums, and cymbals. Alternatively, school bands might play music. In some cases, dancers are part of the procession and marchers may process in traditional costumes. Traditions vary.

Killing the bogey
The attempts by the UNP led Opposition to have economic and political sanctions imposed on the country together with a travel ban on the President and Prime Minister, it appears had made not the slightest impact, with diplomatic sources quoted by our newspaper, in its main story, denying any such move on the part of their countries. No discussions were held at international level to impose economic or political sanctions against the Sri Lankan Government nor were there any travel ban imposed on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa or Government Ministers our report quoted diplomatic sources as having stated. They also held the view that economic and political sanctions or a travel ban may be imposed on countries if there is sufficient evidence that the country concerned had committed crimes which violate its criminal law, or the questionable behaviour of such countries within the ambit of the global political arena.
The Opposition, since the October 26 regime change, have been busy as ants trying to get Sri Lanka censured by the international community. Frenetic activity was seen where prominent members of the Opposition were shown in huddles with western ambassadors obviously selling false bogeys to the diplomatic community. Among them were current Opposition Leader R. Sambandan, TNA spokesman M. A. Sumanthiran and SLMC leader Rauff Hakeem. This, no doubt, was with the intention of painting a wrong picture of the political developments and to demonize the President and the Prime Minister. UNP stalwarts, in the daily press briefings, aired from Temple Trees, were talking about cancellation of hotel bookings by tourists and flight of foreign capital from the bourse. They were constantly harping on the theme of an illegal Government in existence and of grim forebodings to the country as a consequence. They claimed that Sri Lanka was on the verge of losing the GSP Plus facility and foreign aid that was in the pipeline had been put on hold. Sri Lanka, these spokesmen claimed, had been ostracized vis-a-vis the international community and now risked being labelled a pariah state.
However, it appears that all this rhetoric and bad mouthing of ones own country has not had the desired effect, going by the response of the diplomatic community.
Besides, nothing that has happened in this country since October 26 warranted the imposition of economic sanctions or a travel ban on the countrys leaders. The President acted well within the powers vested in him by the constitution. There was no bloodshed, barring a few incidents that are commonplace in this country during a change of Government. Democracy is in no way in peril since an opportunity was presented for the people to exercise their franchise.
Anyway it was the UNP led Opposition which is standing in the way of order being restored by its antics in stubbornly refusing to accept the legitimate Government. Nay, it is former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who is bringing the country into ridicule by refusing to vacate Temple Trees and ceding the Prime Ministers official residence to the present incumbent. Exacerbating matters is the Speaker who is adamantly sticking to his guns in refusing to accept the new regime.
The unpatriotic nature of the UNPs actions can be gauged from the manner in which party stalwarts keep on listing out the sanctions that are to be imposed on the country as if they wish for gloom to descend on the Motherland. They forget that the sanctions would affect every citizen, including those supporting the UNP. Anyway patriotism had never been the strong point of the Greens if one were to recall the agreements entered into with the LTTE to the detriment of the security forces and the country. Besides, the consequences of economic sanctions could also one day come to haunt the party if and when it ever captures power.
Like the Ven. Dr. Malwane Chandrarathana Thera, Dean of the Sinhala Faculty of the Kelaniya University said, if either the Opposition or any other party requests foreign countries or the diplomatic community to impose economic sanctions on the country, it is a disgrace to ones Motherland. If anybody makes such a request, that request itself manifests ones own hatred and what the international community should do is to extend help to that country to rise up and move forward the Ven. Thera was quoted as saying, in same news report.
In any event, from observations made in the past, the west is slow to impose economic sanctions on countries who had strayed from the path-at least in their eyes. There had been calls for imposing sanctions on countries such as Pakistan (during the rule of military dictator Zia ul Haq) and recently the Maldives for acting against democratic norms and also Myanmar during the junta rule for violation of human rights. Although threats were made no sanctions were imposed. On the contrary Pakistan was the recipient of unprecedented aid from the Regan administration both, economic and military. Therefore Sri Lanka can rests assured that our traditional donors would not jump to cut off aid to the country nor the west to impose economic sanctions as much as the Opposition may wish for it.

Lahiru to be freed soon
It is three years and a month since Lahiru Madusanka Manikkandura has been incarcerated at the Maafushi Prison in the Maldives, but he may soon taste freedom again, thanks to the efforts of Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
Provincial Councils, Local Government and Sports Minister Faiszer Musthapha attended the recent inauguration of newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, where he once again reiterated his position to secure Lahirus release.
The promise of Lahirus release was renewed and it is now anticipated that he will be released in the next few days.
Lahiru Madusanka Manikkandura, better known as Lahiru, was incriminated with the charge of plotting to assassinate former Maldivian President Abdullah Yameen Abdul Gayoom. He was accused of being a former Sri Lankan military officer with specialised training in sniping.
However, Lahiru was persistent in stating that he was innocent. At the time of his arrest, he claimed that he was recently married with a one-year-old son (now four years old), and was on the lookout for a job in the Maldives.
He had travelled to the Maldives on the promise of employment, but instead, he was framed with a major crime.
When the trial began, it was conducted in Dhivehi (the official language of Maldives), and Lahiru understood very little.
He was later given a translator. Allegations of torture had also sprung up by various pressure groups.
The Sri Lankan government constantly maintained an eye for Lahiru although there were profound limitations in respect of matters within their control.
Recently, Minister Musthapha intervened in the case and took the matter up with former Maldivian President Mohamed Nasheed and newly elected President Ibrahim Mohamed Solih.
His efforts immediately bore fruit considering the good relationship between the parties negotiating and the countries concerned.
However, as the due process had already been initiated, Minister Musthapha also had discussions with the Attorney-General and the Maldivian Home Affairs Ministry.
The efforts yielded positive results and the Maldives promised that Lahiru would soon be released from the Maafushi Prison in the Maldives.

Significance of Il Full Moon Poya:
Last debt paid
Arahant Sariputta is a famous name in Buddhist literature among a few others: Moggallana, his colleague and Ananda, the Buddhas chief assistant. Sariputtas story starts in a village of brahmins, being born to Sari in Upatissa village. The brahmin priests named him after his hometown Upatissa.
Although Sariputta later became a monk followed by his siblings, his mother could never know the Buddhas teachings.
Bhikkhu Nanamoli describes a full length picture of Arahant Sariputta according to the Pali Canons. Where the arahant converts his mother is named as Last Debt Paid. Excerpts:
During his journey the Venerable Sariputta spent one night wherever he stopped, and thus for one week he favored many people with a last sight of him. Reaching Nalaka village in the evening, he stopped near a banyan tree at the village gate. It happened that at the time a nephew of the elder, Uparevata by name, had gone outside the village and there he saw the Venerable Sariputta. He approached the elder, saluted him, and remained standing.
The Elder asked him: Is your grand-aunt at home
Yes, venerable sir, he replied.
Then go and announce our coming, said the Elder. And if she asks why I have come, tell her that I shall stay in the village for one day, and ask her to prepare my birth chamber and provide lodgings for five hundred bhikkhus.
Uparevata went to his grand-aunt and said: Grandaunt, my uncle has come.
Where is he now she asked.
At the village gate.
Is he alone, or has someone else come with him
He has come with five hundred bhikkhus.
And when she asked him, Why has he come he gave her the message the elder had entrusted to him. Then she thought: Why does he ask me to provide lodgings for so many After becoming a monk in his youth, does he want to be a layman again in his old age But she arranged the birth chamber for the Elder and lodgings for the bhikkhus, had torches lit and then sent for the Elder.
The Venerable Sariputta then, accompanied by the bhikkhus, went up to the terrace of the house and entered his birth chamber. After seating himself, he asked the bhikkhus to go to their quarters. They had hardly left, when a grave illness, dysentery, fell upon the Elder, and he felt severe pains. When one pail was brought in, another was carried out. The brahman lady thought: The news of my son is not good, and she stood leaning by the door of her own room.
And then it happened, the text tells us, that the Four Great Divine Kings asked themselves: Where may he now be dwelling, the Marshal of the Law And they perceived that he was at Nalaka, in his birth chamber, lying on the bed of his Final Passing Away. Let us go for a last sight of him, they said.
When they reached the birth chamber, they saluted the Elder and remained standing.
Who are you asked the Elder.
We are the Great Divine Kings, venerable sir.
Why have you come
We want to attend on you during your illness.
Let it be! said the Venerable Sariputta. There is an attendant here. You may go.
When they had left, there came in the same manner Sakka the king of the gods, and after him, Maha Brahma, and all of them the elder dismissed in the same way.
The brahman lady, seeing the coming and going of these deities, asked herself: Who could they have been, who came and paid homage to my son, and then left And she went to the door of the elders room and asked the Venerable Cunda for news about the Elders condition. Cunda conveyed the inquiry to the Elder, telling him: The Great Upasika (lay devotee) has come.
The Venerable Sariputta asked her: Why have you come at this unusual hour
To see you, dear, she replied. Tell me, who were those who came first
The Four Great Divine Kings, upasika.
Are you, then, greater than they she asked.
They are like temple attendants, said the Elder. Ever since our Master took rebirth they have stood guard over him with swords in hand.
After they had left, who was it that came then, dear
It was Sakka the king of the gods.
Are you then, greater than the king of gods, dear
He is like a novice who carries a bhikkhus belongings, answered Sariputta. When our Master returned from the heaven of the Thirty-three (Tavatimsa), Sakka took his bowl and robe and descended to earth together with him.
And when Sakka had gone, who was it that came after him, filling the room with his radiance
Upasika, that was your own Lord and Master, the Great Brahma.
Then are you greater, my son, even than my Lord, the Great Brahma
Yes, Upasika. On the day when our Master was born, it is said that four Great Brahmas received the Great Being in a golden net.
Upon hearing this, the brahman lady thought: If my sons power is such as this, what must be the majestic power of my sons Master and Lord And while she was thinking this, suddenly the fivefold rapture arose in her, suffusing her entire body.
The Elder thought: Rapture and joy have arisen in my mother. Now is the time to preach the Dhamma to her. And he said: What was it you were thinking about, upasika
I was thinking, she replied, if my son has such virtue, what must be the virtue of his Master
The Venerable Sariputta answered: At the moment of my Masters birth, at his Great Renunciation (of worldly life), on his attaining Enlightenment and at his first turning of the Dhamma Wheel  on all these occasions the ten thousand world-system quaked and shook. None is there who equals him in virtue, in concentration, in wisdom, in deliverance, and in the knowledge and vision of deliverance. And he then explained to her in detail the words of homage: Such indeed is that Blessed One... (Iti pi so Bhagava...). And thus he gave her an exposition of the Dhamma, basing it on the virtues of the Buddha.
Last breath
(as continued in The Life of Sariputta)
When the Dhamma talk given by her beloved son had come to an end, the brahman lady was firmly established in the Fruition of stream-entry, and she said: Oh, my dear Upatissa, why did you act like that Why, during all these years, did you not bestow on me this ambrosia (the knowledge of the Deathless)
The Elder thought: Now I have given my mother, the brahman lady Rupa-Sari, the nursing-fee for bringing me up. This should suffice. and he dismissed her with the words: You may go now, upasika.
When she was gone, he asked: What is the time now, Cunda
Venerable sir, it is early dawn.
And the Elder said: Let the community of bhikkhus assemble.
When the bhikkhus had assembled, he said to Cunda: Lift me up to a sitting position, Cunda. And Cunda did so.
Then the Elder spoke to the bhikkhus, saying: For forty-four years I have lived and traveled with you, my brethren. If any deed or word of mine was unpleasant to you, forgive me, brethren.
And they replied: Venerable sir, not the least displeasure has ever come from you to us, who followed you inseparably like your shadow. But may you, venerable sir, grant forgiveness to us!
After that the Elder gathered his large robe around him, covered his face and lay down on his right side. Then, just as the Master was to do at his Maha Parinibbana, he entered into the nine successive attainments of meditation, in forward and reverse order, and beginning again with the first absorption he led his meditation up to the fourth absorption. And at the moment after he had entered it, just as the crest of the rising sun appeared over the horizon, he utterly passed away into the Nibbana-element which is without any remnant of clinging.
And it was the full-moon day of the month Kattika, which by the solar calendar is between October and November.
The brahman lady in her room thought: How is my son he does not say anything. She rose, and going into the Elders room she massaged his legs. Then, seeing that he had passed away, she fell at his feet, loudly lamenting; O my dear son! Before this, we did not know of your virtue. Because of that, we did not gain the good fortune to have seated in this house, and to feed, many a hundred bhikkhus! We did not gain the good fortune to have built many monasteries! And she lamented thus up to sunrise.
As soon as the sun was up, she sent for goldsmiths and had the treasure room opened and had the pots full of gold weighed on a large scale. Then she gave the gold to the goldsmiths with the order to prepare funeral ornaments. Columns and arches were erected, and in the center of the village the upasika had a pavilion of heart-wood built. In the middle of the pavilion a large, gabled structure was raised, surrounded by a parapet wall of golden arches and columns. Then they began the sacred ceremony, in which men and deities mingled.
After the great assembly of people had celebrated the sacred rites for a full week, they made a pyre with many kinds of fragrant woods. They placed the body of the Venerable Sariputta on the pyre and kindled the wood with bundles of Usira roots. Throughout the night of the cremation the concourse listened to sermons on the Dhamma. After that the flames of the pyre were extinguished by the Elder Anuruddha with scented water. The Elder Cunda gathered together the relics and placed them in a filter cloth.
Yasas initiation
Yasa was a man with great wealth inherited from his father. He had all riches around him, such as music and female company. That night he went to sleep listening to music and feeling the female company. He woke up early in the morning and saw the appalling scene of tired women sleeping here and there. Yasa was greatly frustrated.
The Buddha had a lengthy talk with the young man on generosity, morality, futility of sensual pleasures and the benefit of renunciation. Yasa could slowly collect his wits and his mind became stable. He had the rare privilege of being a monk straight away, when the Buddha called him as Come here, monk. He became a Sotapanna.
He was the sixth to be a monk as well as an Arhath. He is believed to have lived in Uttar Pradesh and Bihar in northern India.
The Buddha and his six arahants visited the home of Yasa the following day. Yasas mother and his former wife thus became the first two female lay disciples. Upon hearing of Yasas ordination, four of his closest friends, Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji and Gavampati followed him into the sangha and they too became arahants. Within two months, a further fifty of Yasas friends had joined the Sangha and attained arahantship, bringing the total number of arahants to sixty.
This Yasa should not be mistaken with the namesake monk who played a pivotal role in the second Buddhist Council, which took place 100 years following the Buddhas death.
How could Yasa get a chance to become the first Arahant monk after five ascetics Saddharmaratnavaliya has an interesting account:
Yasa had done a good deal of merits in a time of a certain Buddha. He and his friends were all born on earth in a time when no Buddha was in existence. Still they did merits such as cremating the poor and needy and those who had no kinsmen.
Yasas retinue
Yasas family found him to be missing. His father got into the street to locate him, but met only the Buddha. He was impressed by the sermon of the Buddha, and became a disciple; he attained Sotapanna too. The scriptures say Yasas father became the Buddhas first lay disciple. He was more than happy to hear of his sons spiritual achievement and invited the monk community to his home.
Yasas family members, mother and wife, became first female disciples and his closest friends, Vimala, Subahu, Punnaji and Gavampati became monks. This was followed by another batch of fifty friends, who all became Arhaths ultimately. Now the monk community consisted of sixty-one altogether. The Buddha knew it was the right time to propagate the teaching now.
Go forth, O monks, for the welfare of the many, for the happiness of the many, of compassion for the world, for the good, benefit and happiness of gods and men. Two must not take the same path. Teach the Dhamma which is excellent in the beginning, excellent in the middle and excellent in the end, both in spirit and letter. Proclaim the holy life, perfect and pure.

Lawyers call for SGM against BASL Presidents acts
A group of lawyers attached to the Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) yesterday, handed over a letter to the BASL calling the Secretary for a Special General Meeting of the Association.
This is to resolve in condemnation the act of BASL President U.R.de Silva PC for expressing his views on national media, without proper sanction from the Executive Committee. A letter bearing the signatures of 150 lawyers was handed over to the BASL Secretary condemning the acts of BASL President over the past few weeks.
We being members of the BASL are of the unanimous view that the decisions of the Executive President of the Republic in removal of the Prime Minister, prorogation and disseverment of Parliament is a matter of grave concern and of national importance relating to rule of law and administration of justice, which warrants consideration of the same by this Association, the lawyers stated.
The lawyers maintained that matters aforementioned are matters falling within the purview of objects of Article 2:1 (c ) and 2:1 (h) of the constitution of the Association.
They further said members of BASL over the past few weeks witnessed with astonishment and dismay the manner in which BASL President U.R. de Silva PC has conducted himself on public media, playing proactive role to justify the actions of the Executive President at whatever the cost.
They alleged that the BASL President has acted in violation of the provisions of Article 9:1 (e ) of the constitution of the Association.
He has further breached the provisions of Article 9:1 )b) of the Association by failing to follow the direction given by the Exercutive Committee in this regard.

MOODYS LATEST DOWNGRADE UNWARRANTED - CENTRAL BANK
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) yesterday said it is of the view that the decision by Moodys Investors Service on November 20, 2018 to downgrade the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) does not properly reflect the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals, and therefore unwarranted.
The CBSL wishes to reiterate that Sri Lankas macroeconomic position has neither deteriorated nor has there been any policy slippage since Moodys last rating decision in July 2018, in spite of the recent developments in the countrys political sphere, the Central Bank in a statement said.
The Central Bank further said that Sri Lankas current level of Gross Official Reserves (GOR) amounting to US dollars 7.2 billion is sufficient for the country to meet its external debt obligations in the period ahead.
In addition, as a precautionary measure, the CBSL has initiated negotiations with Central Banks of friendly nations with regard to obtaining foreign currency SWAP facilities of sizable amounts, the CBSL said.
The CBSL clarifying matters related to the agreement with the IMF said, based on satisfactory programme performance, the Sri Lankan authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached staff-level agreement following the fifth review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme on October 26, 2018, and the agreement was to be announced on 29 October 2018. The programme discussions are currently on hold, pending clarity on the political situation.
The Full Statement of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka:
The Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) is of the view that the decision by Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) on 20 November 2018 to downgrade the Government of Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings from B1 (Negative) to B2 (Stable) does not properly reflect the countrys macroeconomic fundamentals, and therefore unwarranted.
The CBSL wishes to reiterate that Sri Lankas macroeconomic position has neither deteriorated nor has there been any policy slippage since Moodys last rating decision in July 2018, in spite of the recent developments in the countrys political sphere. In fact, based on satisfactory programme performance, the Sri Lankan authorities and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) reached staff-level agreement following the fifth review of the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme on 26 October 2018, and the agreement was to be announced on 29 October 2018. The programme discussions are currently on hold, pending clarity on the political situation.
Sri Lankas current level of Gross Official Reserves (GOR) amounting to US dollars 7.2 billion is sufficient for the country to meet its external debt obligations in the period ahead. In addition, as a precautionary measure, the CBSL has initiated negotiations with central banks of friendly nations with regard to obtaining foreign currency SWAP facilities of sizable amounts. These measures will further strengthen the countrys foreign reserve adequacy, and would enable timely servicing of external obligations while intervening cautiously in the foreign exchange market to prevent a disorderly adjustment of the exchange rate. In addition, the fiscal and macro prudential measures that are already in place are expected to result in an improvement in the external trade balance as well, thus reducing pressure on external reserves and the exchange rate.
Arrangements have already been made to ensure Sri Lankas track record of meeting debt obligations on time is sustained. In order to meet the Governments external liabilities of International Sovereign Bond (ISB) maturities of US dollars 1 billion in January 2019 and US dollars 500 million in April 2019, the authorities have already built a buffer fund from proceeds of the divestment of Hambantota port and the syndicated loan of China Development Bank (CDB). The space provided under the Active Liability Management initiative not exceeding a limit of Rs. 310 billion also provides for building required buffers and spaces to meet future debt service payments. In addition, the issuance of Sri Lanka Development Bonds (SLDBs) of around US dollars 750 million to US dollars 1 billion during the remainder of the year and in early 2019 is now at an advanced stage of completion. These investments would be sourced through enhanced credit lines for state banks from the Middle East and East Asia, together with remittance and tourism related inflows. In addition, the US dollars 500 million enhancement, in February 2019, to the syndicated loan obtained from CDB is also on track. This means that by February 2019 more than USD 2 bn will be mobilized. This would more than cover all the ISB payments due in 2019. In addition the buffer can be further built up through USD 600 mn expected as disbursements from bilateral and multilateral agencies during next year.
Meanwhile, domestic financing conditions have shown considerable improvement through spaces created and debt management strategies introduced recently.
This has reduced the roll-over requirement of Treasury bonds and SLDBs in 2019, 2020 and in the medium-term. The Treasury bond maturities, which amounted to over Rs. 600 billion in 2018, are lower in 2019 and 2020, amounting to around Rs. 450 billion and Rs. 290 billion, respectively. Similarly, SLDB maturities, which amounted to around US dollars 2.3 billion in 2018, have also been reduced to around US dollars 0.62 billion and US dollars 0.82 billion in 2019 and 2020, respectively.
Further, the new acquisition of government securities by the banking sector has increased by only 1.5 per cent in 2018 as against the trend increase of around 5 per cent in recent years.
These developments along with resource availability among institutional investors highlight the substantial space that exists to meet financing requirements from the domestic market. Continued fiscal consolidation, particularly with the positive primary balance and the Active Liability Management initiatives, are expected to further strengthen the governments fiscal operations in 2019 and in the medium term.
Given these parameters, the CBSL is of the view that the recent rating action by Moodys is unwarranted.
Such an action only on the premise of heightened political uncertainty, with no evidence of slippages in macroeconomic policies, cannot be justified.

Mysticism and Buddhism
The Buddha was not an incarnation, a celestial being, a saviour, a demon but a teacher (Tatagata), a human being of extraordinary character. In Mahayana thought the Buddha is a cosmic being who from time to time manifests himself in human form. He was not an immortal being but a being with a penetrating genius. He was gifted with extraordinary perceptions and capabilities. The Buddha was not an ordinary man, but an extra-ordinary human being endowed with psychic as well as physical powers. He possessed the thirty two main bodily characteristics (Mahapurisa lakkana) and the eighty sub characteristics (asityanubyanajana), which identified him from the other human beings. All these were acquired and developed by him through a countless series of previous existences. He has perfected these for a period of four incalculable aeons of one hundred thousand existences.
The Buddha was competent in performing three types of miracles  express the marvel of magic power (iddhi prathihariua), the marvel fo mind reading (aLdesana pratihariya) and the marvle fo instructions (anusasana pratihariya). The Buddha condemned the first two because these played on people's credibility and could also be performed by non Buddhist ascetics. The third has been praised by the Buddha as noble and sublime because it was not a form of exhibitionism but a means of teaching the Dhamma. The Buddha has discouraged and even prohibited his disciples performing the first two magical powers. The ability to perform such miracles is said to derive from the attainment of super normal knowledge (abhijna) as a culmination of lengthy practice of meditation (sama:dhi). Not only the Buddham many of his disciples and non Buddhist ascetics were said to possess eight psychi powers (riddhi) namely: to project replicas of oneself, to become invisible, to pass through solid objects, to sink into solid ground, to walk on water, to fly, to touch the sun and moon with ones hand and to ascend to the world of the god Brahma.
It has been stated that Prince Siddharthe walked seven steps immediately after birth, raised his right index finger and utterd the paean of joy.
When he was just a child he has been seen practicing Anapanasati meditation and entered into the first trance.
The twin miracle (yamaka-patihariya) performed by the Buddha has been a spectacular miracle where he caused fire and water to issue from the opposite sides of his body. First flames emerged from the upper part and water from the lower part, then these reversed, and then they were emitted from opposite sides of his body. This was accompanied by the emission of differently coloured light rays from his skin pores. After performing this miracle the Buddha ascended in three strides to the heaven of the 33 gods and instructed his mother (who had been reborn there) the teachings of the Abidhamma. Seated on the Pandukambala stone seat of God Sakra, He preached the Abhidharmma for a continuous period of three months. The Buddha returned to this world every day to the Shore of Anotatta Lake in north India to take his meals and he gave Ven. Sariputta a summary f the Abhidhamma, that he had preached to the gods on the previous day. These miracles hae been described exquisitely in figurative metaphoric language in many texts and impressively portrayed in temple paintings. The Buddha's descent from the Tusita heaen has been depicted in the ancient paintings of the Trivanka Image House.
The Buddha was an eloquent exponent of the Dhamma. He was a great psychiatrist as well as a treat psychologist. He was a great story teller and a creator of verbal images. He could read the minds of the audience. He used the power of the word Anusasana pratiharya to tame a robber like Angulimala and a heavily drunk elephant called Nalagiri. The great writer Gurulugomi in his prose poem Amavatura has described how the Buddha tamed demons, elephants, brahamins, robbers, ascetics, mendicants and even divine beings and serpent kings.
There are many jataka tales which are reminiscent of the Buddha's supreme knowledge of recalling past events and foretelling the future within the cycle of birth and death (samsara). On the very first night of his enlightenment, during the first watch he developed retro-cognitive knowledge which enabled Him to read his past lives.

New home for courageous woman
Army personnel of the 57 Division collected funds and offered a new house to an iconic Sinhalese woman who lived in Kilinochchi, irrespective of numerous terrorist threats and untold hardships.
This was in coordination with the technical expertise, provided by 9 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the 571 Brigade.
The septuagenarian, Hemalatha of Deraniyagala, Kirihena with her husband has lived in Krishnapuram II village after she arrived in Krishnapuram II village in Kilinochchi in 1979.
Having left her four children with her parents elsewhere as LTTE terrorist threats were on the rise in the Kilinochchi region, they both put up a cadjan hut and continued to reside there. In 1996, after terrorists intensified fighting, she was forced to take refuge in a refugee camp and live there for nearly 4 years.
Afterwards, she began to sell vegetables in Kilinochchi town and later she developed good acquaintances with Tamil residents there.
However, she returned to her cadjan hut again with her husband in Krishnapuram after troops cleared Kilinochchi from LTTE terrorists in 2009 and was leading a hand to mouth life when their plight was brought to the notice of Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, General Officer Commanding (GOC) 57 Division.
After serious thoughts of the possibility of constructing a new house for them, all troops serving the 57 Division consented after they were enlightened on this proposed meritorious and humanitarian project.
Accordingly, engineering and technical expertise of 9 Vijayabahu Infantry Regiment (VIR) troops of the 571 Brigade undertook the construction part under the guidance of the GOC, 571 Brigade Commander and the Commanding Officer 9 VIR, Major Dananjaya Udapamunuwa on July 15, 2018.
On November 18, arrangements were in place to formally vest the house with Hemalatha and her husband who had undergone the bitter side of life for over 40 years. Major General Ravipriya, along with Colonel Najeewa Edirisinghe, 571 Brigade Commander and 9 VIR Commanding Officer, Officers and Other Ranks in a ceremony formally vested the new house with them.

Ill Poya reflections:
Practicing Dhamma, devoid of noise
What ones mind holds, at a given moment, is Dhamma. One has to begin to understand Dharma through realization. It is free from all sectarian dogmas, beliefs, rites and rituals. Even sectarian names are not needed. You may or may not call yourself a Sinhalese, Tamil or a Muslim, but you should be a Dharmic being, a person existing with a life of Dharma. This means that you should remain pure. If your mind remains uncontaminated, then all your other dealings, vocal or physical, will obviously become pure. On the other hand, if you learn the art of Dharma, you start understanding peace and concord within yourself
Dhamma is a very simple procedure, which is taking place everywhere and every moment in every being, which anybody can comprehend as soon as it is uncovered of the veil of mystery in which it was encircled by the attitude, thinking and way of life. Engels: (In Dialectics of Nature)
For example, Buddhism de-emphasizes individualism by highlighting anatta (no self) and anicca (impermanence) as two of the three symbols of existence. All beings are a mere combination of the ever-changing aggregates. Thus, a Buddhist cannot concede individuality because concepts like I, me, mine and you, yours are only illusions of such composites, which erroneously encourage us to consider that people are independent, static beings. We use these provisions only as a matter of convenience in as much as verbal communication does not have the capacity to describe a persistently changing being.
Ill and Katina
The Katina Cheevara is brought to their respective temples in processions and offered to the resident Upasampada monks, who observed Vas [rainy retreat] for nearly three months.
The offering of Katina Cheevaraya is considered as a highly meritorious act, which take place in most of the Temples during the month of Ill. Another among other significant thing that had happened on the Ill full moon Day is recorded in the Buddha scripts has been that a deputation of 60 Arhants were launched from Dhamma preaching to a huge crowd of people.
Oh! Bhikkhus for the Welfare of the many, for the Happiness of the many, through Compassion to the World, Go Ye Forth, and spread the Doctrine of Buddha Dhamma for the benefit of Devas and Human Beings. In this manner, the first Buddhist Missionaries commenced their journey on Il Poya day to various directions.
What ones mind holds, at a given moment, is Dhamma. One has to begin to understand Dharma through realization. It is free from all sectarian dogmas, beliefs, rites and rituals. Even sectarian names are not needed. You may or may not call yourself a Sinhalese, Tamil or a Muslim, but you should be a Dharmic being, a person existing with a life of Dharma. This means that you should remain pure.
If your mind remains uncontaminated, then all your other dealings, vocal or physical, will obviously become pure.
On the other hand, if you learn the art of Dharma, you start understanding peace and concord within yourself.
Keep your mind pure, full of love and concern; the tranquility and harmony that is generated within infuse the mood around you.
Anyone who gets in touch with you at that time establish experiencing peace and concord. You are doling out something good that you have.
This is Dharma, the art of living.
Practising Dhamma
We desire to discover for ourselves, with certainty, what is the purpose of life.
To do this we must be rid of all dogmas, religions, philosophies, creeds, races, nationalities and rites, because we cannot discover our purpose in life with all these hindrances.
So long as there are restrictions, there is grief and it is from sadness that all men would escape.
They are trying to find a way out of anguish, out of their entanglement in the wheel of sorrow and pain. In the attainment of excellence is Liberation to be found...grief and joy, pain and happiness, light and shade are the same thing.
True conception is the outcome of concord which is perfection, the fragile poise of reason and of life...Have no fear of life and you will have no fear of death.
The world is in an awful state where the men are caught in many a social and environmental influences which narrow their intellect and therefore limit their viewpoint and their contentment.
Surely, perception ought to take the place of our abstract thinking. The unconditioned mind can be associated with insightful mind. Life is not so very easy and the persons must have the strength and the ability not to be caught in the influence of unevenness. To find out for oneself what is right, all influence must end. There is no good conditioning or bad conditioning; there is only liberty from all conditioning. There are all kinds of things in life. Life is like the deep sea, which is tremendously deep, having vast currents and is teeming with all kinds of life. And self-determination from the very structure of thought is to be a light to one. To know yourself you need not read a book, go to a priest, to any psychologist.
The whole wealth is within yourself. In this light all action takes place. There are no how, no arrangement, and no practice. There is only the seeing which is the doing. One has to see, not through the eyes of a different person. As a mirror reflects all things held facing it, so when ones mind-mirror is quiet, one will be able to see a replicate in it the true quality of oneself and of other ones mind can discover what is true only when it is liberated from all conditioning, not when it merely repeat certain words or quotes the books called scriptures. Such a mind is not free. It is only the free mind that can be imaginative and it can be creative only when it is open, free from conditioning like the following of a pattern, a principle, or a tradition set up by an organised religion. It is only the free mind that can find out or perceive the truth of something. One has to discover it every instant of the day as one is living.
Sariputtha Thera
Among other significant events of Ill; Jatila monks Uruwela Kassapa, Nadie Kassapa and Gaya Kassapa who followed a different religion and living in Neranjala village, after listening to Buddhas preaching understood the dhamma. Saripuththa Thera told Buddha that he was weak and feeble and he would not be able to return after seeing his mother at his native place and he would attain Parinirwana there. Thus Saripuththa started his sojourn to see his mother. He lastly preached Dhamma to his mother, who realized dhamma.
Extreme poverty verses Hidden Psychic Disorder
Coming back to Katina ceremony; majority of the villages are living in extreme poverty; the funds collected for organising wasteful spectacular pageants could be used to worthier causes in improving the living standards of these dayakes.
The Nayake Theras should take serious note before they organise their next Katina ritual and prune down on generous spending. People spend millions to perform rituals and they expect in return mercy from Gods; there is competition to sponsor colourful shows at temples.
These festivals and other religious events are crossing limits when there are deprived poor people suffering without proper food, shelter, clothes and treatment. The motive remain behind such behaviour is to get a desired purpose and expectations. Psychologists attribute this sort of activity to hidden psychic disorders and nothing else.
Let us follow Melbourne example
A couple of years ago I happened to be at a Katina Pinkama in a Theravada temple at Dandenom, in Melbourne. The simple procession moved serenely with around 500 flag carrying Sri Lankan Buddhists joined by a few Australians, all shouting Sadhu, Sadhu. There were no hired drummers, dancers, horns, whip-crackers, fireball acrobats and lighting of crackers.
A few schoolchildren were riding their bicycles with flower decorations that added colour to the procession, while two of them cracked whips. The procession started around 10 am and reached the temple in half an hour, where they offered alms and the Katina cheewara. It is a pity, the following year back home; in wee hours of morning around 3.45 am a flow of unbearably loud sound of drums, horns, whip cracking and crackers put me up on my feet out on the road. I saw a Katina pageant- with few elephants, loud-speaker-mounted vans announcing the names of chief dayakes and the names of organisers; with another van chanting Pirith.
May all beings be happy!

Public officials bound to execute Govt. decisions - MP
Ratnapura District parliamentarian W.D.J. Seneviratne yesterday, said public officials are bound to execute decisions taken by the government of PM Mahinda Rajapaksa.
Seneviratne urged government servants not to be misled by media campaigns launched by UNP MP Akila Viraj Kariyawasam who said that public officials are bound to implement their decisions.
Addressing a press conference held at the Prime Ministers office, Seneviratne said the government will bring in a Vote on Account to cover government expenses.
He said that funds have been allocated for government expenses through the Budget till January and the Finance Minister can allocate funds for Ministries through the Consolidated Fund.
The President appointed former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister under powers vested with him by the Constitution.
This appointment was made in compliance with the Constitution, he added.
Seneviratne said that President Maithripala Sirisena appointed the former President as Prime Minister after taking the peoples opinion into account.
The economy had collapsed.
The countrys assets were being sold for a song and the country was facing serious danger in terms of security.
This situation needed to be arrested, the MP said.
He said that the UNP did not seek court orders against the appointment of the former President as Prime Minister and the Speaker also recognized Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister.
The Speaker had also provided facilities needed for the new Prime Minister in Parliament.

The Speaker had also provided facilities needed for the new Prime Minister in Parliament.
In the meantime, Parliament was dissolved and the UNP filed petitions seeking a Supreme Court order annulling the Gazzette notification through which parliament was dissolved.
He said that the Speaker changed his stance after the Supreme Court issued an interim order suspending the Gazzette Notification until the final determination on the petition is delivered by the court on December 7.
The Speaker earned the respect of all parties in the House and we had trust in him and we thought that he would discharge his duties impartially and independently. His conduct in the Chamber on November 14 cannot be accepted, Seneviratne added.
He said that Speaker could have discharged his duties with responsibility . His conduct in the chamber led to the disputes and clashes among the parliamentarians.
We stressed the importance of respecting Standing Orders. How does he remove a Prime Minister of the country by taking a voice vote  he queried.
He expressed concern and questioned the ingenuity and proficiency of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya for taking a motion of no confidence against a Prime Minister of an incumbent government in post- haste.
Seneviratne said no one can predict the Courts final determination on the Gazzette notification issued by the President dissolving parliament.
The UNP has no option other than sit in the Opposition, if court upholds that the dissolution is legal and constitutional,he said.
The UNP wants to drive the country towards anarchy but their dreams will never come true, he said.

The to realize the truth urgently
The Buddha was self-enlightened. Although he went to certain teachers searching for the perfect truth, no one of them could show him the way to the ultimate truth. Therefore, he decided to rely on his soon effort with a determination to find out the truth.
An ascetic was so impressed by the radiant appearance of the Buddha. He asked him who his teacher was. At that time, Buddha replied thus, All have I overcome, all so I know from all am I detached. All have I renounced wholly absorbed am I in the destruction of craving. Having comprehended all by myself, whom shall I call my teachers
Like a flower in full bloom which cannot keep the scent to itself, the Gautama Buddha, the fully Awakened One began to spread the sublime message soon after attaining the Enlightenment. He was merciful and generous completely to preach his teachings and share the supreme knowledge he had gained with the suffering of humanity. He was an incomparable teacher.
Certain people are extremely proud of their intellectual attainment. They claim to have knowledge but their knowledge is rarely coupled with wisdom. One western scholar admitted that the more we learn about things existing in the world, the more we create our own concepts and fantasies which are the product of our limited way of thinking and shaped by our limited senses. He said that instead of gaining wisdom, we have increased our ignorance. The people who claim to know many things only develop their egoism and sceptical views which create more confusion and disturb the peace and confidence in their own minds. The knowledge and attitudes they maintain often generate more misunderstanding and conflict instead of establishing harmony and goodwill.
During the Buddha's time, there was a young monk who had come from a wealthy royal family. Young and robust, he had had the opportunity of enjoying a wide variety of sense pleasures before his ordination. He was rich and he had a lot of friends and relatives. His wealth made available to him the full panoply of indulgences. Even then, he gave up all these on the point of seeking liberation. One day when the king of that country was riding through the forest, he came across this young monk. The king said, Venerable Sir you are handsome and robust you are in the prime of youth. You come from a wealthy family and have a lot of chances to enjoy yourself. Why did you leave your home and family to wear robes and live in loneliness Don't you feel lonely Aren't you bored
The monk then answered thus, O great king, when I was listening to the Buddha's discourses that leads to arousing spiritual urgency, a great sense of urgency seized me. I want to extract the optimum utility from this body of mien in time before I die. That is why I gave up the worldly life willingly realizing the danger of being late to spiritual progress and hence, I took these robes.
The above story points out to us the need of practising the teachings of the Buddha without any undue delay for our own safety in the next life of ours.
If you are still not convinced of the need to practise with great urgency, without blind attachment to this physical body or life, the Buddha's words may also be helpful for you to ponder over with much enthusiasm. One should reflect, he said, on the act that the whole world of beings is made up of nothing but mind and matter which have arisen but do not stay. Mind and matter do not remain still even for one single moment, they are in constant flux. When we are very young, we like to grow but when we are old, we are stuck in an irreversible process of decline.
May we all have the wisdom comprehended the four noble truths, as preached by the Buddha in this very life.

Refreshing generosity
The 25th Scholarship Award Ceremony sponsored by the Foundation was held at the BMICH recently. The Silver Jubilee Scholarship Awarding Ceremony of the Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation was graced by a delegation from the Agonshu Temple headed by Most Ven Fukada Seia Thera.
The Agonshu sect was founded in 1978 by Most Venerable Seiyu Kiriyama Thera. Born on January 5, 1921, the Thera was in a difficult phase of life due to illness. Although he decided to join armed forces during the World War II, his health condition did not let him fulfill that aspiration. The doctors predicted that he cannot live more than 25 years. The Thera, still a layman then, was largely affected by this medical prediction. He was on the verge of committing suicide.
After becoming a Mahayana monk, Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera was engaged in extensive research on the Buddhas teachings.
He travelled to a number of countries to pass on the Buddhas teachings. He combined the traditions of Theravada, Mahayana and Tibet Buddhism and founded the Agonshu sect. Within a short span of time, the Agonshu sect became an instrumental tradition of Buddhist teachings across the globe. Most Ven Seiyu Kiriyama Thera became an iconic figure among the Buddhists who took up Agonshu tradition.
The scholarship programme has produced doctors, engineers, university lecturers and other scholars. The scholarship, which includes three uniforms, shoes and socks, and exercise books in addition to Malalasekara English Sinhala Dictionary, feeds its holder till they pass A-Ls. Medical College students will get a coupon.
Every province, except for North, has been benefited by the scholarship programme. The programme is coordinated by Sri Lanka Agonshu Friendship Foundation under the supervision of its Director General Somasiri Addarapthirana.

The Provincial Agriculture Department of the Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council is promoting traditional foods in the Kegalle and Ratnapura districts, with the aim of building a healthy nation.
Under the project Suwa Diviyata Hela Aahara, housewives are being made aware about the nutritional value of local foods.
The first workshop under the project was conducted recently at the Ratnapura Provincial Council auditorium by veteran chef Dr. Publis Silva, and was attended by around 1,000 housewives.
According to experts in the health and food and nutrition sectors, the present-day food habits of people have become the major cause of non-communicable diseases such as diabetics, cholesterol, high and low blood pleasure, kidney diseases and more.
Therefore, it is important to return to the culture of consuming traditional healthy foods, so as to a measure to minimise the effects caused by present-day food habits.
The Sabaragamuwa Provincial Council believes that we are duty bound to make people aware of the local food culture as a measure to keep people healthy, Sabaragamuwa Governor Niluka Ekanayake said.
Provincial Chief Secretary Herath P. Kularatne, Agriculture Secretary Sunil Premachandra, Education Secretary Mahinda S. Weerasuriya and other officials attended the event.

The Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre took measures to control the spread of the invasive Fall Armyworm in the Ampara district.
The officials from the Agricultural Extension Centre conducted an awareness programme for farmers and warned them to be vigilant of the presence of the Fall Armyworm. Hand bills on crop protection against the Fall Armyworm, were also distributed among the participants.
Under this project, an awareness programme organised by Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre Agricultural Instructor and Officer In-Charge A. H. A. Mubarak, was held at the Market Square in Addalaichenai recently.
The Fall Army worm caterpillar has migrated from foreign countries. It destroys hundreds of acres of cultivation overnight and could affect over 100 species of crops including paddy, maize, sugarcane, green gram, vegetables and fruits, sources said.
The Agriculture Ministry and the Agriculture Department are jointly implementing this scheme. Addalaichenai Agricultural Extension Centre Agricultural Instructor and Officer In-Charge A. H. A.

Colombo Municipal Council (CMC), UPFA member Pradip Jayewardene urged the government to study the report of the second mandate of the Paranagama Commission which was asked to look into the final phase of the war in 2009.
Regardless of the political situation in the country, we will have to answer to the United Nations Human Rights Council in March 2019 and we need to be prepared, he told the Daily News.
The Paranagama Commission appointed in 2013 by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and officially known as the Presidential Commission of Inquiry Into Complaints of Abductions and Dissappearances submitted its report on its second mandate in 2015 and the report was tabled in Parliament in October 2015.
Jayawardene, the grandson of former President J. R. Jayewardene, explained that the Paranagama Commission second report which was handed over to the Presidents Office contained valuable inputs from famed international Human Rights lawyers which could help the country face the UNHRC in Geneva.
As a person who helped with it, I know that it can greatly help us deal with the human rights allegations. I am not sure whether the President read it as it was handed over to the Presidents Secretary when he was not in the country.
Jayawardene added that when the report was first handed over, former Minister Mangala Samaraweera had discredited it and swept it under the carpet, This is an extremely valuable report for us to face Geneva, he said.

What a tantalizing RWC Japan 2019 promises to be
Even the social media experts pundits would nod them for heads.
Speculation rife about possible contenders .... NZ. IRE, ENG, AUS, SA, FRA. ...Your guess is as good as mine
Locally its the Dialog Clifford Club League Cup up for grabs.
Kandy still command respect around the island as a fully professional setup with plenty of bragging rights over the last decade.
Consistency has been their exceptional brand value, the winning habit hard pills for their opposition to swallow...and that lurking feeling....what do we do to beat Kandy in Kandy
The league steaming ahead splendidly with no big shocks so far.
Kandy, CR. Havies...remain unbeaten... essentially down to fab goal kickers dominating headlines.
CH Maduwantha, CR Ratwatte, Navy Thilina, Havies Riza.
CH skipper Yoshita leading from the front needs his squad to bottle down for the entire 80mins.
Losing both games crucially to CR and Havies in the last 5mins of normal time...harsh reality indeed and hard to accept.
Demands of the league on players, management, coaching staff, backroom skeletons, medical and family all center around prehab and rehab......in other words its a player environment and player wellness is the number one priority.
Each weekend is about getting the 23 fit, mentally prepared and physically able....match fit squad to drill as a unit and go through the game plan for the weekend consistency is the key through all the weeks of the league.
Kandy will be pushed to the wire this season.....and under Richy Dharmapala you need to rely on the experience of the senior players like Vileweera, Ratwatte, Weeraratna, Anthony, Dhanushka Ranjan.......exceptional luxury to have the wealth of this skill to rely on under pressure.
Add this to the die-hard Nittawela faithful...and you have a formidable challenge in Kandy.
However I believe that CR, Havelocks,CH and Navy have good skills and firepower to challenge Kandy in the middle and test them on all fronts...which means the league is wide open and everything to play for ...every weekend lining up is a crunch weekend.
The bottom 4 clubs adding expat skill to their ranks making the competition more glam and sharper.
Especially for the spectators and defensive coaches as they try to break the run of play into chunks.
Sri Lanka Rugby need to consider opening their doors to expatriat players like in Japan, Hong Kong and Philippines which will enable Sri Lanka to be a regional rugby satellite for Asia.
Priority should be given to tournaments, rugby tourists, junior tours, senior tours etc......the potential is vast and the timing absolutely fabulous....
Speculation is rife about a rival shadow tournament Asia Pacific rugby extravaganza to mirror super rugby... funded by an extrovert billionaire ...with terrestrial TV already confirmed with just a matter of time before satellite television but partners get on board to make it a truly global platform for the game.
Keep in mind the timing couldn't be more perfect for Asia rugby with the Japanese rugby world cup due in 2019. Sri Lanka will be a fundamental part of the partnership and will benefit both players and spectators alike ....with all this in place the big pencils at Sri Lanka Rugby HQ need to be hawkeyed and well focused to meet the challenge this is how we progress and carve our pathway in the new rugby Asia.
Sri Lanka needs to stride across the waters and rugby needs to grow in leaps and bounds so that by 2020 Sri Lanka is a force in Asia...
Bula bula Sri!

Thawing the ice
Sri Lankas most controversial political stand-off since independence continues with the Executive and Legislature locked in a battle for supremacy, a tussle which also saw some of the ugliest scenes in our parliamentary history being enacted in the House last week.
The collective opposition comprising of the United National Party (UNP) and its allies in the United National Front (UNF), the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) claimed it had passed a vote of no-confidence with a voice vote when Parliament was reconvened last Wednesday. Thereafter, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya announced that the vote had been duly passed and that this would be conveyed to President Maithripala Sirisena.
President Sirisena then responded to the Speakers communication contending that proper procedures were not adopted during the vote of no-confidence. The President stated that procedures laid down in the Constitution, the standing orders of Parliament and parliamentary convention had not been followed.
The stage was set for more conflict when it was announced that Parliament would meet again the next day, Thursday. Newly appointed Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was provided with an opportunity to make a speech which he used to call for a general election. I am the Prime Minister. I have been the President as well. Premiership is not an issue for me. I have been coming to Parliament since my childhood. The Speaker allows only Mahinda Rajapaksa to make the speech, not as Prime Minister, Rajapaksa said, amidst cheers from the government benches and protests from the opposition.
After Rajapaksas speech, proceedings in Parliament descended into chaos. Scuffles broke out between groups of government and opposition parliamentarians. Objects, including a waste paper basked was thrown at Speaker Jayasuriya, several MPs suffered minor injuries and sittings had to be suspended. It was also alleged that UNP parliamentarian Palitha Thevarapperuma had brandished a knife.
Vote of no-confidence
Meanwhile, Jayasuriya also responded to the Presidents assertion that the vote of no-confidence was not duly adopted. I assure you that the 122 MPs who voted in favour of the no-faith motion against the Government and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, were all present in Parliament. Although I attempted thrice to carry out the voting in a proper manner, the tense situation prevailing in the Chamber prevented me from doing so, he said.
With parliament scheduled to meet again the next day, Friday, there were attempts to deescalate the situation. A meeting between leaders of the UNF and the TNA and President Sirisena was held on Thursday evening, hours after UNF leaders staged a protest rally at Lipton Circus in Colombo. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya also attended the discussions with the President.
At the discussion, President Sirisena requested UNF leaders to remove Clause 1 of the motion, which was submitted to Parliament on Wednesday, which alluded to the removal of former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, and to present it again on Friday. The President has requested all those present to conduct the vote by name call and to show their majority in the House in a proper manner. In response, both the UNF and the TNA re-iterated that they command the majority in the House and requested the President to accept this position.
It was against such a backdrop that Parliament resumed sittings on Friday. However, sittings were disrupted at the outset when a group of government MPs gathered near the Speakers seat. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had to enter the Chamber from a side entrance, surrounded by a group of policemen. As government MPs chanted slogans against the Speaker, many objects were flung around.
It has been alleged that Minister Johnston Fernando flung a chair in the direction of the Speaker. Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranaweera is alleged to have thrown water mixed with chilli powder which affected senior UNPer Jayawickrema Perera and JVP parliamentarian Vijitha Herath.
In the ensuing unrest, Speaker Jayasuriya again conducted a voice vote, passing an amended vote of no-confidence against the government, changed according to the instructions given by the President. However, this was again rejected by the President on the grounds that due procedure had not been followed. The President also said in a statement that he would not prorogue Parliament under any circumstances.
Perturbed by the events in Parliament, Speaker Jayasuriya declared that he would not be intimidated by any threats or obstacles placed in his way and would safeguard democracy even by sacrificing his life. Meanwhile, in an attempt to defuse the situation, President Sirisena called an all-party conference on Sunday. However, both the JVP and Speaker Jayasuriya declined to attend.
Among those who attended the meeting were Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, UNP Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, Sajith Premadasa, Lakshman Kiriella, party leaders Mano Ganeshan, Palani Digambaram, Wimal Weerawansa, Rauff Hakeem, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Douglas Devananda, R. Sampanthan and parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran.
The meeting ended inconclusively. The opposition delegation insisted that their second no confidence motion was against the incumbent government was valid. As it had been passed there was no longer a government headed by Prime Minister Rajapaksa, they argued. Rajapaksa responded, stating that he was ready to step down from the post of Prime Minister anytime if the UNP could pass a no-confidence motion against him and his government in a proper manner.
Rajapaksa pointed out that some MPs who had signed a no-faith motion against former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had withdrawn their signatures at the eleventh hour, when the motion was put to debate in parliament. A document containing signatures alone could therefore not be accepted as proof that a particular party had a majority in Parliament, he argued.
Electronic voting system
President Sirisena informed all party leaders that if he was to consider accepting the no confidence motion against the government, it should be adopted with the help of the electronic voting system or through a vote taken by name, indicating that a voice vote would not be sufficient.
With these discussions ending without agreement, there were concerns that proceedings in Parliament would again be disrupted on Monday. However, Mondays session was brief, lasting only about five minutes and were chaired by Deputy Speaker Ananda Kumarasiri. The Deputy Speaker announced that a selection committee would be formed to appoint MPs to parliamentary committees.
However, the tussle for parliamentary supremacy continues, both within and outside the halls of Parliament. Former parliamentarian Sarath Weerasekara has submitted a fundamental rights petition to the Supreme Court contending that the Secretary General of Parliament has no power to convene Parliament when a stay order against its dissolution was in place.
In Parliament, the collective opposition has submitted a motion that seeks to cut off funds to the Prime Ministers office. This motion is set to be debated on November 29. Parliament is due to meet again tomorrow. The opposition has also called for those who damaged public property in Parliament to be penalised while Speaker Jayasuriya has called for a report on the recent incidents in the legislature.
Meanwhile, in the greater tussle between the UNF and United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA), there is a lull and a stalemate for now. For all practical purposes, the UPFA has taken over the government with the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister and the swearing in of a new Cabinet, although the UNF maintains this is unconstitutional.
It is noteworthy that the Supreme Court decision regarding the dissolution of Parliament, due on December 7, addresses only that issue. If the dissolution is upheld, it can end the current conflict but if the dissolution is deemed unconstitutional, the current state of play will continue. An interesting and intriguing month lies ahead in Sri Lankan politics.

The Year on Year inflation based on NCPI has declined to 0.1% from 0.9% in September 2018.
Director General of Census and Statistics, issuing the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI), for the month of October said contributions to the inflation in October 2018 from food group and non-food group are -3.04% and 3.10% respectively. Contributions of these two groups to the inflation in October 2017 were 6.4% and 2.4%, resulting in headline inflation of 8.8%.
When compared to month on month changes, NCPI in October 2018 has increased to 124.9 from 124.4 reported in September 2018. This shows an increase of 0.5 index points that is 0.4 percentage points in October 2018 as compared to September 2018. This month on month change was contributed by decreases of expenditure value of food items by 0.03% and increases of non-food items by 0.42% respectively, the Department of Census and Statistics stated.
The decreases in expenditure value of food items were reported for fresh fish, eggs, coconuts, papaw, potatoes, dried fish, chicken, big onion, coconut oil and wheat flour. However, increases in expenditure value in index were reported for limes, vegetables, rice, sugar, banana, bread (normal), cinnamon, pineapple, green chilies, tamarind, Jak and Jak seeds and garlic.
The increases in expenditure value of non food items in October 2018 compared to the previous month was due to the expenditure value increases in groups of Transport, Miscellaneous Goods and Services, Alcoholic beverages, Tobacco and Narcotics, Housing, Water, Electricity, Gas and Other Fuels, Restaurants and Hotels and Clothing and Footwear.
Further, the group of Furnishings, Household equipment and Routing household maintenance recorded very slight expenditure value increase compared to the previous month. Meanwhile, the expenditure value of Health, Communication, Recreation and Culture and Education groups remained unchanged during the month, the Department of Census and Statistics stated.
