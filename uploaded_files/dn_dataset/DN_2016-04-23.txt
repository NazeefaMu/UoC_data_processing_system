Fighting for peace in South Sudan
JUBA, South Sudan - The giants dance barefoot in circles, strips of leopard print skirt flapping, before one lunges in to topple his opponent and thump him down on the grass.
There is a wild roar of support from hundreds of supporters crammed into the national football stadium in South Sudans capital Juba to cheer on a Wrestling for Peace competition.
In this war-wracked country, with a repeatedly broken peace deal now stalled after the rebel chief failed to return to the capital this week to forge a so-called unity government, the people are getting on with their lives as best they can.
Enough of war, we are tired, said policeman Peter Thony, who had joined the crowd watching the week-long tournament, peering through the wire fence around the pitch. It is good to just enjoy sport.
South Sudan has suffered more than two years of civil war, with tens of thousands of people killed and more than two million driven from their homes. But if there is one thing that can bring people together, it is wrestling.
It has taken too long to return to peace, so this is a way of saying normal people want normality, said tournament organiser Peter Biar Ajak, who hopes the games will bring a divided people together.
Competitors from different South Sudanese tribes are taking part in games backed by the US government aid agency, USAID.
Ostrich feathers and cattle dung
Wrestling is a sport that everyone loves, so coming here is hoped to encourage peace, forgiveness and reconciliation, Ajak said.
Back on the pitch, the winner leaps high into the air, an ostrich feather fluttering from his head and his torso daubed with cattle dung ash for decoration, as women wave umbrellas and ululate their approval.
The loser is led away by his teammates as the next bout is readied.
Wrestling is a popular sport among South Sudans dozens of ethnic groups, and has long been a way for young men to test their strength without resorting to bloody violence.
Wrestling for peace, forgiveness and reconciliation, read the slogan on a T-shirt handed out at the tournament and worn by one spectator.
Next to him stands a supporter of rebel chief Riek Machar, wearing a T-shirt with the face of the man many hoped would return this week to take up the post of vice-president, the job he was sacked from in 2013, months before war broke out.
Wrestling is not going to stop the war, said Philip Jok, towering nearly seven feet (210 centimetres) tall, with the traditional deep scars cut into his forehead that mark him as being from the Dinka tribe from the eastern town of Bor.
But getting together like this, well, we can see we dont have to fight each other.
Ajak, aged 32, fled the more than two decades war between north and south Sudan from 1983-2005 as a child, ending up as a refugee in the United States, studying at Harvard, then returning to his homeland as an economist.
South Sudan won its independence from Sudan in 2011 but returned to war in December 2013 after violence triggered by political rivalry escalated into a conflict characterised by extreme brutality that has split the country along old ethnic fissures.
It is not the first time he has run wrestling competitions, but the last one in December 2013 was interrupted by an outbreak of fighting between rival units inside the presidential guard, clashes that then spread across the city and into civil war.
There is hope
It was a terrible time, Ajak said, recalling the ethnic massacres that took place across the capital.
Fighting -- which still continues despite the peace deal -- also spread to the regional capital Bor.
The wrestlers from Bor were all here in Juba to take part, but their families were all back home, Ajak said, shaking his head at the memory.
The town was razed in the battles.
Now the tournament is being held again for the first time since the war began, a sign, Ajak says, that there is hope that things will get better again.
While there is no fighting in Juba, the economy is in ruins with soaring inflation and food prices reaching record highs, according to the UN Food and Agriculture Organisation (FAO).
Alarming reports of starvation, acute malnutrition and catastrophe levels of food insecurity have been reported in areas worst affected by the ongoing violence, the FAO said Wednesday.
Machars failure to return has left Ajak afraid that the games might once again by stopped by war.
People were upset. They thought it would all be cancelled, he said, adding that the top prizes of five cattle, including a bull and three pregnant cows, would be a major draw for competitors.
The war has to end and life goes on, he added. This is a way of saying we want peace.

## Title: HERATH the quiet EXECUTIONER

HERATH the quiet EXECUTIONER
There comes a time in a sportsmans career where he must come to terms with the amount of punishment his ageing body can take and having reflected back on that decide what is the best course of action for him if he is to sustain his career a bit longer.
Rangana Herath, the best left-arm spinner produced by Sri Lanka and arguably one of the best in the world has done just that. At 38 he has decided that playing Test cricket is the best way for him if he is to serve his country for a further period. Different cricketers chose different formats to sustain their careers some give up Test cricket and concentrate on the shorter formats  50 overs and 20-20 where there is less time spent on the field but the demands on the body is more and the pace is hectic.
Herath has found that his left-arm spin is best suited to the longer game of Test cricket where he has proved more useful to his country as a match-winner than in the other two formats. Incidentally he has the best figures in a Test by a left-arm bowler in history  9 for 127 against Pakistan in August 2014. It is not that he has not bowled brilliantly in the shorter format (how can one forget his sensational spell of 5 for 3 against New Zealand in 2014 when he single-handedly spun Sri Lanka to the semi-finals of the T20 World Cup which they went onto win) but his match-winning performances in Test cricket outweigh the other two and he has come to be identified as Sri Lankas main strike bowler in this format since the retirement of the legendary Muthiah Muralitharan in 2010.
Herath had said that he would take a call on his career at the end of the 2016 World T20 and it was no surprise that he has finally made this decision.
There are about ten Tests lined up for this year and Ive decided that I can manage myself and my knees playing in that format rather than the hustle and bustle of one-day cricket, Herath told the Daily News.
About four years ago Herath had the cartilages of both knees cleaned up when he underwent arthroscopic surgery.
It was fine for the first few years or so but with the extra work load of playing international cricket the pains to both knees started to come back especially when I am running, said Herath.
I have managed to continue playing by taping my knees. I was not 100 percent certain of being fit to play in all three formats, thats why I decided to stick to Test cricket, a pace which I can manage my legs, I am lucky that I didnt end up as a fast bowler because my career wouldnt have lasted this long, he said.
Herath made his Test debut at the age of 21 in 1999, but it was not until the retirement of Muralitharan that he found himself a permanent fixture in the national side.
When I was dropped from the Test side I never gave up hope. I knew I had the skill to play for the national team and kept on performing at domestic level, said Herath.
The national selectors thought that I was good enough and persisted with me for virtually all the matches played by the Sri Lanka A team. That gave me hope that one day I would be considered to play in the senior side.
The turning point of Heraths career came in 2009 in the home series against Pakistan when he received an SOS from Sri Lanka Cricket to join the team for the three-Test series when Muralitharan was ruled out with an injury.
Herath was then playing was playing in the Staffordshire League in England to maintain his bowling form as A tours were few and far between. Herath ended up taking 15 wickets at 26.93 from three Tests and helped Sri Lanka win the series 2-0. His Test career was revived and he has not looked back since.
Herath said that he has not taken a decision on how long he intends playing Test cricket, but at his age he said that he would review his career series by series and see how fit he is to continue.
I have not set any goals for myself. Whenever I have played for my country I have always wanted to see how best I could contribute to win. That has been my approach all the time. It would be a big achievement if I can get to 300 Test wickets but after that I dont see any goals that I can pursue, said Herath.
The spin wizard needs three wickets to achieve that milestone and it could come in the upcoming three-Test series in England. Only two Sri Lankan bowlers have reached that target so far Muralitharan (800 Test wickets) and Chaminda Vaas (355).
Although Herath played in 71 ODIs and 17 T20Is he never played in a World Cup final until 2014 when Sri Lanka beat India to lift the World T20 title in Bangladesh. On two other occasions he played in the semi-finals helping his team enter the final, but was agonizingly left out of the most important game. One instance was the 2011 Cricket World Cup in India when he took one for 31 off nine overs against New Zealand and the other the 2012 World T20 in Sri Lanka where he returned his second best figures of 3/25 against Pakistan. Both matches took place at the R Premadasa Stadium.
Herath believes that Sri Lanka has plenty of good spinners around like Dilruwan Perera, Tharindu Kaushal, Sachitra Senanayake and Jeffrey Vandersay but they need to be given a consistent run in the national team. That is how they will gain the confidence to bowl under pressure and under different conditions and situations and win matches for us.
You dont need one bowler to run through the entire opposition. We still have quality fast bowlers and spinners who can take 20 wickets to win a Test match, was how Herath surmised the national team in its current context.
Herath has not thought of what he would do once he hangs up his boots for the final time.
I am still employed with Seylan Bank and have some years to serve with them, said Herath who is presently their business promotions manager.
I am lucky to have an employer like Seylan Bank who has never questioned my position even on occasions when I had not been part of the national team. I will certainly want to share my experience and help young spinners and contribute in whichever way I can.

Gayle raises eyebrows with Blush baby name
NEW DELHI : West Indian batsman Chris Gayle has raised eyebrows by saying he named his baby daughter Blush, a nod to an infamous sexism scandal which engulfed him in January.
The self-proclaimed Universe Boss left many people wondering whether the name was genuine after his partner Natasha Berridge gave birth this week.
Gayle was pilloried over his remark, Don't blush, baby when he asked an irate Australian TV presenter for a date live on air during the Big Bash League.
The 36-year-old was fined $10,000 by his club Melbourne Renegades and later made an apology of sorts, describing his comments as a simple joke.
But on Thursday he posted on Instagram: We would like to welcome the arrival of our beautiful daughter Blush to this world 2 hours ago. He later said on Twitter: Thank you all for the sweet and kind messages. Blush won't Blush, my baby.
The destructive left-handed batsman received a number of congratulatory messages from fans and the cricketing fraternity. AFP

Pathana too good for Peterites- win 36-21
Isipathana College dished out a superb brand of running rugby to outwit and beat St. Peters College by 36 points (6 tries, 3 conversions) to 21 (3 tries, 2 penalties) in their Singer inter-school A Division league rugby tournament match played at Havelock Park yesterday. The winners led 17-5 at half time.
The match got off to a rousing start with both teams battling it out for supremacy. St. Peters shocked everyone present at the ground when they drew first blood in the third minute of the game, when off a scrum their vice-captain cum centre Avishka Heenpalla broke through the blind side and sent a beautiful off load to Biyanwila who dummied his way over to touch down near the left corner flag. Fly half Steven Sivaraj missed the conversion and Peters went into a 5-nil lead.
Within four minutes Isipathana hit back to get the equaliser when off a turn over ball winger Padmasanka fed his flanker Weeratunga who formed the overlap and burst through down the right corner flank to touch down for a superb try. Hettiarachchi missed the conversion and the scores were deadlocked at 5 all.
In the 21st minute of the game Pathana centre three quarter Sumudu Rankothge collected a ball off a three quarter move and scampered through brushing aside six Peterite defenders to score a spectacular try far right.
Hettiarachchi once again missed the conversion and Isipathana went into a 10-5 lead.
Isipathana drew further ahead when in the 38th minute off a ruck their tireless prop forward Ekanayake crashed through the Peterite defence to go over for a well earned try. This time Hettiarachchi made no mistake with the conversion and Isipathana went into half time at 17-5.
Soon after resumption in the 48th minute, St Peters were awarded a 30-metre penalty and fly half Steven Sivaraj put over it to close the gap to 17-8 in favour of Isipathana.
In the 60th minute Peterites cut the deficit down further when off a penalty they took a quick tap and their hooker Ravin Yapa broke through the blind side off a rolling maul and touched down for a try near the right corner flag, Sivaraj missed the difficult conversion and the score read 17-13.
Soon after in the 67th minute Isipathana scored again, when off a scrum their scrum half set his three quarter line in motion where winger Padmasanka collected the ball and drew the Peterite full back and gave a fantastic off load to his number eight Wageesha Weerasinghe who made the overlap beautifully and touched down for a try midright. Hettiarachchi missed the conversion and Isipathana extended their lead to 22-13.
In the 70th minute St. Peters fly half Sivaraj put over a difficult 35-metre corner flag penalty to reduced the gap to 22-16, but within the space of five minutes off a scrum Pathana moved the ball wide through their three quarters where Rankothge sprinted through the Peterite defence to score a try which Hettiarachchi converted for isipathana to increase their tally to 29-16.
Isipathana virtually sealed the match in the 77th minute when their dynamic winger Padmasank who had a spectacular game both in attack and defence collected the ball and darted his way covering nearly 45 metres side stepping many Peterite defenders before sending his co-winger Chamod Fernando over for a sensational try. Hettiarachchi made the conversion once more and the score read 36-16 in Isipathanas favour.
In the dying stages of the game the Peterites scored a consolation try through their second row forward Perera who bulldozed his way over the line near the left corner flag. Sivaraj once again missed the difficult conversion and Pathana romped home easy winners.

Royal up against unpredictability
Royal will come under scrutiny when they take on one of the most unpredictable teams this season St. Josephs College in their A Division inter-school Singer League rugby championship match at the CR & FC grounds in Longden Place today at 4.30pm.
Royal probably met a real force in their match against arch rivals S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia last week and after leading 15-14 lost in the very last move of the day by a close 21-15 margin. The story could be the same today against the Joes who are holding back nothing this season as they almost threatened the pride of Wesley College in their last outing played two weeks ago when they went down fighting 19-12.
The Joes will have to watch out for Royals forwards and their famous rolling maul and match upto them really hard to prevent Royal from scoring. The two three quarter lines are evenly matched and a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
St.Josephs are coached by former Royal College rugby players Billal Yousuf (Head coach), Ashane Dissanayake (Asst. Coach-Forwards), Asanga Rodrigo (Asst. Coach-Three quarters) along with ex-Isipathana full back Reza Mubarak as their kicking coach.
Royal College team kicked off this year's season in a superb manner by thrashing D.S. Senanayake College 36-10 and edged out the formidable Wesley College 17-14 before going down to the Thomians.
The players to watch are their captain cum playmaker number eight Nikila Gunadheera, second row forward Harith Lokugamage, prop forward Ayesh Maduranga, scrum half Nikil de Silva, fly half and vice-captain Ashok Wijekumar, two speedy wingers Mahima Gamage and Shabith Feroze, hard running centres Nikhil George and Andrew de Silva, hooker Hamza Reeza, flankers Yohan Kanishka, Pasindu Amarasinghe together with experienced full back Ovin Askey.
This year the Royal College rugby team is once again coached by former Isipathana, Wesley, St. Peters and Sri Lanka Under 20 national head coach veteran Sanath Martis and assisted by ex-Royal, CH&FC, CR&FC, Police and Sri Lanka national rugby captain cum number eight Dushanth Lewke. Former Sri Lanka national full back T.A. de Silva will be their kicking coach.
UNBEATEN SIDES CLASH IN KANDY
Two unbeaten sides Trinity College Kandy will host S. Thomas College Mount Lavinia at Pallekelle starting at 4.30pm today. The Trinitians go as favourites to win this encounter but they will have to throw in everything if the Thomians are to be subdued.
The other game in Kandy is between St Anthonys and Dharmaraja at Bogambara.

Science rout Kingswood 53/5
Science College, Mount Lavinia, whipped Kingswood College by 53 points (5 goals, 3 tries, 1 penalty) to 5 (1 try) in a one sided Schools Under 19 Division one segment A rugby tournament match played at the Bogambara Stadium, Kandy yesterday. At half time Science College led 22  5.
The Kingswoodians especially their forwards put up a woeful display and could not effectively stop the Mount Lavinia school from their free scoring efforts. They made as many as nine substitutions in the second half and still they went on their scoring spree to tot up the half century mark.
Kingswood's problems were as a result of many of their key players leaving the school and there were no adequate replacements and it is likely that this situation may continue into next season as well.
Science College scored their tries through flanker Janith Lakehan (1), scrum half Ashan Madunhewa (1), Prop Vibudha Sahan (1) No. 8 Janidu Fernando (1), Winger Tharindu Maduranga (1), centre Nuwan Udage (1) flanker Udesh Madusanka (1) and prop Charith Janith (1). Stand off Vibuda Sahan goalled five of the tries and put over the penalty.
For Kingswood College stand off Lakkitha Ranaweera scored the try which went unconverted.

NZs Guptill signs for Lancashire
LONDON, Friday  Lancashire have signed big-hitting New Zealand batsman Martin Guptill for the beginning of their defence of the English domestic Twenty20 title, the county announced Friday.
Guptill is due to arrive at Old Trafford following the conclusion of his commitments with the Mumbai Indians in the Twenty20 Indian Premier League and is set to play for Lancashire in the first six games of their Twenty20 campaign.
The 29-year-old was the first New Zealand player to score a double century in a one-day international and is the holder of the highest score in a 50-over World Cup after hitting an unbeaten 237 in the Black Caps quarter-final victory over the West Indies last year.
Martin is a formidable batsman, particularly in white-ball cricket, and is currently ranked as the world's third best batsman in T20 cricket, said Lancashire coach Ashley Giles in a statement issued by the county.
He's got the ability to take games away from the opposition very quickly once he gets going and I'm sure our fans will really enjoy watching him play, the former England spinner explained.
Guptill, who has previously played county cricket in England for Derbyshire, added: I hope I can make a real impact and help with their pursuit for another trophy in white-ball cricket.

FIFA announces body to monitor Qatar 2022 labour conditions
DOHA, Qatar, Friday  Gianni Infantino announced on Friday that FIFA will establish a body to monitor working conditions for labourers at Qatar's 2022 World Cup stadiums and insisted the tournament would stay in the Gulf.
Speaking during his first visit to Doha as president of world football's governing body, Infantino said FIFA would act on criticisms it has done little to protect those building venues for its showcase tournament in six years time.
We will not just sit and wait, he told journalists at a press conference.
FIFA will step up its efforts in overseeing -- in particular the set-up by the (Qatar) Supreme Committee -- in order to ensure the protection of the workers rights in the construction of the FIFA World Cup sites.
He added that the proposal had been welcomed by the highest Qatari authorities.
The body would monitor systems in place to ensure decent working conditions, and would be independent, added Infantino.
Infantino added: FIFA is not the world welfare agency... our job is to govern football, but of course we are aware of our responsibilities.

He said they should leave their ministerial portfolios and join the Common Oppositions May Day rally in Kirulapone , if they truly love theSri Lanka Freedom Party and the peoples forces around it.
Speaking to the Daily News, Ranatunga added that these SLFP ministers should strive for the formation of a SLFP led government by appointing an SLFPer as the Prime Minister.
Some SLFP ministers in the government are shedding crocodile tears about the SLFP while enjoying all perks and privildges from the good governance government, he said.
He said that the government has deprived the rights and benefits enjoyed by the working for centuries in the country . This government has destroyed the public service and working masses have been stranded, he said.
Ranatunga said that the SLFP Ministers in the government should also take responsibility for misleading the people.
We are organizing a May Day rally in Kirulapone against suppression of working masses by the government and any person who is against the governments move can participate this May Day rally,he said.
