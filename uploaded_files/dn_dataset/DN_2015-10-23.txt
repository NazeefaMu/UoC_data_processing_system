At 70, UN sets 17 goals to be achieved in less than 17 years
UN: Just imagine that when you enter 71, you dare an adventure by declaring your resolve to achieve 17 new goals by the time you turn 85. You do not just proclaim this but also show an extraordinary determination by providing 169 quantifiable targets for these goals to prove that you mean business.
Further, you venture into great festivity by displaying those 17 goals by illuminating your own huge building on the banks of the Hudson River in New York. You do not stop at that. You invite all your high-level friends to demonstrate your strong will and garner their support to achieve these social and environmental goals. The global community is provoked to acclaim your resolve.
Sounds strange Not for the United Nations, which did exactly that last week on the occasion of its 70th anniversary. The 193-member United Nations General Assembly on September 25 formally adopted 17 bold new global goals as part of a transformative, universal and integrated visionary framework on 2030-Agenda for Sustainable Development.
This comes at the time when the world is grappling with earth-shaking terrorism, life-threatening climate change, sickening corporate corruption, unprecedented inequality and global slowdown of major economies. Aimed to end the poverty and hunger amidst such atmosphere is like an old man resolving to scale a Himalayan summit even when glaciers around are melting, treacherous winds are blowing across, visibility is extremely poor and, above all, the life-line resources are dwindling.
These bold Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are built on its earlier eight historic Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) and its 18 targets formulated way back in 2000 and slated for the finish line in 2015.
For the first time, since its inception, the UN had engaged head-on to link poverty-reduction and development imperatives as sine qua non of peace-making.
For the last three years, beginning with the Rio+20 meeting in 2012, the process of formulating the SDGs as the follow-up to MDGs spread across the continents and engaged a broad cross-section of civil society.
However, acerbity and cynicism were expressed in abundance by the elite media. Many, particularly from the developed countries, reported on the SDGs with extreme sarcasm and even decrying the whole exercise as one of the usual UN jamborees. Some even called them "Stupid Development Goals", others "Senseless, Dreamy and Garbled Goals".
The SDGs and their formulation process cannot be referred to the jury without looking at the report card of the MDGs and the hands-on and concrete experience that the global community gained over the last 15 years. It is largely true that awareness about MDGs never reached the poor and hungry for whom they were designed. They remained unknown to women and children for whose empowerment, mortality-reduction and health-improvement they were targeted.
However, by any standard, MDGs can be termed as mixed success across the globe. The report card in 2015 reveals that the number of people living in extreme poverty declined by more than half, from 1.9 billion in 1990 to 836 million in 2015; the number of out-of-primary school children fell by almost half, to 57 million in 2015, from 100 million in 2000 and gender parity in primary schools has been achieved in the majority of countries.
Over 6.2 million malaria deaths and 37 million tuberculosis deaths have been averted between 2000 and 2015; 147 countries have met the MDG drinking water target, 95 countries have met the sanitation target and 77 countries have met both. Economists and development specialists sneering at the UN attribute reaching the MDG targets mainly to the progress in emerging countries like China and India. UN watchers also criticize, rightly so, the whole process of formulating the MDGs, which, according to them, are by a few consultants of the world body. The MDGs did have their weaknesses; the SDGs have taken note of the lessons learned over 15 years and strengthened the resolve for the post-2015 agenda. The MDGs, though simple and straightforward, were not really mainstreamed in the national policy and budget documents per se, but their intents were.
The MDGs were not legally binding. They were meant only for the developing countries and relied on financial and technological assistance from developed countries. For nearly half of their duration, the developed countries buckled under their own economic and growth crisis. In this context, the positive outcomes of MDGs stand out even more distinctly.
The UN is a unique movement of multilateralism and is also a campaign for global peace and well-being of the people and the planet. The MDGs and SDGs are not just about poverty, hunger, disease, unmet schooling, gender inequality and environmental degradation as such. The SDGs represent the seminal movement that recognizes that global peace would be a mere dream without sustainable development, responsible business and social inclusion. They are, therefore an innate part of the historic, worldwide and unprecedented mobilization to address a set of important economic, environmental and social primacies. - AFP

Any attempt to hide Avant Garde fraud will be a serious crime - Tennakoon
Any attempt to hide the alleged Avant Garde fraud which masterminded all other alleged frauds under the carpet will be a serious crime tantamount to the betrayal of the country and nation, said Campaign for Free and Fair Elections and Human Rights Centre executive director Keerthi Tennakoon said.
He was addressing a press conference in Colombo on October 22.
Tennakoon said the Avant Garde fraud is considered the biggest fraud which occurred in the country during the last eight years.
The Avant Garde transaction contravened the Fire Arms Ordinance of the country, he said. "When there was ample evidence to probe this illegal arms deal concerning Avant Garde, one cannot be satisfied by merely investigating it under the Money Laundering Act only."
He said that even though licence had been issued to use only 87 firearms, more than 3,000 firearms had been exchanged taking cover under this licence.
How could such a big transaction relating to firearms not come under the Fire Arms Ordinance when even a common man is proscribed from using a trap gun under its provision, he asked.

[Appreciations]-24.10.2015
Dr. Gamini Wijesekera:
Politician worthy of emulation
One is able and more qualified to comment on a person only after associating him for a considerable length of time. Gamini Wijesekera was one such friend whom I associated very closely. This appreciation is to mark his 21st death anniversary.
I had the opportunity of meeting Gamini Wijesekera for the first time in 1976 at the residence of Dr. Wickrama Weerasooriya. I was accompanied by Harsha Abeygunawardana and Naveen Gunaratne. They were discussing politics and Gaminis views were very clear, interesting and thought provoking.
What Wickrama Weerasooriya told me when introducing Gamini to me was exactly at the then President J. R. Jayewardene's final election rally at Maharagama in support of Gamini. This is what Dr. Weerasooriya said: "When you step in to Gaminis house, you feel as if you are entering a university. His father, late Prof. O. H. de A. Wijesekera was a former Vice Chancellor of the University of Colombo and a scholar in Sanskrit and Oriental languages. His brother, Dr. Jagath Wijesekara, is a consultant neurologist who practiced in Sri Lanka and is currently in the UK. All family members are graduates.
Gamini Wijesekera was educated at Trinity College, Kandy and Ananda College, Colombo. While a student at the University of Peradeniya, he joined the Samajawadee Student's Union and was a working member. After passing out as a doctor, he joined the government medical service. He also served as Secretary of the Government Medical Officers Association.
Later, Gamini resigned from government service and started his private practice in Pannipitiya. He specialized in childrens health and his dispensary was open from morning till late in the night, which was always full of patients. He became a well accepted medical practitioner in Colombo, no sooner he started practicing.
Subsequently, he entered politics and became a member of the Working Committee of the United National Party (UNP). At one of the working committee meetings, Esmond Wickremesinghe, father of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had a sudden heart attack and fainted. Dr. Wijesekera who happened to be there immediately gave him first aid and brought him to life. At that moment, President Jayewardene got me to telephone Dr. Wallupille, the cardiologist and Wickremasinghe was taken to hospital.
Gamini, along with President Jayewardene, followed him to the hospital. Gamini was able to save Esmond Wickremasinghe's life. I have observed that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has been a close friend of Wijesekera family ever since.
Gamini was appointed as the secretary to the Ministry of Transport in 1980, and rendered a great service.
He also served as director of several government institutions and also did honourary service at the Moratuwa University Council and the University Grants Commission.
He was the first president of the Rotary Club of Maharagama and was the President of the Cancer Hospital Committee. Also, he was a member of the Sri Lankan Cricket Board and took a keen interest in developing the game, until his death. Whenever he met Gamini Dissanayake, who he associated closely, their primary topic of discussion was cricket.
Gamini was elected to the Western Provincial Council in 1993 and was appointed as General Secretary to the UNP. Finally, he became a Member of Parliament in 1994.
He was never engaged in violent, acrimonious and vituperative politics. He strove to introduce gentlemanly politics to Sri Lanka, especially at a time when violence enveloped the Sri Lankan political culture.
He was never critical of his political opponents. Dinesh Gunawardana who contested the Maharagama by-election once told me that his opponent Gamini was a real gentleman and when Dinesh won the election, Gamini congratulated him. This was not surprising, coming from someone who always treated everyone equally, with a smile on his face.
Gaminis wife, Daisy Wijesekera, is continuing the social work he began. Gaminis daughter has joined the government medical practice following in the footsteps of her father, while his son is engaged in business.
We are extremely unfortunate that during the best and most productive period of his life, Gamini was snatched away from us due to a bomb attack 21 years ago. We lost an exceptional politician. Gamini was killed along with his political leader, Gamini Dissanayake and many other political representatives of the UNP.
Gamini was a social worker, a medical practitioner, a great humanist and a politician worthy of emulation.
May he attain the bliss of Nirvana!

Alexi Malcolm:
Provided yeoman service for netball
It was on December 6, 2014, I got up early morning to hear Rio's voice all the way from Germany: Alexi Malcolm passed away last evening. Round up the W.P.N.A. members and do what you can for his funeral.
I sat there trying to come to terms with the fact that Malcolm is no more. To the Western Province Netball Association, he was a special person. He was there for all of us. That is why the news of his death came as a shock to all of us.
My thoughts went back to our 60th Anniversary Celebrations which was on October 18. We celebrated with an open Netball Tournament and an award ceremony to felicitate past players and officials. Malcolm was awarded the Special award for 60 years of dedication and commitment.
It was at St. Joseph's Sport Complex that hundreds of netball players both past and present gave him a standing ovation when the chief guest and the guest of honour walked up to Malcolm (at our request) with Kumar's voice vibrating and declaring him the Star of the evening. We watched as he struggled to get up and thank us.
My dream was to have someone appreciate what I have done for netball. Today my dream came true. I am the happiest man in the world today. We did not believe then that those words of his, would be his last words to the Western Province Netball family.
His life was netball. He was so committed and dedicated to the game and worked hand in hand with past presidents and officials of the Netball Federation such as Anula Udalagama, Seetha Wickramasinghe, Trixie Jayasuriya, Cynthia and Kusuma George and many others. They maintained the highest standards and never looked for personnel glory the way it is sadly happening today. They were a unique lot who brought out the best in every player, and Sri Lanka at that time could proudly boast of well-disciplined and talented players who put their country first.
Malcolm joined the W.P.N.A. as a young man as the President of the Stadium Sports Club. His club had talented girls. They along with the Colombo Netball Club and shamrocks were our first members and after 60 years they are still with us, thanks to people like Malcolm who led us on all the way.
In the earlier days when Netball was a popular game in Sri Lanka, we all looked forward to the tournaments that Malcolm organized in the Stadium Grounds in Bambalapitiya which belonged to his father, Donowon Andree. Played under flood lights, it was any netballer's dream. It drew so many clubs to it. The 1st Netball queen, I remember, was Pamela Thajudeen of Stadium Sports Club. He organized award ceremonies for netball players. These are a few things he did, to raise the standard of netball in the country. The stadium girls called him God father of netball! That in itself is a loving tribute for his dedicated service to netball in the country.
I am happy we never let him down. When Rio decided to leave the country with her husband, it was Malcolm who decided for me that we have a young set of members in the committee and train them as future leaders for the Western Province. So with a smart deputy, a very efficient committee and equally smart secretary with Malcolm's experience and dedication backing me all the way, I managed to go ahead and steer the W.P.N.A. to it's 60th anniversary last year.
When I walk down the memory lane of the Western Province Netball family, Malcolm is a very pleasant memory. We made him a life-member 15 years ago. When little Jackie Ramlan went upto garland him, he hugged her and cried. It is a beautiful memory. Even after he was confined to a wheelchair, he was there at every tournament, to cheer them and encourage them and especially bring sweets to young players. To them he was Malcolm uncle  Our Santa Claus. To everyone one of us, he was a special person who had our interest at heart at all times. The Priest who officiated at his funeral, began his sermon this way: Malcolm Andree got into a bus last Friday and the name board read Heavan and I am sure he is already there. And I am positive that Malcolm is trying to get around god to form a netball team there is Heaven!"
We were the first Netball Association in Sri Lanka and Malcolm, I am sure, where we join you one day, we may be able to form the 1st Association in God's beautiful Home. Good bye Malcolm. You will always be a part of the Western Province Netball family. We will remember you with gratitude, always.

L. A. Gunasekera:
Loving mother and silent social worker
I write this on L. A. Gunasekera's fifth death anniversary which falls on November 10 with much feeling. Feelings of happiness for the beautiful memories we have of her. Feelings of sadness that she is no more to share life's joys and sorrows. We miss her but we know that she is free from pain.
We remember her as a loving mother, friend and silent social worker, with love and gratitude.
She hailed from a distinguished family from Matara. She was a lady per excellence. It could be said that there was a place in her magnanimous heart for everyone she came contact with. She was also respected by one and all for her sympathy, affection and compassion. She was also one who walked among the cream of society, but never lost the common touch. She was of a unique calibre. We loved her in life and we shall not forget her in death. Her passing away came as an irreparable loss to all.
She was married to Dublin de Silva, a businessman of Matara and had10 children. Her eldest son Ivan de Silva was the Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Mahaweli Development in the previous government. I will be failing in my duty if I do not mention of Anura de Silva, her sister-in-law who looked after her as a Florence Nightingale during her long illness at her ancestral home at Kaburugamuwa in Matara.
May she attain the supreme bliss of Nirvana!
Five years ago
On this sad day
the one we loved was
called away.
God took her home
It was His will.
But in our hearts
She lives still.
Cecil R. Senanayake.
On your birthday Brother
Treasured memories of Rohan Abhayaratna:
Your birthday was a few days ago but there were no calls wishing you.
No more birthday candles, only memories of a brother laid to rest.
Memories of our childhood the happy times
The good and the bad.
We had our moments like all brothers and sisters do
But we were there for each other right throughout
The end.
I thought of you today but that is nothing new
I thought of you yesterday and will tomorrow too.
I think of you in silence
And make no outward show
For what it meant to lose you
Only those who love you know.
Remembering you and all the impossible things you did is easy
I do it everyday
It is the heartache of losing you
That will never go away.
That is why this special message is sent to heaven above
For the angels to take care of you
And wish you a happy birthday and all our love
Happy Birthday Malli.

Gamini Dissanayake, a political colossus
In my career in Parliament, spanning over thirty years, I have always remembered the late Gamini Dissanayake as one of the most pleasant, charming, charismatic and most importantly erudite leaders this country ever possessed during the last several decades.
Having been educated in Trinity in Kandy, he was one of the Parliamentarians I loved to listen when he made speeches in Parliament both in English and Sinhala. I must also mention there is a vacuum that cannot be filled when Parliament does not include the great men of the calibre of Gamini Dissanayake in our national legislature. It is unfortunate the LTTE eliminated leaders of the type of GD who could have contributed immensely to the economic growth and sustainable development of this country - for the benefit of the people whether they are Sinhalese, Tamils or Muslims.
As I could recall, when JRJ government was elected to power in 1977 with a massive majority of five sixth in Parliament, the then leader entrusted GD one of the most important ministries - Irrigation, Power and Highways, who was in his early thirties. I must sincerely mention that I was fascinated so much to GD as a young staffer in Parliament in early twenties for his simplicity, unassuming nature, oratorical skills, smiling face - which no doubt in speed elevated him to national political groundbreaker - a Statesman in the making.
Mahaweli development project
In fact, I have always been stressing that the Parliament should consist of educated, capable representatives similar to GD. They should possess the ability and the capacity to use the human resources available in plenty as the engine to achieve country's goals for sustainable economic growth and development.
GD was solely responsible to the accelerated Mahaweli development project. His contribution to achieve test status in cricket is again a huge achievement for GD because we became the 8th test playing nation so early thanks to GD. We are now in the frontline in international cricket purely due to the untiring efforts of GD.
If my memory serves me right GD got down cricket legend - Garfield Sobers, to coach Sri Lankan cricketers at the very initial stage. Mr. Sobers was recently here in Sri Lanka. I am happy we have achieved so much in Cricket owing to the untiring efforts of the late GD.
The new politicians and cricket administrators need to learn and follow the footsteps of the late GD. It was indeed a pleasure to see how he ran the Ministry and the Cricket administration. I also recall he got down Dr. Rudi Webster, a well known psychologist, for the purpose of motivating and enhancing the mental abilities of our cricketers.
Sri Lankans should be extremely happy because we have a good number of leaders who have contributed immensely in the field of irrigation from the time of our ancient kings. Former Prime Minister the late D. S. Senanayake constructed Senanayake Sumudra under the Gal Oya Development Scheme, which is one of the largest reservoirs built in early 1960s.
Presidential elections
It was, thereafter, GD who constructed major reservoirs such as Randenigala, Rantambe, Victoria and many other smaller tanks in order to irrigate the dry zone for the benefit of the farmers under the Mahaweli Development Scheme. My father who was a senior Staff Officer in the Gal Oya Development Board (GODB) spoke so well of the ambitious projects undertaken by GD for the development of the country particularly to irrigate the dry zone. His only grouse was that GD took steps to liquidate the GODB, which was renamed River Valleys Development Board (RVDB), after having entrusted all the good work done by RVDB to the newly established Mahaweli Development Board (MDB). Mahaweli Development Board now looks after all the work carried out by the then RVDB, which is therefore now non-existent.
GD was an Advocate by profession having passed the final examination in the Law College in 1960s. I have no doubt GD was a visionary leader and it was so unfortunate that he had been assassinated by the LTTE together with several others when GD contested Presidential elections in 1994.
Gamini no doubt followed his father, the late Andrew Dissanayake, a Deputy Minister subsequently, who was elected to Parliament from Nuwara Eliya under the leadership of the late S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956.
It was a pity while addressing a Presidential Election rally in Mutwal on October 24, 1994, one of our beloved leaders, the UNP Presidential nominee, was assassinated by a suicide bomber. I wish GD be reborn in Sri Lanka to serve the country even better.

Govt will enhance quality of Police service - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said the new government's aim is to provide required facilities sufficiently to enhance the quality of police service.
He added that the police has a vast responsibility in the process of building a better society to protect law and order in this country. "I trust the Police Department will be committed to fulfill that responsibility," he said.
The President made these remarks at the passing out ceremony of 406 Police Officer at the Sri Lanka Police College in Kalutara yesterday.
President Sirisena said the main responsibility of a government is to save the poor people of the country from poverty in the course of building a moral society.
"The aim of the new government is to save poor people from poverty and empower them economically. Contribution of every field including the police is required in this regard," the President said.
He expressed his gratitude to the commitment displayed by the Police Department during the time of war. He also thanked for the contribution of the police in implementing of state policies for good governance, by protecting law and order in the country at present.
Three Junior Assistant Police Superintendents, 186 of Junior Sub Police Inspectors, 15 of Junior Sub Police Inspectors for State Intelligence Service and 202 of Junior Police Constables passed out at this ceremony.
President Sirisena presented awards to those who demonstrated excellent skills.
Law and Order and Prisons Reform Minister Tilak Marapana, Ministers Rajitha Senaratne, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Deputy Minister Priyankara Jayarathne, Member of Parliament Rohitha Abeygunawardena, Secretary to the Ministry of Law and Order and Prisons Reform Jagath Wijeweera and Inspector General of Police N.

Hiker finds 1,200-year-old Viking sword
NORWAY: A sword is probably the last thing you'd expect to find on a hike -- especially one that's more than a millennium old.
But that's what happened to a man in Norway who recently stumbled across a 1,200 year-old Viking sword while walking an ancient route.
The find, which dates from approximately 750 AD and is in exceptionally good condition, was announced by Hordaland County Council.
County Conservator Per Morten Ekerhovd described the discovery as "quite extraordinary."
"It's quite unusual to find remnants from the Viking age that are so well preserved ... it might be used today if you sharpened the edge," he told CNN.
Outdoorsman Goran Olsen made the unusual find when he stopped for a rest in Haukeli, an area known for fishing and hunting about 150 miles (250 kms) west of capital, Oslo. The rusted weapon was lying under some rocks on a well-known path across a high mountain plateau, which runs between western and eastern Norway.
The mountains are covered with frost and snow for at least six months of the year and not exposed to humidity in summer, which contributed to the sword's exceptional condition, Ekerhovd said, adding that archaeological remains are often found along the paths. - CNN

Lankans consolidate after Prasad's heroics
An inspired spell of bowling from Dhammika Prasad brought Sri Lanka back into the game on day two of the second Test match against the touring West Indies team for the Sobers-Tissera Trophy continued at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo yesterday.
The dynamic opening bowler successfully spearheaded his team's attack with another four-wicket haul as the home side made amends for their batting failure by bundling out the opposition for 163 runs in the first innings.
Sri Lanka with a lead of 37 runs started their second innings disastrously while losing opener Dimuth Karunaratne in the very first ball.
However Kaushal Silva and debutant Kusal Mendis consolidated the position with a determined second wicket stand of 65 runs. Mendis looked confident stroking seven boundaries before he edged one to the wicket keeper.
The home side eventually reached 76 for two at stumps which gave them an overall lead of 113 with eight second innings wickets in hand.
Earlier Dhammika Prasad masterminded a superb Sri Lankan comeback by producing a hostile spell of bowling .
Prasad would have loved to have picked up his second five wicket haul in his career and he would have achieved that had wicket keeper Kusal Perera stretched more to his right to a snick from Kemar Roach.
But yet, this was a fantastic effort from Prasad who seem to be enjoying a great year having already made his presence felt during the recent home series against Pakistan and India respectively.
In fact he produced a similar effort against India with a much stronger batting line-up in the second innings in a Test match in August at this same venue.
Even then the pressure was always on Prasad who has now emerged as the country's main strike bowler having fully recovered from a series of injuries.
The good thing about Prasad is that he responded whenever his captain called in to bowl given the situation and also he enjoyed the role of performing his task in short spells.
In the morning he broke the heart of the West Indies batting line-up with a fiery spell which ensured that the visitors would struggle to reach a modest total throughout the day.
West Indies went into lunch at 77 for four and Prasad once again struck during the second session while having the key wicket of Jermaine Blackwood that further strangled the batting side. In between Sri Lanka had a couple of excellent supporting acts from Dilruwan Perera and Milinda Siriwardena who was able to claim a wicket in his very first over of the innings.
Quite stranglely Rangana Herath managed to claim only a solitary wicket but Dilruwan Perera probably performed that role to near perfection by polishing off the tail and claiming the last three wickets of the innings.
Opener Kraigg Brathwaite of course offered some kind of resistance while battling for 101 deliveries for his top score of 47 which included three boundaries.
In addition skipper Jason Holder also made a desperate attempt to bring some respectability to the West Indies total by smashing a 37 ball 21 with the help of one six and two boundaries.

Life's a beach in Italian Riviera town as 3 in 4 skip work
ITALY: It is a well-known holiday destination and employees of the Italian Riviera resort of San Remo have been caught slipping into vacation mode a little too frequently.
With the help of secret cameras, local police have discovered that nearly three out of four town hall employees regularly abandoned their work stations for more agreeable pursuits.
They included one who spent much of his work time indulging his passion for canoeing yet still regularly filed overtime claims.
The astonishing scale of absenteeism came to light after police were tipped off about the problem and organised a surveillance operation covering 272 of the town's 528 staff. They announced Thursday that 196 of those monitored, or 72 percent, were guilty of "frequent irregularities".
A total of 35 staff have been placed under house arrest pending trials while another 114 were found to have been guilty of illegal conduct but will not face further action. - AFP

Commission reports give strength to Sri Lanka
Major contradictions in "Rise with Geneva"
There is a predictable cyclical gathering of the anti-government groups within the UPFA with the approach of any elections in the country. This is now seen in efforts to raise a new political alliance of the minor constituent parties of the UPFA, with the approach of the next round of Local Government elections, and their hope of a section of the SLFP supporting them.
There is hardly any consensus on policy among these allies of discord, other than the hope of getting the twice defeated Mahinda Rajapaksa to lead them once again, in the desperation to avoid a humiliating defeat at local polls. The current indications are that with these polls being delayed due to finalizing of the delimitation process, the SLFP would be in a stronger position to do without its so-called allies in the UPFA, while the UNP retains its own strength and political image without any damage, similar to what the SLFP (within the UPFA) suffered on August 17. The current rise in the probes on corruption and fraud during the past regime, and the increased success seen in police action on major crimes during that period, especially political murders, indicate that the hopes these groups keep fanning of a Mahinda Rajapaksa leadership would be distant from reality.
"Rise with Geneva"
These political groups now moving to the fringes of isolation have no common policy other than that of necessary survival. The majority of them, with the lead given by Wimal Weerawansa's National Freed Front, Dinesh Gunawardena's Mahajana Eksath Peramuna and Udaya Gammanpila's Pivithuru Hela Urumaya have a clearly racist agenda. Their other allies on what is left of the left today, such as the remnants of the LSSP led by Tissa Vitharana, the remainder of the Communist Party led by DEW Gunasekara and the Democratic Left Front led by Vasudeva Nanayakkara, have abandoned whatever socialist or social democratic thinking they once had, and are only carrying on with the slogan of anti-US and Western imperialism.
In this situation, it is inevitable that these forces of defeat that pledged to "Rise with Mahinda" after January 8 and the run up to the August 17 General Election, now see an opportunity for a "Rise with Geneva". With Sri Lanka co-sponsorship the latest UNHRC resolution on this country, the message they will take to the people is that this co-sponsorship has placed Sri Lanka in great difficulty to ensure good independent investigations into any changes this country may have to face, with regard to events at the end of the war against the LTTE, and events that took place before and after that.
Earlier this week we saw the addition of a religious aspect to this campaign of desperation with the appeal made to religious leaders by GL Peiris, who had been more in the background after the two Rajapaksa defeats. His message was of the country being in such danger that there was an essential role for its religious leaders to play to save the country. The effort to whip up public feeling against the Geneva Resolution, and what will have to be done to implement it, is moving in a trajectory that attempts to show that the necessary legal and judicial actions could not be taken by Parliament alone, and that these would need constitutional amendments, which would require approval by a referendum. This is the angle that will be carried out with the intensity that could be gathered by these groups of desperation, in the coming weeks and months.
The Government must take note of these trends seeking to push the country back to a period of racial, religious and communal strife, and move away from the promise to the country and the world of peace, reconciliation, accountability and development. It will also require displaying agreement, especially among Cabinet Ministers on policies or actions taken by the government. The absence of this could only help support the divisive efforts of the UPFA groups in their struggle for survival. There is also the need for more caution regarding matters such as appointments to key positions in the administration and the state sector to prevent any impression of a rush back to the days of nepotism, even in a scope much more limited than the days of Rajapaksa.
Two Commission reports
To those seeking to "Rise with Geneva", a very good response has come from the reports of the two important commissions tabled in Parliament by the Prime Minister on Tuesday. The Paranagama Commission on Missing Persons and the older Udalagama Commission on allegations of major breach of the law by security forces personnel, show very good cause for the issues raised about Sri Lanka in the UNHRC report, and the need for proper action on accountability, as well as punishment where necessary, in keeping with the laws of our own land, apart from that of the impact of our policies on the world outside.
We are all glad that the Paranagama Commission has debunked the Darusman Report's findings of more than 40,000 civilians killed in the last stages of the war against the LTTE, and other aspects of that report not based on proper investigation. There is also the recognition that the majority of the Tamil civilian casualties in the final 12 hours of the conflict was caused by the LTTE.
Yet, those who seek to "Rise with Geneva" should also bear in mind that the Paranagama Commission, appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, which had the assistance of foreign personnel too, has not given a completely clean sheet to Sri Lanka. Among its key observations is: "There are credible allegations which, if proved to the required standard, may show that some members of the armed forces committed acts during the final phase of the war that amounted to war crimes giving rise to individual criminal responsibility". The commission has called for an independent judicial investigation into war crimes allegations, and also proposed to set up a separate war crimes division within the Sri Lankan legal system.
This is not very far from the call for a domestic mechanism, with foreign assistance, that Sri Lanka has supported by co-sponsoring the Geneva Resolution last month.
The Udalagama Commission on several alleged actions of violence by the police and armed services, which submitted its report on some of the matters submitted for inquiry, which related to matters after August 1, 2006, (and which report was never revealed by the previous Government), also makes very strong observations on matters of local and international, importance. Due to the confines of space, I will be brief on the observations of the Commission. On investigations into the killing of 17 aid workers, which caused concern both in Sri Lanka and abroad, it says that the manner in which the Police conducted the initial investigation into these killings in early August 2006 lacked professionalism.
The Commission also probed the deaths of 61 persons in Naddamottankulam (Senchoali) in August 2006, the alleged execution at Welikanda of 14 persons from Muttur, while being transported in ambulances, the killing of 10 Muslim villagers at Redalla and the killing of five youth in Trincomalee. Out of 16 cases it was able to conclude proceedings only in seven cases. It is the view of the Udalagama Commission that it is necessary to incorporate a comprehensive component of human rights and international humanitarian law in all police and armed forces training schemes.
Our capabilities
The complete reports of the Udalagama and Paranagama Commissions do show that Sri Lanka does have capable personnel, with necessary knowledge of law and its application, to probe into any allegations. But the refusal of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regime to release these reports did cause a very bad slur on the image of the country, which led to the understanding that had to be reached in Geneva this year.
This should remind those hoping for a "Rise with Geneva" to understand the consequences of refusing to work together with the international community, especially the United Nations, and also to cock-a-hoop to the views of those who can be critical of this country and its policies. These reports show the absence of any possibility to bring the Heroes of Battle to trial, as the Geneva Risers say, except those in the forces who may have violated the law, and therefore fail to be heroes.
In a strange sequence of events, the UPFA opponents of the Geneva Resolution are joined by Jayalalithaa and Vaiko, in Tamil Nadu, who oppose it on racist grounds, and call for an international investigation, and not the foreign assisted domestic mechanism that has been agreed on. It is certainly a political puzzle as to how the racist elements here who oppose Geneva as being pro-Tamil, can agree with the Tamil Nadu leaders who think it is not pro-Tamil, and how the former leftists can stand in the midst of the contradiction. Yet, such contradiction is obviously the way to "Rise with Geneva" today.

Mexico police find drug tunnel at US border
US: Mexican police have found an 800-metre (half-mile) long tunnel used by a gang to sneak drugs from Tijuana to the California city of San Diego, authorities said Thursday.
The federal officers detained 16 suspects and seized 10 tonnes of marijuana in Wednesday's operation in a warehouse, the National Security Commission said in a statement.
The 10-metre (33-foot) deep tunnel had tracks to transport the narcotics on a platform-like car, a ventilation system and lights.
After a weeks-long investigation, police moved in after seeing an "intense movement" of trucks going in and out of the warehouse, "apparently to leave drugs" bound for the United States, the statement said.
The police operation was conducted "without firing a single shot, surprising the suspected drug smugglers," it said.
Most of the suspects were between the ages of 21 and 50 and were from the northwestern state of Sinaloa.
They told investigators that they packed and shipped drugs and had links with a criminal group based in the western state of Jalisco, the statement said.
Drug cartels have been shipping drugs to the United States through sophisticated underground tunnels for years.- AFP

MR knew UNHRC would commence international inquiry on war crimes against Sri Lanka - Gayantha
Sandasen Marasinghe, Irangika Range and Disna Mudalige
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa called for a Presidential election two years before the completion of his term as he was very well aware of the adverse situation the country would have to face, as he did not fulfill the pledges he made to the international community, said Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilake. He made this observation in Parliament yesterday joining the adjournment motion moved by the government side on Thursday on the UNHRC resolution.
The minister said the former President knew that the UNHRC would have commenced an international inquiry on war crimes against Sri Lanka as he had not kept the promises he made to the international community.
"This trick had been used by leaders of many countries unsuccessfully to point out that they were popular in the country and what they were doing was the right thing," Karunathilake said. "But as Sri Lanka is not an unfortunate country, the people changed the regime and elected President Maithripala Sirisena, and then a new government."
The minister said good governance was then set up, 19th amendment was introduced an the background was created for national reconciliation.
He added these developments were commended in Geneva.
"It is a victory of the government that we could co-sponsor a favourable resolution to Sri Lanka which would provide an opportunity to inquire allegations within our judiciary system with the support of the international community," Minister Karunathilake said.
He said it was Mahinda Rajapaksa as an opposition member on October 25, 1990 who said in Parliament he would go before the UNHCR against the UNP government and urge to inquire into allegations of human rights violation.
"Following the example of the teacher, the Tamil Diaspora and the people in the North went before the UNHCR," the minister said.
"On the other hand a hybrid court is not a new concept.
International assistance was gained at inquiries into the Kobbekaduwa murder, Lalith Athulathmudali murder and SWRD Bandaranaike murder."
He added that due to this situation, there are no reasons for unfounded fear.
People spread racism for their survival - Anura
JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday that various people spread racism for their political survival in the past and the end result was that the country had to suffer from a 30-year long war.
We still do not know the number of people dead and the exact cost spent on the war. Finally, the innocent people had to pay the price, but not by those who spread racism.
Participating in the debate on the Geneva based UNHRC report, MP Dissanayake said it was compulsory to promote harmony among all communities if the country wished to move forward and to do so, we have to accept the fact that they too have equal rights. A solution to the ethnic problem may be impossible unless the fundamental needs of the people in the North and East are fulfilled.
TNA hoped that India would solves this problem. But it did not happen. They commenced a large number of projects in the North and East such as renovation of the Northern Railway track, but not a single job was given to the youth in those regions.
They have also exploited the fish of our innocent fishermen in the North and East. Not only India, but also many Western Nations, including the US had not genuinely helped us to solve our problems. This is only a part of their political agenda. Today Jaffna has turned into a den of India's "RAW" spy service. They attempt to create political instability in Jaffna. We should put a stop to it.
It is a right of every citizen to know what exactly happened during the post conflict period. If we do not expose them, the rulers would continue to repeat such mistakes. We wish to to know what really happened to those who had been abducted during the time of the war. Lalith and Kugan were abducted. We still do not known what had happened to them.
OHCHR Report:
Mangala failed to counter false allegations - Dinesh
The government by accepting the OHCHR report on Sri Lanka had also admitted the false charges it contained, UPFA MP Dinesh Gunawardena said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, Gunawardena said that Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera, had failed to counter the false allegations made in the report, adding that Samaraweera had no guts to speak against the report.
"When we were in the ruling party, our government always shielded the motherland from international pressure. This government fully surrendered to international pressure," he added.
Gunawardena further said the UNHRC Resolution violated the Constitution of the country, adding that it endangered the sovereignty of the country. He asked why the Government hesitated to table the Paranagama Commission report before the Geneva Resolution.
Joining in the debate, Transport Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Prince Zeid Al-Hussein, had been unaware of the contents of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, when he presented the report.
"We do not fully embrace the report of the Prince. However, if we are to prove the charges in it, we must hold an inquiry. Why are you afraid of a domestic inquiry The final resolution that came out was a watered down version.
The stand of the SLFP is that the probe should be carried out adhering to the Constitutional framework of the country. We would not approve anything beyond that limit," he commented.
Foreign embassies shedding crocodile tears for Tamil people - Devananda
Foreign embassies located in Colombo did not attend to the grievances of the Tamil people when the LTTE was in function, said Opposition member Douglas Devananda.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, joining the adjournment motion moved by the government on Thursday, which lasted for 2 days on the UNHCR Resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka.
The previous government took measures to provide food and medicine to the people in North and East despite LTTE atrocities," said MP Devananda. "We attempted to protect the Tamil people when the LTTE was functioning and even after it was eliminated."
Parliamentarian Devananda further said they even protested near foreign embassies in Colombo so that they would take measures to protect the Tamil people from the LTTE.
But they did not give ear to their grievances. He also said those foreign countries were now shedding crocodile tears for the Tamil people.

Wimal has two passports, says Ajith
Power and Energy Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera told Parliament yesterday, that an ordinary person usually has only one passport, but MP Wimal Weerawansa apparently possesses two passports.
He sees hybrid ghosts in everything, because his entire life is hybrid. He had another name when he was a journalist. Now his behaviour is hybrid, policy is hybrid. We know that he has many other hybrid things.
Participating in the Adjournment Debate on the Geneva based UNHRG report, he said information had been received that MP Wimal Weerawansa was gone to Italy to bolster an organisation that fuels communism. MP Dinesh Gunawardene said Wimal Weerawansa has been taken into custody by the CID, but we request he be allowed to go abroad as per assurance given by the Speaker.
UPFA MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said that he spoke with the Immigration and Emigration Controller and I believe the problem with the Visa, obtained on the new passport will be sorted.
He has been taken into custody while attending to this matter. Even the Immigration and Emigration Controller had not made any complaint in this regard.
Domestically designed war crimes inquiry by Sri Lankans for Sri Lankans - FM
The mechanism introduced by the UNHRC to inquire into war crimes would be completely domestically designed by Sri Lankans for the Sri Lankans, said Foreign Minister Mangala Samaraweera.
He stated that hypocritical opposition members failed to point out the fact that the final architect of this mechanism was Sri Lanka and the inquiry should be made under a Sri Lankan Judiciary system and Constitution of Sri Lanka.
He made this observation in Parliament yesterday, participating in the Adjournment Debate on the Geneva based UNHRC Report and alleged human rights violations during the last phase of the war.
"Future historians in Sri Lanka would decide whether the unanimous resolution on October 01, 2015 before the UNHRC is historic." said Minister Samaraweera. "Forty five countries, including Russia, China, India and Pakistan have expressed their support to this mechanism that would bring about a reconciliation whereas during the Rajapaksa regime, we were supported by only 12 countries, including Congo."
The Foreign Minister stated that this co-sponsored resolution had put a full-stop that Sri Lanka is being cornered by the international community. "This is not an achievement by me or my ministry, but it was due to the new political culture brought about by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on January 08.
"We could make the US sponsored resolution, resolution by Sri Lanka for Sri Lanka," he said. "It was a great victory for this government. India, China, Russia, etc., commended Sri Lanka's move." He stated that the Udalagama and Paranagama Commission reports, include recommendations more worse than those in the co-sponsored UNHRC Resolution, adding that the Paranagama Report says that the Channel 4 footage on Sri Lanka's killing field is true and should be investigated.
He said that an office for the missing would be set up on Sri Lanka. The legal background would be discussed during next year. He said that an environment would be created for youth in the North and South so that they would not be misled again.
He said the assistance of foreign experts have been taken during inquiries into the S W R D Bandaranaike, Lalith Athulathmudali, Lakshman Kadirgarmar and Ravi Raj assassinations.
"The reputation of the armed forces could be protected only by inquiring into the allegations," Minister Samaraweera said. He said if allegations were not inquired into, the armed forces would be responsible for the wrong doings of an individual or two."
The Minister further stated that the people in the South too could request for an inquiry into the murder of 600 police personnel and other grievances by the LTTE.
"We stood with Mahinda Rajapaksa in the past due to the grievances of mothers in the South, for the rights of Wimal Weerawansa who was engaged in terrorist activities at a time with the support of the international community," Minister Samaraweera said. "So don't we have the right to stand for the rights of the people in the North of the country, he questioned."
'RAW active in the North'
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake told Parliament yesterday, that India's spy agency research and Analysis wing (RAW) is engaged in a campaign to destabilize the North. Today Jaffna has become a den of the RAW. The international intervention in local affairs have always been detrimental to the national interests.
Jaffna people thought that India would help them. There was no such help when the conflict was worsening. Jaffna people learnt too late that India was - self-serving in the guise of helping them. Today the area is infested with RAW agents and their activities have been the target of destabilizing the North.

Democracy in the Digital Era
Address by the Deputy Speaker of Parliament Thilanga Sumathipala, Parliament of Sri Lanka on October 18, 2015, at the 133rd sessions of the Inter Parliaamentary Union (IPU), Geneva, Switzerland
Topic: Democracy in the Digital Era and the threat to privacy and individual freedom
Chairman, colleagues, ladies and gentlemen present at this august gathering, Greetings from Sri Lanka!
It is my pleasure to address you on the topic: 'Democracy in the digital era, and the threats it can pose to privacy and individual freedoms.'
As we all know, what we want for ourselves is freedom of expression which is a fundamental right at the heart of any democratic society.
However, it is also restricted by other important values, including the right to privacy and individual freedoms. Of concern is the misuse of private information, leading to infiltration of an individual's private life and family.
The International Telecommunications Union (ITU), has 193 member states and according to the ITU, there are billions of mobile phone subscribers, around five billion people with access to television and tens of millions of internet users every year.
We have moved from Analog to Digital and the transformation has been remarkable. Digital democracy has flourished in almost all parts of the world and online sites have become the platform for vibrant
discussions and debates across the globe. In fact, some websites are engaged in exposing corruption and official excesses. They, thereby, contribute towards good governance while also ensuring the right to information.
In the digital era, social media has surpassed the print media as a purveyor of information. The internet, for example, disseminates news and opinions, including intimate, private information of individuals; similarly, social media blogs and other online sites also provide easy and free access to information - both public and private. As such, it has led to many people concluding that there is no recourse to legal protection. This has also led to the belief that there is potent threat to privacy, dignity and individual freedoms.
The latest statistics reveal that one in every four Sri Lankans, regularly use the internet while Facebook clearly dominates with over 2.5 million accounts as at end of December 2014. In addition, youth, especially, are predominant users of the Twitter, WhatsApp, Viber and Youtube.
You would be interested to know that of Sri Lanka's population of over 20 million people, 4.7 million are internet users, 2.8 million are active users of social media, there are 27.4 million mobile connections which show that there is a very large percentage of the population having more than one connection. In addition, 2.2 million people are active social mobile users.
But we have to bear in mind not only the good side of social media - it also has a bad and an ugly side to it - as witnessed globally - the use of bad language, promoting extremism and violence, exposure to pornography, among other negative practices.
As we are aware, the law is locked in a struggle to reconcile privacy, individual freedoms and free speech within a democratic frame-work.
In Sri Lanka, technological innovations have been used as a tool for a change towards democracy. Social media networks, through their penetration, have facilitated and spurred citizens to engage in organizing and generating awareness of political mobilization towards democracy, as witnessed during the Presidential and General Elections held this year. In my view, the digital world is more controllable -we have better clarity; better quality and I would like to emphasize, we can have better control! And regulation can be put in place. Even though technological advancements can pose a virtual threat to democratic rights, the digital world can be controlled, whereas Analog could not have been controlled. The ITU sets and publishes regulations and standards relevant to electronic communication and broadcasting technologies.

PM intervenes to solve Wimal's issue - Kiriella
Leader of the House and Minister Lakshman Kiriella yesterday informed Parliament that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has intervened to give clearance for NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa to visit Europe. MP Weerawansa was at the BIA in the wee hours of yesterday to travel to Italy as part of his official tour to Europe, but, was detained for the passport he was using had expired.
"We know that no matter where he goes, he will definitely return to the country. That is why the Prime Minister took measures to solve this problem and the MP to allow the MP to leave the country as planned," Minister Kiriella said.
MEP Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardene informed Speaker Karu Jayasuriya that MP Weerawansa had been stopped at the BIA and that the authorities had questioned him citing that there was a court order preventing MP Weerawansa from leaving the country.
Speaker Jayasuriya also said he was not informed by any authority on this matter.

Minister Kiriella later informed the House that MP Weerawansa was detained at the BIA for having an invalid passport in his possession.

Ranil's plea to MPs: "Give up polecat politics and agree for consensual political culture"
The Parliamentary debate on the country's Human Rights record and the mechanism to probe the alleged war crimes was a moment of retrospection to come to terms with the past and open the doors for a harmonious future.
It signalled the Government's willingness to begin the much needed discourse on the uneasy topic which the previous government was digging in its heels. The debate carried a true sense of introspection and was a difficult step forward in mending the broken hearts of those in the North and the South.
However, it was never an easy task for the communal hardliners of both sides to break out of their cocoon and face up to the reality. On the other hand, it clearly exposed those who vociferously fan communal passions for their own political survival.
The adjournment motion pertaining to the UNHRC resolution on Sri Lanka was presented by UNP MP Ajith Mannaperuma. Two full dates had been allocated for the debate even excluding a lunch break. Providing materials for a constructive debate, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tabled the much awaited reports of 'Udalagama' and 'Paranagama' Presidential Commissions of Inquiry along with the OHCHR report in Parliament on Tuesday.
Findings of Paranagama Commission
These reports delved deeply into the alleged killings and disappearances of people during the last phase of war and several years before that. Both those Presidential Commissions were mandated during the tenure of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa when the pressure was surmounting to investigate over the alleged human rights violations and disappearances. However, the reports were not in public domain until they were presented in Parliament.
The findings of Paranagama Commission once again brought the brutalities committed by the LTTE to the limelight, and reiterated that the LTTE was responsible for the majority of killings of civilians during the final phase of the war. At the same time, the report also reversed the belief entrenched in the minds of the people in the South by the former Government that there had been 'zero civilian casualties' on the part of the Sri Lankan Army.
The commission also rejects the highly controversial estimation of 40,000 civilian deaths mentioned in the Darusman Report. Masrzuki Drusman was a member of the International Independent Group of Eminent Persons (IIGEP) appointed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and worked along with Justice P. N. Bhagawati (former Chief justice of India) who headed the IIGEP. However in the same tenor the Paranagama Commission observes the Channel 4 documentary on war crimes and extra-judicial killings was "unlikely to be faked" and proposes an independent inquiry into it.
The Udalagama Commission was given 15 selected cases to investigate on the alleged serious violations of human rights. However, the Commission had only completed investigations into seven cases within the mandated period, as it had consumed much time to investigate on the case of killing 17 INGO aid workers in 2006 and the case of killing five youths in Trincomalee in 2006. There were altogether nine printed volumes tabled in Parliament, two pertaining to the Commission headed by retired High Court Judge Maxwell Paranagama, and seven pertaining to the Commission headed by retired Supreme Court Judge Nissanka Udalagama.
It was hard to imagine that the MPs had enough time to properly study these reports before the debate, rather than rushing through their pages. Moreover, the bundles of those documents tied up by a ribbon were seen untouched on the benches of some MPs even on the day of the debate.
UNHRC Resolution
Interestingly, the ethnic hardliners of both sides of the divide were on the same page with regard to the UNHRC Resolution. They plainly rejected it on the extremist grounds. It is said 'the communal extremism on one side breeds that of the other side'. The two provocative speeches of NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa and TNA MP Mavai Senathirajah proved it beyond doubt.
Weerawansa making a blistering speech castigated the Government for co-sponsoring the UNHRC Resolution stating it was an act of betrayal of the war heroes. He spoke with his usual pseudo-patriotic rhetoric to add more fuel to the anxieties of war heroes' families.
"There will be international judges, prosecutors, lawyers and investigators to probe into war crimes. The war heroes will be tried before a hybrid court. Once the prisoners under the Prevention of Terrorism Act are freed, they will go before the court to give witnesses against war heroes", he narrated.
However, Weerawansa was roundly criticized for his rabid chauvinism by many who joined in the debate later. Minister Dilan Perera making a sharp criticism, stated a few in the UPFA was responsible was dragging the SLFP into an extreme communal line.
"The SLFP will never give way for communalism again. We are pursuing consensual politics as we want to find a lasting solution to the national question", he insisted.
Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne trod upon some uneasy revelations against the Sri Lankan Government forces made in the Paranagama Commission report involving the Channel 4 documentary and some alleged killings during the last phase of war. It indicated his readiness for a frank discussion which had been suppressed for six long years after the war. "Admit the bare truth that the UNHRC report and the resolution were watered down to a great extent. The domestic mechanism will be established within the powers of Sri Lankan judicial system," he stressed.
The standpoint of TNA MP M. A. Sumanthiran with regard to the Geneva Resolution carried food for thought and his views on the subject deserved to be applauded. His voice no doubt represented the official stance of the TNA. The tenor of his speech indicated their readiness to get rid of narrow communal politics.
"The weakening of several clauses in the Resolution has hurt our feelings, but we support the Government for its full implementation.
The UNHRC report not only highlighted the crimes committed by the Government forces, but also the LTTE. Yet, we welcomed the entire report. We are ready to lead our people in that painful process of introspection to know the failures and crimes on the part of our own community.
This is a must if we are to move forward. Let's deal with the investigations justly, honestly and transparently", he appealed.
Amidst a very useful and constructive debate on the resolution the sittings had to be suspended abruptly for a few minutes, as the UPFA minor coalition partners led by MP Dinesh Gunawardena behaved aggressively attempting to grab the Mace and run. The reason was a dispute over time allocation for the speech of MP Weerawansa. Weerawansa, who was waiting for his turn, became impatient as he was not given the opportunity by the chair. Observing that the speeches allowed in the House so far reflected only favourable viewpoints to the Government, Weerawansa wanted his turn without further delay. He reminded that the debate was initially asked by them.
MP Dinesh Gunawardena making aggressive comments at this point rushed to the Mace.
The Deputy Sergeant-at-arms prevented him from grabbing the Mace, but Gunawardena violently pushed him and carried the Mace to the middle of the well leading to the suspension of the House. Minister Mangala Samaraweera was seen intervening to solve the matter while the sittings remained suspended. When the sittings resumed, Weerawansa was allowed to make his speech.
Former President and Kurunegala District MP Mahinda Rajapaksa did not turn up during the first day of the adjournment debate, but he was expected on the next day. Rajapaksa was quick to react to the Geneva Resolution and asked the Government to reject it. Meanwhile, MP Bandula Gunawardena, who was a vociferous critique of the Government, had to face a rather difficult time in Parliament this week as his very own words boomeranged back on him. He was asking for trouble when he called the Finance Minister by the name 'Karunanayake Ravindra Sandresh Ganeshan' with tainted intentions to insult him in communal line.
Even though Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella pointed out the mistake, Gunawardena was reluctant to accept it. Instead he challenged to resign from his Parliamentary seat if he was proven wrong. However, later on the same day the MP admitted that he was wrong. Yet, that remark alone was not enough to right the wrong.
Minister Ravi Karunanayake took arms against Gunawardena over this matter next day. He demanded that the MP should resign. As the pressure was building, Gunawardena attempted to extenuate himself by stating it was a human error and that he did not intend to insult anybody.
Kiriella demanded that MP Gunawardena must leave the Chamber at least for a short time keeping to his own words. The backbenches in the Government stood up and protested against Gunawardena's presence in the Chamber, and in return a few UPFA MPs in the Opposition too were standing and shouting at the Government members.
Opportunity to correct the past mistakes
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya after making numerous attempts to maintain the decorum of the House had no other choice but to suspend sittings abruptly for five minutes. However, the Speaker's frustration was seen when he mentioned that Rs 4.6 million of public money is spent on each sitting day, adding that Parliament should conduct properly giving priority for public business. Mr. Jayasuriya was emphatic that the time and money spent on sittings should be utilised in a meaningful manner without being wasted.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe commencing the debate on the second day, made an earnest plea from all members not to hamper the golden opportunity to correct the past mistakes and clear the way forward for a better tomorrow.
His determination to solve the ethnic crisis was reiterated, while urging all members to put the old vituperative traditions in politics to rest at this crucial juncture and invited them to join together for a new consensual political culture. "I make only one request from you. Please give up the ugly 'polecat' politics.
The polecat is always in the dark. Likewise there are politicians who can never do politics in day light. Let us seek justice for all. Only a few Colombo based pseudo patriots and pro-LTTE diaspora are against this endeavour", he explained.
The Government in the meantime managed to pass a number of key financial legislations this week despite continuous uproar by a few regular noisemakers in Parliament belonging to the UPFA rebel group.
These included a number of financial bills the Government could not pass during its interim period as it did not command the majority in Parliament. The Resolution under the Local Treasury Bills Ordinance, which was defeated by the Opposition on April 7, also sailed through Parliament quite easily when it was presented last Tuesday.

Road accidents kill 1.25 m annually, Africa deadliest - WHO
SWITZERLAND: Some 1.25 million people are killed in traffic accidents around the world each year, with Africa by far the continent with the most dangerous roads, the World Health Organization said in report published Monday.
"Road traffic fatalities take an unacceptably high toll, particularly on poor people in poor countries," WHO chief Margaret Chan said in a statement. The UN health agency's Global Status Report on Road Safety showed that the situation is improving, with the number of deaths remaining stable in recent years even as the number of cars and other vehicles on the road has increased rapidly. But traffic accidents are still the leading cause of death among 15- to 29-year-olds worldwide and cost governments on average about 3.0 percent of their annual gross domestic products, the report showed.

Scientists trigger artificial quake in Japan
JAPAN: Researchers on Thursday triggered an artificial earthquake on a mountain in Japan in search of data to help find signs of possible volcanic eruptions.
Mount Zao is 1841 metres high and located between Miyagi and Yamagata prefectures. It has become active since the massive earthquake in March 2011, with increased volcanic tremors, public broadcaster NHK reported.
A team from Tohoku University, together with Meteorological Agency officials, conducted a new survey of the volcano in the early hours of Thursday. They detonated about 200 kg of dynamite inside a 40-metre deep hole dug on the mountain side.
Water poured inside the hole spewed out with the force of the blast. Seismic waves from the blast were measured by about 150 seismometers placed on the mountain.
Since seismic waves travel more slowly through water, analysis of seismometer data enables researchers to estimate pools and pathways of hot water up to about two km underground. Tohoku University Professor Satoshi Miura says finding out the locations of hot water is a key to guessing where the next steam-blast explosion could occur.
Mount Zao last erupted in 1940.

Sri Lanka Guru Sangamaya Chairman Priyantha Fernando has been interdicted from the Teachers Service for travelling abroad by obtaining leave approved in contravention of the AR and FR Regulations.
He had been interdicted from service twice earlier for not performing his duties as a teacher even for a single day. It is also alleged that Priyantha Fernando's wife who is also a teacher had stuck to a single school in Anuradhapura town continuously for nine years without getting transferred by allegedly misusing the trade union powers of her husband.
Other Principals and teachers in the area had been critical about the arbitrary actions of these two people. They alleged that Priyantha Fernando spearheaded protest campaigns to sabotage the education development plan initiated by NCP Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne when he was Provincial Education Minister.
Although he was under interdiction and a disciplinary inquiry he had been reinstated by the new Provincial Education Minister K.H. Nandasena notwithstanding opposition from teachers and many other quarters.

Truth, justice and non-recurrence crucial for true reconciliation - Opposition Leader
The truth, justice, reparation and non-recurrence are the crucial words in the process in achieving true reconciliation, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said in Parliament yesterday.
Participating in the adjournment debate, he welcomed the initiative of the All Party Meeting chaired by the President. "All political party leaders and representatives, who met at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday accepted that there must be a speedy solution to address the national question," he said.
We are happy that the vast majority of the House has now realised the shortcomings of the past," the Opposition Leader said.
"We have a long way to go before we achieve real progress on reconciliation and lasting peace. The way to start would be by truly and honestly fully implementing the UNHRC Resolution," he observed. Sampanthan also noted the recently concluded UNHRC session proved that Sri Lanka has been able to win back the trust of the international community.
While urging the government to strictly observe and follow the Resolution, he noted truth seeking as to what had actually happened during the last phase of war is necessary.
Referring to a political solution, he said it should not become a 'political football kicked around'. "We need to seriously and calmly address on what needs to be done. We need to take all people with us on this journey. The victims must not be looked upon," he added. Sampanthan replying to a comment by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Dissanayake, stated the TNA always wanted to solve the issues of Tamils within the country, but, they were not given due attention.
"Dissanayake made an appeal to the TNA, that we should not rush to India and international community to find solutions to the issues faced by our community. I agree. At the same time let me also remind that the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayagam Pact was not signed in Delhi. The Dudley Senanayake-Chelvanayagam Pact was not signed in Washington. There were signed in Sri Lanka," he said. Whenever the Tamils agitated over their problems and held a Sathyagraha as a peaceful means of protesting, they were subjected to violence.
That was the reason for the birth of the LTTE. This entire issue was a result of the failure to address the Tamil question in a reasonable way. We did rush to India, Europe or the USA," he stressed.

Alleged use of invalid passport
Wimal granted bail
Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa who was arrested by the CID for attempting to leave the country by an invalid passport was released on bail by Negombo Additional Magistrate Thilakaratne Bernard. He was released on a cash bail of Rs.10,000 with two personal sureties worth Rs.one million.
The CID arrested MP Weerawansa at the Bandaranaike International Airport last morning when the latter attempted to leave the country by an invalid passport.
Weerawansa who was to leave for a number of countries in Europe, including Italy was arrested for questioning by the CID after the Immigration and Emigration Department officials informed the CID with regard
to the discrepancy of his passport. The CID officials also recorded a lengthy statement from Weerawansa. The Department officials on duty at the BIA found that the passport of MP Weerawansa has been invalid after feeding the details of his passport to the system.
The MP who had behaved in an aggreesive manner after being informed that his passport was invalid was later questioned by the CID.
Parliamentarian Werawansa had obtained a new passport recently as he has lost his passport. His passport has been categorized in the 'lost list" after the parliamentarian was issued a new passport. However Weerawansa has produced his cancelled passport to the Immigration and Emigration officials at the BIA, instead of his news passport.
Weerawansa had accepted his fault by himself and he had told the CID that he found his previous passport when he moved house.
The MP has said that he failed to inform it to the Immigration and Emigration Department.
Police sources told the Daily News that Parliamentarian Weerawansa has obtained a police report from Talangama police stating that he lost his diplomatic passport.
The MP has reportedly obtained a new diplomatic passport by producing the police report. Weerawansaa obtained his first diplomatic passport in 2011 and applied for another diplomatic passport in 2012 stating that he lost his previous passport.
He had travelled to many countries by using this passport till 2014. However, the MP has not toured overseas after the defeat of UPFA at the last Presidential election.
It has been reported that he was to participate in a launch of book titled "Suddange Adhikarane ha Jathiye Awanaduwa in a number of countries in Europe, including France and Italy.
