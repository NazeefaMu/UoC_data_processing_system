PM to address first national summit on foresight and innovation

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will address Sri Lankas first National Summit on Foresight and Innovation for Sustainable Human Development on may 24.
It will be organised by the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and the National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry.
The Prime Minister is expected to speak at a high-level plenary themed Re-imagining Governance: An Opportunity for Sri Lanka.
The Summit, held together with Science, Technology and Research Ministry, Sarvodaya, LIRNEasia, the United Nations Global Compact (UNGC) and Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC) as Core Partners and Ceylon Biscuits Limited as a Summit Partner, will focus on starting a national dialogue on the importance of foresight and innovation as a value addition to traditional development planning to achieve sustainable human development and the 2030 development agenda.
The two day Summit, which will take place on May 24 and 25 at Waters Edge, Battaramulla, will also be attended by Science, Technology and Research Minister Susil Premajayantha, Digital Infrastructure and Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando. They are expected to engage in a panel discussion on Disruptive Innovation.
The Summit will connect many international resource people including those from the UN Pulse Lab - Jakarta, the UNDP Centre for Public Service Excellence - Singapore, myForesight  Malaysia, Mind Lab - Denmark, GIZ Germany, Superflux - UK, UNDP Kolba Lab  Armenia, UNDP MiLab  Moldova, eGov Centre  Moldova, Fields of View - India, etc.
UNDP Country Director Jorn Sorensen speaking about this collaboration, said, As the development arm of the United Nations working in Sri Lanka for the past five decades, we are extremely proud to be able to connect a diverse set of resource people internationally, and convene all key players in the development sector in Sri Lanka.
Meanwhile, National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Niroshan Perera, speaking on the importance of this summit said, Sri Lanka is at a crucial juncture; we must now choose to look outwards and beyond the present context to create the future we want.
Through this Summit we will develop and learn foresight tools from a national planning and policy point of view, which will prove pivotal over the next 15 years as national and international contexts grow more complex and challenging.
Foresight and Innovation are rapidly becoming tools that governments and other non-traditional partners for development are incorporating into their work. Through these methodologies, they seek to create coherent policy frameworks that will effectively utilise limited resources. Understanding emerging trends and opportunities whilst successfully evading inevitable challenges is key. This Summit, will thus contribute to enhancing development practices and policies that are visionary, to create the world we want and need by 2030 by fostering a development sector that is forward-thinking and visionary.
Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera is expected to join the launch of UNDPs 50th anniversary celebrations titled Shared Goals. Shared Prosperity: 50 years in Sri Lanka and Beyond at the end of the summit.

SLC to approach ICC for compensation

SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that now that the ICC had admitted there was a flaw in the tests carried out by the Qatar laboratory on the urine samples of Sri Lanka cricketer Kusal Perera there was a case for seeking financial redress from the sports international governing body.
Without Pereras personal expenses we have so far spent to about Rs. 13 million, revealed Sumathipala. Now that we have proved beyond reasonable doubt that Kusal is innocent and he is not guilty and that the ICC has agreed with our scientific case that we are right, as a player he has a claim.
We will discuss with ICC separately with regard to certain payment of the costs which I am certain we want to refrain at the moment. I am confident we got the hard part right and we have a definite claim. We cant sour the relationship with ICC but we are hopeful that something can be worked out. We have to definitely get our costs back. The indirect cost is colossal we will try to discuss that separately, he said.
We will have to take a different approach to this in consultation with the cricketer, lawyers and get advice and direction from the Sports Minister how we can handle this in the future.
Sumathipala also recalled how SLC had fought out the case with the ICC on throwing and the banning of the doosra and brought about a change in the rules in defence of former Sri Lanka spinner Muthiah Muralitharan who went onto become the highest wicket-taker in Test history with 800 wickets.
In the entire letter from the ICC it has been confirmed that the lawyers whom we have retained and the scientific evidence that was given on Perera has educated and taken the ICC into a different level of how they should work with this kind of situations in the future, Sumathipala added.  ST

## Title: ICCs FULL STATEMENT ON KUSAL PERERA
## Supertitle:

ICCs FULL STATEMENT ON KUSAL PERERA

In November 2015, the WADA-accredited laboratory in Qatar reported to the ICC that urine samples collected out-of-competition from Sri Lankan international player, Kusal Perera, had tested positive for 19-Norandrostenedione, an anabolic steroid prohibited under WADAs Prohibited List.
Pursuant to the ICCs WADA-compliant anti-doping code, the full laboratory documentation packages in respect of each of the findings were reviewed by three members of the ICCs Independent Review Board (comprising of world leaders in the medical, scientific and legal fields of anti-doping), each of whom independently confirmed that Mr Perera had a case to answer. Accordingly, on 7 December 2015, the ICC charged Mr Perera with an anti-doping rule violation and, in accordance with the mandatory requirements of the code, provisionally suspended Mr Perera until that charge was resolved.
Since that time, the ICC has worked with Mr Pereras lawyers as they have attempted to identify the source of the 19-Norandrostenedione found in the samples. As part of those efforts, the ICC sought further information from the Qatar laboratory and granted various extensions of time to the players legal team to allow it to carry out additional analysis and investigation work. In addition, the Qatar laboratory analysed the B samples provided by Mr Perera in January 2016, and reported that that analysis confirmed the presence of the same substance in those samples.
In a recent letter, Mr Pereras lawyers provided an update on their investigation into potential sources of the 19-Norandrostenedione found in his samples, but also suggested for the first time that the Qatar laboratory might have misidentified impurities in the samples as 19-Norandrostenedione, given the very low concentrations of that substance found in the samples.
In response, the ICC commissioned an independent expert to review all of the Qatar laboratorys findings. Whilst the independent expert concluded that the Qatar laboratory had correctly identified 19-Norandrostenedione in the samples, that experts view was that an adverse analytical finding by the laboratory was not sustainable, because, for various scientific and technical reasons, it could not be ruled out that the 19-Norandrostenedione was produced naturally in the players body and/or formed in the samples after the player provided them. These concerns were immediately presented by the ICC to the Qatar laboratory, which has today confirmed that it has withdrawn the Adverse Analytical Finding and is instead reporting an Atypical Finding. It has advised that no specific further investigation of the players two samples is warranted, but has recommended the monitoring of the players steroid profile moving forward.
As a result, the ICC has immediately withdrawn the disciplinary proceedings previously brought against Mr Perera, and he is therefore free to train and compete domestically and internationally again without restriction with immediate effect.
ICC Chief Executive David Richardson said: Cricket is proud of its compliance with the structures and systems required by WADA and takes comfort from the fact that samples are tested in accordance with WADA-approved standards and at WADA-accredited laboratories. However, the ICC is troubled in this case by the fact that the Qatar laboratory has issued an Adverse Analytical Finding that has then had to be withdrawn and replaced with an Atypical Finding.
Whilst I am confident that this is an isolated incident in respect of tests commissioned by the ICC, we are seeking an urgent explanation from WADA and the laboratory in an attempt to understand what has transpired and what will be done to ensure it does not happen again. We will also immediately review our own internal processes to see whether there might be additional steps over and above those required by WADA that the ICC could put in place in order to give international cricketers further comfort.
He went on to say: Had it not been for the diligence of Mr Pereras legal team and the ICCs own desire to uncover the explanation for the reported findings, the consequences could well have been different, and that should be of concern to all involved in the fight against doping. We regret what Mr Perera has had to endure, and would like to commend him for the manner in which he has conducted himself throughout this period.
We wish to make it clear that there is no evidence that Mr Perera has ever used performance-enhancing substances and we wish him well in his future cricketing endeavours.

Issue was resolved because of a elected body  Sports Minister

Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera said that Sri Lanka was able to handle the doping issue concerning cricketer Kusal Perera successfully because there was a democratically elected body in place.
If there was no elected body in place today I dont think we would have been able to save Kusal Perera, said Minister Jayasekera.
This is the lesson learnt by everyone today. We were in the ICC only as an observer and did not have any status to be part of being a decision-making representative.Today Thilanga Sumathipala as the elected president of SLC can go to the ICC and make representations on behalf of Sri Lanka.
All this time we did not have that status because of an interim committee. This is the right decision this government has taken. Sumathipala can take up any issues concerning Sri Lanka and thrash it out with the ICC, he said.
The Minister also further stated Perera had suffered a financial loss in his career by the ban or he could have been chosen to play in the IPL and earned millions of rupees.
He was deprived of playing is many international games. As Sports Minister I am very much concerned for the player because and for SLC it was a big loss because had he been available for selection we could have performed much better in the World T20, said Jayasekera. All this we need to discuss with the ICC and expect Sumathipala to do so in a very cordial manner. - ST

Sri Lanka likely to be Pakistan's new 'home'
Pakistan Cricket Board said it failed to make any handsome profits from its "home series" held in the United Arab Emirates since 2009.
Pakistan are considering shifting their base out of the United Arab Emirates for the series against the West Indies later this year and Sri Lanka have emerged on top of their priority list.
This comes after the Pakistan Cricket Board failed to make any handsome profits from its "home series" held in Dubai, Abu Dhabi and Sharjah since 2009. Organizing matches in the UAE have been highly expensive, a board official said.
The PCB has been forced to host its "home series" regularly in the UAE since terrorist attack on Sri Lankan team in Lahore in March, 2009, leading to Test teams refusing to tour the country citing serious security concerns.
Since 2009, the PCB has only hosted short limited-overs series at home against lowly ranked teams like Zimbabwe (last year in May), Kenya and Afghanistan.
But even before 2009 the PCB had hosted some of its "home series" against Australia and West Indies in the UAE as they expressed security concerns about playing in Pakistan.
Matter under discussion
"We are discussing the matter within the board and we will also speak to other boards to study the feasibility of such a move but we are looking at moving our home series to Sri Lanka," the official confirmed.
He said that the Sri Lankan board had in the past been receptive when proposals were discussed for Pakistan to host their series there.
"They were receptive even when there was a chance we might host India in a short last January but the move didn't materialize," he said.
UAE too costly
The official said the PCB had incurred expenses in millions on just paying the ground rent for the Pakistan Super League which was launched last February in Dubai and Sharjah.
The PCB says it has lost millions of dollars in estimated revenues because of being forced to host its series in UAE because teams had security concerns about playing in Pakistan.
