Havies are looking forward to regain League rugby title
Havelock Sports Club founded in 1915 is a Division A rugby union team based in Sri Lanka that plays in the Dialog Rugby League. The Club has a long history and Rugby is the clubs main sporting activity.
The Havies, as they are commonly known amongst its members, is situated in Colombo and the clubs ground is known as Havelock Park. The club has produced some excellent players over the last few decades including Sri Lankan Nationals such as Michael Jayasekera, Hisham Abdeen, Graham Raux, Sanjeewa Jayasinghe and Rajeev Ganapathy.
The club has struggled over the last decade to retain its players with their star performers crossing over to more star-powered clubs. They were once down and out even to find 15 players to represent the club rugby side but Stormed in to recognition in 2012/13 season with the help of several ex CR and FC players together with the guidance of knowledgeable Samoan coach Tevita Tulagaise affectionately called as Laga to all his close friends by winning the coveted league Crown under prop forward Terence Henry after a lapse of almost close to four decades.
They beat the defending champions at that time the formidable Kandy Sports Club, who were the champions for the preceding 10 years.
The brain child behind this famous victory is none-other than ex CR and FC stalwart Asanga Seneviratne who suddenly took over Havies that year and within the period of three to four months transformed a ordinary bunch of players to a fighting unit, capable of giving a fight to other top clubs such as CR and FC, Navy and Kandy by being a dominant force in local rugby arena.
Seneviratne, who is the current head of the Sri Lanka Rugby Football Union, has changed the face of Havies Rugby over the last several years by helping them find sponsors through companies he controls, which has helped lift the standards of the club on-field and off-field.
A new stadium has been built with games being played under lights. Sri Lankan national prop forward Dushmantha Priyadarshana will captain the Havelocks SC this upcoming 2016/17 season in the Dialog league rugby tournament and the Clifford cup knock out championship.
While the club has drafted in the vastly experienced former national Coach Ronnie Ibrahim as the head coach of the team in this years rugby season, Sri Lanka national players of the caliber of Diren Warnakulasuriya, Ganuka Dissanayaka and Danushka Ranjan have left the club and joined Kandy SC and Police SC respectively while national captain Sudarshana Muthutantri has not turn out for practices yet at Havelocks this season.
Theres a good news for Havies as former Havies, Navy SC, Police SC and national Winger Chamara Dabare has returned to his old club and Navy SC and Sri Lanka national third row forward Yoshitha Rajapaksha along with ex Isipahana and Police SC nippy scrum half Sudam Sooriarachchi also has joined the club and will most probably play for the pink and chocolate Jerseys this season.
Havelocks Squad: Dushmantha Priyadarshana (Captain), Vimukthi Rahula, Ramesh Fernando, Chamara Dabare, Kevin Dixon, Hirantha Perera, Dulaj Perera, Shehan Dias, Devinda Pathiranage, Senal Deelaka, Lasindu Karunathilaka, Ashwanth Herath, Ganidu Lakshan, Sharo Fernando, Mithun Hapugoda, Chamika Kusal, Prasath Madhushanka, Ijaaz Ahamed, Liston Flalny, Salinda Chamara, Viraj Fernando, Ashan Darling, Jason Melder, Hafiz Adahan, Udara Anjana, Niroshan Fernando, Rohitha Rajapakse, Nishon Perera, Samantha Lakshan.
Havies will come out for the first time this season against the formidable Air Force side on Saturday the 5th November at 4.00pm in Air Force grounds in Ratmalana.

Bangladesh player acquitted in maid torture case
DHAKA Sunday: A Bangladesh court on Sunday acquitted cricketer Shahadat Hossain and his wife on charges of torturing an 11-year-old girl whom he employed as a maid, a prosecutor said.
Police last year charged the 30-year-old fast bowler and his wife Nritto Shahadat with assault and torture after the young girl was found crying by the roadside with her eyes bruised and swollen.
The couple have been released as the prosecution failed to prove them guilty, prosecutor Ali Asgar from the women and children repression prevention tribunal told AFP.
The couple pleaded not guilty to the charges which were brought after the girl lodged complainst against them.
The cricketer spent two months in custody after surrendering to police in October last year, and his wife was arrested.
Hossain was later released on bail, as was his wife. But he remained banned from all forms of the game by the Bangladesh Cricket Board during the investigation into the alleged criminal offence, which drew huge media interest. In May the authorities allowed Hossain to play domestic cricket due to humanitarian considerations until his case was settled, clearing the way for his appearance in the lucrative Bangladesh Premier League.
But the fast bowler has not been picked by any BPL side for the current season.
Before his ban Hossain played 38 Tests for Bangladesh, bagging 72 wickets, and 51 one-day internationals in which he took 47.
The truth has won, he said after the verdict.
Asked whether he hopes to return to the national team, he told AFP: I still have something to give to my country. -AFP

Pacquiao reclaims WBO title for third time
LAS VEGAS Sunday: Filipino star Manny Pacquiao reclaimed the World Boxing Organization welterweight title for the third time with a unanimous decision victory over former champion Jesse Vargas in his comeback fight on Saturday.
The 37-year-old Pacquiao, who announced his retirement seven months ago after beating Timothy Bradley, knocked Vargas down in the second round en route to a decisive victory at the Thomas & Mack Center.
Pacquiao, 59-6 with two drawn and 38 knockouts, showed he still has a lot left in the tank but failed to get the knockout victory that has eluded him for the past seven years.
All three judges scored the bout for Pacquiao, two of them by 118-109 and the other by 114-113.
Pacquiao won the WBO title for the first time in 2010 when he beat Miguel Cotto.
He lost it two years later to Bradley, then got it back by winning the rematch with Bradley in 2014. He then lost it last year to the now-retired Floyd Mayweather, who had a front row seat for Saturdays bout.
Pacquiao took time off to concentrate on his job as a newly elected politician in the Philippine Senate. After serving his first stint as a rookie senator, he says the fire was rekindled and the stage set for a return to boxing.
Pacquiao said he was retiring following his April 9 two-knockdown victory over Bradley in their third fight. Pacquiao looked impressive in stopping Bradley, showing that he has recovered from a shoulder injury which hampered him in his fight against Mayweather in May 2015.
Both fighters felt each other out as very few punches were thrown in the first round.
Pacquiao was the quicker of the two to size up the opponent as the Filipino southpaw learned early on that he could counter Vargas left jab with a right to the face.
Thats what happened in the second round when Pacquiao connected on a counterpunch that sent Vargas stumbling backwards and onto the canvas. - AFP

Zou beats Kwanpichit for first world pro title
LAS VEGAS Sunday: Two-time Olympic gold medalist Zou Shiming claimed the vacant World Boxing Organization flyweight title with a unanimous decision victory over Kwanpichit Onesongchaigym in a rematch on Saturday.
The 35-year-old from China easily outpointed Kwanpichit, winning on all three judges scorecards to capture his first world title. Two judges had it 120-107 while the other scored it 119-108.
Now my dream is complete, said Zou. I am a pro champ, Olympic champ and world champion. The Zou-Kwanpichit fight opened an impressive three-title undercard for Manny Pacquiaos comeback fight against Jessie Vargas at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas.
In one of those title bouts, Jessie Magdaleno seized the WBO junior featherweight title with a unanimous decision over former champion Nonito Donaire of the Philippines.
Zou, who won gold in 2008 at Beijing and 2012 in London, started quickly by winning the opening round and then knocking down the Thai in the second.
With a big size and reach advantage, Zou sent Kwanpichit to the canvas with a perfectly timed right hook to the side of the head with about a minute to go in the round.
Zou improved to 9-1 with two knockouts, with his only loss coming in his first title attempt when he lost to Amnat Ruenroeng in Macau last year.

Ireland stun New Zealand to claim first win over All Blacks
CHICAGO SUNDAY: Ireland ended a century-long losing streak to claim a historic first-ever win over New Zealand here Saturday, sending the All Blacks spinning to a 40-29 defeat with a scintillating display.
Just days after the Windy City erupted in celebration after the Chicago Cubs landed their first World Series baseball crown in 108 years, Ireland booted their own 111-year rugby hoodoo firmly into touch.
Roared on by army of green-clad fans in a 62,300 crowd at Soldier Field, the Irish outscored the All Blacks by five tries to four to seal their first win over the Kiwis in the 29th instalment of a rivalry dating to 1905.
It has been a long time coming and history (has been) made.
We're absolutely ecstatic, Ireland skipper Rory Best said after leading his team on a raucous lap of honor at the famed NFL venue.
We knew they are a great side. You can see how good a side they are and how much it means to our boys to have won that. Ireland were forced to cling on in the closing stages after a ferocious New Zealand fightback, which saw the All Blacks recover from a 30-8 deficit to go within four points at 33-29 with around 15 minutes to go.
But with the crowd roaring them home, Ireland scored a fifth and final try through outstanding center Robbie Henshaw, converted by replacement fly-half Joey Carbery, to clinch a famous victory.
It was New Zealand's first defeat since their loss to Australia in August 2015.
Only last month, the All Blacks had set a world record for consecutive victories with their 18th win in a row. New Zealand's preparations for the Test had been thrown into disarray by the absence through injury of first choice locks Brodie Retallick and Sam Whitelock.
The further absence of second row Luke Romano following a family bereavement had forced them into starting a makeshift pairing of Jerome Kaino and Patrick Tuipulotu.
But New Zealand coach Steve Hansen refused to blame the injury crisis for the loss.
The right side won, Hansen said. The Irish side played very well and congratulations to them.
We don't want to use (the injuries) as an excuse. We trained well enough, we prepared well enough, we thought. We're not going to make any excuses about not having the right people.
The moments before the match had seen Ireland pay an emotional tribute to beloved former international Anthony Foley, who died suddenly last month at the age of 42.
As New Zealand lined up to perform their traditional haka, Ireland's players stood before them in a figure of eight -- a reference to Foley's position.
We felt it was the right thing to do, Best said. There was a lot of emotion.
- Irish seize command early -
Once the game got under way, Ireland wasted no time in exploiting New Zealand's weakness at second row.
Johnny Sexton kicked Ireland ahead with a penalty after only four minutes when French referee Mathieu Raynal whistled the All Blacks for not rolling away at the breakdown.
But New Zealand hit back immediately with the opening try of the game, George Moala finishing off after Waisake Naholo's electrifying break.
Fly-half Beauden Barrett scuffed his conversion attempt to leave New Zealand's lead at 5-3.
Ireland were then handed a crucial advantage after All Black prop Joe Moody was sin-binned for a clear tip tackle on Henshaw.
The ensuing 10-minute period saw Ireland score 12 unanswered point through tries from Jordi Murphy and C.J. Stander to make it 15-5.
Barrett closed the gap to seven points with a penalty after Ireland were offside but Sexton restored Ireland's 10-point lead with a further three-pointer.
Ireland were forced to make a change in the 26th minute when Murphy was stretchered off with what looked like a knee injury, replaced by Josh van der Flier.
But the disruption was fleeting, with scrum-half Conor Murray dummying Aaron Smith to scamper over for Ireland's third try. Sexton converted to make it 25-8 at half-time.
- All Blacks charge late
The second half began with New Zealand looking sharper and faster, but it was Ireland who scored next, Sexton feeding Simon Zebo for 30-8. Yet New Zealand roared back through tries from replacement scrum-half T.J Perenara and Ben Smith to take the score to 30-22. AFP

CICT funds two international-standard courts at SLTA for wheelchair tennis
Wheelchair tennis in Sri Lanka has received a boost following the development of two international standard hard surface courts at the Sri Lanka Tennis Association (SLTA) by Colombo International Container Terminals (CICT) the full-time principal sponsor of the sport.
The two courts, completely refurbished to international match specifications with funds provided by CICT, were formally commissioned recently at a ceremony attended by representatives of CICT, the SLTA, the Sri Lanka Army and players.
Supporting wheelchair tennis is part of our extensive corporate social responsibility commitment to Sri Lanka, and we are pleased to see part of the funds we provide being used to develop two courts for disabled players, CICT CEO Mr Ray Ren said. CICTs support to the SLTAs wheelchair tennis programme is now in its second year, and we have seen tangible results as a result of it.

## Title: Undefeated De Silva puts Sri Lanka in charge

Undefeated De Silva puts Sri Lanka in charge
HARARE, Sunday  An unbeaten century from Dhananjaya de Silva put Sri Lanka in control of the second and final Test against Zimbabwe after a fluctuating first day at Harare Sports Club on Sunday.
De Silva came to the wicket with Sri Lanka struggling on 112 for four after they had lost the toss and been asked to bat, but showed greater application than Sri Lankas top order as he hit his second Test century in just his fifth match.
The right-hander added a crucial 143 for the fifth wicket with Upul Tharanga before finishing unbeaten on 100, as the tourists closed the day on 290 for five.
I knew I needed to bat through the innings, De Silva said afterwards.
Playing under pressure is my role, so it made me comfortable.
Zimbabwe won the toss and elected to bowl first on a pitch boasting a tinge of green, but had a chaotic first hour with the ball.
Fast bowler Carl Mumba limped off the field after the first over, and seamers Chris Mpofu and Donald Tiripano were wayward in their opening spells as Sri Lanka progressed to 62 without loss.
The breakthrough came from an unlikely source, as part-timer Hamilton Masakadza made an early entry to the attack and Dimuth Karunaratne guided an innocuous delivery straight to gully to depart for 26.
Masakadza then struck in his next over when Kusal Pereras decision to attack the seamer from the start of his innings backfired horribly, as he holed out to long-on. Mumba was able to return to the field soon after, but it was fellow fast bowler Mpofu who struck before lunch when he trapped Kaushal Silva lbw for 37. Although Silva asked for a review, he took too long to do so and so his request was denied. Hawk-Eye showed that the delivery from Mpofu would have missed leg stump.
Sri Lanka went to lunch on 105 for three, and were in trouble soon after the interval when Kusal Mendis edged Donald Tiripano behind to depart for 26.
At 112 for four, Sri Lanka were under pressure for the first time in the series but Tharanga and De Silva were unperturbed. The pair were content to take a patient approach as the pitch flattened out and Zimbabwe tightened up their bowling, seeing Sri Lanka through to tea on 187 for four.
We started off badly in the first session, but I think we pulled it back quite nicely as the day wore on, said Masakadza.
We would have been happier with one or two more wickets, but I think after the start that we had, well take it.
Tharanga fell for 79 in the final session, as he became the first player to be given out on review in Zimbabwe, with the third umpire determining that he had edged a delivery from legspinner Graeme Cremer. But De Silva reached three figures shortly before the close of play, and was accompanied to stumps by Asela Gunaratne, who was unbeaten on 13.

Lucky escape for CR beat fighting Army 25-24
The disallowing of two controversial tries by referee Dinka Peiris by Army Sports Club in the second half brought CR & FC a close 25 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalty) to 24 (3 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) win in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby match played at
Racecourse grounds, Reid Avenue yesterday. The winners led 7-3 at half time.
Army dished out a superb second half rally where they came from behind 3-7 down to lead 17-15 but a try 10 minutes before the close and the last minute penalty by CR along with the two disallowed tries by the referee cost them the match in the end.
The match got off to a good start with both teams engaged in a battle for supremacy where CR & FC drew first blood in the 17th minute when their national fly half Tarinda Ratwatte touched down for a try off a beautiful three quarter move covering 40 metres and full back Reeza Mubarak made the conversion, CR led 7 nil.
In the 32nd minute, Army full back Shanaka Kumara put over a penalty to make it 7-3 which was the score at half time.
Soon after the break in the 43rd minute Army centre Imanka Ariyapala who played an outstanding game and stood out from the rest went over for a try off a superb three quarter move. Kumara slotted in the conversion for Army to grab the lead for the first time 10-7.
Within three minutes Red shirts moved the ball wide from right to left where ball changed several hands and finally centre Amila Bandara made a fabulous off load to his co-centre Rehan Silva who dived over for a try near the left corner flag, where Mubarak missed the conversion to go into the lead 12-10.
Army regained the lead in the 52nd minute when their fly half Ashan Bandara ripped off the ball from CR fly half Ratwatte and darted down for a sensational try covering nearly 65 metres. Kumara once again slotted in the conversion for Army to lead 17-12. In the 62nd minute CR cut down the lead with another Mubarak penalty and the score read 17-15 in favour of Army.
Red shirts went in to the lead in the 68th minute when second row forward Dilanka Perera crashed through for a cracking try off a rolling maul.
Mubarak missed the conversion and CR led 22-17.
CR sealed the match in the 77th minute when their reliable place kicker Mubarak put over a fantastic 35 metre penalty to make the score 25-17 in Red shirts favour.
In the final minute Army scored a brilliant consolation try through their captain cum number eight Manoj Silva off a fine three quarter move, where he foxed the CR defence and dived over mid right; replacement full back Gayan Salinda made the conversion and the final score read CR & FC 25 to Army SC 24.

Australia lose four wickets chasing record 539 target
PERTH, Sunday  Emerging South African paceman Kagiso Rabada claimed three crucial wickets as South Africa closed in on victory against Australia on the fourth day of the opening Test in Perth on Sunday.
Set an intimidating victory target of 539, the home side were wobbling on 169 for four at stumps and facing a potential record defeat against South Africa.
Usman Khawaja was on 58 and Mitchell Marsh on 15, with South Africa's unbeaten record at the ground set to be extended. An extraordinary piece of fielding by the diminutive Temba Bavuma removed the dangerous David Warner for 35 to end an opening stand of 52.
Warner dropped the ball in front of him and set off for a quick single, but Bavuma pounced from cover and unleashed a powerful throw while horizontal and still in mid-air.
It rattled the stumps at the non-striker's end with Warner centimetres out of his ground.
The dismissal set the stage for Rabada (3-49) to display his quality in the absence of champion pacemen Dale Steyn due to a shoulder injury suffered on the first day.
Four balls later fellow opener Shaun Marsh (15) was caught at second slip by Faf du Plessis off the bowling of Rabada as Australia suddenly slumped to 52-2.
Things appeared to get even darker for the hosts when new batsman Khawaja was given out caught behind first ball against the part-time spin of JP Duminy. AFP

Brad Pitt seeks joint custody in divorce from Jolie

Brad Pitt is seeking joint custody of his six children in his split from Angelina Jolie, court filings show.
The move comes after Jolie asked for full physical custody of all the children, who are aged eight to 15.
Jolie cited "irreconcilable differences" when she filed to end the marriage on September 19.
Reports suggest that Pitt is being investigated over an incident with his eldest son Maddox on a plane.
A child welfare agency in Los Angeles is examining what happened during the incident on a private flight in mid-September, US media say.
The actors have reached a temporary agreement so the Fight Club star can visit his children while the welfare investigation continues.
California divorce courts generally favour joint custody, but the outcome of the plane row could affect the judge's decision. The actors may also hammer out a deal privately to avoid the matter being aired in public.
Pitt's custody request was included in his response to Jolie's divorce petition. He revealed that the pair separated on September 15, one day after the alleged plane altercation.
Pitt and Jolie have been together since 2004 but only wed in August 2014, at their children's urging. They grew close while filming the 2005 film Mr & Mrs Smith, in which they played a couple in a stagnant relationship.
Their union was Pitt's second marriage, after a divorce from Friends star Jennifer Aniston, and Jolie's third after Billy Bob Thornton and Jonny Lee Miller.
The couple have six children together - Maddox, Pax, and Zahara, who are adopted, and biological children Shiloh and twins Knox and Vivienne.
