Are there sufficient controls for lotteries
While at least six or more draws are being conducted on a daily basis, which includes three from each of the Lottery Boards, it is pertinent to draw the attention of those officials responsible, to ascertain whether precautions are adequate to ensure that no malpractices are committed after the show is recorded at the SLRC studio by 7 p.m.
During this time and the actual telecast of the draw that does take place on National TV at 9.30 p.m., in many places in Colombo tickets are being sold beyond 8 p.m. It is in this context that it is pertinent to find out as to what happens to these tickets sold after the draws at 7 p.m. Are there any winnings or not If it is so valid then the next question arises as to the integrity of the staff, TV crew, and others accommodated with the draw. It is possible that the winnings could be made known to others outside via the mobile phones. With the intense competition between the two boards going head to head, with one outplaying the other, it is imperative that justice is done by those responsible on behalf of the many thousands who are daily trying their luck, sans any outside information from those involved in the draws. This may be an aspect that may have been overlooked up to now, by those concerned and hence needs corrective action as appropriate.
In the alternative the Boards may ban the sale of tickets by 7 p.m., but how feasible this would depend on the dealers and the management of the boards, as there would be a drop in sales if implemented.

Counsel points out high rates for long term Treasury Bonds in 2014
Bringing out a series of private placements issued in 2014 to the attention of the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue,Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva yesterday pointed out that all the referred bonds have been issued above the 11.00 bid rate.
The last 30-year Treasury bond issuance held prior to the questioned auction on February 27,2015, has been the direct placement issuance which has taken place in September 2014.
The accepted bid at the said rate belonged to the Employees Provident Fund.
The last approved direct placement rate for a 30 year bond has been 9.35 which is of the same bond to the EPF.
The rate 9.35 has been looked in comparison with the 12.5 rate at which bonds have been accepted at the February 27,2015 auction.
Former Governor Mahendrans lawyer drawing attention to 30 and 20 year tenure Treasury bonds issued in 2014 to EPF, First Capital, Wealth Trust, NSB and Perpetual Treasuries Limited, pointed out the rates at which they were issued have been 11.29, 11.32, 11.41, 11.68, 11.70 and 11.75.
De Silva then pointed out that both the EPF and the NSB have purchased long tenure Treasury bonds at lower rates such as 10.00, 9.38, 8.85 and 9.45 by the end of 2014.
He suggested that the Public Debt Department has manipulated the market by using the EPF and the NSB, which are captive sources, making them bid at lower rates for long tenure Treasury bonds.
He also pointed out that there has been a 142 basis point drop within 15 days in late 2014 due to the said manipulation.
De Silva was leading evidence through the Senior Assistant Director Steffie Fernando, attached to the Public Debt Department, Front Office who was testifying before the Presidential Commission yesterday.
Mahendrans lawyer also questioned Fernando regarding the Public Debt Departments inability to raise the government requirement in the months of January and February in 2015.
De Silva asked if Fernando is aware that the Public Debt Department was short of Rs.19 billion and Rs.9 billion each month respectively, from the total requirement of funding set out by the government to the Central Bank.
Acting Auditor General Dappula de Livera rose to object the line of questioning done by De Silva, which led to an argument between the two. De Livera said de Silva is trying to manipulate the witness into establishing that the Public Debt Department was facing a difficulty in raising the required funding on the February 27,2015, to which de Silva said, de Livera is feeding information to the witness.
The argument went on as de Livera told de Silva to get into the dock to which the latter said he will and asked when should he do so. Justice Jayawardena told both lawyers to stop this drama and proceed with questioning, since the argument was ridiculous.
Meanwhile, Fernando answered in the affirmative when asked whether there was an absence of a proper standard adopted by the Public Debt Department (PDD) to decide on the changes that could be imposed upon the market rates with regards to issuing direct placements. Justice P.S. Jayawardena pointed out that the understanding was that the PDD is only allowed to make changes to the market rate either 5 basis points higher or lower. According to evidence given by Fernando, the PDD could change the market rates by 50 basis points higher or lower. It was also pointed out the direct placements have been issued prior to 2015, where the change of basis points has gone up to a 500 basis points.
Asked on the questioned Treasury bond auction held on February 27, 2015, Fernando said she did not expect the bid rates would go very high. She also said that she found it strange when former Governor Mahendran walked into the Public Debt Department and instructed to take the 20 billion bids that have been received for the questioned auction. Asked as to why she found the directive strange, Fernando said she found it strange because among those bids, there were dummy bids as well. A witness from the Primary Dealer Capital Alliance is to testify before the Commission today (04).

The GMOA Spokesperson claimed that the press releas issued by the Secretary to the President contradicts with the decisions made by President Maithripala Sirisena at the meeting with the GMOA.
President Sirisena made favourable decisions regarding SAITM but Health Minister Rajitha Senarathne messed it up. We had an official and open discussion with the President,Dr.De Soysa said. Dr.Soysa further said that the Secretary to the President was not present at the meeting and added that an indefinite strike is on the cards if the government does not provide a positive response to their demands.
We will continue to protest against SAITM until our demands are met by the government but it is the politicians that support SAITM who often come up with their own solutions,he said.
Dr.Samantha Ananda said that the SAITM issue has become a national issue now and stressed that immediate measures need to be taken whilst ensuring that no injustice is done to the other medical students.
He said that a meeting with district level organisations will be held to create awareness among people and added that the way in which the GMOA intends to launch the strike would be informed in 24 hours.

East Container Terminal delay has cost SLPA Rs 4 bn - Minister
The Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) during the last two years has lost approximately Rs.4 billion due to the delay in completing the East Container Terminal (ECT), Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
However, SLPA is to come up with an ambitious plan to develop and market the Colombo port whilst taking necessary arrangements to fast track the delayed development work on ECT.
This is the money that could have been earned by the Ports Authority easily. It is a shame that we have wasted two years in not developing the East terminal. As you know the previous government went through a tender process and Cabinet approval was also received.
It was a question of implementing it. When this government came into power it was put on hold; we were not able to start the development that was needed so that the East Terminal could be made use of.
Im the minister responsible and as such I will always express my point of view. Finally it is up to the government and the Cabinet ministers to take a collective decision. I have instructed the SLPA Chairman and the Board to give thought to this and come up with a strategy giving priority for this development of the East Terminal, Samarasinghe said.
In addition, planned have been made to embark on a comprehensive national maritime policy to regularize industry activities and to address the key issues that hamper the industry growth to a greater level.
Moreover, SLPA is in the process of drafting a National Port Master Plan.

Education: key to unlock freedom
Many understand education as a process of imparting instructions in various academic disciplines in schools, universities and other institutes of higher learning. But not only in modern society but from ages past education has been rightly understood as a wholesome life-long process of learning and imbibing all that one needs to pick up and absorb to live responsibly and contentedly in the community.
And there are obviously many ways and means of teaching and learning and processing young and maturing people to help them grow to adulthood to be conscientious and responsible human beings.
The clear and higher enlightenment that should come from the depths of religions should indeed raise human beings to elevated and nobler levels of life in the community. It is the function of religions to lead their adherents to higher and such nobler levels of living in solidarity and human fraternity and not leave them floating and drifting in superficial and mundane inanities. To so indulge in religion would be to denigrate religion itself and create an unhealthy dark environment and open the way to chaos and confusion in human society.
As we go through some of these phases of chaos and confusion in our society today, the political and religious leaders should open their eyes to the reality before them and acknowledge that there is ignorance on the part of the mass of people of the core values of religions and that their thoughtless spiritual impoverishment has been influencing them.
VALUE OF GOOD UPBRINGING
In the regeneration of society, elevating the level of education of all the people is of prime importance. This cannot be done unless some basic principles of life have been inculcated in the citizens during their home upbringing and school education during their early years of life as children. Not only good quality schools with good teachers, very good quality homes with responsible parents are necessary for a Nation to be healthy in mind, body and community spirit. Just as governments should be concerned about the policies and quality of school education, it should be equally concerned about the quality of married and family life that provides the background for the nurturing of children, the youngest citizens of the country whose healthy and wholesome upbringing is of crucial social importance.
Who could approve of the behaviour of university students who barged into the Ministry of Health, fought with the police and security forces, injured them and got injured themselves While we shouldn't sneer at the young men, it should also be asked as to who their guides were who led them to such a pass. Who could approve of the doctors who were reluctant to treat the injured in the hospital Their attitude shows that they are uneducated as to the intrinsic worth of every human being. They are all products of defective upbringing in deficient homes and very probably undisciplined and flawed education under uncaring teachers in schools with substandard ethos. Who could approve of the cowardly conspiratorial political ghostly figures who manipulate students and others as their cats paws to do their bidding, leave the sick uncared, cause confusion in the community and embarrass the government and do it all with apparent ulterior motives
It is in the home and school that a child learns the first lessons of responsibility for oneself and for others. A child that does not learn to obey, honour and respect ones father and mother, elders in the family and the neighbourhood and teachers do not learn the most important lesson of life which is to trust and defer to better knowledge and wisdom and submit to parental guidance and legitimate authority. Very clearly, many in the younger generation of today, as well as grown ups who have demonstrated immature and irresponsible attitudes as those in the GMOA, Principals and Teachers and other Trade Unions and in Parliament itself, are clear specimens of flawed home upbringing, school training and defective religious formation. Whence have come all these learned peoples attitudes Whither has their education brought them to To force everyone to accept their opinion and enslave everyone to their way of thinking and acting mercilessly and inhumanly
FIVE-YEAR OLDS DREAM
In good homes and good schools, children from their young days learn wholesome personal and social attitudes. Many adults are not conscious that there are in our homes children of less than five years of age who attend pre-schools who show a keen sense of responsibility for oneself and for others. They become remarkable so when they are so taught by parents and teachers. The weekly newspaper Catholic Messenger of June 25, 2017 publishes a story of a five-year-old girl who inspired by what a four-year-old girl had done, felt sympathy for malnourished children and helped raise 20,000 dollars in Hong Kong in two weeks and who says, My dream is to help more poor people.
I myself have met a four-year-old girl who after the birth of her baby sister told me, Father, now I have to be responsible and give a good example to my little sister! There are many such children in our midst, in our homes and schools. They are children of good and responsible parents. Proper nurturing and preparation will motivate them to be very responsible adult citizens.
Those who are close to children in our schools know that a good many of them are indeed upright and virtuous. Parents and teachers should be able to pay careful attention to them and help them to build up their will and character as they grow in intelligence and acquire various skills and help them to grow to that adult maturity of responsible citizens who would be invaluable and great assets to the country. From the palpable environment of their home and school, they imbibe the ethos feasible to community living in responsibility.
It is up to government authorities to see that badly brought up and defectively educated individuals do not cause destruction and damage to people and property and disrupt good relations in the community.
LONG-LASTING INJURIES
It has to be admitted that all children do not get the care, attention and protection they need. It is a great social tragedy that not all parents, school teachers, elders, guardians not only do not take proper care of children at home and school, they neglect them and leave them uncared, to be on their own even at a very young age; they also through ignorance and lack of preparation ill-treat and hurt children and even punish them inappropriately and mercilessly, venting unrestrained anger and ill-temper on them. Some couples living together and bringing forth children, some parents, teachers and guardians in homes and orphanages have never been in any way prepared to handle and care for children nor have they by themselves acquired the capacity and skill to provide tender loving care that children need. Due to this failing on their part long-lasting physical injuries and psychological damage are caused to innocent children. It is heartbreaking to see that some religious persons too have abused children. Religious institutions have therefore been compelled to enforce zero tolerance of child abuse.
As prevention is better than cure, the government agencies of child welfare and protection could do much to raise the consciousness of the people in general and certain sectors in particular to aspects of child care many do not think about.
HONEST OFFICIALS PERSECUTED
The qualities that are glaringly lacking in the many agencies of public service of government are skill, enthusiasm, stimulus and motivation. Almost all government agencies of public service are overpopulated with political lackeys of incompetent and stupid politicians who have made the public service a channel to provide employment to their unemployed supporters who have also remained so in their frustrated situation due to lack of skills and training and the incomplete education they have received from an education system directed, controlled, influenced and administered by incompetent politicians who should never have been in the positions of power they hold. Politicisation by corrupt politicians has led many a government service into inextricably messy, fraudulent and freakish institutional caprice from which people cannot expect honest service. The people often hear of honest officials being transferred, persecuted and gunned down due to their not toeing the line of corrupt politicians in power.
If the people want a truly honest and honourable progeny of theirs to grow in an environment of truth, justice and freedom where merit and competence are valued by highly trained and qualified experts tried in the crucible of unrelenting hard work, they should become truthful, just and honest themselves. Then they should make a determined and decisive effort to get rid of the horde of hoodlum political crooks on the national stage who have taken to politics to embezzle, commit fraud and pilfer the peoples wealth and are a despicable ruffian lot ruining this land posing as nationalist patriots so well exemplified in the partners of the last regime.

Fifty two years ago, when Ananda won after 26 years
Dear readers I landed in Melbourne just a few days back and its freezing cold but ideal surroundings to continue with my series of articles which is a privilege and a pleasure.
Ananda Sumanadasa wrote a detailed write up on this particular match, a few years back in America. He is domiciled there for a long time. Ananda got his degree from The Cambridge University in England, he worked as a consultant engineer and is retired now. He was Anandas solid opening batsman during that era. Sumandasa gave a vivid description of this match a few years back.
Ananda College was captained by that dashing opener A.G.Perera and yours truly was the vice-captain of that side. Interestingly both captain and the vice-captain ended up as Chartered Engineers in later life.
As is the tradition the match was played at the Colombo Oval on March 19 and 20th in 1965.Sumanadasa stated that Ananda won the toss and elected to bat on a wicket that looked full of runs. The players were greeted by two experienced umpires Lucky Mayo and Harmer as they descended on to the playing arena. Nalanda opened with their two left arm paceman Anura De Silva and A.Ponamperuma, both bowled round the wicket inswingers as their stock balls. Our opening batsmen A, Sumanadasa and A.G.Perera started soundly and the later in typical style belting a couple of fours all of a sudden , with the score at 19 , A.G. fell to a full blooded pull shot smartly taken by Amaraweera who flung himself to his left. Then three more batsmen Late Lakshman de Silva , Sumanadasa and Duminda Siriwardene were back in the pavilion within a space of half an hour.
The ideal batting wicket played as expected stated Sumanadasa, it was the dismal batting by the Anandians which surprised all, they struggled at 28 for 4. The early damage was done by Ponnamperuma , Vas Gunawardene and Anura De Silva. At that stage Ananda pinned their hopes on left hander G.C.Perera and Tilak De Silva, who hit a century against St Benedicts the previous year. Rescue they did. These two batsmen batted with purpose and sound judgement, and punished the loose balls and moved the score to 91 for 4 by Lunch.
After the resumption Tilak De Silva went for 25 caught behind by late Wasantha Senewiratne and the partnership of 70 runs concluded. As it happens another collapse occurred and G.C.Perere ran out of partners and got out for 57 well compiled runs, battled for 2 hours, his innings was studded with pleasing drives and well timed pull shots which grazed the mid-wicket boundary. The tail did not wag and the innings folded up at 122. If not for the Perera -De silva partnership Ananda would have been in dire straits, this was invaluable since it was made between two major collapses. The Nalanda bowlers Vas Gunewardene bagging 4 for 25 and Shantha Pieris scalping 3 for 29 kept a tight leash on the Anandians to contain them for a mediocre total of 122, the brilliant fielding of the Nalandians helped their cause.
Nalanda opened in a business-like fashion Shantha Pieris scoring all-round the Oval, rookie Laxman Doolwela, just 14 years of age and still wet behind the years, ably supported his free scoring partner. There were no threats offered by the Ananda bowlers, till Lalith Gunaratne was brought into the attack, Laliths gentle in dippers got Pieris caught behind by Ivan Amaranayake. According to Sumanadasa this was the turning point of the match, he further added that all this drama on the first day was missed by Dhanasiri Weerasinghe who was on election duty due to the prevailing General Election.
At 45 for 1, A.G.Perera threw caution to the wind, and against the coaches instruction started bowling, he caused havoc capturing 3 wickets in 5 balls with his medium pace seamers, Cholmondeley Amarasekera ,Anura De Silva and late Wasntha Senewiratne were his victims. At the tea break Nalanda were 52 for 4.
Sumandasa stated that after tea Jayawardene with a couple of hits to the boundary tried to resurrect the innings but got out with the score at 65 for 5. Doolwela the back bone of the innings was joined by Gunawardene both being freshers put on a brave partnership and took the total past the 100 mark, the latter bating aggressively, as Nalanda looked like gaining the upper hand, Gunawardene got out trying to sweep Siriwardene and was adjudged lbw, score was 111.
In the gathering darkness, the stubborn Doolewla was joined by Mahinda Wijesekera with half an hour to go. Confusion set in and this pair trying to push the score along were both run out. Doolwelas vigil came to an end after 3 hours and scored 37 precious runs. A.G.Perera came back in to the attack and polished off the tail, Nalanda all out for 138 giving them a slender lead of 16 runs.
Sumanadasa stated that at the end of the first day, Nalanda could breathe a sigh of relief by restricting the stronger Anandians to a paltry score and outscored their opponents by a small margin. He adds that fortunately they were unable to drive home the early advantage with a significant score.
The match was left on a knife edge since it could have gone either way the following day.
A.G. Pererera with his cutters, seam and swing ripped through the Nalandians, he was cheeky enough to go against the grain defying the coachs orders not to bowl. His calculated gamble finally paid off. Doolwela at the raw age of 14 years batted like a veteran to glue the Nalanda innings together, I saw with my own eyes standing at slip his concentration! it was not second to a Sunil Gavaskar.
I was also proud enough to have that small partnership with the elegant left hander G.C.Perera, which really boosted our score.

Freedom to scratch..!
For the last few days the heat has been terrible in the city, so hot, that sometimes I see sizzling waves rising from the ground, ready to oppress, ready to clamp and engulf with torridness, all those it can encompass within its sweaty grasp. But worse than we humans, its animals who suffer most.
But my dog prefers the heat, than coming into my air-conditioned room from where I write. Not that he isnt reacting to the heat, he is. I know he finds it unbearable, and walks all over the house looking dejected and depressed, but try as I may, he wont enter my comfortable room. Now why would a dog not what to enjoy the coolness of an AC room Why does he want to lie in the humidity and oppressive heat outside, when luxury awaits him inside
Well, the reason, is he isnt allowed to scratch himself in my room. All dogs love to scratch. Some sit, some stand, some even walk while doing so, and if you ever look at their faces, thats one simple pleasure they enjoy: The joy of scratching!
Ah the pleasure they get from that one scratch which goes on quite often for a few minutes. No, we do bathe him, shampoo him, brush him, and even see his skin is not dry, but his scratching is his source of pleasure. Unfortunately, that very process creates problems in my room, as his fur and hair land up all over my bed and chair and table and soon I start scratching either because its contagious or hes sent a tick flying in my direction!
So I dont let him scratch in my room, and because hes not allowed to do so, he would rather stay out in the sweltering heat, happy his scratching isnt restricted or curbed by anyone.
But is this freedom to scratch limited only to dogs Very often Ive seen luxurious homes, where sons and daughters have everything money can buy, except they have an authoritarian father or possessive mother. And one fine day, they find their child either hanging from the end of a rope or running away, or getting into wrong company and bad habits. We gave him everything! the parents cry.
Yes, but you didnt give him or her, the right to scratch. Some freedom. Some lifting of rules!
Sometimes in a country, a prime minister rules. He promises people progress, and upliftment, but takes away their press freedom, bans beef, bans money transactions and curbs their right to protest. Its just a matter of time before people reject him! Or it could be a friend. A boyfriend or a girl you are friendly with! Do you give them space A time to be themselves
I open my door and watch my dog lying outside. The heat is terrible, but there seems to be a grin on his face, and I know, hes just had a good, long scratch..!

Full-scale investigation ordered
The Anuradhapura Police Traffic Division has been directed by Anuradhapura ASP Chulani C. Weeraratne to conduct a full-scale investigation into an accident involving a double cab allegedly driven by a son of Anuradhapura District Parliamentarian and former Minister S.M. Chandrasena causing serious injuries to a 60-year-old motorcyclist around noon on July 2.

A full-scale squashy war against the mossie posse
Readers have come to know me, I hope, as a kind, live-and-let-live sort who wouldnt hurt a soul. I know for sure that they dont view me as a pathological killer. But thats a false presumption. I now confess to my homicidal ways  the slapping and gassing  and the evil sneer on my face as I smash my enemy into oblivion.
Readers know my enemy. Its that blasted, bloodsucking creature we call the mosquito. Most you imagine that the pestiferous mosquitoes are fly-by-night creatures which emerge from their hell-hoes when the sun goes down. But there are exceptions such as the Aedes Aegypti which is a day biting mosquito. That means that the varmints are most active during daylight, for approximately two hours after sunrise and several hours before sunset. These parasitic pesquitos spread the deadly Dengue fever, Chikungunya, Yellow fever West Nile Virus and Eastern Equine Encephalitis - not to forget the illness and death of past plagues such as Malaria.
Yet both night and day-biters have just two things on their tiny minds - food and sex. Mosquitos can impress potential mates by harmonizing the high-pitched whine of their tiny wings. Now, scientists have discovered how this musical matchmaking helps the insects to pick their perfect partner.
Unfortunately the preferred meal of the female mosquito is blood, and that's where the problems between us and these blasted bugs begin. Yes, I did read somewhere that those infernal mosquitoes have killed more humans on earth than wars. They are the worst creatures on earth, beside humans. If you think you're too small to make a difference, you haven't spent a night with a mosquito. I know one thing for sure and that is that their life sucks. I dont mind that so much as long as they dont suck my life blood. My obese friend Sal keeps asking me why they cant suck fat instead of blood.
Okay, fine, so entomologists tell us that mosquito larvae provide nourishment for fish. Then I say we should dry the pesky little buggers into flaked fish food. Every last one of them, stuffed in cardboard shakers. That would work for me. Nope, I dont buy any justification for the most annoying creature in the universe. They may be small but are deadly especially if a disease spreader gets under your skin. Did you know there are thousands of species of mosquitoes all over the world The Antarctica is the only continent on the globe that doesnt have a mosquito problem. And, worldwide, we have only been able to control them partially. But the problem is that we cant completely eradicate them.
If they were bigger or I was smaller Id wring their wiry little necks like a chickens if I could. I've also resorted to using a big, industrial fan at the back door, mosquito foggers and those candles in buckets that guarantee to suffocate any mosquito that dares to approach. Maybe all this works. I couldnt say because I did find some dead mosquitoes in the dogs water bowl. But the robust ones were holding a prayer meeting around the rim of the candle bucket. I guess they must have liked the ambience.
Actually, its the female mosquito that does the damage. According to research on average, a female will live 2-3 weeks, but the males lifespan is shorter. Within their lifetime both adult male and female will feed on nectar and plant fluids, but it is only the female that will seek a blood meal. Upon locating a suitable host, the female probes the skin for a blood capillary and then injects a small amount of saliva containing chemicals, which prevent the hosts blood from clotting.
After engorging on the hosts blood, the female will find a resting place to digest her meal and develop eggs before flying off to deposit them in a suitable aquatic habitat. The darn hussy! And sure enough their religion is blood. If they could talk these mossies will call you an atheist if you say Dracula doesnt exist. But I for one wont stand for some female blood sucker drawing my blood and trying to make her getaway with buzzing lyrics that go: Yummy, yummy, yummy, I've got blood in my tummy. I spend an hour chasing the damn thing around my room and return only when I have blood on my hands.
And talk about their promiscuous sex techniques. Turns out, at least for these darned skeeters, as the Yanks call them, sex is an acrobatic, mid-air event  the flaming aerial exhibitionists! Surely, they can display a shameless flaunting of the dalliance that would have given the expert Kama Sutra exponents an inferiority complex with their high-flying jiggery-pokery. I agree with writer Alexis Arguello who said, When you see a mosquito and youre able to hit it, youre able to hit it with a couple of short, sharp shots its a beautiful thing. Actually for the majority of us its a great feeling being slap-happy around them and reducing them to bloody pulp, either by chance or sheer skill.
And naturally theres no better feeling of double joy than swatting them when they are engaged in the process of procreation. It certainly is therapeutic when you start slapping and slashing at the fused couple and liquidate them both with a single thunderous handclap.
And could any theologian explain why the heck old Noah didnt kill his only pair of mossies Ill bet it was because they kept breeding faster than any other genus in the great deluge and came back to bite every living species on the Ark. The male is not totally innocent though. He has romanced the female, which sends her buzzing off on her Dracularian search. So, hey, if you happen to hear a mosquito buzzing around your ear at night dont buzz back. Just do what I do. Kill em dead!
But the pestilential mossie does come in handy when it comes to dealing with certain unbearable humans and can be a pretty good scapegoat to boot when you want to slap someone. All you have to do is slap him hard on the cheek. Then before he could protest yell: Mosquito!

Geriatric Care Nurses to get training in Germany
Foreign Employment Ministry Secretary G.S. Withanage and the 2017-2018 GFMD German Co-Chairmanship Ambassador Dr. Gtz Schmidt-Bremme, signed a Joint Declaration of Intent on principles of fair recruitment of personnel for training as geriatric nurses in Germany.
The signing ceremony took place at the German Federal Foreign Ministry in Berlin, during Secretary Withanges visit to Berlin, leading the Sri Lanka government delegation to the 10th meeting of the Global Forum on Migration and Development (GFMD) hosted by the German government.
Ambassador Schmidt-Bremme, expressing his satisfaction that the agreement could be concluded following a brief consultation, said, it was a sign of enhanced cooperation for the future.
Thanking the Government of Germany for providing the opportunity for the Sri Lankan health sector's professionals to work and live in Germany through this programme, Withanage said, it will be a win-win situation for both countries and will be a path to further strengthen the relations between the two countries.
The Agreement envisages training to commence in Sri Lanka from 2018 and the trainees will be provided with a comprehensive German language training (B2 level) and the professional training in the geriatric care on par with the requisite standards in Germany with the assurance of working and integrating in Germany.
The Embassy of Sri Lanka in Berlin and the Permanent Mission in Geneva coordinated with the Foreign Employment Ministry in getting this agreement off the ground from an initial stalemate due to the pressing priorities faced by Germany due to the European migration crisis.
Sri Lankan Ambassador to Berlin Karunatilake Amunugama, the Sri Lankan Deputy Permanent Representative to UN in Geneva Samantha Jaysuriya, Sri Lankan Foreign Employment Bureau General Manager Devseth Fernando, Additional General Manager (International Affairs) W.M. Wansekera, and the Third Secretary of the Sri Lanka Embassy in Berlin Gamini Wijayarathna joined the event.
Senior officials of the Federal Foreign Office joined Immigration Law and Migration Policy Officer Sebastian Damm, Migration Issues, Global Forum on Migration and Development Senior Policy Advisor Katharina Bosch and South Asian Division First Counsellor Dr. Gerhard Almer were present.

GW Hotels to invest over  Rs 2.5 bn in Unavatuna
The newly formed GW Hotels Group, in Unavatuna, Galle, will invest over Rs. 2.5 billion for four leisure sector projects in the area.
Chairman Gamini Wickramarachchi said that their first venture was Rock Fort Hotel & Spa, a luxury hotel on the Unawatuna Beach. This hotel which opened two years ago has 20 luxury rooms including four suites, a spa, restaurant, bar, pool and two banquet halls and a rooftop restaurant.
He said that the hotel is maintaining high occupancy and they cannot cope up with the demand during the season. Our main market is France, the UK and Germany and we are also witnessing increase bookings from China and Russia. This is why we decided to venture in a second hotel, Rock Fort Pearl, right opposite our hotel. Here we offer additional 10 rooms mainly targetting both local and foreign budget travelers. In a bid to increase more facilities, we will soon introduce a swimming pool to this hotel and more facilities.
He said that they invested nearly Rs. 1 billion for these two hotels.
Having started business as a leading metal crusher and provider of earth movers in 1983, he diversified to the leisure sector mainly due to his passion for tourism and also to provide employment for youth.
Today, we have provided over 100 employment opportunities and will offer further 125 placements from our next two projects.
He said they have now acquired another demolished beach hotel in Thalpe to build a more luxurious hotel targetting the high-end client. We will completely demolish this hotel and build 35 chalets with individual jacuzzis in some rooms at this property.
He said that they will start construction of the new hotel in mid August and the hotel is to be completed in two years.
Executive Chef Lakmal Mudalige
Group General Manager Deepthi Hettiarachchi said that with the opening of the highway, the hotels host many corporate events, mainly from Colombo and Matara and Galle, as well as weddings. Due to high quality of service and our food and beverage menus, we are getting increasing bookings from the MICE sector.
Hence, the GW Hotels Group is looking at building one of the biggest banquets halls in the area which could accommodate 1,000 guests. We will also have 30 rooms and a swimming pool to offer a comprehensive package for guests using our MICE facilities.
The Group, taking another step forward, also launched its website to increase web bookings which is the future mode of bookings. He also said that they are currently offering over 30% discounts for special card promotions for Sri Lankan guests. (SS)

Htota port deal with transparency soon - Minister
Newly appointed Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe says he has taken over negotiations pertaining to Hambantota port development deal with China Merchants to his hand.
The minister expressed hope that both parties will come to a consensus which would ultimately create a win-win situation for the both parties. Earlier so many parties were involved in negotiating the deal on behalf of the government, while several contrary cabinet papers were presented to the parliament. This sent a very wrong signal to the international community.
He made these comments speaking at the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Leaders evening 2017 held in Colombo. According to the minister, he has already consulted his colleagues including Ministers Malik Samarawickrama, Arjuna Ranathunga and Sarath Amunugama, who have been involved in this process previously.
We are working as a team, but I have taken negotiations to my hand, he said.
Samarasinghe expressed hope that Sri Lanka would be able to put in place an eventual agreement that will not compromise the national interest of the country.
We have had several rounds of discussions with China Merchant Port. Ports Authority Chairman Dissanayake also had several discussions. He has spent hours and hours in discussing the nitty-grittys of the agreement. Security aspects will not be comprised in any way, meaning that the navy will discharge their mandate and the ports authority will discharge their mandate .The Sri Lanka Ports Authority Act will not be amended to suit the particular situation.
The draft will be shared with the President and the Prime Minister. The President has already outlined his concerns. Once it is approved by the ministers in parliament, it will be signed. There will be transparency. It is facing a lot of controversy, so I want to place the agreement before the parliament, so it becomes a public document.
The public will see whats in the agreement; nothing should be hidden, the minister said.
SL Ports Authority burdened with servicing Htota port loans
Minister Samarasinghe also claimed that Sri Lanka Ports Authority had to spend its own generated funds amounting to US $ 175 million in servicing loans, obtained to build the Hambantota port.
Serving of loans has been entirely shouldered by SLPA, not the treasury.
If this strategic partnership is put into place, the minister hopes that all that money will be saved and could be used for the development of Jaya Terminal, as well as the East Terminal depending on the load factor.
SLPA is also seriously looking to develop the West Terminal, however, according to the minister that decision will have to be taken in the context of load factor.

Holder inspires Windies to stunning victory
North Sound: West Indies captain Jason Holder led from the front with a five-wicket haul as his side snatched an 11-run win over India in the fourth one-day international in Antigua on Sunday.
India came into the match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium leading 2-0 in the series and set a modest target of 190 to maintain their unbeaten run in this short campaign.
But the visitors were undone by a combination of disciplined West Indies bowling and their own inexplicable lethargy at the crease.
That pedestrian progress was typified by Mahendra Singh Dhoni's painstaking innings of 54 off 114 deliveries - the slowest of his 64 ODI half-centuries - before he fell off the last ball of the 49th over bowled by Kesrick Williams.
That left India needing 15 runs off the final over with only two wickets in hand.
It was Williams' only success of a miserly 10-over spell but proved critical as Holder sealed the win which keeps the series alive heading into the fifth and final match in Kingston on Thursday.
He dismissed Kuldeep Yadav and Mohammed Shami in the space of four balls to finish with five for 27, his best-ever ODI figures as India folded for 178.
"At the halfway stage there were a few heads dropping in the dressing room but it took a big effort and I'm really pleased to play a part in keeping us in the series," said Holder after receiving the man of the match award.
"We targeted getting wickets at the front to challenge their other batters who haven't had much work to do of late. It worked this time."
Ajinkya Rahane's excellent form at the top of the order continued with a top score of 60, but the rest of the Indian batting struggled to establish any sort of momentum as the West Indies showed discipline and purpose with the ball.
Young fast bowler Alzarri Joseph, brought into the team in place of medium-pacer Miguel Cummins, set the tone for the fightback with the wickets of Shikhar Dhawan and Dinesh Karthik.
Meanwhile, Holder removed his Indian counterpart, Virat Kohli, for the second time in as many matches via a top-edged hook.
"Our shot selection wasn't up to mark but credit to the West Indies bowlers for the pressure they put on us to force those mistakes," said Kohli in assessing his team's surprise defeat.
"I am sure the guys are going to come back extra hard for the final match. We just needed a complete performance and today wasn't one."
Ealier, pacers Umesh Yadav and Hardik Pandya claimed three wickets each while wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav again teased and tormented the West Indies batsmen in adding two more victims to his series haul as the hosts limped to 189 for nine batting first.
While each of the top five managed to get a start, none could get past 35 as India exerted almost complete control over a line-up that lacked the inspirational spark to put the opposition under pressure.
Openers Evin Lewis and Kyle Hope were the joint top scorers with 35 apiece although their slow progress - the opening stand of 57 was broken in the 18th over - meant those who followed were required to pick up the pace.
None managed to do so for any sustained period with Pandya and Kuldeep doing the bulk of the damage to the West Indies batting line-up early on.
Umesh then ensured there was to be no threat from the reputed lower-order big-hitters as he accounted for Holder, Rovman Powell and Ashley Nurse in his second spell.
India had rung the changes for this match with Karthik replacing Yuvraj Singh in the middle-order, Ravindra Jadeja coming in as a specialist spinner for Ravichandran Ashwin and Shami making his first ODI appearance since the 2015 World Cup as Bhuvneshwar Kumar was rested. AFP

HPV vaccination for all Sri Lankan women by 2018: Health Minister
The government does not do calculations by rupees and cents when it comes to health and education. Therefore, the Health Ministry is ready to provide free vaccination against HPV for all Sri Lankan women by next year, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the gathering after launching the vaccination against HPV for Grade six schoolgirls during a ceremony held at the BMICH in Colombo yesterday.
The minister said the money would be allocated through the Finance Ministry when the health officials formulated the programme. He requested health officials to formulate the plan to implement the programme and hand it over to him by the end of this year.
Minister Senaratne said that between 850 and 1,000 cervical cancer patients are detected in Sri Lanka annually and it can be prevented through the vaccination..
The coverage of the Sri Lankas National Immunity Programme is 100 percent. Even the late Prebhakaran gave a two-day ceasefire to carry out immunization programme in the North and East during the war. The refugees arrived from the LTTE held areas had the immunization cards of their children with them even they did not have their birth certificates.
Sri Lanka commenced a proper immunization programme in 1978, he said. Minister Senaratne said it will take some more time to use the French dengue vaccine in Sri Lanka because some issues there to be sorted out in the age groups. Now the Philippines are in the programme.
The French Ambassador held discussions with me about the delay, he said.

I knew I wasn't fit enough, says Kyrgios after Wimbledon woe
London: Nick Kyrgios revealed he knew he wasn't fit enough to play Wimbledon after being forced to retire from his first round match against Pierre-Hugues Herbert on Monday.
Kyrgios has been struggling to recover from the left hip injury that forced him to pull out of Queen's Club last month and he was advised by a doctor not to compete at Wimbledon.
But the 22-year-old had reached at least the fourth round in all three of his previous Wimbledon appearances and wanted to give it a shot at his favourite Grand Slam. After losing in the second round at both the Australian and French Opens this year, Kyrgios's miserable 2017 continued as the world number 20 lost the first two sets 6-3, 6-4 against Herbert before deciding to call it quits due to the nagging injury.
"I kind of knew I was in trouble. I have been feeling my hip ever since I fell over at Queen's," Kyrgios said.
"Never got it right. I was doing everything I could to help it, but just not enough time. Yeah, I mean, I just wasn't 100 percent.
"I spoke to the doctor before the tournament started. He was leaning towards me not even playing.
"It's my favourite tournament. I do well here every year. So it's tough for me to go out there and pull out. It's not the easiest thing for me to do."
Kyrgios, then ranked 144th, burst onto the scene at Wimbledon in 2014 when he defeated then world number one Rafael Nadal en route to the quarter-finals. But from the moment he stepped onto Court Three wearing long white leggings under his shorts, Kyrgios didn't look comfortable.
"I thought I could win. Obviously probably not against him, but some opponents if I played them today, I probably still could have won," he said.
"I could feel the hip a lot. It was hindering my performance a lot.
"My preparation wasn't great. I knew I was hurting.
"I played a couple practice matches at Boodles. I wasn't going very hard. I knew I was going to struggle."
Kyrgios would prefer not to undergo surgery, but is likely to have a scan this week to determine whether the hip has been aggravated by his decision to play Wimbledon.
"Probably get an MRI tomorrow. Hopefully get an injection or something, do rehab, and get healthy," Kyrgios said.
"I don't think anyone wants to go down the surgery route. I would do everything possible to avoid it.
"I mean, I'm obviously a little bit scared. But I don't think I need it at the moment."
Herbert will face French compatriot Benoit Paire for a place in the third round.

ICC Womens World Cup 2017 : Australia and India edge closer to securing semi-final spots
Defending champion Australia and India overpowered New Zealand and Pakistan respectively in the matches between the neighbours to register their third successive victories in the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 on Sunday.
Australia spoiled Suzie Batess 100th ODI by reaching the 220-run target in the penultimate over for the loss of five wickets in Bristol, while India overcame a watchful and cautious batting display to successfully defend a modest score of 169 for nine by bowling Pakistan out for 74 to win by 95 runs in Derby.
Elsewhere, England coasted to a comfortable seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka when it chased down a 205-run target with more than 19 overs to spare in Taunton, while South Africa dismissed the West Indies for 48 - the 17thlowest score in the history of womens ODIs  before overhauling the target inside seven overs with all 10 wickets intact in Leicester
After round three of seven, Australia and India are the only unbeaten sides in the tournament, while England and South Africa have won two matches apiece. New Zealand is sitting on one victory whereas Pakistan, Sri Lanka and the West Indies are still searching for their maiden wins.
Australias remaining matches are against Pakistan (5 July, Leicester), England (9 July, Bristol), India (12 July, Bristol) and South Africa (15 July, Taunton), while India has to play Sri Lanka (5 July, Derby), South Africa (8 July, Leicester), Australia (12 July, Bristol) and New Zealand (15 July, Derby). If both the sides can manage a couple of more wins each, then they will be guaranteed spots in the semi-finals, irrespective of how the other matches in the group stage pan out
As far as England is concerned, it too remains one of the favourites to progress to the last four stage as its remaining matches are against South Africa (5 July, Bristol), Australia (9 July, Bristol), New Zealand (12 July, Derby) and West Indies (15 July, Derby), while either New Zealand or South Africa is expected to complete the semi-final line-up.
Bowlers dominated day seven of the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 with Indias Ekta Bisht turning out to be the pick with figures of 10-2-18-5. South Africa captain Dane van Niekerk recorded figures of 3.2-3-0-4, her team-mate Marizanne Kapp finished with analysis of 7-2-14-4, Englands Laura Marsh finished with 10-0-45-4 and Nashra Sandhu of Pakistans ended up with figures of 10-1-26-4.

Kang makes first LPGA title a major with Womens PGA win
CHICAGO: American Danielle Kang birdied the par-5 18th hole Sunday to edge defending champion Brooke Henderson and win the Womens PGA Championship, making her first LPGA triumph a major victory.
Kang, who never managed a top-10 finish in 30 prior major starts, fired a three-under par 68 to finish 72 holes at Olympia Fields near Chicago on 13-under 271, edging Canadian teen star Henderson by one stroke.
I feel fantastic, absolutely fantastic, Kang said. Having a major win, its amazing. She was the first winner since Meg Mallon in 1991 to birdie the last hole for the triumph.
It feels pretty awesome, Kang said. That was the hardest two-footer Ive ever had to putt. I had to tell myself, You dont miss 2-footers so just putt it. It was pretty nerve-wracking but I just did it. South Koreans took the next four spots with Chella Choi third on 274 after a closing 71. Lee Mi-Hyang, Amy Yang and Kim Sei-Young shared fourth on 275 with South Korean Park In-Bee and American Lexi Thompson sharing seventh on 277. Kang, a 24-year-old from San Francisco, is a two-time US Womens Amateur champion whose best prior LPGA finish had been a third-place effort in 2013. Her best major showing had been a share of 14th at the 2012 US Womens Open.
It was stressful, Kang said. Every single shot was stressful. Every putt was stressful. I just kept trusting in my own game and trusting in my putting. Its all about believing in what you can do. After a birdie at the par-4 second, Kang took a bogey at the third, then began the back nine with another bogey.
But from there she ran off four birdies in a row starting at the par-4 11th to seize a three-stroke lead on 13-under.
Henderson, a 19-year-old coming off a victory two weeks ago at the Meijer LPGA Classic, birdied the par-5 first and par-3 fourth and seventh holes to reach 10-under, then stayed steady with nine consecutive birdies.
Three down with two holes to play, Henderson closed with back-to-back birdies at the par-3 17th and had an eagle putt stop rolling just short of the cup at 18 to finish on 272.
Kang, meanwhile, took a bogey at 17 to fall back into a tie for the lead, only to finish with a birdie to claim her long-sought first title after playing her first LPGA event in 2011.
I played great all week. Came so close, and it really came down to those last two holes, Henderson said. I would have liked to make one or two more putts on the back nine, but it was a great week for me.
There was a little bit more pressure coming into this week, and knowing that I won last year, I really wanted to do it again. I gave myself the best opportunity to do that, and unfortunately I just came up a little bit short. Choi, also seeking her first major crown, fired a 71 but could not join the title fight at the finish.
The 26-year-old from Daegu won her only LPGA crown at the 2015 Marathon Classic. Her best prior finish in any major was a share of fifth at this event in 2013. AFP

Lions have poked the bear, says Gatland
WELLINGTON: Warren Gatland says his British and Irish Lions poked the bear with their second Test win over the All Blacks and warned against riling up the world champions ahead of this weekends series decider.
But despite advising his players to mind their tongues, the coach could not resist his own dig at the world champions lack of running rugby in the first two Tests.
Ironically, this is the best team in the world and, for two Test matches, they really havent stressed us, he told British media.
They have squeezed us and made us give away penalties but we havent seen the expansive rugby that the All Blacks are known for.
Weve coped with that and, if we can continue to improve in other areas, then we are going to see, hopefully, a great Test match. He expected a strong response from the All Blacks to the Lions 24-21 win over a 14-man New Zealand in Wellington. Yes, we have poked the bear but hopefully the wounded Lion from last week is still recovering as well, he said.
Gatland said his players should watch what they say about their opponents in the build up to the third Test in Auckland on Saturday.
Hopefully we dont give them any ammunition this week and concentrate on ourselves because they will be using anything they can to motivate themselves, he said. AFP

Mending broken relationships
There is no convenient roadmap for reconciliation. There is no short cut or simple prescription for healing the wounds of people in the aftermath of sustained conflict. Creating a trust and understanding between two or more communities that were divided is an extremely difficult challenge. Yet, reconciliation is an essential part of building a lasting peace. Examining the painful memories of the past, acknowledging them, understanding and above all, transcending it together is the best way to guarantee that the conflicts cannot happen again. Reconciliation has only recently been recognized as a necessary component of post-conflict reconstruction. Anyhow, it cannot be a quick fix but requires time and patience, an incremental approach and a capacity to evolve and adapt to challenges and opportunities. In this process of searching for truth, justice forgiveness and healing, the ultimate goal should be lasting peace. Reconciliation does not necessarily mean to love the human once thought of as enemies, or to forgive them and forget the past somehow, but it is more of finding a way to co-exist with them, to develop the necessary cooperation to share the society with them so that people may have a better life together than what they have had separately. While dealing with the issues that divided a nation in the past, it is important to redesign the relationships between communities. If efforts can be taken to address these two parallel processes, there will be a great reward which is eternal peace enabling society to move from a divided past to a shared future.
Overcoming suspicionand distrust
Sri Lanka after experiencing decades of conflict is now progressing in the process of rebuilding and reconciliation. Different parties have been involved with post conflict reconciliation and peace building in Sri Lanka. Despite progressive efforts in rehabilitation, rebuilding, development and establishing social justice, healing the wounds and reconciliation still needs to be addressed and further strengthened.
Many people especially the victims of hurt are suspicious of reconciliation and see it as brushing aside or ignoring their suffering. It is not easy to forget the past and exist as nothing ever happened. First of all, the victims should be freed from the paralysing isolation and self-pity in which they often live in. This involves the building or renewing of communication inside the communities which is a responsibility of political, community and religious leaders and other respective organizations. It also involves the concerned parties to build confidence first in oneself and then in each other in a safe environment. It is also vital to empathise with the feeling of each other. Empathy comes with the victims willingness to listen to the reasons for hatred of those who caused pain and with the understanding of the offenders of the anger and bitterness of those who suffered. It is for this cause that Centre for Peace Building and Reconciliation (CPBR) render their services in a bid to fill the gaps between the communities in Sri Lanka creating the platform for necessary dialogue. CPBR was co-founded in the year 2002 by Professor Jayantha Seneviratne and Dishani Jayaweera, a dynamic Attorney-at-Law who gave up her profession for this noble cause. CPBR has been working with faith leaders from the year 2008 and as an expansion of its interfaith work CPBR has taken steps to set up its sister organization `Woman to work with female religious leaders and interfaith women groups.
Woman, who has the power to create life, intubate and deliver to the world, lifes very nurturing force is called to strive to bring about change and become whatever she wants, growing and developing into the life she chooses while healing the souls of others. `Woman, pursue non-traditional ways to achieve their eternal dream `Heal the Past: Build the future, through healing the body, mind, soul and soil. One of the main initiatives under woman is the Female Inter-Faith Initiative (FIFI) which aims at objectives such as building connections among diverse religious and regional women leaders in order to bridge their communities together, to develop their knowledge and capacities to transform inner, inter, social conflicts through intra faith and interfaith dialogues and actions that builds relationships amongst them to celebrate togetherness and womanhood.
At the recently held symposium on `The Role of Women and Dialogue in Reconciliation witnessed the participation of 200 female religious leaders and 200 woman leaders from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Jaffna, Vauniya, Batticaloa, Galle and Colombo. It also saw the launch of Interfaith Women Religious Circle  IWRC and interfaith Woman Collective IWC to strengthen the current reconciliation process.
Creating safe spacesfor women
With decades old strength and wisdom from our mother organization, Centre for Peace Building and Reconciliation-CPR, we wanted to create a safe space for women of different faiths, ethnicities and religions to share their views and find their inner selves to connect to the world to heal each other. In 2013/14 we started to work with woman religious leaders. Rising Woman initiative was created on behalf of their request, Co-founder CPBR, Dishani Jayaweera said.
Bringing recycling, reconciliation, re-building, re-designing and re-interpreting into one cycle, we have chosen creativity and care for earth as the entering point. We were exploring how we could bring women in gardens, farms, kitchens and factories into political discourse while adding new colour into their lives. Colour of spirituality beyond religion. Colour of self-esteem, self-affirmation and self-care. Colours of compassion, empathy and togetherness. Colours of womanhood and human-hood, she said.
Jayaweera says dialogue for reconciliation has always been involving religious men in our society. Thus, it was high time to create a platform and a safe environment for women to see, read, understand and interpret everything as they experience it. When it came to interfaith dialogues, the religious leaders were always men. Women religious leaders were not able to voice their ideas and opinions. I found that they have the most beautiful ideas and interpretations and they are so humane. I as a secular person saw the need of space for women religious leaders to explore ways to first understand and heal themselves and then heal one another and all living human beings while embracing the identity of our womanhood, she said.
In Sri Lanka, 73 to 76 percent are religious. Religious people can access the mindset they can connect better with people and change their mindset. There has always been a gap between practice and religion. The conflict has made wounds which are too deep and without healing the wounds first, we cannot think of reconciliation, Jayaweera added.
Together with Dishani Jayaweera, Chandra Ratnayake who is a co-founder of `Woman has been a strength in achieving its mission of interconnecting sisterhood that ignites inner power of women by healing, celebrating diversity and womanhood through creative and nature friendly efforts. Ratnayaka assist many women from different paths and struggles to make products that will empower them financially.
While healing the wounds and interconnecting with each other, we also empower these women economically. We exchange knowledge and share our experiences. Through our work we want to create new things which are environmentally friendly. We are together like a family. We live in one house for days when we have to complete work. There is no one above anyone. We all take part in creating things that are novel to the market and produce non harmful products for the Good Market in Colombo. We learn from each other and grow together. I am experiencing a whole new culture full with togetherness and fairness. I have friends in all communities, Ratnayaka said.
The gardens, kitchen, stitching centres became a medium of dialogue for us. While we connect to our own religion and culture, we also got the opportunity to explore anothers religion and culture. We understood that we can work without discrimination, she added.
Ratnayaka said in future they hope to introduce their products under the `Woman label to the markets in Colombo.
Hidden talents
Most of us did not realize our talents. We were caged then but now we are social. We are confident and I believe we are examples for women who question their limitations. We have liberated from self-censored thinking and at present most of us are feeling brand new, Ratnayaka added.
A team member from the Nothern Province, C. P. Koushalya joined in to voice her opinion and experience in this initiative of healing the wounds of the past and reconciliation.
For the first time in our lives we understood that peace can be obtained. If ever ethnic problems arise once again, I am sure the Sinhalese will stand for us and raise their voice. We are not alone in this journey of life. When we feel the love and caring of the Sinhalese people, we feel guilty that we have been so closed. We realise the mistakes on our side and it is sad to ignore their concern. Sinhalese also feel the same way about us and the Interfaith Womens Collective is an opportunity to bridge the gap between the communities. The journey we start today will continue until eternal peace is dawned through reconciliation, Koushalya said.
After the conflict we had many groups in Jaffna assisting us with our livelihood, but this time we experience a difference. When it comes to stitching, the instructors from other districts and areas take us through the whole process from teaching, designing, selecting materials, cutting, prizing and marketing. We are being introduced to new fashions and trends in the Colombo market. So we are able to cater to the existing demand. We also get the opportunity to participate in cookery classes and we are given the knowledge of baking cakes which is new to many of us, as we are more accustomed to traditional recipes. Another new area we were exposed to is photography. Many ladies are able to take up photography as a profession in Jaffna. About sixty women are involved in the Jaffna circle. It is a joy to work with all these wonderful women of all parts of the country, she added.
It is not all work for these women, but there is rest and play too. Dancing to traditional music, taking photographs and enjoying the different cultures enrich their lives. `Woman hubs are designed in such a way for women to come together, to share their lives and to connect themselves with others, to listen to oneself and another in a deeper level while being in a community that contributes to heal the past and build the future.
`Woman is hoping to initiate alternative education centres for young girls in Jaffna, especially in war affected areas. Film making initiative for young girls from different ethnic, religious, political backgrounds, setting up healing hubs at regional level (natural building and eco village concepts) and promoting healing through art, culture, spiritual practices and gardening are also a few other areas that will be explored to uplift the communities in Sri Lanka offering them a better future in togetherness and fairness.

Narendra Modi to become first Indian PM to visit Israel

Narendra Modi will become the first Indian Prime Minister to visit Israel when he arrives on Tuesday.
Modi, whorecently saidIndia and the Jewish state share a "deep and centuries-old" connection, is expected to agree military and cyber security deals.
Observers note he will not travel to Ramallah or meet Palestinian leaders, as visiting dignitaries often do.
The visit is seen by some as a turning point on India's position on Israel.
Here is what the focus will be on over the next three days:
Defence deals will be top of the agenda
For years, Israel and India have been working closely together on counter-terrorism and defence issues and India has been a regular customer of arms from the Jewish state.
The co-operation ranges from a jointly built air defence system to India buying drones, radar, cyber security and communication systems.
Aside from defence deals, the two countries also want to expand cooperation in other areas, notably Israel helping India to improve agricultural productivity and food security.
The two countries are set to build closer ties
India and Israel have had diplomatic relations for 25 years.
In the past however, the relationship has always been a balancing act given India's sizeable Muslim population and the country's dependence on oil imports from Arab countries and Iran.
Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has described Modi's visit as "historic", saying it would "deepen co-operation in a wide range of fields - security, agriculture, water, energy - basically in almost every field Israel is involved in".
Modi will also be meeting an Israeli boy, Moshe Holtzberg, whose parents were killed whengunmen stormed a Jewish centre in Mumbaiduring a 2008 terror attack.
Six Jewish people were killed at the centre, which was one of several places targeted in the November 2008 attacks.
The red carpet will be rolled out
Israel is giving its guest the high-level red carpet treatment.
Netanyahu will go beyond the usual protocol of meeting visiting leaders on a few occasions during their trip. In the case of Modi, he will accompany him for most of the visit, an honour usually reserved for only top level guests like the US president.
Netanyahu's office tweeted he would join his guest "at many events during his visit as befits the leader of the largest democracy in the world".
The two are expected to visit the Israel Museum and an agricultural project together and Netanyahu will attend a rally his counterpart plans for Jewish people of Indian origin living in Israel.

The lyrics are deeply meaningful and inspiring. They are insightful and thought provoking. It speaks of life and how to face life with the right attitude. It talks about fighting back. It talks of never giving up. It talks of persevering and taking up the challenge.
You needed a trailWe helped you blaze itAll the roadsWe helped you make itYou needed an adventureWe took you thereYou unleashed your wingsAnd we became the air(Chorus)We never never stop moving ///(Bridge)
You needed a heroWe became itYou took the journeyWe helped you make itYouve got the powerJust go embrace itTake a chanceCoz you can make itBreak down the bouldersFly through the airJust unleash your wings and we can take you there.
Titled Never Stop Moving, the video is produced and directed by the award winning Sri Lankan music director, play back singer and video director Sachith Peiris, featuring American Pop and Classical vocalist Casey Breves who recently sang with Adele at Radio City Music Hall
Daily News attended the music launch of this music video that was electrifying.
I chose to work with Casey Breves because he is a talented singer. It was easy to work with him because he's very professional. Casey instantly came to my mind when I finalized the track. The girl who performs alongside Casey is Vidya, and she is famous because of her youtube covers, said Peiris
The lyrics are by Ashanthi De Alwis and they are intensely stirring lyrics. Ashanthi is known as a prolific Sri Lanka rapper, singer and songwriter.
Ashanthi is of course very gifted and it was nothing new to me because I've worked with her from the beginning and she's a close friend of mine, also talented. The entire music video is my brain child, the whole concept is mine, stated Peiris
Casey has a powerful presence in the music industry. Casey recently sang with Adele at Radio city music hall. Casey sang with Grammy award-winning male vocal ensemble 'Chaticleer' from 2010-2013
This is my second production with CEAT, I have a good relationship with the whole CEAT Sri Lanka team. I shared my concept with them and they were happy to be a part of this. Sri Lanka is so beautiful and my idea was to take Sri Lanka to the world through this Music Video. To do this we feature powerful and evocative imagery of Sri Lanka places, explained Peiris.
Never Stop Moving can be viewed on Youtube, Facebook and Google and is also expected to be telecasted by local channels shortly.
I hope the exciting imagery created by Director of Photography Chamath Hansaka and the skills of Production Coordinator Yashinka Silva will resonate with audiences around the world and generate wider interest in what Sri Lanka has to offer its people, visitors, while providing music enthusiasts with great entertainment, pointed out Peiris.
The video produced and launched in Sri Lanka has the sponsorship support of CEAT
Our company finds Sachiths effort to portray Sri Lankas potential as a cornucopia of attractions and exciting experiences appealing and worthy of support. As a maker of tyres, CEATs principal role is to help people get to places and the title and theme of the music video is so aligned to what we are about. We were convinced to support its production, added Marketing of Sponsor CEAT Kelani Holdings, Deputy General Manager Bishri Latiff.
It is a kaleidoscopic showcase of Sri Lanka. The music video showcases Sri Lanka with stimulating references to blazing trails, unleashing wings, embracing the power and flying through the air, the video is all about the journey and the importance of never stopping, said Peiris.
Never Stop Moving is the second music video sponsored by CEAT. The first was Miringuwa Parada by German based Sri Lankan musician Chitral Sompala. It was a phenomenal success when it was launched in 2013.
In a similar fashion Never Stop Moving promises to be an equally fantastic music video because of Sachith and his talented musicians who are really doing a service to Sri Lanka. The music video has all the makings of success. Pictures by Shan Rambukwella

New income tax bill will simplify sources of income - Moodys
The new income tax bill, among other things, will simplify the sources of income, introduce a three-tier tax structure with reduced exemptions and reintroduce the capital gains tax, says Moodys Investors Service.
The act also proposes modernizing rules related to cross-border transactions to address base erosion and tax avoidance, broadening the tax base by removing excess tax incentives and expanding income tax sources.
The proposed revisions to the Inland Revenue Act, will contribute to increasing Sri Lankas very low level of government revenues, a key constraint on the sovereign credit profile.
The gazetting of the proposed tax reforms also paves the way for the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to approve a pending third loan tranche from Sri Lankas three-year, US$1.5 billion Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme.
The continuity of the IMF programme will support the authorities ongoing fiscal and structural reform efforts while the disbursement of the US$168 million loan will boost Sri Lankas external liquidity position.
Sri Lankas current Inland Revenue Act is a complicated tax scheme that hinders the transparency of taxes for potential investors in fixed and financial assets, limits the effectiveness of local tax officials supervision efforts and contributes to a very low tax-to-GDP ratio.
In particular, the current Act does not efficiently deal with modern business structures and commercial transactions, including cross-border transactions.
The implementation of revenue reforms that foster long-term fiscal consolidation will be critical to shoring up Sri Lankas credit profile.
The countrys large debt burden and weak debt affordability weigh significantly on its creditworthiness. The governments debt burden of 79.3% of GDP in 2016 was higher than the median of 53% for B-rated sovereigns.
The debt burden has risen from a low of 68.7% of GDP in 2012. With nominal GDP growth forecast to be slower in coming years than over the past decade, persistent and sizeable fiscal deficits would further increase Sri Lankas debt stock.
Sri Lankas low income tax efficiency and tax collection provide significant scope for revenue reforms that target broadening of the tax base and increasing the tax revenue-to-GDP ratio, which was only 12.4% in 2016.
Total government revenues (combined tax and non-tax) are also very low, with a general government revenue-to-GDP ratio of only 14.3% in 2016, one of the lowest among B-rated sovereigns.
Implementation of the value-added tax (VAT) rate hike in late 2016 will contribute to higher revenue generation in 2017. Moving forward, if the governments revenue reforms, including the new Inland Revenue Act, are implemented successfully, we expect general government revenues to increase to about 14.7% of GDP in 2017 and 15.0% by 2018. The IMF projects revenues to rise further to about 16% of GDP by 2021.
Given Sri Lankas weak fiscal position and need for growth-enhancing public expenditure on infrastructure and development programmes, the governments plans to increase revenues will play an important role in bolstering debt sustainability and fiscal consolidation.
Revenue mobilization efforts will help create fiscal space for such increased spending and deficit reduction, while also tempering external vulnerabilities. If successful, these measures will contribute to the strengthening of Sri Lankas credit profile. However, we expect the benefits of revenue reforms to accrue slowly over time.
Beside the impact of fiscal reform on revenue collection, continuity of the IMF programme will provide ongoing support to the authorities future fiscal and structural reform efforts.
Meanwhile, disbursement of Sri Lankas third IMF EFF loan tranche will help support the countrys external liquidity position. The governments high debt levels and large financing needs - we estimate borrowing requirements at 17.8% of GDP in 2017 - has resulted in significant external vulnerability and government liquidity risk. Continuation of the IMF programme will provide direct liquidity and policy support through 2019.

Over 70 hospitality students graduate from SLITHM
The countrys premier hospitality education provider, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) conducted its 38th Graduation Ceremony yesterday at the BMICH.
Inaugurated in 1964 as the Ceylon Hotel School, it is the pioneer and foremost education institute in the field of tourism and hospitality in the country. The institution changed its name to SLITHM in 2007 in line with the restructuring of the then Ceylon Tourist Board, becoming an autonomous institution coming under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism Development.
The graduation ceremony is the most important event in the SLITHM calendar as it marks the successful completion of the four-year management diploma in hotel operations and other management courses.
This years graduation ceremony is the 38th since its inception and a total of 77 graduates will step in to the world as fully qualified tourism and hospitality professionals.
The new graduates are the torch bearers of Sri Lankas evolving tourism industry. Their talents, knowledge and skills acquired through intense training at SLITHM will define the success of the industry in the years to come. Im confident that Sri Lanka will continue to stand out for its world-class hospitality through the invaluable contribution of SLITHM to the countrys tourism development efforts, said the Chief Guest at the Graduation Ceremony, Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga
The SLITHM main campus in Colombo is a purpose-designed training facility offering students a holistic education experience in the different aspects of tourism and hospitality.
SLITHM plays an important role in providing the skills set necessary for our youth to contribute to the growth of the tourism sector. I commend the Chairman and Management for their commitment and dedication in bringing out the best of the students that enter its portals, said Deputy Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Arundika Fernando.
SLITHM has developed an extensive network of satellite schools all across the country in order to attract and train youth in the fine art of hospitality. In addition to the existing satellite schools in Kandy, Anuradhapura, Koggala, Bandarawela, Ratnapura and Kurunegala, Minister Amaratunga has launched an expansion drive with new training schools opened in Hambantota, Pasikudah, Polonnaruwa and Negombo in the recent past. Rather than waiting for students to come to us, we must go to their doorstep and wherever new hotels are being built, explained Minister Amaratunga who has taken a personal interest in raising Sri Lankas service standards.
SLITHM is the premier hospitality-tourism education provider in Sri Lanka and is the undisputed leader in turning out competent and skilled industry professionals required by the industry, said the Secretary to the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs P.H.J.B. Sugathadasa.
With Sri Lankas tourism arrivals crossing the two million mark and dozens of new hotels coming up across the country, the industry requires thousands of new workers. In order to cater to the demand SLITHM has nearly doubled its output of basic trained students from 3,000 per year to nearly 6,000 per year.
SLITHM students are competent in a broad range of management knowhow in tourism and hospitality operations; they are among the top achievers both in Sri Lanka and abroad. I urge all those graduating today to be role models in their chosen field and become leaders of the tourism and hospitality industries in this country, just as their predecessors have done. I congratulate all those graduating today; you have done well and deserve to celebrate. said Chairman of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management, Sunil Dissanayake.
Combined with the best academic inputs and an unmatchable practical training environment, SLITHM continues to deliver the best industry professionals through holistic learning. This is why our graduates stand out from the rest. The icing on the cake is our synergy with the industry, which will propel these graduates on to greater heights, said Director General, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management, Buddhika Hewawasam.

PARIS ACCORD: FORGET TEMPERATURE,ADDRESS PRECIPITATION
What is climate change - the scientists view point
Climate change is explained by Prof. John Seinfeld of Caltech University as follows:

(1) Fossil fuel combustion yields CO2 increasing its concentration in the atmosphere and part of this is taken up by vegetation, soils and oceans.
(2) When CO2 concentration in atmosphere reaches 560ppm (i.e. increase of 280 ppm or twice what it was prior to the Industrial Revolution), the temperature increases by 1.20C due to this CO2 concentration.
(3) This1.20C temperature increase brings more water vapour into the atmosphere to maintain constant relative humidity and this water vapour increases temperature by another 1.60C, and the total temperature increase is 2.80C.
(4) Today the CO2 concentration in atmosphere is 407+ ppm.
This increase in atmospheric temperature leads to (i) inconveniences on land - reduced agricultural production, enhanced contagious diseases, etc (ii) destruction of oceanic resources - rare species of fish, corals, etc, and (iii) reduction of ice caps and subsequent upping of oceanic water levels. This would also lead to areas experiencing temperate climate conditions been forced to experience unbearable conditions.
How water influences climate change
Water vapour directly influences all three climate parameters - temperature, precipitation and wind. What disturbs our life mostly is precipitation. Both excessive precipitation as well as lack of it leads to human misery. Our ability to protect ourselves from a climate calamity is also the least in respect of water vapour. It disturbs our normal life whether it is up in the air or is coming down or is on the ground.
According to Global Trends in Water Related Disasters  An Insight for Policy Makers, a report published by Yoganath Adikari and Junichi Yoshitani, of the International Centre for Water Hazard and Risk Management (ICHARM), 71% of natural disaster fatalities between 1980 and 2006 had taken place in Asia of which more than 81% had been flood related. Does not this clearly indicate that for us in Asia, at least, water-related disasters need to be controlled before temperature related ones
Water, in different forms, goes through the global water cycle and is supposed to be of constant quantity.There is no natural process wherein water is generated or broken down to oxygen and hydrogen on a scale comparable to that associated with CO2. So whenever water vapour is formed using oxygen in the atmosphere, that oxygen is not replaced. So we have come to four conclusions from these facts:
(i)Water is the compound which affects and participates in all three climate parameters, temperature, precipitation and wind.
(ii)Water affects us whether it is up in the air or coming down or on the ground.
(iii)Formation of water (this definitely happens when we burn gas or oil as mentioned in the next few sections) using fresh oxygen in the atmosphere is not reversible in the scale of even thousands of years.
(iv) While lifetime of CO 2 in the atmosphere is about a thousand years, that of Newly Formed Water ( NFW ) in the global system may be a million years.
Sustainable Energy by Prof. Jefferson Tester (of Cornell University) and five other professors/researchers at MIT has four bits of information about this climate problem and its resolution: (1) Plate No. 4 (after Page 162) shows that USA in 2007 used 23.63 QnBtus from natural gas and 39.81QnBtus from petroleum. (2) Plate No. 16 (after page 162) has the Integrated Global System Model version 2 (IGSM2) developed by MIT. (3) Table 8.1 says Natural Gas has 3.5  4.0 atoms of H2 and Gasolene has 2-2.2 atoms of H2 for every atom of carbon. (4) Figure 4.1 shows how energy systems consume human and natural resources and produce useful goods and services and interact with the environment.
Table 8.1 implies that when oil or gas is combusted, hydrogen in the fuel, with O2 in air give out Newly Formed Water (NFW)  that is water which was not in the global water cycle earlier.
This NFW vapour with characteristics given below is the most dangerous output of anthropogenic energy generation processes:
(1) It is far more dangerous a greenhouse gas than CO2 when in the atmosphere.
(2) It leads to cyclones, hurricanes etc. when coming down. It fulfills five of the six atmospheric conditions required for a cyclone. The other is a location specific requirement.
(3) When on the ground, it leads to floods, earth slips, landslides, etc.
(4) No wall could keep these disasters away.
(5) Although it is generated in a distributed fashion timewise and area wise  it accumulates in the atmosphere - timewise and area wise - and comes down in a concentrated fashion.
(6) Even without this NFW vapour, water vapour from global water cycle alone could create water-related disasters and this NFW vapour aggravates these.
Positive feedback effect of water vapour
When climate scientists dismiss the greenhouse effect of NFW vapour, they make two assumptions: (i) water vapour that comes into the atmosphere from below is of two kinds: (a) water vapour that comes even during normal times - i.e. even if fossil fuels are not combusted - which spend 7-14 days in the atmosphere and (b) water vapour coming into the atmosphere, when a fossil fuel is combusted, to maintain constant relative humidity at the elevated temperature due to higher CO2 concentration in the atmosphere which is retained in the atmosphere till this extra CO2 is in the atmosphere.
IGSM2 captures these streams within the Coupled Ocean, Atmosphere and Land System. Solar or volcanic forcing initiates the first identified as (a) while gaseous flow (of CO2,CH4, etc.) from the human system to the earth system initiates the second identified as (b).
(ii) The second is that NFW vapour from combustion of gas and oil also spends only 7-14 days in the atmosphere like the other water vapour stream, identified as (a) above, due to solar and volcanic forcing. IGSM2 indicates clearly that they have disregarded NFW vapour from fossil fuel combustion.
NFW vapour differs from the other two in respect of the following characteristics:
(a) Both those streams were already in the form of water in the global water cycle. NFW is new water formed by the combination of H2 in the fuel and O2 in the atmosphere. Hence it should go into the MIT Model IGSM2 as a part of the stream from the human system to the earth system.
(b) This NFW enters the atmosphere along with CO2, from C in the fuel, and it will not precipitate unless the temperature comes down due to seasonal changes.
(c) As long as this new CO2 stays in the atmosphere this NFW will also remain with CO2. Due to the differences in diffusivity and density of H2O from those of CO2, this NFW will move up ahead of CO2 and bring about its effects as a greenhouse gas and will not come down soon.
(d) This NFW vapour will be at a higher temperature than water vapour coming up to cool the atmosphere or to retain constant relative humidity.
(e) Heat content brought into the atmosphere by NFW is much larger than that brought in by CO2.
(f) Even if it comes down, it could lead to all disasters associated with precipitation and wind.
International Energy Agencys document 'Revisiting Energy - Climate Change Map' published in mid-2013 talks about predictions for temperature increases arising from 560ppm CO2 in the atmosphere being 3.60C instead of 2.80C suggested earlier. This extra 0.80 C temperature increase could be due to this water vapour.
Why water-related disasters in USA
According to the Hadley Circulation model, air flows originating from about 00N would go up and towards 300N, carrying water vapour, etc., and drop the water vapour at around 300N and come down and back. 300N is around New Orleans, California, etc. So it is no wonder that during some months of the year the area gets hurricanes and excessive rains. This new water vapour creates the conditions ideal for hurricanes with water vapour having a viscosity about half of those of N2 and O2
Longitudinal air circulation as per the Walker Circulation shows air streams from way down as 1500W going up as high as 15km and towards 900W and coming down. It explains how all the NFW vapour thrown out by natural gas and oil burnt in USA ultimately comes down on USA itself. The 2.54 Gt of NFW from oil and gas combustion in 2007 would explain 65% of the increase in precipitation - 0.15 in per decade - reported in USEPA website in 2014. Both these assumes that 2.54 Gt would fall on the entire 9.5 million km2 area.
Paris Accord
It is not prudent to talk only about temperature increase and CO2 concentration, ignoring NFW vapour, precipitation and wind in addressing climate change resolution for mankind. The Paris Accord says that we should keep warming well below 20C which implies that we are looking at only the temperature and ignoring precipitation and wind.
Abovementioned facts show that combustion of oil and gas yields NFW which could yield (i) greenhouse gas effect leading to enhanced temperature, droughts when in the atmosphere (ii) increased cyclones, hurricanes etc. related to wind when coming down and (iii) increased precipitation, flooding leading to loss of human life and agricultural production when on the ground.
Any international consensus to relieve world population living at different latitudes and longitudes from the travails of climate change need to identify how these different communities are influenced by different products of anthropogenic activities including energy generation which leads to NFW, CO2, etc.
A Nobel Laureate in Physics has recently said that the current increase in atmospheric temperature may be due to deforestation and tarred roadways. Out of all manmade structures, the highway is probably the place where they would (1) have carried out a lot of deforestation - loss of (a) CO2 absorption (b) trans-evaporation (c) reflection of solar radiation, etc. (2) put up a black, asphaltic surface absorbing near 90% solar radiation which gets re-emitted leading to global warming and then (3) start running vehicles generating CO2 and NFW vapour.
We developed highway solarisation - dedicated infrastructure to generate electricity to power electric vehicles or grid using solar energy collected by PV solar panels installed along and above highways as a solution for climate change to address exactly this. It will negate the first two concerns partially, but significantly and third, if the electricity generated is used to power electric vehicles to a degree which will depend on the level of vehicle electrification.
For every 1kWhr of electricity it provides to the main grid, it will eliminate 1.4 kWhr of radiation leading to global warming and if this electricity is used for vehicle electrification it will further eliminate 1.3kg of CO2, 0.5kg of NFW vapour and 4kWhr of waste heat, leading to climate change.
Conclusion
While we thank President Donald Trump for making us relook the Paris Accord and Climate Change, we wish he would be bold enough to take corrective action to relieve the American citizenry from travails associated with anthropogenic energy generation as practised today.
We are impressed by his own decision to put up photovoltaic solar panels on the wall he is to build along the Mexican border. Obviously, he would not miss the tremendous potential of its extension to highway solarisation of the 48,000 mile-interstate highway which when realized will convert it from the 18% marks, D-grade (as assessed by American Society of Civil Engineers in 2013) road infrastructure to be the best, most productive and most protected (from sunlight, precipitation including snow and also from salt to remove the snow) highway in the world. This interstate highway could provide 225 GW of power or 225TWhrs of energy to power 100 million electric vehicles of medium size to be available on the highway itself.

Physician, heal thyself
The strikes, in general, are considered as a legitimate form of collective protest in a democratic country. They are an important weapon that workers possess and use to increase their bargaining power as well as facilitating the process of negotiation towards an agreeable result.
The latest wave of strikes was by medical doctors. It has now become a common regular phenomenon. Citizens become aware of a doctors strike only in the morning when they read or listen to the news. Patients become aware when they visit the hospitals. Since of late GMOA leaders give only short notice.
Health is a very important human value and hence health care is a paramount social obligation. In this context, on one hand, doctors have more responsibility on the health of each and every citizen of the country. On the other hand, doctors also may have their own grievances. These may be monetary factors or non-monetary aspects such as healthcare policy issues, better working conditions etc.
Doctors argue that they are compelled to take tough action to make their needs or demands met and that they go for strike decision as an ultimate choice of action. This argument does not hold water since we have seen how strikes by doctors are occurring with increasing frequency during the last few months for the slightest excuse. We have also witnessed how most of these strikes have been harmful to patients as these actions reduced patients access to care by eliminating or delaying necessary care, and may, at times interfere with the continuity of such care.
The recent doctors strikes, regardless of the reasons for them, received a lot of media attention and met a great deal of criticism and resistance from the general public. In fact, it aroused intense debate on the ethical justification of medical professionals failing to prioritise human life and their needs, without finding less harmful ways of negotiating their demands.
In such a complex situation, various ethical dilemmas have arisen whether doctors strikes can be ethically legitimate, especially in the Sri Lankan scenario Do they have the right to strikes or work slowdowns, even if they have a genuine reason, which may put the lives of defenceless patients at serious danger
Demand
In this brief article, I do not wish to discuss the advantages or disadvantages of SAITM or private medical education. That debate is being extensively done and continuing in the media. My only intention is to present my view regarding whether the current strikes by GMOA are ethically acceptable or not.
I do not have any affiliation or fraternity either with SAITM or with GMOA. When we go through the information available in the public domain, SAITM appears to have quite a number of serious shortcomings and deficits which need to be rectified. In the case of GMOA, for a long time I have regarded it as a professional organisation, but now I have my own reservations. The associations view on the higher medical educations seems to be vague and confused.
The main demand of the latest strike by GMOA is for the government to abolish the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM). It is nothing about their salaries, allowances or working conditions. The doctors maintain that the private Medical College does not meet the country's educational standards. They also say the existence of the private medical college could jeopardise the country's decades-long tradition of offering health care and education for free.
However, the trigger for the GMOA unrest was the Court of Appeal decision compelling the SLMC to register SAITM graduates. The Court has arrived at its judgement based strictly on the legalities of the issue and observed that the SLMC has no power to take over the functions of the Higher Education Minister.
The court ruled that recognition (or de-recognition) of SAITM was the prerogative of the Minister of Higher Education. Similarly, while the Medical Council can make recommendations regarding the registration of a medical degree, the authority for that decision finally rests with the Minister for Health.
This is the current legal stand on SAITM issue and both the GMOA and SAITM need to abide by it. If the association does not agree with the decision, they are within their rights to appeal to Supreme Court. News reports indicate they have already done so. Now its a matter of waiting for the judgement.
Ethical factors
With all these points in mind, we can now access the ethical aspects of the doctors strikes. Let me present my views in point form:
(1) Why did GMOA initiate strike action when there were alternatives to proceed were available. This contradicts their argument of last resort.
(2) The timing of the strike. Why did GMOA wait for eight years to press action to scrap SAITM This medical college was established in 2008 under former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
(3) Hippocrates oath. When you consider this oath and the importance of the term profession in the medical field, two arguments can be put forward. In one sense, profession emphasis a promise (profession), a vow to dedicate oneself to the benefit or well-being of the patient which stress on the overall fulfilment of some broad societal need. In another sense profession is a job, which has many rights and duties. What does a Sri Lanka doctor belong to First or second category!
(4) Dedication and compassion. These two qualities have always been promoted as important virtues in Sri Lankan medical field. We developed our own Ayurvedic system based on a series of prescriptions handed down from generation to generation over a period of 3,000 years. The ancient kings, who were also prominent physicians, sustained its survival and longevity. Historically the Ayurvedic physicians enjoyed a noble position in the country's social hierarchy due to their royal patronage. From this legacy stems a well-known Sri Lankan saying: If you cannot be a king, become a healer. Thus, the practice of doctors strikes is not compatible with the Sri Lankan cultural and traditional health care ethics.
(5) Patients Rights. GMOA is a registered trade union. The membership believes that they have every right to take trade union action if a situation called for it. Technically, it is correct. However, doctors right to strike should never conflict and override with the patients right to access health care since they are more dependent and vulnerable. Moreover, use of ones right (doctors) to strike will violate the fundamental rights of the other (patients) to the extent that it even denies them right to live, apart from their rights to proper health care.
In such a situation, the Sri Lankan Government can legally activate laws like the Public Security Ordinance. Just the other day President Sirisena used the Public Security Ordinance to declare certain services connected with the Meethotamulla tragedy essential and threatened violators with punitive action.
(6) Abuse of Freedom to Strike. Doctors are currently legally allowed to strike. But other individuals who work in key public services are not allowed to strike. For example, members of the armed forces cannot strike. Police officers cannot strike. Prison officers cannot strike. Many countries, both in Europe and elsewhere, limit or prevent some public employees from striking. Is there a reason for banning strikes by police or soldiers, but for permitting strikes by doctors
The ethical justification for restricting or removing the right to strike for police or armed forces or prison officers is on the basis of the threat to public order or wellbeing or national security in the event of a strike. The potential harm to the wider community is thought to outweigh the harm to individual freedom in restricting the right to strike.
Freedom of Assembly
The European Convention on Human Rights enshrines the right to freedom of assembly and association (including trade union membership), however, it potentially leaves open the possibility of restrictions on these rights in the interests of national security or public safety, for the prevention of disorder or crime, for the protection of health or morals or for the protection of the rights and freedoms of others.
If the reason to prohibit police strikes is the potential harm to the wider community, that might also apply to doctor strikes. We might expect that such strikes could lead to delays in diagnosis and treatment of serious illness, and might even lead to higher death rates for patients.
As a parting note, let me remind our doctors that from childhood we were taught that doctors make great sacrifices to save lives. This belief gave the doctors profession a great deal of respect in the society. Yet, it appears this respect is eroding and eroding rather rapidly. The cancer of politics that has eroded most of the trade unions of public institutions in the society has touched the upper echelons of GMOA too. Its time all medical doctors stop in their tracks and take a hard look at their ideals and ethics which are presently limited only to their family and close friends.

His subsequent releases too, tanked at the box office which has made it all difficult for the budding actor. However, his upcoming venture, Ivan Thanthiran (He is a strategist), seems to be promising and by all means, is set to deliver the much-needed break for the young promising actor.
Two promotional teasers/trailers have been released by the team which focuses on the pros and cons of job and life at IT industry. Engineering students and IT employees who are large at numbers can easily relate to the teaser/trailer which is boosted by RJ Balajis dialogue delivery and expressions.
The promotional videos are already doing rounds on the social media and the movie is sure to attract a lot of youth audiences to theatres. Given the added advantage of no competition, the movie has all chances of scoring well at the box office.
Initially, Premam fame, Anupama Parameshwaran was considered to play the female lead in the action cum romantic thriller, while the role was later offered to Kannadas U-Turn fame Shraddha Srinath.
R. Kannan is seen to be donning the role of a producer and director for this movie while SS Thaman has scored music. Filmi Beat
The Tamil movie Ivan Thanthiran is screening at Capitol, Cine City, Cine Word, MC Jaffna, and City Cinema Mt Lavinia (9.30 am)

Qatar defiant as Saudis extend deadline to resolve Gulf rift
QATAR: Qatar appeared defiant as Saudi Arabia and its allies Monday extended a deadline for Doha to accept a series of demands to lift a de facto blockade.
Their demands include Doha ending support for the Muslim Brotherhood, the closure of Al-Jazeera television, a downgrade of diplomatic ties with Iran and the shutdown of a Turkish military base in the emirate.
Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt gave Doha 10 days to comply with their 13 demands, with the ultimatum due to expire at the end of Sunday.
The 48-hour extension was in response to a request by the Kuwaiti emir who is acting as mediator in the Gulf crisis.
Qatar said it would give its response to the emir, Sheikh Sabah al-Ahmad Al-Sabah, on Monday.
The letter will be handed over by Qatars Foreign Minister Sheikh Mohammed bin Abdulrahman Al-Thani.
The list of demands is made to be rejected, Sheikh Mohammed said Saturday.
Everyone is aware that these demands are meant to infringe the sovereignty of the state of Qatar, he said at a news conference in Rome.
The state of Qatar... is rejecting it as a principle, he said, adding: We are willing to engage in providing the proper conditions for further dialogue. Saudi Arabia and its allies announced on June 5 they were severing ties with their Gulf neighbour, sparking the worst diplomatic crisis to hit the region in decades.
They accused Doha of supporting extremism and of being too close to regional arch-rival Iran, which Qatar has strongly denied.
The crisis has raised concerns of growing instability in the region, home to some of the worlds largest energy producers and several key Western allies hosting US military facilities.
German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel, who on Monday starts a tour of several Arab states, called for a serious dialogue to end the crisis.
We are worried that the distrust and the disunity could weaken all the parties concerned as well as the entire peninsula, said Gabriel, who will visit Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Qatar.
Riyadh and its supporters have already severed air, sea and ground links with Qatar, cutting off vital routes for imports including food.
Qatari citizens were ordered to leave the countries and various steps were taken against Qatari companies and financial institutions.
It is unclear what further measures will be taken if Qatar fails to meet the demands, but the UAE ambassador to Russia Omar Ghobash warned last week that further sanctions could be imposed.

Six films to watch this July [Video]

July is due to be a fruitful month for film releases, as Sofia Coppola's latest offering and Tom Hardy's new flick hit our screens.
These are the six films worth giving up an evening in the sun for, or at least saving for a rainy day.
The Beguiled (out on July 14)

Directed by:Sofia Coppola
Starring:Nicole Kidman, Kirsten Dunst, Elle Fanning
What's it all about:Sofia Coppola's latest offering and for which she won the Best Director award at this year's Cannes Film Festival is a remake of a Clint Eastwood Civil War Movie, only framed from a female perspective and filtered through Coppola's hazy, dream-like lens.
Based on Thomas P. Cullinan's Southern gothic tale of 1966, the film tells the tale of John McBurney, an injured Union soldier played by Colin Farrell, who takes refuge in a boarding school run by female staff, which becomes the centre of sexual tension and dangerous rivalries as they compete for his affections. Expect eerie tension and subtle touches of black humour.
To The Bone (out on July 14)
Directed by:Marti Noxon
Starring:Lily Collins, Keanu Reeves
What's it all about:In this Netflix exclusive inspired by the writer/director's own experiences, Lily Collins plays an unruly, 20-year-oldwoman suffering from anorexia, who spends the better part of her teenage years being moved around from one recovery program to another with no success, before being sent to a group home led by a non-traditional doctor, in a last attempt to try and help her.
Whilst this filmisn't easy viewing and hasfaced ample controversy due to the sensitive nature of its subject matter, it was a hit at Sundance and beinginformed by both Noxon's and Collins' personal battles with the illness, it has been written and performed with real empathy.
David Lynch: The Art Life (out on July 14)
Directed by:Jon Nguyen, Rick Barnes
Starring:David Lynch
What's it all about:If you've ever wanted to understand how the brilliantly dark Lynchian mind works, then this new intimate documentary chronicling his formative years, is your chance.
The documentary, which is narrated by Lynch himself, is composed of old footage and unseen home videos of the filmmaker from his early years andtime as a surrealist painter working in his studio in the Hollywood Hills, long beforeTwin PeaksandMulholland Drive, giving usa fuller picture of the idiosyncratic genius that is Lynch.
Dunkirk (out on July 14)
Directed by:Christopher Nolan
Starring:Tom Hardy, Cillian Murphy, Harry Styles
What's it all about:AcclaimedInceptionandInterstellardirector Christopher Nolan's latest project about the 1940 evacuation of 400,000 soldiers on the beach at Dunkirk during the Second World War is one of the most anticipated cinematic releases of the year - not least because of its swoon-worthy cast, featuring none other than former 1D star, Harry Styles who makes his big screen debut.
Nolan said that he chose to approach the film more as a suspenseful survival story than a war epic, and judging by the trailer, it looks as thoughit will offer plenty of suspenseful scenes.
Girls Trip (out on July 26)
Directed by:Malcolm D. Lee
Starring:Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah, Kate Walsh
What's it all about: In this heart-warming and up-lifting rom com, four lifelong friends travel to New Orleans for the annualEssence Festival and have their sisterhoods rekindled, and wild sides rediscovered.

SL can move from 110 to 70 in Doing Business Index ranking
Sri Lankas target of improving on the Doing Business Index ranking from 110 to 70 in three years is an ambitious but achievable target, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama.
Speaking at the launch of the Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms in Sri at Temple Trees by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe he said that to achieve this target, reforms should be fast tracked closely and coordinated.
The minister said the result of this would not be seen in the Doing Business Index next years as it is too soon. However we would be able to see tangible results from 2019 onwards, he said.
Meanwhile Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that several new legislature too would be introduced to see that the Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms would be implemented.
World Bank Country Director for Sri Lanka and Maldives Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough, said that the Doing Business Index is a key mirror for a countrys good track record and its an benchmark which the investors closely follow. This is like a report card of a school boy, girl and only difference is that the results are published. One must also remember that the report is published not to put any country in to shame but to do changes and reform.
She also said that Georgia was one of the countrys that reformed very quickly and moved up in the ladder of the World Doing Business Index and today is a dream country for investors.
Deputy High Commissioner for Australia in Sri Lanka, Tim Huggins, said that it was difficult to do economic changes overnight and they should go through a process where the support of unions and public is needed. This is also a sensitive area as it also has an impact on voters.
Australia did this with great care after a lot of public debate and it was successful. However I must say that some of the changes that are being adopted in Sri Lanka are praiseworthy and I can say that Sri Lanka would be very successful in implementing them in the future.
State Minister for Development Strategies and International Trade Sujeeva Senasinghe said that the line Ministries would work closely with investors to implement this road map and minimize red tape. He recalled that in Japan when investors come across bottle necks they put a red flag in the factory and the government intervenes. This was done by Toyota Company in Japan, he said.

SL to focus on export economy
Sri Lanka would move toward an export oriented economy and cut down on infrastructure development funded by high commercial borrowing, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Speaking at the Launch of The Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms at Temple Trees yesterday, the Prime Minister said the country had suffered as a result of the loss of its competitive advantage.
In those years, the economy did not generate sufficient high paying jobs. In addition, the volume of tradable goods reduced as a percentage and we lost the competitive advantage,the Prime Minister said.
Wickremesinghe further said that the government also was focused on increasing Sri Lankas doing Business index ranking from the present 110th position.
We want to bring this up to 70 by 2020,he said.
The Prime Minister said this would bring Sri Lanka closer with several other Asian countries like Thailand, (46) Malaysia (23).
However, we are not going to stop there and we want to move further up, he said. He further said that the road map would help improve the private sector business environment by a great deal and also help woo more Foreign Direct Investment.
Premier Wickremesinghe further said that the Road Map on Investment Climate Reforms would target several reforms like the Single Window corridor, new land ownership laws, One stop Shop, several new economic zones, digital economy and task forces in several areas.
We will also change some legislation to simplify doing business in Sri Lanka and this in turn will help both local foreign investors, the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said that this in turn would help generate high paying stable jobs.
He however said that to achieve the full potential of this initiative,inflation and the Cost of Living has to come down and the economic reform programme must continue. The Premier recalled that in 1977 when the Open Economy was introduced, Sri Lanka was ahead of several other countries and only countries like Japan, Korea, Malaysia and Singapore were ahead of us.
But today, I am afraid to look back since only a few countries are behind us and this is the last chance Sri Lanka has to move forward,the Prime Minister said.

Tearful Stanley ends drought with PGA National playoff win
POTOMAC, Sunday: Kyle Stanley wiped away tears while pondering five years of struggle and doubt that ended Sunday with his playoff victory over fellow American Charles Howell to win the PGA National.
After both fired four-under par 66s at TPC Potomac to stand atop the leaderboard after 72 holes on seven-under 273, Stanley parred the first extra hole to capture his second PGA crown, the first coming 135 starts ago at the 2012 Phoenix Open.
There was some doubt there for a little bit, Stanley said. Its no fun. You question whether you are ever going to make it back. Tears trickled down his cheek. His voice cracked, then halted, as he spoke, seeking the right words to sum up his perseverance to sustain his career the past few seasons.
I wish I didnt cry so much, Stanley said. It just feels so good to put the work in and see the rewards. I think thats where most of the emotion is coming from. In the dramatic playoff on the par-4 18th hole, Stanley was in the right rough off the tee in the playoff but found the greenside rough, chipped to four feet and made the putt after Howell had missed his par bid. Im thrilled, Stanley said. Its very special to get a second win... I knew it was just a matter of time. Howell, coming off a 10-week layoff with a fractured rib, has not won in 293 PGA starts since taking a playoff over Phil Mickelson at Riviera in 2007. Im a bit shocked, Howell said. I cant believe how well I played. I started hitting balls eight or nine days ago.

The three new faculties will be established at Kurunegala, Ratnapura and Moratuwa.
The first in these series will be set up at Kurunegala by the end of this year, said Minister Lakshman Kiriella.
Work on the Ratnapura State Medical Faculty will be launched at the beginning of next year and the Moratuwa new faculty will be launched during the latter half of next year, Kiriella said.
It is the UNP which launched the free education system in Sri Lanka. It has no need to destroy free education but to further nurture it, he said.
Kiriella said the government spent Rs. 400,000 annually on each University student.
Despite this commitment towards free education, certain students were pointing the accusing finger at it alleging that it was trying to ban the free education system.

Transformers: The Last Knight : All sound and fury
Harriet Tubman  the iconic abolitionist who rescued slaves, later worked with the suffragettes, and will be the first woman to appear on American currency  was part of a secret society that knew about the existence of Transformers on Earth. Or so this movie atrociously suggests.
Director Michael Bay breaches the limits of farfetchedness with this entrant in the Transformers franchise. And that odd Harriet Tubman anecdote is the least ridiculous thing in its mythology.
Transformers, were told, helped King Arthur in his battles. His wizard, Merlin, was handed a magical staff by a Transformer, and the staff is the key to all creation on the planet of Cybertron. As Cybertron begins to decay, an evil queen leads it closer to Earth to attain the staff. Cade (Wahlberg), is the titular last knight who can stop the planets from colliding, and Vivian (Haddock) is the last surviving descendent of Merlin, who can find and yield the staff.
If you thought that was all too convoluted, dont worry, Mark Wahlberg probably thinks so too. His disinterest in the movies proceedings is almost visible on his face. Haddock is restricted to running in pretty clothes, while Anthony Hopkins  his presence here is as surprising as the movie is not  manages to bring a morsel of intrigue with his part.
By now, the world has accepted the Transformers movies to be unabashedly mindless, full of VFX explosions, goofy bro-humour and stereotypical female characters. In that sense, this movie delivers. It is 154 minutes of sensory overload. The most watchable bits have Jim Carter voicing Cogman, who is a cross between Star Wars C-3PO and Beauty And The Beasts Cogsworth. Much more of Cogmans wit and humour suffused with the deafening roar of car-wars would have made this a tad more watchable.
But otherwise, its the movie-equivalent of the string of 10,000 non-stop firecrackers that annoying kids burst outside your window in Diwali.

Twenty years after the Asian  Financial Crisis: What have we learned
This month marks 20 years since the Asian Financial Crisis. It's appropriate to consider at this juncture why the crisis happened and what we have learned about how countries can safeguard their economies from future shocks and deliver sustainable and inclusive growth.
The combined currency and banking crises started in Thailand in July 1997 and quickly spread to the Republic of Korea, Indonesia, Malaysia and the Philippines. In little more than a year, gross domestic product at the five crisis-affected countries fell by a combined 30%.
The crisis can be traced to the premature opening-up of capital accounts before domestic financial systems and regulations were ready. Short-term borrowing was liberalized even more than long-term foreign direct investment in those countries.
Encouraged by dollar-pegged exchange rates, portfolio investment and bank loans from advanced economies flooded into Asia before the crisis, fueling domestic asset and property price bubbles. Large short-term US-denominated debts financed long-term domestic investments, creating currency and maturity mismatches. Once it became clear they were unsustainable, capital flows suddenly reversed. This led to large devaluations of the currencies and massive bank defaults.
The international community quickly came to the rescue. The International Monetary Fund, World Bank, Asian Development Bank (ADB) and the region's governments provided foreign exchange liquidity and budget support. ADB offered $7.8 billion in loans over two years, mainly through fast disbursing policy-based lending for financial sector reform and social protection to Indonesia, the Republic of Korea, and Thailand.
In the event, countries recovered faster than expected. After the initial stabilization measures, authorities at crisis-affected countries reinforced sound macroeconomic policies supported by fiscal prudence and more independent central banks. They adopted more flexible exchange rates, strengthened financial sector regulation and governance and implemented structural reforms. Countries adopted more prudent approaches to capital account liberalization with better sequencing, consistent with domestic economic conditions. The crisis also gave strong impetus to regional cooperation initiatives.
Today, Asia has a stronger economic outlook. Developing Asia's economies grew 6.8% yearly over the past two decades, faster than any other region.The region's growth now relies much more on domestic demand. These achievements belie criticisms during the crisis that Asia's growth miracle was a myth and unsustainable.
I believe that the development pattern in Asia is evolving from the 'flying geese model' popular in the 1960s, in which certain industries shifted from the front runner - Japan - to the 'four tigers' and others as technology advanced. It is now based on a 'production sharing network model', in which different countries share parts of production processes, not necessarily reflecting their development stages.
This new process enables developing countries to integrate into the regional and global value chains more quickly, thereby facilitating technical and skills transfers which broaden growth opportunities for late comers.
But Asia should not be complacent. Around 330 million of its people still live in absolute poverty and many economies are experiencing rising inequality. Further steps are needed to make economies more resilient and ensure sustainable and inclusive growth.
First, countries must continue pursuing sound macroeconomic policies.They need to keep adequate fiscal space and international reserve buffers against future shocks. The region requires greater revenues from tax reforms and better collection to finance infrastructure and social sector needs.
Second, countries need deeper and broader financial systems. In addition to sound banking sectors, they need strong capital markets, especially in local currency bonds, both sovereign and corporate. The ASEAN+3 Asian Bond Markets Initiative, supported by ADB, has helped to expand outstanding local currency bonds from $1 trillion in 2002 to over $10 trillion in 2016.
Third, both macro- and micro-prudential policies are critical to maintain financial stability. Cross-border capital flows, domestic credit growth, and asset price inflation should be monitored closely. And much wider financial inclusion is needed, not just to support social equity, but to enhance sustainable growth by boosting access to financial services for small- and medium-sized enterprises and for households.
Fourth, the region must narrow large infrastructure gaps, which ADB estimates will require over $1.7 trillion a year through 2030. Over 400 million people still lack electricity and about 300 million have no access to safe drinking water.
Fifth, Asia must also address climate change risks through both mitigation and adaptation measures. By using smart urban planning and technology, Asian cities can be more resilient and livable.
Sixth, human capital development is essential for countries to advance and avoid the middle-income trap. Education systems should equip people with the necessary skills and knowledge to adapt to a rapidly-evolving technology and business environment. Adequate health services are urgently needed.
Finally, regional cooperation can mitigate risks from globalization. Financial crises are becoming more frequent and costly in a world of free capital flows and financial liberalization.
Strengthening regional financial cooperation for emergency financing, macroeconomic surveillance, and collective efforts for financial sector development through initiatives such as the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralization will contribute to macroeconomic and financial stability.
Asia is in a much stronger position than 20 years ago, but should remain vigilant.

## Title: The Uma Oya impasse

The Uma Oya impasse
Development, they say, is a necessary evil. Most development projects involve some kind of environmental trade off. This should be worth it for the project to succeed. On the other hand, there are some projects where the environmental damage far exceeds the benefits arising from the development project. These projects have no long term value and may in fact pose a danger to the lives of people in the long run.
The much-hyped Uma Oya project launched by the previous Government falls to the latter category. The avowed purpose of this project is the diversion of water to the Hambantota area, which does have a water shortage. It also happens to be the fiefdom of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa who had a habit of initiating massive projects squarely aimed at his hometown apparently to boost his ego and popularity. Among the white elephant projects which he started in the area are: the Mattala Rajapaksa International Airport, the Hambantota Port, the Hambantota Convention Centre and the Sooriyawewa cricket stadium, which is seeing some action during the current Zimbabwe tour.
Since these facilities are of little use, they cost the taxpayer heavily in two ways. Massive loans have been obtained to construct them and they have to be serviced from this year. This is funded by the public. Moreover the day-to-day operation of these projects is entirely funded by the public purse. Uma Oya too was such a grandiose project conceived by the Rajapaksa Government. And like most of the projects it initiated Uma Oya too had a corruption element. With a projected estimate of US$ 560 million, some experts say it has cost four times the actual estimate.
But the biggest casualty of the Uma Oya is not even the public purse which does get a bashing. It is the pristine environment of the Bandarawela area that has been affected the most by the construction of a 20 Km long tunnel and associated works. The tunnelling itself has caused immense damage to the mountainous landscape but as if that was not enough, it has adversely affected the water table and literally shaken the very foundations of buildings and houses in the area. Bandarawela residents have already held a massive demonstration against the project which virtually shut down the entire town.
Hambantota is no doubt an area which suffers from prolonged droughts. It does need a water supply project for irrigation and drinking purposes, but this was perhaps not the best way to go about it. Uma Oya supplied water to the North Central Province in the natural course of events, but that did not matter to the Rajapaksas who lacked the vision to see beyond the confines of Hambantota. There is evidence that they had disregarded the environmental reports and worse, not done any advanced environmental impact assessments on the project in the hurry to add yet another groundbreaking project to their list of accomplishments.
The present Government is now on the horns of a dilemma since the project is almost completed. There are only two options available  suspension or continuation. President Maithripala Sirisena has not hidden the fact that he has always opposed this project and this seems to be the overall sentiment of the Government as well. The attempts being made by certain Opposition figures to pin the blame for Uma Oya on this Government are nothing short of laughable when it is common knowledge that it was started during the previous regime. However, no one dared to protest against the project then due to the white van phenomenon. Now that this Government has created the democratic space for protests, there are daily protests against virtually everything from SAITM to Uma Oya.
Cancelling a project of this magnitude is never easy and the Government has rightly sought expert opinion without necessarily pandering to emotions and populism. A team of Norwegian experts who have knowledge in this topic will examine the project and give their verdict with inputs from the Geological Survey and Mines Bureau and the National Building Research Organisation. The Government is likely to thoroughly assess the benefits: environmental impact ratio in deciding whether to go ahead with the project. The Government has to ensure justice to all the parties concerned in this regard.
The concept of development for the sake of development is mostly dangerous because one tends to sweep the other relevant factors away. Any development project that leads to severe environmental damage is not worth in the long run. This is especially so regarding our picturesque but fragile hill stations which are already feeling the ill effects of climate change. A fault line or a crack in a wall is dangerous anywhere, but it is doubly so in a mountainous locality. And water, another casualty of the Uma Oya project, is a precious resource that we cannot afford to lose.
Uma Oya is a good lesson for lawmakers and development planners on the pitfalls that should be avoided when implementing mega development schemes. No major development project should be implemented without a wide public discourse hereafter.

Weeping at the Heartbreak Ridge
Love and warmth are the strongest attributes that induce people the passion to live and crave for luxuries in life. Eternal love is the most valuable gift for mortals and Gods alike. It is said in the Greek myths; Gods had descended to this world seeking true love.
Shantha Kumara Vithana (Shakuvi), senior journalist, author and poet has written over 100 lyrics to date that have been sung by popular artistes. Shakuvis latest lyric Kandulu Ahawara Vee (After the Tears) revolves around the subject of love and heart-break. Karunaratne Divulgane has rendered voice to the song which is bequeathed with an emotional melody and music by Dr Rohana Weerasinghe.
The song will be uploaded to YouTube soon.
This lyric was originally a poem that I wrote to Sunday Lankadeepa poetry page. Divulgane invited me to make it a lyric and I obliged with pleasure. He has rendered voice to the song in the most emotional and magical manner to highlight the grief of an individual who has lost his love, says Shakuvi.
Divulgane is a difficult customer though. He got me to re-write the lyric several times before doing the final recording at the studio. However the ultimate result was very self satisfying, he added.
Shakuvi writes lyrics with his own experiences and by observing experiences of his peers. He has written lyrics for Visharada Nanda Malini, Lukshman Hewavitharana, Nelu Adhikari, Rohan Shantha Bulegoda and a gamut of other artistes.
Mal Kekulakata sung by Lukshman Hewavitharana became a hit song. There was a craving period for me when popular artistes looked down on me as a lyricist. At a time like that Saman Pathirana was humble enough to render voice to my lyric; Paarami Puranne Nae Ithin, says Shakuvi.
Being a senior journalist, Shakuvi was conferred with a Gold Medal when he completed 15 years of service at Wijeya Newspapers. He is on the verge of completing 25 years and celebrating his Silver Jubilee as a journalist.
At present he is the Features Editor of Sunday Lankadeepa. Shakuvi is married to the famed novelist Chandi Kodikara.

Foreign policy needs restructuring
It is a topical requirement for Sri Lanka to restructure its foreign policy based on a commercial diplomatic system and with a pragmatic approach to tap maximum benefits out of the emerging economic surge in the Asian region, said Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The minister pointed out that for such an approach, he would take action to give priority to obtain the services of young and talented professionals to Sri Lanka Foreign Service.
Foreign Minister Karunanayake expressed these views during his opening address at a conference held under the title Foreign Policies and emerging issues in the Indian Ocean, held at the Lakshman Kadirgamar International Institute, recently.
Minister Karunanayake stated that the economic power is gradually moving from the West towards the East. He explained that China will economically overtake the worlds top economic nation - United States by 2029 and, India would follow suit to overtake Americas economic power by 2050.
The minister said Sri Lankas geographical situation is a natural endowment for the country to exploit benefits from this economic transition. Minister Karunanayake said unprecedented economic potential could be gained in the event we properly manage this strategic geographical situation of Sri Lanka.
Minister Karunanayake stated that digitalization and social media have become popular implements especially among the young generation in the modern world. Although they create some negative effects on certain occasions, without fearing them, and preventing such untoward consequences, these modern advents should be used as precious resources to increase the countrys economic growth, he said.
The minister who explained how Sri Lankas foreign policy should respond to these activities said China has already invested US$1.5 billion in this country. He said India has also pledged to invest US$1 billion in Sri Lanka and several other countries including Japan have consented to invest in the island.
Under these positive circumstances, our country has meagerly responded to such prospective neighboring countries and other countries that are willing to bring investment.
We should not wait sluggishly until some benefits are automatically reached to our country subsequent to the economic power transition from the West to the East. The main role of the diplomatic missions of Sri Lankan is to utilize this great opportunity and help this effort which is aimed to tap maximum economic benefits, he said.
Therefore, it is appropriate to promote dual identity for Sri Lanka in the global arena; one is to promote the country as the centre of the Indian Ocean and, the other as it is the gateway to the Sub Continent. Building a dual identity is not only a commercial effort. The Commercial Diplomacy of Sri Lanka should be designed on a clear and stable policy planning. That should be strong enough to face the existing crises in the region as well as other international security disputes. We should come to an agreement with the partners who are working with us in order to make it a success, the minister said.
Foreign Affairs Minister Karunanayake stated that factors such as international law and the respect to laws relating to naval freedom for transport could not be disturbed due to economic development. He said as one step towards managing such situations properly, President Maithripala Sirisena signed Jakarta Agreement last March and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe signed another agreement on Behavioural pattern of military vessels in the Indian Ocean.
Foreign diplomats, economic experts, scholars and Executive Director of Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute Dr. Dinusha Panditharathna and others were present.

No human body parts dumped with waste: Faiszer

Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha denied the claim that human body parts have been mixed with the waste dumped at Muthurajawela, today in Parliament.
The Minister replying to a question by MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardena said that human body parts from hospitals and mortuaries are being incinerated by health authorities at incineration plants in Welisara.
He also said that the Government plans to construct a sanitary landfill and compost plant at Muthurajawela.
Another sanitary landfill would come up in Aruwakkalu in Puttalam with trans-substation and railway connectivity, he said.
As an immediate measure my ministry is carrying out a detailed survey of existing dump sites to see the possibility of converting them to environmentally friendly sanitary landfills. We need to resolve land issues and construct at least two sanitary landfills in every district. We have planned to purchase 100 garbage compactors from local funds and another 151 from Korean soft loans to improve waste transportation facilities of LG authorities, he explained.
The Minister said a taskforce will be set up in his Ministry to monitor waste management activities in Colombo and suburbs.
We will prepare a waste collection and disposal master plan for each province with the support of all stakeholders. We will hand over the summary of the report to the President on July 17, the Minister added.
The Minister noted three waste to energy plants would be set up at Karadiyana, Muthurajawela and Moratuwa with the help of other stakeholder ministries for waste being generating in Colombo metropolitan area and Gampaha district.

## Title: The 1930s like no other

The 1930s like no other
On February 4, 1948, Ceylon embraced Independence albeit with Dominion status. D S Senanayake, the first Prime Minister of Independent Ceylon, attired in the western suit, addressed the Parliament, the legislature that still communicated in English, the language of the colonial masters.
What came to pass on February 4 ruled a whole decade of incidents in Sri Lanka. The forties decade is marked with importance because an independent country was offered to the Ceylonese occupants.
We have evolved seven decades following Independence, apparently not without turbulences. Does that reflection of what happened over the past seven decades help us understand where we are headed Probably not! Or probably yes! Ruwanthie de Chickera is concerned about it more than any of us.
That concern  or interest, rather  has led de Chickera to view the decade as a generation. She has approached the individuals born in the 1930s as a periscope to view the turbulences in a fresh angle.
Those born in the 1930s are a unique generation. Even in the world, they remain unique because they witnessed crucial events of world history. In Sri Lanka, they are an interesting generation because they were born during the colonisation. Then they remember the end of colonisation. They remember how things proceeded after the British colonisation ended, de Chickera anatomises her justification.
And that journey is given a title: Dear Children Sincerely, a theatre production that goes on board on July 5 and 7 at the Lionel Wendt.
Following the thirties, quite a few countries were born. The majority of the people born during this period feel as if they have been suddenly given a country. More importantly, they remember socialism unlike those who were born post-1980s.
They are the children of socialism. They believed in that. This country had faith in the Left. It is the Left that was interested in gaining freedom too, de Chickera adds.
Once capitalism entered, nothing could exist. It has destroyed everything. But the thirties generation has shards of that beautiful memory. What matters the most is that they witnessed the key episode of Sri Lanka, gaining Independence. Then they were the spectacle to what came to pass in the country for the first ten years  The Sinhala-only policy, for instance, and so on.
They saw everything happen for the first time. The first anti-Tamil riots, for one. The Sinhala-only as well as its offshoot, the 71 insurrection. They have a better understanding of how these things happened, de Chickera examines.
With that background, they entered the 80s to observe a new phenomenon. That was the period when the open economy was making waves in the country and shifting the priorities of the ordinary common life from simplistic to a materialistic one. De Chickera identifies 1983 as the phase when violence was allowed in the open.
One ethnic group began to feel they are powerful, while another began to feel alienated. And politicians supported this for the first time. It is that culture that resulted in everything followed: selfishness, insularity, materialism, corruption and narrow education system, she lists an inventory.
The decade was full of happenings. De Chickera looks at them as the circumstances that governed the country more than being a mere menace or conflict. We cannot judge ourselves right now, but we can always reflect on our childhood.
The Sinhala-only policy launched during the late fifties led to a youth insurgency in the seventies. It gave birth to a generation of Sinhala-educated crowd struggling to find some placement in the employment sector. Then there was conflict.
In this project what we do is let the 30s generation reflect countrys journey. You cannot understand where things went wrong or right. I thought its good to capture that perspective. On the other hand, it is good to approach the younger generation. Our younger audience, especially the Sinhala (and may be the Tamils in the north as well) have no real sense of history. They have no idea about the history of other communities of this country. If they are engaged in some political party, they know some history of their party. But I know the people aged between the 20s and 30s who are clueless about what happened in 1983.
Ruwanthie accredits that unawareness to the local education system which does not focus much on modern history. On the other hand, the average youth have more problems, especially financial, to deal with and hardly any time to explore other subjects.
We do not try to cover the whole story from the 1940s up to date. We have interviewed 70 people and transcribed their views. Most stories are not more than five minutes. But each story is complete. We have a basket full of these stories. We can create many stories if we like. These are performed as a standalone. One segment is on the Sinhala-only.
Finally, the team links all such stories to consummate the production.
The research has given something important to each generation. The Independence governed the 1940s. The Sinhala-only emerged in the late 50s. That was to be followed by a military coup attempt in the 1960s, which indicated the distancing of the Christian English speaking elite from the power. The 1970s and the 1980s saw insurrections and riots respectively. Although the 1990s was a bloodshed history marked with numerous assassinations caused by the LTTE, Sri Lanka marked its presence in the global context by winning the Cricket World Cup in 1996. Come 2000, and behold the Menik Farm following the end of the war.
So much to happen over a matter of seven decades!
Dear Children Sincerely will be a new experience to the local audience in its attempt to devise theatre in the form of an ensemble. The director does not command. As Akalanka, an actor, puts it, the director employs the cast to get the best out of them.
We do not act according to a pre-written script. We write on the sets. We do music, though there is a musician. We all do everything. Director listens to us and vice versa, Akalanka explains.
Seven Decades of Sri Lanka on stage at the Wendt
Directed by Ruwanthie de Chickera, Dear Children Sincerely highlights seven singular events that changed the course of Sri Lankas history and will be performed at the Lionel Wendt on July 5 and 6 at 7 pm.
The play is a highly-charged ensemble performance that takes the audience on a journey through seventy years of Sri Lankas recent history. The piece was created through conversations with senior citizens born in the 1930s, and through their stories, traces the dramatic socio-political journey of the Sri Lankan people, from Independence in the 1940s to the end of the war in 2009.
The play is written and directed by Ruwanthie de Chickera and was devised with an ensemble group of artists comprising well-established actors and talented newcomers. The play explores how history evolves, and how memory works; focussing on what people retain, how they retain it, what gets carried on and why things get erased.
Performances devised under the DCS project -- starting from 2015 -- have toured within and outside Sri Lanka. The first DCS show was on Sri Lankan and Rwandan histories and was staged in Kigali at the Ubumuntu Arts Festival in 2015. DCS shows have since toured in Kerala, Jammu, New Delhi and Mumbai. Performances have also taken place in Ireland and the UK and were adopted by ASHTAR  the Theatre International Youth Festival, Palestine in 2016.

Ranawaka stressed that SAITM should be legally abolished as a permanent measure and not as a temporary one pending the Supreme Court decision. completely abolished. Minister Ranawaka emphasised the necessity of ensuring justice for the students recruited for the medical degree the during past eight years. He further stressed that the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should prepare a special mechanism to provide facilities for SAITM students who have qualified with the required z-score level to follow a medical degree in Sri Lanka to become a doctor after completing their degree. Students who have not qualified to follow a medical degree should be directed to follow any other courses or measures should be taken to teimburse their money.
The Minister proposed to use the SAITM building and other facilities for the Medical Faculty which has already been proposed to be established by the University of Moratuwa.
Minister Ranawaka said that it was fruitless to to continue with SAITM by seeking taking court orders, since this has already become a major issue.
Minister Ranawaka charged that some political forces are attempting to gain political mileage from this issue.
Even former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is also attempting to do that, Minister Ranawaka said.
Around 7,000 students currently studying at government medical faculties have boycotted lectures for about six to seven months. Around 1,600 students who have completed their final year examinations are waiting for their clinical training while another 1,600 students are currently receiving clinical training at government hospitals, the Minister said.
Another 1,600 students who completed their clinical training are now waiting their appointments. Nearly 12,000 students who have entered government medical faculties after obtaining the best results at the O/L and A/L examinations under very competitive circumstances expect to be a doctor. Therefore, everyone should talk more about the fate of these 12,000 students than 1000 students studying at SAITM, Minister Ranawaka said.
He further claimed that the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is a powerful professional association with a large number of medical professionals.
The SLMC has the legal authority to regulate medical education in the country. Therefore,the government should immdiately come to an agreement with the SLMC to solve this issue.
The SAITM issue cannot be solved on the streets or at hospitals and it can only be solved through a transparent agreement between the Government and the SLMC followed by a in depth analysis of the issue, the Minister said.
Minister Ranawaka charged that the architect of SAITM was former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
When I opposed the establishment of SAITM in 2012,the former President asked me to discuss the matter with then Higher Education Minister S.B Dissanayake, claiming that it was the Higher Education Ministers decision.Then I met Minister S.B.Dissanayake at his home and we discussed the matter with him for a long time. I then realised that the SAITM was established as a sample medical faculty to determine the social response with the intention of establishing three more medical faculties for Basil, Gotabhaya and Namal, Minister Ranawaka alleged.
The Minister further revealed that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa paid a large amount of compensation by bringing the Military Hospital to the premises where SAITM owner Neville Fernandos Central Hospital was situated.
The Narahenpita Military Hospital was expanded. After that, Neville Fernando sold his land.A Rs.600 million loan was granted to Neville Fernando by the Bank of Ceylon,Minister Ranawaka said. This is how Mahinda extended political support for the establishment of SAITM, Minister Ranawaka alleged.
This issue should be solved by protecting the countrys free education system, he said.
The SAITM issue cannot be solved only through a legal procedure since it has become a social and political issue in the country. This issue could result in a tragedy like what we eperienced in 88/89. Therefore, we urge the President and the Prime Minister to come to an immediate agreement with the SLMC without putting the doctors, students and the whole country in to trouble, Minister Ranawaka added.

After Kamal Haasan, Vijay Sethupathi : is a brilliant co-star
While multi-starrer films are a rarity in Tamil cinema, Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi have worked together in Vikram Vedha, a gangster film set in North Chennai.
Ahead of the release of the film, Madhavan has lavished praise on his co-star, Vijay Sethupathi and said he began his friendship with the latter over a smoke.
Speaking at Vikram Vedha press meet on Wednesday, Madhavan said, Ive worked with some of the big names in Indian cinema like Kamal Haasan and Amitabh Bachchan. I would say Vijay Sethupathi is a brilliant and intelligent actor to work with after Kamal Haasan. We have also become cigarette buddies, said Madhavan.
It must be noted that superstar Shah Rukh Khan released the trailer of Vikram Vedha on Twitter. Madhavan said that the Hindi belt is raving about Vikram Vedha and that he would loved to take the film to Bollywood.
Yes, my friends from Bollywood have watched the trailer and praised Vijay Sethupathi and music composer Sam. I would loved to take the film there (Bollywood). Since Vikram Vedha is completely set in North Chennai, Im not sure how to tweak it to match their sensibilities, he added.
Apart from Madhavan and Vijay Sethupathi, the film also stars Shraddha Srinath, Kathir and Varalakshmi Sarathkumar in pivotal roles. Vikram Vedha is directed by duo- Pushkar and Gayathri, and is slated to release on July 7.

Atapattu scored one of the best hundreds youll ever see anywhere in cricket
When I was young and getting involved in cricket, my heroes tended to be from the mens teams because you just didnt see womens matches on the TV. Its great now that all these ICC Womens World Cup 2017 games are televised and the social media coverage has been brilliant.
Its been lovely to see that the talk hasnt been all about England and everyone has been loving watching Smriti Mandhana score runs for India, Chamari Atapattus amazing hundred and celebrating everybodys achievements. There are so many role models for young girls to take to their hearts.
Ive been so impressed by the crowds at this World Cup. I wondered before the tournament started how well attended the non-England games would be and having been down at Taunton for the Australia versus West Indies match and then watched the West Indies versus India game on the TV, I was so pleased to see the big crowds there. There were lots of school children at the grounds and there is a real and growing excitement about watching the womens game.
I was at Leicester on Tuesday for Englands game against Pakistan and there was nearly a full house, loads of youngsters and a real good atmosphere. Thats what we want - all the teams playing in front of good crowds and for them to appreciate the standard of cricket on show. Ive been out into the crowds and talked to a lot of the kids and you can see the excitement in their faces. Its quite a thing for a young kid to go home to their parents and say theyve been to a World Cup game.
You cant put a price on having a World Cup in your own country. Its pretty special and you really sense that exuberant mood when you are at the grounds. One of the big objectives of this World Cup was to leave a legacy and you do feel we are creating something really special.
The players have put in some unbelievable performances so far. Atapattu scored one of the best hundreds youll ever see anywhere in cricket and everyone suddenly sat up and realised how brilliant this World Cup is. For Atapattu as an individual, that knock could change her life with the Womens Big Bash League and the Kia Super League contracts up for grabs and other opportunities. Its great to see players performing on the biggest stage and appreciate the rewards they will get for their hard work.
In years gone by you probably wouldnt have been able to see Atapattus innings unless youd been at the ground, but with this tournaments high profile we are all able to see how good she was. Ten years ago you might have been able to see the scorecard, if you were lucky.
In womens cricket, we all knew that she is a quality player, but for her to score 178 not out wasnt just sensational, but she did it against Australia and got 68% of the sides runs in the process  it was one of the best innings youll see. The ball was going so far over the boundary rope and thats one of the things that has stood out for me in this tournament  how far the girls are hitting their shots.
It seems like weve seen more hundreds already in this World Cup than we have in whole tournaments in the past. Mandhanas hundred for India has probably been a bit overshadowed by Atapattus. And then Meg Lanning scoring a hundred as Australia beat Sri Lanka to ensure Atapattus heroics were in vain and hardly anyone is talking about that. And everyone seems to have already forgotten about Nat Sciver and Heather Kinghts wonderful hundreds for England. The performances are coming so thick and fast, the standard is really high and were moving on so quickly from one great achievement to the next. Im so looking forward to every game to come.
Sri Lanka worried Australia the other day, has put itself into positions to win games and has definitely done a lot better than I thought.
India has been the team of the tournament for me so far and itll be looking to continue its good run of form. Theyll be brilliant games to play in for those players. I dont think people from outside of India and Pakistan quite understand the rivalry between those countries until we see it up close and witness how important that game is to the players and how highly the countries regard that fixture. Im sure everyone will be tuned in to the TV coverage and it will be great to see what viewing figures they get because it will be one of the biggest games of the tournament.
Im absolutely loving this World Cup and the high quality cricket weve seen. Now theyve all played a couple of games and its good to see how the table is shaping up. There are some huge matches coming up over the next 10 days. You want to see the best players in the world put into pressure games and situations and to see who comes out on top. Thats what the viewers want to see and there is plenty of opportunity to do just that over the next couple of weeks as we see who manages to reach the semi-finals.  ICC news
