Review new ways of sharing in a hurting world: Prime Minister
The thrice blessed day of Vesak dawns with spiritual significance for all Buddhists. In observing Vesak, we find the time to engage in activities of piety and sharing of alms with those in need, stated Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in a message marking Vesak.
The message added: Sri Lanka has been home to the tenants of Theravada Buddhism for centuries. For us, it is indeed a blessed occasion to be able to host two significant events in the international Buddhist calendar. The 14th United Nations International Vesak Celebrations and the Global Buddhist Forum are due to be held in Sri Lanka to coincide with the sacred period of Vesak.
The precepts of Buddhism based on the concept of universal compassion (maithri), should inspire us to include its philosophical application in everyday living, while also reviewing new ways of sharing it with a hurting world.
This would indeed be one key opportunity presented to us during the International Vesak Celebrations.
May all beings be happy and content as we come together to commemorate the blessed Day of Vesak, the release stated.

Sagala calls for report on Piliyandala shooting

Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake has asked IGP Pujith Jayasundara for a report on the shooting of the officers from the Anti-Narcotics Unit in Piliyandala last night.
A group on motorbikes has open fired at the policemen while they were conducting a raid to apprehend 10kg of drugs from drug dealers in the area.
Yesterday night, a team from the Anti-narcotics Unit were at the Peoples Bank on Moratuwa road, Piliyandala when the policemen were shot at by a group of unidentified men. A police officer was killed in the incident and one sustained serious injuries.
The shooting had also injured four others which included an eight-year-old girl and a fifteen-year-old boy. 
With policemen being shot at, the Minister has asked for a report from the IGP as to why the team had undertaken the raid with little preparation and why they chose to go ahead with the raid under such circumstances. The IGP is to submit a report within three days.
The IGP has appointed Senior Deputy IGP M.R. Lathief on the case.
In the meantime, the police has discovered an abandoned motorbike in the Maharagama police division but said they could not confirm whether it was linked to the shooting.

SC extends stay on cutting down Pannipitiya Bo-Tree
The Supreme Court yesterday further extended its Interim Order suspending the Road Development Authority (RDA) Chairman from cutting down or removing a Bo-Tree close to the border of the Colombo-Avissavella Road in Pannipitiya until June 13.
Two-Judge-Bench comprising Chief Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Upaly Abeyratne made this order pursuant to a Fundamental Right petition filed by four petitioners, including Ven. Weraduwe Sirijothi Thera of Sri Punnyabiwardanaramaya in Kottawa. Meanwhile, the court was informed through the Attorney General that the authorities have made arrangements to provide a solution to the issue.
The petitioners had cited the Higher Education and Highways Minister, the Maharagama Divisional Secretary, the RDA Chairman, Attorney General and several others as respondents.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel M. Thilakaratne appearing on behalf of the petitioners had informed Court that the history of the Pannipitiya Bo-Tree runs back to about 400 years.
The petitioners stated that in 2015, the RDA tried to cut down the Bo-Tree to develop the High-level Road. The move was defeated by public protest.
The petitioners said the Bo-Tree is bearing its own history and has become part of the tradition and culture of the Buddhists and practices relating to Buddhism.
The Supreme Court granted leave to proceed with the petition and fixed the matter for argument on June 13.

Sex: Oppressed and Obsessed
Though Sri Lanka might not seem sex-obsessed, data from Google Trends released last December revealed that the island topped the list of countries that searched the word sex in 2016. It was the fifth year in a row that Sri Lanka placed first on the list.
South Asia was well represented, as Bangladesh, Nepal, and India placed 3rd, 4th, and 5th, respectively.
Madusha Dissanayake
The data does not reveal the websites Internet users visit after the original Google search, so it is largely unclear if people are looking at pornography or simply trying to access information. It is likely, however, that people are accessing a mixture of porn and info.
The searches peaked in August and December, months where children are on school holidays, which leads most to believe children and teenagers are significantly involved in the issue.
But what is it about developing South Asian countries, and especially Sri Lanka, that makes them prime global googlers of questionable content
Myriad sexuality and health experts, as well as academics and doctors, worry that the data reveals heretofore hidden truths about Sri Lankan culture and educational systems, not least of which is the pervasiveness of a sexual repression.
Whereas most Western, as well as several East Asian countries have undergone varying degrees of sexual liberation over the years, Sri Lanka, and South Asia in general, is lagging behind in this regard. Social and sexual conservatism is still prevalent, if not ubiquitous, in society.
Sex is, to a great extent, taboo in Sri Lanka. Parents are not open with their children about the issue, and it is rare for families to speak about sex, said Dr. N. Kumaranayake, a clinical psychiatrist at the Kiribathgoda Government Base Hospital.
Lack of openness on sexual issues
Dr. Ajith Karawita, consultant in STDs and HIV medicine at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital, argued that the expression of sexuality is very much controlled in Sri Lankan society.
It is very difficult to express ones sexuality to another person or with another person, so young people are turning to the Internet for both pleasure and information. There is little space for this expression, and society is keeping it that way, he said.
Because young people are behind many of the Google searches, as experts surmise, it follows that parents might not be doing enough to educate and inform their children about sex and sexuality.
Kumaranayake highlighted a troubling behavioural pattern in Sri Lankan parents that hinders them from fully engaging with their children: authoritarian-type behaviour.
Authoritarian-type behaviour is such that parents provide their children with material goods and instruct and discipline them. But they are not emotionally close with their children and do not aim to be, he said.
Madusha Dissanayake, Director Public Affairs, Policy and Advocacy at the Family Planning Association, also critiqued parents for not fully understanding their childrens knowledge base on issues related to sex and sexuality.
We think children think the way we think and sometimes, know some of what we know, she said, while adding that this disconnect further inhibits emotional bonding between parents and children.
A lack of emotional connectivity can, according to Kumaranayake, lead to stress and anxiety in children, which they then seek to rid themselves of. Furthermore, because they cannot talk to their parents or elders about sex, kids and teenagers turn to peers and the web for information and, shall we say, demonstrations.
Dissanayake also noted that adolescents face a particularly confusing situation, as they are programmed to repress any sexual urges by both their parents and society.
The culture we live in leads parents to think its not right or decent to think or talk about pleasure. Children and teens get sexual feelings that feel good, but the rest of society says these feelings are bad, so they dont know what to think or do, she said.
This confusion is compounded by the brain and personality development that children undergo between the ages of 10 to 18. During these critical years, kids have poor impulse control and decision-making skills, and they often cannot control their emotions or desires, according to Kumaranayake.
The cut-throat and nature of Sri Lankan school life and jam-packed schedules, certainly do not help the situation. Stress is, according to the experts, one of the central factors that leads children to access sexual content on the web.
15-year-olds spend their lives in school and at tuition classes that leave little time for relaxation and entertainment. There is not a lot of time available to share feelings or hang out with friends, so they are turning to these newer forms of entertainment that are easily accessible, Kumaranayake said.
Though those consulted for this article expressed slightly varying takes on the roots of this issue, they all agreed that curiosity and want of information are central to any explanation of the matter.
We see curiosity, frustration and interest among children and adults about the notions of sex and sexuality. And we definitely have an issue where people need to receive correct information that they currently are not getting from their parents or schools, said Dissanayake.
Trouble with Sex Education
Parents certainly play a role in educating their children on sexual matters, but schools should also shoulder a good portion of the burden. Unfortunately, sex education courses are not currently performing their tasks properly.
At fault for hindering sexual education is a combination of poor teacher training, a lack of access to classes, and the widespread culture of shame surrounding discussions of sex and sexuality.
Dr. N. Kumaranayake
Even though the classes are designed to provide a lot of information on sexual and reproductive health, few teachers really follow the curricula. I think teachers individual perspectives on sex and their attitudes and beliefs hinder the whole implementation of the courses, she said.Dissanayake pointed out that much of the curricula is not being taught because teachers are embarrassed when or incapable of instructing students on issues relating to sex and sexuality.
So many sex education teachers are shy and embarrassed when discussing the subject they are supposed to teach. They dont talk openly about it and often tell children what they believe rather than scientific facts, said Kumaranayake.
That teachers do not always conduct lessons based on facts, adds to the propagation of sexual myths, which further confuse children and lead to poor sexual health practices, he further noted.
It is no secret, moreover, that many of the teachers are not properly trained, but this, according to Dissanayake, is a secondary issue, since she thinks that teachers would still be too shy to teach the material that they have learned.
Even if teachers have had some intro or training in sexuality education, I dont think many would feel confident enough to teach the information in the correct manner. Perhaps they would go over the two reproductive systems, but they would most likely not cover correct sexual health and protection matters or discuss healthy relationship, she said.
Adding to this problem is that most schools teach an abstinence-centric sexual health and education curriculum that rarely, if ever, covers the details of contraception.
But even the rare school that boasts a competent sexual education programme might not teach many students due to the fact that the classes are no longer compulsory for older students.
Sex education not mandatory in schools
Karawita said that many children take courses that include some sexual education in 7th, 8th, and 9th grades. Dissanayake stated that health courses in most schools are not mandatory and that many students receive next to no sex and sexuality education.
Unfortunately many students go through school without learning about these important matters, and then they are expected to get married and have a fabulous life. Thats not usually how things go, she said, while advocating for improved instruction in building and maintaining healthy relationships.
As long as there is a culture of shame surrounding sex, young people, who do not receive adequate schooling in sex and sexuality, will continue to look to the web for information and pleasure.
It would be better, the experts said, if students got their information from reliable sources rather than the Internet, which, as we all know, is rife with misinformation. That being said, students can still glean information from the web.
This phenomenon stems from factors in our society, and only through engaging with society will we be able to properly educate the people on sexual health issues, said Dissanayake.

South Korea's Moon Jae-in sworn in vowing to address North

South Korea's new leader Moon Jae-in has been sworn in, vowing to address the economy and relations with the North in his first speech as president.
He said that he would even be willing to visit Pyongyang under the right circumstances.
Moon took his oath of office in Seoul's National Assembly building a day after his decisive win.
The former human rights lawyer and son of North Korean refugees is known for his liberal views.
Tensions on the Korean peninsula remain high and recent weeks have seen the US and Pyongyang trade angry rhetoric as speculation about another nuclear test grows.
Moon has also vowed to unify a divided country reeling froma corruption scandalwhich saw his predecessor, Park Geun-hye, impeached.
In his inauguration speech, Moon said he would "do everything I can to build peace on the Korean peninsula".
"If needed I will fly to Washington immediately," he said. "I will also go to Beijing and Tokyo and even Pyongyang in the right circumstances."
He added that he would have "serious negotiations" with the US and China over the controversial deployment of anti-missile system Thaad.
North Korea has yet to officially comment on Moon's victory and remarks. It had previously hinted that Moon was its preferred candidate.
The 64-year-old Democratic Party candidate has also promised to bolster the economy and address youth unemployment, which are key concerns for voters.
Who is Moon
The son of refugees from North Korea, Moon served in South Korea's special forces before becoming a human rights lawyer.
Advocates greater dialogue with the North while maintaining pressure and sanctions, in contrast to his predecessor.
Wants to reform South Korea's family-run conglomerates, known as chaebols, which dominate the economy
Jailed while a student in the 1970s for leading protests against military ruler Park Chung-hee, Park's father.
He was a top aide to former liberal President Roh Moo-hyun.
Who is South Korea's new president
Moon has been critical of the two previous conservative administrations, which took a hard-line stance against Pyongyang, for failing to stop North Korea's weapons development.
Since the Korean War ended in an armistice in 1953, there have only been two summits where the leaders of the two Koreas have met, both held in Pyongyang.
Moon spearheaded preparations for the second meeting in 2007, when serving as a presidential aide.
The US, South Korea's most important ally, has congratulated Moon on his victory.
White House press secretary Sean Spicer said the US looked forward to continuing to "strengthen the alliance" and "deepen the enduring friendship and partnership".
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said their countries faced common challenges "led by responses to the North Korean issue" but they could "further contribute to peace and prosperity of the region by working together".
President Xi Jinping said he "always attaches great importance to the relationship between China and South Korea", and that he was "willing to diligently work with" with Moon to ensure both countries benefit, reported Chinese state news agency Xinhua.
Final results show Moon took 41.1% of thevote on Tuesday, while conservative candidate Hong Joon-pyo took 25.5%.
Centrist Ahn Cheol-soo, widely seen as a strong contender, came third with 21.4%.

Sri Lanka must improve economic management, governance: CB Governor
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday warned that Sri Lanka would be shut off from international capital markets if it did not improve its economic management and governance.
There is a much higher premium attached to some economic management and governance at present than in the past, explained the Governor as he delivered the key note address at the launch of the Economic and Social Survey of Asia and the Pacific 2017: Governance and Fiscal Management Report by the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute yesterday. He went on to further explain that though the countrys economy had run an exceedingly high budget deficit every single year since 1987, the graduation of the economy to lower middle income status in 2010 meant that the inflow of foreign aid and concessionary loans which kept us afloat all those years was starting to dry up.
At the same time we now have access to international capital markets. In 2010, we were fortunate as that was also the time that major international central banks were flushing in large amounts of liquidity into the commercial system. At that time, we had negligible amounts of commercial borrowings, so we aggressively borrowed but on the economic governance side we did not screen the projects as we could have done and the rates of return have been somewhat disappointing, Coomaraswamy said.
He added that with access to international capital markets came exposure to rating agencies which were at times harsher than the IMF, If we dont have economic governance, we will be cut off from funding and we have to go to international markets for funding and to pay off our debts,the Central Bank Governor explained.
To bring about more consistent and predictable economic policies which are key for growth, the Central Bank he said was putting in pace frameworks for macroeconomic policy formulation,
Since liberalisation of the economy, we have had repeating cycles of stockbroker policies where we artificially create growth which is not sustained through investments. This is done by pumping money through the budget, keeping interest rates artificially low, keeping the exchange rates over valued to suck in imports. You can do that for a year or two but then you have the crunch, a large budget deficit, balance of payment problems and inflation goes up, said the Governor as he explained that their fiscal framework based on recommendations from the IMF extended fund facility would target a budget deficit of 4.6 percent of GDP at the end of this year and a target of 3.6 percent by 2020, he said.
We will follow a monetary policy framework which will have a flexible inflation target and a proactive look to monetary policy. With the exchange rate we will no longer try to balance it by spending our limited foreign reserves. In 2011-2012, USD 4 billion was spent on it but the rupee depreciated by 14 percent. In 2015, the government spent USD 2 billion and it still depreciated by 10 percent. So we will only try to smoothen any speculation or wild fluctuations, otherwise it will be managed flexible and gradually brought down, Coomaraswamy said.
He also stressed that the main adjustments to the economy would be revenue focused,
There is no longer a risk premium attached to our economy due to the conflict so the government will in future only provide incentives related to upfront investments. And we will also look to change the revenue composition and the Prime Minister hopes in the immediate future to change the indirect to direct tax composition to 60: 40 from 80: 20.
Overall government expenditure which has stood at 20 percent of GDP, said the Governor was not high but there were issues in relation to the composition and quality of the expenditure which has had disappointing returns.
The UN ESCAP report this year highlighted that many of the economies in the Asia and Pacific region were moving towards domestic demand driven growth rather than growth driven by external demand but Sri Lanka has chosen to focus on external growth,
The biggest indictment of past policies that it has allowed our exports and tradeable goods sector to be halved. We need to have a strategy of a growth model based on private sector led, exports driven growth with a large component from FDIs, he said and added that the government did not have the fiscal space to take on more borrowing to drive development.
Our location and excellent international relations can trump the head wings coming from the global economy. But we need to get right; our policy framework, macroeconomic policy framework, investment climate, investment policy, trade policy and trade presentation. If we can bring all this together and the government is trying to do that, we in Sri Lanka can go with a growth model based on external demand, said an optimistic Governor.

Sri Lankan in Canada found guilty of second-degree murder
Thandapanithesigar, a Sri Lankan in Canada, was originally charged with first-degree murder, but the jury found him guilty of the lesser charge late Monday afternoon. It meant the jury was probably not convinced he planned the murder even though they heard evidence that a week before the murder was carried out, the victim had made unwelcome advances on Thandapanithesigars wife.
Thandapanithesigar was guilty of second-degree murder for having stabbed his neighbour in Cte-des-Neiges.
During his trial, Thandapanithesigar admitted he stabbed Jeyarasan Manikarajah on June 23, 2014. But he testified that he stabbed the victim in a fit of anger after the victim called him several names during an argument, including a vulgar term for vagina in their shared Sri Lankan language.
The presiding judge in the trial, Jean-Franois Buffoni, asked the seven men and five women if they could reach a unanimous decision on a sentence recommendation. While Thandapanithesigar automatically received a life sentence with the murder conviction, his parole eligibility can be set at anywhere between 10 and 25 years. The jury foreman told Buffoni that the majority of the jurors recommended the parole eligibility be set at the 10-year minimum but that a few disagreed. One juror felt Thandapanithesigars eligibility should be set at the maximum, 25 years. Defence lawyer Elise Pinsonneault asked that the jury be asked individually if they all agreed with the second-degree verdict.
At least two of the jurors wont stop crying, Pinsonneault said. They keep looking me in the face, with a look of distress.
When each juror was asked individually, they all said they agree with the verdict. Juror number 12, the same man who recommended Thandapanithesigar serve the maximum 25 years before he is eligible for full parole, hesitated a long time before he uttered agree. It was a sign that the juror was a holdout and was initially convinced Thandapanithesigar was guilty of first-degree murder. Jury deliberations are secret in Canada so it is impossible to know how the decision was reached.
Buffoni will hear arguments on Thandapanithesigars parole eligibility on May 29.

Ties beyond trade
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe recently concluded a working visit to India, which is followed by the arrival of Prime Minister Modi as the guest of honour for the opening of the UN Vesak celebrations in Sri Lanka. That Prime Minister Modi has agreed to grace the UN Vesak celebrations in Sri Lanka, despite the lack of a significant Buddhist constituency in his own country, is a tribute by him to Sri Lankas own unique Buddhist heritage, with its origins in India.
India has in more recent years, increased its focus on the fact, that it is not only the cradle of one of the worlds major faiths, Hinduism, but also the birthplace of another of the worlds major religions, Buddhism, which in its purer Theravada form, is now mainly practiced in Myanmar, Thailand and Sri Lanka.
However, the real story of Indo-Sri Lanka relations under the Sirisena / Wickremesinghe Administration lay in the MOU that was signed in Delhi during Prime Minister Wickremesinghes visit there in late April.
The MOU achieved some aspects, though not the full extent of what the original Economic and Trade Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) was intending to do, laying the groundwork and creating the basis for Indian investment in Sri Lanka. Many of the aspects which certain professional groups objected to, including the easier entry of Indian professionals in to our labour market were left out of the MOU, though the agreement leaves open the possibility to expand the scope of the MOU at a later date.
Joint Oppositions Xenophobia vs Racism
The Joint Opposition backing defeated President Rajapaksa, has since its electoral defeat been seeking a political slogan and platform on which to make a political comeback. A comeback, which Rajapaksa now seems to believe is only two moons away. Notwithstanding that claim, the JOs political messaging is important if its justified claims to being the alternative to the rainbow coalition is accepted. The die-hard loyalists of the defeated Rajapaksa regime, never really abandoned the barely disguised and thinly veiled racism which was its stock in trade at both the elections of 2015, in which it lost, much to their own surprise.
A racism which ensured, as some counting agents personally reported, that in some minority polling stations, especially in Muslim areas, every single vote went to President Sirisena and none to Rajapaksa, a unique first in Sri Lankas electoral history. The JOs strident majoritarian ethno-nationalism having a resonance and appeal solely with a section of the majority community and none other. Unable to come up with any other rationale for its existence, the Rajapaksas and the JO are intent on flogging the war victory for electoral gain, a strategy which failed them in 2015 and likely fail them again in the future.
Defeated President Rajapaksa, being a shrewd politician has recognized that he does need some minority support if his political project is to ever move from a very well-funded opposition project (no prizes for guessing their source of funds) to one which enjoys electoral victory in the future.
Accordingly, he is personally trying to reach out to minorities, but sending Gotabhaya to Durga Town, Aluthgama may be more like rubbing salt in the wound, while parading former LTTE leader and criminally accused Karuna on the front stages of the Joint Opposition platform, is hardly an appeal to the Tamil people.
The alternative for targeting the perceived enemy within and engaging in the fear and hate mongering which is its stock in trade, especially the minor allies of the JO, who though the tail, seemingly wag the JO dog, has been xenophobia or attempts at whipping up anti-Indian sentiment. Much to their chagrin, this also does not seem to have got much traction in the South, while it hardly has any currency at all in the North and East.
Its the economy and reforms
The Yahapalanaya Administration received its mandate for reforms, democratic, economic and reconciliation reforms. At the end of its term and indeed at any Provincial or Local elections which intervene and we do have Provincial elections due towards the end of this calendar year, this government would be judged on whether it delivered on those promises to the people. While the easy wins of the first one hundred day programme was perhaps largely achieved and the enviable 19th Amendment and the RTI Act, passed much more needs to be done to fulfil the expectations of the electorate. A key aspect of that is economic reforms.
The defeated Rajapaksa Administration left the incoming Good Governance Administration with a mountain of debt, both foreign and domestic, spent on dubious projects together with massive corruption. Leaving the incoming administration with very little wiggle room for fiscal stimulation or trying to spend its way out of a slowing down economy. We also continue to be burdened by huge military spending. A rather surprising feature of our peace, being that we have higher military spending in our post war period than we did fighting the war.
With not much room left for government capital expenditure, the only other source of funds is foreign investment and as Western economies slow down and go through political transformations of their own, from Brexit to the bring jobs back to America campaign of the Trump Administration, Sri Lanka should in its own rationale interest seek to exploit and benefit from the expanding economies in its own region and India is an economic powerhouse next door, from which we must benefit and profit. Sri Lanka attracts abysmal levels of foreign direct investment (FDI) and one method of increasing confidence of private investors in our economy, is to have greater and profitable investments by foreign governments.
The Indian MOU largely lays out cooperation by India, actually investment by them, mostly in Sri Lankas energy (power) sector, a crucial requirement for every other industry including households to function. The transitioning of our national power generation from the traditional thermal and hydro, to other alternative and renewable forms of energy, including solar and natural gas is a welcome development. Increased Indian investment into Sri Lankas roads, highways and the power sector is perhaps just the prescription our economy needs to move up a notch or two.

Trump fires FBI Chief Comey

US President Donald Trump has fired the director of the FBI over his handling of the inquiry into Hillary Clinton's emails, the administration says.
The White House shocked Washington by announcing that James Comey "has been terminated and removed from office".
But Democrats said he was fired because the FBI was investigating alleged links between the Trump campaign and Russia.
The move came as it emerged Comey gave inaccurate information to Congress last week about Clinton emails.
Comey was addressing FBI agents in Los Angeles when, according to US media, he learned he had just been fired when he saw the news on television.
The 56-year-old - who was three-and-a-half years into his 10-year term as FBI director - reportedly laughed, thinking it was a prank.
The White House said the search for a successor would begin immediately. It is only the second time the head of the FBI has been fired.
Many have expressed surprise that Comey should be fired for his handling of the investigation into Clinton's use of a private email server for sensitive government business, given that Trump once praised the FBI director's conduct in the matter.

UNP wont have Rajitha removed
The UNP yesterday stated that it is against removing Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post.
Responding to a question by a journalist at a press conference at UNP headquarters, Sirikotha UNP back bencher Hector Appuhami said Minister John Seneviratne has no moral right to make such a request. Minister Senaratne was in the vanguard of creating the yahapalana government and he was with us from the beginning. He speaks straight. He has undertaken a huge task on behalf of the people. We, in the UNP, do not agree to his removal from the Cabinet Co-Spokesman post. Minister John Seneviratne who joined the Cabinet later has no right to make such a demand. We dont think that Dr. Senaratne made any wrong statement or said anything against the country, he said.
When asked on the Cabinet reshuffle, the MP said the truth about the rumours would come out after the Cabinet meeting.

WI legend Brian Lara to deliver Cowdrey Lecture at Lords
Former West Indies batsman Brian Lara will deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture at Lords later this year.
Lara still holds the records for the highest individual scores in Test and first-class matches, and is one of only seven batsmen to have surpassed 10,000 runs in both Tests and one-day internationals.
The Trinidadian will become the second former Windies star to give the showpiece address, after Clive Lloyd did so in 2006, when he delivers his speech on September 4 - three days before the start of Englands third Test against West Indies at HQ.
MCC president Matthew Fleming said: I know from personal, and painful, experience, that Brian Lara is quite simply one of the best cricketers to have ever picked up a bat. When he batted, he changed the landscape of the sport.
Now in retirement, he is demonstrating a perception and passion for the game which suggests he will continue to help shape the game into the future.
An incredibly popular and respected man throughout the cricketing world, I am thrilled that Brian has agreed to deliver the MCC Spirit of Cricket Cowdrey Lecture this year and everyone at the club looks forward to his thoughtful insights on the future of cricket.  Daily Mail

Wiggy blocked by protesting unemployed graduates
Northern Province Chief Minister C. V. Wigneswaran was prevented from attending the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) session by a group of protesting unemployed graduates yesterday. Wigneswaran, along with several other Councillors, had to return without attending the sessions as the unemployed graduates had blocked both entrance gates to the NPC. The graduates have been protesting in front of the NPC for the last two months demanding jobs.
Wigneswarans plea that he be allowed to enter had been refused by the angry graduates, sources from Jaffna said.
The Chief Minister had said that he will intervene to solve the graduates issues shortly but the graduates had been adamant claiming that for two long months their requests have fallen on deaf ears.
The 92nd NPC council session was scheduled to be held today.

Writ petition re-fixed for support
A writ petition filed by a public interests litigation activist seeking a Mandamus Order directing the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme by 85 of Government and Opposition Parliamentarians was yesterday re-fixed for support by Supreme Court.
The petition will be taken up for support on June 15.
The petition had been filed by Attorney-at-law Nagananda Kodituwakku naming the Commission to Investigate Allegation of Bribery or Corruption Commission, which has failed to perform their statutory duty on the plausible complaint made on corruption against Members of Parliament and the Cabinet of Ministers who have patently abused the public office to defraud the governments tax-revenue for unjust enrichment.
The petitioner maintained that selling of permits and defrauding government revenue in this fraud falls within the definition of the offence of corruption under section 70 of the Bribery Act.
The petitioner is seeking a writ in the nature of a writ of Mandamus compelling the Bribery Commission to initiate a credible and independent investigation into the plausible complaint made by the petitioner under section 4 of the CIABOC Act No 19 of 1994 against the abuse of the Tax-free permit scheme for improper purpose of unjust enrichment by those who hold public office as MPs and members of the Cabinet of Ministers in the government of the republic of Sri Lanka.
The petitioner stated that in the process of a study conducted into the abuse of tax-free permits offered to MPs, he discovered that the government had been incurring a colossal loss of revenue under the previous Mahinda Rajapaksa regime and a formal complaint was made on December 11, 2014 to the Bribery Commission to initiate an investigation into the matter forthwith. These losses amounting to over 40 billion rupees a year were evidenced in the content of the first fiscal policy statement made in Parliament on November 20, 2015 by the Finance Minister.
The Finance Minister on May 2, 2016 issuing the Gazette Notification No 1965/2 under section 3C of the Excise (Special Provisions Act No 13 of 1989), empowering the Secretary to the Ministry of Parliamentary reforms to grant total tax exemption to MPs for importation of motor vehicles (up to the value of US$ 62,500 per each vehicle) with no engine capacity or fuel type specified, the petitioner added.
The Finance Ministers deliberate action has paved the way for the loss of government revenue of over 7 billion rupees and set at December 9, 2016, 85 expensive vehicles have been imported evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for each vehicle.
Most of the vehicles imported by those who have purchased the permits have been registered with the Department of Motor Traffic first in the name of the permit holder MP and then immediately afterwards transferred in the name of the buyers of the permits.
If not for MP tax-permits, every individuals who has imported these expensive vehicles should have paid fiscal levies at the rate of 300 percent of the transaction value, the petitioner further added.
The eighty five MPs who had been named as respondents for allegedly evading the tax component of over 33 million rupees for each vehicles were: Udaya Gammanpila, Sujeewa Senasinghe, Shehan Semasinghe, Ramesh Pathirana, Kanchana Wijesekara, Annamalai Sivasakthi, Nimal Lansa, Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Priyantha Asoka, D.

Governance in many Asia Pacific countries worsened during last few years
Governance in many of the countries in the Asia Pacific region has worsened over the last few years, UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP) said yesterday in Colombo.
The ESCAP in their report the Economic and Social Survey for Asia and the Pacific 2017 launched yesterday, stated that many countries rely more on domestic demand for their economic growth given the prolonged weakness in external demand and global trade.The report was launched simultaneously in 24 locations around the world.
Sri Lankas medium-term economic development was contingent upon the success of reforms designed to reduce stubbornly large fiscal and trade deficits, they stated. This years report was centred on the theme of Governance and fiscal Management. ESCAP, Economic Affairs Officer, Jose Antonio Pedrosa Garcia, discussing the report at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute observed that it was uncertainty more than protectionism which was hampering investment in international trade but countries which displayed better governance generally also tended to have done better economically. The report showed that governance was better with countries that had high economic growth, governance was improved when the people were more educated and it became worse when the country had high natural resources.
Does governance lead to development or does development lead to better governance That is a question which still needs to be answered, said Garcia. Either way in countries where governance was better, there was more fruitful allocation of resources, and governments spent much of their Budget on social protection mechanisms.In countries where governance was bad, a greater percentage of their budgets was spent on defence and interestingly there was also more expenditure on infrastructure in countries where governance was bad.
But the efficiency of these infrastructure developments were lower, Garcia said.
Effects of bad governance such as corruption had a negative impact on the revenue collection of governments. We found that when the tax law is complicated, when a person has to have many interactions with tax officials, when tax officers have a lot of discretionary power or when the salaries of the tax officials were low; there was higher chance of corruption, Garcia said. Who is willing to pay tax when you think corruption is high he asked.

AB de Villiers returns home
Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) have not had the best of seasons in the Indian Premier League (IPL) this year and AB de Villiers has been at the forefront of their failure, scoring only 216 runs in this edition.
To make matters worse, RCB captain Virat Kohli also could not take his team out of trouble on most occasions and the big West Indian Chris Gayle only managed to score 152 runs in 8 matches that he played.
De Villiers took to Twitter on Monday to bid good-bye to this years IPL as the South African returned home to spend some time with his family ahead of the all-important ICC Champions Trophy.
There is still one game left for RCB to play and they will not have the services of De Villiers in that game. So far, RCB have managed to win only two games in 13 matches and currently, the Bangalore-based side is languishing at the bottom of the table with 5 points.
De Villiers wrote, A disappointing #IPL2017. Some tough lessons learnt that we take in to next year! Happy to be home with the family before the #CT17 in June.
Earlier, Kohli took to the social networking site to express his disappointment for having a poor season. Kohli tweeted, Thanks to the @RCBTweets fans for all the unconditional love and support this season as well. Sorry we couldnt play up to our standards.
Kohli would look to end the season on a winning note as RCB play their last match against Delhi Daredevils on May 14 at the Feroz Shah Kotla in New Delhi.  NDTV

Of all wishes Akankha Sutta
On one occasion the Blessed One was staying near Savatthi in Jetas Grove, Anathapindikas monastery. There he addressed the monks, Monks!
Yes, lord, the monks responded.
The Blessed One said: Monks, dwell consummate in virtue, consummate in terms of the Patimokkha. Dwell restrained in accordance with the Patimokkha, consummate in your behavior and sphere of activity. Train yourselves, having undertaken the training rules, seeing danger in the slightest faults.
If a monk would wish, May I be dear and pleasing to my fellows in the holy life, respected by and inspiring to them, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
If a monk would wish, May I be someone who receives robes, almsfood, lodgings, and medical requisites for curing the sick, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.

If a monk would wish, When my kinsmen and relatives who have died and passed away recollect me with brightened minds, may it be of great fruit, of great benefit, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquility of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.

If a monk would wish, May I be resistant to cold, heat, hunger, and thirst; to the touch of gadflies and mosquitoes, wind and sun and creeping things; to abusive, hurtful language; to bodily feelings that, when they arise, are painful, sharp, stabbing, fierce, distasteful, deadly, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
If a monk would wish, May I overcome displeasure, and not be overcome by displeasure. May I dwell conquering again and again any displeasure that has arisen, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
If a monk would wish, May I overcome fear and dread, and not be overcome by fear and dread. May I dwell conquering again and again any fear and dread that have arisen, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.
If a monk would wish, May I attain  whenever I want, without strain, without difficulty  the four jhanas that are heightened mental states, pleasant abidings in the here-and-now, then he should be one who brings the precepts to perfection, who is committed to inner tranquillity of awareness, who does not neglect jhana, who is endowed with insight, and who frequents empty dwellings.

Minuka Rathnayake won the Group J U-10, 50 cc event and his twin brother Ravinu won the second place. Hirusha Padukka bagged the third place. Around 200 competitors took part in a total of 23 motorcar and motorcycle events.
The Defence Secretary Karunasena Hettiarachchi was the chief guest at the award ceremony.

Over the limit...
A poor display of sportsmanship was evident in the 1500 cc Ford Laser/ Mazda car event as race leader Susantha Gunawardena and ultimate winner Upulwan Serasinghe engaged in an ungentlemanly confrontation from the beginning.
Both drivers knocked on each others vehicles several times and tried to obstruct each others way. Upulwan won the race at the last moment after knocking race leader Susanthas car which resulted in Susantha been delayed to complete the race at third.
Susantha was quick to lodge a protest against Upulwan and the organizers did not announce the result subject to an inquiry.
The racing critics criticized both senior drivers, that their disgusting behaviour will remain a big black mark in Sri Lanka motor racing history.

Ban lifted : SA rugby gets approval to bid for 2023 WC
The South African government on Tuesday said it had lifted a ban on the countrys rugby union hosting international events after it made progress improving racial diversity in the sport, paving the way for a 2023 Rugby World Cup bid.
The government imposed the ban last year having pushed for the countrys main sports to create more opportunities for black players and administrators more than two-decades after the end of white-minority rule under the Apartheid system.
The ban also applied to athletics, cricket and netball.
I would like to congratulate rugby, cricket and netball on their improved scores, you were clearly willing to walk the extra mile, Sports Minister Thulas Nxesi said in a statement issued by South African Rugby.
Their right to bid for and host major sporting events, which was revoked before, is hereby immediately reinstated.
Cricket and netball have also had their sanctions lifted, while the ban remained in place for the athletics federation.
Nxesi, who is new in the post, said he expected sporting federations to provide leadership on racial diversity at school and club levels.
The government report also examines participation demographics, governance, and employment equity from school to elite level.
This is great news and a tribute to the work that the sport has been doing in recent years to stay in tune and relevant to modern South Africa, SA Rugby president Mark Alexander said.
We can now put the finishing touches to what we believe will be an outstanding bid to host the 2023 Rugby World Cup.
South Africa are bidding to host the global showpiece along with Ireland and France. A decision is due in November.

Beset by birth, decay and death
Being happy also means being peaceful, but quite often people don't really want to direct their attention to that. There is the connotation of "not interesting" about it, or "not enough happening." Obviously there would be no proliferations (papaca) or excitement. Peace is thought of as an absolute in this world, from a political, social and personal angle.
Yet peace is very hard to find anywhere. One of the reasons must be, not only that it's difficult to attain, but also that very few people work for such an achievement. It seems as if it were a negation of life, of one's own supremacy. Only those who practice a spiritual discipline would care to direct their minds towards peace.
A natural tendency is to cultivate one's own superiority which also often falls into the other extreme, one's own inferiority. When one has one's own superiority in mind, it's impossible to find peace. The only thing that one can find is a power game, "Anything you can do, I can do better." Or, at times, when it's quite obvious that this isn't so then "anything you can do I can't do as well." There are moments of truth in everyone's life, when one sees quite clearly that one can't do everything as well as the next person, whether it's sweeping a path or writing a book.
This kind of stance, which is very common, is the opposite of peacefulness. A display of either one's own abilities or the lack of them, will produce restlessness rather than peace. There's always the reaching out, the craving for a result in the form of other people's admittance of one's own superiority or their denial of it. When they deny it, there is warfare. When they admit it, there is victory.
Victory over other people has as its underlying cause a battle. In war there is never a winner, there are only losers. No matter who signs the peace-treaty first, both sides lose. The same applies to this kind of attitude. There are only losers, even though one may have a momentary victory, having been accepted as the one who knows better, or is stronger or cleverer. Battle and peace do not go well together.
One wonders in the end, does anybody really want peace Nobody seems to have it. Is anybody really trying to get it One does get in life what one strongly determines. It is important to inquire into our innermost heart whether peace is really what we want. The inquiry into one's heart is a difficult thing to do. Most people have a steel door of thick dimensions which is covering the opening of their heart. They can't get in to find out what's going on inside. But everyone needs to try to get in as far as possible and check one's priorities.
In moments of turmoil, when one is either not getting the supremacy one wants or one feels really inferior, then all one desires is peace. Let it all subside again and neither the superiority nor the inferiority is very distinct, then what happens Is it really peace one wants Or does one want to be somebody special, somebody important or lovable
A "somebody" never has peace. There is an interesting simile about a mango tree: a king went riding in the forest and encountered a mango tree laden with fruit. He said to his servants: "Go back in the evening and collect the mangoes," because he wanted them for the royal dinner table. The servants went back to the forest and returned to the palace empty-handed and told the king: "Sorry, sir, the mangoes were all gone, there wasn't a single mango left on the tree." the king thought the servants had been too lazy to go back to the forest, so he rode out himself. What he saw instead of the beautiful mango tree laden with fruit, was a pitiful, bedraggled tree, that had been beaten and robbed of its fruit and leaves. Someone, unable to reach all the branches, had broken them and had taken all the fruit. As the king rode a little farther, he came upon another mango tree, beautiful in all its green splendor, but not a single fruit on it. Nobody had wanted to go near it, since there were no fruits, and so it was left in peace. The king went back to his palace, gave his royal crown and scepter to his ministers and said: "You may now have the kingdom, I am going to live in a hut in the forest."
When one is nobody and has nothing, then there is no danger of warfare or attack, then there's peace. The mango tree laden with fruit didn't have a moment's peace: everybody wanted its fruit. If we really want peace, we have to be nobody. Neither important, nor clever, nor beautiful, nor famous, nor right, nor in charge of anything. We need to be unobtrusive and with as few attributes as possible.
The mango tree which didn't have any fruit was standing peacefully in all its splendor giving shade. To be nobody doesn't mean never to do anything again. It just means to act without self-display and without craving for results.
The mango tree had shade to give, but it didn't display its wares or fret whether anyone wanted its shade. This kind of ability allows for inner peace.

Birth of the highest bliss
Young ascetic Sumedha was steadfast in his attempt to achieve the highest spiritual realm - something only a few could reach. That day he heard Dipankara Buddha was visiting the town. What he wanted was a definite prophecy that he would be a Buddha in eons to come.
The locale, however, was congested with people and the young man could hardly think of seeing Dipankara Buddha. When he spotted the muddy road, his thoughts worked on so fast in a different plane.
He requested the great teacher and his retinue to walk over him. Dipankara Buddha saw the young man's thought in his divine eye, and knew the youth's wish will materialise in uncountable eons to come.
Dipankara Buddha prophesied ascetic Sumedha would be a Buddha named Gotama in the future. The day Buddha declared the solemn prophecy to his twenty-fourth successor was a Vesak Full Moon Poya day. Since then Sumedha had been reborn in many existences. He had to complete the thirty perfections, paramitas. And before his final birth, the Bodhisatva, or Buddha-to-be, was born in Thusitha heaven.
The divine creature inquired five affairs before expiring for the final birth: right time, right area, right continent, right cast and right mother. Then, as any Buddhist knows, the fully mindful divine being entered the womb of Queen Mahamaya to be sired by King Suddhodana.
A prince was born on a Vesak Poya and was named Siddharth, one who has found meaning of existence. The queen passed away seven days after the prince's birth.
The whiz kid declared the glorious verse, customary for all Buddhas, just after the birth: "I am the chief of the world. There is no equal to me. I am supreme. This is my last birth. No rebirth for me." The teacher worshipped the teacher of the world, and then father worshipped the son.
Aspiring for enlightenment
Siddharth Gotama's life was spent in royal luxuries until he realised life's true nature. Moments later Siddharth renounced the princely life on a Vesak Poya. Yet ascetic life was not a simple thing for the prince.
The robed Gotama was trained in various mental skills under many teachers, only to get disillusioned that they do not have the truth he looks for. The right way to achieve the truth dawned on him one day. He directed the mind in the right meditation path. Moments later he reached enlightenment and conquered the world of sorrows on a Vesak Poya.
The Conqueror was heading to the city of Kusinara, when he met Pukkusa. Pukkusa listened to the Dhamma and offered the Buddha two golden robes: one worn by the Buddha and the other by his assistant Ananda.
When the Conqueror was robed, his skin became clear dazzling the robe. Monk Ananda was amazed and the Buddha declared that the skin of a Buddha will be remarkably bright on two occasions: the night he attains Enlightenment and the night he passes into Parinibbana.
Third visit to Sri Lanka
The Buddha visited Sri Lanka on three occasions: first to Mahiyangana in January, second to Nagadipa in April, and third to Kelaniya in May, Vesak. On the second visit made to Nagadipa, King Maniakkikha invited the Blessed One for a third visit to Kelaniya. And he visited Kelaniya three years after his second visit, with 550 arahants.
However Nishantha Gunawardena, a Sri Lankan historian resident in the United States, mentions an interesting find in his The Lost Dynasty: The Buddha was not invited by King Maniakkhika but by a king named Panitha and his daughter princess Abhi Upaliya. Nishantha cites rock inscriptions at Balaharukanda and Bambaragastalawa that corroborate this find.
"...the rock inscriptions are more accurate due to the difficulty in changing or forging them. It was the national King Panitha who invited Gautama Buddha the second time. The regional King Maniakkhika is mentioned in a few other records.
But it was not until the December 2004 tsunami hit, the king reintroduced himself. Tsunami tore through the island exposing several rock inscriptions. Two of them bore the names of King Maniagiya and his mother. This is, in fact, King Maniakkhika." (82pp)
King Maniakikha is commonly mistaken as a Naga king; naga means serpent in oriental languages. But scholars believe the king belonged to a clan named Naga. Following the Buddha's sermon in Kelaniya, the king erected a shrine with the Buddha's hair, utensils and the seat buried inside. However the foreign invasions have resulted in damaging the original shrine.
The Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara became more sacred following the Ven Mahinda's arrival in Lanka to establish the Dhamma wheel officially. Mahawamsa - account of the great clan, if rendered into English - the official chronicle on Sri Lankan history written in the 5th Century CE, states King Devanampiyatissa's brother Uttiya renovated the Dagoba along with the first quarters of the monks.
Buddhas footprint
Mahavamsa interestingly relates how the Blessed One journeyed to Adams Peak or Sumanakuta from Kelani on the Vesak Poya day. The 7359-ft-tall conical mountain has a historic significance as Buddhists believe it has the Buddha's footprint on it.
The mount is normally known as Adam's Peak for Christians and Shivan Adipatham (Shiva's footprint) for Hindus. The mount has obviously become the meeting place for the people of diverse religions and ethnicities.
In Sinhala the mount is known as Sri Pada, the term derived from Sanskrit denoting the sacred foot. The Sinhala Samanala Kanda, or Butterfly Mountain in English, is named thus because of the annually migrating butterflies.
Legend has it that the Buddha placed his left footprint on the hill summit and then strode across to Thailand, then Siam. In Siam the Buddha is said to have left the impression of the right foot; this is called Phra Sat, similar to Sri Pada. In his Bharhut Stupa General Sir A Cunningham rests details about footprints:
Footprints of the Buddha were most probably an object of reverence from a very early period - certainly before the building of the Bharut Stupa - as they are represented in two separate sculptures there. In the sculpture the footprints are placed on a throne or altar, canopied by an umbrella hung with garlands.
A royal personage is kneeling before the altar, and reverently touching the footprints with his hands. The second example is in the bas-relief representing the visit of Ajata-satru to Buddha. Here, as in all other Bharut sculptures, the Buddha does not appear in person, his presence being marked by His two footprints. The wheel symbol is duly marked on both. (112pp).
A cave temple called Diva Guhava is recognised as the place the Buddha had respite during his Sri Pada visit along with his retinue. The cave is said to have the capacity to provide shelter for over 500 people. Siripa samaya, the season of Sripa pilgrimage starts in December through May.
"When the Teacher, compassionate to the whole world," goes on Mahavamsa, "had preached the doctrine there, he rose, the Master, and left the traces of his footsteps plain to sight on Sumanakuta.
And after he had spent the day as it pleased him at the foot of this mountain, with the brotherhood, be set forth for Dighavapi."
Some historians however see the Buddha's visit to Dighavapi far from being likely. As the chronicle states, the Buddha had visited the village and meditated consecrating the place. A shrine was later erected on the place the Blessed One meditated.
Many works including Samantha Pasadika and Dipavamsa contain allusions to Dighavapi.
The works mention the inhabitants of Dighavapi were Yakkas, with links to pre-Aryan Kirat people in Northern India. As a legend goes, while a novice monk was repairing a part of the shrine, he fell from the top. He heard the shouting of his colleagues to recall Dhajagga Paritta, a sutta reciting the great qualities of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha. And finally, it is said, the novice monk was saved miraculously. The area was later reconstructed by King Saddhatissa.

Bonded by Buddhism
Any other year, Vesak would only be a religious event, but this year a political dimension has been added primarily by the Joint Opposition which has capitalised on Indian PM Narendra Modis visit to Sri Lanka for the UN Day of Vesak celebrations, being held here for the first time. Although the visit is entirely religious-oriented with a few social events, the Joint Opposition is indulging in a campaign spreading an India scare among especially the unsuspecting rural masses that the Indian PM will be here to sign an agreement that will cede control of the oil tanks in Trincomalee in India. Both Indian and Sri Lankan authorities have refuted this allegation. Modi, though not a Buddhist, is an ardent admirer of the religion and has started a drive to revive Indias Buddhist heritage.
Prime Minister Modi will go directly to the Gangaramaya Vesak Zone after he touches down at the Bandaranaike International Airport. He will jointly inaugurate the festivities there with Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. He will thereafter join President Sirisena at dinner the same day and will be the Chief Guest at the official UN Day of Vesak ceremony to be held the next day. Prime Minister Modi is billed to talk about the heritage shared by the two countries and the life of the Buddha. Buddhism is Indias greatest gift to Sri Lanka and the presence of its Prime Minister at the UN Vesak Day deliberations can be considered a great honour. In fact, the Government has also invited the President of Nepal Bidhya Devi Bhandari to the UN Vesak Day celebrations, giving due recognition to the two countries where the Buddha once trod  Nepal and India.
The UN Vesak Day came into being due to the efforts of former Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar who rendered a great service to the country during the troubled times when Sri Lanka was facing a war with the LTTE. While campaigning against the terror outfit globally, he also found time to campaign for UN recognition of Vesak Day. The UN has been celebrating Vesak officially since 1999.
Indian Prime Ministers visit
This years UN Vesak Day theme is Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace. A UN Vesak conference will be held under this theme, with the participation of over 4,000 delegates from 100 Buddhist and non-Buddhist countries. This has generated interest around the world since Buddhism is one of the fastest growing religions. It was reported that the events involving Prime Minister Modi will be watched by 1.2 billion people across India and Sri Lanka. The events will be featured live on Indian TV and the country will be the centre of attraction.
The Indian Prime Minister will also fly to Dikoya where he will declare open a hospital for the welfare of the people in the area including the estate workers of Indian origin. He will also participate in an interaction session with the people at the Norwood grounds. President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are also expected to join. A special advance squad was sent to the venue and the surroundings to make sure that wasps would not interfere with the proceedings. There have been a number of wasp attacks in the area.
Prime Minister Modi will visit Kandy later in the evening to receive the blessings of the two Most Ven. Mahanayakes of Malwatte and Asgiriya Chapters and leave for New Delhi thereafter.
According to diplomatic sources there are no economic objectives attached to the official visit of the Indian Prime Minister. It is a kind of pilgrimage, Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu told journalists on Monday.
Despite claims by both the Sri Lankan Government and Indian authorities that no bilateral agreements are on the schedule during the visit, the Joint Opposition has claimed that the government was pawning the Trincomalee oil tanks to India. Hence it is important to explore the actual mechanism that led to the MoU signed between Sri Lanka and India during the recent visit of Premier Ranil Wickremesinghe to New Delhi. The fears of the Opposition are virtually unfounded since the development of oil tank farm in Trincomalee is a joint venture between Ceylon Petroleum Corporation and the Indian Oil Company (IOC). The investment ratio could be 50%-50% or thereabouts, depending on the quantum of investment needed to upgrade the oil tanks.
The oil tank farm built by the British during the Second World War was idling for a long time without being utilized. India has assured that developing it further would be the best option as it could not be used for any other purpose. Incidentally, the tank farm was also subjected to a kamikaze attack by a Japanese warplane pilot during World War II. The remains of the plane can still be found near one of the tanks.
There are a lot of misconceptions and theories about Indo-Lanka cooperation, with many saying that India is keen to counterbalance Chinese projects in Sri Lanka. But the economic angle seems to have been forgotten  for example, the economic zone in Hambantota, a huge investment by China, can be used to penetrate the Indian Market. It is time that Sri Lankans learned to think beyond the 21 million market at home. India has a population of 1.2 billion and China too is a one billion plus market. Our trade and tourism efforts must be focused in this direction.
Fears have been expressed about the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India which is under negotiation. Contrary to popular opinion, Indian doctors or other professional categories will not be able to come here en masse and take our jobs away following ETCA. There is no need for any agreements to fill labour shortages legally  Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka disclosed recently that as many as 200,000 foreign construction workers are already in Sri Lanka. But there is no such possibility for the medical profession, where the local output of doctors is adequate for healthcare needs.
While the JO did campaign against Prime Minister Modis visit, MP Wimal Weerawansa went a bit too far in calling on the people to hoist black flags on Vesak Day. Other members of the JO were quick to distance themselves from the MPs remarks, which drew widespread condemnation from senior Buddhist monks, intellectuals and the common people. Social media users castigated the MP who found only one other voice in his defence  the equally controversial Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera of the Bodu Bala Sena.
Geethas Parliamentary Seat
The Appeal Court verdict on MP Geetha Kuamarasinghes eligibility to hold a Parliamentary Seat on account of her being a dual citizen has rattled a number of other MPs who hold dual citizenships. Secretary-General of Parliament Dhammika Dasanayake has informed the Chairman of the Election Commission that the MP post of UPFA Galle district Parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe has been annulled in line with the Court of Appeal verdict. According to the newly introduced 19th amendment to the Constitution, a Sri Lankan Citizen holding citizenship status in another country cannot hold a seat in Parliament. They will surely watch on as she has already appealed to the Supreme Court to see where that leads, before taking any other action. Kumarasinghe has said that she renounced her Swiss citizenship sometime back. Several MPs have called on the Government to reveal the names of ministers and MPs who are dual citizens. Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) General Secretary and MP, Udaya Gammanpila requested the Controller of Immigration and Emigration to furnish the details of the parliamentarians who held dual citizenship. He attached a list of MPs in his letter to the Controller asking whether any of them were dual citizens as at August 17, 2015. When applying for a passport, the applicant has to mention whether he is a dual citizen. The MPs passport and identity card numbers could be obtained from Parliament, Gammanpila said. We shall refrain from naming these MPs for legal reasons, except for MP Basil Rajapaksa who himself admitted his US citizenship and vowed not to renounce it. Speaking to the BCC Sinhala Service, Rajapaksa said he had nothing to hide about his citizenship of the US, where his wife and children are domiciled.
The reduction of the security accorded to former Prsident Mahinda Rajapaksa was another hot political topic. The JO has protested this move, saying it could pose a threat to the life of the former President. However, Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayake has countered saying that even after the reduction, the former President would be having more than 180 security personnel drawn from the Police and STF. Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga too entered the debate, saying it was Rajapaksa himself who ordered the pruning down of security of ex-Presidents. In any case, the Government said security details are periodically assessed in line with security concerns and could either be bolstered or reduced depending on the requirements.
The much-talked about Cabinet reshuffle may not happen as none of the UNP Ministers was willing to take over another portfolio. The feeling was mutual on the SLFP side. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe has assured UNP ministers portfolios will not be changed. According to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, it is discretionary for the President to consult the Prime Minister in the appointment of Cabinet Ministers and assignment of subjects. However, the Government must be mindful about the fact that the public has a rather negative view of certain ministers from both sides and a mid-term refresh may do no harm.
SLFP faction of the National Unity government
Last week, both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe found time to talk with their respective ministers and other close associates. The President had a long discussion with his loyalists on Monday night to discuss the issues facing the Unity Government. The discussion lasted for hours and the ministers who participated in the discussion were tight lipped. However it appears that they discussed the Rajitha Senaratne-John Seneviratne issue and many other developments that had manifestly disturbed the SLFP faction of the National Unity government. Several ministers had apparently demanded the sacking of Senaratne from the Cabinet over his remarks against Seneviratne and other SLFP figures, but they have to keep in mind that Senaratne was one of the key architects of the Rainbow Coalition that brought President Sirisena to power. Senaratne and his son Chathura are however known to make controversial statements from time to time.
The UNP too had a soul-searching session that went late into the night. With two elections on the cards this year alone, the Grand Old Party of local politics cannot afford to be complacent. In the wake of political challenges, the UNP working committee has decided to appoint three committees to look into the partys future. These committees will be headed by Mangala Samaraweera, Ajith P Perera and Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Samaraweera will head the committee on communications, Perera will be in charge of the committee on elections and Kariyawasam will handle the committee on grassroots level organisation of the party.
The committee headed by Samaraweera will also include Harin Fernando and Harsha De Silva, who is incidentally Samaraweeras deputy at the Foreign Ministry. The committee in charge of elections will include Sajith Premadasa, Ravi Karunanayake, Lakshman Kiriella and Vajira Abeywardene.
The working committee also discussed the possibility of starting a publicity campaign based mostly on social media. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also thanked all UNP organisers for the massive crowd that thronged its May Day rally.
President Sirisena was one of the first leaders to congratulate newly-elected French President Emmanuel Macron on Monday morning. Although a direct comparison may not be wise, ethno-nationalist movements worldwide that were riding high in recent times have come crashing down to earth after nationalist and isolationist Marine Le Pens huge defeat on Sunday. It suggests that at least for the time being, voters prefer globalism rather than isolationism.
This is a lesson for extremist parties in Sri Lanka and the region, which thrive by driving fear into peoples heart. France has marked the defeat of fear and the triumph of hope, which is what we all need at this hour.

Title: Isurumuni Rock TempleAuthor: J.B DisanayakaPhoto Artist: Panduka De SilvaPublisher: Sumitha Publishers
When I first set my eyes on him it felt as though he had seen me but turned his head away to tease me. His half-closed eyes, the slight smile hovering on his lips, the sinewy arms, the well built torso make it crystal clear (only it's not crystal) that he is the kind of man who would have won any fair maiden's heart. If so, on an evening many moons ago, did he sit there in front of the pond, gazing at the waves dancing to the music of the wind, with the last rays of the sun reluctantly bidding good bye to the Esela flowers on the trees around him, with his horse standing behind him, waiting for his lady love
I think so. I hope so. I hope even as the first rays of the moon started to light his surroundings, a beautiful lady walked towards him, making those lazy eyes brighten up, turning those lips into a full smile. But I could be wrong. Just as everyone else who had gazed at him across the years and given him various names, predicted different dates of birth and written his life's story with many twists and turns, might be wrong.
If so, Dr. D.T Devendra who wrote in 'Sinhalese Classical Sculpture' (1958) that the man I believe to be waiting for his love is really Alexander the Great and the animal behind him, is his horse Bucephalus, might be wrong. Henry Parker, who in his book, 'Ancient Ceylon' identified him as a 'seated warrior wearing a helmet' might also be wrong. So too, many others: L.T.P Manjushri, (who thought the figure represents Ananga-Kama- the Indian God of Love) Dr. Ananda Coomaraswamy who calls him the sage Kapila mentioned in the Ramayana and Prof. J. E. Van Lohuizen who argues that he represents god Aiyanar. Who then, could be right Who then knows the exact identity of the beautifully carved sculpture of the man and the horse at Isurumuniya in Anuradhapura that has drawn the attention of archaeologists, critics and romantic-dreamers alike for over two centuries
The answer could be found in Prof. J.B Disanayaka's latest publication - 'Isurumuni Rock Temple'. Stepping on territory already covered with many footprints Prof. Disanayaka discusses the above identities attributed to this sculpture described as a 'tremendous work, impossible to forget once seen (Laurence Binyon)with almost the same delicate manures as the unknown artist who weilded his chisel over the stone surface to create an everlasting masterpiece. He leaves the reader to decide whose argument best befits the stone figure and ends the chapter giving his own interpretation. While not wishing to give away the clues that would help you to solve the curious case of the man and his horse and spoil the fun, I think it is safe to say Prof. Disanayaka's answer is the most plausible of the lot. But, thankfully, even as he shows his view is surely the most logical, Prof Disanayaka generously leaves ample room in his narrative for those like me with a more wild imagination to hold on to our own interpretations as well. (So, even though I know the Professor might be right, I will continue to believe the man carved in stone is a writer who lived in Anuradhapura and was waiting to meet his love to explain to her the plot of his newest story!)
Speculation apart, from the awesome grandeur of the Great Stupa  Ruwanveli Saya to the delicate gestures of the two lovers at Isurumuniya, Prof. Disanayaka's 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' with its beautifully illustrated history offers a thorough and delightfully readable introduction to the spellbinding power of ancient Anuradhapura.
Describing how the city was first designed Prof. Disanayaka quotes from Prof. G. P Malalasekera's 'Dictionary of Pali Proper Names' in which Prof. Malalasekera writes of what the Mahavamsa says about Anuradhapura.  Pandukabhaya beautified the city with the artificial lakes Jayavapi and Abhayavapi. It was round the last-named lake that the king laid out the city, including four suburbs, a cemetery, special villages for huntsmen and scavengers, temples...and residences for engineers and other officials. Abodes were also provided for devotees of various sects...there were also hospitals and lying-in-homes.
Prof. Disanayaka concludes his introduction with the reminder that the modern city of Anuradhapura is divided into two: the Sacred City and the New Town. The Sacred City includes the so-called 'A ta mas ta na' (The Eight Sacred Sites) and I su ru mu ni Temple, the subject matter of this book.
Sites you would expect to read about the six stupas, the sacred tree, the chapter house, and the Tissa vava are here, as well as plenty of surprises, such as the description about the sculpture of a royal family (where King Dutu Gemunu meets his son in the presence of his wife and Asokamala), the Goldfish Park (where Duttagamini's only son Prince Saliya met the untouchable woman Asokamala and renounced the throne out of love for her), or the Mystic Diagram (could this be the first map of the universe); less obvious artifacts that, together with the more well-known sites, collectively tell the story of our first kings and queens, prince and princesses, and the glory of the city they helped build.
From Thuparama to Lankarama to the arch of the Dragon to the Footprints of the Buddha to the sculpture of elephants playing in water to the stone sculptures of mythical beings and comical figures, 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' is guaranteed to take you on a fascinating journey through the first royal capital of our nations history. Sharing the inside stories of a kingdom that saw the rise and fall of 113 kings as well as illustrating the recent developments (the stone Buddha image now plastered in gold, the Buddha images in the new shrine), Professor Disanayaka with photo artist Panduka de Silva leaves no stone unturned. Exploring the ancient sites of Anuradhapura by connecting places, people, and events of the past he weaves a national narrative that is often surprising, sometimes sad, but always engaging.
A one-of-a-kind guide to the most important cultural and historic sites in Anuradhapura, 'Isurumuni Rock Temple' is guaranteed to fascinate, educate, and entertain both the rationalists and the dreamers.
By the time you reach the last page of the book you will realize what Harry Williams wrote in his ' Ceylon, Pearl of the East', about the temple at Isurumuniya is perfectly true. Here is a place that 'reeks of romance and of the past, with that particular atmosphere which clings to the rocks and caves and calls to something atavistic in the most prosaic of men.
Thank you, Prof Disanayaka for preserving the romance in spite of the logical arguments that surrounds ancient Anuradhapura through this book, for bringing the ancient capital to us in such a way that we see it as a place that is comfortably familiar and intriguingly exotic.

Bouchard beats fallen idol Sharapova in Madrid
Madrid: Eugenie Bouchard claimed she had the support of the tennis world after matching her fighting talk with some thrilling tennis to shock Maria Sharapova 7-5, 2-6, 6-4 in the second round of the Madrid Open on Monday.
Bouchard called Sharapova "a cheater" last week and was also critical of the Russian's welcome back to the sport after a 15-month doping ban with a series of wildcards for big events.
The world number 60 admitted she was extra motivated to face her former idol and it showed with signs of the form she has lost over the past few years since reaching the Wimbledon final in 2014 in a bruising near three-hour contest.
"I was actually quite inspired before the match because I had a lot of players coming up to me privately wishing me good luck," said Bouchard.

"Players I don't normally speak to, getting a lot of texts from people in the tennis world that were just rooting for me.
"I wanted to do it for myself, but also all these people. I really felt support.
"It showed me that most people have my opinion, and they were just maybe scared to speak out."
Sharapova claimed to have not been distracted by media circus surrounding the match and that her disappointment comes from losing, not who she lost to.
"I think I would be worried about myself if I sat here and said I'm pretty happy with losing a tennis match, no matter who I face, no matter what round it is, whether it's the first round or final of a Grand Slam.
"I'm a big competitor. What you work for so many hours every single day is to be on the winning end of matches.
"Today was just not that day. Of course, I'm disappointed. That's what's going to make me a better player. That's what's going to win me more tournaments and more Grand Slams."
Bouchard battled back from 4-2 down to claim a topsy-turvy first set and she edged a marathon 11th game before serving it out for just her second set in five meetings with Sharapova.
However, adversity brought out the best in the five-time Grand Slam champion as Sharapova found the precision to match her power in the second set, reeling off four straight game from 2-2 to level at one set all.
Both players struggled to hold serve in the deciding set as a total of 14 break points were squandered.
However, Bouchard held her nerve when serving for the match at 5-4 as she saw off two break points and an unfortunate let cord on her first match point. The Canadian jumped for joy after delivering the final blow before the two exchanged a very frosty handshake at the net.
Bouchard will face top seed Angelique Kerber, who fought back from 5-3 down in the deciding set to overcome Katerina Siniakova 6-2, 1-6, 7-5 earlier on Monday, in the third round.
Kerber has had an inconsistent season and her fragile form was on show in the course of the first two sets.
The German romped through the opening set in 27 minutes but then had to save six break points for her only game in the second. Siniakova served for the match at 5-4 in the deciding set, but Kerber should impressive fight to win the last four games.
World number three Karolina Pliskova was dumped out 6-3, 6-3 by Latvia's Anastasija Sevastova. In the men's Madrid Masters there were comfortable wins for Thomas Berdych, Grigor Dimitrov and Nick Kyrgios. However, 15th seed Gael Monfils bowed out in a wild match against French compatriot Gilles Simon 0-6, 6-0, 7-6 (7/0). Andy Murray begins his quest for a third title in Madrid on Wednesday when he faces Romanian Marius Copil.

Buddhism in practice
Twenty six centuries ago, an unprecedented and extraordinary epoch was dawn in our human history which a multitude of people still respectfully commemorate and spiritually celebrate, not blindly but realistically.
An incomparable birth, the full enlightenment and great passing away of the Son of Shakya clan (Shakya Putta) are the most significant events which are commemorated by millions of people through the practice of giving, moral conduct and purification of the mind.
As the aspirant of the Buddha; the Bodhisatta, who enthusiastically sought the ultimate truth, an incomparable noble search was implemented and actuated with indefatigable endeavour and indefinable determination till he reached the beacon of the conclusion of the aspiration of his spiritual purpose, the full enlightenment.
An inconceivable challenges and ineffable difficulties were enormous and excessively inundated in his life but he patiently overcame and assiduously conquered them with courage and perseverance. With his unique dedication and paramount persistency he conquered the battle of defilements and impurities; ultimately by treading the Noble Eightfold Path or Path of Purification he attained his spiritual accomplishment, the bliss of Nibbana.
As the Perfectly Enlightened One the Gotama Buddha made his foremost statement and solid proclamation by presenting the following confirmation.
Through many a birth in Samsara, have I wandered in vain, seeking the builder of his house of life. Repeated and continual birth is indeed suffering!
O house-builder, you are seen!
You will not build this house again. For all your rafters broken and your ridgepole shattered.
My mind has reached the unconditioned! I have attained the destruction of cravings.
Though we pompously speak and make observations with excessive pride with others about worldly-minded achievements of science and Nano technology along with digital revolution in this New Millennium, still none of the scientists or technologists can guide humanity to eradicate and eliminate their mental agonies and miseries the way the Master the Gotama Buddha train and lead mankind without any discrimination or prejudice.
Modern science and Nano-technology have created competitive commercial culture in our human society today. Profit based multinational companies have influenced innocent people towards less happiness based life style. Numerous countries struggle to improve their own Gross Domestic Product (GDP) but never introduce and concentrate on Gross National happiness (GNH). This is the catastrophic situation in Srilanka today. Back in 1970s 04th king of Bhutan famously pronounced that for Bhutan Gross National Happiness is more important than Gross Domestic Product. This is an unprecedented pronouncement and very impressive statement which we rarely hear from heads of state in other part of the world today.
Today, emotional disturbances and mental traumas are overflowing in our human society.
Unfortunately some members in our society come to an end with catastrophic conclusion due to their inconceivable agonies. Mental distress, frustration, stress, anxiety, grief, misery, sorrow, despair, depression are widely known and prominent maladies and afflictions which we daily experience and encounter around the globe today.
The significance of the Buddha Dhamma, the teaching of the Buddha is opening the gate way to find and scrutinize the underlying tendencies of the mind and removing the cloud of ignorance which tremendously covers the human mind. The great Master, the Buddha has prescribed many techniques to apply and train ourselves to win the battle of hidden tendencies. This is why the Buddha Dhamma is widely accepted and appreciated in our human society today.
It is methodical and precise; it is practical and pragmatic. The vital factor in Buddha Dhamma is training and discipline. This is why many members in our society diligently follow and practice meditation. The Gotama Buddha has clearly emphasised the way to get rid of and root out all impurities that victimize the human mind in his numerous discourses during his forty five years ministry as a Fully Enlightened One.
Majority may believe that building monuments, decorating shrine rooms, constructing colossal ramparts, gigantic domes and giant arches, organizing massive parades are the factors that one should perform and complete to achieve the true spiritual goal. Of course they are the supportive factors to maintain the dispensation of the Buddha. But, in order to cultivate and develop inner spiritual faculties one should wisely and honestly practice meditation. Practice of meditation truly helps one to detect and discover the true nature of ones mind. An extensive period of concentrative process will be in conclusion of the detection and disclosure of true nature of the mind. The constant effort and the resolute dedication is the key factor to achieve innermost peace.
Some may firmly believe that aggressively working and fighting to preserve and protect their nationality and culture is what the Gotama Buddha asked and encouraged us to practice but none was included in his discourses at all.
Once, when his disciples assembled, the Buddha precisely emphasised thus;
 Bhikkhus ,there are these four means of sustaining a favourable relationship.
What four Giving, endearing speech, beneficent conduct, and impartiality. These are four means of sustaining a favourable relationship.
Unfortunately, many people have completely forgotten the authentic approach to find the true peace and innermost happiness that the great Master, the Buddha compassionately asked to achieve. There are numerous unacceptable and disgraceful activities are visible in the vicinity of the island of the Dhamma and political movements are gravely apparent and undeniable in our society today. These provocative pursuits will constantly lead and create a very violent and hostile environment in our peaceful society.
Some people, both so called monks and laities have politicised the Three Refuges (The Buddha, The Dhamma and The Sangha). Lack of true knowledge, lack of correct practice, lack of true leadership qualities and inadequacy of discipline and training are the well known facts and distinct reality. Cultural values and religious ethics are utterly forgotten. The current unscrupulous demeanour of some monks is very dangerous example for our future generation.
This may drive to ruin and damage the authenticity of the Buddhas words. Millions of followers listen to numerous sermons; preachers competitively verbalize and prattle with their own interpretations to entertain unwise listeners. But crime rates and other despicable acts are brimming and horrendously overflowing.
Unfortunately, the deplorable and distressing fact is that individual branded credos and dogmas are proliferated and multiplied in the name of the Buddha Dhamma. No any authority in the community of the Buddhist monks or responsible government to take any decisive and conclusive action to protect and preserve true doctrine and discipline (Dhamma Vinaya).
The quality and standard of the monkhood has been drastically changed. Many monks have embraced and engaged in party politics. The life style, the way of life, behaviour as a disciple of the Buddha, deportment of monkhood, duties and responsibilities as a monk is completely disappeared and absent in certain individuals.
Unacceptable behaviour and disgraceful acts of so called monks lead drastically changed peoples respectful attitudes and deep rooted devotion. The way they speak and express their antagonistic ideas and inimical views is completely dangerous and catastrophic. Our future generation will be in vulnerable situation and true spiritual practice will be dramatically disappeared.
The Buddha declared that Vinayo Naama Sasanassa Aayu Discipline is the lifespan of the dispensation of the Buddha. Numerous well-disciplined and well trained monks have guided our Buddhist community with outstanding examples but now it is in topsy-turvy.
Some mentally retarded and psychologically damaged individuals attempt to repair and renew their blemished reputation by using their own political views and racial provocations. Some of them have mixed the doctrine and asking lay people to practice what monks should practice and monks are doing on the contrary to what they have to practice.
Vinaya or discipline is very crucial fact in Buddha Sasana or dispensation of the Buddha. As a monk or bhikkhu , he must be trained under his teacher or senior monk for at least five years after higher ordination. If teacher or senior monk does not allow him to perform activities such as delivering sermons, conducting meditation programmes or holding discussions, he must remain till he is given permission. Unfortunately currently what has happened is catastrophic. No any training or probation period for novices or bhikkhus, therefore people are confused and following wrong dogmas.
The current propensity and inconceivable proclivity in Sinhalese Buddhist community around the globe is indescribable. Listening to multitudes of sermons and taking part of meditation programmes are widely spread and fast growing cult of personality.
Time has arrived with the pure and pragmatic message of peace and harmony which twenty six centuries old but it is still fresh and applicable to all without any impediment. We all must honestly and truly implant the correct and unblemished seeds of Four Sublime Qualities such as Metta ( Loving Kindness), Karuna ( Compassion) Mudita ( Appreciative joy) and Upekkha (Equanimity) and genuinely cultivate and diligently develop them to achieve the true peace within.
Hatred, jealousy, craving for power, lust, all defilements and underlying tendencies are the driving forces which lead humanity to disharmony, warfare and conflicts. That is the true nature of external environment but their innermost atmosphere is horrendously defiled and dreadfully corrupted.
Everyone must be very mindful of this grave and serious inner environment. The Buddha Dhamma is the very pragmatic guide and captain that direct us to the right path to meet the ultimate indescribable innermost peace and inner happiness.

Cabinet approves Policy on National Reconciliation: Chandrika
The National Policy on Reconciliation has been approved by the Cabinet, the Chairman of the Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) and former President Chandrika Banadaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday announced.
She said ONURs National Policy will be the state policy on national reconciliation and co-existence, which will serve as a guideline for carrying out national reconciliation programmes throughout the country for all stakeholders, including ministries, government institutions and NGOs alike.
Former President Kumaratunge said so at a press conference held at her ONUR office in the SEMA building, Colombo.
She said it is the first time that such a comprehensive policy has been adopted by any government.
You can say that it is not only the policy of the government, it is the policy of state of Sri Lanka on reconciliation, she said.
She said they finalised what they thought as the ultimate draft on the national reconciliation policy after a process of wide array of consultations with institutions, persons, ministries and NGOs that are concerned on the subject.
We sent the draft to Cabinet under the signature of President Maithripala Sirisena, who gave us much leadership as ONUR comes under the purview of the President.
When one of the Ministers, Minister of National Coexistence, Dialogue and Official Languages requested some amendments to the draft with regard to two matters, namely language policy and coexistence mainly, they too were resolved and entered into the final draft, she said and added, the final draft being prepared by ONUR has just been approved last week, on the second of May by the Cabinet, and probably confirmed today (yesterday) by it.
She said some of the main objectives of the Policy document have already been implemented. They include religious festivals and events, cultural programs, and conflict awareness programs to be participated by school children across the island. In keeping with these programs the children of other religions belonging to various ethnic communities are to take part in at least one main religious event of another religion,Kumaratunge explained.
She said they have already covered up to 200, 000 school children above 13 years already. We are not going to let it stop there for there will be a second phase. We have a lot of other programs to create awareness among adults where they come and discuss the conflict, harmony and coexistence at workshops, she said.
We also use various art forms and sports events to promote reconciliation. Language policy is being implemented by the Minister of Languages. The resettlement or handing bank of lands to rightful owners is being done by another ministry.
I must also say that forces are very much involved in the resettlement process for they are building houses in the North for those who have lost them due to the conflict, she said.
We also talk about guaranteeing the rights of the minorities while a Constitutional process- is also in effect. Its process is somewhat slow. It is in the hands of Parliament and the government, she pointed out.
The policy on Reconciliation has been drafted after revisiting the findings and insights contained in reports such as the Lessons Learned and Reconciliation Commission report, Kudalagama Commission report, the Paranagama Commission report.
ONUR has also taken into account the findings of civil society initiatives, such as Multicultural Vision for Peace and several other initiatives, ONUR officials said here.

CBK asks black flags callers : Tie a rock on leg and jump into Indian Ocean
Office for National Unity and Reconciliation (ONUR) Chairman former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunge yesterday said she would have said to those who called the public to hoist black flags during the Vesak festival that it would have been better for them to jump into the Indian ocean with a rock tied to their legs than to make such utterances.
She said so at a press conference at the ONUR office in the SEMA building Colombo. The calls to hoist black flags instead of the Buddhist flag during the Vesak had come from Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa. Weerawansa said at the Joint Oppositions May Day rally at Gall Face that the visit by Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi during the Vesak festival would not be in favour of the country. The people should hoist black flags during Vesak, he said.

Chelsea one little step from title - Conte
London: Chelsea manager Antonio Conte said his side were "another little step" from the Premier League title after they crushed Middlesbrough 3-0 to move to within touching distance of glory.
Tottenham Hotspur's surprise defeat at West Ham United last week handed Chelsea the initiative and they can now seal a second title triumph in three years if they win at West Bromwich Albion on Friday.
"We're very close. We must be honest. But we need to do another little step and win another game," Conte told reporters after Monday's match, which condemned Middlesbrough to relegation.
"For sure now I'm a bit relaxed. This step was big for us, a big win.
"Now we need to do another step. We have the possibility to do this on Friday against West Brom.
"For sure it won't be easy, because West Brom is a really good team, a physical team, and we must pay great attention.
"We are very close, but we need another step to become champions of the Premier League, which would be a fantastic achievement for us."
While victory at West Brom will deliver the title, Chelsea also have home games against Watford and Sunderland in which to snare the three points they need to make it across the finish line.
Cesc Fabregas was Chelsea's match-winner, inventively creating goals for Diego Costa and Nemanja Matic either side of half-time at a festive Stamford Bridge.
Marcos Alonso also found the net in the first half.
Fabregas began the season on the bench after new signing N'Golo Kante took his place, but he has played an increasingly prominent role in recent weeks.
"Cesc is one of the best examples of our season," Conte said.
"Because in this season, Cesc at the start didn't play a lot. And then through hard work, he improved a lot. And then he's playing in every game.
"This development of Cesc is our development, because we started the season with a lot of problems. But through hard work, together we found the right way.
"Cesc is showing (himself) to be a fantastic player and I'm pleased for him. Because I saw in this season that he put himself in this team in every moment, if he played or didn't play. Now he's deserving this."
Needing victory to stand a realistic chance of preserving their top-flight status, Boro succumbed to a defeat that sent them into the Championship alongside northeast rivals Sunderland.
Conte made a point of saluting Boro's travelling fans after the game.
"It's great to see a team that got relegated and to see the fans clapping the players and the players staying there to receive the applause and to clap the fans," said the Italian.
"It's important to celebrate your win, but also to have great respect and clap this type of situation.
"Because I think this situation happens only in England. In Italy it's very, very difficult to see a team getting relegated and the players receive (applause)."
Boro manager Steve Agnew said his dressing room was "devastated".
"We've worked so hard for a number of years to get back into the Premier League and we know how tough the Premier League is," he said. "Obviously we've come up short."
Agnew, who took over in a caretaker capacity after Aitor Karanka was sacked in March, would not be drawn on whether he would like the role on a permanent basis.
"I don't think it's about my situation. It's about the football club," he said.

China to build a Central Business District in Colombo by 2030

China is building a new city along Colombos coastline that will become the citys central business district by 2030, creating 80,000 jobs for Sri Lankans, under the mainlands Belt and Road Initiative.
Sri Lanka is in urgent need of a high-end platform to attract financial institutions, multinational companies, shoppers, tourists as well as provide jobs for well-educated locals as a part of its post-war reconstruction. The Port City project is planned in the best interests of Sri Lanka, said Sun Ziyu, vice president ofChina Communications Construction Company(CCCC).
With an initial investment of US$1.4 billion, Colombo Port City is Chinas biggest project in Sri Lanka, a key node along the Maritime Silk Road of the Belt and Road plan.
Sun said the development within Sri Lankas biggest commercial city, which will be built on 269 hectares of reclaimed land, would accommodate 200,000 residents and consists of apartments, hotels, offices, shopping malls, exhibition centres, as well as provide 80,000 new jobs. It is expected to be completed by 2030.
Sun said the reclamation work had helped transform the areas coastline which was previously hit by strong winds blowing towards the Indian Ocean that made it less liveable.
[This has] also improved coastal protection, and is a boon to the environment, he said.
Chinas Belt and Road plan comprises a belt of overland corridors and sea routes connecting Asia, Africa and Europe through building infrastructure and boosting financial and trade ties for over 60 countries that lie along the routes.
Belt and Road projects offer huge opportunities, but also present sources of risk for Chinese banks.
In 2016 alone, Chinese firms signed new construction projects worth a total contractual value of US$126 billion. CCCC accounted for one-tenth, or US$12.6 billion of the projects.
It has participated in more than 300 Belt and Road projects across 58 countries. Key projects include the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor, Zemun-Borca Bridge in Serbia and the North-South Highway in Jamaica, with value totaling US$47 billion.
Even with numerous years of overseas experience behind them, Sun said each investment decision was made on repeated verification on multiple fronts of the prospects  from local culture, regulatory policies to environmental issues, as well as soliciting advice from world-class experts. The most important measurement is, the project must benefit local society, he said.
Making profit is important, but if you only consider making money, you will finally lose it. Benefiting others, you will benefit at the end, Sun stressed.
China Telecom Global sets sights on data centres for belt and road region
In Kenya, the company has helped build its first new railway in over 100 years that will begin operations next month. The 480-kilometre track, which replaces the abandoned British-built track, connects the capital Nairobi with East Africas largest port of Mombasa. The US$4 billion construction is also the biggest infrastructure project in Kenya since its independence in 1963.
Sun said the Belt and Road was an open-ended platform and the Chinese way is not the only standard.
Take the railway project. The company was unable to lay the standard Chinese tracks on the black cotton soil in Africa, but had to make adjustments to accommodate local conditions.
To date, CCCC has expanded its footprint in over 140 countries and regions, with major overseas business in Africa, South-east Asia, Oceania, Middle East and Eurasia.
In 2016, new contracts for overseas infrastructure construction signed amounted to 205.9 billion yuan (US$29.8 billion), a 51 per cent increase over the previous year. It has also ventured into Italy and Canada for the first time in 2016, and looks to expand in Europe next, as well as the US.
The companys net profit climbed 8.7 per cent to 17.2 billion yuan in 2016. Revenue gained 6.5 per cent to 429.97 billion yuan, helped by a 16 per cent increase in overseas revenue, which outpaced its domestic sales growth of 5 per cent. Overseas business accounted for a fifth of the companys revenue last year.

It is a matter for regret that the garbage clearing along Peradeniya road, Kandy seems to be very slow and unsatisfactory. The garbage collectors are not regular in collecting the polythene bags of household waste foods and other rotten particles kept outside the houses, hotels and groceries. As a result, the stray dogs often rip the debris bags open and scatter the rotten fruits and vegetables. Some garbage has been taken out of these bags to the middle of the main road by the dogs and birds. This unpleasant scene causes hindrance to the pedestrians and motorists.
Hence, the KMC has a great responsibility to pay heed to discontinuation of this irregular clearing of the garbage dumped here and there along the Peradeniya road which needs cleanliness and proper maintenance because of its close proximity to Kandy city which is a great tourist centre.
As a resident of this area, I fervently appeal to the Municipal authorities to take prompt action against the irregularity of garbage clearing by the workers engaged in this essential service.

Creativity inspired by Vesak
With the dawn of the Vesak season, quite a number of creative activities are observed helping the masses to gather knowledge creatively via interpersonal group and mass communication means.
This has existed since times immemorial as the history records. In the first instance, there is preparation on the part of the adults to disseminate knowledge on aspects of the significance of Vesak, which marks the birth, the attainment of Buddhahood, and entering the Parinibbana or the passing away of Buddha.
Traditionally these are the most significant and most sacred two days in the life of a Buddhist.
It is not only the mere celebration that is significant to the lay Buddhist, but also the search for the insight into various aspects of the doctrine via textual material available.
As such, the adult communicators make it a point to educate and also to entertain the masses via print, visual and sound media.
The Buddhas birth stories have been the stock in trade of most creative communicators, for they make use of these materials in many ways. In village temples the habit of reading birth stories by well-versed monks, in the appropriate tonal expressions, with others listening to it, has been a popular oral tradition handed down the centuries from King Dutugemunus era. The King was so delighted in getting the services of the Buddhist priesthood to read them loudly.
Presumably it is this form that had given way to the Bhakthi Gita (devotional songs) tradition that we hear so often by groups of singers during the Vesak season.
These monks having inculcated the habit of reading aloud mixing a style of prose and verse with tonal variations, selected the birth stories as the subject matter; these monks were vernacularly known as Jataka Bhanakas, the reciters of birth stories.
The Bhanaka tradition is also utilized as a faith healing exercise. In this manner the reading aloud the birth stories have been one of the main items adhered even by the later laymen and then gradually transferred to poetical expressions or versifications giving way to a special ballad creation called Jataka Kavi Katha, the ballads based on birth stories.
During the Kandy period of Sinhala literature, these ballads were proliferated by the learned as well as minor poets not much versed in the language. The birth stories, on versification, enable the listener to remember well the religious essence of the original work.
The poets too believed that it is a way to gain merits if one versifies a birth story and make it available to masses. The later scribes, who transferred the original versifications from the oral sources to the palm leaf manuscripts, were regarded as merit givers and those who listened as merit gatherers.
Similarly episodes from such Sinhala works as Pujavaliya, Saddharma Ratnavaliya and Buthsarana were versified into the simplest forms of communication enabling common readers and listeners to be more knowledgeable in the doctrinal matters at a higher plane of understanding.
The main intention, it is observed, is to create a sense of faith or Saddha, a primary way to achieve higher goals of doctrinal insights.
This too is the intention of the temple painter when he delves in the painting of episodes of birth stories and the life of Prince Siddhartha the would be Buddha, his renunciation, the achievement of Buddhahood, and the various challenges brought about by rivalries symbolizing the prevention of this achievement, for example, the onslaughts of Mara, the death and his daughters, Tanha, Rathi and Ranga, who attempted to entice the mind of the Buddha by their various worldly mundane pranks.
For the common man full of Saddha, this is known as Mara Parajaya or Mara Yuddhaya, the battle against the death. Dealing with the versifications of Dhamma, utilized by the masses in the Buddhist society, one cannot undermine the two Sinhala works Lovada Sangarava and Budu Guna Alankaraya.
Although these two works were meant to be used by the masses in the day-to-day life, the literary critics over the years have not evaluated them as great pieces of literary works as they contain, more or less, didactic commentarial references to good living alluding to the life of the Buddha and the events that followed.
But it is observed that these two works, though not acclaimed as classics, were the common poetry that lived with the masses in search of Buddhist insights inspiring the way to more and more poetical lyrical and dramatic creations that remain as memorable creations up to this day.
The Lovada Sangarava refers to various types of merits and demerits via the utterances of the Buddha, and helps save ones life style from all sins.
One such utterance: if one is sinful, the very act at the spur of the moment is like the partaking of honey which is sweet, but when the very same person receives its retribution it is like the burning from a glowing (karana kalata pav miriya meese vindina kalata duk dadivei ginise).
The subject matter in Budu Guna Alankaraya is the plague that infested the city of Visala to which the poet sought the reasons being the demerits of not only the kings and the rest of beings but also absence of faith and mutual human understanding that should emerge through the insights of the words of the Buddha.
According to the poet, the layman should make it a point to realise the virtues of the Buddha, and recite them day in day out as a necessary expression.
The poet selects the historical episode where the Buddha recited the Ratana Sutta in order to avert the evils that befell the city of Visala, and expands the theme to suit all conditions of human misbehaviour.
In this manner we see that the season of Vesak had given way to a special entity where the masses are made to feel more enlightened on Dhamma insights via reading and listening.
Special local publications are made available to address these insights; Dinamina Vesak Kalapaya is one such example. Many publishers feel that it is a merit-gathering venture to bring out reading material on religious matters especially on this occasion.

Curry leads Warriors rout of Jazz to complete sweep
Los Angeles: Stephen Curry scored 30 points as the Golden State Warriors wrapped up a series sweep with a 121-95 rout of the Utah Jazz on Monday.
The Warriors advanced to a Western Conference finals showdown against either Houston or San Antonio after overcoming a fleeting Utah rally to take the series 4-0 at Salt Lake Citys Vivint Smart Home Arena.
It was a second consecutive 4-0 series victory for the Warriors, who also notched a sweep against Portland in the opening round of the playoffs.
We gotta good thing going, were playing well, Curry said afterward.
Tonight we had an opportunity to seal the deal and thankfully we came out on top, added Curry, praising the Warriors all-round offensive display.
Thats our approach to every game. We dont know whos going to have a hot night. We want to keep that going, he said.
The Warriors laid the foundation for the win with a devastating first quarter performance which saw them pour on 39 points to open up a double-digit lead against a shellshocked Utah.
Guys really came out focused, said Warriors forward Draymond Green, who had a triple-double. We knew what the game plan was and executed that game plan. I think the most important thing, though, is we imposed our will on the game. We had the game at our pace.
The Jazz battled back to reduce the deficit to eight points at half-time at 60-52.
Utah remained in touching distance throughout the third period but the Warriors always looked capable of finding an extra gear when it mattered.
The decisive period came at the end of the third period when both Curry and Andre Iguodala both hit three-pointers in quick succession to help the Dubs pull away to 93-79 heading into the fourth quarter. AFP

A Day for Peace
Hard is it to be born a man; hard is the life of mortals. Hard is it to gain the opportunity of hearing the Sublime Truth, and hard to encounter is the arising of the Buddhas. (The Dhammapada)
Today, Buddhists all over the world celebrate the Birth, Enlightenment and Passing away (Parinibbana) of the Buddha. Hence Buddhists call it a Thrice-Blessed Day. These events occurred on Vesak Poya Days more than 2,500 years ago in what is now India and Nepal. The Buddha is also believed to have visited Sri Lanka three times during the 45 years he spent spreading the Dhamma in the region.
This years Vesak day is especially significant for Sri Lanka, which is hosting the United Nations (UN) Day of Vesak celebrations for the first time, under the theme Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable World Peace. This is a great honour bestowed upon Sri Lanka and our tribute goes to all those who worked tirelessly to make it happen. It is significant that Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who has a deep and abiding interest in Buddhism, is participating in the main events as the Chief Guest along with President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. After all, Buddhism itself was Indias Greatest Gift to Sri Lanka. King Dharmasoka sent his son Arahat Mahinda to Sri Lanka to spread the message of Buddhism in our island, where he met King Devanampiyatissa. The rest, as they say, is history. The President of Nepal, Bidhya Devi Bhandari will participate in the closing ceremonies of the UN Day of Vesak. This is also very significant, since the Buddha was born in Nepal.
At this moment, we must remember with gratitude the true son of the soil who campaigned tirelessly at the UN to gain wider recognition for Vesak internationally  the late Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar. The UN has been celebrating Vesak officially since 1999.
The original decision to make Vesak a special holiday was taken at the World Fellowship of Buddhists (WFB) Conference held in Colombo in 1950. Today, Vesak is a holiday in most Asian countries, including the predominantly Muslim nations of Malaysia and Indonesia. There is greater awareness about Buddhism in Western countries too thanks to the large Asian Diaspora populations who engage in Vesak activities in their adopted countries. In short, Vesak is now a worldwide event and President Sirisena is expected to urge the International Community to proclaim Vesak a global holiday.
In Sri Lanka, where Vesak is celebrated every year on a grand scale, it has transcended ethnic and religious boundaries to become a national festival. Every community takes part in activities related to Vesak such as pandals and dansals. Vesak is a true indicator of religious and communal harmony.
In a way, it is the Buddhist backdrop which enabled Sri Lankans to remain calm and resilient even in the face of the cruelest forms of adversity such as the war and the tsunami. As the Buddha enunciated, hatred does not cease by hatred  it ceases by love alone. A culture inspired by Buddhism has permeated the heart of every Sri Lankan regardless of community and religion. Buddhism is a unifying force in this country and indeed, in many others.
However, many religious leaders have expressed dismay at the level of commercialization of our main national festivals, including Vesak. This could result in the danger of the original message of the festival getting lost in a torrent of commercialism. It is imperative that we get back to our roots  the temple-village-school nexus held the social fabric together in the days of yore. Crime was minimal as everyone harboured good thoughts and engaged in good deeds. We have veered away from religious and moral values to a great extent in the relentless pursuit of material wealth, which has resulted in anti-social behaviour.
Despite the belief that the Buddha Dhamma is a very complex philosophy that offers little for day-to-day life, the Dhamma in fact offers guidance for lay people to lead pious and contended lives. In fact, Singalovada is an entire Sutra dedicated for lay men and women who want to lead their lives according to Buddhist tenets. Anyone can follow these tenets to lead a happy life. The Buddhas words are timeless and apt even 2,500 years later.
This Vesak, when international focus is on Sri Lanka, must be thought of as a turning point in our history. Sri Lanka is on the cusp of entering an era of lasting peace through a new Constitution that will enable all Sri Lankans to live in harmony, forging a truly Sri Lankan identity. Buddhism can be a guiding and uniting force, as it has always been, to show us the way forward. This is also the only way to defeat extremists on all sides who want to use religion for their own sinister ends. Religious leaders have a major role to play in defeating such ominous plans for discord and rancor. As the Buddha espoused, peace is the one option that we should pursue.

## Title: Death, scared away
## Supertitle:

Death, scared away
Vesak marks Buddhas Birth, Enlightenment and Parinibbana [death]. The bitter truth about death is that, when it comes to somebody in the family or friend it is important but totally irrelevant when someone unknown dies. We grieve only if it affects us or me
What you accomplish in your life, gives death its power. Achieve much, and death comes calmly. Accomplish little, and death becomes an annoyance, a persistence timer always ticking louder and louder as you understand more and more that you have completed little or nothing with the time available to you.
Is Death Mysterious
Life continues in a repetitive pattern, and it tends to degenerate. The pattern varies according to climate, according to country, and according to circumstances, but it is a pattern. Moving in any pattern tends to continue and that continuity is a component of the degenerating process of a being. At the ending of continuity, something new takes place. One can comprehend it instantly if one has understood the entire movement of thought, hate, of fear, love - then one can take hold of the significance, directly, of what death is. Take the question of death which is an enormous problem to people. Death is always walking by your side. Can one meet it so completely that it does not create a problem of it at all In order to meet it like that all hope, all belief, all fear about it must move toward to an end, otherwise you are meeting this strange thing with a winding up, an image, with an intentional anxiety, and as a result you are meeting it with time.
Life, Soul and Death
Belief in an immortal soul has dominated mans thoughts since the time he became homo erectus, the possessors of this eternal ideal are assured of ceaseless life. Guarantees and assurances of the souls future prospects offer wings to our fantasies. You cannot be scared of the unknown since you do not know what the unusual is and so there is nothing to be anxious of. Death is only a word, and it is the word, the image, that generates fear. Can you look at death without the image of death As long as the image subsists from which spring reflection, thought must always create panic. Then you either lessen your fear of death or build a disagreement against the inevitable or you invent numerous beliefs to guard you from the fear of death. Hence there is a space between you and the thing of which you are scared. In this time-space gap there must be conflict which is anxiety, fear and self-pity.
Thought, which breeds the fear of death, suggests postponement of it, let's avoid it, keep it as remote as possible, let's not reflect upon it' - but you are thinking about it. When you say, `I do not think about it', you have already deliberated out how to avoid it. You are scared of death because you have deferred it.
We have accepted life with all its agony and misery and have got used to it, and imagine of death as some- thing to be cautiously avoided. But death is amazingly like life when we know how to live. You cannot exist without dying. You cannot live if you do not die psychologically every moment.
This is not a rational paradox. To live wholly, wholly, every day as if it were a new loveliness, there must be disappearing to everything of yesterday, otherwise you live unconsciously, and such a mind can never know what love is or what independence is.
Sir Francis Story in his work titled, Rebirth as Doctrine and Experience says,
Soul is an ambiguous term that has never been clearly defined in Western religious or philosophical thought, but it is generally taken to mean the sum total of an individual personality, an enduring ego-entry that exists more or less independently of the physical body and survives it after death.
The soul is considered to be the personality factor which distinguishes one individual from another, and is supposed to consist of the elements of consciousness, mind, character, and all that goes to make up the psychic, immaterial side of a human being.
Death is Frightening
We are frightened of dying since we don't know what it means to live. We don't know how to exist; therefore we don't know how to die. As long as we are scared of life we shall be frightened of death. The man who is not worried of life is not frightened of being completely insecure for he understands that secretly, psychologically, there is no security..
To find out really what takes place when you pass away you must die. You must die - not physically but psychologically, privately, die to the things you have treasured and to the things you are bitter about. If you have died to one of your delights, the smallest or the greatest, obviously, without any enforcement or fight, then you will know what it means to die. To die is to have a mind that is totally empty of itself, empty of its daily yearning, pleasure; and agonies. Death is a regeneration, a mutation, in which reflection does not function at all because thought is old. When there is death there is something completely new. independence from the known is death, and then you are existing. If there is not freedom from the known one cannot possibly find out what death is, which is the ending of the whole thing, the physical organism with all its embedded habits, the identification with the body, with the name, with all the recollections it has acquired. One cannot take it all over when one goes to death. So, in the same way one has to end in life everything that one knows. That means there is complete aloneness; not loneliness but aloneness, in the sense there is nothing else but that state of mind that is totally whole. Aloneness means all one.
What is death Thought has many answers. It says: I do not want to go into all the miserable clarifications of death. Every living being has an answer to it, according to his desire, according to his conditioning, his hope. The answer will consistently be intellectual, verbally put together by thought. But one is exploratory, without having an answer, something entirely unknown, totally mysterious - death is an incredible thing.
The brain is the storehouse of memory; memory as experience, as acquaintance. From that experience and knowledge, stored up in the cells of the brain, thought arises. When the living being comes to an end, the brain also comes to an end, and so thought comes to an end. Thought is a material course - thought is nothing spiritual - it is based on memory held in the cells of the brain; thought dies when the organism dies. Thought creates the whole structure of the me - that wants this, the me that does not want that, the me that is fearful, despairing, anxious, yearning - fearful of dying.
What is Before Death
Instead of the usual, What happens after death Ask,What is before death. Before death is one's life and what is one's life Eat and drink, go to school, to university, employment, marry, live together, work for 40- 50 years, have children, anxiety and pain, fighting. Life is such a miserable one, but one wants to know what happens after death. Volumes have been written on it, all created by thought, all saying, Believe. Put all that aside, literally, actually, then what is one faced with - The actual fact that self who is put together by thought, comes to an end - all one's, all one's longings and anxieties come to an end. I am living in all energy, vigour and capacity, and death means a conclusion to that living. But, can I live with death all the time : I am attached to you; end that attachment, which is death - is it not You are greedy and when you die, you cannot carry greed with you; so end the greed, never postpone- end it, now. So you are living a life full of energy, vigour, capacity, observation, and also the ending of that instantaneously, which is death. So to live before death is to live with death; which means that you are living in a timeless world. You are living a life in which everything that you acquire is frequently ending, so that there is always a fantastic movement, you are not fixed in a certain place. This is not a concept. When you invite death, which means the ending of everything that you hold, dying to it, each moment, then you will find - not one there is then no oneself finding it, since one has gone - then there is that state of ageless dimension in which the movement we call time, is not.
It means the emptying of the content of your consciousness so that there is no time; time gets nearer to an end, which is death.
The fear of death follows from fear of life, A man who lives fully is prepared to die at anytime.
- Mark Twain

EC to meet over Geetha ouster
Elections Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya, confirming the receipt of Parliament Secretary Generals letter that the Parliamentary seat of Geetha Kumarasinghe has fallen vacant, said the Elections Commission would meet shortly and take appropriate action.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the Chairman said the preliminary steps in this regard have already been taken. Parliamentary Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake on Monday informed the Elections Commission in writing that the Parliamentary seat of Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe has been annulled in line with the Court of Appeal verdict on May 3.
Upon receipt of this letter, the Elections Commission has to publish in the Gazette the name of the UPFA member who has received the next highest votes in the Galle district after Kumarasinghe. Former Minister Piyasena Gamage is the UPFA Galle district candidate next in line.
However, actress turned politician Geetha Kumarasinghe filed an appeal with the Supreme Court yesterday over the Appeal Court decision disqualifying her from holding the Parliamentary seat on the grounds that she was holding dual citizenship.
Elections Commission senior officer M. M. Mohemed told the Daily News that the Commission could go ahead unless there is a restraining order by the Supreme Court preventing the Commission from issuing the Gazette until the appeal is heard.
The Elections Commission headed by Deshapriya and comprising members Nalin Abeysekara and Prof. Ratnajeevan Hoole would meet shortly and decide on the future course of action. Deshapriya said the Commission hopes to make a collective decision in this regard.

England deservedly Champions Trophy favourites - Swann
England are justified favourites for the Champions Trophy on home soil next month, says ex-spinner Graeme Swann.
They beat Ireland by 85 runs at Lords to complete a 2-0 win - their seventh one-day series victory in two years.
England have got such a strong-looking squad, especially with the bat, Swann told Test Match Special.
 Swann, who took 104 wickets in 79 one-day internationals, was referring to the 2015 World Cup when Eoin Morgans team were humbled by a group-stage exit, in which they only won games against minnows Scotland and Afghanistan.
Since then, England have won series against World Cup runners-up New Zealand, Pakistan (twice), Sri Lanka, Bangladesh, West Indies and now Ireland. They only lost to Australia and South Africa by the odd game in five.
They hammered Ireland despite the absence of key men Ben Stokes and Jos Buttler, who are playing in the Indian Premier League.
Swann added: They have such a strong middle order. Especially when you consider they can bring in Jos Buttler - one of the best in the world - and add him to that middle order and then Ben Stokes, who is arguably the best player in the world in all formats.
Eoin Morgan and (head coach) Trevor Bayliss ripped up that piece of paper from 2015 and said thats nonsense, well get the right personnel in, fill them with confidence, back them to the hilt and ask them to try and post 400 when they bat.
They scored 328 against Ireland and the captain said he felt they were 40 runs short. Thats amazing to hear. Not too long ago, England captains and teams of old would have been cock-a-hoop with a score of 328.
Its not long ago they were being thrashed by everyone and insisting they were playing the right way with their 1970s brand of one-day cricket.  BBC

Geetha seeks SC remedies over Parliamentary seat
Galle District MP Geetha Kumarasinghe yesterday filed an appeal in the Supreme Court challenging the Court of Appeal judgment declaring that Geetha Kumarasinghe is disqualified to be a Member of Parliament and thus not entitled to hold this office.
Through this appeal petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe sought an order to set aside the judgment dated May 3, 2017 by Court of Appeal.
The petitioner further sought an interim order to stay the operation of the judgment made in the writ application bearing No.CA Writ 362/2015 by Court of Appeal. This petition will be taken up for support on May 12.
In this petition, Geetha Kumarasinghe had cited N.W.E. Buwaneka of Beddegama, J.K. Amarawardhana of Yatalamatta, A.C. Gunasekara of Unawatuna, J.K. Wijesinghe of Ambalangoda and H.L. Prasanna Deepthilal of Galle, Controller General of Immigration and Emigration, the Attorney General and several others as respondents.
Delivering its judgment on the writ petition filed by five residents of Galle district, the Court of Appeal on March 3 held that in terms of the Article 91(1) (d) (xiii) of the constitution, the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe is not qualified to be elected as a Member of Parliament since she holds dual citizenship of both Switzerland and Sri Lanka.
The Court of Appeal had further directed the Attorney General to take necessary steps to formulate a mechanism to recover the expenses caused to state by Geetha Kumarasinghe while she was functioning as a Parliamentarian to sit and vote in Parliament.
This is the first time in Sri Lanka the qualifications of a Parliamentarian had been challenged through a writ petition over a dual citizenship issue.
The Court of Appeal maintained that a report submitted by the Department of Immigration and Emigration by August 2015 had confirmed that the first respondent Geetha Kumarasinghe was holding dual citizenship.

Indian Prime Minister Modi meets Upcountry Tamil community : Unrelenting upkeep
The meeting of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi with the Upcountry Tamil community at the Norwood Sports Complex in the Nuwara Eliya District on May 12 is historical.
Several Indian political leaders have visited Sri Lanka and made it a point to meet the Upcountry Tamil Community. However, Prime Minister Modis visit deserves special mention.
The visit of Jawarhallal Nehru in 1939, the then leader of the Indian Congress party, who later became the first Prime Minister of India, is very often remembered. In 1939, several social organisations based on several trade and caste were representing the Indians.
Sri Lankan Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi going for a meeting at Hyderabad House on September 15, 2015 in New Delhi, India.
It was Nehru, who advised them to form one organisation, which resulted in the formation of the Ceylon Indian Congress, which later became Ceylon Workers Congress. If compared with the visit of Nehru in 1939 with the present visit of Prime Minister Modi, the political and social environment of the country in general and the Up-Country Tamil Community in particular, has changed significantly.
Although the Indian Tamils enjoyed voting rights, after the independence, the citizenship rights was deprived. Thereafter, the citizenship of the community was the major issue between the two countries until an agreement was reached between the two Prime Ministers Sirima and Shastri in 1964, whereby half of the population was made to repatriate to India.
With the repatriation of over 500,000 persons and resolving the citizenship issue in 2003, the political stability of the country was achieved. Majority of the Upcountry Tamils who were confined to the tea and rubber plantation in economic and social isolation entered the mainstream. This development process has to be accelerated. Modis visit should be a landmark in the acceleration process.
At present, Sri Lanka is drafting a new constitution in which demand of this community to safeguard their political and civil rights should be met, so that their due representation at the various political levels, will be ensured. There should be political arrangement in the event of power devolution and electoral reforms that ensure that these people could enjoy the political rights in relation to other communities. The community has to be recognised as a district ethnic community which has separate cultural and social economic identities different from other communities. It is the wish of the community that the concerns of the people should be taken up with the leaders of the government by the visiting Prime Minister. Moreover, there is a demand to ensure economic, social and cultural rights. The community is yet to enjoy the land and housing ownership rights. In the development arena, social development indicators reveal that the community lags behind particularly in terms of poverty level, nutrition and educational attainment and health status. Due to lack of educational attainment, participation of the community in the public service at the higher level is nil. University admission is less than 1 percent of the total intake of the national universities. Large scale migration from the plantation sector to unskilled occupations in the urban sector is commonly observed. Leavers of the secondary and upper secondary schools do not have proper facilities to advance their academic, vocational, or technical skills.
Past assistance
In this scenario, assistance and interventions by India is viewed by the community as a moral obligation since it is historically linked to India and continued to maintain cultural links.
In the past, Indian assistance to the community is noteworthy. Specific mention can be made in five areas; education, housing, vocational training, transport, and health. As far as education is concerned, the Ceylon Estate Workers Education Trust (CEWET) was instituted in 1947 on the initiative taken by M.S. Aney, the representative of India in Ceylon.
It started with financial assistance to four students in 1947. It is remarkable that the Trust continues to provide assistance to the students who aspire to pursue their higher studies. At present, the CEWET offers financial assistance for 350 students who qualify at the GCE O/L to follow A/L classes (225 students) and others at the national universities and colleges. The funds for the Trust are mobilised by its members and supplemented by the GOI. It should be noted that to obtain the benefit from the scheme, the students should be estate workers children. Through this scheme, a few hundred students have become graduates, which includes graduates of medicine and engineering. At present, the number who qualify for A/L is on the increase, so the expansion of assistance by the Trust should be considered.Related to vocational training, the Thondaman Vocational Training Centre (TVTC) established in Hatton under NORADs assistance is the only centre providing the vocational training needs for the community. Major issue is the non-availability of Tamil medium instructors. In order to overcome this issue, from 2011 to 2017, several Tamil instructors were provided to the TVTC.
An MOU is to be signed with Cabinet approval between the governments of Sri Lanka and India to upgrade the centre, providing equipment and building at a cost of Rs. 199 million.
With the assistance of Indian Government, training programmes have been undertaken for teachers in specific subjects such as Mathematics and Science. A number of teachers have undergone training in India and master trainers have come to Sri Lanka to train the teachers. A one-year graduation programme for Science teachers was conducted in which selected teachers were given training and sent for graduation in India.
In order to overcome the transport difficulties in the plantation region, the Indian government gave around 40 mini buses to commute between the estates and the nearby towns. These buses were distributed in the Nuwara Eliya, Badulla, and Ratnapura districts. However, the effectiveness of this assistance has to be assessed.
Another important area is the health sector. A base hospital at Glencairn, Dikoya was constructed at a cost of Rs.1200 million with funding from India. Although the construction commenced in 2011 and completed in 2015, due to the delays in the procurement of equipment and sharing responsibility between the central government and the provincial council, the commencement of the hospital was postponed. Finally, Prime minister Modi is to open it on May 12.
Housing is another area where Indian assistance was provided for. India provided 50,000 houses to Internally Displaced Persons (IDPS) in the Northern Province. Later, plantation sector was also included in this programme where 4,000 houses at a cost of Rs 1 million on grant basis were provided. At present, constructing these houses is in progress, and they are expected to be completed within the next two years.
Request for future assistance
Housing requirements in the plantation amounts to over 160,000. Local funding is not enough to meet this huge demand. A proposal to construct another 20,000 houses was submitted in 2015 and it awaits response from the GOI with the Cabinet approval. The community eagerly awaits a response from Indian Government. Another important area is education. With the expansion of higher secondary education, Upcountry Tamil students who qualify for the entrance to university have increased significantly. However, the admission to the national universities is limited. The CEWET has given scholarships to only around 100 students. In order to provide facilities to deserving students to pursue their higher studies, a fully funded scholarship for 100 Upcountry Tamil students on various degree courses in India should be considered on an urgent basis.
All other communities except the Upcountry Tamils have a university. Establishing a separate university for the community is a long-standing demand to promote research in the history as well as cultural and social issues of the community. A separate university is essential. The GOI should assist in conducting a feasibility study to fulfil this demand.
Those who are unable to enter universities should have access to technical colleges. Here again, admission to the technical colleges is not feasible due to language and other difficulties. Therefore, a separate technical college to cater the needs of the Indian Origin Tamils is a very essential.Training to teachers have been provided earlier and has not been continued. Training for teachers in key subjects - Mathematics, IT, Biology, Physics, Chemistry, English and Management is considered as a necessary intervention to provide quality education. Selected teachers should be provided with short and long-erm training.
Upgrading plantation schools have been undertaken by the SIDA and the GTZ in the past and the Government of Sri Lanka continues this activity providing limited funds. Over 100 Tamil schools need upgrading in terms of physical facilities to provide quality education on a priority basis. This requirement should be considered by the GOI.Modis visit has provided an opportunity for the community to put forward the concerns in relation to their rights and development requirements where Indian Government could assist. It has provided assistance in various fields in the past as explained. Several other countries particularly Norway (NORAD), Sweden (SIDA), Germany (GTZ) have made notable contributions to the Social Development of the plantation community. It is the wish of the community that India should do more as it has a moral obligation towards the well-being of the community.

Inflation down in April
The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100) based headline inflation decelerated on a year-on-year basis to 6.9 per cent in April 2017 from 7.3 per cent in March 2017.
The CCPI based core inflation also decelerated to 6.8 per cent in April 2017 from 7.3 per cent recorded in the previous month, the Central Bank said yesterday.
It is expected that inflation based on the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which edged up in March 2017, will also display a similar decline in April 2017. Supported by monetary policy adjustments from end 2015, inflation is projected to decelerate gradually to the desired mid-single digit levels by end 2017, although there could be some monthly fluctuations due to short term supply side disruptions and the base effects of tax revisions in 2016.
With the upward adjustment in market interest rates, the year-on-year growth of credit extended to the private sector by commercial banks decelerated gradually to 21.0 per cent by end February 2017 and 20.4 per cent by end March 2017, from 21.9 per cent recorded at end 2016.
However, despite the deceleration observed during the first two months of 2017, the year-on-year growth of broad money (M2b) remained high at 20.0 per cent in March 2017 compared to 18.4 per cent at end 2016 mainly on account of the expansion in credit to both private and public sectors in absolute terms during the month.
This included the expansion of credit to public corporations, some of which were affected by the impact of the drought and increased international energy prices. As market interest rates remain substantially high, both in nominal and real terms, it is expected that credit extended to the private sector will decelerate to the envisaged levels by end 2017.
In the external sector, the cumulative trade deficit increased to US dollars 1.7 billion in the first two months of 2017 from US dollars 1.2 billion in the same period of 2016. This was a reflection of the combined impact of the decline in export earnings and increased expenditure on imports, particularly as a result of the drought conditions.
Tourist arrivals and related earnings improved in the first four months of 2017 in spite of the partial closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport during the first quarter, although there was a moderation in inflows from workers remittances during the first quarter of the year.
Both the government securities market and the Colombo Stock Exchange experienced foreign inflows in recent months, while the government issued its 11th International Sovereign Bond (ISB) worth US dollars 1.5 billion this month, priced favourably at 6.2 per cent.
These inflows, along with other expected financial inflows to the government and the likely disbursement of the 3rd tranche under the IMF Extended Fund Facility (EFF), would support the balance of payments and the country's reserve position.
As at end April 2017, gross official reserves were estimated at US dollars 5.0 billion compared to US dollars 6.0 billion at end 2016, while the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 1.5 per cent against the US dollar during the year up to 05 May 2017.
The Monetary Board will maintain the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending FacilityRate (SLFR) of the Central Bank unchanged at 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively.

King Arthur: Legend of the Sword review [Video]

Guy Ritchies cheerfully ridiculous Arthur is a gonzo monarch, a death-metal warrior-king. Ritchies film is at all times over the top, crashing around its digital landscapes in all manner of beserkness, sometimes whooshing along, sometimes stuck in the odd narrative doldrum.
But it is often surprisingly entertaining, and whatever clunkers he has delivered in the past, Ritchie again shows that a film-maker of his craft and energy commands attention, and part of his confidence in reviving King Arthur resides here in being so unselfconscious and unconcerned about the student canon that has gone before: Malory, Tennyson, Bresson, Graham Chapman, John Cleese, Eric Idle etc. Instead, Ritchie launches into an all-purpose tale of medieval brigands and scofflaws.
Its more of a laugh than Antoine Fuquas solemn take in 2004.
Arthur and the Round Table knights are more like Robin Hood and the merry geezers, a tale of right lairy thieves, and Ritchies story of their supernatural-assisted insurrection against the forces of tyranny cheerfully pinches bits of The Lion King and Gladiator and The Hobbit and Testaments Old and New; and he even has a talking-into-a-severed-ear joke nicked from Reservoir Dogs.
Its unsubtle to say the very least, in the same way that Iron Maiden is unsubtle. But maybe subtlety is the wrong approach.
At any rate, Ritchie has his head firmly in the speaker bin, and at one stage an evil character even winces and cringes with a ringing in his ears, as if he has been doing the same thing.
Arthurs dad is of course Uther Pendragon, played by Eric Bana, who is betrayed by his panto evil brother Vortigern, a pop-eyed, pursed-lipJude Law.
The tiny infant Arthur makes a fortuitous escape with everything but a basket of rushes and finds himself growing up with a right bunch of apple-cheeked cutpurses and associates of ladies of the night by the river in a quaint place called Londinium.
It is there that Ritchie unveils one of his hypercaffeinated, hyperdrive speeded-up sequences, taking us through Arthurs journey from childhood to young manhood in a matter of minutes: the sheer effrontery, and its undoubted breezy skill raises a laugh.
Having ensconced Arthur as the emerging young leader of a crew, Ritchie brings in such repertory stalwarts as Geoff Bell (bad guy) and Neil Maskell (good guy) for this den of dodginess, and they are entirely at home.
Wicked Vortigern is ever paranoid about the rumoured youngling who might one day defeat him, and who is the only one capable of extracting a certain sword from a rock that forms the bizarre centrepiece to his Angkor Wat-style medieval palace complex.
All the men of a certain age are rounded up and forced to attempt this feat, not knowing what it portends, and when Arthur can actually do it and then gets away, it looks as if he will be able to command a kind of prototypical resistance government composed of disaffected nobles and stout-hearted ruffians, including Bill (Aidan Gillen) and Bedivere (Djimon Hounsou).
But there is no Merlin: a big flaw in this movie. Presumably the famous wizard is being saved up for one of the many followups in the franchise series in the pipeline, which may or may not arrive. (We are still waiting for the rest of those Narnia films, by the way.)
What we do have is the Mage, in the form of Astrid Bergs-Frisbey, a person of magic skills and the one female character in the knightly sausage party; she is possessed of a gaunt beauty, and eyeballs that tend to turn completely black in the ecstasy of magic.
It is the Mage, who  and its a bit of a narrative cheat, this but allowable in a fabular context  can get Arthur and his guys out of a jam. Most impressively, she conjures a gigantic snake, after forcing Arthur to let a normal-sized one bite him. Its a very creepy, and rather exciting scene.
When Merlin turns up, probably in the next film, that is going to be a big show-off role and my money is on Robert Downey Jr.
Its reasonably good fun and theres a great assassination scene in which the director himself puts in a cameo as a frowning householder.
The film rattles along exhilaratingly, if sometimes intermittently, like a fairground rollercoaster that occasionally stops and makes you get out and walk for a few minutes before letting you back on.

Lanka blessed with greatest gift of Buddhism: President
The year 2561 B.C. dawned, marking the commencement of the golden era in the Buddhist history of Sri Lanka. I believe it is an incomparable prestige that our Motherland, as a place where the Buddha visited on three occasions, receives the opportunity to hold the United Nations International Vesak Festival. This is the foremost gift bestowed on us since Sri Lanka was blessed with the greatest gift, the teachings of the Buddha, stated President Maithripala Sirisena in a message marking Vesak. The message added: Offering the pivotal role for us in the 14th UN International Vesak Festival certainly demonstrates the recent victories we have achieved in the international arena. All the citizens of Sri Lanka, who contributed to this accomplishment, will be added to the history as devotees, who benefitted from this meritorious deed. This years theme for the International Vesak Festival is Buddhist Teachings for Social Justice and Sustainable Peace.
The key condition for social justice is equality. The Buddhist teachings also give prominence to this universal concept of equality. The equality, which is demanded by the contemporary world, had been taken into discussion during the period of the Buddha 2561 years ago. The Buddha said peace which is the key factor of the existence of human beings can only be built in a healthy society where equality has been established. Our historical chronicle which starts with the Nibbana of the Buddha will enter a new path with Sri Lanka hosting the International Vesak Festival this year. With that pride, let us determine to commit to rise in the global society by overcoming petty boundaries.
I wish the Buddhist population in the entire world a joyful and peaceful Vesak! the message stated.

Moves to boost transparency in govt securities market
Three major policy measures have been taken by the Central Bank to increase transparency in the government securities market. The matter was drawn to the attention of the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando made the commission aware of these measures while referring to a press release issued by the Central Bank on May 3.
Fernando submitted the press release arguing against Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghes opposition to an auction method only system.
Fernando, quoting the Press Release said the Central Bank has taken a policy measure to give approval of the Monetary Board to launch a new monthly public auction system for treasury bonds.
Fernando questioned as to why Dr. Weerasinghe is supporting a direct placement method which has given room to discrepancies.
It was pointed out that another policy measure by the Central Bank, is the commencement of a Cabinet approved procurement process to establish a secondary market electronic trading platform inclusive of a new central counter party and clearing and settlement system.
The third policy measure is overhaul of regulatory and supervisory system with rules and principles to promote market discipline.

All of Sri Lanka's 399 runners endorsed by local sporting stars, Lahiru Thirimanna, Sudharshan Muthutanthri, Niroshan Dickwella, Tillekeratne Dilshan, Hasitha Perera and Randhir Witana led the pack from the start line at Independence Square at 4.30pm.
The atmosphere at the Independence Square Memorial Ground was electric with a festival like atmosphere from food stalls, entertainment from some of Sri Lanka's most renowned singers and a screening of the Wings for Life World Run. Sri Lanka was proud to raise a total of Rs. 640,000 from the day for spinal cord injury research.

Overcoming Ill Will
How to change the way we interact with those who anger us:
As a practice that trains the mind to become gentle and considerate, metta is a powerful method to dissolve our habits of thinking about, speaking to, and treating others with ill will.
In the Discourse on Repression of Ill Will (Aghata Vinaya Sutta), Sariputta, one of the Buddhas leading disciples, offers five practices for overcoming ill will and practicing loving-friendliness. These examples show us simple ways to think about complex, difficult situations. When we are with others, as our metta is sprouting in our hearts, we may face situations that challenge us. We know that we need to overcome whatever ill will remains in our minds toward others, but we are tempted to fall into old patterns of judging and distancing ourselves from them. These practices offer a different way of interacting with people who anger us. The Dirty Rag
We may come across people whose words are kind, but whose bodily behavior is not. They make promises they cant keep and act evasively, or say nice things to us but act poorly. We can consider behaving toward them like the monk who, while walking down the road, comes across a dirty rag. The rag is so filthy he cant even pick it up with his hands, so he holds it with one foot while he kicks it with the other foot to clean it off. Then he picks it up with two fingers, shakes it off, brings it home, and washes it. He sees that this once-dirty rag is in fact completely functional and he sews it onto his patchwork robes!
When we encounter people whose deeds are not good but whose words are pleasant, we can search for ways to arouse loving-friendliness within ourselves. We can certainly find one reason or another to do sowe can grasp onto their kind words in the same way the monk saw the value of the cloth obscured by dirt. We admire and respect these people for their words and arouse our own loving-friendliness to share with them. If we are able to associate with them and show them loving-friendliness, it might encourage them to change their way of acting. But we do not pay attention to their actions. Focusing on and encouraging others positive words gives their kindness room to blossom naturally. Additionally, when we learn to practice compassion and equanimity toward people in this way, our own thoughts of ill will toward them are subdued.
Keep in mind that the layers of conditioning on a person have made them difficult to handle, just like the layers of dirt on the cloth. Perhaps they have faced hardship unknown to ussuch as losing a friend or family member, home, or job. Maybe they were mistreated or abused as a child and this contributed to their thinking that rough behavior is a normal part of life. What matters for us is that we see that someone is suffering. We can offer them our loving-friendliness. The Algae-Covered Pond
Next, consider how you become angry with a person whose speech is unkind but whose actions are respectful. For example, someone disparages you for doing a task incorrectly but then does the task for you so that you can learn from them. Sariputta compares this type of person to a pond covered with algae. Say that there is a pond nearby on a hot day when you are very thirsty. You are sweaty and feeling exhausted, and a cool dip would feel so refreshing. But the pond is covered with algae, so how do you dive in First you must clear the algae away with both hands.
Similarly, you can overlook this persons challenges and recognize that their heart opens to compassion and loving-friendliness from time to time. On this basis, you develop loving-friendliness toward that person. The ill will you may have felt toward them diminishes on its own. The Hoofprint Puddle. The third type of person speaks both unwholesome words and does unwholesome deeds, but from time to time their heart opens to noble, friendly, and compassionate things. Sariputta suggests that such a person can be compared to a puddle on the road. Suppose you are walking along a road and there is no water or well. You are thirsty and tired, desperately looking for water. Almost dehydrated, you find a little rainwater that has collected in the hoofprint of a cow in the middle of the road.
Theres very little water, and if you try to scoop it up by hand, youll make it muddy. What to do You kneel down and slowly bring your mouth to that bit of water and sip it without disturbing the mud, thus quenching your thirst.
From time to time, even with their bad words and deeds, youll find that this persons heart opens to loving-friendliness, compassion, appreciative joy, and equanimity. When you recognize a moment when their heart is open, take advantage of itenter quickly. Say some loving words to keep their heart open.

Prof. Ananda Samarasekaras revision application re-fixed for inquiry
The inquiry into a revision application filed by former Colombo Chief Medical Officer Prof. Ananda Samarasekara challenging the Colombo Magistrates Court order to reject anticipatory bail for him over the alleged loss of body parts of rugby player Wasim Thajudeen was yesterday re-fixed for July 7 by Colombo High Court.
In his revision application, Prof. Samarasekara had cited CID Homicide Investigations Unit OIC and the Attorney General as the respondents. At a previous occasion, former Colombo Chief JMO and Vice Chancellor of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) Prof. Ananda Samarasekara had filed an anticipatory bail application in Court to pre-empt the possibility of his arrest on charges of a non-bailable offence relating to the alleged loss of body parts of Thajudeen. On September 15, 2016 Colombo Additional Magistrate Dulani Amarasinghe refused to grant anticipatory bail on the former JMO, citing that the investigation pertaining to the loss of body parts of Thajudeen could be hampered if the petitioner was granted anticipatory bail.

## Title: Reflections on Buddhist vinaya

Reflections on Buddhist vinaya
In the Maha-parinibbana Sutta, the Buddha taught: "Now, Ananda, if it occurs to any of you -- 'the teaching has lost its authority; we are without a Teacher' -- do not view it in that way. Whatever Dhamma and Vinaya I have pointed out and formulated for you, that will be your Teacher when I am gone."
The Buddha calls his teaching the Dhamma and the Vinaya, and these two cannot separate from each other. The Vinaya is the "life" of the Buddha Sasana. The Sasana is alive only when the Vinaya prevails, and prevalence of the Vinaya depends on those who observe and practice it strictly.
The Vinaya Pitaka, the first division of the Tripitaka, is the textual framework upon which the monastic community (Sangha) is built, and includes the code of rules that defines the way of life of bhikkhus and bhikkhunis. It also details the many rules, procedures, and forms of etiquette that are necessary to support harmonious relations, both among the monastics themselves, and between the monastics and their lay supporters, upon whom they depend.
For nearly twenty years after the Enlightenment of the Buddha, no definite rules were laid down for control and discipline of the Sangha (Order). As the Sangha gradually grew in number and evolved into a more complex society, occasions inevitably arose when a member would act in an unskilful way. Whenever those cases were brought to the Buddha's attention, he would lay down vinaya rules establishing suitable punishments for the offences, as deterrents to future misconduct.
Reasons for the promulgated of rules, their various implications and specific ceremonies of the Sangha are fully described in the Vinaya Pitaka.
Practical lessons
The monastic tradition and the rules upon which it is built are sometimes navely criticized as irrelevant to the "modern" practice of Buddhism. Some see the Vinaya as a throwback to an archaic patriarchy, based on a hodgepodge of ancient rules and customs that only obscure the essence of "true" Buddhist practice. This view misses one crucial fact: it is to the credit of the unbroken lineage of Sangha that have consistently upheld and protected the rules of the Vinaya for almost 2,600 years that we find ourselves today with the luxury of receiving the priceless teachings of Dhamma. Were it not for the Vinaya, and for those who continue to keep it alive to this day, there would be no Buddhism.
Lay practitioners will find the Vinaya Pitaka filled with valuable practical lessons concerning human nature, guidance on how to establish and maintain a harmonious community or organization, as well as profound teachings of the Dhamma itself. But its greatest value, perhaps, lies in its power to inspire the layperson to consider the extraordinary possibilities offered by a life of true renunciation, lived in harmony with the Dhamma.
A bhikkhu is bound to observe t227 rules (apart from several other minor ones) which include four kinds of Higher Morality, namely: Patimokkha Sila -- the Fundamental Moral Code (major offenses related to immoral, cruel, harmful and selfish activities.), Indriyasamvara Sila -- Morality pertaining to sense-restraint, Ajivaparisuddhi Sila -- Morality pertaining to purity of livelihood and Paccayasannissita Sila -- Morality pertaining to the use of requisites pertaining to life. These four kinds of morality are collectively called Sila-Visuddhi (Purity of Virtue).
These precepts and rules remain as pertinent today as they were 2,600 years ago for they restore the focus back to the human being, to how actions and words affect individuals and the world
For the Bhikkhu, the Vinaya helps to highlight actions and speech, and show up their significance. It brings an awareness of how he is intervening in the world, how he is affecting other people. Of course, such awareness is necessary for every human being, not just Bhikkus. This is why Buddha bequeathed to laymen the Five, the Eight and the Ten Precepts.
Training
In the Mangala Sutta the Buddha teaches that one should be well-trained in Vinaya. The term well-trained in discipline is explained in the commentary on the Sutta as follows: There are two kinds of Vinaya, one for laity and the other for monks. The lay Vinaya means avoidance of the ten unwholesome kammas. A lay person shuns these ten evil kammas with a pure heart and humble attitude. With the aim of not spoiling his morality he respectfully observes the training in full. Here the words well-trained in discipline encompass two factors: purification of defilements, and devoted practice of moral discipline. These two essential factors should be learned and practised by the laity.
Regarding the monks Vinaya, the commentary explains that a monk must observe the seven classes of rules with complete confidence. If he has no defects he gets the honour of practising well. Moreover, he becomes truly learned by this means. Besides the seven classes of offences, the rules for monks include the morality of four-fold purification. By observing these four trainings a monk can reach the highest stage of sanctity, the perfect purity called Arahantship. If one diligently practises the rules to reach this noble aim, one is called well-trained.
Practice
Therefore, the commentary clearly shows that a lay person must learn his Vinaya. For monks, there is the code of conduct described in the Vinaya Pitaka. The advice in the Mangala Sutta does not convey the sense that laity should learn the monks Vinaya. The term well-trained does not mean mere academic study. Academic knowledge is useless in this sphere. What well-trained means here is that a monk diligently follows the Vinaya rules in practice. So to be well-trained also means to be learned. The main point is that without following the Vinaya rules devotedly one does not deserve to be called learned. Mere academic knowledge becomes useless if it is not put into practice.
As with Dhamma, Vinaya is essentially a matter of practice and realization. To ensure that our approach will be practical, we must ask questions of its results. We can then observe what fruits our approach bears and make the appropriate adjustments. This is especially important in times of transition when experimentation is necessary. We cant just figure these things out intellectually, they must be tested in real life. Dhamma-Vinaya is always a dialogue between the texts that we cherish and our daily practice of what they teach, as well as between tradition and present reality.
Ven. Narada Maha Thera in his book "The Buddha and His Teachings" says, The Vinaya Pitaka is regarded as the sheet anchor of the Holy Order of Bhikkus. The history of the gradual development of Sasana from its very inception, a brief account of the life and ministry of the Buddha additional, and details of the three Councils are some other relevant contents of the Vinaya Pitaka. Indirectly it reveals useful information about ancient history, Indian customs, ancient arts and sciences.
One who reads the Vinaya Pitaka cannot but be impressed by the democratic constitution of the Sangha, their holding of possessions in common, the exceptionally high moral standard of the Bhikkhus, and the unsurpassed administrative abilities of the Buddha, who anticipated even the present Parliamentary system.
And it may come as a surprise to many westerners to learn that in the Assemblies of the Buddhists in India two thousand years and more ago are to be found the rudiments of our own Parliamentary practice of the present day.

Retired judge heads committee probing EPF investments
The Central Bank has appointed a special high-level independent committee headed by a retired Judge to probe investments of EPF monies and ascertain the truth behind allegations that the Bank had incurred immense losses by these investments. This high-level probe will find out whether there had been any shortcomings on the part of the officials responsible for investing EPF money in a proper and transparent manner, said Central Province Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy at a press conference held at the Central Bank premises.
The Governor said so when journalists pointed out that there were allegations that the bank had incurred losses amounting to Rs 9.5 billion in investments made with EPF funds. Journalists pointed out that an internal audit too had established this loss.
The Governor said the internal audit would help to decide whether there was a truth in these allegations or not.
He said all officers who handled investments of EPF funds have been transferred out to other departments to ensure an impartial probe.
