Laliths verdict encourages well performing officials
The court sentence served on a former Secretary to the President who was a member of the highest echelon of the Public Service will induce all other public servants to perform their duties well in the interest of the people without succumbing to the pressure exerted by politicians in future, Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene said.
He said Lalith Weeratunge was a highly respected public servant and no one will rejoice at the punishment meted out to him.
But, he has to bear it up if he has committed a wrong at the instance of the former rulers. It is illegal to distribute Sil cloth during an election using public funds amounting to Rs.600 million, State Minister Wijewardene added.
Wijewardene said he agrees with Minister John Amaratungas statement that it is regrettable to see a public official being given such a sentence. But everyone should bow their heads to a court decision.
The State Defence Minister made this observation to the media after laying the foundation stone for a Daham Pasala building at Pilikuttuwa Viharaya, Gampaha.
Wijewardene said their endeavour was to guide the country along the correct path. This could be accomplished because the government had weathered all the initial problems encountered during the last two years.
Asked whether it is not a problem to see politicians and high state officials sent to prison transferred immediately to the prison hospital when normal prisoners were denied that privilege, State Minister Wijewardene said he too agreed with this argument.
They hoped to have discussions with the President and the Prime Minister regarding this matter, he said.

My dear old thing Blofeld bows out
LONDON, Sunday  Lord's, the home of cricket, is known for having a conservative crowd, with modest applause the order of the day. So anyone observing the prolonged burst of clapping when England were 88 for one on their way to a target of 107, and a series win against West Indies in the third Test on Saturday, could well have wondered what was going on.
The answer was that, after 45 years with BBC Radio's Test Match Special, itself celebrating its 60th anniversary in 2017, Henry Blofeld had just completed his final commentary stint.
I've enjoyed every moment we've had together, it's been the greatest fun, he said during his closing moments on air.
Thank you for listening -- you all say you're going to miss me, I'm going to miss you all terribly.
Unusually for a man best known for his work in radio, Blofeld has long cut an instantly recognisable figure and Saturday was no exception.
Cerise trousers and a similarly coloured cravat were teamed with a pink shirt and lime green jacket, allied to a pair of two-tone cherry pink and white loafer shoes.
Educated at the exclusive Eton College school, which has produced several British prime ministers, most recently David Cameron, and Cambridge University, Blofeld was an outstanding schoolboy batsman.
But a cycling accident in his final year at Eton, where his father had been a contemporary of Ian Fleming and the inspiration for the name of the villain Blofeld in the author's James Bond spy novels, meant he was never as good a cricketer again.
The on-field loss was offset by off-field again, with Blowers -- whose brother followed a rather more establishment career in becoming a High Court judge -- going on to entertain generations of listeners as much for his descriptions of what was happening around a ground, be it the progress of London buses or passing birds, as the actual cricket itself.
There was widespread dismay when Blofeld, famed for his my dear old thing catchphrase delivered in a voice so aristocratic it might have been aged in a sherry barrel, announced his retirement, with England captain Joe Root summing up the mood of many cricket followers by saying Saturday: He'll be sorely missed. Not that Blofeld himself has any regrets. I am 78 next week -- or is it the week after -- and at my age you don't get better, he told AFP in an interview before play at Lord's on Saturday.
I think it's better for everyone to get rid of the old farts -- they can fart around for too long. When Blofeld started his broadcasting career, a tweet was the sound made by one of his beloved pigeons and he said there had been a noticeable change in cricket commentary down the decades. If I am any good at any thing it's describing things. Commentary has become more conversational, explained Blofeld, whose memorable moments behind the microphone included being on air when England completed an astounding come from behind victory against arch-rivals Australia in the 1981 Headingley Test. I think it's important to go over the boundary and paint the entire picture. Then the public can pay you the greatest compliment of all -- which is that you made me feel I was there'.

Take a minute, change a life
Sri Lanka yesterday marked 'World Suicide Prevention Day', which falls on September 10. Take a minute, change a life was the theme of World Suicide Prevention Day 2017 which encourages individuals as members of communities, learn to hold responsibility for those who are struggling, practise empathy and improve non-judgmental point of view.
This year marks the 15th commemoration of World Suicide Prevention Day.
According to 2016 Sri Lanka police reports 2,339 males and 686 females committed suicide in Sri Lanka that year.
The numbers in 2015 were 2,389 males and 668 females.
The 2016 annual police report on reasons to suicide records 630 deaths due to harassment by the spouse and family disputes, 381 deaths due to chronic diseases and physical disabilities, 244 deaths due to mental disorder, 151 deaths due to economic problems, poverty, indebtedness, 125 deaths due to addiction to narcotic drugs and 1069 due to other reasons. Among those who committed suicide in 2016, 336 individual were over 71 years old and 285 individuals were between ages 51-55. In 2016, 293 persons between ages 21-25 and 242 individuals between ages 46-50 and 239 persons between ages 56-60 have committed suicide.
In the previous year, 1573 have committed suicide by ways of strangling where as 873 by drinking insecticides and pesticides. 136 have committed suicide by jumping on to moving trains or vehicles. According to Dr. D.P. Wijesinghe Sri Lanka came in first in world ranking of highest suicide rate in 1997. There is a slight increase in suicides in years 2015 and 2016, he said.
According to International Association for Suicide Prevention, more than 800,000 people die by suicide and up to 25 times make a suicide attempts, every year around the globe. The reasons, the IASP says, are personal and different.

16 years after 9/11: The state of the terrorist threat

Sixteen years after the 9/11 attacks, there is a fair amount of good news about the state of the battle against jihadist terrorists: The United States has not suffered a successful attack by a foreign terrorist organization since al Qaeda's horrific attack on the World Trade Center and Pentagon.
Al Qaeda's core group, based in Afghanistan and Pakistan, hasn't launched a successful attack in the West since the suicide bombings on London's transportation system more than a decade ago in 2005, whichkilled 52 commuters.
The terrorist group that sprang up in the wake of the setbacks suffered by al Qaeda, ISIS is itself now largely defeated, having lost the city of Mosul, its headquarters in Iraq, and much of the city of Raqqa, its headquarters in Syria.
The US-led coalition has also killed an estimated60,000 to 70,000ISIS fighters, according to US Special Operations Command's Gen. Raymond "Tony" Thomas, speaking at the Aspen Security Forum in July.
A month later Brett McGurk, the US envoy to the anti-ISIS coalition,said ISIS had lost control of more than three-quarters of the territory that it had once held in Iraq and more than half of what it had once controlled in Syria.
The threat posed by American "foreign fighters" returning to the United States who were trained by ISIS or other jihadist groups in Iraq and Syria is quite low compared to European countries. According to public records, only seven American militants have returned from the Syrian and Iraqi battlefields and none has carried out an act of terrorism.
That's the good news, but there are other troubling trends. Since 2014 there have been six lethal jihadist terrorist attacks in the United States, killing 74 people, according to New America's research.
Those attacks were carried out by American citizens and legal permanent residents, not by foreign terrorists as was the case on 9/11.
These American terrorists were inspired by ISIS propaganda online, but had no direct contact with the group.
Jihadist terrorists in the United States today overwhelmingly radicalize online. Of the 129 militants from the United States who joined jihadist terrorist groups in Iraq and Syria, or attempted to do so, or helped others to do so, 101 of them downloaded and shared jihadist propaganda online and some conducted encrypted online discussions with ISIS militants based in the Middle East, according to New America research.
The Israeli counterterrorism expert Gabriel Weimann rightlypoints outthat the "lone wolf" is now part of a virtual pack.
In the cases of the 129 militants drawn to the Syrian conflict, none appears to have been recruited in person by other militant operatives.
The Trump administration's temporary travel ban from six Muslim majority countries does nothing to address this "homegrown" militant threat that is enabled by jihadist propaganda online. Travel bans, of course, have no impact on the Internet.
While the United States has seen no lethal attacks in which the perpetrators were trained and directed by foreign terrorist organizations since 9/11, there have been five ISIS-directed attacks in Europe since 2014 that killed 188 people, around twice the death toll of all deadly jihadist attacks in the United States since 9/11.
Meanwhile, theTaliban in Afghanistan are at their strongest pointsince their defeat by US forces shortly after 9/11.
Other forms of political violence in the United States
Terrorism in the United States doesn't emanate only from jihadists, who havekilled 95 peoplein the States since 9/11.
Individuals motivated by far-right ideology have killed 68 people in the United States during the same period, while individuals motivated by black nationalist ideology have killed eight people, according to New America research.
The drivers of terrorism
Even though ISIS is largely defeated, the conditions that led to the group's emergence largely remain, including the regional civil war in the Middle East between Sunni and Shia that has consumed Iraq, Syria and Yemen; the collapse of Arab governance around the region; the collapse of economies in war-torn Muslim states and the population bulge in the Middle East and North Africa.
This has precipitated a tidal wave of Muslim immigration into Europe. Those immigrants are arriving in countries where Muslims are often marginalized and this wave of Muslim immigration has helped fuel the recent rise of European ultranationalist parties. This is a combustible mix, which may help propel some European Muslims to subscribe to the tenets of militant jihadism.
These drivers of jihadism strongly suggest that a son of ISIS will form in coming years.
Even as ISIS suffers repeated setbacks, al Qaeda's branch in Syria has shown surprising resiliency and it's possible that a rump version of ISIS might merge with al Qaeda in Syria. The two groups split from each other in 2014.
Al Qaeda's core group also seems to be grooming Hamza bin Laden, one of Osama bin Laden's sons, as a next generation leader. Hamza bin Laden, who is in his late twenties, has appeared in a number of al Qaeda media productions in recent years.
The continued resilience of al Qaeda in Syria and the fact that the drivers of global jihadism are not going away anytime soon suggests that the long war that began on 9/11 more than a decade and half ago has many years left before it finally sputters out.

ADB releases  flagship statistical report for Asia  and the Pacific
The Asian Development Bank (ADB) has released the 2017 edition of Key Indicators for Asia and the Pacific.
Key Indicators 2017 provides the latest available economic, financial, social, and environmental statistics for the 48 regional members of ADB.
Key Indicators 2017 will be a useful tool for ADB member countries, researchers, media, and citizens for monitoring the regions development progress, said ADB Chief Economist Yasuyuki Sawada.
Data plays a critical role in helping decision-makers prioritize policies to meet their development goals and the report brings together comparable statistics on a broad range of development themes.
A key addition to this years report is an analysis on sex-disaggregated data that ADB researchers conducted through three pilot surveys. Despite strong evidence linking womens asset ownership to the attainment of development goals, such sex-disaggregated data needed to monitor progress in the 2030 Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are scarce.

Ageing at work
Although most people would not realise it, the structure of Sri Lankan society is changing  more of us are living longer. Life expectancy has been growing steadily for over half a century. In 1960, a Sri Lankan man could expect on average to live to the age of 62. Today, he can expect to live to 72. In 1960, a Sri Lankan woman also could have lived to an average 62 and today she can expect to live up to 78.
Today there are over 2.1 million people aged 65 years or over of which 57.5 % are women. Our current birth rate is 15.5 births/1,000 population while our death rate is 6.2 deaths/1,000 population. These simple statistics reflect the true nature of our demographic scenario.
Sri Lanka is slowly reaching a crisis point. Statistics predict that in 25 years from now, one quarter of our total population would be elderly persons.
Its time policymakers in Sri Lanka sit down and take stock of the increasing elders situation and decide about the course of action to be taken. It needs to be done without any further delay.
Definition of elder
Before we progress further, let us ask ourselves a simple question. What does elder mean Who exactly is a senior Sri Lankan When does someone become an older worker Any research will reveal an almost bewildering variety of definitions. The United Nations uses 60 as the threshold for old age. OECD and various other local and international agencies uses 65 as the threshold for old age across the general population. Many western countries including Australia also use 65 as threshold. Some countries classify workers and job seekers as old at 55. Sri Lanka is one of them.
Of course, wherever the threshold is set for statistical or policy purposes, every individual is different. Each ones so called old age is dependent on his (or her) attitude, level of activity, mental and physical health, life experiences, sex, cultural background, family situation, and so on. Age is also a matter of other peoples perceptions: younger workers (aged under 45) routinely consider colleagues old at 50, whereas most workers aged 45 or over consider colleagues old only at 65.
Threat to productivity
In any country, the rapid ageing of the population and the associated decline in workforce participation are predicted to see the slowing down in gross domestic product (GDP) over the coming decades. In addition, the aged dependency ratio will keep on rising.
Understandably, in such a situation, the Government and the private sector will collectively draw up a policy plan aiming to increase the older workforce participation rate in order to enhance national productivity and reduce the burden on the taxpayer.
For example, when Australia faced the issue of rapidly ageing population, a report bluntly stated that the Governments overarching objective should be to keep people in work, and paying taxes, longer - rather than being in receipt of old age pensions - and to support people into self-funded retirement.
In Sri Lankan context, we all know that our workforce is already ageing. Nevertheless, consistent research findings indicate a paradox in the workplace: that employers, both in public and private sector, recognise the significance of population ageing but either do not expect their work or business to have to do anything in response, or do not take more than temporary - non-strategic action.
The increasing number of older workers seeking to keep working or re-join the workforce represent an opportunity for the government and the corporate sector if they are ready to rise to the challenge: to appreciate the importance of older workers, to manage the changes, and to ensure that their workplaces are positioned to make the most of older workers contributions.
For monetary or non-monetary reasons, active work is an important element of ones well-being, whether the person is aged or not. Recognizing this fact could be an essential part of the solution for ageing problem.
Paid work contributes not only to material well-being but also to psychological well-being through social interactions and opportunities for personal and professional growth. And unpaid work, like volunteering, care work, and artistic work, can provide these same psychological benefits. Given these positive effects, encouraging and rewarding paid and unpaid work among the elderly could be a crucial part of the solution to the aging-related fiscal and social challenge
Phased-in retirement is a workable strategy now adopted in many countries in the western world and would suit Sri Lanka, too. To make it workable, Government and private sector policymakers should consider: (i) a gradual retirement scheme allowing older individuals to lower their working hours yet remain in the workforce until a later age and (ii) furnishing options for and rewarding volunteering, care, and artistic activities among older society members.
Economic and business case
There is an economic benefit for longer working lives. Contrary to popular belief, the evidence shows that keeping more aged people in workplace actually improves the quality of work in the establishment because aged workers are experienced, they care for their workplace and, above all, they can guide the younger team members with their knowledge and experience.
There is also a clear business benefit as the retiring workforce is already starting to cause skill shortages in certain sectors which will only worsen in future years if the most experienced workers retire or leave the country.
However, social norms that dictate the expected age of retirement can be slow to change, but eventually it has to happen keeping up with the developing trend in other countries.
Self-employment
Whilst self-employment is not for everyone, it can provide the flexibility that many older workers want or need. It offers another avenue to utilise the skills they have acquired over a lifetime of employment, gives them financial independence, flexibility in working hours and the opportunity to rise to a new professional challenge. The Government could encourage the aged people to become entrepreneurs by giving them financial and non-financial support.
Key opportunities
This writer can see three key opportunities for the state sector and private sector companies if they retain the older employees.
Increasing productivity: Successful organisations appreciate the business case for engaging retaining and retraining older workers in order to ensure current and future productivity.
Moving beyond stereotypes: Organisations which strive to engage and retain older workers understand the impact of age discrimination as a barrier to older worker participation.
Investing in flexibility: Successful organisations build flexibility into the workplace and facilitate flexible careers suitable for older workers.
If the Government and private sector are keen to seize the opportunity, changes are urgently required to overcome the barriers to later life working.
The concept of retirement and ageing in the workforce must move with the times as peoples lives and the population demographics change.
To take full advantage of the opportunity, employers (both state and private) need to consider the training and professional development needs and interests of older workers.
This will include tailoring the type of training offered to ensure it is appropriate for older workers, as well as identifying roles in which older workers can assist with in-house training and knowledge transfer.
In cases where individuals are unable to take advantage of phased-in retirement - due to health issues, family obligations, or skills mismatch - Government could promote and reward volunteering, care work, and artistic work among the elderly. Such unpaid activities improve the quality of the social fabric, help the well-being of those engaging in them, contribute to the economy, and reduce healthcare and welfare costs.
Providing opportunities for the elderly to remain in the workforce longer as well as engage in volunteering, care, and artistic activities can provide both social and economic benefits and relieve some of the fiscal pressures related to aging societies.
However, at the same time, policies should be arranged in a way that recognizes the dignity and autonomy of older individuals as opposed to providing them with meaningless or degrading tasks merely to keep them occupied.
In addition to furnishing meaningful and rewarding opportunities, activities should be adapted to the physical and mental aptness of older individuals.

I will provide solutions to the peoples problems and requirements in a fair manner, the President stated. He said the people of Polonnaruwa voted for him without any division of the political parties or colours. The President added every citizen would be provided equal opportunities and they will enjoy the fruits of development, without any political bias.

Anderson savours 500-wicket milestone as England seal series
LONDON, Saturday - James Anderson has known many great days in his career but he said Saturday's nine-wicket defeat of West Indies would live him with for a long time after taking 500 Test wickets.
Having become the first England bowler, and just the sixth in history, to reach the landmark figure on Friday, the 35-year-old Anderson carried on to post new Test-best figures of seven for 42 on Saturday as West Indies were dismissed for 177 in their second innings.
That left England with a target of just 107 for a 2-1 series victory and they duly knocked off the runs in 28 overs to win with more than two days to spare.
Playing a Test match here at Lord's is always special, but this week will live with me for a long time, Anderson told Sky Sports.
My family have been here, my friends have been here, and to share the moment with guys I've played over 100 Tests with as well is extra special, the Lancashire paceman added.
Anderson, who made his Test debut at Lord's back in 2003, needed just four balls Saturday to take his third wicket of the innings after a double strike on Friday. He then claimed two in three balls after lunch, including the key wicket of Shai Hope for 62 as West Indies man-of-the-series was caught behind off an excellent leg-cutter.
That double success started a collapse that saw West Indies lose their last four wickets for just 22 runs.
Jimmy's performance speaks for itself, said England captain Joe Root. To be able to hold a length and put guys under pressure is a great skill.
He's a massive part of our dressing room and I'm sure he will be for a long time to come.
Once Anderson had bowled Kemar Roach to wrap up West Indies second innings, it was just a question of what margin England would win by and how quickly they would do it.
Cook's exit, lbw for 17 to leg-spinner Devendra Bishoo's first ball of the innings, denied England a 10-wicket success.
But under pressure top-order batsmen Mark Stoneman (40 not out) and Tom Westley (44 not out) saw England to their meagre target without further loss. Victory meant Root has won both his first two Test series as England captain after a 3-1 success against South Africa earlier in the season. I'm very pleased, Yorkshire batsman Root told BBC Radio's Test Match Special after what was England's last match at this level match before they begin their Ashes defence against Australia in Brisbane in November. In the second innings Jimmy was outstanding.
The ball looked out of shape, I don't know how he managed to get seven wickets with it.
For West Indies, the huge consolation of the series was the way they bounced back from an innings defeat in the opener at Edgbaston to draw level days later with a five-wicket win in the second Test at Headingley. That was just their fourth away victory, excluding matches against Bangladesh and Zimbabwe, in 88 Tests.
It was built on two hundreds from Hope, his first in Test cricket, and the 23-year-old Barbados batsman appeared to have come of age during this series.
In the second innings we didn't bat as well as we would have liked, said West Indies captain Jason Holder.
But Shai Hope batted extremely well and we have a lot of positives to take, added the all-rounder.
Credit must go to James Anderson. He is a world-class bowler and I'd like to congratulate him on 500 wickets, but I want to urge our guys to keep going.

Harold Herat
A genial politician
Above any flaw, a much celebrated politician of our time, clean both in body and mind, Harold Herat was held in high esteem not only nationally, but internationally as well. He was a total politician with an ability to speak virtually on any subject matter that amazed everyone who came in contact with him.
His style of delivery and wisdom sat well on any medium, be it politics, English, religion, law, culture and even philosophy. Literature was his favourite subject and I as his wife shared many happy hours talking it over. He was a coloursman in tennis and represented his college, Joseph Vaz, at school and at national level. He brought much credit to his club, Marawila Sports Club, which he represented at Masters annually until his last year before death claimed his beautiful clean life.
He was a handsome man who carried his magnetic personality with ease, striking an impact on anyone. He came from a line of politicians such as Sir Claude Corea, Shirley Corea and even the late President J.R. Jayawardena. During hectic sessions in Parliament, he found time to go to church with us at St. Stephen's Church, Marawila, unless he was out of the country. A devout Christian who trusted in God, he led us on a path of spiritual belief which made our lives happy.
Born into an affluent planting family in the North-Western sea belt of the country, Harold chose law for his career though his father was a foreign-qualified physician. While practicing law at Marawila Courts, Harold was attracted to politics. He was picked for Nattandiya electorate in the 1977 General Election by J.R. Jayawardena against many other formidable aspirants.
It is perhaps this soft corner that JR had for Harold that made him to appoint him a Minister within one year of election as a Member of Parliament. He was the first non-Cabinet Minister to be appointed under the Second Republican Constitution of 1978. He was assigned the subject he had the greatest potential to perform, the coconut industry. Having inherited vast and excellent acres of coconut lands in the Marawila/Mudukatuwa area, though later diminished with the land reforms of the previous regime, he was expected to revitalize this important segment of our economy which was essentially indigenous in nature. He proved to be a worthy successor to that great politician though of a different genre, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva, who as Minister of plantations in the Sirimavo Bandaranaike Government and had laid the institutional foundation to uplift the coconut industry.
Harold not only improved and rationalized this network, but also introduced new impetus through additional local investment and much needed foreign investment and innovation. The coconut statistics for the era (1978-89) not only in plantation, but also processing and marketing would amply demonstrate the contribution that Harold Herat made as Minister of Coconut Industries.
Fluent in both Sinhala and English, he could speak to a local crowd using their own idiom and to a forum abroad in polished dictum. I have watched him in both. With local audiences he may use pithy language. It is really as a gentleman that he impressed anyone who came in contact with him. Neat in appearance, but appropriately dressed always, he was an embodiment of decency. As a rule, he was courteous to his staff, deferential to those with expertise in relevant fields and considerate to all. Scrupulously honest, he had a high sense of decorum and correctitude.
It is ten years since the demise of our husband/father, planter, lawyer, politician, minister, though he may have been, we shall always remember him as a gentleman of the first order.
May the turf on his grave remain greener everyday.

Tuan Hadjie Jaldin
A compassionateindividual
Born in the healthy climes of Hatton on December 12, 1943, my grandfather was named as Tuan Hadjie Jaldin by my great grandparents Zainul Abdeen Jaldin and Gnei Seenar Jaldin. He married my grandmother Zareena Meedin in 1967 and they were blessed with five children. I wish to write a few words in memory of my beloved grandfather on his sixth death anniversary which fell on September 2.
My grandfather obtained his primary education at Royal College, Colombo and then entered Greenlands College (Isipathana), where he was a standout performer in sports and was the first rugby captain of the school. Thereafter, he played for CR and FC for many years and subsequently was its rugby manager for several years. Whilst working at CR and FC, he was in the company of many Sri Lankan and European players.
He used to relate many stories about the games during that era. Especially about the rivalry between CR and Havies. Being a reputed athlete in school, my grandfathers pet event was the 400 metres and he took part in the Asian Veterans' Games held in Singapore in 1986, finishing fourth.
He was a very caring husband, father, grandfather, brother and friend. He was such a caring person and loved us; his grandchildren; more than anything. Whenever a visitor came to our place, he used to relate our mischievous deeds with them. We used to address him as Kakey and he was always there to support us showing his love at all times. His grandchildren (numbering 15), some of whom he was not fortunate enough to see for they were born after his demise, do resemble him and have qualities similar to him.
We are indeed fortunate to have him in our lives since he shared all his stories and memories of his career. We will not meet any other person like him and we all miss him so much.
May almighty Allah grant him Jennathul Firdouse.

He was a caring grandfather
As a tribute to my late father Terence Ashley Peiris, I am writing this appreciation on the 60th death anniversary of my grandfather, which falls on the September 15.
It is sad as I only faintly remember him, as I was only three years old when he left this world to be with our Lord Almighty. My brother Trilanth was born 11 months after his death and my grandmothers wish had been to give him my grandfathers initials; T. M. Peiris. In keeping with her ardent request, he was named Trilanth Malkantha.
He was seeya-daddy to myself and my brother. He was also referred to by that same endearing term by my Peiris cousins; Ninesh, Nilendirini, Sharika and Dilhani. Daddy was the term used for him by my Aunts children.
I still remember one special occasion where he brought me a toy; a doll on a bicycle; which he specifically showed me how to operate whilst keeping me on his lap. I could still remember the white full suit he was wearing on that day. This is the only memory I have of my dear seeya-daddy.
I also recall my thaththa telling me all of seeya-daddys good qualities and the love and devotion he had for the family. He had a good voice and used to play the violin while singing. Sometimes my grandmother would also join him and the two would sing hymns together.
Even my amma used to tell me that seeya-daddy treated her as one of his own daughters and he had been very close to my maternal grandparents too.
My two uncles (loku bappa Tilney and podi bappa Dudley) were very young when seeya-daddy passed away and they must have missed him badly at that time. Nevertheless, they followed seeya-daddys footsteps and served God to the best of their ability and they were both local preachers in the Methodist Church.
More than anything else, I am thankful to seeya-daddy for giving my malli and I a loving and caring father who loved us so much and did everything for us.
Dearest seeya-daddy, we rejoice as we are certain that you are with the Lord Almighty. You will remain in our hearts forever. May your soul rest in peace until we meet again on that beautiful shore.

Farewell to a cherished friend
Harold was my closest friend and he was also the best friend I ever had in my life. Ten years ago this time, I spent each day by his side at the hospital as he lay in hope that he would recover. However, God needed Harold near him and he was taken away from his dear wife and three lovely children.
With his passing, I lost a dear friend who helped me in numerous ways, especially when times were tough and things were hard for me and my family. We loved each other from the beginning and no one can ever take his place as my dearest friend.
Those who shared his life will always remember the many precious moments and special memories that revolved around him. He will not be forgotten and we were truly blessed to have him in our lives. May the Lord grant him eternal rest. Deanna Jayasuriya
Romsan Deegayu Dissanayakea
He was a beacon of light
Pahala Lelwala, Dandunna nestles in the backdrop of the Kirindalahena mountain range on one side and the greenish paddy fields that spread along the Wanduramba-Baddegama highway like a green carpet on the other, naturally sandwiched to sooth the village folk in the Galle District. The cool breeze that takes its natural path, sweeping the paddy fields, the thickets and the rustling bamboo leaves are poetry in motion in this bucolic hamlet. Tranquility and the religious fervour of the locality provide the much-needed springboard for anyone to unlock his or her potentials and rhythmically strive to be a genius and serve ones fellowmen.
Romsan Deegayu Dissanayake, born on September 26, 1915, was naturally blessed with all of natures blessings to make his journey in life to be evergreen in the hearts of the villagers forever. It is veritably true and my concern in this piece of writing is to rekindle my nostalgic memories of him, as I felt, when I was an inexperienced youth in the formative years of my childhood. For me, he was a colossus guru and for the village in the vicinity; a beacon light.
The late Benjamin Dissanayake and Karaline Weeragunarathne Sahabandu from the adjacent hamlet Urala would have never thought that their youngest son could make a long walk to success in his life. He has had one brother and two sisters who had predeceased him at their ripe age. He had his primary education at the village school, Lelwala Wickramasinghe Primary School. This promising village prodigy became a teacher in his own alma mater at the age of 19. He thought to himself that it was his bounden duty to work hard to uplift of his native village. Mangala Youth Society was his stepping stone in this regard. At the outset of the society, he had only 12 members; yet with the passage of time, it became the umbrella organization that enveloped almost all the social services activities of the hamlet.
I fail in my duty if I dont mention here that he donated a huge portion of his own land to erect a permanent building for the society. This historical record is of paramount importance to us because in the modern society people are in a mad rat race to grab more and more lands for selfish aims. His farsightedness in planning for rural development is quite visible in the programmes he drafted for further expansion. He had a special education programme to improve literacy among the adults. It was a step taken in the nick of time. The village library programme in the locality was his brainchild. Listening to the radio, followed by reading was very instrumental to keep the people abreast of time. Listening to dhamma discourse on the wireless on Sunday was made virtually compulsory to the villagers and thus he was able to tame the rustic villager to a great extent. He firmly believed that the development of the village depended mainly on agriculture.
He took the initiative and introduced modern agricultural methods to village farming. Their annual programmes ended with a village sports gala that gave the opportunity to people from all walks of life to enjoy to their hearts content. 'Sangabo' mutual benefits society was another welfare organization greatly benefited by his benevolence. Dissanayake was the unanimous choice for their chairmanship. In recognition of his yeoman service to the village, they held its fourth anniversary in a grand manner. His contemporary ex-MP for Baddegama, one-time the deputy minister of finance late Neil De Alwis; was one of his close associates, but he never sought any personal favour from him. He exploited his faith on him to have one of his life desires fulfilled. Irrigation of the lowlands in the village was a long felt need. Thus, he was very instrumental in building a dam across two hillocks at Kirindalahena and making a large reservoir for the benefit of the farming community; Kirindalahena Wewa. Its cool water is a soothing balm to the weary farmer and numerous birds.
The rippling waters in this picturesque tank tell us the legend of the hydraulic saga that ignited rural development in the area. It is synonymous with the two great names Neil De Alwis and Romsan Deegayu Dissanayake. Inland fishing became very popular with the humble villagers and nutrition of the rising generation took a new turn. The no mans land in the middle of the tank became a birds paradise, giving birth to a new ecosystem that is a real treat to the eye of the beholder. Dissanayake deserves our credit for leaving a living legacy for us.
After gaining his initial teaching experience at G. Wickramasinghe Primary School in Wanduramba, he entered the then famous Kalurata Katukurunda Teachers College for his professional training in 1951. He cut his teeth as a well-trained teacher there and passed out with flying colours to serve the nation. He specialized in teaching music and art.
He assumed duties as an assistant teacher at Badulla Kadndubudulanda mixed school in 1953. The following schools and the people in the vicinity still appreciate his untiring efforts to develop their schools. His teaching career was unblemished to the letter; a legacy to be emulated.
Matara Maha Vidyalaya was greatly benefited by his expertise. The old generation of Padiyatalawa Maha vidyalaya still remembers his contribution to education.
In 2013, the Government named the primary section of the said school as Deegayu Dissanayake Primary School. This memorial building still remains as a living legend in recognition of his yeoman service for the uplift of the school.
Galidde Govt. school, Nugalanda Maha Vidyalaya, Mayadunna Vidyalaya, all in Ampara; Welideniya Primary School and Vidyananda Vidyalaya in his own area in Indurupathwila and Mahalapitiya Primary school very near to his home, were immensely benefited from his service to the nation. A special mention deserves to be made with regard to Padiyatalawa Maha Vidyalaya because of the very fact that it had been almost irreparably raged by communal disturbances originated from language policy in 1958 and Dissanayake left no stone unturned to develop it to a very great extent. He lit Aladin's magic lamp to do it within a very short time. Community participation in school development gained a new dimension with his untiring efforts.
His dignified service in the capacity of the principal of that school from 1955 to1965 is written in golden letters in the cherished history of the school.
His youth ended in marriage on November 7, 1956. He tied nuptial knots with L.T.G.S. Dissanayake from Bamunugama in Matara, with the blessings of both sides of parents according to the age-old customs and their life story deserves to be bio-graphed for the next generation to read and emulate. They epitomized exemplary living. His widowed wife is a successful nonagenarian now, in the evening of her life.
Her graceful ageing illuminates the locality. She is a highly respected teacher retiree not in uncertain terms. Her forte is also teaching cum social service and the people in the vicinity wish her long life. She is a paragon of virtue.
Madura Mohan, who works in the capacity of works director of The Colombo Municipality, is their eldest son and Paduma Ranjan, his second son, works for Kelani Cables in the capacity of an engineer. They have two daughters; Nayana and Perna; both are veteran teachers of English. Their grandchildren are Amoda Milani, Praveena Nimani, Kehan Nandaja, Eroshan, Lakeesha Sammani, Tharushi Nadheesha and Dhanuja Rukmal. Chathuri Ramyakumari Kumarasiri, Pridharshani Rajapathirana and Sameerathna Hanthi, Lalitha Dahanayake Yapa have been fortunate enough to be daughters-in-law and sons-in-law, respectively, of this great family.
He ceased to be on April 2, 1993. His beloved wife and all his children and in laws were at his deathbed with sorrowful eyes, yet absorbing his inspiration to take the baton to serve mother Lanka with the same spirit. The unending mourners that made a bee line to their simple abode spoke volumes for the greatness of his soul.
Honour and fame, from no condition rise,Act your part well, where all the honour lies.
- William Shakespeare.

Beware the tap water
More than 80 per cent of the world's tap water is contaminated with plastic, new research reveals. The US has the highest contamination rate at 93 per cent, followed by Lebanon and India. France, Germany and the UK have the lowest levels, however, they still come in at 72 per cent. Overall, 83 per cent of water samples from dozens of nations around the world contain microplastics.
Scientists warn microplastics are so small they could penetrate organs.
How was the research carried out
The research was carried out by scientists from the University of Minnesota for an investigation by Orb Media. Results were published by The Guardian.
The scientists tested 159 samples from across the world, including regions such as Uganda, Ecuador and Indonesia.
Microplastics are plastic particles measuring less than 5mm.
What are the health risks
Dr Anne Marie Mahon from the Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology, who led a previous study confirming microplastic contamination in tap water in Ireland, said: 'We don't know what the [health] impact is and for that reason we should follow the precautionary principle and put enough effort into it now, immediately, so we can find out what the real risks are.'
She added that if the microplastic particles are small enough, they can penetrate cells and even organs.
Previous research has also revealed microplastics absorb toxic chemicals, which are then released in the gut of animals. Humans could even breathe in microplastics circulating in the air.
Frank Kelly, professor of environmental health at King's College London, said: 'If we breathe them in they could potentially deliver chemicals to the lower parts of our lungs and maybe even across into our circulation.'
How did water get contaminated
Although unclear, microplastics may enter water systems through the simple everyday wear and tear of clothing and carpets. Tumble dryers may also be a source, particularly if they have a vent to the open air. A previous study also revealed 700,000 plastic fibres could be released into the atmosphere with every washing machine cycle.
What can be done
Current water systems are unable to effectively filter out all microplastic contamination due to the varying size of particles. Bottled water may also not be a safer alternative, as the scientists from the University of Minnesota found a few contaminated samples in their investigation.
Roland Geyer, associate professor of industrial ecology at the University of California in Santa Barbara, said: 'We are increasingly smothering ecosystems in plastic and I am very worried that there may be all kinds of unintended, adverse consequences that we will only find out about once it is too late.' Dr Mahon added more research is required to determine the health implications of microplastic-contaminated water, but in the meantime, people should be conscious of how they dispose of their plastic products. - dailymail.co.uk

Bharti Airtel among Forbes Most Innovative  Companies in the World 2017
Globally acclaimed Forbes magazine has named Bharti Airtel amongst the Worlds 100 Most Innovative Companies 2017.
Forbes magazine which commemorates 100 years of global service, compiles its annual lists across a wide spectrum of industries and sectors based on the performance of individuals and corporate firms, in addition to benchmarking sports, places as well as education aspects.
According to Forbes, industries that are known to invest in innovation are included in the list. Companies are ranked according to their innovation premium - the difference between their market capitalization and the net present value of cash flows from existing businesses. "The difference between them is the bonus given by equity investors on the educated hunch that the company will continue to come up with profitable new growth," the magazine said.
Bharti Airtel Lanka, a member of the third largest telecommunication network provider with a global footprint in 17 countries, commenced commercial operations of services in Sri Lanka in 2009 and was the fastest operator to reach 1 million customers, providing digital mobile services that include voice, data and enterprise solutions.

Bicentenary celebration of the birth of Bahaullah
Founded 150 years ago, the Bahai Faith is the youngest of the worlds independent religions. The vision of Bahai Faith is a world where all races, creeds, and colors have blended into a single universal society. In just over 100 years, the Bahai Faith embraced people from more than 2,100 ethnic, racial and tribal groups.
The Bahais believe that the most important of these needs in this era is the realization of the oneness of humanity.
Bahais do not follow rituals, rites or sermons-but have temples known as the Bahai house of worship in every continent. The Bahai house of worship is sometimes referred to by the name of mariqu-l-an Arabic phrase meaning dawning-place of the remembrances of God.
These houses of worship have become magnets for those from every faith and people with no faith, as a place to reflect, meditate and pray.
The Bahais believe that every time a manifestation of God appears, a fuller measure of inspiration for the next stage awakening and progress of humanity is released into the world.
Human beings are said to be messengers of God. In the past, the sun of truth has shone through Noah, Abraham, Krishna, Moses, Zoroaster, Buddha, Jesus Christ and Muhammed. Bahais believe that all the prophets of the past are in equal rank in purpose.
They are all divine gardeners helping the growth of the blessed tree of God.
The Bahai doctrine states that both Bahaullah and The Bab are considered to be manifestations of God, where the bab (gate) mission, which was to last only six years, was to prepare the way for the coming of a manifestation of God who would usher in the age of peace and justice promised in all the worlds religions: Bahullh.Bahais believe that Bahaullah has appeared for the current cycle of humanity and has provided the basis for the establishment of a new spiritual and temporal order.
Therefore, they believe that Bahaullah is the promised one.
In Sri-Lanka, the Bahai Faith emerged in 1949 as an independent world religion. Since that time, growing numbers throughout the country, representing various, ethnic, racial, religious backgrounds and cultures have been finding inspiration and guidance in the teachings of the Bahai Faith.
Members of the Bahai community are working together with their neighbors and friends to promote and contribute to the well-being and progress of society.
On the October 21 and 22 this year, the Bahai solar calendar places the bicentennial anniversaries of the birth of Bahaullah and the birth of the bab.
Over five million Bahais in nearly 100,000 localities worldwide are preparing for major upcoming celebrations.
The global festivities involving people of thousands of ethnic backgrounds is demonstrative of a key message of Bahaullahs life and teachings: that a special time has arrived for the entire human race as it gradually moves from a stage of collective adolescence to one of maturity and wholeness.
In addition, the Bahais worldwide are looking forward to stunning new houses of worships being built.
These temples are being built in Chile, Cambodia, Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, Kenya, India (in Bihar Sharif, in addition to the one already in New Delhi), Papua New Guinea, and Vanuatu.
Embracing ideals that combine service and worship, Bahais are engaged in a worldwide effort at community-building that, with no sectarian or congregational aspiration, aims to contribute to a pattern of collective life on earth that is informed by the uplifting teachings of Bahaullah and the babteachings that reinforce and amplify the teachings of all the worlds great religions.
The Bahais are traditionally open to people from all communities and systems of beliefs. As such, the upcoming celebrations too are going to be open for all people who wish to participate.

In black and white
He simply does not read books - he inhales them. Once he sits down with a volume, it is going to take a pretty earthshaking event to distract him. Nothing sounds better than having a whole day to indulge in the simple pleasure of reading, continuously and obsessively. This just about sums up the enthusiasm that renowned publisher Vijitha Yapa has towards reading, a passion which he turned into the largest English bookstore chain in Sri Lanka. Lalana Yapa shares some reminiscences of the former journalist and editor and what it was like to spearhead a process which brought globally renowned works of art to the Sri Lankan readers fingertips.
The reading habit
Vijitha was born and bred in Waralla, a village between Akuressa and Deniyaya in the Southern Province. His father, Henry Yapa, was a planter and he was the one who had initiated the village temple and the school. There were 10 children in Vijithas family and he was the seventh child. He went to the village school first before going to S. Thomas College, Bandarawela, and later S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. Vijithas father was into reading so the children developed this habit from him.
Vijitha has been an ardent reader ever since his childhood. They say he used to come to the dining table with a book. His father has often called him Pandithaya because of this habit.
Even now Vijitha reads from morning till nightfall. He pretty much reads any book that he picks up. I love detective novels. I am mostly into Patricia Cornwells books. Whenever Vijitha comes across a section which really interests him, he shares it with me. Our sons, Daminda and Peshan, too are prolific readers. They have seen us reading books from childhood and have become bookworms. I think we read more than we talk to one another!
The meeting
Vijitha is my cousin. His mother, Catherine, and my mother, Sumana, were sisters. I was no book enthusiast then because I was more interested in sports. I worked as an English stenographer at the Attorney Generals Department and Vijitha was working as a journalist, writing for foreign newspapers in 1975. We were in contact mostly due to our work.
The marriage
Vijitha was mostly at the estate. We met only when he visited Colombo. My mother was against our relationship.
Therefore we only held a registration and clicked a few pictures. We got married on March 27, 1977. We have been courting each other for about one year before marriage. We went to the Philippines soon after marriage because Vijitha had to undergo training in television for one year.
Parenthood
Vijitha and I have two sons. Daminda who is 39 now was born in 1978. Peshan was born the following year. Though there was no way to find out the gender of your child those days I personally wanted a son to carry on the family name. When I was expecting our second child Vijitha said that he wished for a daughter but I was determined to have a son again so that the elder one will have a playmate.
In my opinion Vijitha was too lenient on the boys. Even if I try to correct them in certain matters, he tried to prevent the punishment. I was the strict parent. Daminda is employed in Oman. Peshan is a director at the Vijitha Yapa Group of Companies.
Birth of Vijitha Yapa Group of Companies
Vijitha was employed at the Board of Investment (BOI). It was called the Greater Colombo Economic Commission (GCEC) those days. He was working under Upali Wijewardena and was in charge of promotions. Due to the nature of his job he got to know many journalists who flew down to Sri Lanka. One of them suggested that we import a foreign magazine, The Wall Street Journal to Sri Lanka. Vijitha refused the offer saying that he is working for the Government. Then that journalist has suggested that he can at least get the journals imported by me.
Our business started in 1981 and since then it has been very successful. Later we got down the Herald Tribune, Far Eastern Economic Review, the weekly magazine Travel Trade Gazette Asia and others. I was handling everything with a few staff members under Vijithas name.
Other passions
Vijitha loves to travel. It is a passion that we both share. We have travelled extensively even in Sri Lanka. Whenever we see any place of interest in the newspapers, we would visit the place. We go for anything and everything that captures our interest. We went to Hambantota a month ago. We ventured on to Mirissa to engage in whale watching from there. We also paid a visit to Bundala National Park. We visited our eldest son and his wife, Radika, in Oman and then flew to the UK to attend the Book Fair this year. We also went to Chennai and stayed at a beach resort. We attend the London Book Fair in UK and the International Book Fair in India annually.
I really like our visit to Cambodia which was about three years ago. I loved the climate, environment and friendly people in that country. Our favourite holiday destination in Sri Lanka is Trincomalee.
Foodwise
Vijitha and I are into village type of food. He enjoys jakfruit, breadfruit and manioc. Vijitha prefers to have fish most of the time while my youngest son wants meat. I am a vegetarian. Vijithas favourite kind of food is probably green leaves like gotukola. He also likes hoppers.
Dissimilarities
I like watching television. Vijitha is not into watching TV much. I watch three of four different types of news bulletins on different channels. He basically watches the BBC News with me. Apart from that the only other TV programs that we both watch are the teledramas Sidu and Adhiraja Dharmashoka.
Habits
At times Vijitha and I take a walk early mornings from our home in Kirulopane through Jawatta Road to Independence Square and back. We do it about once a week to keep healthy.
Unfulfilled dreams
I believe that Vijistha wants to write down his memoirs. During the 1980s he authored a couple of travel books in Singapore. One was on Maldives and the other was about Sri Lanka. He also wrote a book called Insight Pocket Guide Sri Lanka.

Box Office: Stephen Kings It Smashes Records With Massive $117 Million Opening

It came; It saw; It conquered.
The New Line and Warner Bros. adaptation ofStephen Kings novel is officially shattering box office records during its opening weekend. The R-rated horror film should make a whopping $117.2 million from 4,103 locations, far surpassing earlier expectations. That would give It the third-largest opening weekend of 2017, about even with Spider-Man: Homecoming, which made $117 million. Only Beauty and the Beast and Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 earned more this year. And $7.2 million of Its domestic grosses are coming from 377 Imax screens.
Theres something really special about the story itself, the way the movie was made, and the marketing, said Jeff Goldstein, distribution chief at Warner Bros. The stars aligned on this, and we still have some room to grow for the weekend.
It earned a fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes of 87% and a B+ CinemaScore. Its gender breakdown is reportedly 51% female and 49% male. About two thirds of the audience has been over 25 years old.
Its opening is mostly unprecedented, crushing the record for largest September debut set by Hotel Transylvania 2 in 2015 with $48.5 million, and the biggest opening weekend banked by a horror or supernatural film  Paranormal Activity 3 earned $52.6 million in 2011. When it comes to R-rated movie launches, It falls only to Deadpool, which changed the game in 2016 with a massive $132.4 million opening.This, during a weekend whenHurricane Irma threatens huge portions of Florida and Georgia, which could dent attendance by as much as 5%.
In addition to its domestic grosses, the horror hit is expected to pull in $62 million from 46 markets overseas, giving It a $179 million global debut. Thats a huge win for a movie with an estimated $35 million production budget.
Horror films often have lower budgets than other more CGI-dense blockbusters, so the return on investment has potential to be massive. Goldstein said the genre is one that New Line particularly excels in, and there is potential to see more horror in the future if the right story comes along. If we were able to find more films in this genre, wed be thrilled to make them, he said.
The movie comes courtesy of Argentine director Andy Muschietti, who is known for the 2013 horror film Mama. Bill Skarsgard stars as Pennywise the Clown, who terrorizes young children in Derry, Maine. The rest of the cast includes youngsters Jeremy Ray Taylor, Sophia Lillis, Finn Wolfhard, Wyatt Oleff, Chosen Jacobs, Jack Dylan Grazer, Nicholas Hamilton, and Jackson Robert Scott in supporting roles.
That leaves Open Roads Home Again trailing far behind. The Reese Witherspoon-led romantic comedy should earn $9 million this weekend from 2,940 locations. The $15 million project was directed by Hallie Meyer-Shyer, the daughter of Nancy Meyers, who also worked on the film as a producer. The story centers on Witherspoons character  a mother of two who unexpectedly has three young men come to live with her following arecent separation from her husband.
Lionsgates Hitmans Bodyguard is landing in third with $4.9 million from 3,322 locations after winning the domestic box office for the past three weekends. Annabelle: Creation from Warner Bros. is next with $4 million from 3,003 spots. And Wind River caps the top five with an anticipated $3.2 million from 2,890 theaters.
For the movie business, It couldnt have come at a better time. Following adismal summer box officethat plunged 14.6% from last summer to $3.8 billion, It serves in part as the pick-me-up the industry was desperately craving. After this weekend, the year to date box office will improve from 6.5% behind 2016 to 5.5%, according to data provided by comScore.
Paul Dergarabedian, senior media analyst at comScore, attributed the films success to the universality of the fear of clowns which created an event for fans who came out to be scared en masse in the communal environment of the movie theater.
He added, The marketing campaign brilliantly evoked a sense of teenage wonderment, fear, and ultimately bravery in the face of the true evil as perfectly embodied by Bill Skarsgard as Pennywise. That, along with the great ensemble cast of young actors and a movie that delivered on the promise of that marketing, made the film an astonishing over-performer.
Asequel is already in the works at New Linewith Gary Dauberman attached to write the script, and Muschietti expected to return to the directors chair.

Regarding plans for the next movie, Goldstein said, It puts more pressure on us to come up with the best version of the story so we bring fans what they want to see. Weve had a lot of history with franchises. Some are great, and some we wish we had a little bit more story. Fortunately, theres a lot here in this story.

CEB TUA braces for island-wide strike on September 13
The Ceylon Electricity Board Trade Union Alliance Secretary Ranjan Jayalal yesterday said they would launch an island-wide strike on September 13 from 12 noon against the proposal to increase the electricity tariff and corruption. Accordingly, all employees attached to CEB apart from its administration will cease work supporting the trade union action, he said.
A proposal was forwarded to the Power and Renewable Energy Ministry by the CEB Engineers Association to increase the electricity tariff to meet the financial crisis of the CEB. According to the Engineers Association, the CEB needs an additional income of Rs. 25 billion to meet the financial crisis the CEB is undergoing.
CEB TUA Secretary Ranjan Jayalal speaking to the Daily News said they were of the view that large corruptions within the CEB should be addressed instead of making the public bear the burden of paying for the losses incurred due to corruptions. According to Jayalal, the CEB records fraud amounting to more than Rs. 6 billion not probed into by the CEB administration. Jayalal said two rounds of discussion were held with the Minister and the Deputy Minister of Power and Renewable Energy on last Friday and Saturday to discuss the lack of probe into large scale fraud taking place in the CEB among other matters.

Chaps or Blokes Fries or Chips
Trust Sir George Bernard Shaw to hit the nail right on the head when he said, England and America are two countries separated by the same language. My first personal experience of this was when I spent two weeks in London, and one year in New York. The time I spent in each city made me realize that perhaps a lifetime of reading and studying British literature and watching American movies and TV programs were not adequate preparation for appreciating and coping with the differences between American and British English, both of which until then, I was quite sure I knew pretty well.
The first morning I spent in London I went down to breakfast and the British friend I was staying with welcomed me with a cheerful, Are you all right My immediate reaction was surprise, tinged with worry! Was something wrong with me Did nasty red spots breakout on my skin between the time I left my room to the time I reached the parlor (or should that be parlour) Im OK... I stammered. Then blurted out, Why Do I look like Im sick No, she assured me, I was just asking if you are doing well this morning - no reason. I pressed her to explain further, and finally realized that her, Are you all right is the same as saying, How are you, which is the kind of greeting I am used to, and which it appears belongs to American English.
Later that day we drove all the way to Devon, slowing down several times for the sleeping policeman in the middle of the road! Dont worry, hes meant to be driven over, my friend assured me(these are speed bumps in the USA and for us in Sri Lanka too). While in Devon, I noticed people threw empty packets of chips (what Americans call fries) into the rubbish bin (trash can in America).
My friends cousin, when we met him, told us that he was looking for a new job because he had become redundant. In American English, that means he was laid off because there were too many people doing his job. Other phrases I heard in the UK included queuing which in New York is lining up and looking for the Way Out which in America is Exit.
Origins
According to the Legends of America website, inhabitants of the New World first noticed that their English was different from what was spoken in Britain about one hundred years after settling in Jamestown. Little wonder, for colonists didnt have the ease of communication and transportation available today. They couldnt hop on a plane to visit relatives, nor could they video chat with their grandparents back home. The settlers were interacting with Native Americans as well as with immigrants from Germany, France, and other countries. The Americans coined original words to describe their new environment. For example, what would they call that furry little creature that was always trying to dig holes in the garden They had never seen groundhogs in Great Britain. Meanwhile, words came and went out of fashion in Britain, and the Americans were none the wiser.
Along with groundhogs and woodchucks, other living things earned uniquely American monikers. One of them was the ladybug, the red and black ladybird beetle of the United Kingdom. The Americans based rappel, the act of descending from a height using a rope, on the French word for recall. Uniquely American foods, such as smores, dont have British equivalents because they are still relatively unknown. Perhaps that would change if they sampled them; smores are delicious!
Put on your anorak. Check the pillar box, and see if my business partner sent over the hire purchase. Would the average American understand these commands Probably not! Heres the translation: Put on your jacket. Check the mailbox, and see if my business partner sent over the installment plan.
As Shundalyn Allen explains in her article, How British English and American English are Different there are also words that exist in both languages, but with different meanings. For example, if you requested a caretaker in England, you might be introduced to someone holding a broom and dustpan. There, a caretaker is a person who cleans and maintains a building. To Americans, a caretaker is a person who takes care of someone, such as a child or sick person, or who looks after a property while the owner is away.
Spelling and sentence construction
When it comes to sentence construction British English tends to favor the passive voice (eg. Bill was kicked by Bob.) American prefers the active voice (eg. Bob kicked Bill.) British English uses more auxiliary verbs (to be, to have, to do), and American English uses more regular verbs, which express a particular action and distinguish between past and present tense more precisely. The Secret Life of the Pronoun, explains: Auxiliary verbs are associated with a passive voice and are frowned on in American English classes but celebrated in British English classes.
There are major differences in spelling as well:Aeroplane  Airplane,Aluminium  Aluminum,Centre  Center, Colour  Color, Cheque  Check, Grey  Gray etc.
It is hard not to wonder how Americans made the switch from honour to honor, colour to color, and centre to center. Did those extra vowels just fall off in the New World as time went by No, it was actually a masterly decision on the part of Noah Webster, an American colonial, who wanted America to have its own independent language, and created the most popular dictionary in the history of the world. Webster cut the letter u out of many words that had an ou inside (flavour, colour, honour). He also changed musick to music and centre to center. He also added some colloquial American words that the British would have never heard of: skunk, and hickory (both derived from popular sayings). Its easy to see the brand-new character of America shine through these words. They sound more abrupt and to the point, less fussy, and they get down to business. There are differences in punctuation too. An American period is a British full stop. And instead of the American parenthesis, they have brackets.
It is obvious then, that the difference between American English and British English goes much farther than You say Tomayto, I say Tomahto. The difference can be found in vocabulary, slang, sentence structure, syllabic emphasis, and even punctuation.
When you are in America you will realize many Americans who love tea would turn up their noses at the idea of adding milk to it. Brits, on the other hand, are known for lacing their strong tea with milk. But, with or without milk, tea is tea. Its served one way in Britain and another way in the United States, but everyone can recognize it for what it is. The language that the chaps in Britain and the blokes in America share is a bit like that as well, spoken differently in two different lands, but somehow understood by both groups of people.
But with slight variations. The following conversation took place between a visiting American and an Eton schoolmaster.
Do you allow your boys to smoke the American asked.
Im afraid not, was the reply.
Can they drink
Good gracious no.
What about dates
Oh, thats quite all right, said the master, as long as they dont eat too many.

Differences between British and American English
* Vocabulary: There are hundreds of everyday words that are different. For example, Brits call the front of a car the bonnet, while Americans call it the hood. Americans go on vacation, while Brits go on holidays, or hols. New Yorkers live in apartments; Londoners live in flats.
* Auxiliary verbs: Brits sometimes use shall to express the future. For example, I shall go home now. Americans know what shall means, but rarely use it in conversation. It seems very formal. Americans would probably use I will go home now.
In question form, a Brit might say, Shall we go now while an American would probably say, Should we go now
When Americans want to express a lack of obligations, they use the helping verb do with negative not followed by need. You do not need to come to work today. Brits drop the helping verb and contract not. You neednt come to work today.
* Past tense verbs: You will also find some small differences with past forms of irregular verbs.
The past tense of learn in American English is learned. British English has the option of learned or learnt. The same rule applies to dreamed and dreamt, burned and burnt, leaned and leant.
Americans tend to use the ed ending; Brits tend to use the -t ending.
to think of the American way as incorrect.
* Spelling: There are hundreds of minor spelling differences American spelling of words like color (from colour), honor (from honour), and labor (from labour).

CICs Rs. 2 bn agri-investment to boost Sri Lankas economy
Sri Lankas long-standing leader in agriculture  the CIC Group  has elevated the countrys agriculture sector via futuristic investments amounting to over Rs. 2 billion, which are now infusing state-of-the-art technology into the industry, thereby making an enduring impact on the livelihoods of farmers.
Cropwiz, one of the countrys largest agriculture projects to be resilient to seasonal weather patterns, is one such futuristic investment, which indicates the potential for protected agriculture at a time during which changing weather patterns are wreaking havoc on the countrys agriculture and food production.
The project, with an investment of approximately Rs. 1 billion  is an international joint venture and employs cutting-edge greenhouse technology which enables climate smart, year-round production, mitigating impact of climate change.
The project employs automated climate control and fertigation systems, as well as hydroponics. The greenhouses are envisaged to be largely self-sufficient and sustainable in terms of water requirement - through the use of a rainwater harvesting water reservoir and state-of-the-art techniques resulting in near-zero water wastage. The project has also generated substantial employment opportunities for area residents.
The Protected Agriculture Site
The Golden Harvest Project, another futuristic initiative with an investment of approximately Rs. 1 billion, which envisages substantially increasing the productivity of corn farming in Sri Lanka, is already making its impact felt in the local industry.
As part of the project two plants with a total dryer and storage capacity of 32,000 MT were constructed by CIC and these are already in operation. In addition, farming communities are provided training and expertise as part of the project, which has thereby enriched the lives of more than 13,400 farmers in Moneragala and Anuradhapura areas. The project also ensurs safer inputs in the production of poultry feeds via the application of proper drying techniques.
Cropwiz
The only seed to shelf agriculture company in Sri Lanka that manages its own farm land, works directly with over 40,000 rural out-grower farmers and produces a variety of agriculture and livestock products such as seed paddy, rice, fruits, vegetables, eggs, yoghurt, curd, etc., under its own brand name for the local and export market, CIC Agri Businesses works with a strong commitment towards enhancing farmer incomes, improving the rural economy and contributing towards the development of agriculture in Sri Lanka.
"While we are charging ahead with these cutting-edge futuristic agri-investments, we are also rationalizing our existing legacy businesses. These new investments need a new mindset and acquiring of new competencies, which is now being addressed via our 2020 re-strategizing project with MTI Consulting, said CIC Holdings Group MD Samantha Ranatunga.

Let not protesters jeopardize our freedom
Freedom is the most hallowed concept that democracy has bestowed on humanity. The love of and the yearning for freedom have been the driving force behind historys greatest revolutions and wars. It is perhaps the strongest pillar on which modern civilization stands. Failure to understand the true meaning of freedom by those enjoying it can certainly be self-destructive.
Going by the unreasonable and futile strikes and protests from village level to the level of professionals and intellectuals it looks as if freedom has reached the endangered stage. With the gross abuse of freedom all too apparent today, regrettably people are beginning to see merit in repressive governance. Comments such as, leaders of strikes and protests and even media personnel giving them publicity would be in hiding had the white van culture existed, have begun to be heard loud and clear on the corridors and watering holes. Indeed freedom is too precious a commodity to be placed in the hands of political imbeciles that dominate our society. There is reason to believe that kind hearted Mother Lanka has gifted Gillettes and Wilkinsons to monkeys!
In post-Independence Sri Lanka, after the 1956 regime led by the great democrat S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike no government has been pounded and peppered by so many organised groups of idiots who cannot differentiate between democratic freedom and dictatorial repression, than the present regime.
It is tragic indeed that strikes and protests that had always been rights and privileges of the working class and indeed the modus operandi created by working class leaders to win concessions and legitimate rights have today been usurped by misguided, politicized professionals and so called intellectuals. Even the budding intellectual community of undergraduates coming mainly from the less affluent segments of society has been misled to join strikes and protests at the risk of irreparable damage to their own futures. The SAITM issue is symbolic of this catastrophic situation. Behind this chaos is the GMOA that comprises men and women who have taken a solemn oath to care for the sick.
The country is badly in need of more doctors. But the GMOA wants only the State Universities to teach medicine. State universities are unable to take all students who qualify for medical studies.
But the GMOA utilizing all resources at its command is preventing the private sector from filling this lacuna. The former clearly has lost its capacity to reason.
When democratic freedoms were curtailed under the last regime the loud mouthed GMOA leaders were blind to the KDU starting a medical faculty.
The GMOAs tail was tucked tightly between its hind legs when the good, great and mighty Gotabhaya held the reigns and disappearances in white vans were the order of the day.
The sinister scam behind the strikes and protests using SAITM as the reason has yet to be properly understood by the country. It is now obvious that by crippling the system the GMOA has maliciously and effectively blocked the emergence of doctors from state Universities for several years to come, an outcome for the GMOA to celebrate with gusto!
Medical education free or otherwise cannot be denied to the qualified and deserving. To deprive this right in ones own country and at the same time compel students and parents to spend millions in foreign exchange and obtain medical degrees from even unheard of Universities outside our shores is nothing short of downright treachery.
The government has every right to deal firmly with the opponents of SAITM who are causing so much inconvenience to the public.
To protect our freedom has today become the foremost responsibility of the State.

Close relationships can extend your lifespan
Loneliness can bring on a slew of health problems, which can eventually lead to an early death, a new report has revealed.
And these problems can begin as early as infancy, the report from the American Psychological Association (ASA) said.
The analysis features a collection of studies from different establishments, all of which conclude that if a person does not have meaningful relationships, their chances of being diagnosed with fatal diseases are higher.
Specific ailments that affect lonely people more are obesity, coronary heart disease, high blood pressure and heart attacks.
For this reason, psychologists are urging public health officials to recognize the 'loneliness epidemic' as a priority, as government agencies are doing little to address the issue.
Dr Julianne Holt-Lunstad, a researcher who contributed to the report, said that up to 43 percent of adults in the US over 60 years old have reported experiencing 'intense loneliness'.
This could be due to the fact that more than one-fourth of the US population lives alone, and over half of the population is not married, Dr Holt-Lunstad said.
She added that the divorce rate of first marriages in the US is 40 percent. One study that the new report looks at, from Brigham Young University, highlights the fact that people in high-quality relationships who feel socially stable have a decreased risk of mortality.
'Social isolation, loneliness and relationship discord are well-established risk factors for poor health,' the report said.
Additionally, the BYU study claimed that government agencies, groups that fund health care and health care providers have not little if anything to categorize loneliness as a public health concern that needs to be prioritized. This is despite the swell of evidence that has come out in recent years, which suggests that companionship positively affects one's health. But the World Health Organization now lists 'social support networks' as a factor that can contribute to one's health, Dr Holt-Lunstad said.
She emphasized that nobody is safe from the 'loneliness epidemic', saying: 'Regardless of one's sex, country or culture of origin or economic background, social connection is crucial to human development, health and survival.'
Other studies presented in the ASA's report echoed this. An example is a study by Northwestern University that looked at the effects relationships have on a child's health. The study found that 'emotionally significant' relationships that provide a child with comfort are associated with better overall health, beginning in infancy and continuing until adulthood.
And children aren't the only ones who benefit. A University of Utah study concluded that marriage can reduce one's chances of coronary heart disease.
But simply having a partner will not provide the benefits: the quality of the partnership is crucial, as strained relationships will actually increase one's risk of having the disease.
The ASA report's editor, Dr Christine Dunkel Schetter, said that the point of the collected research was to make clear the relationship between good health and strong social connections. She said: '[The studies] draw from relationship science and health psychology, two areas of scientific inquiry with independent histories and distinct domains. 'The challenge remains to translate existing and future knowledge into interventions to improve social relationships for the benefit of physical and mental health.

Consent of three doctors mandatory for prison hospital admission
Prisons inmates seeking medicalcare henceforth must obtain consent of three doctors before they can be transferred to the prison hospital for treatment.
This is in keeping with a decision made by Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D. M. Swaminathan.
The minister has ordered Prisons Commissioner General H.M.N.C.Dhanasinghe to see that steps are taken hereafter to carry out prison inmate hospitalisations only upon approval of three doctors.
They would be the doctor in charge of the prison, the OPD doctor and the ward doctor. The former two may give their consent for the admission while the ward doctor would be the one to diagnose and recommend the inmate for hospitalisation, Prison Reforms Ministry sources said.
Minister Swaminathan said, he decided to make the three doctor consent mandatory for prison inmate hospitalisation after considering numerous complaints received by him from various sections of society that the prison inmate hospitalisation process is flawed.
There were allegations of misconduct in this respect, he said.Ministry sources said the allegations are mostly associated with prisoners with political influence getting their way into the prison hospital.
The minister had asked that diagnose reports of inmates seeking medical treatment at the prison hospital should be submitted to the ministry for necessary investigations.

COPE summons RDA over Expressways
The Road Development Authority (RDA) has been summoned before the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) on September 19 to examine the projects related to Expressways.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday that the Committee decided to summon the RDA management as several issues with regard to construction of expressways have surfaced recently.
The JVP in a press conference late last month raised allegations of misappropriation of funds and bribery when constructing the Expressways.
The COPE Chairman said the Sri Lankan Air management was re-summoned before the Committee on September 20. The COPE questioned the Sri Lankan Air authorities even last week. Handunnetti said the investigations on Sri Lankan Air are mainly on the controversial order of eight A350 air buses.
The COPE has directed its attention these days to study the history of this deal. The Government had to pay a large sum as compensation to cancel the orders for those aircraft and thereby incurred a huge loss. The COPE wants study the agreements in detail and find out who is responsible for taking the decisions, he said.

Dating sites cannot predict soulmates
Dating websites that claim to find your soul mate using computer analysis may not really work, say scientists who found that artificial intelligence can only predict who is more desirable, rather than the perfect match.
Researchers found that it was possible to predict the overall tendency for someone to like and to be liked by others using computer analysis - but not which two particular people was a match.
We found we cannot anticipate how much individuals will uniquely desire each other in a speed-dating context with any meaningful level of accuracy, said Samantha Joel, a professor at University of Utah in the US. I thought that out of more than 100 predictors, we would be able to predict at least some portion of the variance. I did not expect we would find zero, Joel added.
It would be great if people were able to circumvent the hassle and heartache of the dating process by entering information into a computer and having it produce the perfect soul mate, researchers said.
Dating can be hard and anxiety provoking and theres a market there for a short cut. What if you could skip to the part where you click with someone But our data suggests that, at least with the tools we currently have available, there isnt an easy fix for finding love, Joel said.
While online dating sites provide a valuable service by narrowing the field and identifying potential romantic prospects, they dont let you bypass the process of having to physically meet someone to find out how you feel about them, he said. Researchers used a cutting-edge machine learning algorithm to test whether it was possible to predict unique romantic desire based on participants questionnaire responses and before the individuals met.
They found it was possible to predict the overall tendency for someone to like and to be liked by others  but not which two particular people was a match.

Dengue threatens Ampara
Coastal residents in the Ampara district said monsoon rains resulted in increasing mosquito breeding grounds in the area.
Several dengue patients were identified in the coastal areas and if preventive measures are not taken on time, another outbreak of dengue is imminent, they warned.
Health officials warned residents against dengue and asked them to eradicate dengue mosquito breeding grounds by maintaining their gardens, workplaces, and residents clean and tidy.
Garbage dumps in the areas worsens the situation. Those who dump wastage recklessly will be dealt with legally in order to control the disease, authorities said.
Low lying coastal areas were inundated turning them to ideal breading grounds for dengue mosquitoes, residents said.
The drainage system in the areas were blocked, they complained. Many dengue eradication programmes were in progress in the district, health officials said.

Disturbed sleep patterns may be key to ADHD
Struggling to concentrate, having too much energy and being unable to control behaviour  the main manifestations of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD)  have been linked to disruptions in sleep, researchers revealed recently.
The findings underline a growing awareness among doctors that disturbed sleep is associated with many major health hazards. Other ailments linked to the problem include obesity, diabetes and heart disease. The work opens up the possibility of developing treatments for ADHD without drugs, the researchers say.
Speaking at a pharmacology conference in Paris, Professor Sandra Kooij, of VU University Medical Centre in Amsterdam, outlined research which shows poor sleep is a sign that the timings of many physiological processes are not properly synchronised.
The onset of ADHD is one of the clear signs that this is taking place. Our research is making clear that sleep disruption and ADHD are intertwined. Essentially, they are two sides of the same physiological and mental coin, said Kooij, speaking before her presentation.
Symptoms of ADHD, which also include mood swings and impulsiveness, are generally noticed at a fairly early age, often when a child is being sent to school for the first time, although cases are sometimes not recognised until adulthood. It is estimated that between 2% and 5% of people are affected by ADHD at some time. According to Kooij, the condition is very often inherited and usually has a pronounced neurological background.
In addition, about 80% of cases are associated with profound sleep disturbances. This is most frequently manifested as delays in the onset of sleep, Kooij told delegates at the annual congress of the European College of Neuropsychopharmacology in Paris.
People simply cannot go to bed and fall sleep at the end of the day like others, she said. And that has consequences. Affected individuals sometimes cannot get to sleep until around 3am but they still have to get up to go to work or school. The result is a drastic loss of sleep.
This problem is linked, in turn, to disturbances in levels of the neurological transmitters dopamine and melatonin in the brain, she said. These chemicals control when we fall asleep and when we wake up by directing the brains circadian system, the internal biological clock which keeps us in sync with the 24-hour day.
Other conditions linked to disturbed dopamine and melatonin levels include restless leg syndrome  an irresistible urge to move your legs  and sleep apnoea, in which breathing is disturbed during sleep. These disorders are also linked to ADHD, said Kooij.
This claim is backed by Professor Andreas Reif, of University Hospital, Frankfurt. A disturbance of the circadian system may indeed be a core mechanism in ADHD but beyond these considerations, sleep abnormalities are a huge problem for many patients, heavily impacting on their social life.
More research is very relevant to improve patients lives. The crucial point is that a cascade of health disorders, including ADHD, appear to be triggered by disruptions to circadian rhythms, offering some routes to counter these conditions by attempting to restore a patients body clock. Kooij said her team was now looking for biomarkers, such as vitamin D levels, blood glucose, cortisol levels, 24-hour blood pressure, and heart-rate variability that are associated with sleeplessness.
Once we can do that, we may be able to treat some ADHD by non-pharmacological methods, such as changing light or sleep patterns. We may also be able to prevent the negative impact of chronic sleep loss on health in general. -theguardian.com

## Title: End this farce

End this farce
Rehabilitation and Prisons Reforms Minister D.M. Swaminathan wants three doctors to examine prisoners, to decide if they (prisoners) warrant being admitted to the prisons hospital, rather than a single doctor, as is the case presently. This is with a view to prevent the abuse of the facility by some prisoners, the minister declared. The public, no doubt, are nonplussed as to how some VIP politicians, who not so long ago were bristling with good health and vitality suddenly fall ill after entering prison. The other day, a visibly robust Sarana Gunawardena was reported to have entered the prisons hospital, only moments after entering prison. No doubt, there is something terribly wrong in the whole screening process to decide the criteria allowing politicians to enter the prison hospital.
Not just the abuse of the prison hospital, it also amounts to belittling of the court verdict that put accused behind bars. It is also tantamount to ridiculing the judge who delivered the verdict and a complete mockery of the whole justice system. Interestingly, the propensity to make a beeline to the prisons hospital, no sooner they enter prison, is an affliction common to VIP prisoners. Both Lalith Weeratunge and Anusha Palpita, who were placed behind bars after Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga found them guilty for distributing sil redi using public funds, on the eve of the last Presidential election, sought refuge in the prisons hospital pronto, pleading they were diabetics. We are not aware of any instance of either of them receiving treatment at a state or private hospital recently.
Here were two individuals who looked quite hale and hearty and were seen practically beaming from ear to ear after sentencing, outside the court premises, suddenly discovering that their sugar levels have risen to the stratosphere, no sooner their cell doors were clanged shut. It was the same with former Minister Basil Rajapaksa, who was given the returning hero welcome by supporters at the BIA, months after his nocturnal departure overseas following his brothers defeat on January 8. An arms flailing and wild gesticulating Rajapaksa, who looked the picture of good health, as was seen on television, suddenly developed some mysterious ailment after being arrested and thrown behind bars, promptly heading for the prisons hospital.
On a subsequent occasion when the younger Rajapaksa was again an inmate at the state guest house the practice was repeated and when questioned by a journalist as to why he always went to the prisons hospital, while in prison, said it was the result of the tension, which results in the rise in blood pressure and sugar levels. If that be the case the prison hospital should by now be bursting at the seams, given that a majority of the prisoners, particularly the first timers, no doubt, would have undergone the same tension, triggering a shooting up of their blood pressure and sugar levels. Or, is it that they being mere mortals, they are denied the comfort of the prison hospital, with the obvious application of double standards, by the examining physician
Not just Basil, all politicians in recent times, followed the practice, so much so it has now become habit forming. S.B. Dissanayake spent the entire two years of his sentence for Contempt of Court at the prisons hospital while Duminda Silva, who is on death row, also spent a substantial period at the same facility. It is a strange coincidence, indeed, how the physician appointed to determine the plausibility of the requests of prisoners to be admitted to the prisons hospital invariably find all politicians to be eligible. It is not only abuse of the system but unfair on the ordinary prisoner who has no influence or money power. It is also a negation of the concept of equality before the law and a blatant mockery of the justice system. It is indeed revealing, as to how politicians, who after being sentenced, raise their manacled hands in a display of bravado outside court houses suddenly become meek as kittens, not having the courage to spend time in jail and always seek the relative comfort of the prisons hospital.
It is time to put a stop to this farce. Medical officers, obviously, don't want to get on the wrong side of powerful politicians, in the Opposition, sent to prison, fearing retaliation in the event of a regime change. Minister Swaminathan should factor in this possibility and make a careful selection of the panel. Malpractice too should not be ruled out in the whole affair. There is no known instance recorded where messrs. Colvin R. De Silva, Philip Gunawardena or Edmund Samarakkody ever sought the comfort of the prisons hospital during their period of incarceration. Perhaps they were made of sterner stuff than the present day politicians, who, one could only describe as cardboard heroes.
With more VIP politicians billed to enter the prison gates, soon, it will be interesting to see if the panel of three doctors to be appointed, will dare give them a clean bill of health, barring their pleas to be admitted to the prisons hospital or if the present trend continues.

Fatally flawed life
This week Consultant Community Physician and the President of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka and the National Programme Manager of the Maternal and Child Morbidity and Mortality Surveillance of the Family Health Bureau, Health Ministry, Dr. KapilaJayaratne speaks about Lethal Congenital Malformations. This is a severe antenatal diagnosis of a severe congenital malformation associated wth profound grief, sadness and anger.
Q - What are Lethal Congenital Malformations (LCM)
A - Abnormalities of the baby that originated in the uterus and are associated with death in the womb itself or in the newborn period are often referred to as lethal congenital malformations. Any structural or functional anomaly of organs, systems, or parts of the body that occurs during intrauterine life which is caused by genetic or environmental factors evident before birth, at birth or later in life are considered as Congenital Malformations or birth defects. Those conditions with the poorest prognosis are labeled lethal particularly when the condition is associated with a high rate of prenatal (or stillbirth) or neonatal death. It is a condition which leads to death in utero or during the newborn period regardless of attempted supportive treatment. This is not a single entity.
They include a heterogenous group of conditions as there are a multitude of individually rare conditions termed lethal.
Consultant Community Physician and the President of the Perinatal Society of Sri Lanka and the National Programme Manager of the Maternal and Child Morbidity and Mortality Surveillance attached to the Family Health Bureau of the Health Ministry, Dr. Kapila Jayaratne.
To list some of them; Potters syndrome/renal agenesis, Anencephaly/acrania, Thanatophoric dwarfism, Trisomy 13 or 18, Holoprosencephaly, Severe osteogenesisimperfecta, Multicystic/dysplastic kidneys, Triploidy, Hydranencephaly, Congenital severe hydrocephalus with absent or minimal brain growth, Severe congenital diaphragmatic hernia with hypoplastic lungs. WHO estimates 303, 000 newborns die within four weeks of birth every year, worldwide, due to all types of congenital anomalies. The estimated figure for Sri Lanka is 500  600. A major proportion of stillbirths are also due to birth defects. These statistics also show the importance of congenital anomalies as a major cause of perinatal, neonatal, and infant deaths.
Q How can Lethal Congenital Malformations be diagnosed
A  Being aheterogenous group of conditions, screening or diagnostic tests vary. Some conditions may be apparent early in the pregnancy and some in the latter part of pregnancy.
Gross malformations may be detected by ultrasound scans. The use of routine mid-trimester ultrasound screening picks many of the diagnosis of major congenital malformations. In many parts of the world, major malformations are discovered before birth. Several conditions necessitate blood investigations of the mother or the fetus. Antenatal screening follows targeted diagnostic testing for specific LCM.
Q How can the mother and the fetus be treated once diagnosed 
A  The diagnosis of an LCM has potential ethical and legal implications.
They need different antenatal or obstetric management depending on the underlying abnormality. The interventions may be focused on both maternal and babys well-being.
However, as the presence of a lethal malformation precludes any benefit to the fetus from the pregnancy continuing, many countries offer termination of pregnancy within their legal framework. As termination of pregnancy is only possible if the mothers life in danger in Sri Lanka, the only option available is continuation of pregnancy until baby dies or till he is born.
In this background, ethical issues arise on what treatment should be offered or provided to women and to fetuses and babies with a high chance of death despite treatment. The pain and suffering of the mother, living children and family is inevitable in Sri Lanka.
Within the contexts our healthcare teams proceed with planning of delivery, counseling and education of couples and earlier supportive postnatal intervention for newborns with lethal congenital malformations. It is also a burden to the health system, society and the country as they consume a huge proportion of healthcare facilities and budgets as well.
Q How can Lethal Congenital Malformations be prevented
A  In about 50 percent of all congenital anomalies cannot be linked to a specific cause. Although there are some known genetic, environmental and other causes or risk factors, a specific plausibility cannot be attributed in many. However, in certain genetic conditions it may be possible to predict. Therefore, genetic counseling and birth defect screening, particularly if couples have any family history of birth defects or the mother is 35 years of age or older can be of use to prevent the pain caused by this condition. Other advice includes controlling diabetes and avoiding harmful substances. We advocate carefully planned pregnancies in ideal age with ideal body weight and attending to pre-existing illnesses. Pre-pregnancy counseling for high risk couples is also recommended.
* Annually 500  600 congenital anomalies are reportedin Sri Lanka
* As termination of pregnancy is only possible if the mothers life in danger in Sri Lanka, the only option available is continuation of pregnancy until baby dies or till he is born.
* As the presence of a lethal malformation precludes any benefit to the fetus from the pregnancy continuing, many countries offer termination of pregnancy within their legal framework.
* LCM is also a burden to the health system, society and the country as they consume a huge proportion of healthcare facilities and budgets.

The Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with her third child, is keen on the idea of a home birth
However, after the births of Prince George and his sister proved to be problem-free, my sources tell me Kate will be on much stronger ground this time.
It would spare Kate the ordeal of facing hundreds of paparazzi, as she had to do straight after leaving the maternity unit with George and Charlotte, and allow her children to meet their sibling in the privacy of their own home.
My well-placed informant says: The Duchess knew it wasnt possible for her first baby to be born at home, but she asked for a home birth for the second. Officials and doctors thought it too risky. There was concern and in the end she decided against it.
The Duchess, 35, thought to be less than 12 weeks pregnant, has been suffering extreme morning sickness, as she did with both her other pregnancies. It caused her to miss Georges first day of school last week. If she gets the go-ahead for home birth this time, she will be reverting to Royal tradition. The Queen had her four children at Buckingham Palace, and Queen Victoria was born at Kensington Palace in 1819.
The Cambridge children were born in the Lindo Wing of St Marys Hospital, Paddington, where the 5,000-a-night suites have the latest technology and access to St Marys next door in the event of an emergency.
The Duchesss wish for a home birth last time was taken so seriously that the route from Kensington to St Marys was timed in case of any scare.
My source adds: The Duke and Duchess decided not to take the risk last time. A similar request with the third baby would be more acceptable. A spokesman for the Cambridges declined to comment.

Government announces regulations on tuk-tuks

The Ministry of Transport and Civil Aviation has issued the gazette streamlining three-wheelers used for passenger transport.
The Ministry had promised to issue guidelines in January of this year given the increasing rates of accidents caused by three-wheelers.
The Extraordinary Gazette No 2035/51 issued on 8 September not only issues specific guidelines on the vehicle specifications of three-wheelers used for passenger transport but has also stressed on the need to stick to the speed limit of 40km/hr as stated in the provisions of the Motor Traffic (Speed Limits) Regulations No 1 of 2012. The speedometer must be fixed in a place visible to the passenger so he/she is aware of the speed in which the driver is traveling in.
In addition it has been made compulsory to have a taximeter fitted and in operation throughout the hire. At the end of a hire, the driver must issue a receipt to the passenger with details of the distance travelled, vehicle registration number, amount charged and date.
Furthermore, three-wheeler owners have been asked to clearly display to passengers; the registration number, name and driving license number of the driver, photograph of the driver and telephone numbers of the respective police stations where the vehicle is registered in case of an emergency.
Regulations for carrying passengers include; behaving in a civil and orderly manner, not smoke, not terminate hire before he has been discharged by the hire, and carry passengers to their destinations by the shortest possible route within the shortest time unless requested otherwise.
Owners or drivers of three-wheelers have also been warned to not permit any person to distribute leaflets while the vehicle is in motion. In addition, three-wheelers will also be cautioned against blaring music or any sound from their vehicle while in motion or when parked in a manner which would annoy or disturb road users.
Moreover, three-wheelers have also been restricted from using, letters or digits on their vehicle apart from the information marked thereon by the manufacturer, on the front or back of the vehicle. This would remove all decorative stickers and material from the body of the vehicle.

Hurricane Irma: Eye of storm hits Florida west coast

The centre of Hurricane Irma has hit mainland Florida, just south of Naples, amid warnings of storm surges as high as 15ft (4.5m).
Irma made landfall on Marco Island off Florida's west coast with winds of up to 120mph (192km/h), but has since been downgraded from category three to two.
More than 3.4 million homes in the state are without power, and parts of the city of Miami are under water.
Three storm-related deaths have been reported, as Irma moves northwards.
In its latest update at 03:00 GMT Monday,the National Hurricane Center (NHC) says "hurricane conditions are continuing across portions of the central Florida peninsula".
Irma currently has maximum sustained winds of 100mph (160km/h), the NHC says.
The storm was earlier pummelling the area around the city of Fort Myers.
Irma has already devastated parts of the Caribbean, killing at least 28 people.
Some 6.3 million people in Florida had been told to evacuate.
President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration and emergency federal aid for Florida.
He described the hurricane as a "big monster", praising the federal agencies involved with the storm and saying he would go to the state "very soon".
"We may have been a little bit lucky in that it went on the west, and it may not have been quite as disruptive, but we're going to see, it's going to play out over the next five or six hours," Mr Trump added.
Where is the storm now
At 03:00 GMT, the centre of the hurricane was about 50 miles (80km) south-east of the city of Tampa.
Some 3m people live in the Tampa Bay area. The region has not been hit by a major hurricane since 1921.
Irma is now losing strength, the NHC says, predicting that Irma will become a tropical storm over "far northern Florida or southern Georgia on Monday".
"On the forecast track, the centre of Irma will continue to move over the western Florida peninsula through Monday morning and then into the south-eastern United States late Monday and Tuesday."
The storm made landfall at Marco Island at 15:35 local time (19:35 GMT).
The NHC earliertweetedthat people in the area of Naples and Marco Island should move away from the coast as storm surges of up to 15ft were possible.
There has been some flooding in the centre of Naples but it is believed to be fresh water. How did it arrive in Florida
After leaving the coast of Cuba, Irma barrelled through the Florida Keys, a chain of low-lying islands to the south, on Sunday morning.
Media reports say a man was killed on Saturday in the Keys when his truck crashed into a tree as the outer bands of the storm arrived.
The whole of the southern tip of Florida has seen high winds, driving rain and storm surges.
About 2ft (60cm) of water has been seen in Miami's financial district, where one major street resembled a river, but the worst damage is expected on the west coast.
Two cranes have collapsed in high winds in the city.
Which other areas have already been hit
Irma is the most powerful Atlantic storm in a decade, and has already caused widespread destruction on several Caribbean islands:
Cuba:Officials have talked of "significant damage", without giving further details, but no casualties have been reported. Electricity is out across the capital, Havana
St Martin and St Barthelemy:Six out of 10 homes on St Martin, an island shared between France and the Netherlands, are now uninhabitable, French officials say. They said nine people had died and seven were missing in the French territories, while four are known to have died in Dutch Sint Maarten
Turks and Caicos Islands:Widespread damage, although extent unclear
Barbuda:The small island is said to be "barely habitable", with 95% of the buildings damaged. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne estimates reconstruction will cost $100m (80m). One death has been confirmed
Anguilla:Extensive damage with one person confirmed dead
Puerto Rico:More than 6,000 residents of the US territory are in shelters and many more without power. At least three people have died
British Virgin Islands:Widespread damage reported, and five dead
US Virgin Islands:Damage to infrastructure was said to be widespread, with four deaths confirmed
Haiti and the Dominican Republic:Both battered by the storm, but neither had as much damage as initially feared

Independence Cup in Pakistan - opportunity to boost T20I rankings
Several leading players from the world over will get a chance to enhance their Twenty20 International rankings in the upcoming three-match Independence Cup series against Pakistan to be played under lights at the Gaddafi Stadium in Lahore on 12, 13 and 15 September.
The Faf du Plessis-led World XI side has five players from South Africa and also a selection of big names from six other Test playing countries in a series that has been given T20I status and hence performances will count in the calculation of individual rankings.
Not surprisingly, the high-profile T20I series brings together several top-level competitors including three of the top five bowlers in the MRF Tyres ICC T20I Players Rankings getting to display their wares. Pakistans left-arm spinner Imad Wasim leads the T20I rankings table for bowlers while two former number-one bowlers feature in the World XI side.
Imad is way ahead of others at a career-best 780 points as of now, but leg-spinners Imran Tahir of South Africa and Samuel Badree of the West Indies, currently in second and fifth places, respectively, will also be eyeing the opportunity of doing well for the World XI and moving up the rankings. Tahir is presently on 744 points while Badree is on 714 points.
Tahir has spent 269 days as the top-ranked T20I bowler from September 2016 to June 2017 while Badree has spent most time at the top with a total of 785 days. He reached the top for the first time in March 2014 while his most recent stint as the top-ranked bowler was in September 2016.
In the rankings for batsmen, du Plessis is the top-ranked player from either side at eighth position while his compatriot Hashim Amla (15th) and Bangladeshs left-handed opener Tamim Iqbal (41st) are the other prominent names in terms of rankings for the visiting side. Babar Azam (27th) and Shoaib Malik (34th) are the leading batsmen for the home side.

Injury fightback lifts gritty Stephens to US Open crown
NEW YORK, Saturday  Sloane Stephens spent 11 months sidelined by a left foot injury and the surgery that followed, never dreaming when she returned at Wimbledon in July her first Grand Slam title was only two months away.
But the storybook tale played out just that way as the 24-year-old American won for the 15th time in 17 matches, defeating fellow American and best friend Madison Keys 6-3, 6-0 in Saturday's US Open women's final.
Stephens, who had won only $310,000 this year, took a top prize of $3.7 million after learning much about herself and her tennis passion since being hurt last year.
That I'm a real fighter, that I have a lot of grit. I don't give up, Stephens said.
I'm not just going to let them take it from me. I'm going to make sure I give everything I have, and I leave everything on the court at all times, no matter what.
It's a determination bred in frustration after being forced to watch the Australian Open from her couch unable to walk after surgery in January. She still needed a walking boot in June.
I was super limited. I was walking on a peg leg, so that whole 15 weeks was super tough, Stephens said. I think that was my toughest time. But it brought a clarity of thought that has enhanced her perspective.
My head is a little clearer, if that makes any sense, she said. Before, I was playing well. I had won a couple tournaments. But being injured gave me a whole new perspective on tennis, on life, and just in general.
Stephens is the daughter of former NFL player John Stephens, who played five seasons with the New England Patriots before joining Green Bay and Kansas City. His final season came just months after Sloane was born.
He died in a 2009 car accident. Sloane turned professional just weeks later.
Tennis is very situational, Stephens said. Once you realize that it's not life or death out there, you can turn a tennis match around. If you work really hard, if you fight your way through and fight your way back, you can make some things happen for yourself.
Unsure of her strength, she tested her limits and reached US Open semi-finals at Toronto and Cincinnati, finding her skills quickly recovering into top form.
When I came back from injury, I didn't have all of my tools. I didn't know if I was going to be able to run down every ball, didn't know if my power and timing was still going to be there. I didn't know if everything was still going to be right, she said.
The only thing I had to rely on was my fight and making sure every time I was on the court I gave my all. If I just stay positive with myself, I can make a lot of things happen, and I can fight back from a lot of things.
Stephens made her best prior Grand Slam run to the 2013 Australian Open semi-finals.
I was a baby then. I didn't know as much as I know now. A lot of life has happened. I have been through a lot, Stephens said. I don't regret it. Everything happens for a reason. Maybe I was a baby. Maybe I was too young. Who knows I'm just happy to be playing.  AFP

Interbrand to introduce Best Sri Lankan Brands in 2017
Interbrand has announced the introduction of its Best Sri Lankan Brands table in 2017. The ranking, which will identify the best performing Sri Lankan brands, is modeled on Interbrands prestigious annual Best Global Brands report, the definitive guide to the worlds 100 most valuable brands.
To maintain reputational integrity and avoid any conflicts of interest, Interbrand does not levy or accept payments to list brands in its table. It also does not accept sponsors. Managing Director, Interbrand India, Ashish Mishra said this was a highly irregular practice that was not found anywhere in the world.
Established in 1974 and an opinion leader in the field of value-based brand management, Interbrand was the first brand consultancy to recognize the significance of a brand as a business asset and introduce the brand valuation concept.
Interbrands Best Global Brands methodology valuates each brands financial performance, role, and strength through a five-step Economic Value Added methodology which is also the first of its kind to be ISO certified.
In a statement welcoming the introduction of the ranking table to Sri Lanka, Mike Rocha, Interbrands Global Director, Brand Valuation, Interbrand London, said, Interbrand believes strong brands enhance business through their influence on customers, employees, and investors; they influence customer choice and create loyalty; attract, retain, and motivate talent; and lower the cost of financing. Interbrands brand valuation methodology has been specifically designed to take all of these stakeholders and value-creation levers into account."
"Role of Brand analysis is about understanding purchase behaviour: the brands influence on the generation of demand through choice.
Brand Strength measures the ability of the brand to create continuity of demand into the future through loyalty and therefore, to reduce risk. In doing this it considers internal factors  the management and employees  and external factors  the customers. Finally these inputs are combined with a financial model of the business to measure the brands ability to create economic value for its owner.
Addressing the media conference held in Colombo, Mishra said, Interbrand sees strong, respected businesses in Sri Lanka that are now ready for change. Brands are intangible assets, but they are hugely valuable economic assets that thrive on a strategic agenda that directly influences the growth of their businesses. These are the important discussions Interbrand wants to have in Sri Lanka so that brands can experience growth on both a domestic and global scale.
Mishra also emphasized the need for Sri Lankan brands to evolve beyond borders, their industries and geographies: In todays converged markets, a global brand outlook is not just a matter of aspiration but an imperative. Before 2001, the only Asian brands listed on the Best Global Brands table were Japanese and about a decade ago, Samsung entered the listing from South Korea, joined four years later by LG and Hyundai. Interbrands larger purpose is to identify the Best Sri Lankan Brands today and in the future, and help them in their journey towards becoming Best Global Brands.
Michel Nugawela, CEO, MND and Sri Lanka partner for Interbrand said, For the past 15 years, MND has been working to raise the bar of Sri Lankan brand management practices. Im therefore extremely pleased that we can today announce the introduction of Best Sri Lankan Brands.
Interbrands brand valuation methodology is the most rigorous and respected formula in the world; it is the global benchmark and we look forward to beginning conversations with business leaders on the value and role of the brand to directly influence the growth of their businesses, and celebrate the most valuable Sri Lankan brands every year.
Interbrand first entered the Sri Lankan market in 2016 with the rebranding of Hatton National Bank together with Sri Lankan partner MND.
Interbrands impressive portfolio of clients include brand leaders in every industry, category and segment including HSBC, American Express, Credit Suisse, Barclays, Swiss Re, Allstate, and Bank of America in financial services; GE, Shell, IBM, KPMG and Godrej in diversified sectors; FedEx, UPS, DHL, British Airways, KLM, Thai, Iberia, Lufthansa, Singapore Airlines and Maersk in logistics and transportation; Unilever, P&G, Nestle, Kraft, Nivea, Knorr and Wrigley in CPG/FMCG; FIFA, Rugby Football Union, Ryder Cup, USGA and Sochi Olympics in sport branding; Gucci, Prada, Rolls Royce, Cartier, Piaget, Hugo Boss, Bulgari and Remy Martin in the luxury segment; as well as cities, regions and nations such as Edinburgh, Johannesburg, Monitoba, South Korea, Holland and Chile.
Interbrand also created the first Korean Top 100 brand, Samsung, by introducing the brand value concept to the conglomerate and propelling it to the 7th most valuable brand ranking in the Best Global Brands table, worth over $45bn in 2015.
Sri Lankan partner MND specializes in brand strategy, brand architecture, brand identity and change management solutions across multiple industries, categories and segments.
MND has branded and repositioned many of Sri Lankas most iconic and respected brands, including Aitken Spence, Elephant House, Lion Lager, Ceylinco Life, and Goodhope among others.

IRMA lashes Florida leaving trail of DESTRUCTION
US: Hurricane Irma began pummeling Florida late Saturday, threatening almost the entire southeastern US state after cutting a deadly path of destruction through the Caribbean.
Tens of thousands of Floridians were hunkering down in shelters for a direct hit from the monster storm, after more than 6.3 million -- nearly a third of the states population -- were ordered to evacuate.
For those still at home, it was already too late to escape the wrath of what could be the worst hurricane in storm-prone Florida.
If you have been ordered to evacuate anywhere in the state, you need to leave right now. Not tonight. Not in an hour. Now. You are running out of time to make a decision, Governor Rick Scott said hours before wind gusts began to lash the island chain known as the Florida Keys.
He said some 76,000 people had already lost power, cautioning that its going to get worse... This is going to be massive. At North Collier Regional Park, a designated shelter just outside the city of Naples, anxious evacuees prayed they and their loved ones would remain safe when the storm made landfall.
All we wanted to make sure is to feel safe and whatever happens we just have to start I guess from the beginning, Viviana Sierra said.
MacDill Air Force Base, the military installation home to US Central Command, issued mandatory evacuation orders with the eye of the storm expected to pass over its home city of Tampa early Monday. The Kennedy Space Center was also closed.
The White House said President Donald Trump, Vice President Mike Pence and their cabinet were briefed on Hurricanes Irma and Jose, with Trump warning on Twitter that this is a storm of enormous destructive power. After blasting through the nearby Cuban coastline, Irma weakened from a maximum-strength Category Five to a Category Three storm, though it was still packing winds of 125 miles (200 kilometer) per hour.
There was a serious threat of flooding from storm surges of up to 15 feet (4.5 meters) along Floridas west coast -- enough to cover a house.
At least 25 people have been killed since Irma began its devastating march through the Caribbean earlier this week.
Terrified Cubans who rode out Irma in coastal towns after the storm made landfall Friday on the Camaguey archipelago reported deafening winds, uprooted trees and power lines, and blown rooftops.
There were no immediate reports of casualties, but officials reported significant damage. A total of 1.5 million people were evacuated. In Florida, cities on both the east and west coasts of the peninsular state took on the appearance of ghost towns, as nervous residents heeded insistent evacuation orders.
The storm was expected to move along or near Floridas southwest Gulf coast by Sunday afternoon.
But Irma is so wide that authorities were bracing for destructive storm surges on both coasts and the Keys, the chain of low-lying islands that stretch south of Miami toward Cuba.
And hurricane-force winds are expected to lash the peninsula as it rolls north toward Georgia.
A tornado funnel cloud has already formed off the coast of Fort Lauderdale, with the NHC warning that a few more were possible in south and central Florida.
On highway 75 along the western coast of Florida, a steady stream of cars pressed northward as thousands fled at the last minute from the fast-approaching killer hurricane.
Bumper-to-bumper traffic snaked north out of the state, with mattresses, gas cans and kayaks strapped to car roofs.
Strip malls, fast food restaurants and retail giants were all closed for business.
In Key West, police opened a shelter of last resort for those who had ignored mandatory evacuation orders.
Scott Abraham, who lives on the fifth floor of a beachfront apartment building in Miami Beach, is planning to ignore evacuation orders and ride the storm out with his wife and two kids.
If I lived in a house I would have left, but if it gets flooded here its going to take a week at least to come back. I dont want that, he said.
Warning that Irma would be worse than Hurricane Andrew -- which killed 65 people in 1992 -- Scott, Floridas governor, said all 20.6 million Floridians should prepare to flee.
Cuban-American Orlando Reyes, 82, was forced to leave his assisted living facility in Miami Beach.
It is frightening, he told AFP at a shelter in Miami. We had to leave without a cent, without taking a bath, or bringing anything.
The storm smashed through a string of Caribbean islands, beginning with tiny Barbuda on Wednesday, followed by the holiday islands of Saint Barthelemy and Saint Martin.
Also affected were the US Virgin Islands, Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Haiti and the Turks and Caicos. The Bahamas were spared Irmas worst.
Houses are smashed, the airport is out of action, Saint Barthelemy resident Olivier Toussaint said.
Upside-down cars are in the cemeteries. Boats are sunk in the marina, shops are destroyed. Another powerful storm, Category Four Hurricane Jose, was heading toward the same string of Caribbean islands Irma has pummeled in recent days, though it was now forecast to be weaker than initially expected.
The deteriorating weather grounded aircraft and prevented boats from bringing relief supplies to hard-hit islands.
The US military was mobilizing thousands of troops and deploying several large ships to aid with evacuations and humanitarian relief, as the Air Force removed scores of planes from the southern United States. - AFP

Japan helps repair Kotapolas flood-hit houses
The ceremony for repaired houses which were damaged by flood and landslides in May was held in Kotapola, Matara, in the presence of Japanese Embassys Deputy Head of Missions Koji Yagi, Kotapola Assistant Divisional Secretary Shanika I. Perera and PARCIC Project Manager Chisato Takahashi.
The monsoon torrential rain in May hit across the country and caused serious loss and damages in Ratnapura, Kalutara and Matara Districts. Especially in the Matara District, a large number of houses were damaged and the affected families were displaced to shelters.
In response to this situation, a Japanese NGO, PARCIC, had decided to implement this project with financial support of 30 million JPY (Approx. Rs. 42 million), from Japan Platform which was jointly established by NGOs, business communities and the Government of Japan.
About 150 families in 15 Grama Niladhari Divisions of the Matara District will benefit through rebuilding/repairing of 50 partially damaged houses, 100 kitchens and 25 toilets, providing construction material and skilled laborers.
In addition, non-food items such first-aid kits will be also provided to 200 families in this project. In addition to PARCIC, several other Japanese NGOs have been working on disaster relief projects in different areas to support the affected communities by the flood and landslides. The Government of Japan hopes goodwill of the people of Japan will contribute to the early recovery of livelihood in the affected areas.

JUSTICE, INDEPENDENCE AND ACCOUNTABILITY
We are regaled ad nauseum now with reports and updates on all manner of legal processes in the country. Is it working A statement by the Asian Human Rights Commission (AHRC) refers to an important debate taking place now on the need for judicial reforms. A debate the result of a statement made by the Bar Association of Sri Lanka with regard to a public statement made by Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake MP. A debate must ensue and we must adopt what works best for us.
A Rapid Assessment of the Justice Sector in Sri Lanka
Objective - To understand what justice means in Sri Lanka and the current standards and systems in different sectors of the justice system
Specifically: Arrive at a situation analysis of the justice sector, identify gaps and challenges in the justice sector design a blueprint for reform with sectoral work plans set up a Committee to guide and monitor the implementation of the work plan.
Sectors for assessment - Administration of Justice - Judiciary and judicial process, court processes;
Law enforcement  Police; Access to justice- Prosecutions Attorney Generals Department, Private Bar, Legal aid, Mediation, Probation and Childcare, Administrative process  Ministry of Justice
AHRC on problems
The system of policing - which is the premier crime investigation institution in the country - is clearly unable to cope up with its primary obligations and public complaints about this institution have been seriously on the rise.
The criminal investigation process which is envisaged in the Criminal Procedure Code is being often neglected to an extent that a tendency has developed among the public to distrust the possibility of the pursuit of justice even for very serious crimes.
People look for alternative methods for solving disputes rather than relying on the legal process.
It is therefore, essential to improve the supervisory role over criminal investigations both by the prosecutors (Attorney Generals Department) and the judiciary itself.
Improvement of accountability for investigation into crimes, by the higher authorities of the police and proper exercise of their command responsibility are some of the essential requirements of such improvements.
Absence of a regulatory process where public complaints against the failures of the system is authentically, competently and speedily investigated is one of the major causes of the failures in the justice system.
The speedy introduction of a regulatory framework over the legal profession as a whole, must be urgently attended to, if any credible change is to take place.
Some months back the Minister in charge of Prisons has said his Ministry is currently working with the Justice Ministry to address issues such as no date cases and overcrowding.
How does one have a case with No date Though practically there is such a category of persons facing indefinite incarceration without a sentence pronounced on them.
These factors scream at the face of any decent citizen and public at large. The report of two UN Rapporteurs was damning on our systems of Justice. In age in which Cabinet papers can be accessed under the Right to Information Act this writer espouses a Justice audit. The salient features are spelled out.

Lankas Sea Life Complex, Maldives sold out
Sri Lankas first ever overseas mega apartment project, the Sea Life Complex (SLC) constructed by Coral Property Developers Colombo in the island of Hulhumale, Maldives has been entirely sold out. This has been accomplished almost year before its completion date.
The Sea Life Project, which is close to the capital Male offers 3,500 apartments and are being constructed at the cost of US$ 70 million.
The first 1,000 units will be completed by 2018. The extent of the island is 60 hectares.
Coral Holdings, Chairman Dr. Piraba Subramaniam
To date this is the biggest apartment project and also the biggest private sector JV operation to date in the Maldives. Ahmed Moosa Mohamed of Sea Life Global Inc (Pvt) Ltd is the Maldivian partner.
Coral Holdings, Chairman Dr. Piraba Subramaniam said that this shows the investor confidence Maldivians have for Sri Lankan built projects and also shows the growing demand for apartments in the Maldives as well.
This is also our first project overseas and the success has inspired us to look at similar ventures overseas. We are now aggressively looking at more such projects in both Canada and in the Gulf.
Construction projects of this nature immensely help to grain foreign exchange to Sri Lanka, offer employment to Sri Lankans in foreign countries and most importantly carry Sri Lanka brand name overseas enticing more invests to invest back in Sri Lanka.
Maldivian Housing and Infrastructure Minister Dr. Mohammed Muizzu who was present at the signing of the agreement has said that he welcomed Sri Lankan investors to commence more business ventures in the Maldives in the years to come.
The complex consists of three lots with three blocks each and two towers in each block. The towers are high-rise buildings with up to fourteen floors.
The towers are connected from the third floor with a skywalk bridge. Each tower has a multitude of apartments from one room studio units to three room units and luxurious penthouse units.
The facility include, the largest luxury shopping arcade, boutique shops and salons, Cafes & restaurants, swimming pool & sports complex, a business centre with meeting and conference facilities, office spaces, one-stop bill pay faculties and parking.

Magic and risk of a handwritten letter
Guten Tag, I say to Herr Schroeder when I meet him. Tag, he nods his head and smiles vaguely. Herr Schroeder is our postman. Although I dont often speak to him, he is the only person I see every day.
Herr Schroeder collects stamps. Keep me any interesting ones, especially those new, Croatian, ones, he says. Just leave them for me on top of your postbox.
And I do, almost lovingly.

It is perhaps the obvious thing, to point to the materiality of the letter: how its written on paper, maybe folded and slid into a stamped envelope and sent par avion. But that materiality, in an era of email and text messages, has become the essential quality of the medium.
In The Work of Art in the Age of Mechanical Reproduction, Walter Benjamin considers how the modern capacity for reproduction affected original artworks, or rather, our (mediated) perception of those originals: Even in the most perfect reproduction, one thing is lacking: the here and now of the work of artits unique existence in a particular place. It is this unique existenceand nothing elsethat bears the mark of the history to which the work has been subject. It is hard to say what constitutes the original in email correspondence, which exists in multiple forms: in drafts, inboxes, and sent folders, ccd and bccd, so on and so forth. But the handwritten letter does have all the ingredients that make an original: a singular here and now, a unique existence in a particular place.
Letters on paper bear the mark of history. They show the trace of touch in fingerprints and coffee stains. And countless readings render scars in brittle paper, unfolded and folded up again.
Diminutive dimensions
I have a letter like that, from my 7th grade boyfriend. He wrote it out on a piece of lined and 3-hole punched notebook paper and folded it into a tiny square no larger than a quarter, so small that another fold would not have been possible. But despite these diminutive dimensions and the decades that divide the moment he wrote this epistle from our present, I still have this letter. Ive moved often in the years since receiptfrom Los Angeles to New York to Prague to Ann Arbor to Berlin to Austin and back to New Yorkand that little letter is not lost. Its folded corners are now nothing at all, just holes where the corners used to be. A few summers ago, newly thirty and moving again, I came across the letter and for the first time wondered about a white-out mark on the outside surface, hiding something from that younger me.
In that moment of consuming curiosity, I took a kitchen knife and scraped at that blotch of white-out, until I could make out what was written underneath: I [heart] U. At 30, I had the same reaction I imagine I would have had in the 7th grade were I so forensically inclined then. Really! I think. He loves me! Well, loved me. And maybe not really loved me. After all, he has drawn the symbol in lieu of the word, the (pre-Emoji era) universal middle school jargon for going steady, nothing more, nothing less. But still . . . it is somehow a flattering discovery. A moment of blushing transpires. I wonder whatever happened to Jesse Taylor. Rereading his letter, I am reminded that he was kind and funny, and the first in a string of boyfriends who could not spell to save his life. I patch together a few blurry memories of this person with whom I shared a brief past; I am lost in a cloud of nostalgia in my kitchen, knife in one hand, letter in the other.

Mahinda Rajapaksa leads MPs not attending parliamentary sittings: Muthuhettigama
Former President, Kurunegala MP Mahinda Rajapaksa has set up a record as the parliamentarian who has not attended parliamentary sittings the most number of times, Ports and Shipping Deputy Minister Nishantha Muthuhettigama said.
He was addressing a press conference at Galle on September 7.
He said it was not to join the Joint Opposition but to remain independent that he requested SLFPers to leave government ranks.
"They could not remain in the Government since fraud and corruption was rampant in it. When they try to highlight the corruptions, they were marginalised. That is why I talked less in parliament. There was nothing to praise in the Government," he said.
He said the opposition was performing its duties strongly while the Government was acting weakly. "They would request the President to direct powerful ministers to steer the country on the correct path at least now," he said.
He said Agriculture Minister and SLFP General Secretary Duminda Dissanayake held second with regard to absenteeism in parliament after Mahinda Rajapaksa. "I am the third]," Muthuhettigama said. He said he kept away from parliament because there was nothing to talk. He said he requested the President to establish a SLFP Government by 2020 rallying round disgruntled elements in the Joint Opposition.
"It would enable them to engage in lively debates and useful discussions in parliament," he said.

Messi hat-trick ensures Barca pounce on Madrid stumble
MADRID, Saturday  Lionel Messi's hat-trick saw Barcelona move four points clear of Real Madrid at the top of La Liga as Ousmane Dembele marked his debut with an assist in a 5-0 rout of local rivals Espanyol on Saturday.
Earlier, Madrid paid for the absence of the suspended Cristiano Ronaldo and a series of missed chances by Gareth Bale as they were held to a shock 1-1 home draw by newly-promoted Levante. Barca made no such mistake as for all their early season off-field problems, Ernesto Valverde's men have taken maximum points from their opening three La Liga games.
Messi led the way with a virtuoso performance, but his opener also needed a huge slice of luck as he was wrongly not flagged offside from Ivan Rakitic's through ball before blasting into the top corner. Barca's second arrived thanks to a counter-attack from an Espanyol corner led by Messi and Luis Suarez before Jordi Alba's low cross was slotted home at the near post by the Argentine.
It is a privilege to play with the best player in the world, said Suarez.
Game-by-game he keeps showing that Messi will be around for a long time to come.
Messi put the outcome beyond any doubt by rounding off his hat-trick with another sharp finish from Alba's cut-back.
Dembele has the unenviable task of replacing the departed Neymar and Barca's 105 million-euro man had to wait until 22 minutes from time for his debut as he replaced Gerard Deulofeu to a standing ovation. He showed why Barca have made the 20-year-old the third most expensive player ever as his pinpoint cross was swept home by Suarez to round off the scoring after Gerard Pique had headed home Barca's fourth.
However, even a fine display didn't dissuade the bad feeling towards Barca's under-fire board after a chaotic summer in the transfer market and splits between the boardroom and the dressing room, with Messi and Andres Iniesta yet to sign extensions to their contracts which expire in 2018.
Suarez's fifth goal was met with chants for president Josep Maria Bartomeu to reign.
At the Santiago Bernabeu, a much-changed Madrid paid a heavy price for a slow start as they dropped points at home for the second consecutive game.  AFP

Apartments priced around Rs. 25  35 milion, especially on the citys border, is in high demand, confirms one of Sri Lankas premier real estate developers and pioneer township developer, Millennium Housing Developers PLC.
Millennium Housing Developers PLC successfully diversified in to high rise projects last year, launching its first high rise apartment project, The Heights at Edmonton, at Edmonton Road, Kirulapone, quickly followed by The Heights at Nawala Road, Colombo 05.
Its latest at Rajagiriya Road, Rajagiriya, reflects the same concept of providing high standards of luxury and style to corporate sector executives and entrepreneurs as residences or as investments.
Attractively priced to offer affordable luxury, Green Heights at Rajagiriya is particularly noteworthy for its design, which matches the needs of corporate sector managers and entrepreneurs for a higher standard of style and elegance, practical convenience, recreational and sports facilities and low maintenance costs.
Millennium Housing Developers PLC has shown steady growth through this initiative.
Chairman's Review of 2013-14 predicted such a scenario. Despite this industrial set back experienced in 2013, the potential demand for affordable middle income housing continues to surge due to rapid urbanization, high price on renting or lease housing and decline in housing loan interest rates. Looking ahead, the government is focused on achieving a per capita of US$ 4,000 by 2016, highly encouraging for housing sector," it said.
We learned a lot about the needs of our target consumer before we launched our first city high rise project, The Heights at Edmonton Road Colombo 05. We gained more knowledge with The Heights @ Nawala Road. We can now say this project is more keenly attuned to our customers' genuine needs than ever before said MHD Chairman Harshith Dharmadasa.
The Heights at Nawala Road
A luxury apartment in the outskirts can give you better value in terms of living style and standards, simply because the developers outlay for land is lower here than in Colombo; customers get the convenience of Colombo, with a much shorter commute plus higher standard of luxury at a lower price, he said. Rajagiriya is one of the key areas in the Kotte city development plan 2008-2020.

Mohsin the star of South Asian derbies on World Final opening day
The spirit of bonhomie was strong between the Red Bull Campus Cricket representatives from Pakistan and India, whose match on the opening day of the World Final was marked by good feeling, before the players posed together for a photograph.
Jinnah Government College Nazimabad, Karachi (JGCN) cruised to a thumping seven-wicket victory over Marathwada Mitra Mandal College of Commerce, Pune (MMCC College)  and that match was reminiscent of the highest profile cricket match this year, the Champions Trophy final. Just as had been the case in London, Pakistan again skittled India for a low score, thanks in part to the bowling of Hasan Mohsin, who took 4 for 21 from 3.1 overs. He sent MMMC College hurtling to their eventual score of 81. They were all out in the 17 th over despite two straightforward catches going down. JGCN chased down the total with seven wickets spare.
In the other South Asian clash on day one, Sri Lankas college team remained ascendant over their Bangladesh counterparts, in what was a replay of last years Red Bull Campus Cricket title match. The winning margin on this occasion was a whopping 47 runs.
As had been the case in 2016, BMS were again substantially bolstered by the presence of an international-quality cricketer.
Amila Aponso, who had had an outstanding maiden series against Australia last year, claimed 3 wickets for 18 runs, in his teams defence of 188 for 7.
His opening over, which brought two wickets, cut short an impressive 57-run stand between ULAB openers Asir Intesar (16) and Jasim Uddin (32), was the turning point of the chase. The ULAB innings could not gain any momentum after that, and the team eventually limped to 141 for 7.
In the other two matches, Northwest University (NWU), South Africa suffocated the University of Sydney innings with their spin, while Herriott Watt University, UAE eased past World Final first-timers National University of Science and Technology (NUST), Zimbabwe.
For NWU offspinner Ruaan Haasbroek and legspinner Dyllan Matthews claimed three wickets apiece, scuttled the opposition innings after Sydney had made a rapid start. NWU eventually chased down the target of 158 in the 18th over, with six wickets to spare.
Spin-bowling was also crucial to Herriott Watts victory. Their legspinners Rahul Bhatia and Ronak Khandelwal took two wickets each as NUST stumbled to 96 all out  both those players also having played important roles with the bat, as Herriott Watt to propel Herriott Watt to 149 for 5.

NAB in parliament as private members bill
The JVP has decided to present the long overdue National Audit Bill (NAB) to Parliament as a private members bill.
JVP MP and COPE Chairman Sunil Handunnetti told the Daily News yesterday that he would present the Bill in the House within a month.
The National Audit Bill is a pre-election pledge of the Government that was even included in the 100-day work programme. The Governments waiting game has delayed the Bill for two and half years. This is a vital piece of legislation to curb public sector corruption. If the Government is dragging its feet, we in the JVP decided to come forward and present it to the House, Handunnetti said.
The MP said the JVP has constantly been in contact with the Auditor General and Audit Services Association over the developments with regard to the Bill. My private members bill will be the same legislation finalised by the Auditor General and approved by the Attorney General, he said.
The yahapalana Government says that it wants to nab thieves and arrest corruption. Yet they do not present the already finalised Bill designed to reduce corruption and mal-practices within the public sector, he said.
The first draft of the National Audit Bill was formulated in 2004 and it has been revised 22 times. The National Audit Commission, which has been set up following the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, has been inactive for two years due to absence of legal provisions.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, convening a special press conference last month, urged the Government to gazette the drafted National Audit Bill observing that the inordinate delay in passing the legislation has hampered work of his Department.
The latest draft of the Bill has tied all loose ends and got the Attorney Generals clearance. Yet the Government is bidding more time. We have been unable to introduce a service constitution and give regular promotions due to this delay. The approved cadre of AGs Department has 15 deputy AGs, but today we have only one, the Auditor General said.
The AG observed that several CAOs (Ministry Secretaries) have reportedly objected to the surcharge provision of the Bill. The powers for surcharge means a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he is held responsible.
MP Handunnetti said nobody but those who deliberately contravene the law to engage in corrupt acts objected to the clause.

In terms of value, LOLC & JKH led foreign purchases while Aitken Spence Holdings and Chevron led foreign sales.
Point of view
Markets responded positively followed by the new Inland Revenue Act passed on Thursday. GoSL, in line with its regional peers aims to reduce revenue contribution from Indirect taxes to 60% and increase revenues from direct taxation to 40% by 2020.
Notable concessions under new act include: Lowered corporate tax rate for SMEs & Exporters, Tax exemptions for investments in Northern Provinces and raising of tax threshold for employees & senior citizens.
In response to these policy directions ASPI recovered by 14.8 points on Friday, from the 20 week low 6,361.03 recorded on Wednesday.
Market sentiment meanwhile started to pick up as the weekly turnover levels stood at a 7 week high LKR 3.74Bn (15.4% W-o-W).
The turnovers were mainly buoyed by Crossings over the week, which accounted for ~61% of weeks LKR3.74Bn turnover, helping push weeks average daily turnover to LKR 0.94Bn - highest seen since Jun17.
Crossings over the week were primarily driven by TKYO - accounting for 28% of total market turnover (46% of weeks crossings) and SOY - accounting for 17% of total market (27% of total crossings).
Significant interest in counters i.e. JKH, SPEN and SAMP further helped drive the rebound in turnover.
The week meanwhile ended with a net foreign buying position of LKR 247.65Mn in contrast to last weeks net foreign selling position of LKR 434.02Mn.
LOLC, JKH & TKYO topped weeks foreign purchases list, helping the turnaround in net position while recovering from over 4 month low foreign buying.
Following the sanction of Inland Revenue Bill on Thursday, market has gradually edged up on Friday and we expect this sentiment to prevail over the next week.
GoSL outlines economic vision
In its 2025 Vision statement the GoSL stated that it plans to base growth on a social market economy while seeking to foster innovation and entrepreneurship to facilitate skill-based technological change as a driver of productivity and economic growth.
The GoSL added that it would do so through the provision of an appropriate incentive regime for a private investment led and export-driven growth model to leverage Sri Lankas advantages as a trade and services hub.
The vision statement further noted that the economy can no longer depend on a public investment-led and infrastructure-driven growth process and that the high levels of public debt, a rapidly diminishing export share of GDP and an ageing population underscore the need for a transformative reform process.
The reform initiatives will address the policies, the state of markets, the role of Government, and regulatory institutions that determine long-term growth dynamics.
The GoSL further noted that since a strong and stable macroeconomic foundation lays the basis for a broader reform effort, a better mix of fiscal consolidation efforts, coupled with prudent monetary and exchange rate policy reforms will lay the basis for deeper reforms pertaining to trade and investment as well as factor market constraints in land, labour and capital that impede growth.
The vision statement also noted that the GoSL would provide economic security to the less well-off through stronger social safety nets to mitigate their vulnerability to shocks.

One of a kind lavender labyrinth
If youve ever fantasized about wandering down an endless, winding road of sweet-smelling flowers, a farm on Lake Michigan can help make your dreams come true.
Cherry Point Farm and Market in Shelby, Michigan is home to a lot of fanciful (mostly edible) things, like cherries, pies, breads, jams, fudge, and even summer fish boils. The fruit and farm market has been in operation since 1961 and is currently run by the fourth generation of the founding family. As if a homegrown roadside cherry shop wasnt meditative enough, in 2001, owner Barbara Bull started work on a lavender labyrinth, which is now a popular attraction thats large enough to be seen on Google Earth.
With the help of artist and architect Conrad Heiderer, Bull designed an asymmetrical flower maze with an herb garden at its center. It takes about an hour to walk to the center on one long, meandering route.
Walking into the labyrinth is only half the journey, Bull told MLive. You need to walk out again.
While it might be too late for the primary flower season - the labyrinths French lavender peaks in the springtime - it continues to bloom throughout the summer, and then dries up at the end of fall when its collected. The space is also home to other seasonal flora like apple, peach, and cherry trees - which are ready for harvest in the autumn - and all kinds of plants that are endemic to the area, like black-eyed Susans and wild hollyhocks.
A journey into the labyrinth is free and doesnt require reservations, so you can drop in and take a walk among the flowers anytime you like. Natural Blaze

Poisoning of ex-LTTE cadres; a canard: Sathyalingam
Former Northern Province Health Minister P. Sathyalingam said there was no truth to speculation that some ex-LTTE cadres at rehabilitation centres were injected with poison leading to their deaths.
When questioned by a fellow member of the Northern PC on Thursday about the outcome of an investigation carried out by a special team appointed during Sathyalingams time as health minister of the NCP, the former minister had replied that the special team had concluded their probe and they had found out the allegations were completely false.
Earlier media reports citing certain Tamil politicians in the north alleged that some LTTE cadres at rehabilitation centres were injected with poison leading to their deaths.
The government has vehemently rejected these claims vehemently, with Defence State Minister Ruwan Wijewardene rejecting them as false and baseless allegations. Sathyalingam had said that the team had examined a large number of ex-LTTE cadres who were rehabilitated at the government run centres and they had not found a single instance of poison being used on them.

President Sirisena opens 250th RO water purification plant in Horowpathana

President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday ceremonially declared open the 250th Reverse Osmosis (RO) unit at the Morakewa Sri Saddarmajothikarama temple premises at Ritigahawewa, Horowpathana.
The Presidential Task Force on the Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease (CKDu) and the Sri Lanka Navy have been engaged in this initiative since December 2015, in keeping with the President's vision 'Wellbeing for All' as asserted in his policy statement under 'Maithri Palanayak- Sthavara Ratak'.
Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake, Rural Economic Affairs Minister P. Harrison, Chief of Defence Staff, Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne and the Commander of the Navy Vice Admiral Travis Sinniah were among the dignitaries present at the occasion.
Coinciding with the main event, the President also bestowed 10 more RO plants for the public in the Anuradhapura district through an online virtual portal.
Installation of RO plants in areas that are prone to the kidney disease is one of the many projects undertaken by the Sri Lanka Navy. The project was initially funded by the contributions from the Naval personnel.
The RO plants are produced by the Navy's Research and Development Unit. With funding from the Presidential Task Force on Prevention of Chronic Kidney Disease the Navy has installed a large number of RO plants in many parts of the island.
Thus far, 250 RO plants have been installed across the country to date, facilitating over 119,214 families and 81,690 school children with safe drinking water.
Sri Lanka Navy's initiative in providing water treatment plants (Reverse Osmosis) to areas that are most prone to Chromic Kidney Disease (CKD) has earned special recognition at an awards ceremony organized by the Japan Sri Lanka Technical & Cultural Association (JESTECA).

Priorities gone off course
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has announced a joint island-wide strike in the next few days if the Government fails to offer an effective solution to the SAITM issue. This is high time for the Anti-SAITM Peoples Barricade to have this strike as this chaos was initiated by the previous regime in 2008. Where were these so-called Anti-SAITM Barricade at the time of its inception
It bears testimony to the old proverb that someone with eyesight lost is trying to worship the sun. They should have nipped in the bud but now it has grown beyond any repair. Having lost all the opportunities, they are now pressurising the government to give them a sustainable solution. We also learned that the deans of the eight medical faculties have submitted a set of proposals spelling out how to resolve the SAITM issue. The SAITM was set up after the SLMC came to an agreement. A private institute could be established under the provisions of UGC Act, according to the agreement.
The GMOA, the SLMC, the university students as well as the Anti-SAITM Peoples Barricade such as the Inter-Company Employees Union, the Ceylon Teachers Services Union and the Government Indigenous Medicine Officers Association have threatened the government that they would commence an anti-SAITM vehicle parade on September 12. Touring around the country on September 12, 13 and 14, the parade will reach Colombo on September 15. Then the entire city of Colombo will be disturbed with all its activities coming to a halt.
Traffic congestion
This cannot be the ideal solution. The traffic congestion and all that will affect the innocent public. In fact, this is a deal between the GMOA and the government. If that is the case, why avenge the innocent public The innocent public, of course, undergo untold hardships and face unnecessary inconvenience. In the past, the general public could not protest against the government. That is possible today thanks to the good governance. We enjoy the freedom of expression. As a result, most protesters express their grievances to the government in the form of strike or protest.
An ideal solution rests elsewhere. The committee solution is still pending. They are yet to formulate an optimistic solution. Until then, why not stay put a little Why not hold on the parade
The GMOA and the medical faculty students have been leading this protest against the SAITM for a quite long period. The whole period has elapsed with no sustainable solution. What has happened in reality is that the students missed their lessons. The completion of their degree will keep on being postponed.
Their parents would naturally wonder as to how long these protests would go on. They have every reason for that worry as the guardians.
On a different note, some female medical undergraduates have expressed their concern about the protest in an interview with the Daily News. They are quite uncertain about their future with an ongoing protest. Unlike the males, the females have an added burden to worry about: the age factor. The longer the protest goes on, the more added their burden will be with an incomplete degree.
Unsolved issues
That is no joke, of course. The cream of the young blood wastes their precious time on the streets. That is exactly why the government should be more serious about this issue. The government must take necessary steps to solve the unsolved issues. The university lecturers have an important role to play as well. Without misleading, the much-respected academics must try their level best to convince them why they should call it a day and focus seriously on the studies.
On the other hand, thousands of students at the SAITM are earnestly waiting for a favourable solution. This protest is at a total loss for the government, medical faculty students as well as the SAITM students.
The relevant authorities should bring up a permanent solution to this long-pending issue. The students can then rest assured and reach their goals: completing the degree on time.

Questions and Answers
Legal Provisions related to working hours and holidays
Question
I am working in the private sector. Please let me know what are the laws in Sri Lanka relating to working hours and holidays and the applicability of those laws for different working groups in the country
Herath - Gampola
Answer
There are three laws that set the working hours, rest intervals and different types of holidays. These are:
Wages Board Ordinance of 1941
Shop and Office Employees Act of 1954
Factories Ordinance of 1950
The Factories Ordinance applies to any establishment engaged in:
 A manufacturing process
 Charitable or reformatory work
 Technical or vocational training, where any manual labour is exercised such as making, altering, and repairing, ornamenting, finishing, washing, cleaning, or adapting for sale.
Even if these premises do not constitute a factory, the provisions of the Factories Ordinance will apply.
The Shop and Office Employees Act is applicable to all employees working in a shop or an office.
The Wages Board Ordinance will apply to all trades listed under the Ordinance.
Providing a Medical Certificate for sick leave
Question
I am working in a well-known firm as a senior officer. I had a bad cold one day and was at home after taking painkillers. I went to work next day and gave the medical leave form to one of the officers. I was told that I had to submit my medical certificate even for one day. Please let me know about the following:
Is it necessary to submit a medical certificate from a doctor even for one day
For how many days do we need a medical certificate 
According to the Shop and Office Act regulations, how many days do we get for annual, casual and medical leave per year
Shivantha Vivekananda
- Bambalapitiya
Answer
If you have become sick unexpectedly, then you have to inform your office at least over the phone. If you have taken sick leave suddenly without informing your office, then you have to submit a medical certificate if they are requesting. Submission of medical certificates depends on the practice of your working place. In some working places, they require medical certificates after the second day of sick leave.
Under the Shop and Office Act, an employee is entitled to take annual leave when the next calendar year starts. The duration of that first annual leave period is determined according to the date/month on which the employment commenced. From the second year onwards, an employee is entitled to 14 days of paid annual leave, after completion of 12 months of continuous service.
For the first year, an employee would have following annual leave, depending upon the time of commencement of his employment:
- 14 days if the employment commences on or after January 1, but before April 1;
- 10 days if the employment commences on or after April 1, but before July 1;
- Seven days if the employment commences on or after July 1, but before October 1
- Four days if the employment commences on or after October 1.
A worker is required to take his annual leave within twelve months of its entitlement. The annual leave schedule is determined by the mutual agreement between the employer and the employee. It may be split, however, its minimum duration cannot be less than seven days. Employers are not allowed to compel workers to work during annual leave. If the employment contract expires before a worker could acquire the right to annual leave, the employee is entitled to the annual leave earned by him or her in respect of the previous year plus the days earned during the year of termination.
In accordance with the Shop and Office Act, every worker certified by a medical practitioner is entitled to a paid sick leave (sickness benefit) for a period of seven days (in a 12 month period) for private business due to ill-health or any other reasonable cause. These are generally known as casual leave. Casual leave is normally availed from one-half day to one or more days at a time. This does not include a case of prolonged ill health.
Claiming ownership of a property
Question
We have been living in our house for the past 43 years, during the lifetime of our mother. Our mother was paying the asst. to the C.M.C. and upon her death in the years 1992, we continued to pay asst. rates to date. Having obtained a deed after testamentary proceeding from D.C. Colombo, it continued to be an uninterrupted an undisturbed possession.
A person came with a deed registered at the land register Colombo in the years 1955 claiming a  share of the property where we live. He came twice after requesting for the purported share. Having had no knowledge of this claim, we refused his purported claim.
Are there any terms in law to refute his purported claims
S. Pakeer  Colombo 2
Answer
As you have mentioned, there was a Testamentary Case regarding your property. Usually in testamentary cases, it is a requirement to publish a newspaper notice in three languages informing all the claimants about the Case. The said person who is claiming rights to your property should come to Court during the testamentary case. However, if there is a dispute with regard to ownership of the said property, the party who is claiming the rights to your property can go to Courts and prove his ownership.
Maternity Leave of Government Employee
Question
I am working in a government department. I delivered a baby at the time of accepting a permanent appointment in my department. Am I entitled to maternity leave
Thusitha - Wellampitiya
Answer
According to the provisions of Public Administration Circular No. 4/2005 dated 03.02.2005, you are entitled to maternity leave. Maternity leave with full pay, leave with half pay and leave with no pay can be granted as per the provisions of the circular deducting the period from the delivery up to the date of accepting the permanent appointment.
Legality of Homosexuality
Question
Please let me know whether homosexuality is criminalized in Sri Lanka. If so, what are the legal provisions applicable
Daily News Reader
Answer
According to section 356 of Penal Code Sri Lanka it says whoever voluntarily has carnal intercourse against the order of nature with any man, woman, or animal, shall be punished with imprisonment of either description for a term which may extend to ten years and shall also be punished with fine and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for injuries caused to such person.
Furthermore. section 365(a) says any person who, in public or private, commits, or is a party to the commission of, or procures or attempts to procure the commission by any person of, any act of gross indecency with another person, shall be guilty of an offence, and shall be punished with imprisonment of either the description for a term which may extend to two years or with fine or with both and where the offence is committed by a person over eighteen years of age in respect of any person under sixteen years of age shall be punished with rigorous imprisonment for a term not less than ten years and not exceeding twenty years and with fine and shall also be ordered to pay compensation of an amount determined by court to the person in respect of whom the offence was committed for the injuries caused to such person
Therefore, homosexuality can be considered as a criminalized offences. However, the practical situation is that the Police dont file many cases under those provisions.

## Title: Radicalization; a prevailing puzzle

Radicalization; a prevailing puzzle
On a random day in January 2015, Mohamed Muhsin Sharhaz Nilam, 37, of Galewala, packed his bags, and with his family of wife and six children in tow, left his quiet life as a principal of an international school to join the most violent terrorist organization in the world today. His mission: to fight alongside ISIS to create an Islamic Caliphate in the region. He was killed in an air strike on 12 July 2015.
Since then, the former Secretary Defence Karunasena Hettiarachchi as well as the former Minister of Justice Wijeyadasa Rajapaksha has stated that around 36 Sri Lankans have left the island nation to join ISIS. Minister Rajapaksha explained these individuals came from educated backgrounds.
The reason as to why these individuals, far from the conflict of Syria would leave their comfortable lives to fight for a cause alien to them, however remains a mystery.
Two years later, former Canadian Intelligence Officer Phil Gurski addressing a room full of defence personnel interested in knowing the root causes of such radicalization said, There is no formula for why someone would radicalize.
The Defence establishment in this years Colombo Defence Seminar held chose to look at one of the most important security threats the world has in common; Countering Violent Extremism.
The present CEO and President of Borealis Threat and Risk Consulting Ltd had been invited to speak on the definition and root causes of radicalization and yet to a surprised room, he announced that it was highly impossible to come up with a generalized and universal template as there was too much variability when one needs to define or identify why a rational person would take to arms.
Radicalization in its essence is not a problem he continued. Some of the greatest progresses came from radical people, he added but a problem arises when that radicalization is imposed on others with violent means.
A person who radicalizes, says, there is something wrong here, I know who is behind it and I need to use violence to make it right, explained Gurski further.
You bring enough people who think this way, and you have a terrorist outfit.
The essence of terrorism is a group of people who think they have a grievance, they think they there is an injustice, they know who is responsibleeither it is the state or those people. And the only way to get justice is to use violence, said Gurski.
This definition alone however does not answer the question of which persons exactly will take to arms or radicalize to the detriment of others. The usual root causes of; poverty, lack of education, lack of opportunity, isolation and even mental illness (long ruled out), is too simplistic said Gurski. In addition, the theory that only failed states or ungoverned spaces tend to produce terrorists does not answer as to why even developed countries like Canada or the USA too have their own home grown terrorists.
Each element, each driving force proposed is neither necessary nor sufficient to cause terrorism, said Gurski.
Each persons individual process to violent radicalization is individual, he added as he explained that in his long career as an intelligence officer, there were men and women who were both, rich and poor, educated and uneducated, loners as well as with familyall from varied backgrounds but they had all chosen to radicalize for one purpose or the other.
Thus he asked that experts not confuse the important distinction of correlation and causation when designing policies to root out terrorists.
When mapping, we need to consider local and individual differences and if you generalize, you will end up with bad policies that will not address the issue, said Gurski.
In the local context, Gurski explained that a Canadian study done on the motivation of young men in the North to join the LTTE showed that becoming a violent terrorist was a rational decision made from their perspective. They were not brainwashed. The cause for joining the movement according them was for a certain search for significance in their lives.
Gurski however pointed out that such conclusions were problematic; All want to be significant and want meaning in their livesall humans have that, which would mean that all could potentially be a terrorist given the right condition, he pointed out.
Gurski also went onto dismiss theories of self-radicalization. He said, in his career he has never seen any case of self-radicalization.
It is a human-to-human process. We are social animals, we talk to people, in life or online. You have to get input from somebody else, you have questions and doubts and they get solved for you by somebody, he said.
This has been the case for those like Nilam who is known to have studied in Pakistan and visited Saudi Arabia a couple of times. His own brother, Mohamed Aroos, had been working in Syria for four years and has also been suspected to be part of ISIS, though it is yet to be confirmed.
Sri Lankan Muslim identity in flu
According to an article written by Balasubramaniyan Viswanathan in Geopolitics Monitor; an International Intelligence Publication based in Canada, external influences as well as deep schisms among various sub-groups within the Sri Lankan Muslim community which not only posed questions on the Muslim identity in Sri Lanka, but also of its ideology may have created a perfect ecosystem for radicalization of youngsters. According to a recent study commissioned by the International Centre for Ethnic Studies in Sri Lanka, entitled Fracturing CommunityIntra-group relations among the Muslims of Sri Lanka, factionalism among the Muslims is driven by both material gains as well as the desire to protect their own version of Islam, Viswanathan explained in his article.
Traditional Islamist movements like Sufism are in direct conflict with reformist movements like Jamaat e Islami and Thablighi Jamaat. In Sri Lanka, it appears that Pakistan based Jamaat e Islami and India based Thablighi Jamaat have toned down their ideology for formation of hard line Islamic State and have focused on local issues while preaching purification of Islamic practices. However, this conflict soon aggravated when Saudi Arabia-based movements like the Thawheed Jamaat jumped into the fray. Thawheed Jamaat preached Wahabism, a more radical form of Islam propagated by Abdul Wahab which in turn created a conflict between two primary schools of thoughtWahabism and Sufism in Sri Lanka.
Though the ICES study concludes from interviews with interlocutors of various groups like Thawheed, Thablighi, and Sufi, that there are no Islamic jihadist groups operating in Sri Lanka at this moment, it does concede that while there is talk among discontented youth about espousing jihadi practices, these are just idle youth responding to the global trend in Islam, but with no motivation or the means to make this a reality, he added.
And this misinterpretation of religion leading to violence, has been termed as a mixture of the religious and radical wave of terrorism in the 21st century by Prof Lailufar Yasmin of the Department of International Relations at the University of Dhaka.
Prof. Yasmin, also addressing the Colombo Defence Seminar, explained that when countering violent extremism, one needed to look at the religious wave and radical wave together.
It is where I do not only kill to please God, but I murder anyone who does not believe in my ideology; my kind of Islam. Here, we also have distorted Quranic messages coming in, she said.
Countering violent extremism
Citing an example from Bangladesh, she explained that in Janurary, 2016, they found that changed Quranic verses were being presented to youth to motivate them to carry out violence. She further explained that such threats cannot be fought by the security sector alone but it needed to be looked at from the macro, micro and meso levels.
At the micro level, the individual is important, Each terrorist narrative is different: the role of the imam, educational institution, etc. needs to be looked into, said the Professor. At the meso level, the trend of religious conservatism or radicalism in society in general needs to be studied, she explained further. Action needs to be taken at the tertiary level, after they are radicalized; secondary, when they are showing symptoms and primary, even before they are radicalized, to identify those who are at risk, said Prof. Yasmin.
This system was adopted in Indonesia which has been working on countering violent extremism since the Bali bombings in 2002. As explained by Prof. Yasmin, they had programmes in prison to build trust between police and prison officials with terrorists in custody to either de-radicalize them or to find out more information on their outfits. These programmes also seek to manage violent extremism in prison environments and develop the role of frontline prison staff in countering violent extremism.
The lead national counter-terrorism agency in Indonesia, Badan Nasional Penanggulangan Terrorisme (BNPT), was established in 2010 to coordinate all stakeholders involved in countering violent extremism. But managing the diverse views within Indonesia has been difficult and bringing all state agencies onto the same page has been an obstacle.
Prof. Yasmin, however, pointed out that civil society groups have been more successful in their efforts and programmes such as having former militants and victims speak at forums has had some success.
Inter-faith debate, use of social media; though follow up with personal face-to-face contact is crucial, are some of the other activities taken up by the relevant stakeholders to prevent youth radicalizing.
National education policy
Another perspective promoted by Sabariah Binte Mohamed Hussin, Research Analyst at the International Centre for Political Violence and Terrorism Research at the S. Rajarathnam School of International Studies in Singapore, was to promote a national education policy where all linguistic and ethnic groups would study together from kindergarten until they complete their tertiary education in order to build a common national identity. Speaking from the Singapore example, she explained that if diverse communities go to school in their own linguistic and religious denominations, then a nation would never be united. No multi religious/ethnic society can sustain security and stability if they grow up in silos and dont assimilate and integrate in creating the nation state, said Hussin.
Communities in isolation, she said, will bound to create prejudice, suspicion and violence unless there assimilation of the communities at some point. The importance of having all communities study all religions was also highlighted here.
Such policies in national education requires leadership and political will, she said and added that the need to inculcate national consciousness and patriotism was vital for security and nation building.
Exclusiveness will not only lead to ethnic differences but also to violent extremism. In Singapore, no community insisted that its language and race be above othersit has to be neutral and secular so all can feel at home, she said.
Singapore also practices policies where housing, common spaces and other amenities are designed to have all ethnic communities live together, side by side. The national service made mandatory to all male Singaporeans is also thought to build cohesiveness among all Singaporean men.
The country, Hussin pointed out also practiced, the policy of Total Defence where all citizens play their part to keep an eye out for extremist behavior and do their part to keep the country secure. Sri Lanka, with its multi-lingual and multi-ethnic communities, however, has been more than happy over the years to live in silos rather than integrate. The isolation felt by one led to a three decade war. As the threat of radicalism spreads across the world, Gurski pointed out that the best way to counter violent extremism was through dialogue, but he pointed out, As intelligence services, we dont do a great job in participating in the dialogue.

SACOSAN 10th Inter-Country Working Group meeting
Sanitation has become the most challenging social service priority in the South Asian Region. Globally, one in three household lack proper sanitation as reported in the final assessment of MDG Goal 7 target 7.8 evaluation.
In 2003, South Asian countries met in Dhaka, Bangladesh, for the first ever major conference on sanitation. The South Asian Conference on Sanitation (SACOSAN) is viewed as a great opportunity to inspire grass root level activists and to mobilize political will in narrowing the sanitation gap in the region.
SACOSANs influence has spread to the other regions in the world and as a result, similar movements have been established such as EASAN for East Asia, AFRICASAN for Africa and LATINOSAN for the South America.
In addition, Pakistan, India and Bangladesh conduct their own national conferences for sanitation namely PAKOSAN, INDOSAN and BANGLASAN, so SAN is a well-known brand name in the region to promote the importance of sanitation through mobilizing commitment of stakeholders including the government, political, civil society private sectors and donors.
SACOSAN collaborates with SAARC countries to accelerate progress in ensuring access to adequate sanitation in the region. SACOSAN started in 2003 with the realization that a large number of un-served people lacking proper sanitation are living in South Asia.
At the first SACOSAN held in 2003 in Bangladesh, SACOSAN was declared to be introduced to SAARC countries in the South Asian region as a process in order to review progress achieved in the sanitation sector in each country.
With the realization that there was a large number of un-served people living in South Asia, SACOSAN used as the platform for resolving regional sanitation issues. This is a biennial, government-led process and is attended by relevant ministries of the governments of South Asia.
The conferences have been able to mobilize political will, donor support and commitment of all stakeholders in mobilizing resources to address one of the pressing issues of South Asia.
SACOSANs have been a great platform for governments, regional partners, support agencies, practitioners and professional agencies to engage in constructive dialogue and in agreeing commitments and collective effort to foster regional collaboration in pursuit of meeting the sanitation challenge in the region.
The outcomes of much significance from these conferences have been recommendations emerging from the deliberations which were then embodied in Ministerial Declarations to add the weight required for political commitment and action for moving ahead.
The overall goal of the SACOSAN process is to accelerate the progress of sanitation and hygiene work in South Asia so as to enhance its peoples quality of life in fulfillment of the Millennium Development Goals and the commitments made in the World Summit on Sustainable Development Objectives.
SACOSANS objectives are to review the progress made in implementation of the Delhi Declaration of the 3rd South Asian Conference on Sanitation (held in 2008 in India), to reiterate political commitment in each country of the region for furthering the sanitation agenda, to facilitate development of country-specific as well as regional frameworks for sanitation, to share experiences and lessons learnt in sanitation and hygiene promotion and to increase the outreach of sanitation agenda in the region.
After the 4th SACOAN held in in Colombo, Sri Lanka has been able to give a new impetus to the SACOSAN process by adopting a Terms of Reference for the Inter-Country Working Group (ICWG) represented by Country Focal Points of the eight countries of the region.
Sri Lanka received further recognition at the 5th SACOSAN hosted by Nepal in 2013 as heads of country delegation who signed the Kathmandu Declaration said they welcomed the offer of Sri Lanka to host the SACOSAN Secretariat and act as a resource, knowledge and learning centre on sanitation and hygiene facilitating coordination and capacity development in South Asia.
Establishment of the South Asia Regional Center for Sanitation was reaffirmed by the the ministerial declaration at the 6th SACOSAN held in Bangladesh in 2016 and a commitment was made to promote continual learning and sharing of experiences and innovations between and within countries by various mechanisms including a functional and dynamic SACOSAN Secretariat in Sri Lanka by 2018 and an ICWG with an expanded role to enhance knowledge exchange and learning between meetings, relevant research and development, appropriate use of information technology and traditional and new forms of media.
This center will provide the platform for Sri Lankan professionals to engage with their regional partners to improve sanitation and thereby enhance the quality of life of the people in the region as a whole and share across other regions.
As a result, the Cabinet of ministers approved the proposal by the Ministry of City Planning and Water Supply to establish The South Asia Regional Centre for Sanitation under the SACOSAN banner to extend regional cooperation amongst SAARC countries and to honour the trust placed upon the Ministry of CP and WS by the regional partners.
Key functions to be performed by the centre are to act as the secretariat for the ICWG, knowledge management and networking across all SANs, Secretariat to support the framework of sanitation for SAARC. In addition, a more ambitious long-term vision is to develop a faculty of excellence in promoting safely managed sanitation across the region to meet sustainable development goals.

Singapore economists expect manufacturing to keep soaring
Singapore's manufacturing sector is expected to keep soaring on the back of an upturn in global trade, a new survey of private-sector economists has found.
However, sectors dependent on spending by Singapore consumers and businesses are likely to continue lagging behind, according to those polled in the survey conducted by the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS).
Still, the economists said tentative signs are emerging that strong trade-driven growth is rubbing off on the wider economy.
The economists polled in the MAS latest quarterly survey expect the local economy to grow 2.5 per cent this year, unchanged from estimates in the previous quarter's survey.
The MAS survey reflects the views of 21 analysts who monitor the Singapore economy.
Their estimates come after the Government last month narrowed its forecast for economic growth this year to 2 per cent to 3 per cent, from an earlier estimate of 1 per cent to 3 per cent. Official forecasts tip full-year growth of about 2.5 per cent
While this is more robust than last year's 2 per cent expansion, it masks uneven performances across various sectors of the economy.
Respondents in the MAS latest poll expect the manufacturing sector to charge ahead by 6.6 per cent this year, up from an estimate of 5 per cent in June's survey.
Manufacturing - making up a fifth of the economy and a key growth driver this year - is being lifted by strong global demand for semiconductors and related equipment.
The finance and insurance sector is also expected to pick up pace, with economists in the latest poll forecasting 2.9 per cent growth, up from 1.9 per cent in the previous survey.
However, other sectors are doing less well.
The outlook for the construction sector has taken a sharp turn for the worse, going by the latest survey, with respondents tipping a contraction of 4.2 per cent. The previous survey, released in June, flagged 0.2 per cent growth in the sector.
The outlook for the accommodation and food services sector also worsened - it is now expected to shrink 1.5 per cent, from previous estimates of a 1 per cent expansion.
Economists polled expect overall economic growth of 2.5 per cent next year, the same pace as this year.
CIMB Private Bank economist Song Seng Wun said the poll results reflect still-uneven growth across the economy. We expect strong third-quarter numbers on the back of stronger exports and manufacturing, but the pickup is still very much trade driven. Straits Times

The board is now not only widely believed to be detrimental to the development of cricket, it is also seen as one of the most toxic governing bodies in the country.
Whether these former players are willing to become associated with SLC given its present state remains to be seen.
But as far as some board officials are concerned, they have several vacancies to fill, and would like for these men to be installed in those positions.
De Silva, for example, would return to his role as cricket advisor, some board officials hope. They would also like Mahanama, Kuruppu and Labrooy to become selectors, to replace the Sanath Jayasuriya-led committee thatresignedearlier in the month. Ideally Jayawardene might also come in as a consultant. And the only reason officials have not set their sights on Kumar Sangakkara is because he is still playing cricket overseas.
Of these ex-players, Labrooy and Kuruppu have confirmed that SLC has approached them, while Mahanama has said he has not been approached so far. Labrooy is currently an ICC match referee.
There is some irony in the board gunning for the aid of these former players at this juncture, because some of them are the same men it has spent the last 18 months alienating. Kuruppu was part of the selection committee that was sacked by Thilanga Sumathipala and the board just 48 hours from the team's scheduled departure from the 2016 World T20, for example.
Jayawardene's plan to take cricket into the provinces was scrapped and criticised, and he was ousted from his position in the SLC cricket committee. De Silva had held the cricket advisor post for about 12 months, but thenquit earlier this year, due to strong differences with SLC.
Two developments have precipitated this drastic change of approach. In the wake of the 0-9 drubbing by India, and indeed the unprecedented losses to Bangladesh and Zimbabwe earlier this year, members of SLC's executive committee have become convinced that the board's existing trajectory was untenable. Those defeats have also substantially weakened Thilanga Sumathipala's political grip within the organisation, with pressure now having been placed on him from higher political offices in the country.
Sports minister Dayasiri Jayasekara has repeatedly said that he would not dissolve an elected board to appoint an interim committee, so the Sumathipala presidency is safe for now - at least until the board elections early next year (they could be brought forward to December).
However, other board officials have now taken strong issue with the manner in which Sumathipala has conducted business at SLC, particularly his alleged meddling with team selection and direct influence over cricket matters. These agitating officials claim that should any of the former players they are trying to woo take up positions at the board, those new appointments should "have a free hand", in contrast to what had previously been the case. It is perhaps relevant thatGraham Ford resignedin June exactly because he felt his role was repeatedly encroached upon.
The sports minister is also hoping to get many of these former players together for a brainstorming session on how SLC might turn cricket around, over the next week or so.
Essentially, amid a significant decline in influence for Sumathipala, there is now substantial will within SLC to change tack. Early indications from the former players they are chasing, however, is that they would rather await fundamental change in SLC - either the election or the appointment of a fresh board - before they become involved.

SLITHM leads effort to upgrade tourism services
The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) is to conduct a series of tourism related training programmes for industry stakeholders.
The aim of the programme which is being conducted under the auspices of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs is to uplift the standards of tourism services across the country.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga, who has been the driving force behind the initiative, is of the view that Sri Lanka must focus on improving its tourism service delivery in order to be competitive in attracting high spenders.
Im pleased to see SLITHM taking the lead role in this endeavour and I hope that the private sector will take a cue from this and initiate training programmes of their own to cater to the segments that may be outside the scope of the SLITHM programmes, the Minister said.
A newly formed Tourism Event Management Unit of SLITHM has been tasked with formulating and conducting the training programmes which will essentially target entrepreneurs and service providers associated with the tourism industry.
A section of the participants at the training programme
The first such programme titled Health and wellness tourism business, development and training opportunities for stakeholders was held on September 6 at the SLITHM Auditorium in Colombo.
The programme is in line with the Tourism Ministrys wider national objective of providing a range of training opportunities for industry stakeholders to grow their tourism-related businesses through better operational knowledge, skills and competencies, said SLITHM Chairman Sunil Dissanayake.It is important to provide tourism-related professional education with a certification. Health and wellness is a key area that lacks professional education. We need to provide them with training beyond the technicalities in ayurvedic spa treatments.
Dissanayake said the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) was in the process of introducing new regulations to standardize the health and wellness sector.
These regulations are not to control but to standardize services and ensure better facilities, said Dissanayake.

As an initial step SLITHM has identified ten different training areas in collaboration with the industry, academia and regulatory bodies. They include: Health and Wellness Tourism, Adventure Tourism, Spiritual and Religious Tourism, Wildlife and Nature Tourism, Recreational Tourism, Archeology and Research, Community Tourism, Eco Tourism, Home Stay, Village Stay and Farm Stay Tourism.
The programme content and resource persons will be sourced through joint collaboration of the SLITHM, industry professionals, academia and relevant regulatory bodies.
The main objectives of the training programmes are to provide an opportunity for industry stakeholders to be updated on latest trends, knowledge and practices, to facilitate a dialogue between academic expertise and industry stakeholders and to reduce the knowledge gap of existing tourism service providers. Participants will be issued a certificate at the conclusion of the programmes.

Somerset seal important win over Warwicks
LONDON, Friday - Somerset kept their Division One survival hopes alive, while piling more pressure on bottom side, with a 169-run victory at Edgbaston.
Warwickshire began the final day on 172-6, still needing 230 runs for an unlikely win with only four wickets remaining.
After rain had delayed the start Tim Groenewald (5-58) completed his five-wicket haul to leave Warwickshire 232 all out and 30 points adrift.
Ashley Giles Warwickshire, who won the County Championship title as recently as 2012, are now likely to need at least two wins from their final three fixtures, one of which is against sixth-placed Yorkshire.
The match between Championship title challengers Lancashire and Essex at Old Trafford ended as a draw, with further rain affecting the game on day four. There was little prospect of a positive result once Essex, who began 115-4, reached 141 to avoid the follow-on.
The visitors declared on 202-8 to deny Lancashire the chance of a third bowling bonus point, meaning both teams took nine points from the match. Essex remain 36 points clear at the top of Division One with three games left.
Both sides start the first of their remaining matches on Tuesday, with Essex facing bottom club Warwickshire and Lancashire taking on Somerset.
Essex could clinch their first Championship title since 1992 if they win at Edgbaston, but are reliant on Lancashire slipping up at Taunton.
Ben Foakes and Ollie Pope put on a partnership of 158 to help Surrey draw with Hampshire at the Ageas Bowl. Having begun on 135-4, Foakes (83 not out) and Pope (100 not out) batted for the whole of day four before the captains shook hands.
Hampshire are third on 127 points, with Surrey three points behind in fourth.
Yorkshire and Middlesex had to settle for a draw after four rain-affected days in their County Championship game.
Middlesex were 108-3 after rain washed out the morning's play, before Yorkshire seamer Liam Plunkett struck twice to leave them 143-5. Adam Voges 58 helped them earn a second batting bonus point as they declared on 272-8.
Yorkshire are 13 points clear of the relegation zone in fifth, level on points with sixth-placed Middlesex.
Worcestershire took a big step towards Division Two promotion and ended Nottinghamshire's unbeaten record with an eight-wicket win at Trent Bridge. The visitors began day four on 123-2, needing another 103 for victory.
Opener Daryl Mitchell, on 63 overnight, reached his sixth County Championship hundred of the season and finished unbeaten on 139 to take Worcestershire to 229-2 before lunch. One win from Worcestershire's final two matches should seal promotion.
Graham Onions became Durham's all-time leading first-class wicket-taker but Sam Billings batted with a migraine to help Kent to a thrilling draw.
Seamer Onions took his 519th wicket to surpass Simon Brown's previous record. But Billings scored 70 not out to back up Sam Northeast's 67, and the away side's last-wicket pair survived a nervy final 11 balls to end on 184-9. Northamptonshire dented Sussex's hopes of reaching Division One by beating them at Wantage Road, to keep their own slim promotion prospects alive.
Sussex added just nine to their overnight score to finish 393 all out, leaving Northants a target of 140.
The hosts stuttered to 93-4, but Richard Levi's unbeaten 54 helped them to 140-4 and a six-wicket victory.
Liam Norwell finished with career-best figures of 8-43 as Gloucestershire comfortably beat Division Two's bottom side Leicestershire at Grace Road.
The hosts began the final day on 154-7, but could only add six more runs as Norwell claimed the final three wickets within the first 35 minutes of play.

Sri Lanka achieved laudable improvements in its health system: Health Minister
Sri Lanka achieved some laudable improvements in the health system; Malaria eradication, migration health policy, and multi-pronged battle against NCDs are to of them, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
He was addressing the70th Session of the WHO Regional Committee for South East Asia held in Male, Maldives recently.
The Minister said cardiac stents and eye lenses were provided free of charge to patients of government hospitals and prices of commonly used 48 drugs were reduced.
He said Sri Lanka was enjoying universal health coverage for almost six decades. The country managed to have high ranks in many international health indicators by now, especially in its maternal and child health field. Communicable diseases were controlled effectively supported by 100 percent immunization coverage, the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne said Sri Lanka achieved polio free status way back in 1993 and completely controlled lymphatic filariasis last year. The country is now eliminating rabies, mother to child transmission of HIV, measles and congenital rubella and the programme in this regard will complete by 2020.
We have a fairly low viral hepatitis burden. It is below two percent. We will strengthen our routine immunization programme, three doses of the hepatitis B vaccine,soon to be boosted with a birth dose of the vaccine based on expert opinion, he said.

Sri Lanka, Thailand sign MoU for agricultural development
The Memorandum of Understanding between Primary Industries of the Sri Lankan Government and the Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives of the Kingdom of Thailand was signed yesterday at a special ceremony held at the Primary Industries Ministry Auditorium in the presence of Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage and Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chulamanee Chartsuwan.
Primary Industries Ministry Secretary Eng. Bandula Wickremaarchchi and Bank for Agriculture and Agricultural Cooperatives of Thailand Senior Executive Vice President Apirom Sukprasert signed the MoU.
In his address at the signing ceremony, Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage underscored the importance of the signing agreement as it served well for both countries in the time to come.
I must commend Thailand for adopting right policies, creating right institutions and assembling the educated resources to realize the countrys development goals, he said.
The Minister went onto say that target of his Ministry is to double the agriculture-based products and increase the revenue earned by the year 2020 and keep on doubling the exports every five years.
One may say it is a difficult task, but I am very confident that we can make it. And we are determined to accomplish it, the Minister said. Both Thailand and Sri Lanka continue to support each with international political and trade fields.
There has been very steady increase in bilateral trade and ties between our countries have grown rapidly, said the Minister.
Continuing his address the Minister said: For third world countries such as ours, Primary Industries are of utmost importance.
A country should build her economic backbone by developing its Primary Industries at scale and as a gradual progression of that development, secondary sector which produces and manufactures goods, and the tertiary sector which provides services, will be easier to develop.
This is the gradual and organic process of leading a third world country to be a first world country with a strong economic backbone. By entering into MoU, we expect to promote the exchange of information and experiences in the areas of agriculture, agriculture cooperatives, agriculture processing industries, micro-finance and establishing credit lines to support import and export businesses related to primary industries.
I strongly believe that this MOU is a venture that would help achieve this target.
It is my hope and desire that this MoU signed with the best intentions, will be a strong extension of the economic and geopolitical partnership between Sri Lanka and Thailand, added Minister Gamage. Thai Ambassador to Sri Lanka Chulamanee Chartsuwan, speaking at the occasion, recalled the historical relationship both countries enjoyed for centuries and sharing religious and cultural values and said the MoU signed would expand that relationship to new heights. I welcome the signing of the MoU and will look forward to their implementation of the projects mentioned therein for the benefit of both countries, she added.

Suburbs of systems
The system was breaking down. The one who had wandered alone past so many happenings and events began to feel, backing up along the primal vein that led to his center, the beginning of a hiccup that would, if left to gather, explode the center to the extremities of life, the suburbs through which one makes ones way to where the country is.
At this time of life whatever being there is is doing a lot of listening, as though to the feeling of the wind before it starts, and it slides down this anticipation of itself, already full-fledged, a lightning existence that has come into our own.
The trees and the streets are there merely to divide it up, to prevent it from getting all over itself, from retreating into itself instead of logically unshuffling into this morning that had to be, of the day of temptation. It is with some playfulness that we actually sit down to the business of mastering the many pauses and the abrupt, sharp accretions of regular being in the clotted sphere of todays activities. As though this were just any old day.
Right combinations
There is no need for setting out, to advertise ones destination. All the facts are here and it remains only to use them in the right combinations, but that building will be the size of today, the rooms habitable and leading into one another in a lasting sequence, eternal and of the greatest timeliness.
It is all that. But there was time for others, that were to have got under way, sequences that now can exist only in memory, for there were other times for them. Yet they really existed. For instance a jagged kind of mood that comes at the end of the day, lifting life into the truth of real pain for a few moments before subsiding in the usual irregular way, as things do.
These were as much there as anything, things to be fumbled with, cringed before: dry churrings of no timbre, hysterical staccato passages that one cannot master or turn away from. These things led into life. Now they are gone but it remains, calm, lucid, but weightless, drifting above everything and everybody like a light in the sky, no more to be surmised, only remembered as so many things that remain at equal distances from us are remembered.
The light drinks the dark and sinks down, not on top of us as we had expected but far, far from us in some other, unrelated sphere. This was not even the life that was going to happen to us. It was different in those days, though. Men felt things differently and their reactions were different. It was all life, this truth, you forgot about it and it was there. No need to collect your thoughts at every moment before putting forth a hesitant feeler into the rank and file of their sensations: the truth was obstinately itself, so much so that it always seemed about to harden and shrink, to grow hard and dark and vanish into itself anxiously but stubbornly, but this was just the other side of the coin of its intense conviction. It really knew what it was.
Soaring bird
Meanwhile the life uncurled around it in calm waves, unimpressed by the severity and yet not paying much mind, also very much itself. It seemed as though innumerable transparent tissues hovered around these two entities and joined them in some way, and yet when one looked there was nothing special to be seen, only miles and miles of buoyancy, the way the mild blue sky of a summer afternoon seems to support a distant soaring bird. This was the outside reality. Inside there was like a bare room, or an alphabet, an alphabet of clemency. Now at last you knew what you were supposed to know. The words formed from it and the sentences formed from them were dry and clear, as though made of wood. There wasnt too much of any one thing.
The feelings never wandered off into a private song or tried to present the procession of straightforward facts as something like a pageant: the gorgeous was still unknown. There was, however, a residue, a kind of fiction that developed parallel to the classic truths of daily life (as it was in that heroic but commonplace age) as they unfolded with the foreseeable majesty of a holocaust, an unfrightening one, and went unrecognized, drawing force and grandeur from this like the illegitimate offspring of a king. It is this other tradition which we propose to explore. The facts of history have been too well rehearsed (Im speaking needless to say not of written history but the oral kind that goes on in you without your having to do anything about it) to require further elucidation here. But the other, unrelated happenings that form a kind of sequence of fantastic reflections as they succeed each other at a pace and according to an inner necessity of their ownthese, I say, have hardly ever been looked at from a vantage point other than the historians and an arcane historians at that.
The living aspect of these obscure phenomena has never to my knowledge been examined from a point of view like the painters: in the round, bathed in a sufficient flow of overhead light, with all its imperfections on its head and yet without prejudice of the exaggerations either of the anathematist or the eulogist: quietly, in short, and I hope succinctly. Judged from this angle the whole affair will, I think, partake of and benefit from the enthusiasm not of the religious fanatic but of the average, open-minded, intelligent person who has never interested himself before in these matters either from not having had the leisure to do so or from ignorance of their existence.
Accurate idea
From the outset it was apparent that someone had played a colossal trick on something. The switches had been tripped, as it were; the entire world or ones limited but accurate idea of it was bathed in glowing love, of a sort that need never have come into being but was now indispensable as air is to living creatures.
It filled up the whole universe, raising the temperature of all things. Not an atom but did not feel obscurely compelled to set out in search of a mate; not a living creature, no insect or rodent, that didnt feel the obscure twitchings of dormant love, that didnt ache to join in the universal turmoil and hullabaloo that fell over the earth, roiling the clear waters of the reflective intellect, getting it into all kinds of messes that could have been avoided if only, as Pascal says, we had the sense to stay in our room, but the individual will condemns this notion and sallies forth full of ardor and hubris, bent on self-discovery in the guise of an attractive partner who is the heaven-sent one, the convex one with whom he has had the urge to mate all these seasons without realizing it.

Surplus in national income by 2020: Prime Minister
The Government could reduce the deficit of national income over expenditure down to 0.2 percent in 2016 from 1.5 percent in 2014 and by 2020, we hope to ensure an income surplus, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Galle.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a function held in the Samanala Grounds in Galle on Saturday to grant compensations to flood affected tea smallholders and factory owners in Galle.
He said the Government could reduce the gap in deficit because of the farsighted policies aimed at vibrant economy launched by the Unity Government of Good Governance of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Between 2005 and 2014, the countrys foreign borrowings at commercial rate increased by 233 percent. We had to spend 89 percent of the Gross National Income (GNI). By 2016. We needed Rs. 14,740 billion to settle external loans and our GNI was Rs. 113,700. We even had to increase the taxes to increase the government income. Following judicious initiatives taken by the Unity Government, we could reduce the deficit, he said.
Today we could assist our tea smallholders and factory owners as we could initiate many new fiscal policies in the economy. We are not truly satisfied with our achievements. We have gained victories in economy. As a government, we have to serve the country and its people. We have rectified issues relating to balance payments. We have to increase our national income further and have to encourage and draw foreign investments for the purpose. We are also resolved to boost local or foreign ventures to lift our GNP. We inspire overseas investors by introducing relaxed taxation system and have formulated attractive tax concessions to our local financiers. The Inland Revenue Act will address many tax obstacles faced by investors. By the end of the year, the country will witness progress and benefits of our new policies, the Prime Minister said.
He said the GSP Plus was regained and new trade accords with India and Singapore were reached. We have introduced a new Foreign Exchange Act gaining foreign assets to the country. New employment opportunities in large numbers will be provided with the new foreign investments. A new development strategy will come into effect. Starting from Kandy to Wellawaya, a host of novel development projects will be propelled, the Premier said.
He said new industrial zones would be established with the opening of the Kandy Expressway and Kandy would emerged as highly developed metropolitan.
We have special plans to introduce new tourism zones throughout the country with special emphasis over Kalpitiya. Under the Kalutara Industrial Zone, a large industry was already established. We are acquiring suitable lands for the proposed tourism zone in Galle. A distinctive tourism plan is underway to attract high income tourists to Elpitiya, Dedduwa, Balapitiya, Akurala and Koggala aimed at improving income of people in the area. The tourism will be extended up to Matara, the Prime Minister said.
Massive industrial expansion will be in Hamabantota and Wellawaya. The Hambantota Port will be developed by a Chinese-Sri Lanka Joint Venture. The Mattala Airport will be improved as a useful national asset. An oil refinery, power station and a cement industry will be established in those areas. A new tea factory will be set up at Charlymount in Weligama, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Government would usher a massive prosperity to the south and expand the development to Wellawaya.
We brought all these triumphs because we could form a national unity government under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. All parties including the UNP, SLFP, Muslim Congress, upcountry Tamils parties, and Jathika Hela Urumaya were united to form the Good Governance Government to resolve several national issues of the country. We are not prepared to hand over grave national problems of today to the next generation. We do not want to continue the coalition administration for ever. Once we solved the grave national issues of the day, we would start work as separate political entities, he said.
The Prime Minister said the recent floods heavily affected tea smallholders and Ratnapura, Baddegama, Akuressa, Deniyaya, Kalawaana, Rakwana, Agalwatte, Bulathsinhala and Hiniduama were most devastated.
We will assist the tea smallholders in all their adversities. We will improve the industry. We have granted compensations to over 5,600 tea smallholders and 17 tea factories in Galle. We are firmly resolved to fortify the industry and the cultivation. We will assist tea smallholders further, the Prime Minister said.
Ministers Vajira Abeywardana, Gayantha Karunathilake and Chandima Weerakkodi, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva spoke. Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara, Galle District Parliamentarians Wijepala Hettiarachchi and Bandula Lal Bandarigoda were present.

Uniquely Japanese
There is a certain singularity when it comes to our two cultures: Sri Lanka and Japan. We have inevitably fallen in love with each other. What we have in common is this richness of culture. There is a certain distinctiveness and originality about our cultures. There is a certain element of wonder when it comes to our cultures. The Daily News visited the Japanese Cultural Exhibition 2017 celebrating the bicultural relations.
The value of learning Japanese in this day and age, has become invaluable. Japan and Sri Lanka have joined hands. Japan is becoming very involved with Sri Lanka.
The Japanese cultural exhibition 2017 is under the support of the Embassy of Japan in association with the Japanese Language Teachers Association of Sri Lanka. Diplomatic ties between Sri Lanka and Japan have exceeded over 65 years. This annual event from the people of Japan and Sri Lanka is an opportunity to exchange love and respect. Our organisation is dedicated to teaching the Japanese Language to Sri Lankan students so that they can communicate with the Japanese people and come closer to each other, said the Japanese Language Teachers Association President Anju Hewage.
The Japanese culture is extensive. It is a lifelong pursuit for academics. We all know that Japan has a culture which spans over hundreds of years through economic and technological changes. Its architecture, art, animation, music, literature, cuisine and philosophy are very diverse. According to many sources, the contemporary culture combines influences from Asia, Europe and North America. The Japanese philosophy has historically been a fusion of Chinese, the Western, and uniquely its own elements. The Japanese philosophy could be traced about fourteen centuries ago.
We would also like to thank the members of the embassy of Japan and the participating cultural organizations for helping us to facilitate this event giving Sri Lankans the opportunity to learn more about Japan and Japanese culture, said Hewage.
Japanese Ambassador Kenichi Suganuma stated that learning Japanese can open many doors. With Japans influence in Sri Lanka, the Japanese Language Teachers Association plays a commendable role.
I would especially like to thank the Japanese Language Teachers Association because of their efforts. They have worked hard to find this venue and arrange this cultural exhibition for the pleasure of all visitors. I am sure that arranging the logistics would not have been very easy, said Ambassador Suganuma.
The exhibition featured the uniqueness of Japanese Culture: Bonsai and Ikebana. The entire exhibition was no doubt fascinating to those who may not have been familiar with Japanese Culture. The Daily News was told that the intricacy of the Bonsai was a result of extreme patience and hard work. These Bonsai can last almost 100 years. It is a labor of great love and commitment.
I would like to thank all the participating cultural organizations who have worked very hard, collaborating to make this exhibition a reality. This event is meant to introduce Japanese Culture to as many people as possible, added Ambassador Suganuma.
The exhibits on display have been arranged by the Sri Lankan cultural organisations. That simply shows how the Japanese culture has been embraced and welcomed by Sri Lankans.
Ikebana, Bonsai and Origami have all expanded into so many countries. These arts are now world famous and were featured in a big way at the exhibition.
This is a great joy and a matter of pride for us. It is a way that our ancestors are being honored. These arts are enriching. Relations between Japan and Sri Lanka have always been very good. And now it is being promoted further in many areas, pointed out Ambassador Suganuma.
We can see many Japanese offices open up in Sri Lanka. Plus, they look for people who can speak Japanese. The prospects are becoming extremely lucrative in terms of business opportunities.
But the Japanese are not only into business. Many young people enjoy understanding and studying Japanese. Studying Japanese introduces people to a whole new world. Any Japanese visitor might find Sri Lanka a second home in conversation. It is good for pleasure and intellectual stimulation.
That momentum is now being put together.

Vigneshwaran says he is misunderstood by the Southerners
Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneshwaran said people in the South had a wrong impression about him and his group. He said he has no need to divide the country.
He stated this when he called on the Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter at the Malwatte Viharaya in Kandy to receive his blessings.
He said a three Judge Bench of the Supreme Court has ruled that federalism did not lead to a division of the country. Therefore, criticism levelled against him and his group saying federalism would lead to division of the country is a baseless allegation, the Northen Province Chief Minister said.
Vigneshwaran who invited the Malwatte Chief Prelate to visit the North on an inspection tour of community life, as done by the Asgiriya Chief Prelate, said there were 89,000 widows in the North who should be ensured a stable life style through a concerted programme of action.
There was a large number of destitute children and rehabilitated youth in the North and no one had volunteered so far to offer them employment avenues,Vigneshwaran said.
He said Southern fishermen were engaged in fishing in Northern waters with Army assistance and this had caused a problem to Northern fishermen.
He said 18 Brigades with 15,0000 personnel were stationed in the North and he had requested the President Maithripala Sirisena to shuffle them to other parts of the country without restricting them to the North. He said the Armed Forces still occupied 85,000 acres of land of which only 1500 acres had been restored to the people despite contrary propaganda carried out through the media.
The Malwatte Chief Prelate said the request to withdraw the Army from the North at once was unacceptable. It should be done systematically as time progressed. If there were any problems they should be settled through discussions with the government.
Most Ven. Thibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Mahanayake Thera said Army occupied territory was now being systematically restored to the people and added that politicians usually tried to attain party and private gains rather than acting according to the peoples needs.
The Malwatte Chief Prelate also quipped that attending to peoples problems was much more urgent than building highways.
The memorandum formulated by the Northern Tamils Peoples Council was also handed over to the Malwatte Chief Prelate to be forwarded to the government for its consideration.
Provincial Agriculture Minister Kandiah Shivanesan and Provincial Womens Affairs Minister Anandi Shashidaran were also present on the occasion.

Vigneswaran blames AG
The Attorney General's Department were informed to expedite hearing cases of LTTE suspects in prison custody, but it does not seem to happen as requested, Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said.
He was speaking to the media after visiting the LTTE suspects held at the Bogambara Dumbara Prison on September 9.
Vigneswaran said he represented the issue to the President, but the cases were not expedited for various political reasons.
He said justice could be meted out to the detainees by considering their confessions as evidence. He said there was no possibility to punish detainees when their confessions were available as evidence. "Therefore, it was important to take quick action on the matter as the detainees were living with hope of freedom," he said.
Vigneswaran said the Northern Provincial Council defeated the 20th Amendment to the Constitution since it was harmful to the council.
He said NPC administration could be taken over by Parliament after the dissolution of the council until an election was held, according to the provisions in the 20th amendment. "But it is wrong," he said.
He said that when a copy of a letter sent to the Attorney General by the Government informing it to expedite LTTE suspect related cases, a case called last week were postponed to November. He said people in the South had a wrong impression about the north. He would request people in the south not to consider him and his people as terrorists.
He said alteration of news sent by northern journalists to suit the needs of media magnates in the south had caused a bad social impact.
He said the statement made by Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka about former Army Commander Jagath Jayasuriya would be investigated to see whether there was any truth in it.

What the most mysterious manuscript means
For medievalists or anyone with more than a passing interest, the most unusual element of the Voynich manuscript  Beinecke Ms. 408, known to many as the most mysterious manuscript in the world  is its handwritten text. Although several of its symbols (especially the ligatures) are recognizable, adopted for the sake of economy by the medieval scribes, the words formed by its neatly grouped characters do not appear to correspond to any known language.
It was long believed that the text was a form of code  one which repeated attempts by cryptographers and linguists failed to penetrate. As someone with long experience of interpreting the Latin inscriptions on classical monuments and the tombs and brasses in English parish churches, I recognized in the Voynich script tell-tale signs of an abbreviated Latin format. But interpretation of such abbreviations depends largely on the context in which they are used. I needed to understand the copious illustrations that accompany the text.
Bizarre claims
I first came across the Voynich manuscript some fifteen years ago when, as a professional history researcher, I was looking into some of the more bizarre claims by commentators about some of my ancestors  John Florio (15531625) and Jane Fromond (15551604/5), the wife of Dr John Dee and grand-daughter of Thomas Fromond, the great English herbalist.
I am also a muralist and war artist with an understanding of the workings of picture narration, an advantage I was able to capitalize on for my research. A chance remark just over three years ago brought me a commission from a television production company to analyse the illustrations of the Voynich manuscript and examine the commentators theories. By this time the manuscript had been carbon-dated to the early fifteenth century. One of the more notable aspects of the manuscript were the illustrations on a bathing theme, so it seemed logical to have a look at the bathing practices of the medieval period. It became fairly obvious very early on that I had entered the realms of medieval medicine.
To those who have studied medieval medicine, and possess a good knowledge of its origins, the classical physicians Galen (AD 129210), Hippocrates (460370 BC) and Soranus (AD 98138) among them, the Voynich manuscripts incorporation of an illustrated herbarium (collection of plant remedies), Zodiac charts, instructions on thermae (baths) and a diagram showing the influence of the Pleiades side by side will not be surprising.
They are all in tune with contemporary medical treatises, part and parcel of the medieval world of health and healing. Bathing as a remedy is a time-honoured tradition: practised by the Greeks and the Romans, advocated by the classical physicians, and sustained during the Middle Ages.
The central theme of the Voynich manuscript is just such an activity, and one of its chief characteristics is the presence of naked female figures immersed in some concoction or other. Classical and medieval medicine had separate divisions devoted to the complaints and diseases of women, mostly but not exclusively in the area of gynaecology, and covered other topics such as hygiene, food, purgatives, bloodletting, fumigations, tonics, tinctures and even cosmetics and perfumes: all involved taking the waters, by bathing or ingesting.
Useful information
On the evidence of previous commentaries, one could be forgiven for thinking that the sole piece of useful information to have emerged from all the research done on the manuscript since 1969 has been its carbon dating (to 140338). But from the point of view of the importance given to bathing, precision carbon dating is not necessary.
Medical research into the period one hundred years either side of the carbon date will attain the same basic result. One of the more celebrated collections of medical doctrine emerged in the twelfth century from the Italian port city of Salerno, a major centre of medical learning. This compilation of medical dos and donts is known by its generic name of the Trotula.
I first came across the Trotula in an eighteenth-century printed edition in Latin some years before I began my research on the Voynich manuscript, as I browsed through a private library (I had worked in the book department at Christies in the 1970s). The Trotula specializes in the diseases and complaints of women, and encouraged a regime of bathing (among other cures) for a range of maladies; not inconvenient for a city famed for its monastery baths. The Trotula had many incarnations all over Europe, and was widely adapted right up to the 1700s. Its selected procedures, remedies and cures were filched, on the whole, from the earlier writings of Galen, Hippocrates, Pliny and others, who had been guilty of exactly the same plagiarism in their own time.
The most interesting aspect of certain passages of the Trotula is their remarkable similarity, in the details of subject matter  gynaecology, bloodletting and bathing  to the narrative details in the drawings of the Voynich manuscript; and it dawned on me that the Trotula was quite possibly the model for many of its illustrations.
Abbreviated instructions
The Trotula is closely linked to another widely copied manuscript of the medieval period.
De Balneis Puteolanis, which first appeared around 1220, was  unlike the Trotula, which contained blocks of handwritten and partially abbreviated instructions  wonderfully illustrated. Its theme, unsurprisingly, is the health benefits of bathing, specifically in the volcanic springs and mineral baths of Puzzuoli, an ancient health resort on the Phlegraean fields, a volcanic area not far from Naples.
On close inspection of each illustration (there are digitized copies in several world-renowned libraries), I found that the story-board narrative appeared marginally out of step with the poetic text. I also noted that several of the details in each illustration of De Balneis Puteolanis recalled scenes from personal anecdotes in the writings of either Galen or Hippocrates: scenes relating to sleeping draughts, exercise, purgatives and bleeding.
Several of these are replicated in the Voynich manuscript and without much trouble their descriptions can be tracked down in the Trotula.

Where everyone has an equal voice and choice!
International Day of Democracy will be celebrated on Friday September 15, this year. In 2007 the United Nations General Assembly resolved to observe this day with the intention of promoting and upholding the principles of democracy and invited all member states and organisations to commemorate the day in an appropriate manner that contributes to raising public awareness.
It is meant both as a celebration of democracy and as a reminder that the need to promote and protect democracy is as urgent now as ever. This years theme of democracy and conflict prevention focuses on the critical need to strengthen democratic institutions to promote peace and stability. A more integrated approach to foster resilient societies calls for effective and inclusive democratic governance with respect for human rights and the rule of law.
A universal value
This years Democracy Day coincides with the observance at UN Headquarters of the International Day of Peace, under the theme of Peace and Democracy: Make Your Voice heard. The theme for this years celebration is democracy education, the process of ensuring that all peoples of the world fully understand their rights and responsibilities in decision-making. The subject of this years theme is essential for the long-term success of democracy, especially in countries that have recently transitioned to more democratic societies.
It is only with educated citizens that a sustainable culture of democracy can emerge. Democracy is a universal value based on the freely expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems and their full participation in all aspects of their lives. The UN has been stressing the continuing need to promote democratisation, development and respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms.
Democracy is a form of government in which all eligible citizens participate equally - either directly or through elected representatives - in the proposal, development and creation of laws. It encompasses social, economic and cultural conditions that enable the free and equal practice of political self-determination. Democracy contrasts with forms of government where power is either held by one person, as in a monarchy, or where power is held by a small number of individuals, as in an oligarchy.
No consensus exists on how to define democracy, but equality, freedom and rule of law have been identified as important characteristics since ancient times. These principles are reflected in all eligible citizens being equal before the law and having equal access to legislative processes. For example, in a representative democracy, every vote has equal weight and the freedom of its eligible citizens is secured by legitimised rights.
The empowerment of citizens
Democracy is a universal value based on the freely spoken and expressed will of people to determine their own political, economic, social and cultural systems in all aspects of their lives. Evolved over centuries, democracies share many common features, but cannot be reduced to a single model. In short, democracy pertains to the idea that everyone has the right to have their own beliefs and to say and write what they think.
The date chosen for Democracy Day corresponds to the adoption in September 1997 by the Inter-Parliamentary Union of a Universal Declaration on Democracy. That Declaration affirms the principles of democracy, the elements and exercise of democratic government and the global scope of democracy.
Activities carried out by the UN in support of efforts of governments to promote and consolidate democracy are undertaken in accordance with the UN Charter and only at the specific request of the member states concerned. A review of democracy in people of all backgrounds and nations are invited to help raise awareness for the purposes of democracy. In short, it is a reminder to governments, schools and workplaces everywhere that the hallmark of successful and stable democracies is the presence of a strong and freely operating civil society in which government and civil society work together for common goals for a better future.
One of the strongest global trends today is the empowerment of citizens and their desire for dignity and freedom. It is quite appropriate then for us to celebrate the strengthening of citizens voices for democracy.
The role of the citizen in improving the quality of democracy and in political and institutional reform is fundamental. During the past year alone the world has witnessed many examples of citizen-led movements across all continents demanding more responsive government and unless democracy responds to its citizens, it faces a major crisis. When powerful citizen movements spring up as a response to socio-economic crises across all continents, this is a clear call that politics as usual needs to be re-examined.
Clear aspirations
Citizens have always been the driving force behind democratic change and international actors should respect their leadership in building their democracies. Citizen-led assessments provide citizens the needed spaces for dialogue on matters concerning their democracies. It is through citizen-led and owned democracy assessments that they can periodically assess the quality of their own democracies and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
The citizen-led approach to assessing democracy is founded on the conviction that all people including women, youth, minorities, persons with disabilities, indigenous people, the poor and marginalized  know their democracies well and have clear aspirations of how they would like them to develop. They are viewed to possess legitimacy, which external actors are seen to be lacking, to make judgements about the quality of their democracies, debate emerging issues and build consensus around an agenda for broadening and deepening their democracies.
Democratic governments are accountable. Officials and politicians are answerable for their decisions and actions. This reduces the opportunity for corruption. Democracy also subjects governments to the rule of law, which means the law treats everyone, including the government, equally. Rule of law is important because, while it respects the will of the majority, it also protects the fundamental rights of individuals and minority groups.
Civil society is the oxygen of democracy. Civil society acts as a catalyst for social progress and economic growth. It plays a critical role in keeping Government accountable and helps represent the diverse interests of the population, including its most vulnerable groups.
Yes democracy has many forms but the most important part never changes, giving everyone a voice. When people engage in the democratic process they have a say in the decisions that influence their lives. Democracy can be found everywhere, from governments creating laws to friends deciding on what game to play.
