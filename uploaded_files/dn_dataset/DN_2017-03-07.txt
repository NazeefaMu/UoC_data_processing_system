Sigiriya Jungles adds accountable value to cultural triangle
Sigiriya Jungles, a star class resort was unveiled at an investment of Rs. 880 million in the region of Audangawa in Sigiriya.
The new resort initially commenced operations in October 2016 after undergoing a construction phase of two and a half years. One of the main attributes of the resort is its central location being made accessible to the country's cultural triangle which comprises of Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Sigiriya, Dambulla and Kandy.
The Sigiriya Jungles is made up of 60 luxurious chalets comprising of suites, deluxe and deluxe plus rooms that have been setup following a village concept that has been confined within a 10 acre plot of land.
To date, the occupancy rate has been favourable, having attracted over 60% of tourist activity and tourists have been reported to have hailed from countries such as the United Kingdom, France, Germany and China with an average stay of 2 to 3 nights. Sigiriya Jungles is part of the travel company JourneyScapes and is run by the company's Chairman, Devindre Senaratne. Senaratne also happens to be the President of the Sri Lanka Association of Inbound Tour Operators (SLAITO).
Commenting on the opening of Sigiriya Jungles to travel enthusiasts, Senaratne said, "My belief is that if one wants to experience the real taste of Sri Lanka, then booking a stay at a convenient location such as ours would no doubt add value to your holiday. Sigiriya Jungles is located at a point where you can easily access the cultural triangle and not have to worry about spending too much time going back and forth."

SLFP graduates body  wants SAITM run as  public-private partnership
The Sri Lanka Freedom Graduates Association (SLFGA), an organisation affiliated to the SLFP has asked that South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) be run as a public-private partnership with the state having the majority share.
The SLFGA which has branches in 102 electorates in the past has spoken for the rights of unemployed graduates.
Their stance lies contradictory to that of SLFP MPs who have stated that SAITM would not be abolished or taken over. General Secretary of the SLFGA, Manjula Perera addressing a media briefing at SLFP headquarters said the private ownership of SAITM should be abolished, The government can have a 51 percent stake in the institution giving Dr. Neville Fernando 49 percent. At the end of the day, we propose that the state controls it, he said.
The organization as submitted the following proposals to President Maithripala Sirisena who is currently working on a solution to the problem.
The recommendations include: a committee be appointed to come up with recommendations on the future plan of action for those currently studying at SAITM; to increase the internship period from one to two years to compensate for the lack of patients during clinical training; an opportunity be granted for SAITM students to sit for the Examination For Registration to Practise Medicine in Sri Lanka (ERPM) exam to be registered as a doctor under the SLMC and a committee to be appointed to study the state of medical education and the registration of medical professions in Sri Lanka and recommendation in three months time.
While the SLFGA has insisted that medical education not be run by a profit making institute, they also stress that this issue should not be used as a reason to launch another campaign of terror in the country, similar to that of the late 80s, We dont want youth being sacrificed in vain again, said Perera.

Small Hydropower Industry potential yet to be maximised
Foreign exchange potential via technology export 
Sri Lanka's small hydropower industry has been etching a significant number of milestones since its inception in 1996.
Just 20 years on, it collates a total of 169 projects producing 337.77 MW, been named by the World Bank as the best performing project of its kind and become the sought after role model by countries in Africa and South Asia as well as the World Bank, UNIDO, ADB and IFC which has thus seen Sri Lanka establish its first technology export.
In addition, there has been a saving of Rs 19 bn on foreign exchange given the industry's contribution to the national grid with a generation of 4,000 in direct employment for 4,000 and 5,000 indirectly. The Small Hydropower Association details the critical success factors that have seen this impressive growth in the sector, which includes an investment appetite imbuing a risk-taking pioneering spirit with a long term view of profit and a ready mindset to work on a concept of profit sharing with engineers.
Batathotamini hydropowerproject Ratnapura

Experienced engineers who showcase their prowess through knowledge transfer working with large scale hydropower plants and quick adaptation to global know-how applied to the local context. The government's support for industry growth as exampled by minimal barriers for the entry of a project, concessionary rates and reasonable tariffs that prompt commercial viability. A refinancing scheme introduced by the World Bank for commercial banks has also added impetus.
As Director (Development) of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena confirms, with the introduction of the cost based technology specific tariff introduced by the Government to promote the entirety of the renewable energy industry, the capacity increased manifold, auguring well for the country's ultimate vision of becoming an energy hub.
Becoming an energy hub means using resources available within one's own country without losing sight of the sustainable dynamic.
I have observed how the SHPs have worked well on the basis of the triple bottom line, contributing energy to the national grid and therefore saving on foreign exchange expended on energy, infusing foreign exchange through the sharing of expertise and knowledge with other countries, expanding renewable energy capacity by developing more projects and reducing CO2 emissions which minimizes carbon footprint.
He hastens to add that in some cases there have been communities who have opposed the establishment of such SHPs, based on the misconception that their water source is being affected. These projects work on a run-of-the-river basis and communities believe that once the water is harnessed, they won't have their water.
The reality is there is a minimum flow for about 50 meters or so. But Jayawardena does mention that communities have benefited immensely with the presence of these SHPs with each SHP entity supporting education, healthcare and developing infrastructure for the communities in those areas.
The industry's full potential, however, is yet to be realized. The SHP Association urges the improvement of tariff formulation methodologies to reflect more realistic project development costs, building capacity within the Sustainable Energy Authority to streamline land acquisition and approvals, granting extensions for reasonable refurbishment rates for projects completing 15 years augmenting investor confidence and a re-establishment of the five year tax holiday.
A more transparent and accountable process is also recommended for the purchase of power, amendments to the Electricity Act effected and a firm stance maintained on the common national development effort to protect stakeholders from false and misinformed propaganda being disseminated to the public.

Sri Lanka joins South Asian partners to safeguard childrens rights
Sri Lankan legislators have joined fellow lawmakers from across South Asia to prioritise and safeguard children's rights in the region, UNICEF said yesterday.
UNICEF said that despite economic growth and consequent improvements in realising the rights of children, massive disparities still exist preventing children from living in dignity, reaching their full potential and making choices about their futures.
Sri Lanka, home to 8 million children under 18, has some of the region's best health indicators, almost universal primary schooling, with nearly 90 percent of the population having access to safe drinking water.
UNICEF noted that violence against children, including physical abuse in the home remains a concern and while the rate of extreme poverty is declining (by 16 percent between 2002 and 2012) child poverty rates remain higher with pockets of extremely high vulnerability across the nation.
"Even though our indicators are really good, we still have issues like child marriage, school dropouts and migration affecting children," parliamentarian Sudarshani Fernandopulle said at the first meeting of the South Asia Parliamentarian Platform for Children.
"Children remain at the heart of a country's development and future economic growth. We need to invest more in policy reform and budgetary allocation to address the remaining disparities that prevent every child, especially the most vulnerable and marginalized from reaching their full potential," she added.
UNICEF said the children's regional meeting was a milestone in bringing together lawmakers from all eight countries in South Asia to prioritise, promote, and safeguard children's rights. It added that it was also an opportunity to plug in the critical role that parliamentarians can play in tackling key development challenges affecting children in the region within the larger framework of the Sustainable Development Goals.

He said the world has made immense strides in new technology during the last 15 years, and we too should reach that status if we are to march towards progress.
He was speaking as chief guest at the 150th anniversary celebrations of the Kegalle St. Marys Maha Vidyalaya on its concluding day on March 5.
The Prime Minister said we would not have a future as a country unless we acquired modern technology. In 1977, we introduced the free market economy and the garment industries. Today we cannot gain much progress by depending on the garment industry unless we more onto other industries, he said. The Prime Minister said entire villages flocked together in the past and joined hands during the harvesting season. Today harvesting was done using machinery and some people earned money by lending machineries nicknamed Bhoothayo to harvest paddy and thresh.
Our motive should be to reach the status of producing motors and mobile phone spare parts. Certain people had mixed feelings about industrialization thinking technology would deprive large number of people of jobs by making intensive labour superfluous. This was a false notion. Technology would not displace people from jobs, he said.
The Prime Minister appreciated the support extended to the development of the school by Chief Minister Herath and Minister Kabir Hashim. He said the government too would help the school build its proposed swimming pool.
Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam, State Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim, and Industries State Minister Champika Premadasa were present.

Wimal Weerawansa further remanded till March 20

National Freedom Front Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa arrested for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister causing a loss of Rs. 91 million to the government was yesterday ordered to be further remanded till March 20 by Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
On a previous occasion, the Magistrate had ordered to release SEC former Deputy General Manager Samantha Lokuhennadige on bail after taking into consideration his 12-year-old daughters mental health condition as an exceptional circumstance.
Weerawansa was arrested by the FCID on January 10 on charges under the Public Property Act.
Meanwhile, the FCID informed Court that they have concluded preliminary investigations into the incident and expected to forward the extracts of the investigation to the Attorney General for his advice.
On January 24, the Magistrate refused to enlarge the former Minister on bail observing that the evidence presented before Court have proved that former Minister Weerawansa had intentionally given these vehicles to his close relatives and his party activists while they were not holding any position at the SEC.
The Magistrate further observed that it is apparent that the former Minister has intentionally and dishonestly misappropriated these vehicles by entrusting them to his close relatives and party activists.
Weerawansa had sought bail from the Colombo High Court challenging the Fort Magistrates order to refuse bail and this bail revision application is to be taken up for support on March 8.
The FCID conducting investigations into the alleged misuse of state vehicles had informed Court that Weerawansa had given his written and verbal approval for the commission of these offences while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister.
These vehicles had been given to the SEC on a rental basis to carry out ministerial functions. However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015. However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court against Weerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister causing a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.

National Freedom Front Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa remanded for allegedly misusing 40 vehicles belonging to the State Engineering Corporation (SEC) while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister yesterday made a statement in open Court citing that no attorney was appearing on his behalf.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne allowed MP Weerawansa to make a statement in accordance with section 127 (1) of the Criminal Procedure Code.
Making his statement in open Court, MP Weerawansa alleged that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents. He said the FCID had launched an unfair inquiry against him in order to satisfy the governments objectives.
He further informed Court that the allegations leveled against him should have been framed as a civil lawsuit instead of filing charges under the Public Property Act. He further moved Court that he be released on bail taking into consideration fact that he is a public representative and needs to fulfill his requirements as a Parliamentarian.

The Magistrate announced that she would deliver her bail order on next hearing date.

Young players have stepped up under Hathurusingha - Mushfiqur
GALLE: Galle holds special memories for Bangladesh captain Mushfiqur Rahim for it is at this venue four years ago when his team last toured Sri Lanka that he made his highest Test score - a brilliant double century. That marathon effort enabled Bangladesh to record their highest total in Test cricket  638.
It is always a nice feeling to have achieved something as an individual and team, said Mushfiqur. But it is a new game, and it looks like a new Sri Lanka attack apart from Rangana [Herath]. We have to play our best cricket to compete with them. It is very important to start well as a team.
Mushfiqur said playing in Sri Lanka is a big challenge.
They are playing in their home conditions and they recently defeated Australia. We would never take them lightly, as they are lions. But this time we have the chance to grab some good results for us. All the boys are keen and excited, Mushfiqur said.
Bangladesh has yet to beat Sri Lanka in 16 Tests  losing 14 and drawing two.
Comparing the Galle pitch on which he made his highest Test score and the one being prepared for todays Test, Mushfiqur said, It is probably a bit different than the 2013 Test wicket. It is still a nice wicket to bat on, although I think there will be something for the quicks in the first two days. The wind might also help them with movement. As the days progress, spin will also come into play.
Mushfiqur will not be keeping wickets in this series; his place going to 22-year-old Liton Das who many believe is a better wicket-keeper.
It is a decision from the management. Sometimes it can do well for you, sometimes it doesnt. The heat here is such that it doesnt matter if youre keeping or fielding. It is a tough job, said Mushfiqur.
I have said it repeatedly that my keeping helped me understand the wicket better, which helped me as a batsman. It will be a different feeling. I have to do what I am told to do, for the team. I am happy, and I will try to contribute as much as possible as a top-order batsman. I have played as a batsman before. The difference of course is that I will be without the pad and gloves.
The 29-year-old wicket-keeper batsman is one of the few cricketers who played in the pre and post Chandika Hathurusingha era and he spoke of the changes that he has brought to the team.
Five years ago, two or three guys were performing well, but now there are five or six guys. The young players have stepped up, like Mehedi and Mustafizur. They have strengthened our side. It is the beauty of our team. It is a good sign for Bangladesh cricket. In the near future we will have more players to put their hands up, said Mushfiqur. - ST

Govts political opponents using online space to distort countrys image
Hitting out strongly at fake news, President Maithripala Sirisena said the governments political opponents were misusing the cyber space to paint a wrong picture about Sri Lanka.
Sri Lankans living overseas are particularly vulnerable to such fake news campaigns, the President said, speaking to the Sri Lankan community in Jakarta, the capital city of Indonesia, last evening.
The President, addressing the meeting which took place three hours after his arrival in Jakarta, urged the Sri Lankan expatriates not to fall victim to fake news on web and social media platforms.
President Sirisena said the new governments rise to power had created a shift in the international communitys viewpoints on Sri Lanka.
My visit to Jakarta is the first after former Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaikes visit to Indonesia in 1976. I will also be the first Sri Lankan Head of State to pay a state visit to Russia in four decades,
the President said, just weeks away from his visit to Russia on an invitation by his Russian counterpart Vladmir Putin.
These visits, the President said, underscore the fact that Sri Lanka has received more recognition and acceptance from the international community as a result of the new governments reforms programme.
We have brought back democracy to Sri Lanka. The draconian 18th Amendment was replaced with the 19th Amendment which ensured the establishment of independent commissions. We will continue to on the path of democratic political reforms, the President explained. He also planted a na sapling at the Sri Lankan embassy premises in Jakarta to mark the beginning of his visit.

138th Battle of the Blues : Royal confident despite winless run
With last years sensational win still lingering in the back of their minds Royal College will be raring to go and may be anticipating a repetition when they take on their traditional rivals S. Thomas College Mt Lavinia in the 138th annual Battle of the Blues cricket encounter at the SSC grounds on March 9, 10 and 11.
The current season cannot be considered as one of the best for both schools where performance is concerned. Royal come out for the big one without a single outright win, a handful of first innings wins and a bad loss to Prince of Wales College, Moratuwa which they would like to forget. Whatever the outcome during the season, either side has the tendency to give their best when it comes to the big occasion. So it is apparent that in this game too one outstanding performance at the most unexpected and crucial moments cannot be written off that could change the course of the game.
Royals top order batting seems to be impressive with skipper Helitha Vithanage topping the 1000- run mark with three centuries. Their openers Ronuka Jayawardena and Lasindu Nanayakkara have been striking the ball well and with last years centurion Pasindu Sooriyabandara and Kavindu Madarasinghe an impressive debutant in the runs, Royals batting looks capable enough to rattle up big scores and apply the pressure on the Thomians.
Kavindu Madarasinghe playing in his first year is in the range of the 1000-run mark (911) with a century and six fifties to his credit. Himesh Ramanayake is another blooming all rounder to watch. Himesh is the son of former Sri Lanka Test paceman and national bowling coach Champaka Ramanayake. Himesh played an integral part in last years victorious Royal team. The tally between the two schools stands at 35 wins to Royal and, 34 to the Thomians with the rest ending in draws in the 137-year long history of the series.
Himesh Ramanayake and Ganith Sandeepa have shared the red cherry to good effect with over 70 wickets between them.
Royalist and former Sri Lanka cricketer Sumithra Warnakulasuriya has the distinguished honour of making the highest individual score 197 in the 1980 encounter. In 1972 Duleep Mendis struck 184 to remain as the top scorer in the series for the Mount Lavinia school. The 254- run partnership for the third wicket between Anushka Polonowita and Yasas Dharmaratne in 1996 stands as the highest partnership for any wicket.
Last year too, both teams scored a total of 300 plus, but the mere 127 scored by the Thomians in their second innings with Himesh Ramanayake taking four wickets made the difference and paved the way for the Royal victory. This year too, Ramanayake will be there as the deputy skipper with all the regalia to torment the opponents.
Skipper Vithanage too has excelled with the new ball and besides his batting could provide Royal stability. There is Abhishek Perera and Chamaka Edirisinghe as the other seamers. According to knowlegeable followers of the game off spinner Ganith Sandeepa and 15-year-old Manula Perera a left arm leg spinner playing in his first season are capable of making inroads into the Thomian batting.
Royal College squad: Helitha Vithanage (Captain), Himesh Ramanayake Vice Captain), Pasindu Sooriyabandara, Ronuka Jayawardene Ganith Sandeepa, Kavindu Senaratne, Manula Perera, Krishigan Raveendranathan, Lakindu Nanayakkara, Gayan Dissanyake, Chamaka Edirisinghe, Abhishek Perera, Gothama Ranasinghe, A.Wickremasinghe, Yuvin Herath, Kavinda Madarasinghe, Kushan Gunaratne.

AG drops Public  Property charges against Lalith  Weeratunga
While filing amended indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita regarding controversial Sil Redhi distribution (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) case, the Attorney General yesterday decided to drop charges which had been filed under the Public Property Act against the two accused.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing on behalf of the Attorney General informed Colombo High Court that the case against the accused would be proceeded with under section 386 of the Penal Code for dishonestly misappropriating a sum of Rs. 600 million.
Accordingly, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga fixed the case for trial on March 13.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita, in connection with criminal misappropriation of Rs.600 million belonging to the TRC funds during the 2015-Presidential Election campaign.
While making his dock statements, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunga had informed Court that it is unfair to frame charges against him under the Public Property Act since he had not benefited from the Sil Redhi distribution programme.
Lalith Weeratunga further told Court that he had to follow the orders issued by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the executive of the country.
Taking into consideration the facts, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had directed the Attorney General to consider the possibility of amending the indictments.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against the two accused on three counts of committing a criminal misappropriation of funds amounting to Rs.600 million at TRC while spending for a Sil Redhi distribution program in contravention of the Telecommunication Act, No. 25 of 1991 Act during the period of October 30, 2014 to January 5, 2015.
The prosecutors alleged that the funds referred to had been remitted to a bank account maintained by the Secretary to the President.
The charges had been filed under the Penal Code and Public Property Act while listing 21 persons as the prosecution witnesses.
Former Election Commissioner Mahinda Deshapriya and former Presidents Coordinating Secretary (Religious Affairs) Ven. Vatinapaha Somananda Thera are among the persons who had been named as witnesses.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the prosecution.
Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa with counsel Kanchana Rathwatte and Niroshan Siriwardena appeared for the accused.

Amaraweeras ultimatum
Its decision time for the SLFP led UPFA. Alliance General Secretary Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, on Thursday, practically read the riot act to the Joint Opposition, headed by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to either rejoin the SLFP or face the consequences. A decision will have to be taken soon with regard to the JO which is doing immense damage to the party, Amaraweera went onto state. It was obvious that the day of reckoning had to come, sooner or later, for the rebels, who had virtually split the SLFP down the middle. The gulf is only beginning to widen, with the JO doing its own thing, holding rallies and staging agitations, relegating the SLFP to the shadows.
Today (07) it is holding a womens rally to commemorate International Womens Day at the Vihara Maha Devi Park, with Mahinda Rajapaksa as the main speaker. There is also May Day looming, with the JO all out to outdo the SLFP in the numbers. The mainstream SLFP also cannot remain forever in the shadow of the UNP which is the senior partner in the Unity Government and it must someday strike out on its own and form a SLFP government. The current split will in no way help the party in this endeavour, and, in fact, the SLFPs prospects in this respect is doomed, with the major proportion of the rank and file solidly behind the JO.
What is more, Local Government elections cannot be postponed indefinitely and the Provincial Council elections for Sabaragamuwa, North Central and the East are beckoning. President Sirisena, as the leader of the SLFP, cannot afford to have the JO best his party at the polls (if it contests separately) or for that matter, even allow a victory for the UNP. Such a prospect would only undermine his authority as the party leader. Besides, no Local Government or Provincial Council election have ever been lost by a party whose leader was the countrys President, in the past (D. B. Wijetunga excepting) and the President will not want to be the first in this respect.
On the other hand, the major split in the SLFP, as at present, will virtually give the UNP a walkover at any election and this prospect too would not endear the President to his party supporters who consider the Grand Old Party as their chief enemy. Hence, it all points to a grand showdown, this time around, more so, with elections pending and the need to shore up the partys fortunes uppermost in the minds of the SLFP seniors. Will the party take disciplinary action against the rebels Such a prospect too is fraught with risk. Disciplinary action would naturally follow a suspension of party membership and an exit from parliament. What would ensue are court battles by those expelled which would likely drag on, further exacerbating the crisis. But, the matter could not be prolonged indefinitely if the SLFP is to assert itself. Hence, what amounts to an ultimatum of sorts, by the UPFA General Secretary, who no doubt, would have had the nod of the President to go ahead.
The JO accounts for some 50 MPs and should they all be expelled from the party, as well as parliament the grouping no doubt would be dealt a crippling blow. Perhaps, this is why it has formed a proxy political party under Prof. G.L. Peiris in a move to buy insurance if push comes to a shove. It is ironic, though, to observe the SLFP, which, while in power, engineered debilitating splits in the UNP, that ruined its electoral prospects, is today being placed in the same bind. The split in the UNP was occasioned by Mahinda Rajapaksa buying over its MPs to get the 18th Amendment, ensuring a lifetime Presidency for him, passed while the current SLFP split is due to a power struggle within the party, with the rebels wanting to enthrone Rajapaksa in the seats of power once again. In the melee, there are elements in the Maithri faction, such as Dilan Perera and Isura Devapriya, who are taking pot shots at the UNP and its leader to keep up appearance that the SLFP still considers the Greens as its main enemy.
Be that as it may, interesting times are ahead in the countrys political landscape, as onetime buddies fight it out between them while the UNP watches the unfolding drama from the sidelines, waiting to reap the harvest from the fallout. The irony certainly wont be lost on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who, at one time, was forced to see his party virtually disintegrating before his own eyes due to the machinations of the SLFP led governments. Interestingly, the JO wants the SLFP faction in the Unity Government to ditch the UNP as a condition for returning to the fold, while the Blues have gone to the extent of extending the two year cohabitation agreement until the government runs its full course. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike who founded the SLFP, as an alternative to the UNP, certainly would not have visualized such a scenario, where his party, or a faction of it, is today united with the sworn enemy.

Appeal for kidneys of brain dead
About 5,000 Sri Lankans become kidney patients annually and 75 percent of them fall sick due to known reasons. Only 25 percent of them become victims of Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU), Maligawatta National Institute of Nephrology, Dialysis and Transplantation Institute Deputy Director General Dr. Rathnasiri Hewage said. Addressing a group of journalists at the Associated Newspapers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL) in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Hewage said annually around 750 Sri Lankans become `brain dead and there are 1,500 healthy and transplantable kidneys in them.
This number meets the number of total annual kidney requirement of Sri Lanka. Once a person falls into a `brain dead condition, he/she will die within two or three days and there is no way in the world to save the life of such a person, he said.
According to Dr. Hewage, at present, any Sri Lankan who wishes to donate his/her kidneys after death, can simply visit www.nindt.health.gov.lk and download the application form, fill it, forward it and obtain the `Card issued in order to express the willingness to donate kidneys after death. The contact numbers are 011242233535 / 36.
Dr. Hewage pointed out that if anyone in any ICU is in a `brain dead condition, his/her close relations can express consent to donate his/her kidneys by contacting the doctors in the ICU and the Transplant Coordinators in the relevant hospital.
The Government has legalized kidney donations of dead persons and the dead person or his/ her relatives can earn immeasurable merit by making the donation that will save a precious life.
All information of donors and recipients are strictly protected and only one person in the country has access to the information. The information is not available online. Therefore, there is no way of matching the kidneys of the donors and recipients by a second or third party and `arrange donations. On the other hand, a kidney cannot be donated that easily because three sets of one medical tests should be done in order to match a donor and a recipient, he added.

GALLE: What makes the two-Test series between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh more than a contest on this occasion is because the input the opposition has about the hosts due to three former cricketers being present in their support staff.
One of them the key figure Chandika Hathurusingha is a former Sri Lanka cricketer and a former Sri Lanka A team as well as senior team coach who is now the head coach of the Bangladesh side. His presence gives him access to the players, conditions and pitches that Sri Lanka will come up with against Bangladesh on the tour which could be a vital factor in determining the series.
Stand-in captain Rangana Herath well aware what is in store for them said, Bangladesh have some advantage as they know our conditions and our players and all that. But this is a new game and at the end of the day its the team that plays well that wins.
They have some advantage no doubt. But as I said you have to play well. If you dont play well you are not going to win. We have prepared as well as we could. I am sure they too have done the same.
Having vital information of the opposition is nearly half the battle won and Bangladesh cricket which is on a high at the moment having beaten England in a Test match at home for the first time will fancy their chances against a Sri Lankan side that is still finding its feet at the moment with
an unsettled batting line up where the players are unaware of their positions going from one series to another.
For instance the openers slot sees a change from the last home series against Australia that Sri Lanka won so convincingly. There is no Kaushal Silva and his regular opening partner Dimuth Karunaratne saved his Test place with a double century in the second unofficial test against England Lions at Dambulla last month. Karunaratne will have another left-hander Upul Tharanga as his partner for this series.
In the 25 Test appearances Tharanga has made since making his debut 12 years ago, Bangladesh is one country that he has scored a Test century against - the other being against Zimbabwe. Tharanga has not opened in a Test since August 2015 against India at the SSC when he was dismissed for 4 and 5.
The no. 3 slot has become an enigma for Sri Lanka and Herath who will captain Sri Lanka in the two Tests in the absence of regular skipper Angelo Mathews (injured) said, Maybe Kusal (Mendis). We havent decided on much.
We will wait for tomorrow morning to take a final call.
Since making his Test debut against West Indies in October 2015, Mendis has batted from positions 2 to 5. Of the four occasions he has gone past the fifty mark three times he has batted at number four and that includes the series turning century of 176 against Australia.
Herath also stated that Dinesh Chandimal who has been the designated wicket-keeper in 24 of the 34 Tests he has played so far has been relieved from that position which will now be taken by Niroshan Dickwella who has kept wickets in three of the four Tests he has played.
That move is certainly not going to be a permanent one for according to Herath, Whether we are going to stick with Chandi as wicketkeeper or move on with Niroshan needs to be spoken of. I need to talk to the selectors.
Herath said the thinking behind the change of wicket-keeper is to give Chandimal who is expected to bat at number four more freedom to concentrate on his batting especially with Mathews being unavailable. The Lankan vice-captain came out of a lean patch with a stunning knock of 190 not out for Sri Lanka Presidents XI against Bangladesh in the two-day warm-up match at Moratuwa.
Bangladesh is an opponent Chandimal has been prolific against scoring three of his seven Test hundreds including an unbeaten 116 at Galle in 2013 when Bangladesh last played here.
Good to see guys like Dimuth and Chandi back in form. They have scored some big runs in the last couple of weeks and thats important for the team, said Herath.
I am very happy leading the team into this Test series. The Bangladesh series is going to be tough. The guys I am sure are looking forward to do their best. I have lot of confidence in my team. We have been doing our training very well. We are confident.
Even the position of Dhananajaya de Silva batting at number six is yet undecided.
He has been batting at number six and we need to chat to the selectors and sort out where he needs to play. Dhananjaya most probably will bat below Chandimal at number six, said Herath.
In that event the Lankan batting will read as: Karunaratne, Tharanga, Mendis, Chandimal, Gunaratne, De Silva and Dickwella, Herath will head the bowling along with Suranga Lakmal and Lahiru Kumara for pace, but the second spinner will be a toss-up between Lakshan Sandakan and Dilruwan Perera.

Battle of the gentlemen
The title refers in general to what are cricket matches played by rival schools who have traditional fixtures elevated to the level of a Big Match. Most are played in March every year by the senior team. The fixtures are seen across many parts of the country.
Cricket as we all know is popular across the country. Its expensive. A ground to practice and play is a luxury for many. A matting wicket is a basic need. A turf even more. Knowledgeable coaches, physiotherapists, physical trainers are not easy to find and come with a price attached. A school excelling has to build up teams from the junior years to enable a sustainable cricketing regime.
A successful cricket programme attracts interest from parents and boys. Principals and staff of public schools have to manage within budgets allocated by the Ministry whilst being subject to service based transfers.
Old boys become involved if they were successful themselves in school and after. Once a cricket programme is established top up funding is required through sponsorship. Sponsors invest if it gives visibility for their identity and products or services. Each child requires cricketing gear which does not come cheap. Last but not least there is an element of nutrition for sports which entails some expenses.
Ombudspersons for sports
If sufficient numbers attend practices, parents and children alike clamour for their child to play competitive games. The human element enters with variable notions of equal opportunity and fair play. These are all daunting challenges for any school and cricketer.
Sports being competitive mechanisms are required for appeals to be lodged to act as an arbitrator to listen to grievances involving unfair treatment of students or ill treatment by school authorities. Ombudsperson render services on a purely voluntary basis and/or honourary capacity.
What is the Ombudsperson
The Ombudsperson would serve as an impartial, independent and confidential resource to assist the school and students in resolving problems, complaints, conflicts, and other sports related issues and/or grievances.
What will the Ombudsperson do
Assist in solving problems and/or disputes.
Serve as a resource to complainants by providing an alternative to the formal complaint process.
Assist complainants in clarifying their issues and generating options for resolution.
Serve as a resource to the school administrators by providing the tools for effective dispute resolution.
Make non-binding recommendations to the head of school, based on facts and circumstances uncovered in the course of the inquiries and/or investigations carried out.
Hear anonymous requests for information and provide referrals.
What will the Ombudsperson NOT do
Address employee grievances.
Participate in litigation.
Make, set or change policy.
Compel any decision or exert any influence regarding the implementation of recommendations made as a result of an informal inquiry/investigation.
Breach confidentiality.
What types of issues will the Ombudsperson handle Unfair and/or unequal treatment, harassment, discrimination, clarification of policies and procedures.
Tools used by the Ombudsperson - Current criteria to participate, be chosen and where applicable hold office in teams will be made known to all at practices and will be publicly displayed, No team or pool of players will have any practice of soliciting in kind contributions from players, parents, All Coaches and Masters in Charge or Teachers in Charge subscribe to a Code of Conduct.
Application for review
Complaints could only be made by students and parents/guardians. The complaint should be made within days of any incident or practice seen as discriminatory, unfair or unwarranted by the student. The Ombudsperson may at his discretion call for additional information from the complainant. At the inquiry, all concerned parties would be afforded a fair hearing. It would be solutions based where consensus is sought and if not the Ombudsperson would pronounce his recommendations and transmit the same to the Head of school for necessary action.
A handful at best has this facility in Sri Lanka.
Organising Big Matches
A venue costs. Tents as they are euphemistically termed need to be rigged, tickets sold, sponsors found, service providers contracted, media sponsors found, security arranged and umpires allocated. The Big Match with a higher profile sees old boys working for a minimum of seven months to organise a match every year. School perfects, house prefects and stewards are deployed. Souvenirs are produced by some schools. The match days entail exhausting work for those deployed. Most are volunteers spending time and energy to set up events which provide much entertainment.
The cricket
A focus on results masks skills and performances. Its no different at Big Matches. Cricket requires eleven to perform for a team performance. A tail ender who scores two whilst his partner contributes the winning runs in an hours play contributes equally to the win. Leadership and leaders within teams are another prerequisite. Laws and regulations around cricket have become more exacting. Its not a game played by white flannelled fools! We not only have on - field umpires, we have a third umpire and match referee. Standards of conduct and playing styles are regulated. The Big Match is ultimately a cricket match. There is a notion the hype around Big Matches is bigger than the cricket. It is not and must not be.

Breathing life to local cinema
The Film Directors Guild of Sri Lanka aka FDGSL in a bid to revive local film industry has proposed a policy package to the authorities. The package consists of short term and long term plans for uplifting the industry and making it a profit making trade once again.
At an event held at Mahaweli Centre with the participation of a number of film personalities, media personnel and film enthusiasts, FDGSL Chairman Bennett Ratnayake read out the proposed policy package. He said FDGSL being the strongest lobby-group in the local film sphere currently is committed to make the package legislative with the help of film personnel, film lovers and authorities.
The proposed policy package mainly focuses on streamlining distribution and screening of local films.
The local film industry is 70 years old now. In 1972 the National Film Corporation was formed. NFC made the film industry flourish. Dr D B Nihalsinghe spearheaded this operation. Diverse factors following that for decades contributed to the downfall of local cinema. Now we are in a digital era. We have to fast track our initiatives to revive local cinema, said Ratnayake.
He said a 21 page proposal is already submitted to the President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, Minister of Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Gayantha Karunatilleke and Secretary to the Ministry Nimal Bopage, Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and NFC Chairman Deepal Chandraratne.
The need to establish a National Film Regulatory Board, Film Screening Circuit Evaluation Committee and an entity established for the Development and Promotion of the Local Film industry is highlighted in the proposal.
Ratnayake added, We intend to make this package a legislative document with the support of relevant quarters. We as filmmakers must unite to pressure the authorities to make this noble cause materialize.
FDGSL Executive member Jackson Anthony said any industry has its customers and consumers and the filmgoers are the consumers of a film industry. He said the film industry must provide credible products or good films to satisfy its consumers. He said an action-plan must be implemented to put this viable proposal of FDGSL into practice.
FDGSL Executive member Jayantha Chandrasiri said cinema represents the art sphere while operating as an industry. He said this industry should evolve to provide benefits to filmgoers.
Somaratne Dissanayake said FDGSL proposal has to be fine-tuned to strike a balance prior to implementing since more relevant parties will have feasible ideas. He said another proposal with the knowledge of former FDGSL Chairman Prasanna Vithanage has been submitted to authorities.
FDGSL Secretary Udayakantha Warnasuriya appreciated entrance of youth to the local cinema sphere as film directors at a transitional period like this.
He said inferior quality films made in 1990s was one crucial factor that made the industry lose its credibility and distribution of films go haywire.
Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja, Jeevan Kumaratunga, Sunil T Fernando, Mohan Hettiarachchi, Dilhani Ekanayake were others occuping the head table.
Salient Points in the proposed Policy Package by FDGSL
Short Term Proposals:
1.1) Regularization of the processes in distribution and exhibition Local Films.
1.2) Rectification of the Irregularities in Screening related Revenue Sharingarrangements which are currently in use.

CAA busts  cosmetics racket
The Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) officials has begun a probe on one of the largest cosmetics rackets to be discovered to-date in Wellampitiya .
The latest probes come in the wake of the seizure of the largest contraband of skin cream haul by two alert Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) officials on March 1 in Wellampitiya.
The CAA estimates the value of seized contraband at around Rs 15.7 million. These fake creams could have resulted in skin issues and injuries.Thanks to our alert CAA officers, we prevented it, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said. I commend CAA and the two CAA investigation officers who successfully completed this risky task. The CAA teams found the same cream in bulk were re-packaged into smaller retail packs of different Commercial Brands, Golden Pearl, Pai Me and Goree (Made in Pakistan), among others.

From captains to principals
My mango friend from Melbourne, Prasanna de Silva features in this weeks article. His writing talents has always being excellent but luckily for me, he has not seriously thought about writing, may he keep to his lecturing duties at the Royal Melbourne Institute as long as he wishes.
Prasanna has written a splendid article called From Captains To Principals on my book called Saga of the Maroons. He mentions in the article as follows, If a schoolboy at either Ananda or Nalanda or for that matter any other school in Sri Lanka, there may not be a greater honor than to captain the School 1st XI cricket team. He is also of the view that nothing prepares one better for future management roles than to be a captain of your schools cricket team which hones ones leadership skills together with planning and executing operations on a constantly changing scenario.
Prasanna states that Colonel Perusinghe carried his aura of his cricketing prowess as a schoolboy to his days at Ananda as Principal. His mere presence was an inspiration to them. During his time as a student, he was not only a swashbuckling opening batsman, he was an exceptional all round sportsman, excelling in Athletics, Soccer and Hockey and to put the icing on the cake he was brilliant in his studies as well. He and his opening partner wicket- keeper batsman R.W.de Silva was a much feared combination for the opposing teams. Prasanna recalls that he was intimated by the old timers that if there was limited over cricket at that time, these two would have walked into any team, the reason being they use to score at a gallop.
Prasanna reminisces that Colonel Perusinghe and P.M. Jayatilake differed in physical stature, P.M. being a broad shouldered six footer against the diminutive Perusinghe; both were passionate about their commitment to excellence and love of cricket. Both were teachers not by choice but by chance. Colonel Perusinghe was a medical student before changing track to a career in Education. Mr P.M. Jayatilake was a brilliant student at Nalanda, from where he entered the University. Prasanna states that joining the prestigious Ceylon Civil Service would have been in his grasp, but he too opted for a career in Teaching.
P.M. Jayatilaka captained the Nalanda team in 1928 and was the first ever centurion of the Ananda-Nalanda series scoring 111 not out. This score was the record for an individual score, until Bandula Warnapura bettered it in 1972. Prasanna recalls an interesting incident about P.M. Jayatilake, when P.M. had his first appointment as an Assistant Teacher at St. Peters College. At the time there had been an annual cricket match between the staff and the students.
The boys and even most of the other teachers were not aware of PMJs cricketing prowess, and the boys have mockingly asked, Sir, sir are you also going to play in the match and his answer had been yes why not, we should try everything and see, shouldnt we The boys had found this most amusing as in their eyes Cricket was played in English! (Prasanna states that surprisingly this type of aping the Sudda attitude or misconception prevailed even up to the early sixties.) The boys have been highly amused and the word went around that the Sinhalaya was also going to play cricket. However their amusement has turned to amazement when the Sinhalaya walked into bat at no 7 and started pelting fours and sixes right around the ground! From that day onwards the students viewed him with more regard and respect and a subtle message was conveyed that one should not prejudge others on preconceived assumptions states Prasanna.
P.M. Jayatilake and Colonel Perusinghe were two of the finest products of Nalanda and Ananda respectively. They have not only done us proud as excellent cricketers and educationalists. They have left us a legacy to emulate. Prasanna stresses the fact that they have not had even the tiniest speck of improper conduct or blemish in their long and illustrious careers.
The achievements of these two gentlemen are unmatched in the history of the two schools and to cap it all they were the byproducts of our revered former Principal Dr P de S Kularatne, coconcludes Prasanna.

Celebrating her
The Womans Day is here, finally. It is a celebratory occasion for women across the world. For some, of course, this is a day that hardly makes any impact on women who actually suffer from male dominance. For SAARC Cultural Centre, however, the Womans Day makes a gesture to celebrate the ladies who ignited the world without complaining about darkness.
The Womans Day is about inspiration passed on from the iconic lady artistes to young generation of females, notes SAARC Cultural Centre Deputy Director of Programmes, Kishani Jayasinghe. It is the right day to do something to honour the ladies who have done something to Sri Lankas cultural landscape.
SAARC Cultural Centre Documentation Officer,
Mahinda SumanasekaraPictures by Sarath Peries
SAARC Cultural Centre
Deputy Director of Programmes,
Kishani Jayasinghe
The iconic ladies: Irangani Serasinghe, Nanda Malini, Sumithra Peries, Vajira Chitrasena and Mary Anne David will be honoured at the Lionel Wendt on March 8 at 7 pm. Sri Lankas only female president Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga will grace the occasion as the chief guest. The event is open only for the invitees. The invites could be obtained from the SAARC Cultural Centre office.
We hope they will honour us with their presence. These iconic figures are not just artistes. They are performers too. They are also teachers. Teachers who have shared their knowledge! They have been sharing experience and educating the younger generation, Kishani says.
A lady or two will deliver a talk on the stage. Another will enlighten the audience with a tale of success and inspiration. In the meanwhile, Thuryaa, an all-female ensemble, will take the centrestage with their performances.
Thuryaa is really something to celebrate as they are all females. They are a professional group of all young ladies from University of Visual Arts and Performance. They have taken a step towards making it their own theme. We will have four items from them. We are really honoured to have them join us.
Kishani Jayasinghe observes the whole procedure as a symbolic commemoration.
Culture matters in everything we do. This is an equal opportunity, whether it is male or female. When it comes to art, we give all the women an opportunity. I suppose we have a traditional Womans Day to highlight that theme. As a woman I think we should have a Womans Day everyday.
Anything starts with a conversation, Kishani believes. Our cultural identity, historical accuracy, our responsibility as artistes as citizens is important.
Let us shake off the carpet and talk about what is current. As long as I am concerned, it gives us an opportunity to evaluate who we are as a society. I am a Sri Lankan woman born and raised in Colombo. We have an artistic license to interpret something in our own. My cultural identity is always Sri Lankan.
Sri Lanka is a developing country where you will still find people struggling for food and water. In such a case would art and culture flourish Most critics are quick to cite Sri Lanka as a cultural desert for that matter. Kishani Jayasinghe, on the contrary, opines that the small isle like no other flourishes in culture and arts.
True, when we have our basic needs, it is easier to listen to the other. It is easier to talk about music. As artists, our job is to try to make it happen. Then people and society can appreciate culture in a better perspective, Jayasinghe maintains, adding that we are a nation of civilized culture.
It depends on where you look, Kishani stresses in a bid to drive her point home.
There are many developments. We have our own university for visual arts. We did not have a particular educational institute devoted to promote culture and arts. And now we should do more to bring back that golden age of art and culture, Jayasinghe notes.
But do we have enough of it Can we never have had enough of it Raising those apparent questions, Kishani Jayasinghe emhpasises the need to encourage more arts and culture in a country like Sri Lanka.
Traditionally speaking, we have a natural lenience towards academic prowess. Parents urge children to opt for traditional professions of doctors, engineers and lawyers. Kishani Jayasinghe feels lucky because her family did not force her on any career. Besides, her family had interests in music and other arts.
We must do what we can do as much as possible. There are great professors and lecturers willing to support culture and arts. There are many academics and university deans who contribute to arts. They are all working hard. I certainly believe I became an artiste because I loved it. My family had a great interest in music and arts. I had the support. I was lucky perhaps. Initial love for arts and music means so much. It encourages us to give more to the people. We will then be able to reach the rest of the regional arts, Kishani Jayasinghe said.
Mahinda Sumanasekara, Documentation Officer at the SAARC Cultural Centre, recalled the highlights of the Womans Day celebrations in 2016. It was a stage play titled as Baawre Mann ke Sapne by Indian director Ramanjith Kaur with the whole cast consisted of female artistes.
It was a national award-winning all-women theatre production. Kaur had a dream and motive to create awareness about giving formal and systematic theatre training to young girls. It was mostly based on the works of Indian lady authors such as Jhumpa Lahiri, Bulbul Sharma, Abha Lyengaer, Irene Dhar Malik and Lalitambika Antarjanam.
It was totally a different new experience to the Sri Lankan audience. I think that offered a fresh message to the audience in general: Womans Day is actually worth celebrating, because their participation in shaping the society is now becoming instrumental, Sumanasekara said.
The play explored tradition, scepticism, collective responsibilities and individual choice along with other intricate themes of caste and hierarchy relationships.
The art of percussion has traditionally belonged to the domain of men. Thuryaa brings a feminine touch and a definitive beat without boundaries, changing the face of drumming. Embracing rhythm, creating, and mixing art, their quest began within the walls of the University of the Visual and Performance Arts in Colombo, with nine talented undergraduate souls, created by Sithara, the first female percussion graduate of the University. Embracing the essences of Kandyan, low country, and Sabaragamuwa - the tri-tradition of the Sri Lankan percussion art, they mix international percussion music to their presentation. The inspirational and innovative efforts of Thuryaa creates an entertaining and unique cultural performance.

Chambers raise concern  on China - Sri Lanka FTA
Request government not to reduce the negative list to 10% from 30% and not to phase out CESS within five years
Several Chambers and Trade Associations related to Commerce and Industry, said local industrialists are worried about the proposed China - Sri Lanka FTA negotiations.
They are cautioning the government of possible adverse economic impacts to the domestic industry.In a statement issued by the National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) after a recent meeting held among them they highlighted that the Government has earlier requested recommendations of the Chambers to reduce the said negative list to 30% which had initially been at 40.21% of the total tariff lines.
They request the government not to reduce the negative list to 10% from the present level which has already been agreed as 30% and not to phase out CESS within a period of five years, which is the only measure available to safeguard the local industries.
The proposed Free Trade Agreement (FTA) between Sri Lanka and China has become a point for discussion in various circles among the industrial sector today. The main reason is that the Government has recently disclosed their requirement of reducing the Sri Lanka negative list to 10 % and to phase out the import CESS to zero within five years after implementation of the proposed FTA.
However, the latest scenario is to reduce the Sri Lankan Negative list to 10% and to remove the CESS which has been imposed to safeguard the Sri Lankan industries within five years upon implementing the proposed FTA.
This is a situation which needs serious attention of the industrial sector. At a time where the worlds most developed country is considering to impose tariff and tax for imports from China, it is imprudent for our country to relax safeguards for our industries.
WTO recognises the need for adopting safeguarding measures for protection of domestic industries as para tariffs imposed to achieve this objective. Phasing out the para tariffs, such as CESS, will be a death knell, leading to the closure of our local industries.
Large economies enjoy the benefits of economies of scale while local industries are burdened with high energy, high labour, inflated raw material costs, facing an un-levelled playing field, causing non-competitiveness.
Sri Lankan industrial sector is dominated by SMEs which accounts for 90% of the total industrial establishments.During the nearly three decades of terrorism, this sector has been the back-bone of the nation and sustained the economy, despite all the adversities, surmounting all local and global challenges.
These SMEs are dependent on large industries for backward/forward integration for supply sourcing of raw materials, marketing and other services. Removal of tariff protection, will adversely affect these SMEs, both directly and indirectly which will lead to their non-competitiveness and closing down, creating unemployment and adversely affecting the economy.
The majority of the local industrialists have funded their investments, in their respective industries, with borrowed funds, from banks and financial institutions, using their personal assets as security.
Sri Lanka is lacking in strong economic fundamentals to develop and safeguard the local industries; such areas are high bank interest rates, non- competitive parity rate for our rupee, effective labour laws focused on improving productivity and problems relating to conflicting investment policies
It was the consensus among all present that they were not in agreement to this FTA at all. No local industrialist seems to be in need of an FTA between Sri Lanka and China other than a very few in certain selected industries.
It was also the view of those present at the meeting that the criteria for entering into such FTAs, should be the sustenance, growth and development of the Sri Lankan economy.
The importance of safeguarding local industries can be very evidently seen today; even in USA which is considered to be the largest economy in the world.
The business community of Sri Lanka, has rejected these proposals completely and requests the government to extend BOI facilities, for investments in manufacturing facilities in Sri Lanka, that are of strategic importance and add-value, contributing to economic development and prosperity of the nation and its people.
Therefore, they earnestly request the government not to reduce the negative list to 10% from the present level which has already been agreed as 30% and not to phase out CESS within a period of five years, which is the only measure available to safeguard the local industries.

China hints  at changing  yuan policy
China has hinted at changing its long-standing yuan policy to liberalise its currency against the dollar, signalling willingness to alter course on exchange rates.
For the first time in an annual government report, China included the requirement to ensure the stable global status of yuan as one of its major tasks, dropping the line keeping a stable yuan at a reasonable and balanced level which was included in the previous three reports, Hong Kong-based South China Morning Post reported.
In his lengthy work report submitted to Chinas National Peoples Congress (NPC) Chinese Premier Li Keqiang said the renminbi exchange rate will be further liberalised, and the currencys stable position in the global monetary system will be maintained.
The new wording may indicate that Beijing will be more tolerant of yuan exchange rate moves against the dollar and gradually reduce its intervention in the foreign exchange market this year, the Post report said. (The Hindu)

Invest in schools, not prisons
President Maithripala Sirisena has recently turned down an invitation to open a prison complex at Angunakolapalessa. The prison is a luxurious one, so we hear. The president is recorded to have said that he would not willingly take part in any such occasion. President Sirisena expressed these sentiments at the 150th anniversary of St Marys College, Kegalle. When he emphasized that he would open schools but not prisons, it naturally brings us to Victor Hugos celebrated maxim: He who opens a school door, closes a prison.
While applauding President Sirisena for his bravery in issuing such a statement, we cannot help recalling the horrendous incidents that has been plaguing this beautiful island. Mondays killing of seven persons is latest in the scene.
It goes without saying that the prison is where criminals are quarantined for punishment. Imprisonment is a measure to avoid a criminal from committing the same mistake over and over again. But then why make it lavish Is it to encourage being imprisoned Or is it a new decision taken to cheer up the politicians arrested for their malpractices If that is the case, of course a luxurious prison complex makes sense. But it is not the case when it comes to law and order in a society. Prisons are not meant to be encouraging. A luxurious prison complex indirectly encourages the criminals, need I say more And that beckons danger to a civilized social order.
I doff my hat to your bold statement, President Sirisena. At the same time, I keep my fingers crossed that you would take a bold initiative against the increasing crime rate of this country.

Constitutional protection of human rights
An important judgement in the field of education was delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in 2007.In the absence of the right to education asa fundamental right in our present Constitution, the Supreme Court applied the fundamental rightto equality (Article 12 of the Constitution) as discussed above to provethe infringement of the childs right to educationby the education authorities of the State. The petitioners in this case allegedinfringements of theirfundamental rightsguaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution
Equality is a new frontier of judicial activism in Sri Lanka. The guarantees of equality provided by Article 12 of the Sri Lankan Constitution of 1978 to a considerable extent, resemble corresponding provisions in the Indian Constitution (Articles 14 and 15). The early phase of jurisprudence of the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka relating to equality revolved the traditional doctrine of reasonable classification mainly developed by the US Supreme Court. The Palihawadana judgement (1979) marks a dismal beginning for fundamental rights jurisprudence of the Sri Lankan Supreme Court. By embracing the new doctrine on equality evolved by the Indian Supreme Court, the Sri Lankan Supreme Court infused a new dimension to the guarantee of equal protection of the law by pronouncing that it embraces the right to public administrative justice-to be free from a caprice of arbitrary executive or administrative action.
In India, a new orientation has been given to Article 14 of the Indian Constitution (which corresponds to our Artcle 12) by the Supreme Court of India, The Supreme Court of India for the first time laid down in Royappas case in 1974 a new dimension of Article 14. It was Justice Bhagawathi who first propounded this new doctrine. The claim was repeated in Maneka Gandhi v. Union of India (1978); Ramana v. International Airport Authority of India (1979); Ajay Hasia v. Khalid Mujib (1981). In Hasias case the claim was formulated thus;
Equality is a dynamic concept with many aspects and dimensions and it cannot be cribbed, cabined & confined within traditional and doctrinaire limits. From a positivistic point of view, equality is antithetic to arbitrariness
Article 12 of the 1978 Constitution of Sri Lanka allows a reasonable classification. The grounds referred to in Article12 (2) cannot be valid basis of classification. The Article specifically bars the State from discriminating against any citizen on any of those grounds. Article 12 (1) offers equality to all persons in which the right to equality is generally stated. On the other hand, Article 12 (2) is applicable to citizens only and therefore it is an instance and particular application of the right of equality which is generally stated in Article12 (1). If discrimination is alleged on a ground other than those specified in Article 12 (2), the case must be decided under the general Article 12 (1).
Article 12 (2) specifies the institutionalised grounds on which discrimination against any citizen is prohibited, including race, religion, language caste, sex , political opinion, place of birth or any one of such grounds. Article 12(3) prohibits discrimination in the form of any disability, liability, restriction or condition with regard to access to shops, public restaurants, hotels, places of public entertainment, and places of public worship of a persons own religion. Finally Article 12(4) permits special provision being made by law, subordinate legislation or executive action, for the advancement of women, children or disabled person.
Scope of the Right to Education in the Sri Lankan Constitution
Chapter III of the 1978 Constitution lists out a number of fundamental rights including right to equality freedom of speech, and freedom from torture and so on. But not a word about education.
By Article 27(2) (h) of the 1978 Constitution under Chapter VI  Directive Principles of State Policy ( DPSP) the State is pledged to the complete eradication of illiteracy and the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels, but free education is not stipulated; not the right to non-State education. The content and quality of education is not stipulated, but Article 27(13) calls upon the State to ensure the full development of children and youth, and that must include education in its widest sense and of reasonable quality. However, Article 29 of 1978 Constitution provides that these DPSP do not create legal rights or obligations and are not enforceable in any court or tribunal, and that no question of inconsistency shall be raised in any court or tribunal. It follows from the above that the right to education is not a fundamental right justiciable under our present Constitution.
The Case Law from Sri Lanka
q R Haputhantrige & Others v. Secretary, Ministry of Education & Others (2007 FR) 10-13/2007 (Grade One Admission case) (2007) 1 Sri LR 101.
An important judgment in the field of education was delivered by the Supreme Court of Sri Lanka in 2007. In the absence of the right to education as a fundamental right in our present Constitution, the Supreme Court applied the fundamental right to equality (Article 12 of the Constitution) as discussed above to prove the infringement of the childs right to education by the education authorities of the State. The petitioners in this case alleged infringements of their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution.
The alleged infringements were in respect of the refusal to admit the several children named in the petitions to Grade I of respective National Schools. The allegations have related to unequal, arbitrary and capricious application of the relevant circulars resulting in less suited children securing admission to the detriment of the children who have been thereby compelled to invoke the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court.
The underlying cause of this pervasive malady is the ever increasing demand for admission to the leading schools in Colombo and other principal cities administratively designated as National Schools within the purview of the Central Government. The response of the authorities to this classic situation of a gross mismatch in supply and demand has been to narrow down, through an intricate system of criteria contained in circulars, the area that would feed a particular school described in the circular as the feeder area of the school.
The petitioners made applications for the admission of their respective children to the Sujatha Vidyalaya, Matara on the basis of Circular No. 20 of 2006 dated 23.05.2006 issued by the 10th Respondent, being the Secretary of Ministry of Education, titled Admission of Children to Schools. Petitioners admittedly reside within close proximity of the Sujatha Vidyalaya and their common complaint was that on the elaborate system of assigning marks they in fact received sufficient marks to secure admission of their children.
However, 30 other children, residing further away secured admission depriving Petitioners children of their due places in view of a decision of the Respondents to assign 15 marks to each child who was born at the Matara Hospital. As a result Petitioners children fell below the cut off point giving an undue advantage to children who were born in the Matara hospital.
The Supreme Court having reviewed the Circular in question found that the classification in the Circular was not based on the suitability and the need of a particular child to receive education in a national school or any other State school.
The classification was based on according to the Court wholly extraneous considerations such as the residence of the parents to be ascertained from the ownership of the property, whether the parent is a past pupil and if so for what period and his achievements, whether the child to be admitted has a brother or sister in the school and if so brothers or sisters achievements or whether the parent has been transferred in the manner referred to therein. The suitability and the need of the particular student to receive education in the school is not ascertained in the process, no is there any method and criteria specified to ascertain such matters. The Court also noted that the system of weighted marking as contained in the Circular completely defects the objective of providing equal access to education.
The Supreme Court examined the grounds urged from the ambit of the fundamental right to equality guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution. According the Court the Preamble of the Constitution states the immutable republican principles on which it is based as being Representative Democracy and the assurance to all people Freedom, Equality, Justice, Fundamental Human Rights and the Independence of the Judiciary. These principles partake of Democracy and Socialism being the components of the name of the Republic.
As noted by the Supreme Court, the law in its primary sense of an Ordinance or Enactment of the legislature related to Education is contained in the Education Ordinance originally proclaimed in 1939, prior to the granting of independence. According to the Supreme Court a perusal of the provisions of the Ordinance reveals that these provisions have mostly fallen into disuse.
A similar observation was made by the Court as regards the exhaustive regulations that have been made under the Ordinance. Here the regulations refer to those in operation at the time of the judgment. The Education Ordinance established the Department of the Education as the central authority for education which function under the general direction and control of the Minister.
As noted by the Supreme Court in the judgement, the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, inter alia provides for the devolution of power to Provincial Councils. In terms of section 3 of List 1 in the 9th Schedule to the 13th Amendment, Education and Educational Services to the extent set out in Appendix III are devolved to Provincial Councils.
Right to equality
Section 1 of Appendix 111 states that the provision of facilities to all State schools other than specified schools shall be the responsibility of the Provincial Council. It is therefore provided that specified schools will be National Schools.
The concept of national schools derives solely from its single reference to it in Appendix III. Almost all leading government schools have been declared as being National Schools. According to the Supreme Court, the Education Ordinance has not been amended to provide for the newly emerged situation and there is no specific law that is operative as regards National Schools or for that matter.
The Supreme Court examined the content of the right to equality in order to form a basis to judge the alleged infringement in this case. Accordingly, the Supreme Court referred to Dr. Wickremaratne (Fundamental Rights in Sri Lanka  2006 2nd Ed. at p 286) citing from the renowned exponent of Socialism, Harold Laski (A Grammer of Politics), Justice C.G Weeramantry and the Judgment of Brewer J., sums up the concept of equality and the manner in which the equal protection of law applies, as follows:
Equality, as Laski stated, does not mean identity of treatment. There can be no ultimate identity of treatment so long as men are different in want and capacity and need. Men are unequal in strength, talent and other attributes. While some of these are natural, others are referable to the society in which they live. Some are born with advantages. Other factors and combinations of factors may favour some people and place others at a disadvantage. To quote Weeramantry:
As the myriads of constituent units of a society keep thus shifting their positions relative to each other, absolute equality among (men) even in one characteristic of for a moment of time is patently an impossibility. Far greater is the impossibility of preserving general equality for any period, however short.
A permanent state of equality is only the remotest dream.
Equal protection does not mean that all persons are to be treated alike in all circumstances. It means that persons who are similarly circumstanced must be similarly treated. The State is however permitted to make laws that are unequal and to take unequal administrative action when dealing with persons who are placed in different circumstances and situations.
Thus the State has the right to classify persons and place those who are substantially similar under the same rule of law while applying different rules to persons differently situated. A classification should not be irrational or arbitrary. It must be reasonable and based on some real and substantial distinction, which bears a reasonable and just relation to the act in respect of which the classification is proposed can never be made arbitrary and without any such basis.
The Supreme Court also stated that the requirement stated by Brewer J., in the case of Gulf Colarado and Santa Railway Co. v Ethis has been subsequently stated as the Basic standard to be satisfied in a permissible classification. The Supreme Court applied the classic formulation of the basic standard stated in the case Royster Guano Co. v. Commonwealth of Virginia (1920) at page 415. It reads as follows:
Classification must be reasonable not arbitrary and must rest upon some ground of differences having a fair and substantial relation to the object of the legislation, so that all persons similarly circumstanced shall be treated alike.
The Supreme Court stated that the broad phrase National Policy appearing at the top List 11 should be interpreted with the relevant provisions in Chapter VI of the 1978 Constitution which contains the Directive Principles of State Policy. The limitation in Article 29 which states that the provisions of Chapter VI are not justiciable would not in the view of the Court be a bar against the use of these provisions to interpret other provisions of the Constitution. Article 27 of Chapter VI lays down that the Directive Principles of State Policy contained therein shall guide Parliament, the President and the Cabinet of Ministers in the enactment of the laws and the governance of Sri Lanka for the establishment of a just and free society.
As regards education, the policy objective as referred to by the Court is stated in Article 27(2) (h) of the Chapter VI of the 1978 Constitution which is not justiciable under Article 29 of the 1978 Constitution as follows:
The State is pledged to establish in Sri Lanka a democratic socialist society, the objective of which include -  (h) the complete eradication of literacy and the assurance to all persons of the right to universal and equal access to education at all levels.
The Supreme Court also stated that equal opportunity in the matter of education was held by the Supreme Court of the United States to be requirement of the Equal Protection Clause (Similar to Article 12 of our Constitution) of the 14th Amendment to the US Constitution. The Supreme Court also referred to the judgment, Brown v Board of Education Topika where the Chief Justice Warren delivering the opinion of the Court stated as follows:
Today, education is perhaps the most important function of the State and the local governments. Compulsory school attendance laws and the great expenditures for education both demonstrate our recognition of the importance of education to our democratic society. It is required in the performance of our most basic responsibilities, even service in the armed forces. It is the very foundation of good citizenship. Today it is a principle instrument in awakening the child to cultural values in preparing him for later professional training and in helping him to adjust normally to his environment. In these days, it is doubtful that any child may reasonably be expected succeed in life if he is denied the opportunity of an education. Such an opportunity where the State has undertaken to provide it, is a right which must be right made available to all on equal terms.
Access to education
The Supreme Court stated that the classification in the Circular in question is not based on the suitability and the need of a particular child to receive education in a National School or any other State school. The classification underlying the Circular in question is based on wholly extraneous considerations. Similarly the system of weighted marking referred to as contained in the Circular completely defeats the objective of providing equal access to education. Therefore the Supreme Court held that the Circular in question applicable in the matter of admission of students is inconsistent with the fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution, in so far as it relates to the admission of students to Grade I of National Schools and other schools to which the Circular has been made applicable.
As noted by the Supreme Court the authorities have failed over the decades that elapsed to provide an effective legal machinery to manage, regulate and supervise education. The Ministry of Education appeared to have formulated the Circular as the purported national policy outside the framework of the law, which fact by itself would suffice to declare invalid. Section 2 of the National Education Commission Act No.19 of 1991 empowers the President to declare from time to time the national education policy which shall be conformed to by all authorities and institutions responsible for education in all its aspects. The policy is formulated on the recommendations and advice of the Commission and in terms of section 2(2) includes, inter alia:  . Methods and criteria for admission of students.
In the view of the Supreme Court, this is the proper guideline for the formulation of a policy. The Ministry fell into error by laying down classifications, quotas and a system of weighted marking being elements completely antithetic to the guarantee of equality before the law whereas the focus should be on appropriate methods and criteria that would apply in the process of effecting admissions.
In the situation that has arisen, the Supreme Court was of the view that it is appropriate for immediate action to be taken in terms of the National Education Commission Act for the formulation of a policy setting out methods and criteria for admission of students. Therefore the Supreme Court decided that the existing situation has resulted in a gross abuse of the process of admission of students. In the circumstances it would be necessary to device a new process in which the participation of authorities who have brought about the tragic situation be excluded and the process to be administered directly under the purview of the President as provided in the National Education Commission Act.
Therefore, the Supreme Court held that;
(1) The national policy of school admission to be formulated may be submitted to the Court for the policy to be examined from the perspective of the fundamental right to equality before the law and the equal protection of the law guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the 1978 Constitution.
(2) S.C applications 10 to 13  2007 are allowed and the petitioners are granted the Declaration that their fundamental rights guaranteed by Article 12(1) of the Constitution have been infringed by executive and administrative action.
(3) It is further declared that the Circular in question is inconsistent with Article 12(1) of the Constitution and is invalid and of no force or avail in law in respect of admission of students to Grade I in the schools to which the Circular is addressed.
 Seneviratne v. University Grants Commission, (1978-80)
Seneviratne v University Grants Commission concerned admission to universities. In this case the scheme of admission to the Universities provided for 55% of the places available to be distributed on the basis of the ratio of population among the 24 administrative districts; 15% of the places were to be apportioned at the discretion of the University Grants Commission among 13 districts which were considered to be underprivileged and 30% of the places were to be decided solely on merit. The challenge was directed to the said allocation of the 55%. The petitioner relied on the judgment of the Supreme Court of India in Rajendran v. State of Madras, (1968) S.C. 1012. In that case, the Supreme Court of India struck down a rule which laid down district wise distribution of seats in the State Medical College on the basis of the ratio of the population of each district to the total population of the State. It was pointed out that there was no nexus between such distribution and the object to be achieved viz. admission of best talent among the candidates. Fixation of district-wise quota on the ratio of the district population to the total state population for admission to the State Medical College is discriminatory.
Basically any district quota is discriminatory, for quota means that as between two candidates of equal merits coming from two different districts the candidate belonging to one district is preferred to the other, just because he comes from the wrong district whose quota is filled up. Deserving candidates will be frustrated by reservation for the less deserving persons. The test applied to adjudge the validity of any reservation is whether it is based on any rational and relevant principle.
The respondent University Grants Commission submitted to Court that by reason of the educational-socio-economic circumstances of Sri Lanka and the unequal secondary educational facilities provided mainly by the government, the determination of entry to the Universities based solely on the aggregate of raw marks of a candidate cannot be accepted as the sole criterion for higher education.
Wanasundera, J. upholding the classification stated that the increasing number of students pressing for admission and the woeful lack of teachers and facilities in most of the provinces had compelled the authorities to modify the merit principle to meet the ends of justice. The departure from the merit principle, though unfortunate, is inevitable. He referred to, with approval, Kesavananda Bharati v. State of Kerala and State of Kerala v Thomas where the Indian Supreme Court had given the Directive Principles a place of honor in the Constitution-they constitute the conscience of the Constitution.
Referring the Bakkes case which was referred to above, Justice Wanasundara observed that the US Supreme Courts decisions of the last few decades on racial questions had been undoubtedly progressive but Bakke seemed to indicate the prospect of another shift in the judicial thinking of the Court. His Lordship referred to the close decision of the court on two main issues before it and said that Bakke seemed to be in the nature of a trial of strength between the libertarian element on the one hand and conservative element on the other of the Supreme Court, with the result left indecisive.
 Perera v University Grants Commission  FRD (1) 103
In this case the petitioner challenged a policy decision in the matter of selection for admission to the University courses in Bio- Sciences in 1980. There were two separate Advanced Level Examinations in April and August 1979 held on two separate sets of syllabus.
The University Grants Commission decided to adopt a system of allocating the available places to students passing the two examinations in proportion to the numbers attaining the minimum requirement for admission at each examination. A ratio of 7.2: 2.8 was thus adopted. This classification would easily satisfy the first criterion (that is if the classification is based on an intelligible differentia which distinguishes those grouped together from those left out), as the two groups are clearly identifiable, that is those who sat the two separate examinations.
The question was whether the classification was rationally related to the objective of selecting the best students. The Supreme Court held that by the decision to have a common basic aggregate in both examinations, eligibles from both sources were integrated into one class and thereby made equals. Thereafter, they cannot be discriminated against by reference to the original sources. There were no material available to show that one examination was superior. The Court quashed the impugned basis of selection and ordered that admissions be made out of an integrated or consolidated list.
Draft Constitution of 2000
Since 1995, Sri Lanka has been witnessing the making of a new Constitution premised on democracy and enhancing power sharing between different communities. The latest set of proposal on constitutional reform in the form of a Draft Constitution was released by the then Government in 2000. Although this Draft Constitution could not proceed with due to certain circumstances, the comparison of its fundamental right chapter with that of the 1978 Constitution reveals considerable improvements in Draft Constitution.
In the field of economic, social and cultural rights, the Draft fundamental chapter embodies special rights of children (Article 22) including the right of access to free education for every child between the ages of 5 and 14 years (Article 22(6)), the right to ownership of property (Article 21), social rights (Article 25) including access to health care services, sufficient food and water and social assistances as justiciable fundamental rights. In addition right to life (Article 8) and right to equality (Article 11) were also included in it. The inclusion of the aforesaid rights in the Draft Constitution is step in the right direction.
The Draft Constitution of 2000 allows for judicial review of legislation in Sri Lanka for the first time since such a power was inferred under the Soulbury Constitution of 1947. Moreover Article 30(1)(c) of the Draft Constitution also broaden the scope of public interest litigation. Moreover under the 1978 Constitution a fundamental right claim could be made only against violation of administrative and executive action. (Articles 17 and 126 (2)). In the Draft Constitution of 2000 it has been expanded to cover state action. These are very salutary developments in terms of substantive rights and enforcement of such rights compared to the 1978 Constitution.
Therefore this study recommends as also endorsed by the Report of the Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reforms, the incorporation of judicial review of legislation and justiciable economic, social and cultural rights including a right to education in the proposed Constitution for the proper constitutional governance.

DFCC Bank launches staff tree planting initiative as part of CSR drive
As part of its long-term sustainability and CSR drive, DFCC Bank recently launched a commemorative staff tree-planting initiative where a tree is planted to celebrate each and every staff members birthday.
Additional trees are also planted at key sites, where reforestation is a priority and these programmes are carried out in collaboration with Reforest Lanka, a non-profit society committed to the protection and extension of forest cover in Sri Lanka.
Staff members whose birthdays are celebrated each month receive a personalised invitation to attend the tree-planting campaign. They also receive an e-tree dedication certificate after the tree planting campaign which provides the link to find the exact location of the planted tree on Google Maps.
In January the DFCC Bank planted a total of 960 trees in Aranayake, 160 of which were planted to commemorate staff birthdays in January.
Furthermore, to coincide with Independence Day celebrations, a further 1,000 trees were planted alongside the Kaduwela Kadawatha Highway, out of which 100 seedlings were planted in commemoration of staff birthdays in February. In addition, DFCC Bank will plant 1,000 trees at the University of Jaffna during the latter part of February.
These tree-planting programmes were attended by staff members and their families, as well as members of the local community, who came together to support the Banks initiative.
Commenting on the initiative, Arjun Fernando, CEO DFCC Bank, said, I would like to extend my congratulations to the DFCC Sustainability Unit and the entire team for successfully launching this initiative.
In a short period of time, we have planted approximately 2,000 trees and actively engaged team members at every level of our organisation.
The trees planted will help to reforest key areas across the island, whilst giving back to the planet at large. The trees will help to improve soil quality in the areas and minimise soil erosion, whilst returning much-needed oxygen to the environment.

Ekala Surakeeme Sanvidhanaya to meet religious leaders over garbage issue
The Members of the Ekala Surakeeme Sanvidhanaya (Association formed to Protect Interests of Ekala Polity) will meet His Eminence Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith, the Archbishop of Colombo and Most Venerable Kotugoda Dhammavasa Thera, the Prelate of the Amarapura Sect, of the Amarapura Chapter to ascertain the future of the Ekala residents who have registered their protest over the attempts of the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage at Ekala, Jaela.
While appreciating the support of the media let the authorities open their eyes to stark realities Ven. Dhammaseeha, the incumbent monk of Dharmodaya Buddhist Centre, Ekala told the media.
Members of the Association with the Members of the Eksath Welenda Sangamaya, Ja-ela would also be meeting the Secretary of the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat in the coming week. We have come to know that President Maithripala Sirisena has assured via telephone both the Cardinal and the Prelate of Amarapura Chapter that steps would not be taken to move the Meethotamulla garbage to Othe-Onaagama, Ekala. We will learn more about this when we meet both His Eminence and the Most Ven. Prelate in the coming week, they said.
The Chief of the Ekala Dharmodaya Centre told the media that through numerous meetings and communications via letters the Association had informed the authorities concerned the unsuitability of the land ear-marked by the Colombo Municipal Council to dump the Meethotamulla garbage. The Ja-ela Development Committee and even the Secretary of the Ja-ela Divisional Secretariat have pointed out in clear terms the unsuitability of the land chosen to dump garbage and in spite of their protest if steps were taken to dump the garbage, that would cause multiple health problems and cause a big calamity, not having good water resources for drinking and cooking.
In our letters and discussion we have told the authorities concerned that if the area ear-marked comes under heavy rain just for one hour, the whole area would get flooded and would go under water disturbing and preventing vehicular and peoples movements. During the last flooding, over 11,000 residents of the area had to be assisted and provided with dry rations as the area went under water. Things would be worse if garbage is dumped, the Ven. Thera added.

## Title: Eliminating non-tariff measures on  Sri Lanka affecting trade within SAARC

Eliminating non-tariff measures on  Sri Lanka affecting trade within SAARC
With the worlds growing demand for an efficient trade increase with new changing industries particularly in South Asia, improving the efficiency of international trade by reducing the burden of NTMs is becoming increasingly important.
At present, NTMs have created significant legal and regulatory obstacles to market access, hurting the competitiveness of exporters and delaying (and sometimes even preventing) businesses from entering into new markets and taking advantages of new opportunities.
SAARC  NTM Desk of Sri Lanka was instituted at Federation of Chambers of Commerce and Industry of Sri Lanka (FCCISL) to identify Non  Tariff Measures and Non  Tariff Barriers (NTBs) which exist and restricts trade between Sri Lanka and rest of the SAARC Countries.
The objective of the desk is to identify the NTMs and NTBs and to propose recommendations to regulators of trade and commerce to take counter measures to reduce these barriers.
The NTM Desk has identified products which Sri Lanka could increase in exports into SAARC Countries including traditional exports such as spices and rubber. Furthermore, it was identified floriculture and ornamental fish as potential exports and imports to Sri Lanka in 2020 including fresh fruits, fruit juices and apparel products that were identified as part of SAARC regional value chains by SAARC TPN.
The NTM Desk of FCCISL together with Karpos Consultants carried out series of forums, interviews and field visits to understand the issues faced by the selected sectors on Non-tariff measures affecting when trading within SAARC region.
It was clearly understood that non-tariff measures (NTMs) continue to create major challenges for exporters, importers and policymakers. Defined as policy measures other than ordinary customs tariffs that can potentially have an economic effect on international trade in goods, changing quantities traded, or prices or both, there is a wide spectrum of NTMs used in international trade today.
Within the region, India and Sri Lanka enjoy a vibrant and growing economic and commercial partnership with bilateral trade growing rapidly in the last decade and a number of leading Indian private sector companies investing in Sri Lanka and establishing a presence in this country. Sri Lanka is India's largest trade partner in SAARC.
India in turn is Sri Lanka's largest trade partner globally. Much of the impetus for the current level of our economic interaction stemmed from the signing and entering into force of the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) in 1998 and 2000 respectively, While Sri Lankan exports to India have increased substantially during past 12 years since 2000 when ISFTA came into force, they have lagged behind the high growth in Indias exports to Sri Lanka, resulting in a widening of the trade balance.
This is largely because of the lack of export capacity from Sri Lanka to service Indian requirement and also due to increase in imports from India because of competitiveness of our exports. Interestingly, over 80% of our exports to Sri Lanka are outside the list of products covered by the FTA, thereby indicating their overall competitiveness in the Sri Lankan market.
Most of the issues identified and highlighted during the interviews were related to India and Pakistan.
Despite Sri Lanka having FTAs with both countries, the effectiveness of the agreements needs to be revisited. The chamber conducted a series of meetings (focus group meetings) with each sector identified in consultation with trade associations, exporters and importers to find out the persistent NTMs affecting when trading within the region. On February 9 2017, all highlighted trade issues were addressed with the policy makers at the Policy Advocacy Group to verify all issues identified and to seek possible mechanisms to be applied to eliminate barriers. Unfortunately, some of the issues continued to exist for a long time.
However, an effort was made by all representatives of the policy group where most departments confirmed and stated their plans to address most of the NTMs to support trade. We look forward to share all identified NTMs through a publication which will be handed over to Department of Commerce said by the NTM desk from FCCISL.
They further thanked SAARC Trade Promotion Network (SAARC TPN) and (GIZ) GmbH for the project extended to Sri Lanka and to the region in their support to eliminate non-tariff barriers affecting trade with the SAARC countries.

Fake creams worth Rs. 15.7 m found in Kolonnawa warehouse
Officers of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) commenced a probe into one of the largest cosmetics contraband stocks detected at a warehouse in Kolonnawa.
The CAA seized counterfeit cosmetics (mainly skin cream) worth around Rs 15.7 million which if released to the market could have posed a serious health risk for the consumers.
These fake creams could have resulted in skin issues and injuries. CAA officers prevented it, Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen said.
The minister said: I commend two young CAA investigation officers who completed this risky task.
The raid at Kolonnawa warehouse was led by two CAA officials who were tipped off on the illicit operation which was carried out from the warehouse at Wennawatte, Wellampitiya.
The CAA teams had found the same cream in bulk were re-packaged into smaller retail packs of different Commercial Brands-Golden Pearl, Pai Me and Goree (Made in Pakistan), among others.
Some packs of cream were also labeled Seaweed Element-Whitening Anti-Spot Cream in English and priced at Rs 650 each.
Some retail packs were advertised 7 Days Freckle removing on the label as well.
At the warehouse, the CAA found sub-standard creams in bulk packs that were printed in Chinese characters.
There were no import documents or proof of country of origin.
The suspected individual in charge of the operation also failed to produce any documents showing the location of production of the cosmetics (locally or abroad), product registration certificates or even registration numbers (which is also not found in any labels).
The bulk creams were found in new large cardboard boxes, neatly stacked in shelves at the warehouse. In 2014, CAA netted 100,000 fake black henna packets in Grandpass, Colombo. The 100,000 packets were branded and printed showing a locally reputed brand name but the henna inside was switched with a substandard, adulterated dye powder. This stock was valued at Rs 13 million.
In November 2016, the CAA was informed of the use of adulterated and expired cosmetics in many salons around the country. CAA raided 107 beauty and hair salons in Kandy, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Matara, and Puttalam Districts and detected expired cosmetics in 67 salons.
In the wake of the latest detection, the CAA once again warned consumers to be cautious of fake cream products.

Flourishing together
Sri Lanka is Indias second largest trade partner in South Asia, with annual trade of more than US$ 4.6 billion. India and Sri Lanka entered into an FTA in 2000, the first for both countries. Total trade has increased 8 times since then, said Indian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Taranjit Singh Sandhu. He was addressing an event held by the Sri Lanka India Society recently in Colombo to commemorate the Republic Day of India and the Independence Day of Sri Lanka. We are trying to upgrade the FTA to an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). I would like to reiterate here that we will move at a pace Sri Lanka is comfortable with. India is also among the top investors in Sri Lanka with accumulated investments of more than billion dollars in the last 15 years. Investments worth US$ 1 billion are in the pipeline, he said.
Following is the full text of the speech:
Indian High Commissioner Taranjit Singh Sandhu
delivering the speech
It is a privilege to be here this evening and speak to the oldest friendship society in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka India Society, as we celebrate the Republic Day of India and the Independence Day of Sri Lanka. The oldest society to celebrate perhaps the oldest friendship! The name of the magazine which you launched in January 2016 is also just apt, Maithri.
The challenges that we face today as individuals as societies as nations are far too complex to be handled single-handedly. The mutual interdependence is not a sign of weakness; it is a source of strength. It is the friendship that we cherish, the trust that we build, the connectivity that we craft that hold potential solutions to many of those pressing problems that confront todays world.
I see in each one of you an ambassador of peace and friendship. You bring together the best of both countries. Your synergy, how much you are able to add to an already broad and deep partnership will determine when, at what pace, we are able to touch the sky. Touch the sky, we will...I have no doubts on thatYour ability to do so will further depend on how well you understand the two countries and their evolution, of future trajectories of progress.
My vision for India-Sri Lanka relations, at this juncture, involves the 3 Fs:
Focus  Facilitate  Flourish
Focus
The threads that connect India and Sri Lanka are many. From mythology to history to civilizational, cultural, commercial and people-to-people ties, there are layers and layers of what we mean for each other. We have the profound advantage of not having to look hard for similarities and bonds. The question is how to encash these advantages and maximise our mutual benefit
India is perhaps the worlds most intricate and pluralistic society, home to a vast variety of people, tribes, communities, religions, languages, customs and living styles. India is home to all major religions of the world. There are as many as 1,652 languages and dialects which are spoken in India. The People of India project, of the Anthropological Survey of India, estimates there are nearly 4,599 separate communities in India. India has been able to preserve this rich mosaic of pluralism under democratic and federal systems with devolution of powers to the provincial and local level. This is a testimony to the vision of our forefathers and the innate peace-loving nature of our people who value tolerance and spirit of coexistence.
Our Government also has the responsibility to cater to the developmental aspirations of these 1.25 billion people. Our hard efforts have produced results. When CEOs of Fortune-500 companies of top MNCs of the world say that they will bet on India, out of all the countries in the world it is a serious statement. India grew fastest among major economies worldwide at over 7.5 per cent in 2016. India will continue to drive global growth in 2017, and its share in the world GDP is expected to rise to 17 percent.
India has left every other country behind in terms of providing return on investment. India has risen to the first position in the Baseline Profitability Index.
By 2020, the average age in India will be 29 years, and India is set to become the worlds youngest country with 64 percent of its population in the working age group.
India of today is a land of tremendous opportunities, and endless possibilities. The scale and speed of economic transformation in India is an opportunity that we do not want our friends and partner countries to miss on.
Indias growth is not in the interest of India alone. Indias rise is in the interest of the region and of the world. We want our neighbours and friends to be part of Indias growth story.
Indias recent achievements in Science and Technology have equally been unprecedented. From the heights of the stars to depth of the oceans, from space to the Moon to Mars, to now, perhaps Venus, from hydrographic surveys to oceanographic research to Antarctic expeditions, our scientists have done us proud.
Recently, Indian Space Research Organization successfully launched 104 satellites on board ISROs Polar Satellite Launch Vehicle, PSLV-C37, from Satish Dhawan Space Centre, Sriharikota. It is the highest number of satellites launched in one single mission anywhere.
India will soon have over a billion phone connections with an urban tele-density of around 154 percent. India has around 350 million internet users. Apple has decided to choose India to assemble iPhones, India being only the third country globally to have such a facility.
More people (around 25 million) travel on trains in a day in India than the entire population of many countries. India also boasts of having the second largest train network in the world. Indian Railways is also the largest civilian employer in the world. We are going to have the first bullet train run in India in 2023, including the 7-km underwater route of the Mumbai-Ahmedabad rail corridor.
We are happy to share this expertise and we have been actively involved in the reconstruction and modernization of Sri Lankan railways.
The worlds fattest woman was recently airlifted to Mumbai, for weight loss surgery to save her life. We have established our presence as the hub for health tourism. Hundreds of Sri Lankan patients, thousands from all over the world, travel to India every year for availing advanced, affordable health care facilities.
We are open to sharing our knowledge and expertise with others. Training and Technology partnerships are a key to a better tomorrow. Todays societies are built on knowledge and innovation. India currently offers around 800 scholarships annually to Sri Lankan students for various courses both in India and in Sri Lanka. In addition, India offers 375 slots annually to Sri Lankan nationals for short and medium term training courses in a wide variety of disciplines.
Time has come to focus on the specifics on what more can be done to help each other grow faster. Ideas could be many, there could be several ways, but our efforts have to be joint and focused.
Facilitate
Sri Lanka is Indias second largest trade partner in South Asia, with annual trade of more than US$ 4.6 billion. India and Sri Lanka entered into an FTA in 2000, the first for both countries. Total trade has increased 8 times since then.
We are trying to upgrade the FTA to an Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). I would like to reiterate here that we will move at a pace Sri Lanka is comfortable with.
India is also among the top investors in Sri Lanka with accumulated investments of more than billion dollars in the last 15 years. Investments worth US$ 1 billion are in the pipeline. Sri Lankan companies have also made huge investments in India in recent times such as in apparel, furniture, tea and so on. We are keen to integrate Sri Lankan companies in the supply and value chains of Indian companies.
Let me tell you that India has the largest refinery in the world in Jamnagar (Gujarat) with a capacity of refining 1.24 million barrels a day. The worlds largest solar power plant with an installed capacity of 648MW was commissioned at Kamudhi in Ramanathapuram in Tamil Nadu recently. India is keen to partner with Sri Lanka in conventional and non-conventional energy sectors. Sri Lanka has good potential in solar and LNG. We are also looking at hard infrastructure and connectivity projects.
Creating the right business environment or the so-called level-playing field is important to create the momentum for upward business spiral. Our role as facilitators to enable entrepreneurs to take the right decision is critical. As strategists, it is important that we think through the long term implications of our actions. It is important to look before we leap.
The Government of India has taken decisive steps to ease licensing processes and rationalize provisions and procedures relating to clearances, returns, and inspections. Digital technology has played a key role in this regard.
The Governments efforts to ensure Ease of Doing Business in India have been comprehensive and wide ranging including legislative and structural. The Goods and Services Tax bill has been passed and is expected to be implemented in 2017. This has been the biggest reform in indirect tax structure so far and is aimed at creating a common national market in India.
Flourish
We have also taken several steps to facilitate legitimate foreign travel into our country. We are in the process of further simplifying liberalizing and rationalizing our visa regime. We have merged the PIO and OCI Card Schemes. The benefit of Electronic-Tourist visa has also been extended to Sri Lankan nationals.
We see a future for us together where we both flourish. As I said earlier we do not see our growth as a zero-sum-game. The seas that separate us are the seas that connect us. It is a matter of perception.
Our security is closely intertwined. We are closely engaged with Sri Lanka on maritime security, maritime domain awareness, maritime Search and Rescue, anti-piracy operations and so on. It is therefore no surprise that Colombo was the destination for the maiden overseas port call of INS Vikramaditya, Indias aircraft carrier, and Indias newest and largest ship in January 2016. Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena was the first foreign head of State onboard the ship.
India has extended a defence Line of Credit to Sri Lanka for US$ 100 million to procure variety of defence equipment and supplies. Sri Lanka is also procuring two Offshore Patrol Vessels from India.
India provides large number of training slots to Sri Lankan military and security personnel. Our developmental partnership with Sri Lanka is aimed at ensuring a prosperous Sri Lanka not only in the present but also in the future. We want Sri Lanka to succeed not just now but equally in the eternal future that lie ahead. This is a friendship which we cherish, which we want to nurture and uphold for generations to come.
We measure the importance of a partnership not in terms of numbers on Excel Sheets. We measure the significance of a partnership by the interconnectedness that you and I have.
Our geography may have shaped our history. But it is our joint efforts that will shape our future. This is a task which cannot be fulfilled by Governments alone. As our Foreign Secretary says it is the street that leads the system. The role of the industry, academia, intelligentsia, common citizen on both sides in bringing this synergy cannot be understated. I am confident that Sri Lanka India Society will continue to make efforts to turn this vision into a reality.
As Lord Buddha said, Every morning, we are born again. What we do today is what matters the most. Let us focus, facilitate and flourish together, today, and everyday.
Thank You and have a wonderful evening!

French connections
What we want, is that when you hear the word French, the first thing that will come to mind is Alliance Francaise de Kandy, says the ambitious director of the Kandy branch, Mickael Lenglet. This year is the 50th anniversary of the institute and the work that they have been doing to promote the French culture it truly commendable. Daily News speaks to Michael Lenglet on the rise of Alliance Francaise De Kandy.
In Kandy, this year, there will be the traditional French Film Festival organized by Francophone Embassies in Sri Lanka and the Alliance Franaise. But there is also Lab Citoyen, a competition to win a trip to France. We decided to organize a school contest which is organized by the Alliance Franaise Kandy and St Anthonys Girls College. The Plume dOr where students of the Alliance Franaise can, once again, try to win a trip to Paris.
To celebrate this important anniversary, we came up with an ambitious idea: to organize 50 events! There will be the gala dinner on May 27 in presence of Mr. Jean-Marin SCHUH, Ambassador of France in Sri Lanka and the Maldives. And we are planning events to celebrate the music festival in June. There will be more competitions, exhibitions and festivals. Some of them are still in preparation, explained Lenglet.
Every year, on March 20 the International Day of Francophonie is celebrated. This is a huge event for many reasons. The International Organization of the Francophonie is gathering 84 countries who all value the French language, whether it is their national language, official language, teaching language or just because they cherish the values defended by the organization. It is estimated that there is now over 274 million speakers of French over the world.
Week of the Francophonie
In many countries, they organize the week of the Francophonie, and even sometimes the month of the Francophonie! And of course, all these events are organized by the French embassies in partnership with the Alliance Franaise network. We are very proud to say its been 50 years since Alliance Franaise was created in Kandy. 50 years that we promote French language and organize cultural events. Because, that is the mission of an Alliance Franaise  to create a bond between France (and Francophone cultures) and the host country. We are 90 percent self-financed, said Lenglet.
What people usually dont know is what Alliance Franaise is.
First we are a Sri Lankan Association. We work closely with the French Embassy, but we are not dependent on France. As every Association, we have members and we also have an Executive Committee composed of local people who accept to fulfill the position on a voluntary basis. Second point, we are a non-profit institution, which means that the money we are receiving through our activities are used to offer better services  better facilities and assets, better teaching quality, more cultural activities, pointed out Lenglet.
The aim is to promote French culture, as well as to provide a space for intercultural exchanges between Sri Lanka and the cultures of the French-speaking world.
A teacher at the Alliance Franaise, has pioneered pedagogical methods that take into account the mother tongue and the learning style of all of its students. Alliance teaching methods combine a classic approach to language acquisition and an open-mindedness to new modes of communication. The Alliance is adopting new technologies and has created partnerships and has diversified our course offering. The Alliances recognition by the French Education Ministry as well as by European organizations speaks volumes about the Alliances leadership in the field, elucidated Lenglet
The Alliances pedagogical mission is inextricably linked to its commitment to culture. Hence, the Alliances have forged their identities by meshing French language and French artistic creation with a wonderfully diverse student body. In short, a language truly lives when it is shared.
At the moment, French is still considered by young learners as a subject for the A-Level. But it is so much more than that. Speaking French is a formidable asset for their future: to study or work abroad or to add strong professional skills. We are currently reviewing our courses and we are very happy to say that we will be offering French classes for Tourism, where professionals will have the opportunity to learn French to communicate with French tourists because a lot of French people dont speak English, shared Lenglet.
The institute are also reviewing their O-Level and A-Level programs which should be ready for next June.
Since I arrived, I realized that there was a strong competition in French teaching in Kandy. However, I also realized that there are a lot of fake courses organized by people who can hardly speak French! They manage to do their whole class without speaking a word of French and charge the students with very high fees!. I also understood that most A-Level students are worried about failing their exam, so they are ready to pay a lot of money. I always wonder, why dont they all come to the Alliance Franaise Kandy Students who study with us pay less and they are taught by teachers who received regular trainings from professionals invited from France to help them discover new teaching technics, argued Lenglet.
The new O-Level and A-Level programs will combine language learning with intensive preparation to the skills needed for the exams which are grammar, translation and written expression.
In the Alliance Franaise Kandy, students are sorted in level groups and we make sure that Beginners are not mixed with more advanced students  this sounds so obvious and still so rare to find! And the cherry on the cake, we also are the only French institute in Kandy to have both local and native French speaking teachers, emphasized Lenglet.
Lenglet has been in Sri Lanka since June 2016. Before being in Kandy, He spent 12 years in Ireland where he taught French in the most prestigious Irish university, Trinity College Dublin, and then in the Alliance Franaise Dublin, which is the 3rd biggest Alliance in Europe and, where he was the Headmaster.
I was teaching students of all ages and all levels. I worked closely with the French Embassy and the French Teachers Association to develop programs to help teachers of French in their daily work. I am qualified as a trainer for French teachers after completing 2 Masters degrees: one in linguistics and one in Teaching French as a foreign language. My years in Ireland were wonderful but then I had the feeling I needed something different  to discover a new country, a new culture and to start new projects. That is when I was recruited by the Executive Committee of the AF Kandy as its new director, informed Lenglet.
Lenglet pointed out that they have been in Kandy for 50 years and there are still people who have no idea who they are
Therefore, my first thought was that we need people to hear about us. We started to organize more events. We create a Newsletter to promote our events, we created a brand new website (www.afkandy.lk). Basically, what we want is this, summed up Lenglet.

GMOA sends letter to President against SAITM representatives

The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) has sent a letter to President Maithripala Sirisena urging to take action against the officials of the Attorney General's Department who represented the Department for SAITM case.
GMOA Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa, addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo today (7) said that the GMOA requested the President to take action against the Attorney General and his lawyers who represented the department for SAITM case.
According to Zoysa, the conduct of the Attorney General and his lawyers who represented the department for SAITM during the Court of Appeal was not satisfactory at all and they acted enabling to offer legality for a private institution without required standards.
Zoysa pointed out that they failed to present accurate and relevant facts at the Court of Appeal during the hearing of the case.
Among the things that they have failed to do are, not informing the stand of the former Health Minister, now President, on SAITM issue, not appearing for the Sri Lanka Medical Council which is the state body established through a Parliament Act to protect patients' rights and not informing the Judiciary that SAITM has not obtained the Compliance Certificate.

Goodman reveals surprising complaint against Kong Skull Island
Unsurprisingly, though, he was only kidding when venting his light-hearted frustration.
The new film has been praised for doing away with the traditional King Kong plot of having a Beauty and the Beast style story with the female protagonist and the titular beast.
That seems to be great, progressive news for Brie Larson - but not so much for Goodman.
Speaking to the NY Daily News, director Jordan Vogt-Roberts said: Weve seen it before so many times, and weve seen it done well so many times. So why tread in that territory again What do we possibly have to gain retelling the beauty and the beast storyAnd frankly, I dont think the beauty and the beast story is as progressive or relevant in 2017.
But Goodman quipped: I was surprised that I wasnt the beauty. That hurt.
Alas, the possibility of a love story between John Goodman and King Kong will be resigned to viewers imaginations for the time being.
On a more serious note, the actor revealed that he never thought he would get the chance to a monster movie.
I never thought Id have a shot of doing anything like this, the 64-year-old confided. I dont fit any of the types that would be in a King Kong movie.
The films producer also spoke out on rumours leading man Tom Hiddleston could next take on the role of James Bond.

The British actress, who also lent her voice to Belle, said, For me, Beauty was the perfect, most joyful thing to do. There was something connected about Hermione and Belle, and it was good to be reminded that I am an actress; this is what I do. The film is pure escapism.
The actress is making a comeback after taking a year off to focus on her efforts to bring about social change through HeForShe initiative.
It wasnt about me necessarily proving anything I was just thinking that I have this year to myself, so lets see what we can do to move the needle and make a difference, Emma said.
Talking about the criticism that comes with being an activist, she said, There is a level of criticism that comes with being an actress and a public figure, which I expect, but once you take a stance on something like feminism, thats a completely different ball game.

Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha was on an official visit to India recently, to study and discuss the performance of Local Authorities in India. The official visit was on the request of the Andhra Pradesh Chief Minister Nara Chandrababu Naidu who visited Sri Lanka several months ago.
Musthapha attended events organised by the Chief Ministers office in Andhra Pradesh and held several discussions with state officers about the Local Governance in the area.
Addressing media Minister Musthapha said, I got the chance to study the structure of Local Governance in Andhra Pradesh which can be followed in order to overcome the issues pertaining in the Local Governance in Sri Lanka. It includes the manner in which powers should be implemented in a certain Local Authority and how the officers should work accordingly. Though we have long term issues in the Local Governance system in Sri Lanka, none of the officers try to overcome them.
The performance of the Indian officers is really appreciable and we Sri Lankans have lot to gain from them. They have their own procedure of delivering a regular service through their institutes. The officers are dedicated and the quality of services rendered by them are high. They pay special attention towards the welfare of the general public including matters regarding public health and controlling the stray dog population, he said.
During the discussions, the Chief Minister of Andhra Pradesh promised to offer special training programmes to Sri Lankan state officers in the Local Governance and offer required resource persons to hold these training programmes in Sri Lanka.
The Minister of Human Resource Development Siriniwas Rao, Minister of Municipal Administration & Urban Development, Urban Water Supply and Urban Planning, P. Narayana and several politicians attended the discussion.
The two parties discussed updated issues related to the waste management, public health, introducing smart city, controlling stray dog population and controlling fraud and corruption in Local Government Institutions. It is important to maintain a quality service in Local Authorities, as it is the closest Government Institute to the general public.

Alcohol makes everything easier. At least for Dakota Johnson, who admitted in a new interview that shots of whiskey helped her while filming steamy sex scenes with Jamie Dornan for Fifty Shades Darker.While chatting with Entertainment Tonight about the Fifty Shades of Grey sequel, Johnson confessed that she and Dornan adopted a pre-game ritual before getting busy.
The 27-year-old actress, who stars as Anastasia Steele, said she would take a shot of whiskey (and) mints before the cameras started rolling.
He does pushups and I just lay there and drink whiskey, she said.
Johnson told the outlet that filming the X-rated scenes wasnt exactly easy, but said she was a lot more comfortable because she and Dornan have become so close.
Dornan, who plays the BDSM-obsessed Christian Grey, agreed explaining that he and Johnson barely knew each during the first movie.
[Now] its been three years, [and] Dakota and I are very close, he told ET. Weve got a great sort of love and respect for each other. Were great friends and I think that makes it easier, you know So its definitely more comfortable.

The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) is working hand in glove with the government in trying to postpone the local government elections, parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara said yesterday.
Addressing a press briefing organised by the Socialist Alliance, Nanayakkara noted that the JVP is trying to postpone the LG elections by finding loopholes in the new proposed systems.
Both the JVP and government wants the LG polls postponed as both fear heavy losses at an impending election. They are working hand in glove to postpone the elections, he added. Nanayakkara said the joint opposition was planning an agitation campaign against the government demanding immediate measures to hold the LG poll without delay. Socialist Alliance member Raja Kollure said the government has failed to maintain law and order and underworld thugs seem to be running amok. Kollure said if steps are not taken forthwith the law and order situation could worsen, jeopardising the security and safety of the citizens.

We have decided to put in place a joint security plan to provide security to suspects who are allegedly involved in crime and underworld activities.

The redeveloped runway of the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport will facilitate the worlds largest planes such as the A-380 as its width is increased from 60 to 75 metres, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He was on an inspection tour of the ongoing development work of the airport yesterday. He said the runway is being rehabilitated after a lapse of 30 years as the Good Governance Government had given priority towards the improvement work.
If neglected, the Airport would have even been blacklisted by International Aviation Authorities.
The Minister who recalled that they even had to face brickbats when development was begun on January 6 said the government closed the airport for only 8 hours during the day without resorting to a total closure.
He said 75 percent of the development work was now complete and the Airport was expected to be in full operation by April 6 this year.
He said thereafter work would be started on the second terminal building by July and Tenders had already been called to hand over construction work to a successful bidder.

Lopez feared she would never have kids
Motherhood is a blessing for Jennifer Lopez because the superstar once worried she would never have children.
The Monster-in-Law actress/singer became a mum in 2008 when her fraternal twins Max and Emme were born, and she recently marked their ninth birthdays by calling her kids the biggest blessings of my life in an emotional Instagram post.
Jennifer, 47, adores every part about being a parent because there was a time when she feared she would have to give up her dreams of starting a family.
They (her twins) just made my life so much better so Im forever grateful, she told U.S. breakfast show Today. I didnt have kids until later; I almost thought that it wasnt going to happen for me, so Im like, very aware that I was blessed with that and it could have been something different, and so I dont take it for granted.
The beauty, who is a Roman Catholic, has previously admitted she initially struggled to conceive, but decided against pursuing in vitro fertilisation (IVF) because she wanted to leave her fate in Gods hands.
I have a lot of faith in that, so I just felt like you dont mess with things like that, she told Elle magazine in 2010. And I guess deep down I really felt like either this is not going to happen for me or it is. You know what I mean And if it is, it will. And if its not, its not going to.
Jennifer split from her twins father, Marc Anthony, in 2011 and they finalised their divorce in 2014, but the former couple has remained close and recently reunited to celebrate their childrens birthdays. They have also teamed up in the recording studio to work on Jennifers forthcoming Spanish-language album.

He presented a detailed examination of the dynamics of trade and global value chains in Asia since the global financial crisis; comparing patterns of trade during pre and post-crisis periods, with a focus on export growth during these periods. He mapped and explained the export slowdown, and considered how the dynamics may affect Sri Lanka, including new opportunities in trade.
The presentation noted that the average annual growth of exports in developing Asia has declined sharply from 11.2% in 2001-2010 to 4.7% in 2011-2015. The slowdown reflects a fragile post global financial crisis environment of weak import demand in advanced economies, moderating growth and re-balancing in China and a rise in protectionism.
Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's average annual growth rate of exports increased slightly from 1.5% in 2001-2010 to 2.7% in 2011-2015 but is at half the average growth for developing Asian countries. This is indicative of Sri Lanka's catch-up potential with developing Asia particularly economies in East Asia.
Dr.Wignaraja observed that China is entering a new phase of technology-led export growth that plugs into regional value chains in East Asia. The migration of Chinese labour-intensive global value chain (GVC) stages to other countries opens an opportunity for Sri Lankan firms to engage with labor-intensive GVCs in industries ranging from clothing to electronics.
Dr.Wignaraja analysed the potential of small and medium scale enterprises as a crucial sector in GVCs, both as direct or indirect exporters. He indicated that several measures are necessary to promote this sector in Sri Lanka; including prioritising the financing of SMEs via a number of specific methods, improving financial literacy, addressing language barriers (especially in English) to ensure that SMEs have access to GVCs, and forming SME clusters along with the required incentives and infrastructure facilities.
He highlighted the need to rapidly diversify and widen Sri Lanka's export base beyond products and services such as garments, tea, tourism and BPOs, and in particular, to increase the share of services in exports.
Dr.Wignaraja emphasised that Sri Lanka should improve labour productivity through labour market reforms, prioritise the upgrading of tertiary-level engineering skills and invest in physical and digital infrastructure.
He urged policymakers to avoid protectionist pressures and maximise the benefits of an open economy by reducing import tariffs, improving surveillance of non-tariff measures and improving the investment climate. Other desirable measures would include ratifying the WTO's Trade Facilitation Agreement to reduce trade costs, engaging with mega free trade agreements like the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) for new markets, and promoting good regulatory practices.
The discussion was moderated by LKI Executive Director, Dr. Dinusha Panditaratne.The round table discussion was attended by leading policymakers and experts, including the Deputy Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Harsha de Silva, and senior officers of the Ministries of Finance, National Policy and Economic Affairs, Industry and Commerce, Development Strategies and International Trade, as well as from the Board of Investment and Department of Commerce.
Representatives from the ADB, the Harvard Center for Development, and leading think tanks and private sector companies also participated in the round table.

Merritt among Olympic stars to win US Indoor titles
WASHINGTON Monday :
Former Olympic 110m hurdles champion Aries Merritt signaled a return to form after a 2015 kidney transplant by winning the 60m hurdles crown Sunday at the US Indoor Track and Field Championships.
Merritt captured his first US Indoors title since 2012, the year he also won the world indoor and Olympic hurdles titles, in 7.51 seconds edging Aleec Harris by .03 of a second.
I'm just happy to come out here and get the win, Merritt said. It proves I've still got it and I'm going to give it all I've got. The 31-year-old from Chicago, who holds the 110m hurdles world record of 12.80, said he was in some ways relieved after missing last year's Rio Olympics because his trail leg was in pain the entire 2016 season.
The three-day meet at high altitude in Albuquerque, New Mexico, concluded with wins by a host of US Olympic standouts plus some impressive newcomers.
Ronnie Baker, coming off World Indoor Tour wins at Torun and Birmingham, matched the sixth-best time ever clocked to win the 60 meters in 6.45 seconds.
I had the notion I could do something pretty special, Baker said. We've been practising for this ever since October.
My biggest goal right now is to make the world championship team this summer and make the Olympic team in 2020. Also taking a first US Indoor 60m crown was Rio 4x400 US gold medal relay member Morolake Akinosun, who ran 7.08 to edge Dezerea Bryant by .03 for the women's win.
I had a really great start, she said. I stayed focused on my drive and I know I can really race well so I just stayed with it. Reigning Olympic and world indoor champion Michelle Carter won her fifth consecutive US indoor crown with an effort of 19.03m. She is the daughter of former NFL player Michael Carter, a three-time Super Bowl champion with San Francisco who won shot put silver at the 1984 Olympics.
Another NFL daughter to win Sunday was 2016 world indoor high jump champion Vashti Cunningham, who cleared 1.96m to defend her US title. She is the 19-year-old daughter of retired quarterback Randall Cunningham.
My dad is so used to everything. He has been through it already, she said. He tells me everything I need to know and everything I have to do for every obstacle I come to. Rio Olympic and 2016 world indoor runner-up Sandi Morris defended her US Indoor women's pole vault crown by clearing 4.70m.
So happy to take home my second USA Indoor Title! Not happy with my mark, she tweeted. Using this indoor as learning experience.

Neverland Ranch
Michael Jacksons Neverland Ranch is back on the market with a new name and a seriously reduced price tag.
The property near Santa Barbara, California, has been renamed Sycamore Valley Ranch, and its up for sale at $67 million (55 million) - a big difference from the $100 million (81 million) it hit the market at in 2016.
The estate features a main house, pool house, dance studio/movie theatre, barn, train station and a fire house.
This is a rare and truly remarkable estate of 50 maintained acres surrounded by some four square miles of natural beauty running to the distant mountain ridges, realtor Joyce Rey says. Structures of magnificent quality and comfortable luxury make this a singular residence designed for an extraordinary California ranch and naturalist lifestyle.
Shes also encouraging wine lovers to check out the grounds as the soil and climate are well suited to provide high quality wine grapes.
Michael Jackson sold his famous home to bosses at Colony Capital prior to his death in 2009 for $22.5 million (18.3 million).
He moved out after the ranch was raided by police seeking evidence to support claims the King of Pop had abused kids at his home ahead of his 2005 child molestation trial.
Jackson was acquitted of all charges and vowed never to return to Neverland Ranch.
His daughter, Paris, recently went back to the place where she grew up and declared it felt so good to be home.
The 18-year-old toured the family hideaway in October (16) with her then-boyfriend, Michael Snoddy, and shared a series of photos documenting her trip down memory lane with fans on Instagram.
The teen also spent some time with the animals at Neverlands petting zoo.
Her dad bought Neverland in the late 1980s.

Nine dead in Japanese helicopter crash
JAPAN: All nine people aboard a helicopter that crashed during a mountain rescue drill in Japan over the weekend were killed, police said Monday.
Six bodies were found in the morning inside the wreckage in the central prefecture of Nagano, a Nagano police spokesman told AFP. Three others, including the pilot, were confirmed dead on Sunday after a police helicopter located the crash site on a snowy mountainside.
Bad weather halted rescue operations until Monday.
The government will send investigators to the area where the helicopter went down on Sunday, public broadcaster NHK reported. The nine people on board the aircraft were rescuers and local government officials involved in a mountain rescue exercise, according to NHK and other media.

No big deal!
Raees Alam runs an illegal alcohol empire in a Gujarat shrouded in prohibition; ACP Majmudar is in charge of toppling him off his high position. Will Raeess own brand of righteousness save him
Gear up for a throwback to the great Salim-Javed blockbusters of the Seventies, where the hero grows up mid-action, every second line is meant to show off the characters swagger, a Helen song (Sunny Leone here) breaks the tension and action sequences compel you to whistle.
Carrying that legacy forward, is Raees. Shah Rukh Khan plays the titular character of a spectacled goon who hates being called battery; he starts from harmless Ponzi schemes but graduates to pre-planned rackets and becomes the top bootlegger of his town.
When ACP Majmudar (Nawazuddin Siddiqui) is posted in his area, he meets his equal. Raees forms a nexus with politicians who fuel his business, but he soon becomes the thorn in their side.
Robin Hood zone
The first half is well-paced; it draws you in and makes you root for the bootlegger; Majmudars one-liners and the music whet your appetite and the Laila Main Laila sequence ups the ante. But the second half plunges into a weird Robin Hood zone where the antiheros morals are suddenly defibrillated and he becomes a messiah. The movie takes a rough path there on, and the long runtime makes the ride bumpier.
Shah Rukh Khan has never looked better; hes full of fury and for once, isnt spreading his arms, but breaking others. The film lies entirely on his shoulders and he carries the weight most of the times. When he doesnt, the ever-so-reliable Nawazuddin Siddiqui steps in with his crackling performance. In the trademark Nawaz style, he delivers some comic relief while playing the Tom to Khans Jerry. Mahirah is restricted to songs and a few emotional scenes, but doesnt really add much. If her purpose was to soften the baddie, its lost on the viewer.
Popcorn-entertainment
The movie can feel a bit long, but if youre going for a great Shah Rukh performance and some good ol popcorn-entertainment, it might just raees to the occasion.
Shah Rukh Khan breaks through in some moments but is stymied by florid, seen-too-many-times flourishes in Raees. It is Nawazuddin Siddiqui who really shines through.
Shah Rukh Khan returns in and as Raees, a golden hearted mobster who does bad things for a good cause. It is a role constructed to grab back his pole position, and to that end Shah Rukh Khan strains at fulfilling every single point of the In and As trope.
He sings and dances, he fights and romances: he also tries to fulfill the outlines of a character.

North Korea fires missiles, three reach Japanese waters
SOUTH KOREA: Nuclear-armed North Korea launched four ballistic missiles on Monday in another challenge to President Donald Trump, with three landing provocatively close to Americas ally Japan.
Seoul and Washington began annual joint military exercises last week that always infuriate Pyongyang, with the Norths military warning of merciless nuclear counter-action.
Under leader Kim Jong-Un, Pyongyang has ambitions to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the US mainland -- which Trump has vowed will not happen.
Seoul said four missiles were fired from North Pyongan province into the East Sea -- its name for the Sea of Japan -- and that South Korea and the US were closely analysing tracking data for further details.
The missiles travelled around 1,000 kilometres (620 miles) and reached an altitude of 260 kilometres, said a spokesman for South Koreas Joint Chiefs of Staff, adding they were unlikely to be ICBMs.
Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said three of the North Korean missiles came down in Tokyos Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) -- waters extending 200 nautical miles (370 kilometres) from its coast.
This clearly shows North Korea has entered a new stage of threat, Abe told parliament.
The Norths repeated launches clearly violate UN Security Council resolutions, he said. We can never tolerate this. Tokyos chief government spokesman Yoshihide Suga added that Japan was considering calling for an emergency Security Council meeting.
Pyongyang carried out two atomic tests last year and a series of missile launches, but Monday was only the second time its devices had entered Japans EEZ.
In Washington, the State Department strongly condemned the launches, saying the US was ready to use the full range of capabilities at our disposal against this growing threat.
We remain prepared -- and will continue to take steps to increase our readiness -- to defend ourselves and our allies from attack, acting spokesman Mark Toner said in a statement.
After an emergency meeting of South Koreas National Security Council, acting president Hwang Kyo-Ahn called the Norths nuclear and missile provocations immediate and real threats to his country.
Considering the North Korean leaderships brutality and recklessness shown through the murder of Kim Jong-Nam, the results of the North having a nuclear weapon in its hands will be gruesome beyond imagination, he said.
Seoul has blamed Pyongyang for the killing of the half-brother of the Norths leader by two women using VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpurs international airport last month. - AFP

Old man Norm blows up an amorous storm
We've all met men who think theyre Gods gift to womankind. And no matter how many times theyre rebuffed, they always bounce back. Yes, they certainly display the bulldog spirit as well as the canine propensity for promiscuous behaviour as well as tenacity.
Yes you have to make way for the seasoned strategists, a band of old-timers at whose expense Mother Nature has pulled a cruel joke. Everyone is aware that they are basically pathetic old lechers who never got past any of their sleazy flirtations. For all of us middle age is the awkward period when Father Time starts catching up with Mother Nature. And of course there is nowhere to run. Of course some men talk of killing time, not realising that it is time that quietly kills them.
The Yanks say they put a man on the Moon. And some women say if they put a man on the moon, they should be able to put them all up there. But again the old lechers go one step further making a giant romantic leap for mankind by being over the moon with their fantasies of debauchery.
Take old Norm for instance. He had been observed every morning in running shorts stretching his antiquated leg muscles on a fence as a bevy of young women trotted by and suddenly the purpose of his running became very clear. The yearning for lost youth! Or rather the futile attempt at the preservation and elongation of youth and the postponement of decrepitude. Good luck, old man!
Norm was an astonishingly self-deluded, portly old rake who used to visit the press club after being sympathetically placed in the editorial geriatric paddock because of his committed years of service. He was observed always collapsing into a hunch over his drink snarling at his fellow male imbibers. He was the very image of the cynical misanthrope.
But he was the epitome of charm and chivalry whenever a woman walked in. His unshakable belief in his ability to seduce anything in skirts periodically transformed him into the eternal secondary school Romeo. He was an unattractive, old, slob, of a sweating, dull man who loved to chat up and expect dates from women. He wasnt selective about his choices either. Dont get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with older men chatting up younger women or unattractive men chatting up pretty women.
We all have our qualities that cannot be predetermined at face-value. However there are extreme situations and what makes them more extreme is the audacity with which this man desperately and unrelentingly propositioned the dames.
So what is the verdict Do these men look in the mirror ever or listen to themselves speak Are they simply delusional Or maybe they have managed to convince a few highly insecure females to go out with them through constant flattery and desperate behaviour and this has in turn caused them to have higher expectations
It has also been said that there is no fool like an old fool, except of course a young fool. But the young fool has first to grow up to be an old fool to realise what a darn fool he was when he was a young fool.
As I grow older, I pay less attention to what men say. I just watch what they do. A journalist soon learns the art of human psychology by simply observing. As they say, a psychologist is a man who watches everyone else when a beautiful woman enters the room. They are well past the stage of middle age when a man is at the peak of his earning power. But these old fools are in their dotage but have still not relinquished their yearning power. And so it was with old man Norman, a Brit journalist who worked on the same newspaper in Hong Kong as I. We called him Norm for short and AbNormal for long. Yes gentle reader, it seems all too true that Mother Nature gives nuts to those with no teeth. Thats what she did to our old satyr colleague Norm, who imagined he was irresistible to all women. Every time he opened his mouth he held forth on his imagined amorous triumphs. He was the kind of dead end writer, meaning he had stopped growing at both ends and was now growing in the middle. His favourite clichs were hackneyed ones such as there is always a good tune played on an old fiddle. Or another that went: Women should be obscene and not heard and a man is only as old as the woman he feels. Anyway, we were once at the bar of the Hong Kong Press Club when an attractive young woman came up and sort of snuggled beside Norm. She burrowed in, not so much out of affection, but rather because when Norman leant against the end of the bar, there was not a lot of room left to work with. Being an old fool with low self esteem and a raging Peter Pan complex, Norm noticed her right away. They exchanged pleasantries. Norm now imagining he had a trace of the Casanova magic started a conversation. His goofy grin was priceless to witness.
The usual response he received in such situations was: "Stop staring at me you dirty, old lech!" Norm ordered a drink for her and popped the question: So what's your name" She replied: Jane! Norm quipped: You Jane! Me Tarzan!
The young woman smiled, a blazing pearly blast. "You're Norman Langford who writes all those columns in the paper, right " He admitted proudly that he was, adding: That's me. Sorry if I've offended you anytime." She shot back: "Oh no, I don't read them. Do you know you were in school with my.....
Norm cut her short: Oh, with your sister right The pretty lass shook her head doubtfully but before she could answer Norm expostulated: Okay I get it. I can see the resemblance now. Youre Elaines daughter. I used to take your mother dancing! Young Jane went into titters: Not really! But close enough! My mother is Shirley. Elaine is my maternal grandmother! I am talking about an incident that occurred about a dozen years ago. Norm even then refused to admit that he was more than 64, even if that made his children illegitimate.
Young Jane went on: Oh, I almost forgot why I came! Gran is celebrating her 67th birthday on Saturday. She would be delighted to see you there. It would be a wonderful surprise because we are inviting all her old school friends as well.
The barman ducked behind the counter and was rolling on the floor convulsed with mirth. The wicked journo loungers at the bar exploded uproariously in one accord. The place was engulfed with spilled drinks and the gurgle of liquid laughter.

President proposes stable legal order to prevent drug trafficking by sea

President Maithripala Sirisena today urged members of the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA) to adopt a comprehensive framework to prevent the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea.
The President, in his address to the IORA Leaders Summit said it was necessary to examine the dangers setting off from the sea such as piracy and terrorism.
The President observed that the trafficking of illicit drugs by sea has become an industry of sorts.
"Although various counter-trafficking measures have been implemented, there is no satisfactory end result," the Sri Lankan President said.
"It is universally recognised that all littoral states possess a maritime area bordering their coasts within which they exercise complete authority. However, beyond this limit comprise high seas and are not subject to the jurisdiction of any state. Most of the illicit drugs are smuggled into the country from the sea beyond the territorial waters," President Sirisena added.
"I suggest the IORA work out a stable legal order to confront these concerns in conformity with the principles of the freedom of navigation."
The President said it was in this context that the IORA Concord and the Action Plan was signed by member nations, strengthening the organisation's role as an active forum for dialogue.
He also said the national unity government had undertaken measures strengthen to Sri Lanka's position in the Indian Ocean region. The President revealed Sri Lanka's ambitious plans to enter the global value chain by becoming a regional hub for trade, tourism, transport and logistics.
The President stressed that it was necessary for IORA to initiate a dialogue between SAARC and ASEAN leaders.
"As our current Chair, Indonesia is also a member of the ASEAN and it may be useful to consider a initiating a dialogue linking IORA member states, its dialogue partners and all the interested major and middle powers."
The President, in his speech, welcomed Indonesia's commitment in bringing together all member nations of the IORA and its dialogue partners.
The Sri Lankan President was greeted by his Indonesian Joko Widodo upon his arrival at the Jakarta Convention Centre (JCC) to attend the IORA Leaders' Summit.

## Title: Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue: Tender Board was compelled to  comply with former Governors  decision on accepting rS. 10.5 b in bids

Presidential Commission on Treasury Bond issue: Tender Board was compelled to  comply with former Governors  decision on accepting rS. 10.5 b in bids
The Tender Board was compelled to comply with former Governor Arjun Mahendrans decision on accepting bids worth Rs.10.5 billion on the questioned Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27,2015,former Superintendent of Debt Department D.N.K. Seneviratne said.
Asked whether the decision to change from direct placement method to auction method came as a directive, former SPD Seneviratne said in fact it came as an instruction that which the PDD and the Tender Board had to accommodate.
She said even though the instruction came in verbal form, the PDD and the Tender Board, despite their disagreement, had to comply with former Governors instruction.
She also said the written instruction on changing into auction method came via the Monetary Board on March 6, 2015.
Former SPD Seneviratne also said that she was transferred to the Public Debt Department only on February 9, 2015 and that it was her first Treasury bond auction as the head of the PDD.
She went on to explain that she has been working as the Deputy Director and the Additional Superintendent of the Employment Provident Fund from 2007 and as the Superintendent of the CBSL Currency Department from 2014 until her sudden transfer.
Seneviratne mentioned that she has no experience whatsoever regarding the operations of the Public Debt Department and on the questioned auction date she was solely guided by the Assistant Superintendents of Debt, Head of the Front Office and other officers of the Public Debt Department.
Explaining the background to the questioned auction, Seneviratne said the then Deputy Governor Ananda Silva conveyed to her that the Monetary Board has held a meeting on February 23, 2015 and had requested the SPD to conduct a Treasury Bond issuance for the maturity period of 30 years.
The officers including the ASPD and the Head of the Front Office recommended to me to place the said Treasury bonds using the direct placement method,Seneviratne said.
Asked whether they held a DDMC meeting prior to the questioned auction, Seneviratne said did not,since the Head of the Tender Board Operational Departments was not present.
Seneviratne further said when the former Governor walked in to the PDD as the questioned Treasury bond auction was taking place, he specifically asked for the auction details.
The former Governor on his second visit asked for the auction details again and went through the bid sheet as well, Seneviratne further said.
Asked if the former Governor was able to then go through as to which primary dealers had bid at the auction, Seneviratne answered that it should have been the case.
The former SPD was testifying before the Presidential Commission to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds and the evidence was lead by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Priyantha Navana.
The witness was questioned on corresponding Tender Board minutes, bids received on the transactions at the questioned auction and the option sheets and other relevant documents.
The Tender Board decision making process with regards to the issuance of Treasury bonds, in the questioned time period and beyond, was also scrutinized by the Commission.
The Commission also questioned Seneviratne on the unusual behavior of patterns of Primary Dealers on the date where the questioned auction was held.
It was noted by the Commission that Perpetual Treasuries Limited has bid for themselves and through the Bank of Ceylon as well, which is an unusual practice. It was also noted that the market share of the questioned auction was 50% as well done by the Perpetual Treasuries Limited. The Commission also noted that if the first decision of the PDD to accept only 2.6
million bids at the questioned auction,Perpetual Treasuries Limiteds bids would not have become successful.
Seneviratne also said when she took the second auction sheet to the Tender Board, all the tender board members were shocked by the former Governors decision.
They said they cannot accept this decision until the former Governor made clarifications on the decision. They also asked as to why the former Governor had spoken to you and came into the PDD when an auction was taking place.
The then Assistant Governor Sepala Ratnayake mentioned this decision would cost the government much. Everybody wanted to go and meet the former Governor, but, in the end, Tender Board Chairman Samarasiri took a call on his mobile phone and inquired from Mahendran on the matter, Seneviratne explained.
Meanwhile, Attorney at Law Harsha Fernando representing the Tender Board Chairman, questioned former SPD Seneviratne as to who prepared the yield rates when the direct placement auction method is used and she answered that the officers of the Front Office, overseen by the ASPD prepared the auction sheet and that the prepared price approval sheet is signed by a
Deputy Governor.
The Commission also noted that former SPD Seneviratne was transferred as the Director of the Information Department, which did not comply with her expertise from September 2015.
The current SPD T.H.B. Saratchandra is to testify before the Commission today (07).

Reina out to stop old Premier League foe Ronaldo
MILAN Monday,:
If Napoli goalkeeper Pepe Reina reproduces the kind of form that was key to Saturday's 2-1 win over Roma against Real Madrid in midweek, a Champions League upset could be on the cards.
But the former Barcelona and Liverpool shot-stopper would be forgiven for also hoping Cristiano Ronaldo forgets his shooting boots Tuesday when Napoli bid to overturn a 3-1 first leg, last 16 defeat against the 11-time European champions.
At the Santiago Bernabeu last month, Reina and Ronaldo were meeting for the first time since the 2008-2009 season, when they both played Premier League football.
In England, they met a total of six times and, with three victories, a draw and two defeats while playing for Manchester United, Portugal's four-time Ballon d'Or winner Ronaldo comes out on top.
Ahead of Tuesday's clash at what Reina hopes will be a red-hot San Paolo, the odds, and statistics, are firmly stacked against Maurizio Sarri's hosts. If Napoli are to go through on away goals, they will have to do what no team has managed since Wolfsburg beat Madrid in the quarter-finals nearly a year and 46 games ago -- keep a clean sheet against Los Blancos.
As Napoli look to reach the quarter-finals for the first time, Madrid are poised to reach their seventh in succession. Yet even defeat last time out, Reina was defiant in their chances, saying post-match: We have to believe in the comeback, because we can beat Madrid 2-0 at home.
A goal away from home is very important. We have nothing to lose. Real were and are the favourites, but they can expect a red hot reception at the San Paolo. If Reina's performances for a slick Napoli side currently being inspired by the goalscoring exploits of Dries Mertens are anything to go by this season, he could provide the much-needed X factor.
Reina was superb in a thrilling 2-1 win over Roma on Saturday that saw him deny Diego Perotti at the death with an acrobatic, one-handed save he pushed onto the crossbar before sweeping the ball away away with his leg.
It was an inspired stop that secured the win for Napoli and reduced the gap on second-placed Roma to two points, but Roma, who are already eliminated, are not Real Madrid. Quantifying past meetings between Reina and Ronaldo is a difficult task: although United came out on top, Ronaldo has now only beaten Reina twice in seven encounters, once from the spot.
It took until his fifth match against Reina, during the 2007-008 season, for Ronaldo to beat the Spaniard, hitting United's second in the 79th minute of a comprehensive 3-0 win at Old Trafford.
The second, and last time Ronaldo beat Reina was from the penalty spot in the 23rd minute of a 4-1 league defeat late in the 2008-2009 campaign.
Although both Ronaldo and Bale sat out Real's 4-1 win at Eibar at the weekend due to injury, the Portuguese star is expected to be fully fit on Tuesday when Madrid will look to extend their impressive form in Europe.
Zinedine Zidane, who is expected to make five changes in all with Marcelo, Dani Carvajal and Toni Kroos joining Bale and Ronaldo, insisted Ronaldo's injury isn't serious. Ronaldo may not have been on target when Karim Benzema, Toni Kroos and Casemiro all beat Reina last time out. AFP

Request to revoke order  to confiscate bank accounts: Court turns downs Dhanunas request
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne yesterday turned down a request by Dhanuna Tillekaratne to revoke an order made to confiscate bank accounts belonging to him in connection with the HiCorp case.
While refusing to issue an order, the magistrate observed that such a request should have been made by the accused within a year following the order of the Magistrates Court to confiscate the properties. On June 30, 2010, the Colombo Fort Magistrate ordered to confiscate Rs. 15 million and US $1251 deposited in seven bank accounts belonging to Dhanuna Tillekaratne.
On October 15, 2015, the Colombo High Court ordered to acquit and release Dhanuna Tillekaratne from the HiCorp case, on the basis that the prosecution has failed to prove the accuseds guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Danuna Tillekaratne had been charged under the Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to cheat US$ 299,061.25 of public funds through the HiCorp Private Company Ltd by forwarding forged bid documents to the Army for certain supplies to the Defence Ministry 2007-2008 after convincing the Army to deposit the money, while appearing as an agent of the British Borneo Defence Company in Australia.

Rihanna shares collegiate dreams during Harvard University acceptance speech
Rihanna shared her dreams of attending college as she accepted her 2017 Humanitarian of the Year Award at Harvard University on Tuesday (28Feb17).
The Grammy-winning Diamonds singer was saluted for her philanthropy, and while receiving her trophy, she praised the benefits of charity.
You dont have to be rich to be a humanitarian, the stunning star said during her speech, according to PageSix. You dont have to be rich to help somebody. You dont gotta be famous (sic). You dont even have to be college-educated.
As the crowd roared with laughter, Rihanna stressed pursuing a degree in higher education is something she only hopes to accomplish in the years ahead.
I mean, I wish I was (college educated)  especially today, she insisted, Its true, I might come back (to school).
Rihanna has dedicated a lot of time to charity in recent years - she donated nearly $2 million (1.6 million) to the Clara Braithwaite Center for Oncology and Nuclear Medicine at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Barbados in 2012 in honour of her late grandmother. She also created the Clara Lionel Foundation scholarship programme, which awards students from the Caribbean who attend university in the U.S. with scholarships. In addition to this, she has been hosting her annual Diamond Ball fundraising event since 2014, raising more than $5 million (4 million).
She also supports the Global Partnership for Education and Global Citizen Project, an organisation that provides children with access to education in more than 60 developing countries.
When I was five or six years old, I remember watching TV and I would see these commercials and I was watching other children suffer in other parts of the world, she said at Harvard. I would think to myself... I wonder how many 25 cents I could save up to save all of the kids in Africa and I would say to myself, When I grow up and get rich, Im going to save kids all over the world. I just didnt know Id be in the position to do that when I was a teenager.

Royal retains BC Anghie trophy  : Ganindu Dilshan the hero against St Peters
Centre Ganindu Dilshan was the hero scoring two crucial tries to ensure Royal College beat a completely off coloured St. Peters College by 17 points (3 tries, 1 conversion) to 10 (1 try, 1 conversion, 1 penalty) to retain the B.C. Anghie trophy in their Singer A division inter-school league rugby first round match played at Bambalapitiya yesterday, The winners led 17-3 at half time.
It was an excellent performance orchestrated by Royal centre Dilshan with a fabulous display of fast open rugby throughout the entire game where he totally dominated by over running the opponents at will to go along with his booming kicks to touch.
Royal dished out a superb brand of running rugby and gave a torrid time to the Peterites with their three quarters right throughout the entire match along with a fabulous display of defence. This really made the difference for them to come up with a win against all odds.
The Peterites opened scoring in the 25th minute through a 30-metre penalty fired across by fly half Steffen Sivaraj into a 3-nil lead.
In the 33rd minute of play Royal grabbed the lead through a try scored by Dilshan off a three quarter move. Winger Zakir Naufer missed the conversion and Royal went into a 5-3 lead.
Within five minutes Dilshan scored again under the post through a fine off load made by Royal scrum half Migara Perera following a spectacular break by the nippy half back. Naufer made the conversion and Royal went into a 12-3 lead.

Just on the stroke of half time in the 40th minute Royal went further ahead to 17-3, when off a rolling maul their prop forward Himantha Hirushan dived over for a try. Naufer missed the conversion.
After the break the Peterites closed down the gap in the 67 minute when off a three quarter move their fly half Stefen Sivaraj scored a breathtaking try under the post going through the entire Royal three quarter line. He himself made the conversion to make the score 17 points to 10.
St. Peters did attack in the final 10 minutes but their butter fingered ball handling errors cost them the match as there were no further scoring done till the referees final whistle.
