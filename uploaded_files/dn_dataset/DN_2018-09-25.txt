Retirement is a mistake
The Old Man and the Gun will begin screening at Majestic Cineplex, Colombo, Empire Arcade and many other film halls islandwide from September 28
Last month, screen legend Robert Redford said he was finished with acting, and planned to focus on directing in his golden years. But in an interview published recently, Redford says he may have spoken too soon.
That was a mistake. I should never have said that, the 82-year-old actor told the entertainment publication Variety late Thursday at the New York premiere of his latest film, The Old Man and the Gun.
If Im going to retire, I should just slip quietly away from acting, but I shouldnt be talking about it because I think it draws too much attention in the wrong way. I want to be focused on this film and the cast, he said.
The comments backtracked from what he told Entertainment Weekly in early August: Never say never, but I pretty well concluded that this would be it for me in terms of acting.
So, what does the future hold Is Old Man his last movie or not
Im not answering that, he told Variety. Keep the mystery alive.
In the August interview, Redford said that he would move toward retirement after Old Man because hes been in the acting business for more than 60 years.
I thought, well, thats enough. And why not go out with something thats very upbeat and positive he told Entertainment Weekly.
Director David Lowery told Esquire magazine that Redford had mentioned during the filming of The Old Man and the Gun that it would be his last film as an actor.
The film, set for release in the United States on September 28, sees Redford play Forrest Tucker, the real-life bank robber whose criminal career and multiple escapes from prison spanned more than 60 years. Redford is an Oscar winner, but not for acting: he won in 1981 for best director for Ordinary People.

Right to live in peace
Each year the International Day of Peace is observed around the world on September 21. The General Assembly has declared this as a day devoted to strengthening the ideals of peace, both within and among all nations and peoples.
While the Second World War was raging on, various attempts were made for the establishment of an international peace organisation. The London Declaration (June 1941), The Atlantic Charter (August 1941), Moscow Declaration (October 1943), Teheran Conference (December 1943), Yalta Conference (February 1945), and finally, the San Francisco Conference.
San Francisco Conference on June 25, 1945, managed to form the United Nations Organisation and 51 nations got together and began to discuss on the UNO Charter. And, four months later, the UNO came into official existence.
By that time, two world wars had claimed nearly 100 million lives across the globe. All countries who came together to create the UNO system promised that the organisation was formed to save succeeding generations from the scourge of war. By adopting these words as the lynchpin of the U.N. Charter, the member states imagined that long-term peace was possible.
But it was not so. Modern history shows us that their dreams didnt come through. The adoption of the Charter and the U.N. system did not put an end to wars. Indeed, the resort to military force has become the default method of resolving international disputes.
Charter
Now, 73 years later, it is not too late to rekindle what the original drafters of the Charter dreamed. That requires instilling in the public imagination that national and international peace is possible. And every citizen, in which country he or she lives, has a basic human right to live in peace.
Internationally, peace requires that all countries refrain from interfering in the internal affairs of other countries, settle their disputes through continued negotiations, and create conditions necessary to eliminate the causes of conflict.
Nationally, peace requires moving beyond the rhetoric and to make concerted efforts toward achieving enduring peace among their various communities. The citizens and their representatives are expected to explore all the avenues that build, sustain and consolidate peaceful co-existence.
However, both internationally and nationally, right to peace has not been a reality. In the case international wars and disputes, one major reason was that UNO - the only international forum for peacekeeping has failed to live by its stated principles. It continued to serve largely as an instrument of U.S. foreign policy.
In the case of national disputes like civil wars, the major reason in most countries was the politicisation of ethnic and religious harmony. As a result, the leaders havent understood that societal conflicts are existential threats to a countrys national survival leading to horrific consequences of the loss of peace.
Discrimination
One year ago, in September 2017, UN Resident Coordinator in Colombo, Una McCauley said, In Sri Lanka, the war is over. Yet many still face discrimination and hate. We still have the opportunity to work together for lasting peace. So much needs to be done to ensure that everyone can participate equally in shaping the way forward for the country. It also means that we must respect each others religion, race, culture, values and political beliefs. We need to accept and work with each others differences if we are to make any meaningful progress. As long as discrimination, intolerance and inequality are encouraged or ignored, then our efforts are in vain.
She is right. In any country, the minorities, whether religious or linguistic, expect protection and understanding of the majority. The majority has an ethical responsibility to bring hope to them.
Genuine peace
Likewise, if the Government is keen to bring genuine ethnic peace to Sri Lanka, it must identify the roots of our racial problems and strive, with imagination and determination, to check conflicts in their early stages. Better still, prevent them. It must act in a timely, decisive and courageous manner, knowing that prevention engages the attention only when it fails. Peace and normality do not make the news. But a simple ethnic conflict will make headline news.
Peace, development and democracy form an interactive triangle. They are mutually reinforcing. Without democracy, there is no sustainable development or vice versa. However, without peace, there wouldnt be democracy or development. We have experienced the theory ourselves during the civil war period.
It is not the peace of silence, of men and women who by choice or constraint remain silent. It is the peace of freedom  and therefore of just laws  of equality and solidarity, in which all citizens live together and share. That is the real peace.
Key goals
Winning genuine peace in a deeply divided society like Sri Lanka is daunting. It is because any peace-seeking effort has to deal with the forces attached to the conflict. To be successful, both parties should have willingness for accommodation and compromise.
Maybe, Tamil Tigers were militarily demolished but the aspirations they shared with the people still have a greater political influence. The political goal of Tamil nationalism may tilt between political autonomy within a united Sri Lanka to federal solution based on the inalienable right to self-determination of the Tamil people.
On the other hand, the key goal of the Sinhala nationalism is to consolidate unitary state structure. In between the Tamils and the Sinhalese are the Muslims who form their identity based on their faith. Muslim political elites would seek political accommodation that would not radically challenge the aspirations of the Sinhalese.
There is a belief among our political analysts that a good democratic system will liberate masses from the burden of ethnic and religious discrimination. But Sri Lankan experiences suggest that even in a democracy, due to highly complex electoral system and the politicians desire to win power at any cost, had helped increase religious and ethnic tensions and hostility among different groups.
Also, Sri Lankas experience suggests that the opening-up of political freedom has created destructive religious and ethnic forces that are able to manipulate sensitive emotions for political gain. This has paved the way for social instability in a number of instances.
Sri Lankas 26-year civil war was not about ethnic, linguistic, and religious differences. The ethnic and religious antagonisms fuelled it, the political miscalculations precipitated it, and the mistrust created between the two communities by the politicians led it to a serious conflict which permeated in to ruthless war.
Sustainable peace
If the rubble of war is to be converted into a sustainable peace, a new constitution is needed that incorporates guarantees of equality, justice, dignity, and pluralism for all. We cannot avoid addressing the core aspirations of Tamil people. We need to think new forms of representation, if necessary, by modifying the composition of parliament.
Neelan Tiruchelvam, who was a leading Sri Lankan constitutional thinker and member of parliament said that one of the major problems with Sri Lanka since 1948, is the definition of the state. Sinhala majoritarian have always assumed a unitary entity. But something other than a unitary state matches the truly plural nature of the contemporary nation.
Jayadeva Uyangoda says, What is needed, is a futuristic political vision of an ethnically heterogenous political association called the state. That vision needs to be shared by Sinhala, Tamils, and Muslims, but, he cautions, sharing political power is the most resisted approach in Sri Lankan politics.
TNA leader R. Sampanthan puts it across more clearly: He says, Our expectation for a solution to the ethnic problem is based on a political structure outside that of a unitary government, in a united Sri Lanka in which Tamil people have all the powers of government needed to live with self-respect and self-sufficiency. We believe that only within such a structure of government can the Tamil people truly enjoy the right to internal self-determination that is their inalienable right. We are prepared to offer our cooperation and service to those committed to the achievement of such a solution.
Eventually a compromise has to come. But it would not be soft. Any solution acceptable to Tamil nationalists will almost certainly be unacceptable to Sinhala nationalists and vice versa. However, if Sri Lanka aspires to have a peaceful co-existence for a long-term economic and social development, both Sinhala and Tamil leaders must sit together and work out a solution. Compromise is the keyword for best solution and the resulting sustainable peace.

Rowling confirms Hermiones name theory
Author JK Rowling has finally confirmed a Harry Potter fan theory about Hermione Granger.
Most people who have read the books spent the first three manuscripts struggling to pronounce her unusual name right.
Back then, the films had not releases and no one knew how to pronounce her name, apart from those who had access to Stephen Frys audio books.
However, all that changed in the Goblet of Fire, aka the fourth instalment, when Hermione encountered the handsome but dim Viktor Krum.
In one particularly awkward scene, Hermione has to teach Krum how to say her name properly - spelling it out slowly as Her-my-oh-nee.
She was correcting Krum because he kept saying Hermy-own.
Harry Potter fans have speculated that the scene was inserted deliberately by the author, because so many readers were also saying Hermy-own.
Recently, lawyer Atulaa tweeted: Theory: @jk_rowling included that passage on how to pronounce Hermiones name in Goblet of Fire just to school all of us who were saying HER-MY-OWN like Viktor Krum.
JK Rowling confirmed the rumour, replying: Theory correct, and fans were delighted - with J.Ks tweet racking up more than 16,000 likes and re-tweets.
Dozens of fans have also fessed up to saying Her-me-own or even Her-moyn, as well as joking: the biggest plot twist of my childhood was learning that it wasnt pronounced that way.

He said that his regime succeeded in preventing the depreciation of rupee against the dollar in the midst of various crisis in the country.
We did not allow rupee to float and we intervened to keep it stable, Rajapaksa. He added that there are reports that a sniper gun belonging to the Police Department has gone missing. It is a serious issue that the government should look into immediately, he said.
The former President was addressing the media at Carlton following a religious event to mark the Full Moon Pya Day, yesterday Against whom are these weapons used is a question that arises, Rajapaksa said.

Skincare tips for women over 30
Aging calls for a new skincare regime, as the needs of our skin changes and evolves as we grow.
Skincare regimes adopted in our teens no longer remain relevant in our 20s.
Similarly, the products we use and the time we spend on taking care of our skin in our 20s changes in our 30s. Failing to recognise the subtle changes in our skins needs could leave us baffled when skin problems start emerging despite our best care.
When it comes to your skin, knowledge can truly be powerful.
Skin expert and co-founder of Epique (manufacturer of skincare products), Divya Mehta, suggested a list of things every woman in her 30s needs to know about her skin.
The miracle of sunscreen: In the 20s, we use a sunblock primarily to avoid sunburn and tanning. But sun damage can also cause fine lines, dark spots and wrinkles to appear prematurely on the skin. That is why, in the 30s, sunscreen should become an important component of the skincare regime. Using sunscreen with SPF appropriate for mature skin every day before going out in the sun can be of great help.
Managing acne and fine lines together: 30s are the time for pimples and fine lines to attack skin at the same time. Trusting acne cream with benzoyl peroxide to treat acne problem is not the best option. Switch to lotions and creams which have alpha hydroxy acids and beta hydroxyl acids as their active ingredients. These ingredients dont kill acne-causing bacteria but exfoliate skin, thereby treating acne and fine lines at the same time.
Exfoliation is your saviour: Ones skin can look flaky, dull and dry if not taken care of in the 30s. And the best way to avoid that look is by exfoliating religiously. A skin care regime of exfoliation twice or thrice a week is good for most skin types. You can continue to use exfoliating creams which are fruit based or organic.
Avoiding the crows feet: The skin around eyes is extra delicate and dries up faster than normal. This is the reason that fine lines, wrinkles and crows feet appear near eyes faster than the rest of the face. However, using an under eye cream or gel regularly can help to avoid fine lines and dark circles effectively.
In addition to this, the golden rule for skin care remains is that one should hydrate their skin as often as possible, and managing healthy, glowing skin in your 30s will be no problem at all!

SPECA Economic  Forum concludes
Marking the 20th anniversary of the United Nations Special Programme for the Economies of Central Asia (SPECA), high-level participants from the seven landlocked participating countries - Azerbaijan, Afghanistan, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan, recognized the benefits of regional integration and cooperation to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) in the region.
The 2018 SPECA Economic Forum was held in Almaty from 20 to 21 September, followed by the 13th session of the SPECA Governing Council. Jointly organized by the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan - current Chair country of SPECA, the UN Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific (ESCAP), and the UN Economic Commission for Europe (ECE), the Forum considered how developments in transport, trade, water, energy, the environment, statistics, ICT and innovation, and gender could transform geographical constraints into advantages, while other integration initiatives could facilitate the economic development of SPECA countries.
The Governing Council and the Forum agreed on a set of practical recommendations for structural reform to address the challenges of sustainable development in the subregion. These recommendations clearly outlined steps for strengthening SPECA as a unique platform to harness regional cooperation for the implementation of the 2030 Agenda.
As a UN platform, SPECA can be a forum for the countries and development partners to join forces and work towards progress on sustainable development for the region, said Monika Linn, Principal Adviser and Chief of Sustainable Development and Gender Unit at UNECE.
Hirohito Toda, Head of the ESCAP Subregional Office for North and Central Asia highlighted that high-transaction costs impede the integration of landlocked developing countries into the global economy. Integration provides impetus for further economic diversification. Such economic transformation, however needs to consider its impact on gender, as well as the statistics needed to measure the resulting economic, social and environmental change, so that growth is inclusive, broad-based and equitable.
Zavqi Zavqizoda, First Deputy Minister of Economic Development and Trade of Tajikistan and Chairperson of the SPECA Working Group on Trade added, Significant progress had been made towards the achievement of SDG target 17.10 on the promotion of a multilateral rules-based trading system under the WTO in the SPECA setting through the regional Trade Policy Forum in Ashgabat, meetings on Aid-for-Trade, and two readiness assessments of Kazakhstan and Azerbaijan.
SPECA was established through the Tashkent Declaration of 26 March 1998 to promote regional economic cooperation in Central Asia and the integration of these countries with the economies of Europe and Asia.

Theres action in diction amid mazes of phrases!
Anything put on usually puts me off. Thats why I lose my quiet poise and dignity when some vulgar, venomous yakko accuses me of putting on airs. And nothing is more off-putting than when one of these misbegotten, mispronouncing, maligning morons denounces me for putting on a spiffy British accent.
Mercifully for them they dont anymore. Thats because they are aware that I have my own unorthodox - and you might say unlawful - method of dealing with unfair criticism. After all, theres nothing that cannot be pre-empted or resolved with a closed-fisted smacker on the offenders kisser!
Sub-continental English sometimes sounds bizarre to Western ears.
For instance these common expressions such as dont eat my head, talking one-for-one, passing out ceremony and attainment party. Logically broken down eating ones head means something which is a persistent bother, talking one-for-one is backchat or brazen retort, passing out ceremony alludes to a graduation ceremony and an attainment party is a celebration in honour of a girl attaining puberty.
There was a friend who became the bane of our circle. He returned from a one month holiday in the States and had suddenly acquired an annoying garbled accent.
It was totally fake of course, and utterly unintelligible. No one understood a word he said. He was soon cured of his bogus affliction when his entire caboodle of friends pointed a derisive finger at him and howled like a pack of laughing hyenas.
On the other hand, many cultured Sri Lankans are decidedly cosmopolitan. They are articulate and speak flawless English. Their enunciation is crispy clear and slightly rhythmic. Indeed even Britains heir to the throne was thrown into the air by the excellent command of His Mothers language expressed by a handful of Sri Lankan dignitaries. Many of our older pukkah sahibs and former radio announcers become famous for their unmistakable sound of the Queens English and the accents of BBC and British newsreel announcers.
And despite being perceived as a little posh, received pronunciation or RP is still our favourite accent. The accent was also widely heard on the BBC in the first half of the 20th century as Lord Reith, the then director general of the BBC, promoted the accent in order to achieve a standard and proper accent among presenters  an attitude that is openly rejected nowadays at the BBC, where regional accents are in demand.
.Many will remember that on a visit to attend the 50th anniversary of Sri Lankas independence the Prince of Wales said: Some of them speak better English, than I do. In case you have to be reminded the statement was made by Britains most blue-blooded male better known to the younger generation as the man who married Diana Spencer. Charlies mum, who his grandmother called Lilibeth, is renowned for kicking off every speech in her cut-glass accent with her characteristic phrase: My husband and I.
But unquestionably theres something alluring about every accent. And them accents, sorry, I meant those accents and different terminology certainly do carry far more significant weight than actions when communicating.
For instance, our local form of English dialect is a dead giveaway of our ancestry when you always say, on the light and off the switch instead of turn the light on and switch it off. And of course, everyone knows you are Sri Lankan, but not quite socially pukkah, when you talk about folling in lauw with a lauwly lady!
Both Irish and Indian accents have definitive yet different lilts.
The Indian tone, as you know yaar, has a sort of clipped tripping pace. But the Irish intonation has a light, fluid articulation that is charming if not exotic. It has the power to charm foreigners with its swinging lightsome air.
If you are an Indian theres a good chance you dont pronounce the letter W in the English language correctly. This is because in Indian languages, the sound W doesnt exist, and so you probably dont hear it in their English either. For example an Indian would say: Vaat a vondedrrful lowvely vorld ve are a living in. Whereas an Irishman would enunciate the same sentence as: Wharrt a worn-derr-ful lurverly warrld ya arre living in!
Some of my Indian colleagues thought it hilarious when an American trying to impress saluted them in the palms clasped traditional eastern fashion and said:  Name-as-tea What he was actually trying to elicit was namaste. Everyone loves to put on an American Yankee-Doodle twang, a plummy British Limey accent or an Yindian drawl after a drink or two, right
Okay the more talented among us can do a bit of clipped cockney, Irish gibberish, guttural Scottish brogue, Afrikaans argot and Aus-tri-lian Strine! Come to think of it the Malaysian and Singaporean habit of ending every sentence with the endearing la is considered quite attractive to outsiders.
But coming back to putting the accent on accents I have received several accolades for some of my imitations of both national and international celebrities, both dead and alive. My uncanny mimicry, sometimes subtly exaggerated, for the sake of comedy usually inspires gales of laughter from appreciative audiences. The funny thing about accents and voice inflexions among various nationalities is they think we have an accent.
But in our estimation it is they who they have an accent. No Which means yes in Sri Lankan jargon! All right, I am from Sri Lanka, but my accent can drift towards both sides of the Atlantic, over the waves and across the South China Sea all the way to the Injun Ocean.
The accentuation you are wondering about is the Transatlantic accent, which I call the Cosmolantic accent. This is not a regional accent.
Rather, it is an accent that was perfected by actors and announcers. It is first, foremost and almost exclusively voice with the ability to precisely control tone, pace, pitch, timbre, tempo, modulation, resonance and accent for conciseness and clarity. But still I tend to bounce between accents over the course of a day, just for fun.
It confuses the heck out of people who dont know me. Because I love the action in diction amid all those mazes of phrases.
But the most flattering tribute came from a classic, jolly Englishman after a delightful discussion in a British pub.
I was immediately warmed by his jovial smile and cordial manner as he rose to bid me goodbye saying: By jove sir, I knew you werent English, because you speak it far too well!

Tiger Woods seals first win in five years
ATLANTA Monday: Tiger Woods scored his first victory in more than five years on Sunday, completing a two-shot win at the Tour Championship to crown a fairy tale comeback after a near two-year absence.
The 42-year-old, 14-time major winner carded a one-over-par 71 at Atlantas East Lake Golf Course to claim the 80th PGA Tour title of his glittering career.
Woods, who finished with an 11-under-par aggregate 269, raised his arms in delight after the victory, with several thousand fans ringing the green roaring their appreciation.
Woods admitted he had nearly been overcome with emotion as he walked up the 18th fairway. I was having a hard time not crying coming up the last hole, Woods said, whose most recent win before Sunday had come 1,876 days ago at the 2013 WGC-Bridgestone Invitational. I kept saying Hey, I could still play this out of bounds. But once I got the ball on the green I gave (caddie) Joey (LaCava) a high five because I knew it was done. It was an emotional finale to a year which saw Woods return to the highest level after he had once feared he may never play golf again. AFP

United States and China  impose new tit-for-tat tariffs
The United States and China have imposed new tit-for-tat tariffs against each others goods, the latest escalation in a heated trade war between the worlds two largest economies.
US tariffs on $200bn worth of Chinese goods and retaliatory tariffs by Beijing on $60bn worth of US products took effect at 0400 GMT. The two countries already exchanged tariffs on $50bn worth of each others goods earlier this year.
Soon after the tariffs went into effect, China issued a 36,000-word white paper accusing the US of economic hegemony that threatens the global multilateral trading system as well as Sino-US ties, according to Xinhua.
[The US] has brazenly preached unilateralism, protectionism and economic hegemony, making false accusations against many countries and regions, particularly China, intimidating other countries through economic measures such as imposing tariffs, and attempting to impose its own interests on China through extreme pressure, the white paper said.
Though a senior White House official last week said the United States would continue to engage China for a positive way forward, neither side has signalled a willingness to compromise.
The US official said on Friday there was no date set for the next round of talks. The Wall Street Journal reported China has cancelled upcoming trade discussions with the United States and will not send vice-premier Liu He to Washington this week.
Economists have warned that a protracted dispute will eventually stunt growth not just in the US and China but across the broader global economy. Worries about the confrontation have already rattled financial markets.
Chinese products hit with new duties include a range of consumer goods from vacuum cleaners and seafood to internet-connected devices. Previous tariffs targeted industrial goods and components. US goods targeted by Beijing include liquefied natural gas and certain types of aircraft.
The trade tensions have cast a pall over broader relations between Beijing and Washington, with the two sides butting heads on a growing number of issues.
On Saturday, China summoned the US ambassador in Beijing and postponed joint military talks in protest against a US decision to sanction a Chinese military agency and its director for buying Russian fighter jets and a surface-to-air missile system. China also recalled its naval chief from the US.
US lawmakers have called on their government to sanction Chinese officials involved in a counter-terrorism campaign in the western Chinese territory of Xinjiang, which rights activists say has led to widespread human rights abuses of Muslim minorities.
Rob Carnell, chief Asia economist at ING, said in a note to clients that in the absence of any incentives Beijing would likely hold off on any further negotiations for now. It would look weak both to the US and at home, he said, adding that there is sufficient stimulus in the pipeline to limit the damage of the latest tariffs on Chinas growth. BBC

UNP will easily defeat Rajapaksas - Navin
Defeating the Rajapaksas is an easy game for the United National Party since they do not have a Presidential Candidate so far, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said on Sunday.
He pointed out that Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot contest for a third time. He added that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and Basil Rajapaksa too have a chequered past.
Dissanayake made these observations during a meeting at Mawanella at which Highways and Road Development Minister Kabir Hashim and UNP members in the area were present.
He added that they hope to set up a UNP government of their own in the future. To do so, the party members and politicians and supporters at grass roots leavel should work with an understanding and determination.
He added that there is good understanding among the UNP youth and we have to work to a proper plan. Our party wants to remain in power until 2025.
He added that it was not difficult to defeat the Rajapaksas. What Mahinda Rajapaksa said in India was that Namal Rajapaksa has not reached the age limit to contest and therefore one of the Rajapaksa brothers would have to contest. It means that they (Joint Opposition) have no leaders other than the Rajapaksas.
Minister Dissanayake added that this was not the case with the UNP as it has a number of young leaders. He added the best one would come forward.
But, we should all stand unitedly. The UNP divided due to the R. Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and Lalith Athulathmudali conflict, Minister Dissanayake said.
He further said that thousands of jobs would be generated along with the Gamperaliya programmes.

On Messenger, the user can then interact with the character from the advertisement who shares her story and offers a way to donate meals to hungry children through the UN agency's ShareTheMeal app.In the short clip, a woman appears at a packed news conference said to be about a breakthrough medical advance.
When she speaks, she instead reveals that she has died of hunger at age eight -- followed by the UN agency's message on how to help.
Unveiling the advertisement on the eve of the annual UN General Assembly, the World Food Programme said it wanted to find a new way to drum up support for tackling hunger, which has been rising in the world through factors that include conflict and drought.- AFP

## Date: Tuesday, September 25, 2018 - 01:00
Why do dogs wag their tails
We love our doggos and despite not being able to communicate with them, we have a few ways of knowing what they want.
When they wag their tails, for example, we usually assume its because they are happy or if you see one doing it in the park, you assume that theyre friendly, approachable pets.
Some believe that our canine companions do it to convey their emotional state although there isnt any definitive answer for why they move their tails around.
Dr Stanley Coren, a professor at the University of British Columbia says a dogs tail movement serves the same function as a human smile.
The tails position, specifically the height at which it is held, can be considered a sort of emotional meter, he said in Psychology Today.
A middle height suggests the dog is relaxed. If the tail is held horizontally, the dog is attentive and alert. As the tail position moves farther up, it is a sign the dog is becoming more threatening, with a vertical tail being a clearly dominant signal: Im boss around here, or a warning, Back off or suffer the consequences.As the tail position drops lower, it is a sign that the dog is becoming more submissive, is worried, or feels poorly. The extreme expression is the tail tucked under the body, which is a sign of fear: Please dont hurt me.
So can dogs control their tails wagging
Dog tail language is complex; just like humans, they also have dialects and speed determines different feelings.
The speed of the wag indicates how excited the dog is. Meanwhile, the breadth of each tail sweep reveals whether the dogs emotional state is positive or negative.
It also appears that they often start wagging out of instinct, not out of conscious thought. Its kind of like a human frowning and is an instinctive thing rather than a conscious decision.
If you were really keen, you could keep a dog-tail-wagging dictionary to learn more about your canine friend.

Zverev seals Laver Cup  win for Europe
CHICAGO: Europe retained their Laver Cup tennis crown here Sunday as Alexander Zverev defeated Kevin Anderson to complete a 13-8 win over the World team.
Germanys Zverev came from a set down to complete a 6-7 (3/7), 7-5, 10-7 over Anderson as the Europeans successfully defended the title won in Prague last year.
Zverevs win was the final act of an enthralling day of action at Chicagos United Center, where the World team had roared back into contention in the days first rubber.
American duo John Isner and partner Jack Sock fought off two match points to defeat Zverev and world number two Roger Federer in a gripping doubles battle.
Isner and Sock prevailed 4-6, 7-6 (7/2), 11/9 to give the World team an 8-7 lead with the three singles rubbers remaining. Europe responded superbly after that early setback however, with the 37-year-old Federer returning to secure a vital three points against Isner in the first singles match of the day.
The Swiss ace came from a set down to defeat the big-serving Isner 6-7 (5/7), 7-6 (8/6), 10/7.
The win was testimony to Federers remarkable physical conditioning.
The 20-time Grand Slam singles champion outlasted Isner less than an hour after he had been beaten in the days opening doubles game.
Federer celebrated the win by performing push-ups on court with his teammates to the delight of the crowd.
The next Laver Cup, which is named after Australian legend Rod Laver, will be staged in Geneva in September 2019.

Under the Enterprise Sri Lanka Programme operated by the Ministry of Finance and Mass Media, loans have been granted to 22,957 entrepreneurs within three months.
The total amount distributed to the recipients under several loan schemes of the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme is over Rs.50,000 million, the Finance Ministry said. The Government introduced the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme in the 2018 budget to help rebuild the island as an entrepreneurial paradise using the entrepreneurial skills of Sri Lankans.
The programme was inaugurated by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on June 22, 2018.
The programme consists of 16 schemes and the special feature is that the government on behalf of the loan recipient pays either the total interest or part of the interest to the relevant Bank.
The Enterprise Sri Lanka scheme offers attractive concessionary financing to stimulate investment and expansion by entrepreneurs, SMEs and even large business. The loan amount ranges from Rs.50,000 to Rs.750 million.
The loans are issued to the recipients through several selected state and private banks.
Several popular schemes such as, Jaya Isura, Sonduru Piyasa, Madya Aruna, Arambuma, Haritha Naya, to are a part of this programme.

All set to rock n roll
Breaking out of the shackles, and doing it the way they love, is what the band Dispute is all about. Melodies speaks to Chamil Ekanayake of Dispute about their Death n Roll music.
Their music addresses some of the questions that people in power are uncomfortable about. They raise issues that directly deal with the unfairness in society.
Wikipedia defines Death n roll as the subgenre of death metal music that incorporates hard rock-inspired elements to the overall sound with elements reminiscent of 1970s hard rock and heavy metal.
Our music is Rock nRoll, and we do it for the love for it. Specifically the way it make us want to get out of the oppression that we experience every day in Sri Lanka. This oppression is in the society and in the capitalist way of living. This consumerist world is destroying our livelihood and the earth itself. It is the unfairness in Sri Lanka we want to highlight. How the rulers and certain elites are destroying the country and its people with their extreme ways of keeping us in control, said Ekanayake
Our music has a Metal Punk and Crust kind of a sound. We would like to call it Death n Roll. We love rock and roll and metal. We started this because the three of us liked this crust scene and we were the only ones into it. So we just wanted to play some awesome rock n roll and crust. But lyrically we talk about social issues a lot. Because the whole country is going in to chaos and destruction. And what better way to talk about it, than by playing some heavy music! explained Ekanayake.
The band are very much focused on putting out some thrash and some heavy metal covers. Maybe some punk as well.
We released a demo few years back. But we have remade some of those songs. And that demo gave us a lot of success. More than what we expected. That made us make new songs. And one of them is called Beera Beela. Its a pure metal punk song in Sinhala and its about drinking beer, added Ekanayake.
Their message is very simple. It is about enjoying the journey in life and basically do what you love and you will never be too old to rock n roll!
We started Dispute a few years back and the only obstacle was life and work itself such as finding the time and the money to do this. We would like to thank everyone and also all of you who piss us off! joked Ekanayake
Dispute just want to keep on making music and maybe do some tours. Record and tour basically. Like all rock bands it is the power of their music that really propels them to go forward and keep on doing with what they do. It is all about drive and force.
Lemmy Kilmister is one of the bands inspirations. According to reliable sources Lemmy was well known for his hard-living lifestyle, chain smoking, and regular consumption of alcohol. Lemmy came up through life the hard way, but Lemmy was tough and had talent, and had what it took to succeed. He played from 19752015 with the band Motorhead. It is common knowledge that the band's success peaked in 1980 and 1981 with several UK chart hits. Motorhead became one of the most influential bands in the heavy metal genre. Lemmys body and spirit took a beating because of the lifestyle he led. In December 2000, he was hospitalized in Italy with flu, exhaustion and a lung infection.
He was hospitalized with extreme dehydration and exhaustion in Germany in July 2005. On 28 December 2015, four days after his 70th birthday, Lemmy died at his apartment in Los Angeles from prostate cancer, cardiac arrhythmia and congestive heart failure.
One line in a song that describes their journey so far is - Born to lose, kill mister, live to win kill mister and our favorite artiste is Lemmy Kilmister of Motorhead who died in 2015. Lemmy is the greatest rock and roll and metal icon that ever lived. If you take the songs made by us, one of our songs that mean the most to us is Beera Beela. Coz beer is awesome and best thing that you can drink in this hot weather, pointed out Ekanayake
The best part of their music is being a part of the whole Asian music underground scene. Some of them have played in Thailand and in India to amazing crowds.

M. H. M. Ashraff:
Awakened the East
Ashraff did a yeoman service to elevatethe Colombo Port as one of the best in Asia.He rapidly started reformsin the harbour once he took chargeof the ministry. The minister establisheda marine training institutionat Oluvil and planned to constructa harbour. His gift of a lighthouseat Oluvil majestically stands to givea ray of hope to the unemployedyouth of the region.No Muslim leader will be cherishedand remembered as Ashraff dueto his achievements atthe South Eastern University
It is almost 18 years since the late Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader M. H. M. Ashraff left us never to return.
Leaders are born everywhere in the world and the services rendered by them for the good of their community are many. Although such services are remembered by the people now and then, all their names would not forever become historical as that of the late SLMC Founder Leader Minister Ashraff, whose 18th commemoration was held on September 16.
Ashraffs qualities of leadership and respect for bureaucracy developed loyalty and team spirit. He was a kindhearted, sensitive and highly emotional personality, always with a ready smile and kind word, never failing to greet his staff, colleagues and his people at least with a smile.
At the same time, he was a leader who wanted things to be done correctly and was a stickler for accurate details. Ashraff was a deeply religious man and would commence nothing without remembering the Almighty and seeking his guidance and blessings.
He played a constructive role to install former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathunga. Ashraff became a minister. The late SLMC Leader will be long remembered by every citizen as he strengthened the hands of the former President in her efforts to find a meaningful solution to the ethnic conflict.
Ashraff saw as nobody did before him, the political potential of the Eastern province with its predominantly Muslim population. Before his advent, Muslim politicians aligned themselves with the two major political parties - the UNP and the SLFP. He was no doubt permitted by the waves of radicalism then sweeping across the Islamic world and the growing power of the Arab States.
Late M. H. M. Ashraff, LLM P.C, Cabinet Minister of Ports, Shipping, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction, Member of Parliament and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress and National Unity Alliance Founder Leader, died on September 2000 while on his way to Ampara in an Air Force helicopter which crashed in a blaze of flames in Aranayake. It is almost 18 years since he left us never to return.
Ashraff was a man with a golden heart. A great and worthy son of the Eastern province, he was born in Sammanthurai. He was indeed not born with the proverbial silver spoon but at the time of his untimely death, he had established himself as a silver lining in the political establishment of this country.
He was the only son of Mohamed Hussain, a highly respected village headman, and Matheena Ummah whom he loved dearly. Being a son of the Eastern soil, he had his primary education at Kalmunai Weley High School and thus in his formative years, developed a strong bond with the Tamils. He had to leave his home region to pursue further studies at the metropolis.
In 1970, he joined the Law College where he excelled and manifested prowess in the field of Constitutional Law by writing the first book on Constitutional Law in Tamil with particular reference to 1972 Republican Constitution of Sri Lanka. At the Ceylon Law College, the natural nursery of many a political leader, he was the President of the Law Students Muslim Majils and of the Tamil Mantram and was an influential member of the student community, nearly missing the coveted position of President of the Law Students Union.
In 1974, he joined the Attorney Generals Department as a State Counsel and worked there to get himself acquainted with the law to become an eminent lawyer. He practiced in Kalumai and Batticaloa. He completed the Masters Degree in Law prior to becoming a senior minister. He was honoured with title President's Counsel.
People, particularly in the Eastern province, reaped the whirlwind Ashraff for he gave them what no other leader has given them in such a short period. The late Minister Ashraff was first and foremost a humane person. But he had a strong will and sense of justice which spurred him to give his people their just in the political, social and economic firmament. The Late Minister Ashraff entered Parliament in 1989. He formed the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress. As the leader of the party, he extended his cooperation to the Late President R. Premadasa, although he was in the opposition. He maintained a cordial relationship with the President to win back the rights of the Muslim community. Ashraff never tolerated injustice and discrimination meted out to minorities.
His dedicated efforts have transformed his home district of Ampara from a backward, rural district into a fairly developed area, moving rapidly towards modernism. He single-handedly dedicated to establishing the South Eastern University, which will be recorded in letters of gold. His struggle to obtain the rights of Muslims had much success during the last six years.
He had a vast following among the Muslim people who appreciated his vision, the immense sacrifices he made for their cause and his sincerity of purpose. A good administrator should be a good human being. Despite all the knowledge and techniques of administration and management, one cannot be a good administrator unless one has good qualities coupled with attractive talents in ample measure. He did not cultivate these qualities but they were part of his nature. His experience in the political field enriched his administrative acumen and came in handy. The Eastern Province saw development through the late Leader Ashraff in a short period of six years.
Ashraff did a yeoman service to elevate the Colombo Port as one of the best in Asia. He rapidly started reforms in the harbour once he took charge of the ministry. The minister established a marine training institution at Oluvil and planned to construct a harbour. His gift of a lighthouse at Oluvil majestically stands to give a ray of hope to the unemployed youth of the region. No Muslim leader will be cherished and remembered as Ashraff due to his achievements at the South Eastern University.
Ferial Ashraff, his spouse and former Minister of Housing Construction was always in the background. Then suddenly with his tragic death, she was pushed into that same arena of politics and now she had retired from politics. Aman Ashraff is their only son who follows in his fathers footsteps.
May Allah bless him! Jennathul Firdhouse Ameen!
Ashraff A. Samad

Rev. Fr. Dr. J. Alex Ranasinghe 
Guiding light
He was a man of learning,proficient in Asian history and imbibed with high principlesand lofty ideals. He alwayshad a deep sense of the dignityof his vocation. He had a knackfor making friends,cultured always, bright and cheerful. He was indeed one of the delightful companions who kept companywith his ready wit and humour
It is 32 years since Rev. Dr. J. Alex Ranasinghe entered eternal glory to be with his maker. September 21 was his death anniversary.
He was at the Priest Residence, St. Joseph Church Uyana, Moratuwa. He was a former resident of the church from 1981 to 1985. Rev. Fr. was a dedicated pastor, erudite scholar and educationist - all of which have harmoniously blended admirably in the life of Rev. Fr. Dr. Ranasinghe. Cherished memories of this lovable personality linger in my mind as I contribute these lines in appreciation of him.
He was a man of learning, proficient in Asian history and imbibed with high principles and lofty ideals. He always had a deep sense of the dignity of his vocation. He had a knack for making friends, cultured always, bright and cheerful. He was indeed one of the delightful companions who kept company with his ready wit and humour.
The poor and needy, within and outside his parish, benefited from his munificence, irrespective of caste, creed or race. He was always at the service of the people, regardless of time. From my personal knowledge of him, I am aware that he was a source of comfort and solace for the sick, the possessed and the bereaved.
Every Wednesday and Friday, crowds gathered at his Mission House to seek his prayers and blessing. He prayed for the sick, exorcised the possessed and obtained for them relief and solace.
Father Alex held a double doctorate in education and anthropology from the Catholic University of Washington DC. He also served as a delegate at the UNO and UNESCO, bringing credit to Sri Lanka.
He also served as a lecturer for Asian students in the graduate school of the University of Santo Thomas in Manila. While in the USA, he served as a Professor and Chaplain at the Ohio University in Athena, Ohio. Later, he served as a priest at the immaculate conception church in Yuma, Arizona. He was also the prime cover of the Yuma area Greater Ministerial Association.
In appreciation of his laudable services in Yuma Arizona, James P. Dayo, the Mayor proclaimed July 22, 1971, as 'Father Alex Day'.
Let me wind up my tribute to dear pastor and guide with these lines:
ln faithful service at Duty's call
He shepherds his flock one and all,
A guiding light, a helping hand,
A mind that ever did understand,
Making life's path easy always in his inimitable way.

Carina Antoinette Maryanne Corea: 
Caring hostess
She was initially employed as an assistant in the Economics Research Unit ofthe Daily News and was later appointeda Sub-Editor ofthe Ceylon Observer
Carina Antoinette Maryanne Corea was the only child of the late Dr. and Mrs. de Sampayo. She was popularly known as Toni by all.
Toni was born on October 23, 1934. She had her early education in several government schools because her father was a transferable government servant. She completed her education at Holy Family Convent, Bambalapitiya and entered the Ceylon University where she studied for two years.
She was initially employed as an assistant in the Economics Research Unit of the Daily News and was later appointed a Sub-Editor of the Ceylon Observer.
She subsequently went on vacation to the United Kingdom, where she met and married her husband Malcolm Corea in the early sixties. She followed a course in textile designing in the UK. They returned to Sri Lanka in 1969 and Mr. Corea passed away in 2006.
For many years, Malcolm and Toni were cared for by a long and caring couple. Since Malcolm and Toni had no children, they adopted two boys, Suresh and Prakash, whom they cared for like their own children, and had them educated at St. Peters College, Colombo.
Toni was a soft-spoken, gentle, compassionate, caring and loving person. She was always meticulously dressed and visitors were always welcomed to her home at Lucky Plaza.
On the morning of her demise, we were summoned to her home as she had been quite restless and in pain from the early hours of the morning. However, by the time we rushed to see her, Toni had already breathed her last and had passed away peacefully. We at Lucky Plaza are going to miss Toni very much indeed.
May her soul rest in peace and rise in glory!

Dr. Shanmuganathan: 
Brilliant doctor
Dr. Shanmuganathan was awarded B.Sc (Special Degree) with First Class Honours in 1950 from the University of Ceylon.
He was a recipient of the Bhikaji Framji Khan Gold Medal for the best performance at the Special Degree examination in Chemistry, University of Ceylon. He joined the Medical Research Institute (MRI) in 1951 and proceeded to Sheffield University U.K. for his Ph.D. He returned to Sri Lanka and assumed duties at the Biochemistry Section of the MRI.
It was felt that middle-level technical personnel in many institutions do not have opportunities for further education and training. Dr. Shanmuganathan recognized this gap and pioneered the initiation of the Laboratory Technician Certificate Course (LTTC) in 1972. Subsequently, this was upgraded to a Diploma in Laboratory Technology in Chemistry (DLTC). This course was conducted at Aquinas College of Higher Education until it was moved to the Institute of Chemistry Ceylon building, Adamantane House at Rajagiriya.
As a tribute to Dr. Shanmuganathan, I am pleased that the annual intake for this course is over 100. The course assists private sector laboratory personnel to obtain training and qualification for accreditation of the respective laboratory for accreditation under ISO/IEC 17025.
Dr. Shanmuganathan was a visiting lecturer in Biochemistry at the University of Ceylon. In the academic year 1969/1970, he supervised my seminar topic which was on Colorimetry. At that time, this was a new topic because the laboratory courses were on gravimetry and titrimetry only. He requested me to carry out references at the library of MRI. After the seminar presentation, I was inspired by Dr. Shanmuganathan and interested in practicing colorimetry with my colleague Dr. S. Hettiarachchi. We found an old Hilger machine at the Physical Chemistry Laboratory. We tried to obtain colorimetric results but failed. We went to CISIR and mentioned our failure to Dr. M. A. V. Devanathan and he said the machine is a fluorimeter and not a colorimeter!
May lord rest his soul in peace!

Atale Estate gets more foreign offers for latex pale crepe
Atale Estate of Kegalle Plantation PLC, a subsidiary of Arpico Group is considering an offer of making latex pale crepe for the Nike Shoe Company.
Superintendent Atale Estate Lakshman Amaratunga said that a team from the Nike shoes factory from China visited them recently and toured the factory to get firsthand information of their operations. He said that this visit was arranged by the Export Development Board and the Nike officials were pleased with the standard of the factory.
Amaratunga said that the factory which was built over 100 years ago by the British currently manufactures latex pale Crepe to Clark Shoe Company of London for the past 25 years and exporters though MPI Holdings Vietnam. We are now looking at more exports to other countries.
He also said that the Atale Estate factory would go in for a major automation program soon and is looking at an investment of around Rs. 4 million for this. Unfortunately unlike several other industries very little R&D is being done globally towards automation in this sector and this is a hinder to our progress.
He said that in a bid to increase rubber production Atale Estate of Kegalle Plantation PLC, would invest around RS. 4.2 million next year for replanting program. (SS)

Atale Estate set to post highest net profit
The 100 year old of Kegalle Plantation PLC, is set to create financial history by posting the highest ever net profit of Rs. 20 million by the end of the year. This was Rs. 11 million last year.
Superintendent Atale Estate Lakshman Amaratunga a subsidiary of Arpico Group said that new management tools, the US dollar appreciation and high prices in the global market for their products has helped the increase in profits. We are also expecting a record crop this year as well.
He said that the Atale Estate which has over 2500 acres was given on a long lease by the Janatha Estate Development Board under the then government restructuring program in 1993. The ownership of the Company changed during the latter part of 1995 when the Government sold 20% of the shares it held to the public and the majority stake of 51% to RPK Management Services (Pvt) Limited.
It also gifted 10% or 2 million shares to over 8,000 eligible employees. In May 1997 the Government sold further 19% shares it held through the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), to the public and thereby, totally exited from the ownership of Kegalle Plantations PLC.
Today Kegalle Plantations PLC is the largest rubber producing company among the Regional Plantation Companies accounting for 4.0 million kg of average production per annum. It also supplies their products to Arpico and several other local tyre manufactures.
He said that he joined Atale Estate in 2010 and launched a major restructuring program. Under this program for the first time coconut was also planted and now the company has also invested Aga Wood and Palm oil as well. This is to have a plantation mix rather than depending only on one crop.
Atale Estate invested over Rs. 20 million for the project so far. To date Atale Estate is the only Estate in Kegalle Plantations PLC to have Palm oil of 30 hectares.
The company also launched a major CSR initiative by providing land and single housing units to their laborers moving them out of the line room culture. For this endeavor Atale Estate won a merit award at the annual competition for the Estate Worker Housing Cooperative Society conducted by the Plantation Human Development Trust held in 2014 at Ministry of Disaster Management.
He said they built 110 single unit house and the estate would provide 7 perches each for this. The Indian government too has come up with a credit line to fund this project of which 40% has now being completed.
Another significant achievement made by Atale Estate under guidance from Superintendent Atale Estate Lakshman Amaratunga is that deviating from the current trend of estate youth seeking employment in the apparel sector, about 20 women from the neighboring villages and from the estate, who were employed in the apparel sector left and joined Atale Estates sole crepe factory as a conducive environment has been created.
For this Atale Estate of Kegalle Plantations PLC received the prestigious Gold Award under Large Scale, Estate sector in recognizing the contributions made to maintain very high standard of Social Dialogue and Work Place Corporation.
In addition we also have a banking arm for the estate to provide them with loan facilities for any need under very flexible interest rates. This program has also won several awards.
The safety of workers too have been increased work atmosphere along with facilities for workers too have got the management attention.
In a bid to save electricity the company has also introduced a special lighting system in the roof and this initiative helped the Atale Estate to win a Green Energy award.
For this Atale Estate received the prestigious Gold Award under Large Scale, Estate sector in recognizing the contributions made to maintain very high standard of Social Dialogue and Work Place Corporation.
Atale Estate also won the Silver Category Award at the National Chamber of Exporters of Sri Lanka 25th (NCE) Export Awards 2017 at the Hilton Colombo. This prestigious award was presented under Agriculture Bulk, Rubber Products Sub Sector category in recognition of export performance in 2016.
Selected by an eminent panel of judges, the award recognizes the efforts made by the company to positively impact the nations export sector. Atale Estate is the first regional plantation company estate to obtain this prestigious NCE Export Award and this is the second consecutive year this prestigious award has been won by Atale Estate.

Bangladesh beat Afghanistan  in last ball finish
ABU DHABI Sunday: Bangladesh paceman Mustafizur Rahman held his nerves to bowl a final dot ball in the 50th over to give his team a nerve-wracking three-run win over Afghanistan in Abu Dhabi on Sunday.
Needing eight to win off the 50th over Afghanistan lost Rashid Khan for five off the second ball while Samiullah Shinwari (23 not out)and Gulbadin Naib managed just two leg byes to finish at 246-7.
Bangladesh had made 249-7 on the back of half centuries from Mahmudullah Riyad and Imrul Kayes at the Sheik Zayed Stadium.
The Bangladesh win meant India sailed into the September 28 final in Dubai while Pakistan and Bangladesh meet in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday to decide the second finalist.
India thumped Pakistan by nine wickets in a one-sided match in Dubai on Sunday.
Afghanistan were helped to their total with a 99-ball 71 by Hashmatullah Shahidi who hit five boundaries while opener Mohammad Shahzad made an 81-ball 53 with eight boundaries. Skipper Asghar Afghan (39) and Mohammad Nabi (38) made useful contributions but the asking rate climed to mount presure in the final over.
Earlier, Riyad scored an 81-ball 74 with two sixes and three boundaries while Kayes -- recalled as a back-up to strengthen the batting -- made an 89 ball 72 not out to help Bangladesh recover from a precarious 5-87.Opener Liton Das scored 41 and Mushfiqur Rahim made 33 but Bangaldesh - who won the toss and batted -- owed their total to a solid 128-run stand for the sixth wicket between Riyad and Kayes.
Kayes gave good support to Riyad as the two built the innings after Bangladeshs star batsman Shakib Al Hasan was run out for nought.
Kayes hit six boundaries as Bangladesh played the dangerous spinning duo of Rashid Khan and Mujeeb Ur Rahman who managed a wicket each.

Beatles' Let It Be film set for 2020 revamp
The Beatles' Let It Be movie is to be remastered and re-released for its 50th anniversary in 2020, according to Paul McCartney.
Director Michael Lindsay-Hogg's film, which documented the making of the Fab Four's final studio album Let It Be, was released in 1970.
It featured the iconic footage from the group's 1969 concert on the roof of their Apple Corps headquarters in London.
McCartney has now revealed there are plans to mark the film's 50th anniversary with a new DVD/Blu-Ray release, which will feature never-before-seen footage.
"I think there may be a new version of it," he told Canadas Radio X.
"That is kind of the latest gossip. We keep talking about it. We have meetings at Apple, you know, the original Beatles Apple. And its one of the things you never quite know whats gonna happen with it... I keep saying, 'Whats gonna happen, because people ask about it. I tell you what I think - its gonna happen. I think there may be a new version of it... Theres a lot of footage, and the original movie came out, and it was really sort of about the break-up of The Beatles. And so, for me, it was a little sad, the movie. But I know people have been looking at the (unreleased) footage - theres about 56 hours of footage. Someone was talking to me the other day and said, 'The overall feeling is very joyous and very uplifting. Its like a bunch of guys making music and enjoying it'. So I think there is some talk about making a new movie, re-editing it from the same period, from the same footage. We can make a new film out of it. So who knows, that may be happening in a year or two."

Johnny English Strikes Again begins when a cyberattack in M.I 6 reveals the identities of all active undercover agents in Britain, leaving Johnny English (Rowan Atkinson) as the secret services last hope.
Called out of retirement, English dives headfirst into action with the mission to find the mastermind hacker.
As a man with few skills and old school crime-solving methods, Johnny English must overcome the challenges of modern technology and his constant clumsiness to make this mission a success.
Riding on the funniness of British comedy maestro Atkinson, the film casts Olga Kurylenko (The Death of Stalin, Oblivion), Emma Thompson (Beauty and the Beast, Men in Black 3) and Ben Miller (Paddington 2).

Why not a Nagara Peraliya
In the city of Colombo on every road, street, lane or passage the following are never removed.
CTB season ticket issuing rusty shelters that are abandoned.
CEB area power supplying unused steel compartments.
Unused SLT concrete posts lying idle.
CMC steel lamp posts that are being unused and corroded at the base. Wherever projects or repairs were done, specially on roads and pavements, debris, unused materials etc. not being removed. Over- grown trees are not trimmed and tree trunks have not been removed.
Residents collecting debris and other waste products near their homes have not been cleared. Broken, rusty, dismantled bikes, three-wheelers, cars and even lorries being parked near houses. Unused and abandoned business carts blocking the pavements with no trace of the owners.
And so many other eye-sores like blocked roadside drains etc.
The simple question I would wish to ask is as to whose responsibility it is to look into these things I don't think Mayors and Commissioners would have ever thought it to be their part of duty. May be they would have assumed that the five District Offices with a few engineers to each office handling their part of duty would attend to the necessities of Colombo city. These engineers do not care at all to see at least the basic requirement of repairing the pot-holes, pavements and street lamps are done in the areas allocated to them. Since the demise of President Premadasa, the sad plight of the CMC continues.
Now the members of the CMC have increased manifold. Enjoying everything on our tax contribution. No fuss! Why cannot groups of members join together and attend to the above mentioned shortcomings with the support of the area people and of those who walked behind them during the canvassing period. Cannot a name like Nagara Peraliya be introduced to improve the Colombo city also

Is a collaboration between Christina and Britney coming
If you're on social media, you would know that some say that it is negative and promotes more harm than good.
However, not Christina Aguilera. She believes that it has the power to promote 'good', and can even help squash 'beef' between people.
During an interview on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live', she said that she wished social media was around during her day so she could clear the air that there was no bad blood between her and Britney Spears.She even added that they should have done a song together to help squash the rumours. Jimmy Kimmel then asked if a duet was still possible, to which 'Xtina' replied: "Its probably not too late for that.  If her reps say okay Hey, Im down.
No news on whether Britney is down for a duet, but if she is, we're guaranteed that it will be a chart-topper.

COZA Ceylon Mount Lavinia to get three star status
The newly opened COZA Ceylon Mount Lavinia will be reinvesting Rs. 30 million to add six more rooms and introduce other facilities.
A joint venture between two entrepreneurs from Sri Lanka and Japan, A. L. A. Subahan and Asami Morita are joint Chairman of the property.
Having started as an employee at a Kandy hotel, Subahan then gained employment at Dubai and later moved to Japan. I then worked for twelve years in a five star hotel in Japan and subsequently started my own Restaurant Kiri Pani inTokyo.
Due to the love for the country I came back to Sri Lanka and invested around Rs. 70 million jointly with Asami Morita to start COZA Mount Lavinia with an investment of Rs. 100 million.
The hotel now offers 6 rooms and a roof top swimming pool. In addition the hotel is looking at obtaining three star classification from Sri Lanka Tourism. We have already applied and inspections have been completed, A. L. A. Subahan said.
He also said that they have six luxury rooms with all modern facilities and most of the equipment has been imported from Japan. During the season we were overbooked and due to this we are now looking at adding six more economy rooms by next year, he said.
Subahan said that they are also offering a special two hour Spa treatment as a part of the hotel package even for guests who check in on a bed and breakfast package and this is very popular.
In addition, the hotel also offers special Yoga classes for outside guests as well while Asami Morita conducts special Japanese Reiki healing therapy treatment for women.
He added that most of their guests are European and Japanese and also they have a very steady local outstation clientele who patronize the hotel. COZA Ceylon also arranges city tours, airport pick and drops and excursions to all over Sri Lanka.
The roof top pool area is also given out for corporate get-togethers and special private parties and could accommodate nearly 50 guests.

The delegation will visit Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin and meet with senior German officials, as well as captains of German industry. The Sri Lankan delegation will comprise Senior officials involved in vital aspects of the economy including Mr. Mangala Yapa, Board Member of the Board of Investment of Sri Lanka (BOI), Mr. Duminda Ariyasinghe, Director General of the BOI, Mrs. Indira Malwatte, Chairperson/ Chief Executive of the Export Development Board as well as other senior officials of the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade. This delegation will also include representatives from leading Sri Lankan Companies which have an interest in Germany, as well as officials from the German Chamber of Industry and Commerce (AHK).
Germany is of considerable importance to Sri Lanka as it is the largest economy within the European Union and also a dynamo in the manufacturing sector which is a focus sector for Sri Lanka. In addition, Germany is also a leader in the field of logistics notably in Hamburg and software knowledge services including state of the art incubator services which are centered in Berlin.
This highly targeted mission will include investment forums where top German and Sri Lankan companies can share experiences, and presentations by the BOI and the EDB will be conducted.

Germany has taken a strategic interest in investing Sri Lanka as the Government policy actively encourages private sector led growth. This is reflected by the decision of AHK to open a full time office in Colombo in March 2018 in support of expanding investment and trade from Germany to Sri Lanka.
The forums are to be held in the Chambers of Commerce in Frankfurt, Hamburg and Berlin.

Meet gutsy Afghanistan in final Super Four match
Dress rehearsal for India ahead of final
DUBAI, Monday  India the only unbeaten side in the ongoing Asia Cup cricket tournament and the first team to qualify for Fridays final take on Afghanistan in their final Super Four match at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Tuesday.
India booked their place in the final with an emphatic nine-wicket win over arch rivals Pakistan on Sunday leaving the other finalists berth to be fought out between Pakistan and Bangladesh who will meet in the final Super Four match at Abu Dhabi on Wednesday.
Afghanistan the most improved side among the minnows nearly caused an upset when they came within three runs of defeating Bangladesh on Sunday.
Their loss which was the second in the Super Four knocks them out of the final and todays contest against India will be one of playing for pride. This will be the first time that Afghanistan will be playing in Dubai having played all their previous games in Abu Dhabi.
India on the other hand have a big advantage over their rivals as they have played all their matches of the ongoing Asia Cup at Dubai and know the conditions and the pitch very well.
Although todays game is more or less a dead rubber nevertheless India will be keen to retain their unbeaten record going into the final.
The mood in the dressing room is positive as we started with a tough win against Hong Kong. We have not lost a match in the series so far, and we have beaten Pakistan twice, that is great for our confidence leading up to Fridays final, said Indian spinner Yuzvendra Chahal looking ahead at todays game.
Afghanistans captain Asghar Afghan said: It was a painful game. 8 off 6 is not difficult because Rashid, Nabi, Shenwari can do it. But I will give credit to Mustafiz (Rahman), he bowled his variations. Everything was going to plan. Again we lost in the last over, the batsmen going for big shots at the end, didnt work. We have learnt a lot, especially because we are playing against full-members.
Although out of the final Afghanistan have every reason to be proud of their performance in the Asia Cup giving all the countries a tough run before losing, the highlight of their achievements being their thumping 91-run win over former World Cup and Asia Cup champions Sri Lanka.

Every era has good and bad work
Mitron starring Jackky Bhagnani and Kritika Kamra is up for release on September 14. The team of the film is busy with promotions of this comedy caper. At the song launch of Kamariya, many of the films singers were present. Singer Sonu Nigam, who was also present, sang Door Na Jaa a romantic melody from Mitron.
Sonu Nigam was asked what he misses most from the time he started his singing career to today, as he has seen a lot of changes in the Indian music industry. He said, People who miss something from the past are people who dont enjoy the present. I dont miss anything, as living in the past is egoistic. People at times say that humare zamane mein aisa hota tha, aur waisa hota tha (our times were different) that the music they made in their times was better, and what kind of music is being made today! This is a wrong tendency. Every era has its own memorable moments, every era has good and bad work, every era has its advantages and disadvantages.
The 45-year-old singer than shared a few highlights from his long-standing celebrated career. He said, I think I am the only one from this generation who can say that they have had the honour of working with legends like Salil Choudhary, Anil Biswas, Laxmikant-Pyarelal, and now these guys for Mitron. So there is nothing good or bad, really.
He then spoke about how he used to record music then, and what are the technical changes that have occurred now.
There was also a time when I used to sing in Mehboob Studio, with 100- 150 people playing different musical instruments live, and we used to sing live. There was no place for mistakes as we would have to record the whole thing again. Now the time is such that we can sing one part now and other later, or sing better later on. That was a time when we had to sing in a single take, now we have the freedom to take our time, and make changes. I have enjoyed that time also, and I am enjoying this time also. I like reinventing myself and keep myself updated and relevant for the time that is.
Mitron is scheduled to release on September 14, 2018.

Extra-ordinary times warrant extra-ordinary measures
" Agriculture has the potential to increase the GDP in the short run. At present 60 percent of the agricultural produce is lost due to wastage and attacks by animals. Transport and processing costs should be lowered by the application of new technology and other means to give relief to both the producer and the consumer. For example, the gap between the cost price of the paddy farmer and the buying price of rice of the consumer is too great. Perhaps the traders and processing entrepreneurs may be reaping possibly a super profit"
The Sri Lankan Rupee is sliding. It is Rs. 170 to a dollar at the time of writing this column. It may slide further by the time you read it. On January 1, 2018 it was only Rs. 150 to a dollar. That means a 13.3 percent devaluation in the last 8 months. It is apprehensive to speculate on when and at what point it would stabilize.
External causes are mainly responsible for this situation. The trade war initiated by the United States against China, EU, Canada and Mexico has caused the commodities produced by these countries more expensive and US goods relatively cheaper. Besides the United States has imposed sanctions on Iran and Russia and it penalizes even third countries for trading with those countries. Thus, the rule-based international trading system is disturbed. The demand for the dollar has increased causing it to appreciate vis--vis other currencies.
In addition, Sri Lankas trade deficit has widened on account of the value of imports exceeding that of exports. In 2017 Sri Lankas trade deficit reached US $ 9.4 billion. It is expected to be around US $ 10 billion this year. This is despite a slight increase in exports. The volatile situation in the Middle East and sanctions on Iran have caused world oil prices to swell. It is another factor pushing up import costs.
Expatriate workers
Trade deficit is mainly responsible for the weak balance of payments. The decrease in remittances from expatriate workers in the Middle East also contributes to this situation.
In this context it is obvious that our economy is in dire straits. Added to all these woes is the debt burden. Sri Lanka has to spend almost 90 percent of its income to pay foreign debts. Thus, almost the entire surplus product of the country is spent on debt payment and debt servicing. Next year when the grace period of several large loans expires it will increase exponentially.
Whatever benefits we accrue from export orientation are absorbed by the donor countries and agencies and we remain a pauper as before. Without replenishing our external reserves, without increasing domestic production and savings it is difficult to prevent the slide of the Rupee by temporary measures.
The devaluation of the Rupee is accompanied by a meteoric rise in the cost of living where the lower income population will find it difficult to make ends meet. The middle classes would slide down into indebtedness.
This is an unprecedented and an extra-ordinary situation. Unfortunately, its gravity has not being understood by the Government and political leaders.
They are merrily engaged in comic soap operas oblivious to the impending disaster. They are fighting over language and religion when the very physical existence of the poor is threatened with death by starvation, deprivation, want and curable diseases. They are like crabs dancing in the boiling water.
Extra-ordinary times warrant extra-ordinary measures. Sri Lanka should negotiate and attract FDI selectively and invest them in productive industries leaving aside cosmetic and some infrastructure projects for the time being. For example, the Kurunegala - Habarana new railway project could be postponed. Priority should be given to projects to overcome harmful effects of drought and floods and develop food production. Similarly, the destructive proposal to build a leisure zone for foreigners and the local rich and the novae rich by reclaiming a large area from the sea from Colombo to Ratmalana should be abandoned. Much more urgent is to eradicate or reduce alarming malnutrition among children under five years which has increased on a mass scale.
All non-essential imports should be curtailed or heavily taxed. This should include first of all motor vehicles for personal use. The same goes for gold imports. Fruits and vegetables that are imported could be discouraged. As far as possible import substitution industries should be started selectively without considering it a dirty practice as defined in the neoliberal lexicon.
Agriculture has the potential to increase the GDP in the short run. At present 60 percent of the agricultural produce is lost due to wastage and attacks by animals. Transport and processing costs should be lowered by the application of new technology and other means to give relief to both the producer and the consumer. For example, the gap between the cost price of the paddy farmer and the buying price of rice of the consumer is too great. Perhaps the traders and processing entrepreneurs may be reaping possibly a super profit. Improving communications and knowledge among the farmers could help reduce the seasonal gluts and scarcities in the vegetable market. A wide agricultural extension service could help in this matter.
Essential goods
A safety net should be provided to the low-income groups by way of a package of essential goods including, rice, coconuts, dhal, dried fish etc. at a subsidized price under a ration system. Rationing, subsidies etc. are emergency measures to be resorted to in emergencies. Economic planners should find out ways and means of finding the extra money needed by suitable income tax and saving measures.
We often hear of appeals to the public to tighten their belts. Unfortunately, it goes with the rich and the powerful fattening themselves through opulence. There is no equitable distribution of sacrifice. While working people are asked to bear difficulties with existing low salaries, proposals were mooted to increase those of the parliamentarians. While people suffer from deprivation Provincial Councillors decide to use chairs worth more than Rs. 800,000 to cushion their posterior. Cabinet and other Ministers number more than 100 and new ones join them at regular intervals heaping an enormous maintenance expense on the public. Yet often the House is adjourned for want of a quorum.
Extra-ordinary measures do not mean declaring a State of Emergency or mobilizing the armed forces (regular as well as voluntary) for active service. On the other hand, it means mobilizing the masses for the implementation of the extra-ordinary measures.

Field notes from a JICA media tour
At the Kawashima Compost Plant outside of Kandy, journalists file out of the Japanese Embassy bus and obligingly wade through the stench of rotting vegetables. While the journalists reflexively put their hands to their noses, the plants workers hardly notice the smell anymore. Most discard their face masks as they sift through mounds of fly-ridden, decaying organic matter, in rubber boots.
A man in a crisp white shirt, Dr. Satha, greets the journalists in Sinhala and English. He works for the local government, and tells them how Japanese technology is indirectly bettering their local community, while behind him, a woman in a black sari looks down, listening. He instructs her to translate his words for the Daily News in English. Her name is Harshini.
Wada, a JICA volunteer who speaks both Tamil and Sinhala, supports the environmental education efforts of the Batticaloa Municipal Council.
Harshini is the plants Project Supervisor. She comes to work every day at 7 am, and Dr. Satha comes in three or four hours later. She oversees the functioning of the plant, and he acts as a coordinator between the plant and local government.
Harshini explains how, in 2016, the Japan International Cooperation Agency (JICA) introduced screw technologies into the compost process in Sri Lanka, funding the instillation of large drills at the plant that swirl organic matter, helping it decay faster and creating a more efficient and sustainable compost operation.
It works three times faster than normal fertiliser, says Harshini, and she leads the Daily News towards the processing section of the plant, where she puts her hand under a sieve, collecting a handful of what looks like smooth black dirt.
Operating the sieve is Harshinis mother, Indrani, who has been working at the plant for one and a half years. Indrani says she doesnt mind her job. For eight hours a day, she shovels compost into a sieve, where unsorted bits of plastic are finally weeded out, to produce an almost finished fertiliser. Harshini says that every one tonne of decomposing organic matter sieves out to approximately 580 grams of compost.
Compost, she says, helps the community reduce and reuse their organic waste, which cleans up the city, and provides rich fertiliser to farmers in the Nuwara Eliya region. Farmers get more revenue, says Harshini.
Back with the other journalists, Dr. Satha is describing how the plant itself is getting more revenue now too. About two months ago, the Kawashima Plant began making surplus profit for the first time. In the past few months it has made a total of Rs. 800,000, which, after paying employees and operational costs, amounts to a surplus of Rs. 250,000, selling each of their 1kg packets for some Rs. 20.
After some time walking around the plant, the journalists filed back onto the bus, breathing a sigh of relief for the sterile, air conditioned air, and journeying to the next site on the three-day media tour.
Each year, the Japanese Embassy and JICA, Japans bilateral aid implementation agency, take the media on a tour of the countrys investments and operations in Sri Lanka. The Japanese Embassy treats the media as its guests, bears the expenses of all their meals and accommodations for three days, in return for coverage of its various projects: the Warakapola Base Hospital, Kandy Water Treatment Plant, the Kandy Nursing School (where JICA has funded disaster mitigation technology), the Maha Oya Water Treatment Plant, and the Manmunai Bridge. In addition, JICA sponsors 72 Japanese volunteers who work across the country. The volunteers are trained in Sinhala or Tamil and contribute towards deepening socioeconomic, cultural, and personal relationships between Japan and Sri Lanka.
One of the JICA volunteers that the media visited was Kazuya Yagi, who is a baseball coach for different public schools in Kandy, and speaks Sinhala to train about 200 players in total. JICA was eager to highlight his and his players achievements for having taken part in the West Asia Baseball Cup in Islamabad, Pakistan, in 2017.
On the tour, Yagi led a practice for the journalists and Japanese embassy officials, to show off the talent of the young boys. Meanwhile, the schools young girls were forced to observe, standing in unruffled white uniforms as their male peers played catch with each other and Yagi. The female principal of the same school, who stood with her pupils, said that they had just started a girls baseball team too, but so far the girls arent very good. In explanation as to why little investment had been made in training the female players, she said, Sri Lanka doesnt have a womens baseball team.
One of the more disarming aspects of the annual Japanese media tour was the juxtaposition between JICAs purpose in Sri Lanka and a gendered society: the tour was about emphasising the time and financial commitment Japan has made in Sri Lanka, but many situations spoke instead of a lack of commitment being made to support women and girls.
The lack of social investment in gender equality was more apparent in this context than it might have been otherwise, because of the contrasting emphasis on Japans social and financial investments. At the same time, this culture of inequality was reflected even on the media bus, where, of more than 20 multimedia and print journalists, Japanese officials and drivers, only two people on the tour were women.
On the final day of the tour, journalists were huddled into the auditorium of a government Tamil School, one of the leading girls schools in Batticaloa, where Satomi Wada taught a lesson in environmental education. Wada, a JICA volunteer who speaks both Tamil and Sinhala, supports the environmental education efforts of the Batticaloa Municipal Council.
She explained to a room of 10-year-olds and adult journalists alike the meaning of waste segregation on multiple levels: what is biodegradable organic matter, what can and cannot be composted, what happens when organic matter is left in landfills. Admittedly, the lesson was lengthy and geared towards the young students in the room. As a result, many of the journalists drifted in and out of the room, some saying it was a waste of time. But it was also the only event throughout the entire three-day tour which was led solely by a woman.
Afterwards, the bus of journalists visited the Batticaloa Municipal Council. There, Municipal Commissioner Nagarasa Manivannan, Batticaloa Mayor Thiagaraja Saravanapavan, along with two male JICA officials, and one woman who was never introduced and who never spoke, conducted a panel discussion on their environmental education efforts. The same journalists who had listened to Wada restlessly only half an hour before, now sat in rapt silence, affording the predominantly male panel more respect and attention than they had Wadas lesson.
There are many possible explanations for this difference: the municipal panels discussion was more interesting to the journalists than the lesson, or the journalists paid more attention because they received snacks during the municipal council discussion, or maybe it had something to do with the fact that now an important man was speaking.
When she came to Batticaloa, it was the peak period of this garbage issue, Manivannan said.
At that time, the community used to manage garbage simply by burning it, releasing polluting chemicals into the air, water, and soil. Now, he said, Wada conducts programmes at the school and within the community. Based on her performance and the quality of the programmes, others requested her as well.
The reality that day was that Manivannan, Sri Lankas male JICA officials, and a group of primarily male reporters were responsible for determining Wadas importance. This was also the final event of the media tour, and so, the gender disparity that had been present throughout was merely compounded.

Final Score: Goal without score
Can we simply sit back and chill when the world is in shambles Forget the Rupee depreciation, crime wave and Trump playing havoc on the world scene, and here we are, going on with our merriments. On the other hand, what else can we do Even if are fully privy to the tragic circumstances of our surrounding, we are in no position to undo or rectify any of them.
That principle seems to govern Scott Manns Final Score.
The place is London. The event is a soccer match. Duration Apparently 90 minutes! Set amid such a sporty occasion, we are transported to a forceful meditation between entertainment and enigma. A gang of terrorists kidnap the niece of a one-time war warrior with the incredible hulk-like physique and deadly combating skills who moves heaven and earth to set things right.
The battle between Michael Knox, the one-time war warrior, and the terrorist gang is full of clichs as well as thrillingly fresh perspectives. It reaches various culminations before the soccer match is over. Interestingly the soccer fans are blissfully oblivious to all what happens just around them. Even a warning from a janitor would hardly disturb their cheery mood.
This duration of 90 minutes is decisive as we get to experience dreadful deaths and assaults. The soccer game is in the full swing with the fans revelling in it, yet the audience behind the screen has to come to terms with the reality: the stadium will be demolished at some point. That striking phenomenon offers Scott Mann ample opportunity to exercise his imagination in action.
Final Score has more clichs than fresh perspectives for an action genre enthusiast. They will find less to indulge in this template. Yet the movie is not short of some thrilling nuances.
The plot offers a delicious episode as Knoxs comrade enters the scene. Quite untypical of action movies, this character does not fear the gun. Not only he seems seasoned in gunfights, but he does not dread the weapon when it is aimed at him. He remains calm and sticks to that composure as the plot advances and right up to the moment when he chooses to shoot himself down.
But the disturbing element of the movie lies with the West Ham audience oblivious to the gunfights and other expressive machismo taking place in the surrounding. How would they have possibly escaped the detection when the gunfights reach lethal levels with murders, motorbike chases over the concourse and other insanely gory details of terrorists in action Was that generated on purpose to enhance the contrast between the terror and entertainment
A mention must be made of Michael Knox. The character is not created to make a superhero effect. He falters at times (many times, in fact) only to rise from the very ashes taking a worse beating. But as any of us would guess, the final score is destined to be his.
He is the lead character in action, so the rest of the villains have to be beaten out of the game for our hero to emerge. Though that campaign is heavily at work, Scott Mann has set up quite a few hurdles the superhero to emerge while not to be mistaken as some supernatural hero.
But where does it take us, the audience Michael Knox scores, but without much goal as it was apparent throughout the movie.

Forty-four dengue deaths up to now
The number of dengue deaths reported this year had reached 44 while dengue patients from all parts of the country reached 38,565.
This is according to the statistics received until last Friday, the Epidemiology Sources said.
According to the sources, a 70 percent decrease is reported in dengue cases when compared with the same period last year. The highest number of dengue cases - 7,391  was reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number - 4246  was reported from the Batticaloa district. The third highest number  4,109  was reported in the Gampaha district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,891 dengue cases during the same period.
The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,500 cases. The Western Province reported 13,903 cases, the Epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and should not attend to work or school.
All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. Other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
Premises should be kept clean and free of mosquito breeding sites during this rainy season to prevent dengue.
Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.

Our characters in this film didnt have the opportunities but they had lot of talent and the kind of struggle our characters go through to achieve their goal is truly an inspiring story, she said. The Rab Ne Bana Di Jodi actor said she feels everyone has experienced struggles in their lives.
I believe every individual will connect with this film because we all have experienced struggle in our lives. People will also relate with each character of the film, be it parents, husband or wife in the film.

Game of charades The lackadaisical implementation of price controls on basic foods
The Government has imposed price controls on a number of basic foods in order to control the cost of living. For the purpose of study, we wanted to ascertain the products subject to controls, as well as the prices at which they were supposed to be sold.
A list of price controlled items is a straightforward piece of information that should be readily available to any consumer.
Unfortunately, this does not appear to be available anywhere. The website of the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA) lists a few items; gas, cement, milk powder, chicken, rice, and pharmaceuticals. The other items were not listed.
The information on the CAA website is outdated (eg. A controlled price from 2014 is listed for chicken although chicken was removed from the list of controlled items in April 2017). On inquiring from the CAA over telephone, we were asked to refer to the website. A list was eventually compiled after a field visit to the CAA by extracting the relevant information from copies of the gazettes.
How are price controls to be enforced if a list of items subject to control is not readily available
The proper approach would be to ensure that list of controlled prices is displayed at every outlet, so customers know if they are being overcharged and can then make their purchasing decisions accordingly.
Having compiled a list, we compared the controlled prices with the weekly market prices published by the Department of Census and Statistics in its survey of the main markets in the Colombo district in the period September 1, 2017 to June 30, 2018.
It is evident from the table we have collated that the controlled prices are not being followed in most instances.
The surveys of traders by Breakthrough indicate that 67% of retailers and 46% of wholesalers react to raids by the CAA by temporarily adjusting prices. They later revert to business as usual. Trying to enforce retail level price control across the informal trade and public markets is a practical impossibility. The CAA annual report (2014) states that 22,402 raids were carried out that year and 25,287 in 2013. This is small fraction of 205,573 retail outlets (general as well as those specialised in food, beverages and tobacco) in the country.
In any case if the controlled prices were strictly enforced, then the usual distortions such as shortages and queues would become obvious with unpalatable political consequences.
The CAA is successful in enforcing prices on items supplied by large businesses or corporates such as in cement or milk powder. Whether this actually keeps prices low is questionable.
Large businesses are relatively easy to monitor and they are open to pressure to supply even at a loss; on the implicit understanding that they will be allowed to recoup this at some point, as noted in the articles included in the appendices to this report. It is very clear that the only item consistently being sold at the controlled price is milk powder produced by a multinational. Wheat flour, which is also produced by large corporates tends to track the controlled price closely. The majority of the other items were being traded at prices above the controlled price.
During the period under survey, price controls were imposed on Nadu rice (December 26, 2017) coconuts (December 6) and revised on dhal and kata (December 6) with minimal impact on prices.
The impact of taxes on prices is particularly interesting. (refer charts 5-7). When some taxes were reduced in November 2017 (dhal, potatoes, Big onions), prices declined on these items over period of weeks, sometimes falling below the controlled price. When taxes were later raised (potatoes to Rs.30/kg on February 24, B onions to Rs.40 on May 2) prices rose again eventually breaching the controlled price. In the case of dhal prices eventually fell below the original controlled price (159/kg) following the reduction in tax  but prices did not respond significantly when the controlled prices was reduced to Rs.130 (December 6, 2017).
This underlines the case for reducing specific food taxes if there is any serious intention to control prices.
It is also worth noting the difference in prices between imported and local items, potatoes, and big onions. Locally produced items are not subject to tax or price control, but when available, these retail at prices higher than the controlled price and are sometimes higher than the (taxed) imported items.
Instead of attempting to protect agriculture through taxes (which raises prices for consumers) the government should facilitate the modernisation of the sector, supporting investments that improve productivity (eg. mechanisation, drip irrigation, greenhouses, quality seeds etc).
Addressing the inefficiencies within local agricultural is the sustainable way to lower prices: increased productivity raises farmer incomes and lower consumer prices in the long term.
Using controls to reduce prices does not appear to work.
The scheme itself is ill-conceived and there seems little intent or capacity to enforce. Reducing taxes, increasing competition and productivity in local agriculture is a surer path to lower consumer prices.

Total turnover value amounted to LKR 3.50 Bn (cf. last weeks value of LKR 4.40Bn), while daily average turnover value amounted to LKR 0.70 Bn (-20.33% W-o-W) compared to last weeks average of LKR 0.88Bn. Market capitalization meanwhile, decreased by 2.10% W-o-W (or LKR 59.34 Bn) to LKR 2,773.00 Bn cf. LKR2,832.34 Bn last week.
The Diversified sector was the highest contributor to the weeks total turnover value, accounting for 41.90% (or LKR 1.47Bn) of market turnover. Sector turnover was driven primarily by JKH and Melstacorp which accounted for 95.93% of the sectors total turnover.
The Banks, Finance and Insurance sector meanwhile accounted for 35.55% (or LKR 1.25Bn) of the total turnover value, with turnover driven primarily by Sampath Bank, Commercial Bank, Union Assurance and Seylan Bank which accounted for 80.46% of the sector turnover.
The Manufacturing sector was also amongst the top sectorial contributors, contributing 10.81% (or LKR 0.38Bn) to the market driven by Chevron Lubricants which accounted for 86.44% of the sector turnover.
Liquidity (in Volume Terms)
The Banks,Finance & Insurance sector dominated the market in terms of share volume, accounting for 44.78% (or 45.85Mn shares) of total volume, with a value contribution of LKR 1.25Bn. The Diversified sector followed suit, adding 21.92% to total turnover volume as 22.44Mn shares were exchanged. The sectors volume accounted for LKR 1.47Bn of total market turnover value.

Top Gainers & Losers
Adam Capital was the weeks highest price gainer; increasing 25.0% W-o-W from LKR0.40 to LKR0.50 while Bimputh Finance (+24.1% W-o-W), Swadeshi (+17.0% W-o-W) and Beruwala Resorts (+16.7% W-o-W) were also amongst the top gainers.
Adam Investments was the weeks highest price loser; declining 50.0% W-o-W to close at LKR0.10 while Tess Agro (-33.3% W-o-W), Blue Diamonds [NV] (-33.3% W-o-W) and Good Hope (-23.0% W-o-W) were also amongst the top losers over the week.

In terms of volume, Chevron & Richard Pieris led foreign purchases while JKH & Distilleries led foreign sales.
In terms of value, Chevron & Union Assurance led foreign purchases while JKH & Commercial Bank led foreign sales.
Point of View
Sri Lankan Equities hit a 2-year low as the ASPI dropped below its previous 6,000 point support level. The benchmark index continued to lose ground over the week with the ASPI dipping 126 points (highest weekly drop since Mar2016) to end the week at 5,904.90.
Heavy losses during the week (2.1% W-o-W) dragged the YTD loss on the ASPI further to ~8.0% from 5.9% last week. Despite Japanese investment bank Nomura correcting its report on the outlook for the Sri Lankan rupee, the LKR hit a new all-time low of 170.66 (Selling rate) on Friday and this higher currency depreciation during the week (3.8% W-o-W) remained the major concern for both foreign and local investors.
The negative sentiment surrounding the LKR depreciation was reflected in the weeks activity levels, and weekly turnover during the week declined 20.3% to Rs.3.50bn. Blue-chip JKH remained the largest contributor to the turnover with Rs.1.0Bn, while Sampath Bank and Melstacorp accounted for Rs.0.39Bn each.
Local HNI and Institutional investors were also less interested on equities as crossings for the week accounted for only 32% of the weekly turnover. The foreign equity sell-off on the bourse meanwhile continued as foreign investors recorded a net outflow of Rs.743 Mn cf. Rs.564 Mn last week.
Subsequently, the YTD foreign outflow on the Colombo bourse increased to Rs.5.9Bn (cf. Rs.5.2Bn). Markets in the week ahead are likely to confirm if the new 5900 Index level is the ASPIs new support level or not.
2Q18 GDP growth rises to 3.7% Y-o-Y.
Sri Lankas GDP growth rose to 3.7% Y-o-Y in the 2nd quarter of 2018 (cf. 3.0% Y-o-Y in Q217 and 3.2% in Q118) which led to GDP growth of 3.6% during H118 cf. 3.2% in H117.
An expansion was evident in all three sectors (Agriculture, Industry & Services) with the growth momentum created in 4Q17 continuing on this year in the Agricultural sector (4.9% Y-o-Y in H118 cf. -3.8%) while Service sector growth rose to 4.8% Y-o-Y in H118 (cf. 3.5% Y-o-Y in H12017). Over this quarter, the Agricultural sector recorded the highest growth among all sectors as Growing of Rice recovered with a notable 59.3% Y-o-Y growth over the period (cf. 40.5% decline last year due to adverse weather conditions).
Meanwhile, Growing of Cereal and Growing of Vegetables recorded a growth of 19.2% and 9.6% respectively during the period. In the meantime, Growing of Tea and Growing of Rubber reported substantial declines of 7.1% and 11.9% respectively. Services activities which account for ~60.5% of overall GDP was driving by Telecommunication, Financial Service Activities, and Insurance, Reinsurance & Pension Fund grew at 4.8% Q218.
The Industrial sector grew marginally in Q218 (2.3% Y-o-Y growth cf. 5.6% Y-o-Y in Q217) as growth in Construction, Manufacture of Food, Beverages & Tobacco and Manufacture of Coke & Refined Petroleum Products was offset by contractions in Mining and Quarrying and Manufacture of Rubber & Plastic Products.
The CBSL projects GDP growth to recover 4.0% - 4.5% in 2018 on the back of recovery in Agricultural sector and continued positive momentum in Services and Industrial sectors.

A global phenomenon
Sri Lanka and other emerging economies have been adversely affected by the appreciation of the US Dollar against other currencies. Apart from the Sri Lanka Rupee, the euro has depreciated by 1.3 percent, Sterling Pound by 1.3 percent, Australian Dollar by 6.5 percent, Indonesian Rupiah by 6.8 percent, Korean Won by 4.5 percent, Chinese Yuan by 5 percent, Philippine Peso by 7.5 percent, the Singaporean Dollar and Malaysian Ringgit by 1.6 percent and the Indian rupee by 15 percent.
This has galvanized Governments to take urgent action to prop up their economies. It is in this context that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe detailed the Governments plans to tide over the crisis, which is expected to be temporary. Speaking at a school function in Nattandiya, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the Government was taking measures to protect the economy in the face of the currency depreciation. This is a world economic crisis. We will bravely face it without abandoning or running away from it, the Prime Minister said.
Currency devaluation is especially hard for countries such as Sri Lanka where the imports exceed exports. In simpler terms, when the Dollar gets stronger, we have to use more funds to import goods. And imported goods cost more for the consumer to purchase in terms of rupees. Conversely, even though we get more rupees for our exports (and tourism) as a result of the devaluation, this is still not adequate to fill the gap. The situation has been aggravated by the fact that US$ 4,000 million has to be secured by next year for debt servicing mainly of the massive loans obtained by the previous administration.
The Opposition has been quick to blame the bad economic management of the Yahapalanaya Government for the crisis without considering the global macroeconomic fundamentals underlining the situation. However, when former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, a vocal critic of the rupee depreciation, was asked by reporters for his solution to the problem, he or any of his economic pundits failed to give a cohesive answer.
The currency depreciation is the result of a combination of unfavourable factors for which there are no simple solutions. As the Prime Minister explained, the US Federal Reserves steady hike in interest rates has made investments in US treasuries more attractive, thus resulting in funds moving out of emerging markets. As a result, there was a rush among investors in other countries to invest in the US share market and other US enterprises. More than US$ 443 million had been withdrawn from the local market including the share market. When dollar reserves decrease, currencies depreciate.
The fall in the rupee can be attributed to a number of other global factors. The rising crude oil price is one factor. US sanctions on Iranian oil exports and a drop in Venezuelas production have hit net oil importers such as Sri Lanka. A costlier oil import bill has further pressured the Rupee. The trade disputes between US and China as well as several other countries had also impacted emerging economies harshly. Moreover, the demand for foreign currency goes up for goods and services, travel abroad, foreign education, overseas investments, medical treatment abroad  all these factors put further downward pressure on the Rupee.
There is no one cure to contain or reverse the downfall of the Rupee, but there are a few alternatives. Increasing local production and import substitution is a start. President Maithripala Sirisena has already said that steps should be taken to stop imports of fruits and vegetables that are grown locally. This is a step in the right direction.
Likewise, the Government should study import patterns and curb any non-essential imports at least on a temporary basis. With vehicles being one of the most high-cost imports, the Government has rightly imposed a few restrictions such as a 100 percent LC margin. This will not have an immediate impact as there are at least 20,000 vehicles already in showrooms awaiting customers.
We feel that electric vehicles should be exempted from this requirement, because they have the potential to reduce fuel consumption. The installation of solar electric vehicle chargers should be encouraged, lest the owners use the thermal-powered national grid, which negates the very purpose of having an electric car. In fact, the Government should encourage private investors to install more solar and wind power stations to reduce our dependence on fossil fuels.
The dairy industry is another area where we seem to be on the winning track. The country spends billions of dollars on milk powder imports, which can altogether be stopped if local milk production is drastically increased. A few local and foreign manufacturers already engage in fresh milk and powdered milk production locally, a trend that should be encouraged.
We need more foreign investments in a variety of fields including education, energy, manufacture of goods and infrastructure. For example, private universities will be able to attract foreign students who pay their fees in Dollars. Living in a global village, it is inevitable that we are affected by any worldwide economic upheaval, but creating a stronger domestic economy will help us face it successfully.

Going underground
Salina Turda, located in Turda, Romania, is home to an underground theme park thats nestled inside one of the oldest salt mines in the world.
The salt mine, which dates as far back as the 17th century, was used for everything from a cheese storage center to a bomb shelter in WWII after excavations stopped in 1932. Today, it has been transformed into an incredible underground theme park.
When you visit, youll head down about 400-feet before reaching the submerged wonderland. Once inside, youll find an amphitheater, a bowling alley, an underground lake with paddle and row boats, and even a Ferris wheel. Youll also find a mini golf course and ping pong courts. Its easy to get distracted by the stunning rugged caverns, the result of mining that carved out over three billion tons of salt.
Salina Turda is open year-round. Costs vary based on your preferred package, but will typically be around 15 lei (about $4) for adults.

Gota, ineligible to contest next  Presidential election - Welgama
Joint Opposition MP Kumar Welgama on Saturday said there was no point in talking about former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election as he was a US citizen and therefore ineligible to contest.
He was responding to a question from a journalist following a public event in Kalutara.
When questioned about the possibility of a member of the former President, Kurunegala district MP Mahinda Rajapaksas family becoming a candidate at the next Presidential election, Welgama reiterated that he was against a family centred rule.
Kalutara district MP Welgama during a public event last week said former President Rajapaksa should not talk about fielding a member of his own family as the next Presidential hopeful.
He said family bandyism is not suitable for the country and former President Rajapaksa faced defeat at the last presidential election due to this family centred rule.
Welgama considered a close confidante of the ex-President said if a Rajapaksa is going to contest the next polls it should be Mahinda and no one else.
The parliamentarian also said he believed there were no impediments against the former President from contesting the next presidential election.
When he was questioned with regard to allegations that the JO was linked to a conspiracy over alleged plot to assassinate President Maithripala Sirisena and Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, he responded that the JO has no such killers but there were such people during their government.

Global economic crisis:
GOVT. TO CURTAIL IMPORTS - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday said that the government will have to slash imports by US$ 500 million to US$ 1 billion by imposing duties on some sectors because of current economic constraints due to strengthening of the US dollar.
He added that industrial production in the US has increased causing rapid development.
The relief measures granted to US citizens by President Donald Trump had enabled them to purchase more goods and increased the profits of US companies.
Interest rates in the United States have been increased lately. This has encouraged the investors to pump more funds into that county, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister added that those who invested in the Sri Lankan Stock Exchange had also pulled out US$ 400 million.
It is obvious that any businessman will invest in markets where the returns are high, he said
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of D.S.Senanayake housing project in Hambantota yesterday. He asked former President Mahinda Rajapaska who was also Finance Minister as to why the rupee had depreciated against dollar from Rs.113.90 to Rs.132.55 within four months when there was no global economic crisis as such.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar had been caused due to the previous governments short sighted policy of securing commercial loans running into billions at higher interest rates. Premier Wickremesinghe added that the prices of petroleum products are soaring in the global market due to US sanctions on Oil imports from Iran and Russia adding that Sri Lanka is concerned on two simultaneous issues-the depreciation of the rupee against the dollar and soaring prices of petroleum products in the global market.
This has affected other countries, the Euro, Malaysian Ringgit, Philippines Peso, Indian Rupee and our rupee had gone down in value. Some countries have increased their interest rates.
He said that our importers have to spend more dollars to purchase goods from foreign countries and our exporters wont bring money to the country at this moment and woould wait till the right time comes to make more profits.

Disrupt Asia 2018
Highlights ICTAs commitment to Industry Development in Sri Lanka
The 2018 edition of Disrupt Asia, Sri Lankas Premier Start-up Conference and Innovation Festival, was successfully concluded recently at the Trace - Expert City with the participation of a large number of individuals connected to the growing startup industry in Sri Lanka.Organized by the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), Disrupt Asia 2018 is the progression of an increased effort by the organization to broaden the start-up landscape of the country and inspire the next wave of growth.
The Innovation Festival part of Disrupt Asia 2018 was the most significant addition to this years edition of the event and showcased many technological innovations that included advanced assistive technologies, works of art and digital activations for the public to experience and interact with. This festival captured the imagination of all, especially the younger crowds, with all of them stating their excitement at the atmosphere of the festival and the wide variety of innovative items on display.
Among the thousands of participants who attended the Conference and Innovation Festival were youngsters from all parts of the island. Several elements of Disrupt Asia 2018 drew special praise from these young participants. One such group of youngsters was from the Uki - Stepping Stone to Tech Life, a full scholarship based Accelerator program for Coding in Jaffna, Sri Lanka targeting students who have completed Advanced Level examinations but do not have access to university education or any other form of vocational education. The studentsdescribed how they were inspired by their interactions with other entrepreneurs and startup companies, established potentially long-term connections with numerous tech personalities and even picked up skills such as public speaking, pitching and presentations.
Students from Dr. Kulasinghe Maha Vidyalaya in Kotugoda who participated at the exhibition stated that they were enthralled by their experience at the Innovation Festival as they were keen in learning more about ICT and felt privileged to be given an opportunity to witness the various games displayed in the Creative Pavilion. The Creative Pavilion of the Festival helped boost the local game development community by providing a platform for Sri Lankan game developers from across the island to showcase several locally-developed games. Some of them included the Koombiyo by Kodex, Extraction Valley by RAM Studios, Zombie Rage by Motion Miracles and Ceylon Driver by RFactory.
Disrupt Asia is just one of several programs that the ICTA has commenced over the years in order to encourage collaboration and continuity among the startup landscape of Sri Lanka. The ICTAs flagship program Spiralation, a Tech Startup Support Program which focuses on supporting new technology ventures, has been successfully running since 2010. The program has supported 56 companies during this period through funding and other benefits including mentoring, capacity development training as well as global and local exposure. Similarly, ImagineIF is an initiative of ICTA which aims to initialize and develop the entrepreneurial mindset in universities and higher education institutes in Sri Lanka. In 2018, the program will be hosted in six national universities with an open invitation to all other national universities and higher education institutes to take part in.
Commenting on the impact of these Industry Developmentinitiatives, Ahamed Nishadh  Project Manager of ICTA stated, Disrupt Asia is a program that is constantly expanding and plays an important role in setting up a road map for start-ups to plan their journey towards success. With the help of the ICTA and our various other Industry Developmentinitiatives -such as Spiralation and ImagineIF - that engage with all stakeholders, the start-up ecosystem in Sri Lanka now has a clear vision and focuses on action that will generate long-term results. This is exactly what is required to take Sri Lankas start-up ecosystem forward to compete in the regional and global stage.
Disrupt Asia 2018 was supported by the Ministry of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment. The Conference part of Disrupt Asia 2018 brought to light the need for policy and strategy while entrepreneurs shared their insights, successes and failures and inspired current and potential entrepreneurs. Several top experts from USA, Netherlands, UK, Singapore, Bangladesh, Philippines, India and Sri Lanka expressed their views on Artificial Intelligence, digital marketing, security and set the stage for disruptive thinking around STEAM education, creative industries and social entrepreneurship.

Im a scapegoat says sacked  Sri Lanka captain Mathews
Sri Lankas sacked skipper Angelo Mathews accused the countrys cricket board Monday of blaming him solely for the islands humiliating exit from the Asia Cup.
The 31-year-old all rounder has threatened to retire from the two shorter formats of the game after being dumped on Sunday as captain of Sri Lankas one-day international and twenty20 teams.
I have been made the scapegoat in this entire saga of Sri Lankas dismal performance against Bangladesh and Afghanistan in the Asia Cup, Mathews said in a letter to Sri Lanka Cricket.
The board said it asked Mathews to step down and allow Dinesh Chandimal to lead Sri Lanka during Englands tour which begins next month.
The national selectors... have requested Mathews to relinquish his duties as captain with immediate effect, the board said in a statement. It did not elaborate on why Mathews was sacked.
But it follows Sri Lankas drubbing in the Asia Cup, with losses to lower-ranked Afghanistan and Bangladesh ensuring the island nations quick exit from the competition.
Sri Lanka were thumped by 137 runs against Bangladesh in their opening match of the tournament, and have now lost 30 of their 40 matches since January 2017.
Chandimal, who was already captain of Sri Lankas Test side, now takes the reins in all three formats of the game.
Sri Lanka will face England in five one-day internationals, one twenty20 and three Test matches from October 10.

India continue unbeaten run in Asia Cup
DUBAI, Sunday: Centuries by skipper Rohit Sharma and Shikhar Dhawan saw India give Pakistan a right royal drubbing cruising to a thumping nine wicket victory in their Asia Cup Super Four match played at the Dubai International Cricket Stadium on Sunday.
The pair shared a record double century partnership of 210 to make a mockery out of Pakistans total of 237-7 as India cruised past the target with 63 balls to spare.
It was Indias second win in the Super Four and makes them firm favourites to reach Fridays final with a match against Afghanistan at Dubai on Tuesday (today).
Afghanistan have no chance of reaching the final after they lost a close match by three runs to Bangladesh to suffer their second defeat in the Super Four.
Sharma and Dhawan paid scant respect to Pakistans formidable bowling line up on a flat track to knock off the required 238 runs.
Pakistan were made to pay dearly for the folly of dropping Sharma as early as the sixth over at 14 when Imam ul Haq spilt a sitter at cover and at 81 when Fakhar Zaman put down another easy chance at mid wicket. The Indian captain capitalised on these lapses to score hsi 19th ODI century and while doing so also crossed the 7000 run-mark in ODIs.
Dhawan who picked up the Man of the Match award punished the Pakistani bowlers at will hammering 16 fours and two sixes in reaching his 15th ODI hundred. He was unfortunately run out for 114 scored off 100 balls with India requiring 28 for victory.
Sharma joined by Ambati Rayudu who turned 33 on Sunday saw India home to maintain their unbeaten record in the tournament.
Earlier Shoaib Malik once again displayed his value to the team at the age of 37 when he hit a flawless 78 off 90 balls (4 fours, 2 sixes) to take Pakistan to a total of 237-7.
Winning the toss and batting first Pakistan were poised to get towards a total of around 270-280, but some excellent bowling at the death by India especially Jasprit Bumrah saw them score only 26 runs off the last five overs. It left Pakistan bowlers with the tough task of trying to contain the strong Indian batting line up.
Malik proved a thorn in the oppositions side when he defied his age to play another classy innings in hot conditions hitting fours fours and two sixes.
Yuzvendra Chahal struck in his first over by breaking the opening partnership  trapping Imam ul Haq lbw for 10, a review that India won after the appeal was over turned by the umpire.
Kuldeep Yadavs introduction in the 11th over brought the downfall of Fakhar Zaman who has so far had a rather lean tournament with the bat with scores of 24, 0 and 0. He looked in good nick to get over that period when he hit a six and a four in his innings of 31 off 44 balls but got out in the most unusual manner  losing his balance on a sweep and being declared out lbw.
Pakistan lost the in-form Babar Azam needlessly when skipper Sarfraz Ahmed misjudged a run and left his partner high and dry to be run out for 9.
Sarfraz and Malik set about repairing the innings carrying the score from 59-3 to 165-4 being involved in a 107-run stand off 138 balls that was ended when Sarfraz (44) hit a tame catch to his vis-a-vis Rohit Sharma at cover when he failed to clear in the infield.
The Indian bowlers in particular were tight in their lines and lengths and hardly made run scoring easy for the Pakistanis.
The Indian ground was also brilliant making Pakistan work hard for every run. They moved around the field like a well oiled machine reminiscent of Sri Lankas fielding when they won the World Cup in 1996.
Pakistan decided to turn on the heat when the 42nd over bowled by Kumar produced 21 runs that included two sixes hit by Asif Ali who decided to take the fight to the bowlers, but India came back strongly when they picked up Maliks wicket at a crucial stage of the game when he was caught down the leg side off Bumrah.
After Chahal had sent back Asif Ali bowled for 30, Bumrah picked up Shadab Khans wicket for 10 as India snuffed out any late attempt for a late surge by Pakistan with some excellent death bowling.

India Women take winning lead in T20I series
India romped home to a seven-wicket victory over Sri Lanka Women in the fourth T20I played at the Colombo Cricket Club ground yesterday.
India Women sealed the five-match T20I series against Sri Lanka with this win taking an unassailable 3-0 lead with one match to play. The second match of the series was washed out by rain.
Sri Lanka were off to a brisk start as opener Yasoda Mendis smashes two fours in the first over, but off-spinner Anuja Patil struck twice to remove Mendis and number three Hasini Perera in quick succession.
Apart from a 32-ball knock for 40 from experienced all rounder Shashikala Siriwardene and 31 off 26 balls from skipper Chamari Atapattu the rest of the Lankan Women could not put up any worthwhile contribution as they were restricted to a total of 134-7 in 7 overs in the rain restricted match.
India chased down the target in 15.4 overs losing three wickets. An unbroken 96-run fourth wicket stand between eighteen-year-old Jemimah Rodrigues who made her second consecutive half-century (52 not out in 37 balls, 5 fours, 2 sixes) and Anuja Patil (54 not out in 42 balls, 7 fours) saw India home comfortably.
Pacer Oshadi Ranasinghe dismissed both the Indian openers Smriti Mandhana and Mithali Raj in her first over and also picked up the wicket of Taniya Bhatia but India recovered through their fourth wicket pair.
The last T20I of the five match series will be played on Tuesday at Katunayake.
Scores:
Sri Lanka Women 134-5 in 17 overs (Shashikala Siriwardene 40; Chamari Atapattu 31, Anuja Patil 3/36)
India Women 137-3 in 15.4 overs (Jemimah Rodrigues 52 n.o., Anuja Patil 54 n.o.; Oshadi Ranasinghe 3/33)

Inflation, Dips to 2.5%
Headline Inflation, as measured by the change in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100), which is compiled by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), decreased to 2.5 per cent in August 2018 from 3.4 per cent in July 2018, on year-on-year basis, mainly driven by monthly decline in food prices in August 2018. The change in the NCPI measured on an annual average basis decreased from 5.1 per cent in July 2018 to 4.7 per cent in August 2018.
When the monthly change is considered, the NCPI decreased from 126.6 index points in July 2018 to 125.4 index points in August 2018 largely due to decline in prices of the items in the food category, particularly that of vegetables, coconuts, green chillies and fresh fish.
Meanwhile, price increases were observed in the sub-categories in the non-food category, particularly that of petrol, diesel and taxi in the transport sub-category; some items in the housing, water, Electricity, gas and other fuels; furnishing, household equipment and household maintenance; and alcoholic beverages and tobacco. The NCPI Core inflation, which reflects the underlying inflation in the economy, increased to 2.7 per cent in August 2018 from 2.3 per cent in July 2018 on year-on-year basis. Meanwhile, annual average NCPI Core inflation declined to 2.5 per cent in August 2018 from 2.7 per cent in July 2018

Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy soon - Malik
The government will bringing out the Innovation and Entrepreneurship Strategy soon to foster a climate for new high-tech products and services to emerge and also for startups to thrive, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Minister Malik Samarawickrama.
These initiatives will benefit the current exporters and will benefit emerging and aspiring exporters among our domestic enterprises. We are also supporting the universities to turn out more engineering and IT graduates, the Minister was addressing the Czech Parliamentary Delegation to Sri Lanka at the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce.
We are at the beginning of the 4th Industrial Revolution - and Sri Lanka must latch on to the opportunities that it presents and do so fast.
We are actively promoting hub operations in Sri Lanka due to our strategic location in the Bay of Bengal geographical area covering Bangladesh and the ports in the east cost of India.
Karachi, Male, Madagascar and even Myanmar also have potential focus in Sri Lanka as the connection port for the mother vessels in the Asia Europe route.
With the European Union reinstating the GSP Plus facility with effect from May 2017 EU exports have increased by 11% in the 12 months after regaining GSP. He also said that Sri Lanka is on track to achieve the target of US $17.2 billion in total exports for 2018 which is an increase of 50% over the past three years.
The Minister also said that bilateral trade between the two nations is a mere US$ 30 million per annum. Apparel accounted for 1/3rd of Sri Lankan exports to the Czechia, followed by rubber tyres.
In addition, to GSP+ we have executed the Singapore FTA earlier this year; we are in the advance stages of negotiating a FTA with China, and expanding our current FTA with India through Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA). Together the Chinese FTA and Indian ETCA will give Sri Lanka preferential access to a market of two billion people, and an emerging middle class larger than the whole of the EU.
We also noted that a few of the Czech business delegation comprised representatives from the pharmaceutical sector. This is a sector where we are actively looking to develop both for domestic supply / import substitution, and for export market. We have new industrial zones planned with the sector specifically in mind, including the requirements for high quality water and intellectual property protection.

Lanka does not have vision to win  WC 2019  Arjuna Ranatunga
Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga said that the Sri Lanka Cricket does not have a vision to win the 2019 Cricket World Cup and blamed the past and present Sports Ministers for the plight the countrys cricket has fallen to today.
I dont think winning the 2019 World Cup will be an easy task. We lost to Bangladesh and to Afghanistan and the blame should not only go to the captain, but to the selection committee as well, said Ranatunga. There was a T20 tournament held before the Asia Cup when Sri Lanka was to participate in an ODI tournament. We dont have a vision.
Ranatunga said that Sri Lanka can still train the cricketers properly and get them ready for the World Cup provided the Sri Lanka Cricket constitution is amended and elections held.
If they dont want to appoint an Interim Committee until the election, they should appoint veteran cricketers like Mahela Jayawardene, Kumar Sangakkara, Sidath Wettimuny and Muthiah Muralitharan to run cricket. The current Sports Minister (Faiszer Mustapha) should also take the responsibility, said Ranatunga, the Minister of Petroleum Resources Development at a welfare program Gamey Pansala Gamata Saviyak held at Katunayake Walana Temple yesterday.
Ranatunga also lashed out at former Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera for allowing gamblers to enter cricket and hold administrative posts.
This government has degraded cricket and Dayasiri should be responsible for that. People will call Dayasiri as Bookisiri, because of his Bookipala stories, said the former cricket captain under whose leadership Sri Lanka won the World Cup in 1996.
Responding to a query to a statement made by Parliamentarian Dayasiri Jayasekara that cricket could not be upgraded as long as Ranatunga was around, Ranatunga responded: It was the Sport Minister although being a lawyer who allowed gamblers to enter cricket. Gamblers have destroyed the sport.
People know who Dayasiri is. Before the 2015 Presidential election he called the President as Hitan Hutan and that he is spineless. But he accepted the ministerial post before the President.
He defamed Susanthika Jayasinghe and Lasith Malinga. Please look into the monies that were spent during his time as Sports Minister to establish sports grounds in rural areas whether it was spent properly. Prof. G.L. Peiris and ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa know Dayasiri better than me, Ranatunga said.

Laojee campaign wins Sumathi-Commercial of the Year Award
In the backdrop of building ethnic tension in 2017, Unilevers Laojee commercial chose to tackle the issue of race with a moving depiction of inter-racial marriage and family acceptance; turning a divisive moment in time into an opportunity for Sri Lankans to come together.
The 90 seconds film garnered tremendous response from Sri Lankans offline and online.
The video achieved one million views in less than 55 hours creating history for the brand. In a time where social media was dominated by extremist viewpoints, the Laojee commercial created for Sri Lankans a platform for healthy discussion on race and religion.
Unilevers Brand Manager Yashan Navaratnam commenting on the award, Sharing a cup of tea has always been a symbol of acceptance in Sri Lanka and for the last 20 years we have positioned Laojee as the The brew that bonds which was about people coming together.
But this time around we knew the brand was ready to carry a deeper message of acceptance and tolerance. So, we went beyond the ordinary and went where no local brand had gone before by addressing a local tension point to bring a sense of unity among Sri Lankan consumers. Explaining the film execution, J. Walter Thompsons Creative Director Prageeth Maniyanagama remarked, The intensity and sensitivity of the subject matter had to be balanced with the use of a singular emotion of love that cuts across race and religion.
Everyone relates to overlooking cultural barriers when in love, this is how we chose to build relatability on the subject of race and ethnicity.
We are immensely proud in how the film was received by Sri Lankans of all races and we are inspired by the courage of our clients to push boundaries with our work and change perceptions.
Alyna Haji Omar, CEO of J. Walter Thompson shed light on the companys ambition, Sri Lanka is changing more rapidly than the projections in the media lead us to believe.
People are yearning for an alternative point of view, the popularity of social media for news and information in this country is a testament to that fact.
We have invested considerable resources in understanding this shift and we are excited to be reimagining Sri Lanka for our partner brands. The Laojee film is a march forward in the right direction.

Largest teddy bear collection
A 68-year-old woman in the US has set a new Guinness record for the worlds largest collection of teddy bears. She owns 8,026 stuffed bears.
Jackie Mileys collection first began with a bear dubbed Grandma Jackie, which she won while on vacation in 2000. She now has a house stuffed with thousands of plush bears in South Dakota, US.
I never had a teddy bear as a child - did not even know what one was until I was eight years old and saw one at the Minnesota State Fair, said Miley.
In order to nurture her growing collection, Miley started visiting stores and thrift shops around her home state. She felt that the teddy bear characters were so interesting, that she continued buying them wherever she travelled.
Once she had accumulated nearly 3,000 teddy bears, friends started asking her if she had submitted her collection to Guinness World Records for review.
Within her assortment the smallest teddy bear is just 3/4 inches tall, with the largest at nearly 8 feet, Guinness said. Grandma Jackie is now joined by thousands of teddy bears from all US states as well as 29 other countries. The collection is displayed in a tourist attraction named Teddy Bear Town, located in Hill City, South Dakota.

Lighting a spark
Spark 18 is a fantastic initiative of the Prefect body of Royal College who believe that the imagination and creativity of a student can be unleashed and their hidden potential can be unlocked if given the correct platform and opportunity. And this can be done before they are pruned by society. So by challenging themselves, they can develop these talents and harness what is within them. Spark 18 is such a platform where the students are encouraged to come up with new inventions and innovation that can be showcased at this exhibition. Along with the fullest support of the Principal, staff and parents, Spark 2018 will take place from September 25  28 at the Royal College Premises. Daily News visited Royal College to speak to all who are involved in this exciting endeavor.
Principal of Royal College, B.A. Abeyrathna, pointed out that one objective of the project is to inculcate correct attitudes in the students.
We are providing students with the necessary platform to come up with their own inventions and innovations. This is also a learning process for them because this is a good opportunity for them to get out of the classroom mentality and come up with their own ideas. We have identified a number of students who can do miracles. Some of their ideas are remarkable covering a number of areas, said Abeyrathna
The parents, old boy and teachers are also on board to help these students in their efforts. The student turnout is massive. The talent is really huge. The number of inventions and innovations are so many that it is impressive.
Thinking powers
These students are coming with their original ideas and exhibits and are using their thinking powers. We are giving them the chance to think out of the box with the knowledge that they receive in the classroom. The inventions and innovations cover many areas. The Prefects are leading from the front. As a Principal I am delighted by this project. We have received fullest support from the students at Royal with the parents also giving their fullest support. So they have to be practical and think beyond what they have been taught. The response has been very positive. Our sponsors Dialog and Microsoft, they have come forward and given their fullest cooperation. The School Development Society and Royal College Union have come together to support us. The teachers also learn something new from the boys and their ideas. This benefits everyone involved. Through this exhibition the students can develop their own solutions for the problems in society by thinking differently. Some of it is a tangible way of the learning process. prizes and certificates will be given, explained Abeyrathna.
He also pointed out that Royal College has invited almost 3000 schools, island wide to visit Royal College  Colombo District and Rural Areas.
Head Prefect Hashen Hettigoda pointed out that this is an ideal opportunity for the participants to access their powers of imagination because what happens is that they go to school and then after school they go for tuitions classes. Hettigoda stated that after a daily process like this they completely lose their powers of imagination.

Lmited space
The Sri Lanka Inventors Commission, do an annual competition (took place around two weeks ago) and mainly rural schools take part in it. The participants are represented themselves and brought out their inventions. It is not well known but it is well known in their community. So 150 young student competitors/adult competitors have been selected from there (by the Inventors Commission) and those 150 will be sent to Spark 18. So they will be showcasing their exhibits. The adults will be in their early 20s maybe, said Hettigoda.
50 schools are sending their inventions and innovations and that all 3000 schools may not be visiting but definitely many schools from the districts will be visiting.
This is an exhibition done with the blessings of the Principal of Royal College. I must say we never expected this project to be so successful. The support has been overwhelming. We will have every invention showcased even with the limited space that we have. We also have support from Sri Lanka Army, Air Force and Navy. Dialog and Microsoft have come in. We have National Lottery Board and Development Lottery is on board with us as well. Ministry of Finance and Media are coming in a big way to give some support for these children with outstanding innovations so they come be successful in the future in their own fields and do something for the country. We also have with us our bank partner HNB. Food partners are John Keells with Elephant House, said Chairman Spark Rizan Nazeer.
From Royal College alone there are 600 inventions and innovations, and then from outside there will be 200  The 150 the Inventors Commission are sending and the 50 other schools who are sending their inventions and innovations.
Prefect Coordinator Sachindra Mendis said that the idea is to introduce innovation and the concept of innovation to Sri Lanka.
We have been talking to our students which amount to almost 8500 royalists. What they came up soon after the sessions was truly amazing. They have really great ideas, and there is potential for someone to be great in the future. We contacted the forces and we found our main sponsors dialog who will be having their own pavilion inside the exhibition area. Microsoft has also come in, since this is partially related to their field as well, in ICT and electronic. They will have their own sessions going on. Plus the Tri-forces will be having their exhibition. We basically have a lot of parties who have come into show their innovations. Anyone can bring anything to the table, said Mendis.
National Project
Mendis also pointed out that national institutes will also be making their appearance. There will be 600 royalists with their inventions and innovations and Royal clubs participating with their innovations.
A simple idea or theory could be a new innovation. For example since the clubs such as drama and dancing cannot really present inventions, the drama society for example might present drama techniques and dancing might to do the same. The red -cross society are doing a project called Orange Elephant addressing the wild elephant problem. So we have invited old school principals and everyone who has been involved with the school. We are hoping that the President and Prime Minister will also visit. It has now become a National Project, pointed out Mendis.
Mendis stated that it is the ideas of the students that really provided this boost.
We have had so much support from all sides. Children are so involved in tuition classes but they do not realize their hidden abilities. It could come in so many forms like sports, and there could be other creative avenues for them. So we gave them the idea and it just took off from there, stated Mendis.
Prefect Coordinator Thanuka Pathirage, commented that this exhibition has been a lot of hard work.
We have come a really long way. It has been a team effort and we are where we are now because of the effort of everyone involved. We never thought that there would be such a positive response. We anticipate a huge crowd turnout, said Pathirage.
Prefect Coordinator Kisal Ekanayake, said that the event is all about creating that spark.
It is about creating a spark within the students. It is wonderful seeing the enthusiasm of the students and we never thought it would go this far. We have found that our students are very interested. So this is a great stepping stone for bigger events. We just want to ignite things. So that is the change we want to create.
Prefect Coordinator Mindula Suriyabandara, pointed out that most successful entrepreneurs have done things differently. They do not follow the conventional path set before them.
They thought outside of the path set before them. So we want to inspire the kids of Royal not to take the part that is considered maybe popular. They do not need to take the path that everyone else is taking. If you want to do something extraordinary and not normal, and be someone extraordinary you might need to take a different path. That is how great innovators and entrepreneurs come about. So we want to create that spark in people. It is all about aspirations, said Suriyabandara.
There will be a musical performance starting on Saturday the 29th. It will be starting at 5pm to 12am featuring Natasha Rathnayake and others with DJ Ambrose. As bands they have Infinity and others. They are trying to make the musical performance new and different, because the whole point of the exhibition is to invent and innovate. There will be some innovative stuff at the musical show.

Liyanage hat-trick highlight of first day at RBCC World Final
The more established Asian cricket powers of Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan flexed their muscles to begin their Red Bull Campus Cricket World Final campaigns, each registering commanding victories over teams from UAE, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe respectively, on the first day of competition in Colombo. All three winning teams had star performers, but also saw vital cameos from all over their batting orders, while several part-time bowlers also delivered important overs.
With each team playing five round-robin matches in this years competition though, the losing teams from day one have plenty of time to regroup and hit back over the course of the week.
The morning was lit-up by a hat-trick from local boy and Business Management School (BMS) opening bowler Janith Liyanage, who claimed stunning figures of 4 for 6 as BMS dismissed UAEs Herriot-Watt University for 91.
Liyanage had taken the first wicket of the tournament to set Herriot-Watts collapse in motion, before returning towards the end of the innings to wipe out the oppositions tail. He bowled Ram Narayan and Prateek Hiranandani off successive deliveries at the end of the third over, before having No. 11 Ihtisham Sabir caught behind with the first ball of his next. Liyanage also had the honour of hitting his teams winning runs, batting at No 5, after opener Madushan Ravichandrakumar hit a 25- ball 44 to set BMS racing towards the target.
While that match was going on at the NCC ground, middle-order batsman Umkar Khatpe was providing an MS Dhoni-esque finish to Marathwada Mitra Mandal College of Commerces (MMMC College) innings at the neighbouring SSC venue, against University of Liberal Arts Bangladesh (ULAB).
The MMMC College team, who hail from Pune, had been winless in the 2017 World Final, but could not have made a stronger statement to kick off this years campaign, as they rode on Khatpes 30-ball 61 not out to an imposing 181 for 6, before their bowlers - led by Rohan Dhamle - stymied ULABs chase, and secured a 26-run victory.
Khatpe had come to the crease with MMMC College stuttering in the middle overs, at 61 for 3, but after initially batting unambitiously in order to get the measure of the pitch and the opposition attack, he unleashed in the last four overs, hitting seven fours and three sixes in all. The final over of the innings was especially fruitful for Khatpe, as he hit three fours and two sixes off the seam bowling of Shariful Islam, as MMMC College plundered 26 from that over.
The afternoon match at SSC was memorable for perhaps the best batting partnership of the day, as Karachi Universitys opener Abdur Rahman and No. 3 batsman Arsalan Farzand put on 72 runs together, using up only 45 balls, against Zimbabwes National University of Science and Technology (NUST). That stand formed the backbone of Karachis 183 for 5, which was the highest total of the day, and set up a rollicking 92-run victory. The NUST side lost early wickets, and were unable to break free, as the Karachi bowlers delivered tight and incisive early spells. They found their chase derailed at 6 for 56 in the 12th over, and were eventually 91 all out.
Day two sees the team from Sri Lanka take on India in the morning game - a mouthwatering clash that could help establish who the early favourite for the title may be. Bangladesh also plays Zimbabwe and Pakistan take on the UAE.

MALDIVES ELECTION: The People have spoken, says Ibrahim Mohamed Solih
THE MALDIVES: The will of the people has spoken, said Maldivian Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, after his victory became evident late on Sunday, and called upon incumbent President Abdulla Yameen to ensure smooth transition of power.
For many of us it has been a difficult journey. A journey that led to a prison cell, or years in exile. Its been a journey that led to the complete politicisation and breakdown of public institutions. But its been a journey that has ended in the ballot box, because the people willed it, Solih, 54, said in Male.
The people of the Maldives want change, justice and stability, Solih said.
Following ex-President Mohamed Nasheeds decision in June to exit the presidential race, the joint Opposition led by his Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) decided to field a common candidate. The unlikely coalition  of MDP with the Jumhooree party, Adalat party, and a faction of the ruling Progressive Party of Maldives (PPM)  chose Solih to fight a political rival they all shared.
Though well known for his reform efforts, Mr. Solih, for most of his political career as a lawmaker since 1994, maintained a low-profile until he began campaigning in the run up to the Sundays polls.
The message is loud and clear, he said on Sunday. The people of the Maldives want change, justice and stability.
On Sunday, as many as 2,62,135 voters had a chance to choose between incumbent President Abdulla Yameen and Mr. Solih in a poll that came with the promise of change.
Maldivian authorities allowed only select international observers and media to visit Male on poll day, denying visas to others that the Elections Commission had earlier accredited. However, terming the poll the most perfect election in the Maldives, Ahmed Akram, Commissioner and spokesperson at the Maldives Elections Commission said that the voter turnout was likely to be 88% or more, hours before the total votes polled was declared.
The election came under close international scrutiny, which the government resisted, but for many voters, it also brought with it a promise of brighter days. - THE HINDU

Maldives Opposition Leader wins Presidential poll
COLOMBO: Opposition Leader Ibrahim Mohamed Solih won the Maldives Presidential election, results showed Monday, a surprise defeat for President Abdulla Yameen.
Results released by the Elections Commission early Monday morning showed Solih had secured 58.3 percent of the popular vote.
Meanwhile, Maldivian President Abdulla Yameen on Monday conceded defeat in elections, easing fears of a fresh political crisis in the archipelago.
The Maldivian people have decided what they want.
I have accepted the results from yesterday, Abdulla Yameen said in a televised address to the Indian Ocean nation a day after the joint opposition candidate unexpectedly triumphed.
Earlier today, I met with Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, who the Maldivian electorate has chosen to be their next president. I have congratulated him, Yameen said.
Celebrations broke out across the tropical archipelago with opposition supporters carrying yellow flags of Solihs Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and dancing on the streets.
Solih had the backing of a united opposition trying to oust Yameen but struggled for visibility with the electorate, with local media fearful of falling afoul of heavy-handed decrees and reporting restrictions. There were also no other candidates at Sundays election held with all key dissidents either in jail or exile.
Earlier in the night Solih had called on Yameen to concede defeat once the tally showed he had an unassailable lead. I call on Yameen to respect the will of the people and bring about a peaceful, smooth transfer of power, he said on television.
He also urged the incumbent to immediately release scores of political prisoners.
Yameen, who was widely tipped to retain power, had jailed or forced into exile almost all of his main rivals.
Before polls opened, police raided the campaign headquarters of the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party (MDP) and searched the building for several hours in a bid to stop what they called illegal activities. There were no arrests.
Mohamed Nasheed, the head of the MDP, said the vote would bring the country back to the democratic path.
Yameen would have no option but to concede defeat, said Nasheed, who was elected president of a newly-democratic Maldives in 2008 but currently lives in exile.
He will not have people around him who will support him to fight on and stay, he told AFP.
Many voters across the Indian Ocean archipelago said they stood in line for over five hours to cast their ballots, while expatriate Maldivians voted in neighbouring Sri Lanka and India.
The Election Commission said balloting was extended by three hours until 7:00 pm (1400 GMT) because of technical glitches suffered by tablet computers containing electoral rolls, with officials using manual systems to verify voters identities.
An election official said the deadline was also extended due to heavy voter turnout, which was later declared at 88 percent. Yameen voted minutes after polling booths opened in the capital Male, where opposition campaign efforts had been frustrated by a media crackdown and police harassment.
Some 262,000 people in the archipelago -- famed for its white beaches and blue lagoons -- were eligible to vote in an election from which independent international monitors have been barred.
Only a handful of foreign media were allowed in to cover the poll.
The Asian Network for Free Elections, a foreign monitoring group that was denied access to the Maldives, said the campaign had been heavily tilted in favour of 59-year-old Yameen.
The government has used vaguely worded laws to silence dissent and to intimidate and imprison critics, some of whom have been assaulted and even murdered, according to Human Rights Watch.

Sri Lanka congratulates Ibrahim Mohamed Solih 
The Government yesterday congratulated Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih on his victory in the Presidential polls in the Maldives and said the election reflected the Maldivian peoples commitment to uphold democracy and the rule of law.
Sri Lanka welcomes the Joint Opposition candidate Ibrahim Mohamed Solih securing victory following the election in the Maldives where the people exercised their franchise in a decisive manner to uphold their commitment to democracy and the rule of law, the Foreign Affairs Ministry said in a statement.
We commend the government and the people of the Maldives for the conduct of a successful election process that was free, fair and peaceful.
Although the Election Commission has not as yet announced the final results, we congratulate Mr. Solih on his victory and look forward to working closely with him and the people of the Maldives in pursuing the elevation of relations between the Maldives and Sri Lanka to greater heights, the Foreign Affairs Ministry statement added.

Some of the participants of the panel were members of the MDRT, which is the premier association of financial professionals. MDRT is a global, independent association of more than 66,000 of the worlds leading life insurance and financial services professionals from more than 500 companies in 72 nations and territories.
Members of the panel discussed a number of topics such as the value of MDRT, the experience and knowledge gained from MDRT meetings, one of the most important lessons of MDRT - finding balance in ones professional life, how to gain the most number of policies and advice to those aspiring to qualify for MDRT.
The final event on the agenda was the award ceremony of Insurance Month 2017. Mr. S. K. A. S. Perera of Ceylinco Life Insurance was the overall award winner, having sold the highest number of policies and achieved the most premium.
NAFLIA and the entire plethora of events organized by the IASL are some of the means by which the Sri Lankan Life Insurance industry strives to raise awareness about their trade, because when it comes to Life Insurance its better to be 10 years too early than one minute too late.

The said controversial telephone conversation recording has been handed over to the Government Analysts Department for further verification on its authenticity.
Meanwhile, commenting on the Indian who had visited his home last week, Namal Kumara said, An Indian person had come to my home last Wednesday wanting to meet me, but I did not want to meet anyone regarding this matter as I did not want to jeopardise the ongoing investigations.
Hence, I notified the Warakapola Police and the CID regarding his visit. However, this person had visited my home the next day as well and wanted to meet me. Again I notified the Warakapola police and the CID and the Police officers came and wanted to question him. Later they took him for further questioning. However, I dont know this person and have never met him before, he said.
Namal Kumara said that he had given his fullest support to the CID with regard to their investigations, adding that he had been summoned to the CID on two occasions for questioning regarding the incident.

Over 500,000  children face immediate  danger in Tripoli
Over half a million children are in immediate danger in Libya's capital Tripoli due to fighting, the United Nations children's fund UNICEF said on Monday.
Clashes that broke out between rival militias in late August had killed at least 115 people and wounded nearly 400 by Saturday night, according to Libya's health ministry.
UNICEF said Monday that over 1,200 families have been displaced in the past 48 hours alone as clashes intensified in southern Tripoli.
That brings the total number of people displaced by the recent fighting to over 25,000, half of whom are children, UNICEF said.
More children are reportedly being recruited to fight, putting them in immediate danger. At least one child was killed as a result, said Geert Cappelaere, the UN agency's Middle East and North Africa director.
UNICEF also said schools are increasingly being used to shelter displaced families, which is likely to delay the start of the academic year beyond October 3. It said residents are facing food, power and water shortages, adding that the clashes have exacerbated the plight of migrants. Hundreds of detained refugees and migrants, including children, were forced to move because of violence. AFP

## Title: RAVINDRA PUSHPAKUMARA

RAVINDRA PUSHPAKUMARA
At the last minute I was given the okay by Asanka Gurusinha to interview Ravindra Pushpakumara at the Khettarama Stadium. Although Pushpe looked like a middle weight boxer, he put me at ease with a warm smile and a soft hand shake. I found it easy to interview Pushpe who is happily married and is a father of one son and three daughters.
He started his school cricket career at St Johns Panadura where he was selected for trials by the Board of Cricket Sri Lanka to be taken to the Madras Rubber Factory (MRF) fast bowling academy run by T. Sekhar and Dennis Lillee. That was the beginning of Ravindra Pushpakumaras Rags to Riches story of how he became an excellent pace bowler for Sri Lanka. He was in the squad of 14 players who brought the 1996 ICC Cricket World Cup to our backyard under the able captaincy of Arjuna Ranatunga. Pushpe was full of praise for his World Cup winning captain, he stated that he looked into the needs of his charges all the time and he kept an eye on them and in tactics and strategy he was one step ahead of all the rest. Pushpe was humble enough to state that he did not play in that World Cup final due to Chaminda Vaas and Pramodya Wickremasinghe being better fast bowlers. He represented Sri Lanka for 10 years, and during this tenure he opened the bowling with Chaminda Vaas and he noted that he was the best fast bowler produced by Sri Lanka to date.
Pushpakumara in his early days played for Panadura Sports Club third eleven. All of a sudden he was playing in an ODI match for Panadura against the NCC, he did well and Aravinda de Silva who played for the NCC asked him to join them. The MRF honed his skills as a young tearaway pace bowler after several visits there.
He thoroughly enjoyed his visits to the MRF reminisced Pushpe. They were put through a rigorous routine: swimming, running on sea sand, gym, weight training etc and over the week ends they had matches.
One day he returned from a training stint at the MRF to Katunayake airport and he was summoned to be at the P Sara Oval at once from the airport by the Cricket Board authorities. This was to play in the Sri Lanka Board eleven against the touring English county side Yorkshire. He was only 17 then and gave an impressive bowling performance. He was in the Sri Lanka frame from then on.
He was strongly built with a pair of legs like tree trunks. He used to get tremendous pace off the wicket and Pushpes action was very much like that of the great Waqar Younis of Pakistan.
Harping back to their World Cup winning team head coach Dave Whatmore and physio Alex Kontouri, he stated also played a major part in the win.
After his playing career Pushpakumara was requested by Nishantha Ranatunga the then secretary of the Cricket Board to develop cricket in the North and East. This was just after the war and nobody had the guts to take up this assignment however Pushpe took up the challenge. His judgment was that they have been playing the game for over a 100 years, but due to the ravages of the war there system was badly dislocated. During his tenure of 6 months together with D.S. de Silva he put the house in some sort of order and arranged tournaments for different age groups including one for women. Pushpe said that the communication was not that difficult since the boys from St Patricks and St Johns understood English.
The people in the North and the East was very keen to see Arjuna Rantunga, and Pushpe made arrangements and surprisingly Arjuna came to Jaffna within 24 hours and huge crowds gathered to welcome him. Irrespective of race, religion and cast they adored Arjuna Ranatunga our World Cup winning captain.
The talk of the town now is what ails cricket in Sri Lanka after being knocked out flat by minnows Afghanistan and Bangladesh and coming home disgraced. We are all waiting for heads to roll from top to bottom. The reports suggest that the coffins are ordered and cemetery is booked and the grave yards dug.
Ravindra Pushpakumara had other views he said that our players are not mentally tuned and their mindset is wonky. He is full of praise for the Head Coach Chandika Hathurusingha and stated that Hathu is always willing to have a two way dialog with his subordinate coaches since he is still in the learning curve. Pushpe was full of praise for Jerome Jayaratne who has been there for ages.
I never wanted to discuss matters regarding the selection policy of the selectors as he is more interested in match refereeing!
In conclusion Pushpakumara advised young cricketers to give up family and friends and other hobbies and make sacrifices if one wants to reach the top.
Pushpakumara has done all that and he looked happy.
He is a good role model for young cricketers and we all wish him well.
