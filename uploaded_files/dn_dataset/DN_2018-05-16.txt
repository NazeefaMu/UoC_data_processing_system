FTAs, proposed trade agreements,  a boost for business relocation
The recently-inked comprehensive free trade agreement (FTA) with Singapore and FTA being negotiated with China together with the enhancement of the existing agreement with India and Pakistan will encourage business relocation to Sri Lanka.
This should have positive effects on rental markets, Chairman of the Condominium Developers Association of Sri Lanka, (CDASL), Pradeep Moraes has said in a recent interview.
He also said that around 10% of investors in Sri Lankas luxury residential property developments are foreigners because purchase of residential property is not as yet linked to residency privileges.
The low foreigner count is because the purchase of residential property in Sri Lanka is not linked to residency privileges, unlike several countries in the Caribbean, South-east Asia, and the Middle East, as well as certain Mediterranean countries in the EU, Moraes has said in an interview with Oxford Business Group. (OBG)
However, this is now being remedied with a proposal to grant residency visas connected to investment.
Moraes said the CDASL welcomes the governments move to offer a 10-year residential visa for the purchase of property valued at US$ 500,000 (about Rs 79 million at current rates) or more, and a five-year visa for purchase of property between US$ 300,000 and US$ 500,000.
We estimate that luxury residential property can generate US$ 750 million in FDI in the short term, he disclosed.
Asked by OBG how he sees the capital gains tax impacting the local real estate market, Moraes said: Seeing as 10% is a modest tax, the impact would be minimal. A number of other markets have much higher levels of taxation and still experience vibrant real estate growth.
The tax has been implemented in a clear and open way, the figure has been made public, and now the market can factor it in and go about its business.
Questioned whether there is enough purchasing power in Sri Lanka to support further developments in the luxury residential segment, he pointed out that according to the global real estate consultancy Knight Frank, Sri Lanka recorded the second-highest growth rate internationally in the ultra-rich community in 2016.
Over 60 to 65% of buyers of luxury residential property are Sri Lankans already living in the country, and around 25 to 30% are expatriate Sri Lankans.
In our experience, luxury condominiums continue to be purchased with over 90 per cent equity and without borrowing.
Over 90% of such developments are in the relatively affluent Western Province, predominantly in Colombo.
Additionally, 99% of luxury and ultra-luxury apartments in completed projects and around 51% of those under construction have been sold, according to investment Management Company JLL, with over 60% of both sold to resident Sri Lankans.
Most of the larger projects have been undertaken by reputable international developers who do not borrow locally and have certainly done their due diligence.
He added that an inequitable distribution of wealth combined with the previously relaxed tax regime, had led to a gross underassessment of wealth, some of which was sent overseas. Luxury real estate offers a desirable and commercially sound option for attracting these funds into the local economy. There is certainly enough purchasing power to justify further luxury developments. Moraes reasoned.
Asked how the market has reacted to calls to restrict lending to the real estate sector, he noted that the Central Bank of Sri Lanka has engaged with all stakeholders and is satisfied that the real estate industry is not a cause for concern.
It has broadcast this view, going on, in fact, to say that the luxury segment was the least vulnerable. As with markets everywhere, mind-set and speculative concern can and will affect performance, as was seen in Colombo with the six-month slowdown in sales in 2017. Thankfully, this has now corrected, and sales are proceeding satisfactorily once again.
On the subject of the impact of real estate investment trusts (REITs) on the Sri Lankan market, he expressed the view that REITs would have a phenomenal impact on both the industry and the economy as a whole.
Investments could increase exponentially, as REITs facilitate the entry of small local investors who otherwise lack the means to purchase as individuals.
They also reassure foreign investors that their purchases benefit from professional guidance and market knowledge, Moraes said. He said the stumbling block to the implementation of REITs is the issue of the 4% stamp duty payable to the provincial councils. REITs by their very nature propagate multiple transactions and it was feared that the business model could not sustain repetitive taxation. However, evaluation undertaken by industry players, the Colombo Stock Exchange and the Securities and Exchange Commission points to the aggregate of capital gains and rentals providing a cumulative return that remains attractive, he revealed.

50 Greatest Players in World Cup History
# 44 Ronaldinho
Its the year 2002.
A young mans taken the no.11 shirt for Brazil and made it his own. No one really knew what quite to expect of him for he was just 22 - old enough to have an army of Twitter followers and reams of digital newsprint demanding he be played every day in todays world, young and unknown back then - and had just been transferred out from his hometown club Gremio to PSG.
Its World Cup Year.
The astute footballer observer, and that species of beings really had to work to keep up his hobby back in the day, knew about him, of course. Hed been brilliant in the 1997 World Youth Cup and even better in the 1999 Confederations Cup (top-scoring there).
Hed made his place permanent when Rivaldo had suffered an injury during the World Cupqualification campaign and even the return of the great man had not disrupted the starting berth of the playmaker who was slowly coming into his own in the senior side.
Its the Quarterfinals. Its David Seaman in goal. Ready to bat away the freekick that hes sure will get lumped into the mixer.
His name was Ronaldo, but the back of his shirt didnt say that. That honour went to the man in the no.9, the Original, O Fenomeno. The Brazilians being who they are, added a little, an inho, to his name, put it on the back of his shirt... and it stuck.
Hed ripped through the World Cup, combining brilliantly with Ronaldo and Rivaldo up top, the three Rs reminding the world why Brazil were Braaaasil, the most loved sporting entity on the planet and he was at the heart of it all - their playmaker in chief.
Hed scored twice already and created numerous chances along the way, and hed been tormenting the English all afternoon in the baking heat of Shizuoka. Nutmegging them. Doing little rainbow flicks. Dribbling at them.
Hed set up Brazils equaliser with one of those bendy-legged, tango-hipped, head-shaking runs of his, and when Paul Scholes put in one of those impeccably timed tackles of his on future Manchester United teammate Kleberson in one of those harmless areas to give a foul away in - a good forty yards away from goal, somewhere near the touchline - he stood over it.
England kept a high line, confident in the aerial superiority that having Rio Ferdinand and Sol Campbell in your side naturally brings with it. David Seaman, naturally then, stood a few metres off his line.
He shouldnt have.
While the whole of England slammed the flukey b***ard for that slice of luck and the English commentators on TV announced it with a sense of stunned disbelief that mirrored their populations general sentiments, the rest of the world cried Ronaldinhoooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
I knew David Seaman came off his line quite a lot, and I knew if I put the ball where I did that it could cause him problems. So I meant it. It was not luck. he would say years later - and having seen him perform at his absolute peak, who are we to disagree Of course, he bloody meant it.
A red card for a silly foul later would mean he missed the semifinal, but he was back to his string-pulling best in the final against Germany.
That freekick - the skill required to imagine it, the audacity required to pull it off - would define Brazils fifth World Cup win almost as much as the story of Ronaldos redemption. Ronaldinhos joy was important in helping define the World Cup success for Brazil.
In 2006, hed have a nightmare - the much-hyped magic Joga Bonita quartet of Dinho, Ronaldo, Adriano and Kaka failing miserably - and while he was still kicking a ball around professionally in 2010 and 2014, hed started enjoying his life way too much to bother with the nitty-gritty of staying fit and training every day. Neither Dunga nor his ol mate Scolari deemed him good enough to make the squad.
His later year disappointments dont quite matter, though.
For the magic in 2002, for the dribbles, the goals, the assists, and that freekick, for the joy, the laughs and the smiles... for introducing (re-introducing) the world to the concept that you are allowed to be happy while doing what you love for a living... Ronaldinho deserves a place in our list of 50 Greatest Players in World Cup History.  sk

Agriculture Sector Modernization Project to boost rural sector - PM
The government has initiated the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project which would develop the rural sector and modernise the countrys economy as a whole. The World Bank has granted USD 102 million for this purpose,Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister made this observation at the agreement signing ceremony of the Agriculture Sector Modernization Project where 39 local entrepreneurs who were qualified to receive the matching grant scheme of the Value Chain Development Programme entered into agreements with the World Bank. The event was held at the Waters Edge in Battaramulla.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said this was just the beginning and their support would be extended to the development, manufacturing, service, agriculture and fisheries sectors etc.
He said that the rural economy has suffered a decline due to the fact that the youth have deviated from the agriculture sector.
The Premier also said that the agriculture sector has been modernised.
For example, the United States, China, Thailand and Malaysia have modernised their agriculture sectors, the Premier said.
Hence, they had increased the harvest, reduced the cost while adding value,the Prime Minister said.
He also said the government is taking measures to develop the rural sector in order to strengthen the economy as a whole.
As a result, the exports have increased together with foreign investment, Premier Wickremesinghe said.
The country recorded its highest exports and foreign investment to the private sector in 2017, the Prime Minister said.
He added that the country has to pay USD 2,500 million annually for the loans that were obtained by the previous regime. The Prime Minister also said that although the revenue of the country was not sufficiet to settle the loans when the Good Governance government came to power, it has been able to pay the loans and utilise money for the countrys development.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said that if the rural sector is not developed, the youth would leave the village and come to the City for better prospects.
The Government plans to allocate a plot of land to the youth who are deprived of lands, the Premier said. The youth would then have the land as well as an income, he said.
Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage also spoke on the occasion.
Minister Gayantha Karunathilake, Deputy Minister Anoma Gamage, World Bank Country Director Ms Idah Pswarayi-Riddihough, World Bank Program Leader and Task Leader Andrew D.Goodland were also present on the occasion.

Alcohol, tobacco usage reduced in 2017 - ADIC
The Alcohol and Drug Information Centre (ADIC) in its 2017 trend survey on tobacco smoking and alcohol has stated that there was a significant reduction in the use of alcohol and tobacco products in 2017.
Survey results showed that alcohol users reduced from 32.9 percent in 2016 to 25.3 percent in 2017, increasing the number of non-users to 74.6 percent that year.
There was. however, an increase in alcohol use between the age groups of 15-18 in 2017 when compared to 2016, whilst the age groups 25-39 and over 40 showed a decline.
Overall, there was no significant change in the type of alcohol used between 2016 and 2017. The 2017 Budget had proposed a pricing formula to encourage people to switch to soft liquor from hard liquor.
Further. in 2017 more people, specifically 56.7 percent, stated that they started drinking between the ages of 16-20 than in 2016 which was at 53.8 percent.
When it came to tobacco usage, there was a significant decline in the number of users, from 31.9 percent in 2016 to 22.5 percent in 2017.
The highest decrease was noted in the age categories between 25-39 years, where consumption of tobacco decreased from 38.4 percent to 23.9 percent.
In general, however, 2017 saw a significant decline in alcohol and tobacco use. The ADIC stated that this was a result of maintaining government policies favourable to the control of alcohol and tobacco use.
Policies such as making pictorial warnings taking up over 80 percent of the package and the increase in the price of cigarettes have successfully reduced the smokers. This year, Cabinet approval was granted to introduce plain packaging for cigarettes. The ADIC has been conducting the survey nationally since 1998.

WAYAMBA ENVIRONMENTAL REPORTS QUESTIONABLE
Authority to inspect Norochcholai coal plant
A team led by Central Environmental Authority (CEA) Director General Hemantha Jayasinghe will make an inspection tour at the Norochcholai Coal Power Plant in the wake of rising complaints over the environmental pollution caused by it. CEA DG Jayasinghe said it was highly questionable how the Wayamba Provincial Environmental Authority had granted permission for certain industries to operate. We have got a number of complaints over industries operating in Wayamba Province and when studying their environmental reports, it is problematic as to how those were cleared by the Authority. The Norochcholai plant also comes under its purview, but I have decided to intervene, given the recent backlash. We will check as to how far the long and short term recommendations given to minimise pollution had been attended to, he said.
CEA Environmental Pollution Control Unit Director Dr. Sanjaya Rathnayaka said necessary instructions would be given during the inspection tour and if those were not adhered legal action would be taken against the plant.
NWP Environmental Authority acting Director Saman Lenaduwa confirmed that the Norochcholai plant has been operating without a valid EPL, adding that it would not be renewed till the Supreme Court case is concluded.
A fundamental rights petition filed by Environmental Foundation (Guarantee) Limited is being heard in the Supreme Court. An agreement on measures to address the environmental concerns at Norochcholai Plant was signed recently on the advice of the SC. A number of long and short term measures are being implemented as per the agreement. There were claims that the plant may also affect Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. We do not completely brush those claims aside, but we also see a separate agenda behind such claims, he said. He said NWP Environmental Authority collected samples of what was claimed to be a belt of fly ash in the sea. The samples were sent to the ITI. The test report is yet come, he said.
Centre for Human Rights and Research and Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Keerthi Thennakoon, writing to the CEA on Monday requested them to hold a proper investigation into complaints against the coal plant and take prompt action to control environmental damage.
In his letter to the CEA Chairman Chandraratne Pallegama, Thennakoon said the Norochcholai plant had been operating without a valid Environmental Protection Licence (EPL) since May 30 last year. He further charged that all four treatment plants of the coal plant have become non-operational and therefore its wastewater is discharged to the sea without treatment.
The Centre for Human Rights and Research made these allegations following two field visits on May 7 and 14. As per the environmental law, no industry is allowed to engage in production without a valid EPL. It is shocking how a power plant is allowed to be operated in this manner releasing fly ash and heavy metals to the environment, Thennakoon said.
He said the North Western Provincial Environmental Authority had constantly ignored the environmental pollution caused by the plant.

Bancroft cleared to play club cricket
Perth, Tuesday: Cameron Bancroft has been cleared to play club cricket in Western Australia while serving his ban for ball-tampering in South Africa, as he looks for redemption over a scandal that tarnished his name.
The 25-year-old opening batsman was suspended for nine months from state and international cricket over a plot to try and alter the ball with sandpaper during the third Test in Cape Town in March.
Then captain Steve Smith and his deputy David Warner were both banned for a year. Under WA Premier Cricket rules, any Cricket Australia suspension is automatically extended to club ranks, unlike in New South Wales state where Smith and Warner are able to play while serving their bans.
At an extraordinary meeting of the 16 WA Premier Cricket clubs to discuss the issue on Monday evening, Bancroft was granted special dispensation to turn out for his club side Willetton. AFP

Bandula blames weak economic management for fuel price hike
The cause of the increase in fuel prices is due to the weakening of the governments economic management, MP Bandula Gunawardena said yesterday.
If there is no question raised about it, I will ready for an intellectual debate with any powerful person in the government, he said.
Addressing a press conference organised by the Joint Opposition Economic Research unit at the Vajirasrama Buddhist Centre in Borella, Gunawardena said, The price of a litre of kerosene during Mahinda Rajapaksas regime was Rs. 81. In 2015, it was reduced to Rs. 46. Then after Rs. 44, that price has been revised by the new increased price. After the new increase, fuel prices have gone up even more than during Mahinda Rajapakses era. At that time, the price of oil barrels in the international market was as high as US$ 100 a year. Now its average price is US$ 58. The present time cannot be compared to Mahinda Rajapaksas era. At that time, there were challenges. It is our government that has faced all these challenges.
He said if a price formula had been introduced in the Rajapaksa regime, people would not have been able to afford fuel. That is why a stock of 350 kg fertilizer was given to the farmers.

To Bolgoda from the Sky
Float planes are great, they are commonly called amphibians as they can operate both on land and on water. I have never flown in a floatplane in all my life and a few days ago I managed to clear that hurdle by flying from Katukurunda to Bolgoda in an open cock-pit amphibian with the call sign 4Romeo-Kilo-Papa-Whiskey. Its called a Challenger and is a microlite by category, what they call an experimental aircraft that comes in KIT form where one can assemble the entire aeroplane in ones backyard garage.
The machine sure was a beauty, streamlined and strong, with two long pontoons for water work. It had fabric-covered wings and a fuselage with a four-bladed prop driven by an 80 HP HKS Aviation engine. The best of it all was the BRS parachute that was stowed on top of the wing. In case the engine failed, you only had to pull a cord and the plane and occupants would make a controlled descent to reach the ground safely.
Bird ready to fly
The entire aircraft could be prepared for flight by one man and at Katukurunda it was done by the owner-pilot, Captain Kshemendra Weeratunge whom I watched doing a thorough professional job getting the bird ready to fly. (Kshemendra and I last crossed paths 25 years ago. He was my student then, learning to fly. Currently, he is a senior instructor at Sri Lankan and now it was his turn to teach me how a float plane operates.)
We started and taxied to the end of the runway. Kshimendra pulled out a little checklist and read through before we rolled out with the engine at full power for the take-off. At around 40 knots Kilo Papa Whiskey eased into the sky and I saw the houses becoming smaller as we headed towards the butter-coloured beach of Kalutara. A shallow right bank got us navigated towards Kalu Ganga and we levelled off at a thousand feet. The visibility was great, and I saw old familiar places, Kapu Ella crawling, and Upper Bolgoda so vast and asleep with the old Bandaragama Bridge spread across like an imitation necklace.
We eased our way towards Ruskin Island and then headed towards San Michelle, which acted as an outer-marker to arriving float planes. We did a descending turn to head south and commenced the final run to land in front of the Yacht Club. The approach, the power control and the change in pitch for the flare was smoothly executed by Kshemendra and the big floats greased on the water to settle the Kilo Papa Whiskey like an over-grown pelican touching down on Bolgoda Lake.
I have done my first flight on a float plane. I saw the two picturesqueBolgoda Lakes, the upper and the lower that I used to roam over in light aeroplanes in my younger days. I felt the amphibian land on water, and then take-off to fly us back to Katukurunda. Couldnt ask for more, the sky tramp in me was happy as a lark.
Whizzed underneath
The return journey we flew along the coast. Panadura, Wadduwa and the twin bridges of Kalutara whizzed underneath us bringing the float plane over Avani Hotel by the beach for a right-hand downwind to land on runway 29.
The journey was over. Fabulous is the word I need to punch to describe the experience. This is what Sri Lankan skies and lakes are all about, not omitting the mountains and the bronze-tinted beaches that border the entire island. Undoubtedly, pristine beauty at its best. Sadly, it is totally underutilized from an aviation point of view. There are no light aeroplanes flown by private pilots in our clear blue skies. The training to obtain a PPL is available in Sri Lanka but somehow private flying has not become a sought-out pastime. Someone needs to get a big pair of scissors and cut off all the red tape that clutters the path to leisure flying. I do not want to point fingers at anyone, but to put the record right I must say that as long ago as 1935, private flying was so very popular that on weekends pleasure pilots took their Tiger Moths and flew from Ratmalana to air-fields in Puttalam or Koggala and had lunch and flew back. That was the norm then. Why not now Especially when we have 15 airports spread around the country waiting for pilots to come and land.
Progress in aviation
It costs 1.5 million rupees to obtain a PPL. Can be done much cheaper if Civil Aviation Authority introduces Sports Licenses as they do in many other countries. We do have to remember that progress in aviation does not happen by having 15 operable air-fields or building new ones. It happens when you see more aeroplanes in flight, all sizes and all types. A good beginning for that would be the private pilot taking to the sky.
I have expressed this sentiment a hundred times in different forums of the aviation fraternity. We need to explore all possibilities of expanding general aviation if we are to introduce the God-given natural beauty we have in this country to be seen with a birds eye view. A coordinated effort is the need between Civil Aviation, the Airport Authority, the flying schools, the Airforce and whoever is linked to general aviation. Someone needs to take the lead and work with a vision to make more aeroplanes fly in Sri Lanka, lest we stay in the doldrums and cast away the vast opportunities that are abundant to us to showcase our clear blue sky.

Born of freshness






Arul Subramaniam in a note on FB dated June 3, 2016, says:
Dear K S Siva Anna,
This morning, when I casually went through my collection of old books, I had the opportunity to go through your book Contemporary Tamil Writing In Sri Lanka published in October 1974 (42 years back). I was amazed when I read your brief review of my first novel published in 1973. Like Dr Kailasapathy and Dr Sivathamby, you too commended that novel in a grand manner. Thank you, Anna, for giving me the chance to refresh my memories of those astonishing moments.
I give that writing for you to recollect:
Arul Subramaniams Avarkalukku Vayathu Vanthu Viddathu (They have come of age) is a splendidly written novel by a new writer. It gives excellent reading fare as a novel showing the gradual development of characters and their relationships with each other, besides it is also a progressive piece of writing on the theme of national integration.
A Tamil youth, Ariyam from Trincomalee, conditioned by the local political climate there, comes to Colombo only to realize that the Sinhala people are not bad as all that. He develops an attachment - both physical and platonic towards Monica at whose house he is boarded. He marries the girl eventually but is in a dilemma as to whether he should break the news to his parents, whom he dares to disobey. It is the struggle between conviction and commitment and the attachment and obligations to his parents that worries him. He is not irrational as to take hasty decisions. It is his slow process of both keeping his wife and winning over his conservative, hard-core parents to his side that the novel describes.
I will not be doing justice to the novel by merely telling what the novel is about. Readers themselves should read it to see in what a grand manner he has written this realistic social piece. Trincomalee has produced an outstanding writer and his first novel is a major contribution to Tamil fiction.
As Dr K. Sivathamby has written in his foreword, this book too should be translated into Sinhala for the benefit of the majority of the readers, especially to show that not all the Tamil people are cast in the same mould. Those who scorn at our local Tamil writers that their writing is merely propagandist will have to sit back and review their thoughts, as people like Arul Subramaniam are writing in such a way that structure and theme are inseparable in their creative writings.
Arul Subramaniam has the nave, unspoilt freshness in him and this helps him to write his stories without any inhibitions. This is a realistic tone. As a contemporary writer, he sees the inner realism rather than the obvious.
Rajakavi Raheels Poems
Raheel is a well-known poet and broadcaster hailing from Nintahavoor in the East of Lanka. He lives both in Lanka and Seychelles. Recently when I visited Pirai F M, a regional broadcasting station of the Sri Lanka Broadcasting Corporation, I was invited to be interviewed as a former announcer and writer/critic. Rafik another poet from Akkaraipattu and Gayum from Sainthamaruthu working for the radio station with limited facilities but presenting quality programmes were instrumental in extending the invitation to me.
Raheel was the interviewer. He gave me his own three books and two were anthologies of poems. Colourfully printed in India, these books are attractive. Tamil honours graduate from Peradeniya,, Raheel attracts attention with his short and witty poems. The book Thevathyin Anthapurathil Paddanmpoochik) kudiiyirrruppu ((The occupation of the Butterfly in the harem of the Angel)
Raheel seems to be a lover of his ideal pretty woman. All his poems are on her and her femininity All his poems are lyrics for film songs.
Let me attempt to render into English some of the lines which lovers may like.
* Poetry is a flower that blossoms after it has withered away.
* The poet is a candlestick, only when he has melted away, what remains as light is the poem.
* When you breathed in, the wind must have thanked the God.
* To look at the brightness of your teeth the stars ill come down even in daytime.
* The parrots worshipped God asking Him the colour of your skin.
* The flute is satisfied only when your name is mentioned.
* It seems that the swans last wish is to improve on your walking.
* The pride of the cuckoo birds will vanish they listen to your voice.
* Dont chase the ants that believe you are a sugarcane garden.
* Those. bees are awaiting when you would become a flower.
* When you re silent I could hearth footsteps of the ants
* If you show your nails the butterflies will look for their face on it.
* The Spider that looked at your face weaves a silk net in happiness.
* When he told me that he hasnt seen a black flower showed him your lock of hair.
* No drying or withering for the flower that you touched
* Having seen your nose stud, the poet said in a beautiful day a single star glistens.
* My seventh sense is your beauty that told me what is love
* You speak in two languages- eyes and voice.
The book in many colours is full of pictures of beautiful young women.
Rapakivi Raheel has brought out1 2 books of poems, a short story collection. He has written serialized novels for magazines. His first novel was published in 2015. He had earned appellations for his varied talents.

Pelwatte Dairy Industries Limited is offering its Pelwatte Butter tub at 10% off at Cargills outlets islandwide. The offer which began on May 1 will be in place until the May 31.
Pelwatte Dairy is a leading home-grown dairy company that produces many different dairy products such as milk powder, yoghurt, ice-cream and both home use and bulk butter for industrial use.
The brand is widely known for the natural approach taken in the production of their products.
Pelwatte butter is considered natural due to many reasons; one being that the butter is made from the fat in fresh milk with no added preservatives. Fresh milk contains about 4-5% fat and the process of butter production tends to increase the fat percentage in order to control the fat percentage, a standardization process is used which is also another reason as to why Pelwatte Butter is considered all-natural.

The case against Hambantota Mayor Eraj Fernando and four others for having intimidated five UNP MPs who were on a tour of the Hambantota Port and the Mattala Airport on April 17, 2014, was postponed to June 13, after recording evidence at the Hambantota High Court yesterday.
Hambantota High Court Judge Thamara Tennekoon was presiding over the case.
Evidence was recorded from UNP MPs Eran Wickremaratne, Ajith Mannapperuma and Nalin Bandara.
Wickremaratne informed court that if his security personnel and the media were not present, his life would have been in very serious danger.
Evidence from UNP MPs Ajith P Perera and R.Yogarajan had been recorded when the case was previously heard on March 26.
However, the court needs to further record evidence from 52 witnesses with regard to this case.
In addition, many media personnel were present when the incident took place but the evidence of only four have been recorded.
Deputy Solicitor General Dilip Peiris appeared on behalf of the Attorney Generals Department whilst Presidents Counsel U.R.de Silva appeared on behalf of the accused.
We have come here to give evidence about an attack that happened while we were on an inspection tour of the Magampura Port in 2014. People came and threatened us. After our complaint in 2014, it is in 2018 that the case has come before court. It has taken four years. If it takes four years for MPs like us, we can imagine the suffering the average man undergoes to have his case heard in court, said MP Wickremaratne, speaking to the media after the case.
MP Bandara said he hoped that justice would be served to the MPs and media personnel who suffered by the attack in 2014.

CEB denies charges of ashes spreading to Sri Maha Bodhi
Ceylon Electricity Board engineers and Norochcholai Power Plant officials refuted claims that toxic acids evaporating from the power plant posed a threat to the sacred Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi, in Anuradhapura.
It was reported that toxic fumes from the power plant which contained concentrated amounts of toxic acids and heavy metals could be swept as far away as the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi due to the onset of the oncoming Southwest monsoon.
We sent samples of these deposits to the Industrial Training Institute (ITI).
They have found that the samples contain negligible amounts of these acids, a range of 0.5 to 0.7. We use low-sulfur, low-ash, high calorie coal out of which carbon dioxide emissions are greatly reduced, the source told the Daily News.
The ITI also studied the air flow and the extent that these ashes would be swept away, they found that after a short distance, all the particles would have evaporated into thin air.
The engineer added that the notion that the ashes would be swept as far as the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi was too far-fetched and concocted by environmentalists and lobbyists who had not based their findings on facts or scientific evidence.
It was announced last week that Southwest monsoonal conditions were making it conducive for toxic fumes with concentrates of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxide and heavy metal particles to spread to a radius of 6 to 6.5 km, as far as the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi. Environmentalists observed that the effect of the condition can be observed in the discoloration of foliage in trees surrounding the vicinity of the Norochcholai Power Plant. It was also revealed that waters surrounding the plant were acidic in nature causing damage to the marine environment.

Ceylinco Life has commenced the construction of an imposing new building for the companys main branch in Jaffna.
A five-storey edifice with 20,000 square feet of purpose-designed office space will be the second branch building at Kanathiddy Road, Jaffna after 14-months of construction, the company said.
Built to the eco-friendly specifications adopted by Ceylinco Life for all new branches on company-owned land, the new building will be the nucleus of the companys operations inthe Jaffna region, currently comprising of branches at five other locations on the peninsula.
Ceylinco Life Managing Director R. Renganathan laid the foundation stone for the new building at a grand ceremony organised by the branch. Speaking at the event, he noted that Jaffna has been a consistently high-performing region for Ceylinco Life, and that the investment in a second branch building reflects the companys commitment to the region.
Designed for optimal use of natural light and entirely solar powered, the new building will be equipped with the latest energy-efficient lighting and air conditioning systems, will have a facility for rainwater harvesting and its own car park.
A plant trough on every floor enhances its eco-friendly aspect while adding to the buildings aesthetics.
Among other Ceylinco Life branch buildings designed to the companys sustainable energy model are those at Horana, Panadura, Wennappuwa, Bandarawela, Chilaw and Kadawatha.
The company also owns the buildings housing its offices in Anuradhapura, Trincolmalee, Jaffna, Batticaloa, Kandy, Kalutara, Kurunegala, Gampaha, Galle, Matara, Tissamaharama, Negombo, Ratnapura, Kotahena and Mount Lavinia, many of which have been converted to solar energy.

The Construction Leadership Forum jointly organized by National Construction Association of Sri Lanka (NCCSL), Ceylon Institute of Builders (CIOB), Major Constructors of Sri Lanka (MCSL) and Young Constructors Forum (YCF) was held recently at Hotel Cinnamon Lakeside. The forum was sponsored by Trimble Solutions.
Ruwan De Silva, Director of NCASL and Vice President of CIOB mentioned that the objectives of organizing the Construction Leadership Forum was to bring together various stake holders from the construction industry to appraise them of the new technologies that is impacting the construction industry worldwide and to discuss the issues facing our local industry with the view of identifying and developing possible strategies to address these issues.
Athula Priyantha Galagoda - Chairman NCASL delivered the welcome speech.
Eng. Harsh Pareek, Regional Director of Trimble Solutions Inc. addressed the audience on new technologies that are revolutionizing the construction industry worldwide.
He shared his perspectives on how leading international construction companies are adopting modern technologies to redefine the construction process in different areas such as design, project delivery, life cycle performance, affordability and disaster resilience.
His speech was followed by a product demonstration by Trimble Solutions where they demonstrated the automation of a building construction project using Tekla software product suite.
This was followed by a panel discussion on Construction Industry Challenges & Scope of Technology Adoption. Dr. Rohan Karunaratne, President of CIOB and Archt. H Wijewardena, President of Sri Lanka Institute of Architects served as joint chairs and Eng. Menuwan Weerasinghe, Director KDA Weerasinghe & Co. moderated the discussion.
One concern some participants had was that the cost involved in adopting new technologies is rather high for the Sri Lankan companies.
Eng. Shanika Cabraal, president of Young Constructors Forum pointed out the need for the government to allocate fund for establishing Research & Development infrastructure in the Universities and partner with the industry organizations to provide on the job training to students.
Many of the participants mentioned that there is a need for the industry to closely work with the Universities for knowledge sharing and fostering industry related research and development.

SAFETY AT PEDESTRIAN CROSSINGS AND SLEEPY DRIVERS
Accidents and loss of lives at pedestrian crossings have become the order of the day as reported on both electronic and printed media. It is high time that the concerned authorities took preventive measures without further delay.
I wish to draw the attention of the concerned authorities in the respective ministries and the Traffic Police to the following suggestion which can be implemented at the minimum cost.
A rough surface on the road should be created 50 metres before the Pedestrian Crossing, by burning/ melting and scraping the top layer of the carpet for a width of 6 feet on the on-coming side. This will alert the driver through the slight vibration of the steering wheel that there is a Pedestrian Crossing Ahead.
Creating rough surface can also be done by covering the surface of the small hand operated road roller temporarily with a metal layer with ridges and then pushing it to and fro on the burnt/melted portion of the carpet whilst sprinkling water. The ridged metal covering can be removed after finishing the work.
A massive saving can be made on the entire cost of material needed for marking the road with white zebra strip as it may have to be done a million times to cover all the roads in the country.
This can also be done, every 10 kilometres, to prevent the driver from falling asleep. These precautionary measures have been taken in some Middle East countries.
A vehicle can be replaced a billion times but not human life. This is a very simple inexpensive device but consider the number and value of human lives that can be saved daily. So, why hesitate
Over to you dear Ministers of Megapolis Transport and Highways, all accident prevention authorities including Traffic Police.

He said Thomas Howard (25), was the first to die on Sunday, shortly after visiting the Cleopatra Night Club located at the basement of the Liberty Plaza building in Colombo.
There were strong suspicions of drug deals at Cleopatra.A local travel reviewer had warned of the seedy nature of the night club located on the basement of Liberty Plaza which is owned by Colombo Lands and Development Company.
Heavily painted, fumigated with cheap perfume, and host to a steady stream of bleary men, Cleopatra is an essay in seediness, said a reviewer on the local travel site yamu.lk. Police are investigating into whether the English amateur rugby players had been served drugs at the night club amid reports that the victims may have ingested brown sugar, a variant of heroin. When Daily News contacted the Cleopatra Night Club, they were not available for comment.
Police said an autopsy on Howard revealed that he did not die due to any external injuries or any illness. An open verdict has been given by the Judicial Medical Officer, M.N. Ruhul Haq and further forensic tests have been ordered. Body parts of the deceased (Howard) had been sent to the Government Analyst for examination.
Police Spokesman Gunasekera said initial investigations showed the two victims from the Durham City Rugby Football Club, along with their team mates, had played a friendly match with the Ceylonese Rugby and Football Club on Saturday.
After the match, they had visited Cleopatra around 10.30pm and they had returned to the hotel they were staying in the Colombo Fort area at around 4.00am on Sunday in small groups at various intervals. The two players at around 10 am had complained of breathing difficulties and the hotel management had admitted them to a private hospital in Colombo. Around 12 in the afternoon one of the two players who had been admitted died.
The British High Commission in Colombo said it was supporting the families of the two victims and were in contact with local authorities. The Durham City Rugby club on its website said the Howard and Baty families have requested that their right to privacy is respected.

ComBank deposits  surpass Rs 900 bn
Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC has reported profit before VAT and NBT of Rs 7.677 billion and profit before tax of Rs 6.337 billion for the first quarter of 2018, with growth of 21.07% and 21.36% respectively signalling an exceptionally strong start to the financial year 2018.
Gross income for the three months ending 31st March 2018 was up 19.03% to Rs 32.096 billion, with interest income improving by a robust 20.59% to Rs 28.567 billion, the countrys benchmark private bank said in a filing with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE).
The Bank attributed the increase in interest income to vigorous growth in interest-earning assets in the quarter under review and higher yields on such assets. The Bank had been successful in containing growth in interest expenses to 13.12% despite a shift in its deposit mix towards high cost deposits, thereby achieving net interest income of Rs 11.568 billion, an improvement of Rs 2.907 billion or 33.55% over the corresponding quarter of 2017.
Profit after tax for the three months grew by 16.04% to Rs 4.381 billion, an increase of Rs 606 million.
Commercial Bank Chairman Dharma Dheerasinghe said the Banks performance in the period reviewed was impressive, but cautioned that prevailing conditions in the market had resulted in an increase in non-performing loans (NPLs), necessitating impairment charges of Rs 1.464 billion for both individual and collective impairments. Our gross and net NPL ratios are still well below industry averages, but we are taking every effort possible to manage this aspect, Dheerasinghe said.
The Banks Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said balance sheet growth, one of the fundamental strengths of Commercial Bank, had accelerated in the three months reviewedreflecting the continued trust and confidence reposed in the Bank as well as its substantial involvement in the economy of the country.
Total assets of the Bank grew by Rs 74.702 billion or 6.53% over the three months to Rs 1.218 trillion as at 31st March 2018. Asset growth since the end of the first quarter of 2017 totalled Rs 169.261 billion or 16.14%YoY. The Banks deposits portfolio surpassed Rs 900 billion in the quarter reviewed, growing by 6.53% or Rs 55.506 billion to Rs 905.634 billion as at 31st March 2018, reflecting average monthly growth of more than Rs 18.5 billion.In other key performance indicators, the Bank reported that total operating income improved by 26.98% to Rs 14.642 billion for the three months. The gross NPL ratio increased to 2.20% from 1.88% at the end of 2017, but reflected a marginal improvement over that of the first quarter of the preceding year. The net NPL ratio moved up from 0.92% as at 31st December 2017 to 1.24% at the end of the reviewed quarter.
Net fee & commission income grew by 15.89% to Rs 2.342 billion, facilitated by a 15.25% improvement in fee income (Rs 2.796 billion), but other income witnessed a decline of 13.68% to Rs 732.362 million mainly due to a decrease in gains from trading in the period under review.

Committee appointed to resolve big onion, potato farmers issues
A committee headed by Agriculture State Minister Wasantha Aluwihare was appointed to look into the issues faced by big onion and potato farmers to implement a special mechanism to protect them, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister stressed the importance of having a proper plan to protect the farmers. The big onion farmers in the Matale, Jaffna and Puttlam districts and the Potato farmers in Bandarawela and Nuwara Eliya are inconvenienced since they cannot sell their produce at a good price. If farmers want to sell their products, they must go to marketplace without depending on middlemen, he said. But in our country, racketeers and profiteers are taking farmers produce. The Minister said that it was important to limit or temporally suspend the importation of big onions and potatoes and increase taxes imposed on those imports during the harvest season.
The Ministry has already decided to purchase 7,000 metric tonnes of seed onion from the local farmers, Ministerial sources said.

Deadly disease at Karapitiya hospital identified
The unidentified disease at the Galle, Karapitiya Teaching hospital has been identified to be a serious strain of pneumonia with the disease fast spreading in the Southern Province, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital, Galle Paediatrician Dr.Aruna de Silva said yesterday.
When the Daily News further inquired further about the disease, he explained that in the past few months, there was some prevalence of the disease, but, the situation had become worse now.
Patients from Matara, Hambantota and Tangalle have started to come here. In addition to our own childrens ward, childrens wards at hospitals in the area are also full. The most affected are children between the ages of 2-3 years.This disease is very potent to the child, Dr.de Silva said.
When investigating the root causes of the disease, the doctors working on this agree that this is not pneumonia which comes from a virus,but, pneumonia which has come as a result of Influenza and Adenoviruses. Both adults and children are susceptible to it. It can be deadly in children below two years, Dr.de Silva added.
He said the best cure was prevention and to keep healthy children away from it. If children who have caught the disease have siblings, it is advised that they not visit the sick child in hospital. Parents in turn have been asked not to attend weddings,funerals or areas where people congregate.
If you child has a cold, cough or fever, it is best that he/she is kept at home and not sent to school. This would help safeguard healthy children and reduce the number infected, he furthr said.
If healthy people come to hospital to visit sick children,they are likely to get sick too. Therefore, we are working with the Hospital Director to control visitor numbers. We have also suggested that all staff and parents enter the area wearing masks. Arrangements have also been made to provide soap and sanitisers for people to wash after visiting patients, Dr.de Silva said.
He also believes that if the basic conditions above were followed, they would be able to contain the spread of the disease. Further, if children display symptoms of high fever, cough, diarrhoea, it has been recommended that they seek immediate medical attention.

Death of two-year-old: Homicide verdict returned; four suspects arrested
The Maligawatte Police had commenced an investigation into information received that the parents of a small boy who had died under mysterious circumstances at the flats located on Hijjra Mawatha, Colombo 10 were preparing to hold the funeral at around 5 pm yesterday.
Colombo City Coroner Iresha Deshani Samaraweera who conducted the post mortem investigations into the death returned a verdict of homicide.
She ordered the Maligawatte Police to file action against the suspects before the Magistrates Courts.
Earlier yesterday, when a group of police officers had visited the house, the parents of two-year-old Mohammed Ali Mohammed Usman Ikam, had told police that the child had died due to high blood sugar levels.
However, investigations had revealed that there was a burn wound on the left foot of the deceased child while the police had notified the Akluthkade Number 04 Court about the suspicious circumstances regarding the death of this child and the court had issued an order to conduct the post-mortem examinations.
Examinations at the Coroners Court revealed that the Ikam was adopted by the two individuals in whose house the child was found dead. In the wake of the Coroners report, the police arrested the couple who had adopted the child as well as his biological parents. They are to be produced before the Aluthkade court today (16).
Police investigations revealed that with the death of the child, the adopted parents had tried to bury him but the neighbours in the area had suspected a crime and they had immediately notified the police emergency hotline of the death. As a result the Maligawatte police had come to the home of the suspects.
Colombo Judicial Medical Officer, S.D. Wasantha Perera who conducted the post-mortem examination on the child ruled the cause of death to be a blow to his head with a blunt weapon. It was this report that he presented before the Coroners Court.
Ikam had been adopted by the suspects two years ago from a couple living in Kahawatte.
The adopted mother, Mohamed Fathima Safana (30), giving evidence before the Colombo Coroner stated that she had two other children and that she had a letter from his biological parents stating that they have given custody of the child to them.
On 11 April 2018, the child had fainted and they had taken him to a private hospital, where the doctors said that he had high blood sugar levels. They had admitted the child in hospital and later when he had vomited, she had taken him to wash his legs.
He cried out and it is then I noticed that the water was hot, she said explaining the burn injuries on the childs foot.
Thereafter on May 14 once again, the child had fainted and the couple stated that, the second time they found him dead. They had tried to get death certificates from two doctors in a private hospital but they had refused.So they tried to bury him in secret. It is then that the Police arrived in their home.
When the Coroner asked if any of them had previous cases against them, Safana said that her husband had a case lodged against him in 2013, for having assaulted his two children from a previous marriage. The two children are currently in probationary care.

Do not criticise President  Mangala
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera asked recently not to criticise President Maithripala Sirisena in public or in private even if we would be able to elect a UNPer as President in future.
The Minister was addressing the councillors elected to the Local Government Bodies from the party in the Matara district.
By agreeing to contest the 2015 Presidential Election as the common candidate, President Sirisena risked his freedom and life. He would have suffered a worse fate than Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka suffered if we lost. Therefore, do not criticise President Sirisena and put the government in jeopardy. The government has got a new lease of life as the ministers who sat in the Cabinet and pulled us back have resigned and decided to sit in the opposition, the Minister said.
I sincerely hope that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will be UNPs candidate at the next Presidential election and get elected to the post because Ranil Wickremesinghe is a patriotic leader, whose vision can take this country forward, the Minister said.
Minister Samaraweera said that when Anura Bandaranayaike revolted to oust his mother, SLFP leader Prime Minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, she had confided in him and said that she was not willing to relinquish leadership until she identified a suitable person capable of keeping the party together.
The Minister briefly explained the need for the recent fuel increase and outlined the rural development projects the government to spend the revenue on. Referring to the incident that took place in Polathumodara, Minister Samaraweera said that on principle he did not participate in opening ceremonies pf projects initiated by others.
There is an instance that a foundation stone I laid was removed and dumped in the Nilwala River on completion of the project as I had left the government by then, Samaraweera recalled.
Being members of the ruling party who have to sit in the opposition of the local government bodies except in the Weligama UC is a challenge. It is you that receive the bouquets as well as the brickbats first for any action taken by the government. Our government will help you serve your constituents and develop your wards in every way possible. You have less than 18 months more to win back the confidence of your constituents which will be the first step to forming a UNP government, Minister Samaraweera said

Egyptians use mania over soccer star Salah to sell Ramadan products
CAIRO, Tuesday: Egyptian soccer star Mohammed Salah set a scoring record this season that helped Liverpool clinch fourth place in the Premier League. Now pictures of his bearded face are boosting sales ahead of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan.
Manufacturers have plastered his image on traditional Ramadan products ranging from pillows to lanterns famous and paper cut-outs as they try to cash in on his success to offset economic hardships caused by the governments financial reforms.
The Mohamed Salah lantern is the highest selling lantern this year, said Essam, a shopkeeper, who did not give his last name. Other shopkeepers at a market in Cairos Sayeda Zainab neighbourhood said Salah mania was also helping them sell.
Salah scored 44 goals in 51 games in his debut campaign and last week won the Football Writers Association award. Next month, the 25-year-old will lead Egypts first team for 28 years at the World Cup.
Mohamed Salah is a role model for all Egyptians at the moment, said Omnia, a shopper. All of Egypt loves Mo Salah, as they call him in England.
Demand for food and traditional items soars during Ramadan, a month whose start date depends on the sighting of a crescent moon.  Agencies

England recall Buttler for first Pakistan Test
LONDON May15: England recalled batsman Jos Buttler in a 12-man squad announced Tuesday for the first Test against Pakistan at Lords on May 24.
In the first England squad since former Test batsman Ed Smith took over as national selector, Somerset off-spinner Dom Bess was given a first call-up.
But, after Englands tour series losses in Australia and New Zealand, top-order batsman James Vince was dropped after a run of low scores at Test level despite the Hampshire batsman making an unbeaten 201 against Somerset on Monday.
Buttler, widely regarded as one of the most talented English batsmen of his generation, last played Test cricket when he batted down the order. The 27-year-old has had a frustrating 18-match career in Test cricket, with his last appearance in the format against India at Chennai in December 2016.
Having made an impact at international level as a wicket-keeper/batsman, Buttler has been selected for the first of a two-Test series against Pakistan purely as a batsman.
Jonny Bairstow, who succeeded Buttler as Englands Test keeper, has retained his place behind the stumps having become a mainstay of skipper Joe Roots side with both bat and gloves.
Buttler is currently playing for the Rajasthan Royals in the Twenty20 Indian Premier League, where his last three scores have been 95, 94 and 81.
Outstanding talent
But he has not played first-class cricket for Lancashire, his English county, since the end of last season.
Jos Buttler is an outstanding talent, who is already a central part of Englands white ball teams, said Smith in an England and Wales Cricket Board statement.
The selection panel feels that this is the perfect moment to reintroduce Jos to Test cricket, where he has already enjoyed some success, including a stint playing as a specialist batsman at number seven.
Jos is playing with great confidence and flair, and he will bring unique qualities to the Test team. Bess, 20, has played just 16 first-class matches.
But he starred for MCC in the Champion County match against Essex in March where he took eight wickets in the match and scored a century in a victory over the county Champions in Barbados. An injury to Somerset team-mate Jack Leach has paved the way for Besss inclusion as the lone specialist spinner in a squad after England decided against recalling Moeen Ali.
Dom Bess has made an excellent start to his first-class career, said Smith.
With Jack Leach missing out due to injury, the selection panel wanted to invest opportunity in a young spin bowler.
Doms strong form, character and all-round abilities presented a compelling case for selection. England 12-man squad to play Pakistan in the first Test at Lords, May 24-28:

## Title: Faithful exponents of Bharatha Natyam
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, May 16, 2018 - 01:00
Faithful exponents of Bharatha Natyam
The fascination of Bharatha Natyam lies in the uniqueness of its traditional repertoire. The repertoire of Bharatha Natyam recital was laid down in the 19th century by the Tanjore Quartet, namely Chinniah, Ponniah, Sivanandam and Vadivelu. To this day, the exponents of Bharatha Natyam faithfully follow this tradition.
The Alarippu, Jetheeswaram, Sabtham, Varnam, Padams, Thillana and Slokas are the correct sequence in the practice of this art which is an artistic yoga revealing the spiritual through corporal, says Balasaraswathi the Queen of Bharatha Natyam.
Philosophical depth
Bharatha Natyam is totally based on Hinduism and Hindu philosophy. Nobody can deny this fact. Those who get involved in this art form must learn and understand the depth of the sacred Hindu philosophy. Bharatha Natyam originated in the temples as Sadir. With the passage of time, it was developed in and around the temple environs with a new dimension and vision as Bharatha Natyam which is totally a sacred dance form. Earlier it was originally practised and preserved by the temple Devadasi clan.
According to Hindu philosophy, the Hindu temple structure is based on the human body. The head is regarded as the Sanctorum (Garpagragam). The tall temple tower built over the Garpagragam is described as Vimanam which is adorned with beautiful sculptures. (This temple description starts from sanctum to the temple tower entrance).
The following area in the human body is the neck, which is called or named as Artha Mandapam where the priests stand and engage themselves in the process of ritual activities for the Garpagragam (Sanctorum).
Sacrificial pit
The chest area of the body is regarded as Maha Mandapam. The stomach area is regarded as Isathapa Mandapam. The sacrificial pit is constructed in the Isathapa Mandapam. During the period of Yaga poojas and Homapoojas sacred offerings are offered in the sacrificial pit. All the offerings mainly the Navathaniyam grains and Yagapooja offerings are poured into this constructed pit. At the end of the Isthampa Mandapam, Nanthi, Pali Pee demon the Kodi Isthampam are installed.
The thighs of the body are regarded as Sabha Mandapam of the temple. Earlier the cultural activities were supposed to be performed at the Sabha Mandapam. The knee area of the body is regarded as the first entrance of the temple.
Below the knee is regarded as Kalyana Mandapam which is also known as Utsava Mandapam where the Utsavamoorthies are decorated and kept during the Utsavams. The feet and the toes of the human body are regarded as the main entrance of the temple with majestic Kopuram. But all these traditional temple features are still found in the present Hindu temple structure to a certain extent.
Temple architecture
The Bharatha Natyam Queen of the late Balasaraswathi said that the fundamental order of a dance recital should follow the temple architecture. According to Balasaraswathi the Bharatha Natyam recital is structured like a great temple: enter through Gopuram (outer hall), the Allarippu, cross through Arthamandapam, (halfway hall) the Jetheeswaram, then the Mandapam (the great hall) Sabtham and the holy precinct of the deity is Varnam.
Therefore, those who want to learn or master this art form must know the basic Hindu link with this great dance form. If anybody tries to learn this great art without knowing the depth of it with the passage of time this sacred art would be dragged to a social level art. The link between Hinduism and Bharatha Natyam is inseparable.

Grand celebration to commemorate 1818 rebellion bicentenary
The bicentenary of the famous 1818 rebellion is to be celebrated on a grand scale.
Science Technology, Research, Skills Development, Vocational Training and Kandyan Heritage Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama has directed relevant officials to make necessary arrangements to celebrate the 200th anniversary of the 1818 rebellion, which falls this year.
He has directed that the National Archives Department, the Kandyan Heritage Unit of his Ministry and the Department of Archaeology should join hands to organise various programmes to depict the rebellion and other related incidents, which were of national and cultural significance.
The Minister has said the history of victorious selfless struggles launched by our forefathers to protect our freedoms should be subjected to appraisal and bequeathed to future generations.
"Unless this was done, we would be doing a disservice to the country and nation," the Minister has said.

Highway to prosperity
The Central Expressway, which was due to be opened in 2019, has been delayed due to a variety of factors including financial constraints. However, some sections are already under construction. The Central Expressway is perhaps the most promising out of all the existing and planned expressways, as it will link many economically significant areas with Colombo via the Kottawa hub.
The Government has just received good news in this regard, in the form of a loan of US$ 1 billion from China as funding for the construction of the Central Expressway Phase I. Chinese Envoy in Colombo Cheng Xueyuan has conveyed his Governments decision to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe at Temple Trees. The Chinese ambassador also apprised the Prime Minister that instructions have already been issued to the Export and Import Bank of China to process the loan. The Chinese Envoy has also requested the Government to expedite administrative and legal formalities regarding the loan.
This infusion of capital will no doubt help the Government to expedite the project which will bring massive benefits to the North Western, Central and North Central Provinces. The expressway will be built in four phases  Kadawatha to Meerigama (38 Km); Meerigama to Pothuhera (40 Km); Pothuhera to Galagedara (32.5 km) and Galagedara to Dambulla (60 Km). Significantly, some of the stretches will be built by local contractors, who are second to none anywhere in the world.
A journey from Colombo to Kandy now takes 4-5 hours, whereas the Central Expressway will cut it down to around 90 minutes (travelling at 100 Km/h). This will make a massive difference to the central region. The authorities, under the guidance of Highways Minister Kabir Hashim must now work towards clearing any red tape and expediting the Central Expressway project as any further delays will be costly economically. It is also advisable to complete this project before commitments are made towards other planned expressway projects.
This is not the only project going ahead with Chinese assistance. The Colombo Port City project is perhaps the biggest ever investment in Sri Lankas history. It will raise Colombos profile as an international financial hub. The Hambantota Port is another very important project. All these projects are no doubt very impressive, but we need more investments to make them really tick. For example, if more factories can be set up near the interchanges of the Central Expressway, it will be really easy to transport the finished products to Colombo for export. Likewise, the Hambantota Port area will be an export-oriented investment zone.
In fact, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has referred to these projects at a parley recently, citing three factors that can take Sri Lanka forward: Trade and Exports, Foreign Direct Investment and Infrastructure Development (such as the Central Expressway). These are the most vital cogs in the wheel of development.
Incidentally, Sri Lanka recorded its highest Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) of US$ 1,900 million in 2017 (not counting the US$ 1 billion Hambantota harbour). Several new significant foreign investment projects are underway, including two car assembly plants by Mahindra and Mahindra of India and a team of Japanese investors. A solar panel factory was opened earlier this week to supply local and export markets.
Sri Lanka also recorded the highest-ever exports of US$ 11.3 billion in 2017. A further boost is expected by 2020, though the medium term plan is to reach US$ 50 billion in exports. We need to diversify our exports further and also seek new markets for both traditional and non-traditional exports. The resumption of European and US GSP status is a shot in the arm for exports. New Free Trade Agreements (FTAs) with a host of countries will be a boon for exporters. However, there are many fabrications and misperceptions with regard to the FTAs and similar agreements  there should be a bigger awareness campaign via the media on the benefits of FTAs.
The Government plans to create three more Free Trade Zones in Bingiriya, Kalutara and Weligama apart from the Hambantota Free Trade Zone. This is a significant development, given that between 1978 and 1992, only three Free Trade Zones were developed. While the emphasis is on FDI, local investors too must be encouraged to set up operations within and outside investment zones. We need more investments in the outstation areas and with expressways connecting all the key cities, transporting their products will not be a problem. This will also expand private sector job creation. Sri Lanka has a low unemployment rate of 4.2 percent, but all efforts must be made to take this even lower.
Sri Lanka must make use of its widespread Diaspora network for investment and development. With the Governments decision to resume granting dual citizenship, many Diaspora members have settled down here for good (reverse migration) to contribute to the countrys development. Many others are willing to contribute from their adopted countries. Further incentives should be granted to expats and Diaspora members who wish to invest in their native country. Development must encompass a multi-pronged approach that combines exports, investment and trade, the three pillars of any burgeoning economy.

Historic Sri Lanka safety-match industry shouts SOS
A historic Sri Lankan industry spanning 100 year period and producing an essential item in the day-to-day lives of households, is bracing for the sudden dousing of their fires due to supply side pressure. A high level policy directive is now awaited after the intervention of the Industry Minister. 
A group of safety-match producing industry representatives led by Chairman of Sri Lanka Safety Match Makers Association (SLSMMA-and Chairman of Sun Match Co Ltd), B.D.R. Rajan informed the Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen about a crisis they are faced with on 8 May in Colombo. 
Our entire annual production of more than 12 billion safety matches is sold-out in local market with no exports due to their essential nature in day-to-day lives. However the production will stop at the end of this month and no alternatives in the market said Rajan. 
The problem is due to delay in receiving vital chemical imports-potassium chloride and red phosphorus- for our safety match production. We are producers and cannot directly import the chemicals since the manufacturers are not allowed to import directly. Two bidders/importers in Sri Lanka have been importing them from India and China and delivering to us. In recent times these essential chemicals are not imported and distributed to us on time. 
Certain delays in the tender system and the new testing requirement where testing by Industrial Technology Institute of Sri Lanka has resulted in total stoppage of regular chemical supplies to us. As a result all the 11 Lankan safety-match making companies are at a stage where they cannot run production anymore -and by the end of this month we are compelled to shut down.
We call upon the Industry Minister Bathiudeen to intervene and relax the new chemical regulations and red tape so that our production can re-start without delay. 
Minister Bathiudeen responded that safety match industry is an important sector in Lanka. It is one of the first Small and Medium Industries to commence here he said. He promptly contacted the relevant Ministries and requested clarifications and having received, instructed his top officials to immediately communicate the required changes to change regulations  so that imports resume and the production could recommence. 
A highly placed official from Defence Ministry said: We understand that there is a slowdown and are working on this. We too visited their factories after Minister Bathiudeens intervention. We are now awaiting for a directive from HE Presidents office on this, expected this week.

How Picassos journey from prodigy to icon revealed a genius
It's the morning before Christies Impressionist and modern art evening sale in New York City, and suddenly, there it is.
Just past the auction houses entrance at Rockefeller Center, Pablo Picassos vibrant geometric portrait Femme Accroupie (Jacqueline) jaunts down a hallway, carried by two art handlers dressed in black.
Painted in the south of France in October 1954, the canvas features Jacqueline Roque, Picassos 27-year-old mistress, later to be his wife, her arms clasped around a patchwork skirt of green and purple triangles. The artist, then 72, painted Femme Accroupie in a single day, and it gushes with vigorous brushstrokes, thick pigment, rambunctious shapes, misaligned eyes, and an inverted nose. Golden light rings Jacquelines body. Even off the wall, the painting commands attention.
That evening, auctioneer Adrien Meyer will start the bidding at $12 million, and it will quickly surge upward as two Christies representatives duel in a telephone bidding war on behalf of their anonymous clients. His back straight, his head jutting forward like a jaguar eyeing a peccary, Meyer will pivot between the pair until one of them signals defeat. Finally, with a bang of his hammer, hell announce the winning price: $32.5 million.
Astounding but not surprising. Nearly half a century after his death, Picasso continues to bewitch, confuse, entice, and provoke. From his early days as an artist, Picasso shattered our most primal understanding of the world with his fractured faces and splintered perspectives. He worked voraciously, reinventing his style at a rapid pacehis blue and rose periods, the African period, cubism, surrealismcreating thousands of sculptures, drawings, copperplate etchings, ceramics, and paintings. Just as Albert Einstein envisioned gravitational ripples in the cosmos, Picasso saw undulations in the world we live in, long before we saw them ourselves.
Sitting on a chartreuse couch in his living room in Geneva, Picassos son Claude contemplates the impact of his fathers work. He went on to destroy everything we were accustomed to, he says, and created a new vision for everyone.
How does a person evolve from newborn to mastermind How can a single soul redefine the way we see Picasso the man was messy. He loved life at the circus and death at the bullfights. He could be both boisterous and silent, amorous and domineering. But from his beginning as a prodigy to his final years painting musketeers and matadors, Picasso seemed destined for artistic greatness, his journey to genius fixed as firmly as paint on canvas. All the elements were there: a family that cultivated his creative passion, intellectual curiosity and grit, clusters of peers who inspired him, and the good fortune to be born at a time when new ideas in science, literature, and music energized his work and the advent of mass media catapulted him to fame. Unlike creative geniuses who died youngSylvia Plath at age 30, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart at 35, Vincent van Gogh at 37Picasso lived to the age of 91. The arc of his life was not only prodigious; it was long.
Pablo Picasso was born on October 25, 1881, in Mlaga, Spain, a baby so lethargic he was feared stillborn. He was revitalized, Picasso said, by a puff of smoke from his uncle Salvadors cigar. Landmarks of the artists childhood brim with vitality today in this sunlit Mediterranean city. A choir sings Man of La Manchas Impossible Dream in the Church of Santiago, where Picasso was baptized with holy water as a baby. Plaza de la Merced, where the artist etched his first drawings in the dust outside his home, bustles with tourists at cafs ordering, if they desire, a 12-euro ($15) hamburguesa Picasso. Pigeons light on the stones; the waters of the Alboran Sea lap at the shoreline; and Gypsies, like those who taught young Picasso to smoke a cigarette up his nostril and dance flamenco, continue to traverse Mlagas streets.
Sipping tea out of a red cup in the courtyard of the Museo Picasso Mlaga, the artists grandson Bernard Ruiz-Picasso reflects on how these early influences shaped Picassos art. Everything about this place is rich with history and sensuality, he says. Civilizations collided on the soil Picasso inhabited: Phoenician, Roman, Jewish, Moorish, Christian, and Spanish. Aromas filled the air. Gesturing to a nearby orange tree, Bernard says Picasso drew inspiration from the color of the fruits, from the violet flowers that drape Spains jacaranda trees, and from the beige and white stones of Mlagas 11th-century Alcazaba, set into Gibralfaro hill, steps from the museum.
He kept in his mind all those senses, all those images, all those smells and colors, which nourished and enriched his brain, says Bernard, who established the museumwhich opened in 2003with his mother, Christine Ruiz-Picasso, fulfilling his grandfathers wish.
Genius is almost always cultivated by parents and teachers who support and nurture the seeds of greatness. Picassos mother, Mara Picasso Lpez, prayed for a son and revered her firstborn child. His mother was gaga about him, says Claude Picasso, who is the legal administrator of his fathers artistic estate. From the start, young Pablo communicated through art, drawing before he could speak. His first word was piz, short for lpiz, or pencil. Like the composer Mozart, Picasso had a father in the business, Jos Ruiz Blasco, who was a painter and his sons first teacher. He was the best student his father ever had, Claude says. Picasso was still a child when his artistry began surpassing that of his father, who may have been not only astonished but petrified by the talent of his son, Bernard says.- National Geographic

Imagine, dream and believe!
The dreams of over 3000 students rest in the hands of Head Boy of Presidents College Kotte Dushen Thilaksha and his fellow prefects. Perfect Prefects features Thilaksha, a man who takes his responsibilities very seriously because it is key to everything.
The little ones in any school are especially at an age where they can be easily influenced. They can be influenced by something they see on television or at the movies or even by a book they read. This is exactly why there is a head prefect. This is so they have some guidance in life which can be a confusing time for a little boy or an adolescent. The little ones automatically develop qualities that they see in their seniors.
Amid juniors and seniors
There is a student population of 3500 in this school and all eyes are on the Head Prefect. Great expectation is placed on the young man who holds this post. The example he sets will be followed by all juniors and seniors. He will have an influence on the kinds of dreams they have and goals they will want to achieve. His deeds need to stand out more than his words. Because the little ones especially will imitate his behaviour, because he is like an older brother. Who else do they have to look to, if not the young man who holds such a position of privilege said Thilaksha
As Head Prefect he may need to mediate between two parties having a quarrel, or he may have to help a student going through a difficult time in adolescence. The reason why a prefect body is there is twofold  maintain disciple and maintain lines of communication between the students and themselves.
As a Prefect, I feel one must be straightforward and frank when dealing with others. He must be willing to take on responsibilities given to him by his school without shying away. He needs to be able to confidently face any challenges. He needs to have a positive mindset and perform his duties with maximum efficiency. I have achieved my dream of becoming a head prefect.
A prefect when encountering a challenge or difficulty in his path, he needs to properly identify the nature of this problem. Things are not what they always seem to be.
If it is a student-related problem involving a student asking him for help, then he should talk to an adult if it is necessary, stated Thilaksha.
Personality and charisma
Thilaksha pointed out that school life must not be limited to the books in the classroom. The school needs to develop that childs personality and his charisma. The school teaches one how to respect others.
My school has given me a lot. I feel I stand out in a crowd when at school because I am a Prefect. The students look up to us. A Prefect at Presidents College is one who excels in all activities like studies and sports. In addition to studies and sports, he has his Prefect duties. He must balance all three  studies, sports and duties and he should do it willingly, with enthusiasm and keenness. The way he balances these three will finally determine if he becomes the Head Prefect, explains Thilaksha.
Thilaksha feels that Nelson Mandela is a man to be admired, being the first black African President in South Africa. He did this because of his determination says Thilaksha.
He was jailed and faced such suffering behind bars. He is one reason why Apartheid was defeated because of his strength and wisdom. And he was victorious and triumphed. He took on this responsibility even most would not. And he did it because he had compassion, pointed out Thilaksha.
Sustainable policy
He feels that poverty is a problem in many parts of the world. How the money circulates is the issue here. For example, do you give money to an office colleague who may spend it on entertainment or do you give it to the beggar on the road who is starving However, it needs to be sustainable. And that is providing regular jobs.
In order to help the poor, you need to be fairly well to do yourself. You need to be willing and passionate about this. Also, you need to be a good leader. If you are fairly well off and have good leadership qualities then maybe it would be possible for you and others like you to help these people. A normal person would find it difficult to do this. Unemployment is a burden on the country and its economy, added Thilaksha.
Racism is something that needs to be eradicated in society. In many schools in the country, there is a mix of children from different backgrounds and religions.
I have friends from so many different backgrounds in my school. We live in harmony and we trust and respect each other. If we become selfish that is when things start to turn bitter. After all, we are all Sri Lankans born in this country. We are all Sri Lankans, said Thilaksha.
Thilakshas message to anyone is when accepting a job give it a good thought, because once you accept the responsibility then you need to see things through. Once you make a promise, then you need to fulfil it. Do not neglect your studies because your studies are the reason why you became a Head Prefect. A Head Prefect is someone who balances everything perfectly  studies, sports and duties and excels in them.
Resolving problems
He must be educated and he must be able to handle responsibilities with courage and he needs to be forthright. He needs to be a master strategist resolving problems. Some people break under pressure and some people thrive under pressure. Also, it would help if he tries to understand what brings about this pressure. Then we need to identify how to put an end to it. Also talking to someone you trust can help, explained Thilaksha.
Thilaksha points out that if a leader works for his people he will be recognized and rewarded by society.
He does not have to go around advertising himself. They will know him by his deeds. He needs to have worked for his community and then people will believe and trust in him, said Thilaksha
I want to think my father and mother and my younger brother, for everything they have done for me. They have all been there for me because this post needs a lot of support. I want to also thank my Principal U D D G Ariyarathna and teachers in charge Shirani Asoka, Rasika Kandamulla, Tanya Lankatilaka and Venerable Denagama Sudhamma Thera, said Thilaksha.

Imam-ul-Haq sees Pakistan to  victory over Test debutants Ireland
DUBLIN, Tuesday: Pakistan debutant Imam-ul-Haq saw his side to victory as Irelands first match in mens Test cricket ended in a gallant last-day defeat by five wickets at Malahide on Tuesday.
Pakistan, set a seemingly modest 160 to win, after earlier making Ireland follow-on, collapsed to 14 for three before lunch on the fifth day.
But 22-year-old left-handed opener Imam, the nephew of Pakistan selection chief and former Test batsman Inzamam-ul-Haq, responded to the pressure with 74 not out -- his maiden fifty at this level.
Together with Babar Azam, who made 59 after being dropped on nine, he kept Ireland at bay during a fourth-wicket stand of 126.
Imam hit the winning runs as grey clouds threatening rain hung over Malahide.
Victory was a good way for Pakistan to prepare for the first of a two-Test series against England at Lords starting on May 24.
Just four balls into their chase, Pakistan saw Azhar Ali edge Tim Murtagh to Paul Stirling at first slip.
Haris Sohail (seven) fell next, well taken in the gully by Ed Joyce off towering fast bowler Boyd Rankin as Irelands two former England internationals combined.
And 13 for two became 14 for three in 4.3 overs when Middlesex paceman Murtagh produced a superb delivery to bowl Asad Shafiq between bat and pad for one.
Imam, who bats in spectacles, showed a maturity beyond many of his more experienced top-order colleagues.
He struck two fine fours off Stuart Thompson, a square cut followed by a square drive.
Ireland needed to take every chance that came their way but, with Babar yet to add to his interval score, he was dropped in the slips by Andrew Balbirnie.
Imam, having cover driven a four off Rankin, completed a 61-ball fifty with seven boundaries -- the third time he had reached the landmark this tour after half-centuries in warm-up matches against Kent and Northamptonshire.
Babar, cashed in to make a 61-ball fifty.
But with Pakistan 20 runs shy of victory, a mix-up saw Babar run out.
There was still time for Ireland to take a couple more wickets but by then the match had escaped their grasp.
Earlier, Ireland were dismissed for 339 in their second innings. Kevin OBrien, who on Monday became the first Ireland batsman to score a Test hundred, fell to his first ball Tuesday as Mohammad Abbas had him caught by Haris at slip for 118. The Irish, resuming on 319 for seven, saw Abbas then take three wickets for 12 runs in 22 balls, the paceman finishing with an innings haul of five for 66 in 28.3 overs.
Only three sides in the 141-year history of Test cricket had won after being made to follow on and only one mens team -- Australia in the inaugural Test against England at Melbourne in 1877 -- had enjoyed a victory in their debut match at this level.
Ireland were facing an innings defeat when man-of-the-match OBrien came in at 95 for four but, ably assisted by Stuart Thompson, who made 53, he turned the tide during a seventh-wicket partnership of 114. But after Tyrone Kane had seen out Tuesdays opening over from Mohammad Amir, who took his 100th Test wicket on Monday, Abbas struck.
OBrien going down on one knee to attempt a slashing drive off a wide half-volley from Abbas, nicked to Haris.
A crestfallen OBrien bowed his head in frustration and dropped his bat as he trudged off the field.
But the 34-year-old had every reason to be proud of an innings that spanned five hours, 44 minutes and saw him face 217 balls with 12 fours. AFP

NEW DELHI Tuesday: Indias Shashank Manohar has been re-elected chairman of the International Cricket Council for another two years, the sports world governing body said Tuesday. 
Manohar, who became the ICCs first independent chairman in 2016, was elected unopposed for a second term after a tenure marked by broad reforms. 
He was the sole nominee for the position. 
As chairman he spearheaded efforts to restructure the ICC to curb the dominance of crickets three wealthiest nations, Australia, India and England. 
The 60-year-old former head of the Indian board successfully revised the ICCs governance and pushed for the appointment of its first independent female director. 
Over the next two years we can look forward to launching a global strategy for the sport in partnership with our members so we can grow the game and ensure more of the world can enjoy cricket, Manohar said in an ICC statement. 
The sport is in good health but we are the guardians of the game and we must continue to work hard to maintain that.
Manohar resigned from the post last year but was persuaded by the ICC board to retake the helm. AFP

New Delhi, Tuesday: India aims to launch a womens edition of the popular Indian Premier League cricket tournament in the next three years, a top official said Tuesday.
As part of the build-up, top international women players will take part in a Twenty20 exhibition game at Mumbais Wankhede Stadium later this month.
We are planning to get a womens IPL in place in two to three years, Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) administrator Vinod Rai told AFP.
No firm details of the new league have yet been revealed, but pressure for a womens IPL has been building since India reached the final of the womens World Cup in England last year.
Women cricketers from Australia, England and South Africa will play an Indian team under IPL rules in the May 22 game in Mumbai. The match to be played between a BCCI XI and IPL XI will take place ahead of the first (mens IPL) playoff at the Wankhede Stadium, Rai said.
The Mithali Raj-led India lost to England in the World Cup final last year, and received a rapturous welcome on their return. AFP

Indian Army Chief impressed with SLAs nation-building roles
Military salutes, including a Guard of Honour and a Guard Turnout formally greeted the Indian Army Chief of Army Staff (COAS) General Bipin Rawat, who is now in Sri Lanka on a goodwill tour at the invitation of his Sri Lankan counterpart Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, when the former called at the Army Headquarters on Monday (14) morning to meet his host as the first formal leg of the itinerary in Sri Lanka.
An elegant and colour-rich Guard of Honour at the Army Headquarters presented arms and extended honours to the visiting Indian Army Chief on arrival in accordance with military traditions after a formal military Guard Turnout greeted him at the entrance to the premises.
Adjutant General of the Army Headquarters Major General Shavendra Silva greeted the visiting Army Chief of India at the entry to the parade ground after the Commanding Officer of the Headquarters Battalion received him in conformity with military procedures.
Chief of Staff Major General Dampath Fernando, Sri Lanka Army Volunteer Force Commandant Major General Piyal Wickramaratne, Deputy Chief of Staff Major General Ajith Kariyakarawana and all other Principal Staff Officers were introduced to the visiting Army Chief by Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake at the foyer to the Commanders Secretariat before the Army Chief of India was ushered to the office of the Commander.
General Bipin Rawat and Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake shared views on bilateral and current issues that are relevant to both organizations.
The visiting Indian Army Chief was keen on learning how the Sri Lanka Army has embarked on nation-building roles while transforming its soldiers to be capacity-based and skill-oriented, arming them with globally recognized National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) and related training in different spheres of expertise.
The Commander of the Army explained how the much-needed workforce for nation-building is groomed, irrespective of their soldiering in teeth arms, infantry or services by exposing them to this skilled sphere and cited how it has worked in the field of construction, repairs, rebuilding and infrastructure development pointing to the ongoing reconstruction of agricultural tanks in the Eastern and North Central Provinces.
Lieutenant General Senanayake opined that a soldier, generally regarded as a 'destructor', should be more productively used as a 'constructor' instead in peacetime for challenges in nation-building because of their skills and further enlightened the visiting Army chief on how the Army has been engaged in a wide range of civil-military cooperation projects in the North and East and elsewhere for bettering livelihoods and welfare benefits of all regional civilians.
General Bipin Rawat was equally interested in the specific model the Sri Lanka Army has successfully tapped in the rehabilitation of former LTTE combatants and also how the Sri Lanka Army's own 5R concept (Rehabilitation, Reconstruction, Reintegration, Resettlement and Reconciliation), has been implemented for revitalization of the country's battered infrastructure during 30-year long conflict.
During the cordial meeting, discussions also centred on ongoing training programmes for Sri Lankan Army Officers and possibilities of further enhancement of training openings. Both military leaders agreed that the spirits of good understanding and cooperation that prevails between both organizations should be further strengthened and encouraged as friendly neighbours. They both also discussed the importance of evaluating security threats in the region and tackling them through exchange of information and intelligence.
Exchange of mementos as symbols of memory and goodwill between both Army chiefs took place thereafter.

JAT creates paints from dried flower petals
JAT Holdings recently launched a revolutionary new paint, which combines ancient traditions and cutting-edge manufacturing technology.
Petal Paint is a unique paint that has been created with the pigments from dried flower petals and transformed into liquid paint using innovation from the Research and Development team at JAT Holdings.
This unique initiative will breathe new life into discarded temple flowers, which are a plenty in the country. Once turned into liquid paint, it will be used in the creation and restoration of sacred Temple murals in Sri Lanka.

We created Petal Paint to give something back to Sri Lankas heritage and culture, says Richard Gunawardene  Head of Marketing at JAT Holdings. Petal Paint combines the best of our traditional culture  the use of pigments from nature  with the most advanced technology in paint manufacturing, to create a paint that matches the traditional temple mural colors and also provides a more long-lasting solution to temple artists.
Petal Paint will soon be made available to artists working on Temple Murals. The initial colors in the range are Lotus Red, Pigeonwing Blue, Trumpet Yellow, Marigold Orange and Temple Flower White,and will be available in 200 ml tins.

The Hambantota port and Mattala airport are catalysts of development. Those who direct criticism against them do so due to ignorance, said former speaker Chamal Rajapaksa addressing the gathering at the Hambantota Urban Council.
The meeting was held to welcome the newly elected Mayor Eraj Ravindra Fernando and the members elected to the Hambantota Urban Council.
Rajapaksa said that the far-sighted policies of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa brought a new era and a period of transition to the Hambantota district, which had been a backward district for decades. He said that Hambantota is a multicultural and multiracial city where people live in harmony. When tsunami caused destruction to Hambantota in 2004, everybody was treated equally without taking into consideration caste, creed or race.
The first-ever dry zone botanical garden, the first-ever safari park, the international convention hall and the administration complex were set up under the greater Hambantota concept. The mega development projects inaugurated bythe previous regime have come to a standstill. As a result, those who engaged themselves in these projects now remain jobless and find it impossible to keep their home fires burning.

Malaysia's Anwar Ibrahim freed from jail after Mahathir election win

Malaysian politician Anwar Ibrahim has been freed from jail, paving the way for his return to politics.
Once seen as a potential future leader, he had been jailed on charges of sodomy and corruption after falling out with the government.
Malaysia's new Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad sought a pardon for Anwar, which was granted on Wednesday morning.
Mahathir has promised to step aside for Anwar to become prime minister within two years.
The politician was jailed for a second time three years ago on what he said were trumped-up sodomy charges.
For years he had been heading Malaysia's opposition movement, which has just defeated the former ruling party for the first time in the country's history.
Last week's shock election victory followed a reconciliation between Anwar and 92-year old Mahathir, who sacked and jailed him 20 years ago during his first stint as prime minister.
Anwar walked free out of a hospital in the capital Kuala Lumpur where he has been undergoing treatment.
Supporters camped out at the hospital trailed him to the Istana Negara royal palace where he met Mahathir.
"Long live Anwar," supporters on motorbikes yelled as they pull into the royal compound in support of their newly-freed leader.
"He is a symbol of freedom to Malaysians like me," 59-year old Ahmad Samsuddin told the BBC.
"Finally. It feels like the tide of change is turning in Malaysia after so many years of injustice. Today is a historic day with Anwar's release and will get even better."
Extraordinary twists and turns
The story of the relationship Mahathir and Anwar is one of extraordinary twists and turns.
During the 1990s they were political allies, serving as prime minister and deputy respectively.
But Anwar was sacked in 1998 after falling out with his political mentor and as jailed a year later for abuse of power. In 2000 he was convicted of sodomy, and given an additional nine-year-term.
In 2004 his conviction was overturned and he led the opposition to unprecedented gains - though remained short of victory - in the 2008 and 2013 general elections.
One year later when he was heading into a state election he seemed likely to win, he was sent back to jail.
Events took a remarkable turn earlier this year, when his former political enemy Mahathir Mohamad announced he would join forces with the opposition and run for top office once again.
Mahathir said he was sick of the corruption allegations plaguing the incumbent Najib Razak, another of his former allies.
One condition for Mahathir being allowed to lead the coalition was that he agreed to secure a royal pardon for Anwar who remained popular with his supporters.
Mahathir agreed, and further said he intended to hand the prime ministerial post to Anwar within two years.

Sydney, Tuesday: A number of African athletes who went missing from the Commonwealth Games last month have resurfaced seeking advice on gaining asylum in Australia, refugee advocates said Tuesday.
More than a dozen were suspected of fleeing during the showpiece event on the Gold Coast. Among them were competitors from Rwanda, Uganda and Sierra Leone, while authorities have also been seeking to verify the whereabouts of eight athletes from conflict-hit Cameroon -- one third of the central African countrys 24-strong team.
The Refugee Advice and Casework Service (RACS) group in Sydney said it had received enquiries from several of them but declined to reveal the exact number or the countries of origin.
Every person who seeks asylum in Australia should be subject to the same thorough investigation of their claims, be they students, visitors, workers or athletes, RACS solicitor Sarah Dale said in a statement. AFP

The term of the current national cricket selection committee headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy ended yesterday and according to Sri Lanka Cricket sources they would be submitting the names for the new selection committee to the Sports Minister shortly.
There is likelihood that the majority of members who served in the current committee namely Labrooy, Gamini Wickremasinghe, Gerry Woutersz, Sajith Fernando and Asanka Gurusinha will be retained for another term.
They were appointed to the post in September last year and during the past eight months have performed their duties quite adequately. Their last assignment was picking the Sri Lanka Test squad to West Indies and the Sri Lanka A team to Bangladesh.
The senior Sri Lanka team is due to make a tour of the Caribbean on May 25 for a three-Test series while the A team is scheduled to play a series of two 4-day matches and 3 one-day limited-over games against Bangladesh A in June.

No action should be taken against war heroes  SP Governor
No legal action should be taken against any war heroes for whatsoever alleged crime committed during war-time, Southern Province Governor Marshal Perera, PC said at the Southern Province Ranaviru Commemoration 2018.
The event was held yesterday at the Ranviru Monument in Galle city under his patronage.
War-time is not a normal time. War is inhumane and it is a struggle between life and death. During war-time the law falls silent, the Governor said.
We hold this commemoration to remember the sacrifices made by our valiant service personnel of the Sri Lanka defence forces to annihilate the ruthless LTTE to save our motherland. Hence if any crime has been reportedly committed by our war heroes during operations, they should be pardoned.
There are many unjust allegations against the valiant members of our defence forces supposedly committed during the last phase of the war in 2009. They are quite baseless and untrue. Many civilians were rescued at the hands of our soldiers. Even the father and mother of Prabhakaran were saved by our war heroes, the Governor observed
No country has initiated legal action against any combatant for any reported crime during wartime or in action.
During World War II, the two Japanese cities - Hiroshima and Nagasaki - were completely destroyed and thousands of people died. No one took legal action against the perpetrators of such criminal acts. So I am against any legal action taken against our war heroes.
Southern Province Chief Minister said no member of the defence forces has been legally charged for any act done during the war.
Ranviru Seva Authority Chairperson Anoma Fonseka also spoke.

NTC approves 6.56% bus fare hike
The Cabinet has yesterday approved a proposal to increase bus fares by 6.56% in view of the fuel price hike.
National Transport Commission (NTC) Chairman M.A.P. Hemachandra told the Daily News that the annual bus fare revision would take place every year in July and bus fares are revised based on a special formula.
They take into account various factors such as the rate of inflation, the price of a litre of diesel, electricity charges, maintenance costs and the price of tyres and spare parts.
The Committee of experts who convened on May 14 to discuss the revision of bus fares has decided to increase the bus fare by 6.56% considering the twelve factors related to the industry.
The minimum fare will however remain at Rs.10 and this revision will apply for both SLTB and private buses with affect from today. He further said all private bus unions summoned at a meeting held in NTC yesterday agreed to this bus fare hike. This increase will be in accordance with the annual bus fares revision taking place in June or July each year, in keeping with a so called Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) signed between the State transport authorities and the Private bus operators.
Lanka Private Bus Owners Association (LPBOA) President Gemunu Wijeratne told the Daily News that all private bus associations have rejected the 6.56% increase in view of the fact that they asked for a minimum 10 percent increase.
There will be private bus strike from midnight today to compel the authorities to grant a 10 percent increase. In addition to the diesel price hike, several other factors such as overhead costs for service and repair, crew salaries, tyres and tubes and other maintenance costs need to be considered when formulating the bus fare revision. But, the NTC has totally neglected these facts. So private bus unions have been looking forward to a bus fare hike for the one year. It is the Transport Minister Nimal Siripala De Silva who should be held responsible for the inconvenience faced by commuters due to the bus strike form midnight today, he added.

Ode to a tree deity
Having read a few reviews and opinions expressed, I had to remind myself to be open-minded in watching the film. Then again, I have refused to be caged by isms when appreciating a work of creative art, -in all the diverse forms, it manifests in.
The first impression was that I liked it. I liked it very much. It should be appreciated that the film approaches the audience with a fresh approach. The setting in terms of timescale is the not so ancient past. But it does represent a certain period and community with conventional beliefs and values.
The people not so sophisticated or affluent. The focus is on an entertainer in the form of an artist who provides puppet shows as a profession. A story of an apprentice under a master who happens to be also his guardian. As often referred to he is family, like his own son. They not only perform but also makes the puppets who represented various walks of life. It was not only a profession to them but also a way of life.
Intimate manner
Incidents prove that the young man was quite close to the puppets. Often he addresses them in a friendly and even in an intimate manner. Maybe being an adopted boy he would have felt a certain empathy with them. He seems to have confidence in confiding in them when the need to confess certain emotions arose. Maybe because he was sure they would not misunderstand or judge him. The conduct or relationship does not seem artificial or strange. Just as in the modern era people may converse their computers or vehicles. The barrier between reality and relationship so flimsy that it is almost non-existent although the young man was well aware that they were only puppets with he worked with. The aforementioned relationships are not so strange nor are they limited to a certain era. let me quote a poem that I had composed sometime back. The title of the said poem is 'In Good Company'.
In Good Company
Just when did I start communicating
With vegetation The plants and
The trees around me
Maybe more respect to
The tall aged trees.
And more compassion to the
Smiling happy flowering plants.
Was it after I started talking to
The birds and the squirrels
Talking to my pets  the cat
And the dogs was, a habit.
When was it exactly
After I realized that
They were more trustworthy
And less deceitful than humans
Unlikely to betray or mock
Un- judgmental
Or was it just the natural need
Of good company
Like having an argument
With the car
Or an affair with the computer
Then why the selection and gradation
On which grounds does that operate
The master craftsman, aware of his duties as a guardian and out of affection and concern for the young man, arranges a marriage for him. The would-be bride was attractive and the consent is given. The prospect of a married life would have aroused many hopes and dreams in the mind-opening new vistas for him in imagination. Dormant desires would have arisen in anticipation through the attraction. This is proved by the fact that his mind refuses to recognize the rejection of him by the bride expressed in a not so subtle manner. He is shattered though he pretends to overcome the disappointment. Yet one is made to ask if he really was able to repress the kindled emotions, through logic and reasoning.
Traditional modes
Simultaneously attention is drawn to the traditional belief in deities residing in trees. The tree deities from whom the trees are freed before they were cut down. They needed wood to make life-size puppets, and for this, they had to cut down massive trees in the woods. Hence it was logical to bring in the custom as well as the traditional modes of communication with the supernatural. Hence the magic and ritual theme does not prove to be an artificial intrusion. Mysticism was an integral part of the social life, a reality in their way of living, an essential in their realm of comprehension. They turned to the supernatural in times of need for solace and aid, where emotions such as fear are negotiated.
The only close association Osanda had was with the daughter of his guardian. It is obvious that she did possess some kind of attraction to him. But to this he definitely could not respond to him, she was only a sister. He could have never conceived her as a 'woman' he desired. They were mere siblings.
The psychological turmoil instigated by the proposal and rejection is aptly displayed by the manner he carves out a new female puppet in nude. The creation is so realistic that the master asks him to show it to no-one in the fear of the 'evil eye'. The sister is enraged since she seems to believe that she stands for the woman of his desire. Hence it is obvious that it is the manifestation of his inner-psychological condition.

The old Puttalam-Mannar Road
I read in the papers with sadness that the old Puttalam-Mannar Road, today a magnificent highway, has been closed due to floods in Eluwankulama, after the opening of the spill gates of the Angmuwa reservoir. It is a matter for puzzlement as to why the precious overflow is not collected using a system of canals similar to the aqueducts the Romans used to bring water to Rome, into minor reservoirs, without allowing it to empty into the sea and used during the seasons of drought. As the biblical warning goes, seasons of plenty are often followed by seasons of famine.
My maternal great grandfather was a trader. He carried his goods in a bullock cart, with only the carter for company all the way on foot from Negombo to Mannar using church verandas in between to sleep and using the old Puttalam-Mannar Road then a jungle path infested by bandits. Like a Shaolin priest he was a master of the art of self defense easily putting the highway robbers to take to their heels. On the return journey he brought goods like dry fish to be sold in Negombo. To the unthinking reader it may sound like bringing coal to Newcastle. No, not at all because the Mannar Balaya Kelawalla, Katta dry fish have a special flavour that make them a gourmets delight, a delicacy much sought after, fetching a premium price.
My maternal great grandfather through sheer hard work became a wealthy man having enough resources to send his only son Robert Cyril, in a family of four, to St Josephs College Colombo. He was brilliant. During the prize giving at the Bonjean Hall he could hardly return to his seat when he was summoned to receive another.
Executive engineers
His prize winning subjects apart from the General Proficiency were English, Latin, Greek, Maths, Physics and Chemistry. It was after he demonstrated his brilliance the family decided to send him to England where he breezed through the exams to qualify as a Fellow of both the Institute of Civil and Structural Engineers. His spoken and written English were magnificent often standing on a soap box with the like-minded in Hyde Park, haranguing the crowd demanding independence for the Irish for which he was decorated by Pope Pius XI at the Vatican.
He returned to Ceylon and joined the PWD as an executive engineer and given the task of building the Mannar steel bridge where on a brass plaque reverted on the bridge is the name Robert Cyril Fernando, executive engineer, a fashion at that time where steel bridges carried the names of executive engineers most of them, albeit, British and Scottish names. He married a rich mans daughter from Katana and settled there but never forgot his mother who was then a widow, sending his driver every month in his Bentley to Negombo with a bottle of Hennessy brandy and a handsome stipend for her upkeep.
Prof. E.O.E. Pereira who was attached to the TransWork office of the PWD in Fort, before he became the Dean of the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Ceylon, knowing the connection, spoke highly of my grand uncle and admitted that he eagerly awaited to read his annual reports because they were written in the classy style of Macaulay.
Shakespeares master pieces
I was barely a couple of years old when he came to his ancestral home in Negombo during Christmas for the mid-night Mass and to wish his mother and sisters. After wishing them he will sit in the verandah, order the driver to bring the Christmas hamper and sit till morning enjoying with his brother-in-law and my father.
One Christmas he gave my father, then an English school teacher, the complete bound volumes of Shakespeares master pieces written in Old English. They say I am a chip of the old block. That is not the truth but a mere fantasy if I may quote the words of Euripides in Ion in 44 BC. I am unworthy to tie my grand uncles shoe laces. The only thing I can think that is in my favour is I am still lean as a lamp post, the same figure l had when I was burning the tracks. His size made him studious, more interested in smart books than sports.
He steadily climbed the ladder and days after he was appointed Provincial Engineer, a step below Director of Public Works, he had complained of a side pain which the doctors diagnosed as appendicitis. An appendectomy was undertaken. When the surgeons were struggling to find the appendix his mother, a widow, who was kneeling and praying outside, told the others she heard the tolling of bells. He was 53.
If he had lived he would have been the first Singhalese Director of Public Works. The Central Hospital then was not the magnificent structure it is today. I remember my mother telling me, then a tot, to climb a chair and see through the fan light and tell her what was happening. I remember seeing the surgeons and physicians by the bedside, and hearing the heavy breathing and the smell of the whiffs of Chloroform.
In the old tombs what we find is not the familiar Requiest in Pace, Rest In Peace but Tradere in Pace, Sleep in Peace. Those words l offer my grand uncle whose memory I cherish.
I have drawn a long list of names of my wife, a Buddhist and her parents also Buddhists and my parents and ancestors all Catholics, in whose memories requiem Masses in Latin will be celebrated at the little Church in Kurana. My grand uncles name is there next to Fr Benedict Fernando, my Confessor, not a half baked but a fully baked theologian and a friend, at St Josephs College.

Power outages reported in several areas restored
Power outages were reported from many places in Colombo after a tripping of the Biyagama-Pannipitiya power grid disrupted power supply to four substations, officials confirmed.
Power cuts were reported from Ratmalana, Dehiwala, Pannipitiya and Sri Jayawardenapura. Chief Engineer at the Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) for the Dehiwela region Saumya Kumarawadu told Daily News that the 220 kilowatt Biyagama-Pannipitiya line had tripped causing the power disruption. The issue has been looked into and swiftly resolved. The Dehiwala area received power by mid-day. I believe the head office may call for an investigation into the matter. He said the disruption could be a maintenance issue.

Priority must be given to resolve rural peoples problems
Rural people are facing many unresolved problems. Resolving them is the major duty and responsibility of the government, Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardena said.
He was addressing State officials at a meeting at the Badulla Town Hall following the opening of several development projects in the area launched by the Home Affairs Ministry.
Minister Abeywaradena said people in the North and East were going to Geneva to complain about alleged violation of their fundamental rights when people in the South are undergoing similar problems.
Abeywardena said many people considered the President or the legislature is omnipotent. This was false. It was the ordinary citizens who are really omnipotent, the Minister said.
He said that according to the scientific assignment of ministerial subjects, his ministry was entrusted with the district administration in addition to the rural and regional administration. Kachcheris, Divisional Secretaries, Grama Niladaris, Development Officers and the Registrar Generals Offices are closely related to the people. They cater to peoples needs from their birth to death. They constitute a network of mechanisms to protect and safeguard peoples fundamental rights, the Minister said.
Peoples rights were enshrined in the Constitution. The Establishment Code had clearly laid down the procedure to be adopted by these institutions to serve the people, he said.
A big responsibility, therefore, has been put on public servants. They cannot shirk that responsibility at any time they want for any reason, the Minister said.

Prominence for Loincloth
All media highlighted pictures of the peasants, backed by the JVP controlled Sri Lanka Govi Sammelanaya leaders, demonstrating in the city clad in their traditional field dress, the Amude [Loincloth] a couple of years back. The Government withdrew the heavily subsidised issue of fertilizer and substituted it with alternative schemes. The protest was aimed at conveying to the public and authorities on the negative effects of the fertilizer subsidy withdrawal. However, some sections of media appeared to be a little cautious, quite understandably, over referring to the term Amude, which is fast becoming an obsolete word in the Sinhala dictionary. A reference to the recent past shows the significance of amude.
Wijayananda Dhanayake, the controversial ex-PM, once chose to protest the scarcity of textiles during Sirimavos economically disastrous rule in the 1970s, by attending Parliament clad in Amude. The government restricted textile imports, allowing only cheap varieties described by the public as bhumi-thel redi. [clothes with an odour of kerosene] Our newspaper photographers had a field day capturing Dhaha in his novel parliamentary attire, though authorities quite rightly disallowed the veteran legislator from entering the chambers.
The reason given being, Improperly attired, as per a statement by Clerk-of-the-House [as Secretary-General was then known] was loosely interpreted by a junior member of his staff as Half-naked at the door, provoking the Thomian English literati turned maverick politician from South to rejoin, I say, do you know that the so-called Half-naked Pakeer from India was granted an audience with the King of England whenever he sought one Realizing that the staff member was clueless whom the person mentioned, Daha explained: I say, now go and tell your Chief that Mahatma Gandhi wore a simple dhoti [loincloth] and shawl, an extra piece over his shoulders and that he stuck to this dress code even when he was entertained at Buckingham Palace, and Daha returned to MPs restroom to change.
This simple dress of a square piece of cloth known as the loincloth, which the peasant of our country traditionally used during field work to satisfactorily cover the non-exposable parts of male anatomy was worn by both former Presidents, JR Jayewardene and R Premadasa at annual Vap Magul ceremony or the traditional commencement of paddy cultivation at Maha season replicating the ritual practiced by ancient kings in these regions. The former Head of State, a son of a Richmondite farmer however, chose to wear the tucked-up sarong, the dress he is more comfortable with before he stepped into the muddy field for the same purpose during his tenure as President.
Paddy Lands Act of 1958
Admiring the newspaper photographs of the events, my nostalgia took me back to Kindergarten days in the late 1940s. The mother of one of my classmates, together with the female teacher struggled to dress my friend Goviya, for the fancy dress competition at school concert; but was compelled to seek the help of Head Mistresses rickshaw-man to help in the endeavour.
I recall the Paddy Lands Act of 1958, an important piece of socialist reforms introduced by Marxist Phillip Gunawardena, Minister of Agriculture and Lands and father of Dinesh, under S.W.R.D. Bandaranaikes 1956 government. This progressive legislation was designed to remove injustices caused to the peasantry, as one third of islands paddy lands were cultivated by non-owners under the age-old Ande system.
The main feature of the proposal was to increase the Ande Goviyas share from the traditional one-fourth or half of the harvest to three-fourths. The Act specified that unless the owner or his family members are directly involved in the work on cultivation or make a reasonable contribution to costs, the owner becomes entitled to one-fourth only.
The vast landowners who declined to accept such a self-sacrificing beating without a fight got around the right-wing faction of Cabinet led by C P de Silva, Maithreepala Senanayake, Stanley de Soyza, and Wimala to teach a lesson to Philip- SWRD duo. They were the famous ginger-group in the Cabinet who staged an unprecedented Cabinet Strike in 1958 [unparalleled in the history of global parliamentary democracy], who conspired to disrupt the attempt. At a secret meeting held at Buddharakkitas Kelaniya temple abode, [the venue where they conspired to assassinate the Prime Minister a year later].
All negotiations to get at least the temples exempted from the Bill failed [Buddharakkitha owned large paddy land holdings]: as planned, a group of about 50 men, most of them like the modern JVP goviyas never had been to a paddy field, was brought into the temple premises by Health Minister Wimala, the exonerated 6th accused in Bandaranaike assassination case, who also enjoyed free access to Buddharakkitas inner chambers at Kelaniya, [a famous word-of-mouth gossip in the absence of social media]. The men were dressed in loincloths and taught on the art of holding the mammoty over the shoulder.
Anti-Philip slogans
The Farmers were dropped opposite parliamentary complex in Galle Face: they started the protest shouting anti-Philip slogans. Before they could move up to the entrance to Parliament building, a considerable section of the 15,000-strong Philips Harbour and Dock Workers Union, the most powerful in the port, was unleashed by trade union leaders to unmercifully attack the Amude clad Goviyas. The demonstrators unfamiliar to the environments ran helter-skelter. Some of them in confusion and disorder had to leave the alien dress Amudes behind and run for life.
It is not only the village peasant, but habitually every male six or seven decades ago, as Robert Knox once wrote unless on a special occasion, was seen in Amudes, a quite respectable casual dress, especially among the Kandyan peasantry.
Let me conclude this note, by quoting a famous anecdote on the hill country's traditional polygamists of good old days when two brothers shared a single wife under the same roof for reasons best known to them. [Students of sociology a theses for research] As the saying goes, each brother would hang his, lets say, loincloth over the lock-less door to signify to the other brother, who enjoyed equal rights too, about his lawful occupation of the precincts with the common bride under the serenely rising moon-radiated magnificent sylvan beams that pierced the cadjans to fall on the romantic reed-mat.
Should we fight shy to call it Amude After all, it is our ancestors traditional casual-wear.
All the alterations I have made in my course of life have been affected by momentous occasions, and they have been made after such a deep deliberation that I have hardly had to regret them. And I did them, as I could not help doing them. Such a radical alteration  in my dress,  I effected in Madura. The Mahatma says Madurai gave him the strength to shed his conventional attire for loincloth at last.

THE RESTLESS QUESTING OF MANS SPIRIT
Nalini Jayasuriya the well known multimedia artist, musician and author is back in Sri Lanka. She was a teacher at S. Thomas' College, Mt. Lavinia before she went abroad. Her artistic creativity covers a wide range of painting, sculpture, pottery, enamelling on metal to stained glass.
She is a graduate of Yale University and Luce Moore Professor. She taught at the University of Copenhagen and also at the universities of Geneva, Tokyo, Manila, Thailand, Sweden, Pakistan and Yale. She had the distinction of exhibiting her works in London, Paris, Bonn, Zurich, New York, Kentucky, Washington DC, Tokyo and Jerusalem.
Refines and transforms
A dress of fire once worn may not be denied; the experience remains", says Nalini Jayasuriya. In its awesome form and mood lire illumines, refines and transforms. Fire translates and symbolizes both the unmeaning reality of impermanence and the numinous elation of renewal.
How would you as a multimedia artist and historian define art
I do not think art can be tested or defined by rules of reason. The senses and emotions together with a certain spiritual zeal constitute the most powerful human motive forces providing creative energies for the alert and discerning spirit. The arts are the responses of these forces, says Nalini.
Art transcends the particular frame of reference and is really an expression of the consciousness of freedom not contingent but necessary, not relative but absolute. Art is disclosive as it informs inspires idealizes and sanctifies translating and transforming ideas and beliefs and restoring them to a creative understanding of truth. The human race responds from a common universal vocabulary of sensuous experience differing in interpretation but not in meaning, The needs of man are the same; so the icons remain undiminished. The history of art is a history of how the multiform world has been conceived visually.
It is a history of seeing through the mind and heart and of making that seeing real. Over 30,000 years ago the man wrote through pictures, read and spoke through dance and prayed through magical and ritualistic forms. The elements and the inexorable processes of nature that he feared assumed forms and became his gods and he appeased them with an array of creative responses.
Powers beyond
Fear may have been the energy that devised these unique forms of sight, sound, movement and silence. Man feared extinction and sought 'powers beyond himself to meet the caprice of a mysterious uncompromising world and his imagination provided the answers he needed.
The history of art, unlike science and philosophy, is neither progressive nor stable. Emotions, sensations ideas and beliefs dictate new forms with sudden and almost irrational fervour. There is a mercurial and ambiguous quality of art, but then these are the elements that qualify true and serious creative expression. Each period of art history has produced its own distinctive witness and confession and as a movement of continuous resilience and innovative power, the artistic enterprise has exceeded all another human effort.
There is a compelling human need to know beyond knowing. We know of the vision quest of the audacity of Eve, Gilgamesh, Pandora, Faust, Icarus, the Magi and the founders of the worlds great religions. The Biblical Nicodemus, irresolute and faltering finally dares the forbidding night goes out and meets Jesus, And the Prince Siddartha abandons royal privilege and discovers a timeless teaching of unparalleled wisdom and sophistication.
Prof. John Wesley Cook, my Professor at Yale, once said. Art is perceived through ecstasy whore mans sensibilities are stretched to the realization of a mystical reality. Beyond our material seeing is an aesthetic dimension through which we dare and dream. There is no human activity as pervasive as inspiring or as permanent as the artistic enterprise as it translates vision and transforms matter into another reality.
Rational constraints
There is a galaxy within us. an unpredictable mysterious portion of our being beyond the constraints of what is rational, and reasonable that has through thousands of years surprised us with fugitive and enduring expressions of anguish and celebration. Each constituent in the arts, each line, space, colour and form, each sound silence and rhythmic pattern, each gesture and mood is an individual expression from a collective consciousness.
This is the unique talent of art that it is empowered to express through one voice the feelings of the human race. Maya or illusion is the means of art just as religions are a way to the attainment of liberation. Art may be described as an irrational order of reality, a mirror of the constantly changing ethos of the world and its people.
The forms and moods of art penetrate are consciousness offering a rapture beyond are ordered and the limited score of knowledge. One cannot define or describe the transient power of impressions and emotions. One needs to discover them to know their fine. I do believe in the limitless potential of the human spirit How else could we have inherited the world's glorious legacy of artistic adventure that is the product of the restless questing spirit of man
Some of the greatest artistic expressions have grown out of discontent, and uncertainty, some out of hope and renewal. These are the eternal icons of the human race evidence of its pain and celebration. The artist described as a moderate fanatic lives beyond himself, creating forms that are meaningful entities that have developed into aesthetic systems of ideas expressing personal and social needs, Each historical style creates its particular forms often serving the needs _of religion, politics and power.
Vitality and diversity
In this amazing 20th century the might of protest, denial and the rejection of the hackneyed and familiar have produced a vitality and diversity, that are amazing. We now have a vast range of unfamiliar and extraordinary icons that challenge, both the eye and the spirit. Paul Cezanne, the great genius of this century. has said, to paint is not merely to copy but to seize a harmony between numerous tensions.
Imitation, whether crafty or reckless, romantic interpretation or sentimental or intellectual exaggeration. do not constitute value or truth in art and sensation alone as the Impressionists discovered is scattered and confused because a focus and a sense of order are required to create a truthful image from a truthful experience. The ideas, resonances, metaphors and the rhythms of inspired experiences create deathless icons that return ceaselessly to revive and exalt the fragile and uncertain spirit.
Art, of both place and period, survives as a witness to its truth. Art is an act of faith and commission an act of empowerment without alternatives. Wherever it originates or whatever it expresses its real value and purpose as it climbs threads of the imagination is to evolve new strategies and skills and to reveal a new window of eye and ear.
This is an endless and provocative subject but while they are visually vastly different the inner correspondences have the same objective goals. In both East and West, the artist sees what he wants to see so his icons are personal, intentional and cultural manifestations of his time and space.
The west obsessed with progress has undergone complex and manifold changes in creative activity in the last 50 or more years, surprising the world with its new attitudes and vibrant new languages. The earlier tyranny of traditions and formal structures have been replaced by compelling new concepts, emotions and manifestations. It is true to say that the 20th century has made a new judgment of the universe. The East dominated for centuries by Western colonial powers remained resistant to change in its artistic attitudes and expressions, The arts of the East are largely sacred serving with unchanging forms the religious needs of its peoples.
Unquestioning belief
The iconographical rules of eastern sacred art are changeless, the belief is that they have been divinely instructed. There is an unquestioning Tibetan belief that since magic power pervades the earth, it is mandatory that sacred architecture must correspond to the lines and movements of that magic force.
The SADHANAS are strict iconographical rules outside of which no sacred image may be made because the East believes that the sacred image is granted by the numinous world.
In the Temple of Man in Luxor in ancient Egypt, there is a hieroglyph of BA, a Bird. Like all picture writing BA is austerely drawn with a fine economy of line and colour, precise and eloquent in its purpose and intention. The bird is a symbol of varied movement as it walks, runs, swims and flies. BA is not just a Bird but the essence of a bird, BA symbolizes the need to escape from the limiting conditions of life to escape to search for the miraculous and the unknown. This is also the purpose of Art in all its forms.

ROYAL WEDDING A BOOST FOR BRITAIN
UK: The royal wedding of Prince Harry and his glamorous fiancee Meghan Markle is a moment of light relief for a Britain weighed down by political, social and economic woes.
With growth shrinking and the government riven over Brexit, Saturdays wedding is set to provide a national boost and give people an excuse to party.
Around 100,000 people are expected to pack the streets of Windsor, west of London, to join in the festive atmosphere and get a glimpse of the newlyweds carriage winding through the town.
Some 2,640 people have been invited inside the Windsor Castle grounds for a closer look -- among them Rashid Bhayat.
It certainly could be a moment of national unity. It is a real opportunity for the country to celebrate, the youth inclusion charity chief told AFP. The wedding in St Georges Chapel at Windsor Castle brings together Queen Elizabeth IIs grandson, who is sixth in line to the throne, and US former actress Markle, who at 36 is three years his senior. The dress and the wedding rings are a closely-guarded secret, as is Harrys uniform and whether he will be given a new title.
The service starts at midday (1100 GMT), with the newlyweds emerging to pose on the chapel steps at 1:00 pm (1200 GMT) before a 25-minute carriage ride through Windsor town. Queen Elizabeth is then giving a reception for the 600 guests in the castles St. Georges Hall. In the evening, Harrys father Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, is hosting a private reception for 200 family and close friends at nearby Frogmore House.
Even the palace are promising fun and surprises so hopefully were all going to have a big smile on our face and well be toasting this royal romance of the year, royal biographer Andrew Morton, told AFP. What youre going to see is the symbolic union of the special relationship, of America and Britain. The same cannot be said of Markles own family.
Her older half-brother Tom and half-sister Samantha have not been invited.
Tom wrote an extraordinary open letter to Harry on April 26, saying TV fame had made his half-sister a jaded, shallow, conceited woman that will make a joke of you.
Markles father, who had been due to walk his daughter up the aisle, may also be a no show.
According to celebrity news website TMZ, Thomas Markle, who recently caused a furor by posing for paparazzi photos, has pulled out of accompanying his daughter down the aisle at Windsor Castle because he does not want to embarrass her.
Kensington Palace did not confirm the report but pleaded for understanding and respect for the couple during a difficult situation. Politicians are also off the guest list, so US President Donald Trump and British Prime Minister Theresa May will not be attending.
It will be a chance for the British public to leave behind temporarily the deep divisions that have emerged over Britains future outside the European Union. It could also bring a welcome boost to the economy. The royal wedding commemorative china has already gone on sale, while stamps and a special 5 coin have been issued featuring the couple.
Besides the official souvenirs, Windsor shops are stuffed with mugs, bookmarks, tea towels, postcards, British flags, face masks and cardboard cut-outs as the town cashes in on its big day. Traditional street parties will be held around the kingdom. Market research firm Mintel, which surveyed 2,000 people online, reported that a third of Britons said the wedding made them feel more proud to be British. - AFP
Many U.K. businesses are capitalizing on Prince Harry and Meghan Markles wedding.

Saga of a lady eminence
The Sinhala film that bears the title Bimbadevi or Yasodhara happens to be a work which embraces a long list of research source both prose and verse as well as folk and classical linked into the mainstream of religious visions of Buddhist thought. Director Professor Sunil Ariyaratne, along with producer H D Premasiri, has taken pains to trace the most significant resource material that enables a spectator to hunt more of the same.
Whether the film Yasodhara is received by the spectator or not is not the question I asked myself when I came out of the auditorium. I was drawn towards going down the memory lane where I first encountered the ballad titled Yasodharavatha or the versified profile of Yasodhara the queen consort of Siddhartha, the would be Buddha. She is portrayed in the versification, not as a sentimental lamenting female, instead a tranquilised individual who tries to feel the reality.
The feeling makes her say:
Karanava buduvenava lakunu dene
Nera patuva ava ma sarana gene
As I saw signs in you who is destined attain the Buddhahood, I traversed all the way in the cycle of births taking your hand.
This, I feel, is the sense that the creator of the Sinhala film intends to pinpoint. I feel that the work Yasodharavatha of anonymous authorship still remains uninterpreted in the real sense of a vision.
Yasodhara, although physically alone or isolated with the newborn, Rahula, nevertheless feels within herself the impermanence that her husband Siddhartha perceived just before his great renunciation. On further analysis taking some other poems, a reader may feel that the work is just not a mere sentimental versification of a woman who yearns to see her deported husband. The visual creator Sunil Ariyaratne had been quite careful in the enveloping of a selected number of verses without reaching a verve of sentimental mood. He also uses the Pali Narasimha Gathas or stanzas that express the physical as well as the spiritual qualities of the Buddha, in order to transfer her feelings to her growing son his father walks past the palace. Perhaps as I see, the Sinhala versification of Yasodharavata may have been inspired by those stanzas.
As for me both the Narasiha Gatha as well as Yasodhara Vata are high grade sensitive and spiritual metaphysical poems which influenced the poets of the generations that followed. But some of the poets of the Colombo School of Poets located the pulse of sensitivity embedded.
One such work of B H Amarasena of Hikkaduwa is titled Yasodharava. In this work, the reader comes across a lamenting lady.
Pera pera kandulu kiridaruveku atin dara
Perada nogos pembara mav piyan kara
Holding an infant and shedding tears incessantly, I [Yasodhara] have not gone to see my parents.
This reaches the climax when the poet makes the persona, Yasodhara whether he did tit for tat. The two Yasodhara portrayals are poles apart. The average Sinhala poetry reader may not receive the portrayal of Amarasenas Yasodhara. But the former portrayal by the ballad creator left anonymous reaches a higher pedestal from a visionary point of view. Around the late sixties, I came across a Hindu poetic work titled as Yasodha. Composed by a poet named Maithri Saranagupta, the book was lying in my friend and wellwisher Venerable Siyambalagaharuppe Vijithadhamma Thera, a monk well versed in Sanskrit and Hindi.
I was made to know that this work was partly translated by the well known Buddhist scholar Venerable Professor Bambarende Siri Seevali Thera at the request of his friend, the well known Colombo poet P B Alwis Perera. Furthermore, I came to know that some of the translated poems were published in the monthly poetry magazine edited by the poet titled as Dedunna. Though I remember reading a few of those translated poems as published in the magazine, I failed to grasp the essence of the complete work as created by the original poet Maithri Saranagupta. Venerable Vijithadahamma Thera tells that the Hindi composition had a great resemblance to the Sinhala folk ballad version Yasodharavatha. Followed by all these versifications, I found the English narrative by the writer Edmund Barrett titled as Lady of the Lotus.
I had a copy of the book bought from a bookstall in London. I was just amazed to see the portrayal of the character Yasodhara just as I sensed in the already cited versified folk version that I read as a schoolgoer. I tried to trace more about the creative process of the English writer, but it was a failed mission.
Having returned to Sri Lanka I had the opportunity to discuss the narrative with a lady journalist who borrowed my copy. Sorry to say she never returned it. I was informed later that a Sinhalese translation has appeared. I have not had any access to that book as yet. I still yearn to get a copy of The Lady of the Lotus.
Perhaps on second thoughts, I felt that that the wandering minstrel (Tumindu Dodantenna) is used in order to link these sources. But I am not sure if the mission of that character had any impact. At least four Sinhala novels have been written on the theme of the great renunciation of Prince Siddhartha.
Pandit Vimal Abhayasundara did a radio opera titled Yasodhara. The text of the opera was published in one of his collections later on.
The feeling that the great renunciation is just not an escapism is stressed in the original Pali source as found in Mahavagga Pali. It is the highest ideal of letting off of al material wealth inclusive of lay life that culminates in the last Jataka narrative of Vessantara Jatakaya. At least we are made to feel the words of the Buddha.
May you develop mental concentration
for whosoever is mentally concentrated
Sees things according to reality.

School vans to increase charges
School vans drivers will increase transport charges by eight to ten percent, after the recent fuel price hike.
The proposed increase will come into effect from June, Secretary to the All Ceylon Inter District School Van Drivers Association, Kithsiri Amarasinghe told the Daily News in Kurunegala yesterday.
He said the cost of spare parts, salaries of employees and parking fees too have gone up and hence this increase of transport charges is reasonables. There are about 15,000 registered members in their association and the total number of school vans countrywide is around 22,000. Despite obstacles, we try our best to offer safe transport service to the school student population of this country, he added.

Scoring countrys maiden Test century  OBrien  joins select band
Kevin O'Brien was the toast of IRELAND when he marked his countrys debut Test with their maiden three-figure score at this level against Pakistan at Dublin on Monday. By doing so OBrien joined a select band of three cricketers who had done so before him  that is to score a century in their countries first-ever Test match.
Test cricket didnt have to wait too long for the first century when in the first-ever Test match played between AUSTRALIA and England at Melbourne in 1877, English-born Australian Charles Bannerman not only faced the first ball of the inaugural Test and scored the first runs but before the end of the first day reached three figures. He finished with 165 before retiring hurt with a split hand. Australia made only 245 in their first innings and Bannermans percentage of the overall total (67.3%) remains a Test record. Australia went onto win the Test by 45 runs.
It took another 115 years before someone emulated Bannermans feat when 35-year-old captain David Houghton scored 121 in ZIMBABWES inaugural Test against India at Harare in October 1992. His innings ensured Zimbabwe became the first team to avoid defeat in its inaugural Test match since Australia in 1877.
Eight years later Aminul Islam joined the unique list by scoring a splendid 145 in 535 minutes to launch BANGLADESHS entry into Test cricket against India at Dhaka in November 2000. Bangladesh flourished with Islams contribution to run up 400 in their first innings but sadly after this fine beginning they collapsed for 91 in their second innings to hand to India a comfortable win by nine wickets  it was a scenario that has become depressingly familiar with Bangladesh cricket ever since.
ENGLANDS first century came in their fourth Test overall when WG Grace made a superb 152 to set up a winning total of 420 against Australia at the Oval in 1880.
SOUTH AFRICA although being one of the three founder members of the Imperial Cricket Conference (now International Cricket Council) in 1909 - the international governing body for cricket - were a very weak side in their early days and it wasnt until their seventh Test that anyone managed even a half-century. That honour went to Jimmy Sinclair who in the next Test went one better by scoring 106 against England at Cape Town in 1899. His fine knock however couldnt stop South Africa from suffering their eighth consecutive Test defeat. Sinclair in fact made South Africas first three Test hundreds before anyone else got in on the act.
Trinidad opener Clifford Roach became the first Test centurion for WEST INDIES in their fourth Test scoring 122 against England at Bridgetown, Barbados in January 1930. It was his first century in first-class cricket as well. With Roach following that innings with 77 and George Headley hitting a classic 176 in the second innings West Indies managed to draw the Test.
During the West Indies series England were concurrently involved in another series with NEW ZEALAND as well. In New Zealands second Test played at Wellington, Stewie Dempster made his countrys first Test century scoring 136 in an opening stand of 276 with Jackie Mills who reached his own hundred not long after his partner. The Test was drawn with Dempster scoring an undefeated 80 in the second innings.
To The stormy petrel of INDIAN cricket Lala Amarnath went the honour of scoring his countrys maiden Test hundred. A fine all-rounder who later captained them Amarnath hit a valiant 118 against England at the Bombay Gymkhana in December 1933 in his countrys second Test and the first played at home. It was the first Test match to include Sunday play. India however lost by nine wickets.
Following a heavy defeat in their inaugural Test against India at Delhi in October 1952, PAKISTAN needed something special to restore their pride in the second at Lucknow (played on jute matting). It was provided by their opener Nazar Mohammad who batted throughout Pakistans 515-minute innings for 124 not out and became the first player to be on the field for an entire Test match. With Fazal Mahmood capturing a dozen wickets Pakistan turned tables on their arch rivals leveling the series with an innings win.
It took almost 30 years before another country joined the first Test century club. When SRI LANKA finally gained Test status in 1981 they wasted no time in making their mark when in their third official Test against Pakistan at Faisalabad in March 1982, stylish opener Sidath Wettimuny became the first player to bat throughout a complete days play and shared in his countrys first century partnership with Roy Dias (98). Wettimuny who finished day one on 143 ended up with 157. The Test ended in a draw with Pakistan struggling to stave off defeat at 186-7 after being set 339 for victory in a minimum of 330 minutes.
Ireland and Afghanistan were elevated to full membership status at the ICC meeting in London in June 2017 making them the 11th and 12th countries to play Test cricket. Ireland has already made their mark with OBrien making it a memorable one for his country by scoring their maiden Test century.
Afghanistan is due to make their Test debut against India at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium in Bengalaru from June 14-18. Can they make it a memorable beginning for them as it has for Ireland

Senior DIG - D.W.R.B. Seneviratne appointed Acting FCID Head
Based on service requirement, until a new Senior DIG is appointed to the post, Inspector General of Police Pujith Jayasundara has appointed Senior DIG - D.W.R.B. Seneviratne as the Acting Head of the FCID, Police Media Spokesman SP Ruwan Gunasekara said.
Financial Crimes Investigations Division (FCID) Head Ravi Waidyalankara left the Police department on Monday having reached the mandatory retirement age of 60.
IGP Pujith Jayasundara had earlier requested the Police Commission last month to accept Waidyalankaras retirement as there was no provision to grant him an extension. The senior DIG was under investigation by the Special Investigation Unit and the Bribery Commission (CIABOC), it is reported.
Waidyalankara had submitted his retirement papers last month, but there were moves to grant him an extension.
According to reliable sources, the next senior most DIG is Kandy DIG Mahinda Ekanayake. However, he is due to retire in a months time and measures will be taken to re-employ Ravi Waidyalankara on contract basis to head the FCID thereafter.
It is also learned that a Cabinet paper has been submitted seeking approval to employ Waidyalankara on contract basis.

Shortage of 2018 school textbooks - CTU
A severe shortage of text books is visible for 2018 with only 28,210,600 text books were printed, while the total requirement is at 41,189,027, the Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) said.
The CTU issuing a press release stated that the teachers too are affected by the situation as the number of textbooks needed for the teachers has not been included in the printed textbooks.
Of the 28,210,600 books printed, the students from Grades 1 to 4 need 8,802,100 books, while students of Grade 9 need 6,432,000 and 2,630,000 workbooks must be compulsorily printed. But only a small number of the requireent is printed, the press release stated.
The statement further stated that printing a lesser number of textbooks on the basis of re-use is problematic when Rs 4,385 million is allocated from the budget for textbook printing. The announcement also stated that calling for tenders of the Educational Publications Department for reprinting 2018 textbooks in January is a joke.

## Title: Should the ban on Glyphosate continue unhindered
## Supertitle:

Should the ban on Glyphosate continue unhindered
As the former head of the Rubber Research Institute(RRI), having seen the production figures of both Tea, Rubber and Coconut in the Central Bank report, I was shocked to notice that the Rubber production in the country has dropped down to 69,000 Mt during 2016, compared to over 130,000 Mt produced before 2015, pushing Sri Lanka down to the 12th position among NR producing countries. Situation with regard to other plantation crops including paddy is also the same. Our national rubber productivity has dropped to just over 800Kg/Ha/Yr from 1,300 Kg produced per hectare four years ago. One of the main reasons for this low productivity is the non-availability of the weedicide in order to minimize fertilizer wastage in farm lands and the high cost of fertilizer compared to before 2015.
Sri Lanka had a small population half a century ago and the agricultural crops, particularly rice utilized cow dung as the fertilizer and the spraying of extract of Neem leaves or tobacco leaves was sufficient to control the pests. But, the yields were very low and were sufficient to feed the low population in the country few decades ago. Today the availability of farm lands in the whole world, particularly in Sri Lanka has dwindled and hence use of modern techniques to achieve at least four fold increases in productivity of agricultural lands is essential.
In Sri Lanka, a sizable amount of foreign exchange earned in the country was used prior to 1977 to import rice to feed the population. Thanks to the diversion of Mahaweli River was undertaken on priority basis to irrigate cultivable land in the dry zone to increase rice production. The use of modern techniques and high yielding rice varieties developed in the world helped us to be self-sufficient in rice until 2016.
The developed countries in the world including US produced weedicides like Glyphosate and even the use of genetically modified (GM) high yielding crops to meet the food requirement for the ever increasing human population all over the world. Monsanto Company has developed this weedicide to control weeds in their soya bean farms in mid nineteen sixties to supply Soya bean products to the whole world including to Sri Lanka. However until now, no complaints have been made by the soya bean product consumers in the world of any health related problems such as chronic kidney disease (CKDu) or other ailments caused by the chemical or its residues.
Plantation sector
Major users of Glyphosate in Sri Lanka are the people working in tea plantations in the hill country and mid country; among them number of CKDu cases reported is insignificant. Further, the Chena cultivators in the North Central province hardly use weedicides and among them CKDu has become an acute problem.
Until 2015 in all agricultural and plantation crops in the country, the accepted method of weed control was the application of Glyphosate available in few reputed trade names. Unlike in the case of pesticides used widely for insect control, it must be stated that I have not come across any accidental deaths or suicides reported due to consuming Glyphosate, during my career. But, there are few other weed controlling chemicals still used in the plantation sector are extremely injurious to human health and they are widely used by plantation workers for suicidal purposes. It must also be emphasized here that, even the substitute used now for weed control after banning Glyphosate is far more toxic than Glyphosate.
Further, even though it is not so toxic, during the application of Glyphosate, all precautions are taken to prevent any possible effects to the farmers caused due to inhalation of the vapour or skin contact. Glyphosate is the weedicide introduced by US over three decades ago to control weeds in Soya bean farms owned by them, to cater to the whole world.
Glyphosate is a systemic weedicide completely killing weeds other than soya been plants from the roots up to the leaves within 8 to 10 days after application; unlike surface weedicides, which kills all green plants soon after application; but grow again within few days, sprouting from the root stock left alive underneath. The sad scenario is that some scientists without much experience and sufficient exposure to agriculture had created an unfounded fear among the public that the cause for the chronic kidney disease (CKDu) spreading in certain provinces in the dry zone of Sri Lanka is the Glyphosate residue accumulated in tanks and reservoirs which are consumed by the people through fresh water fish, vegetables and water. I am sure that none of them have done a survey for the presence of cadmium (Cd) which is a known potential toxic chemical causing kidney disease; present in large quantities in tank water used for drinking by the people living in CKDu affected areas.
Cadmium accumulated by grass contaminates milk and also cow dung commonly used by farmers as a fertilizer for fruit and vegetable crops. Hence it is very wrong for them to have mislead politicians who are mostly not knowledgeable in scientific subjects to bring in policies like banning the use of Glyphosate in agriculture in the country, thereby making the situation worse for plantations and small scale farmers. Today, you cannot find workers to do sundry work either in plantations or even in farm lands in most remote villages and Glyphosate as a substitute for labour has rendered an invaluable contribution.
Bio rice and Bio vegetables
Recent, wage increase of workers have made the situation even worse for both plantations and farmers, when the price of fertilizers in the market has gone up by over 100%. As an alternative to increased fertilizer price and with the aim of producing health safe Bio rice and Bio vegetables, now, there is a plan to cultivate several thousand acres of paddy lands in the forth-coming planting season using only organic fertilizers (Compost). I only hope that those who give de-ropes to politicians are at least aware of the quantity of compost needed to replace a kilogram of urea or MOP used in a farm
Where are they going to manufacture compost in Sri Lanka and out of what Are they aware that the compost made out of city garbage was not recommended by research institutes due to the presence of high level of lead in them Can such high lead containing compost be added to crops like paddy and vegetables Hence, before making recommendations to policy makers, they must be sure of what they say and should have solid experimental data to prove their recommendations. They must also be sure of the possible yields of such bio farms fed with only compost fertilizer and with manual weeding.
Already, the ban of Glyphosate weedicide has created a series of problems in small farms as well as in plantations. From my own experience, manual weeding will only increase the cost of production of agricultural crops; also growth of weeds vastly reduces the fertilizer efficiency of farms due to the absorption of added nutrients to the soil by the weeds.
In a comprehensive review published by Prof Chandra Dharmawardene in CDN paper dated 19th April, has given a full report of health effects of glyphosate. Ina similar scientific article published some time ago by Prof Deepal Mathew of Colombo Medical Faculty, has shown by means of the LD50 values that common salt is more toxic to mammals than Glyphosate.
Similarly, WHO has done a survey and reported that the use of glyphosate in agriculture is safer than the use of Kerosene oil in domestic lighting in the country. Further, WHO has reported that in order to intoxicate a person at least 8 table spoons of glyphosate containing 40mg per liter of the active ingredient must be consumed. That shows that even the extra precautions taken by the farmers in spraying glyphosate is not essential as the amount of active ingredient in the diluted solution is very little.
Taking these things into consideration, the European government has decided to extend the approval granted to use glyphosate in food crop farming until sufficient scientifically proven facts are evident against the use of it. It is my considered opinion that the banning of glyphosate by the government is an illogical and pre-mature judgment taken at the expense of the economy. In scientific articles, it has been reported that cadmium metal in drinking water definitely affect kidneys of those who use contaminated water and hence the public in the NCP of Sri Lanka must be aware of this fact. When the WHO carried out a health survey in Sri Lanka jointly with local doctors, they have observed high levels of cadmium in the urine of the CKD affected patients. If that is the case, sources of high cadmium containing precursors must be banned in Sri Lanka. If this is the case, can the government recommend the use of Eppawala Rock Phosphate (ERP) containing 25 ppm of Cadmium in fertilizer mixtures
scientific facts
Hence, taking these scientific facts into consideration, why not educated politicians and ministers with scientific back ground and advise the President and the Prime Minister to remove the ban on the use of Glyphosate in all sectors of agriculture in Sri Lanka, at least to reach our crop productivity figures reported before 2015 level to save the country from a mass hunger if, a world war erupt in the future.
Policymakers should not blindly get carried away by the half-baked scientific facts given by the scientists inexperienced in agriculture backed by the cheap publicity seeking politicians about these chemicals which are essential for the food and industrial raw material production of the country. By way of a reply to Ranasinghes article, finally I must say that the Rubber Plantation sector too had a devastating impact as a result of the ban of the Glyphosate and the low productivity is one of the banes of this ill-conceived ban.

Sierra Readymix was adjudged as one of the Top 10 Best Practices in the World at the 5th International Best Practice Competition held in Mumbai, India.
The Company won this prestigious position for its CSR initiative done in collaboration with SIRASA TV GammeddaProgramme to construct a series of buildings at the Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam and install a solar power generation system at the premises in order to provide a cost-efficient and a green energy solution to the school.
Sierra Readymix previously won a place amongst the top 23 at the International Best Practice Awards held in the Philippines for its pioneering practice of Waste Process Water Reduction, Grout Accumulation Reduction and Precast Reutilization, in its efforts to minimize the environmental impact of current industry practices.
L . C. Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager said, There is much to be done in terms of assisting this particular school as well as other schools in the area.
However, we were happy to set precedence in supporting the community in the area, in particular the future generation who will one day join the driving force behind our country.
Sierra Readymix built five class rooms, a multipurpose building, a theatre along with a dressing room and a movable classroom that can double as a main conference hall at the school premises. The solar power system installed at the school premises today provides electricity to the school.
Mune Sinhala Vidyalaya in Kandakuliya, Puttalam facilitates around 400 students from grade 1  9. The school lacked even the basic infrastructure, compelling a large number of students to attend classes in the shade of a tree.
Having identified this crucial requirement, Sierra Readymix stepped forward to provide assistance and succeeded in constructing the multi-purpose building within a months time as discussed with the students and parents.
D.N.N. Lokuge, Chairman, Sierra Readymix and L. C. Weerasinghe, Director/General Manager, Sierra Readymix were instrumental in carrying out the entire project to complete construction of the series of buildings and installing the solar power system.

Sri Lanka celebrates World Metrology Day on May 25
The Measurement Units, Standards and Services Department (MUSSD) will celebrate this years World Metrology Day on May 25 to commemorate the anniversary of the signing of the Meter Convention on May 20,1875.
The Meter Convention provides the basis for a universal measurement system, which lays the platform for scientific discovery and innovation, industrial manufacturing, and trade as well as socioeconomic and environmental development.
The overarching theme of World Metrology Day 2018 is the constant evolution of the international system of units (SI). At the General Conference on Weights and Measures in November 2018, a substantial change to the SI based on new measurement methods using quantum phenomena is expected to be introduced. In support of MUSSD, the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO) and Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt (PTB) are co-hosting a series of commemorative events within the framework of the EU-Sri Lanka Trade-related Assistance project, funded by the European Union.
World Metrology Day will commence with a symposium on May 25 at MUSSDs main auditorium in Homagama featuring a meteorologist from the Korea Research Institute of Standards and Science (KRISS).

Toxin free farming necessary for a healthy nation - TFNFN Secretary
Toxin Free National Farmer Network (TFNFN) yesterday urged the government not to reverse the toxin free farming successfully practiced by more than five thousand farmers during past two three years.
Addressing the media yesterday at the Strategic Enterprise Management Agency (SEMA), TFNFN Secretary S. K. Subasinghe said that most of the farmers those who are engaged in toxin free farming had to be converted in to the chemical farming method due to the re-implementation of the fertilizer subsidy.
Though the government decided to grant a subsidy for the farmers who engage in toxin free farming, that decision has remained at discussion level for a long period. So, most of the farmers have converted in to chemical farming method as they have no other choice.
He stressed the importance of granting the proposed subsidy for toxin free farming without any delay, in order to encourage farmers those who engage in toxin free farming with the intention of creating a healthy nation.
He further added that the new Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has also recommended the toxin free farming by converting his paddy field in to an organic paddy field.
Addressing the occasion, TFNFN Chairman Priyantha Pathirana charged that the Ministers those who submitted the cabinet paper asking to remove the ban on phosphate, have fulfilled the requirement of chemical companies.
"Both of them are dreaming to be the President of the country by putting the entire nation in to danger," Pathirana further charged.

The two-pizza rule and the secret of Amazons success
Jeff Bezoss firm is good at selling things to shoppers, but that is the tip of its commercial iceberg
In the early days of Amazon, Jeff Bezos instituted a rule: every internal team should be small enough that it can be fed with two pizzas. The goal wasnt to cut down on the catering bill. It was, like almost everything Amazon does, focused on two aims: efficiency and scalability. The former is obvious. A smaller team spends less time managing timetables and keeping people up to date, and more time doing what needs to be done. But its the latter that really matters for Amazon.
The thing about having lots of small teams is that they all need to be able to work together, and to be able to access the common resources of the company, in order to achieve their larger goals.
Thats what turns the company into, in the words of Benedict Evans, of venture capital firm Andreessen Horowitz, a machine that makes the machine.
You can add new product lines without adding new internal structure or direct reports, and you can add them without meetings and projects and process in the logistics and e-commerce platforms, Evans notes. You dont need to fly to Seattle and schedule a bunch of meetings to get people to implement support for launching makeup in Italy, or persuade anyone to add things to their roadmap.
Amazon is good at being an e-commerce company that sells things, but what its great at is making new e-commerce companies that sell new things.
The company calls this approach its flywheel: it takes the scale that can smother a typical multinational, and uses it to provide an ever-increasing momentum backing up its entire business. The faster the flywheel spins, and the heavier it is, the harder it is for anyone else to stop it.
Perhaps the best example of that approach in action is the birth and growth of AWS (previously called Amazon Web Services). Thats the division of Amazon that provides cloud computing services, both internally and for other companies  including those that are competitors to Amazon in other areas (both Netflix and Tesco use the platform, for instance, despite Amazon also selling streaming video and groceries).
It started, like so many things at Amazon, with an edict from the top. Every team, Bezos ordered, should begin to work with each other only in a structured, systematic way. If an advertising team needed some data on shoe sales to decide how best to spend their resources, they could not email analytics and ask for it; they needed to go to the analytics dashboard themselves and get it. If that dashboard didnt exist, it needed to be created. And that approach needed to cover everything.
From there, it was almost an afterthought to take the obvious next step, and let others use the same technology that Amazon made available internally.
Those humble beginnings spawned a beast. The business is now 10% of Amazons overall revenue, making so much money that financial regulations forced the company to report it as a top-level division in its own right: Amazon divides its company into US and Canada, International, and AWS.
AWS is large enough that it is dealt with on the same tier as the entire rest of the world. AWS is large enough that Netflix, a company that accounts for around a third of all internet traffic in North America, is just another customer.
AWS is large enough that in 2016 the company released the Snowmobile, a literal truck for moving data. The companies that work with AWS move so much information around that sometimes the internet simply cannot cope. So now, if you want to upload a lot of data to Amazons cloud, the company will drive a truck to your office, fill it with data, then drive it back. If you need to upload 100 petabytes  thats roughly 5m movies in 4k with surround sound  it turns out theres no quicker way to do it than driving it down the freeway at 75mph.
While AWS saw Amazon open up its internal technology to external customers, another part of the company does the same trick with Amazons actual website. - The Guardian

## Title: Two simple habits of non-procrastinators
## Supertitle: 
## Section: T&C
## Date: Wednesday, May 16, 2018 - 01:00
Two simple habits of non-procrastinators
Its pretty rare to find people who (almost) never procrastinate  in my experience, 95-99% of people procrastinate, at least part of each day. If not most of the day!
Thats not a judgment  I procrastinate too. Its about understanding our habitual reactions to stress, uncertainty, difficult tasks, being overwhelmed, distractions and more. Most of us procrastinate, based on habits we formed as kids and teenagers.
But some people rarely procrastinate. Its like finding a unicorn  they are beautiful and a little unbelievable! So when I find one, I interview them.
Heres what Ive found two habits of non-procrastinators are (and theyre habits I try to practice most of the time), plus a bonus habit that Ive found to be useful:
Compassion for future self: This is the main one Ive found to be true in non-procrastinators, and most of them do it without really thinking about it! They think about what would make their future selves happiest, or have the least amount of pain. Then they do that action. So simple right Ha!
Making the steps small & doable: This is a fairly common tip, but combined with the above habit, its a powerful one-two punch. Take any difficult task and make it smaller, easier, more doable.
Bonus: fully open to the task: This is something Ive added, that not every non-procrastinator does  but it works wonders. Instead of closing ourselves to the task, instead of wanting it to be over, you can open up to the task fully.
Lets look at each of these in a little more detail.
Compassion for Future Self
Youve heard this one before, but its worth thinking about again. One of my favorite meditation teachers wrote about this the other day, and I wanted to explore it a little bit.
I think non-procrastinators formed this habit when they were in elementary school, and dont even realize theyre doing it much of the time. Something happened when they were young  maybe they turned something in late because they procrastinated, or they had to do it last-minute and really hated it  but they learned that putting things off equals future pain.
So instead, they have a mental habit of thinking:
If I put this off, it will just be more trouble for me in the future; or
If I do this now, I will be happier in the future; so therefore
I should just get it over with and do it now.
So simple, and yet this must be ingrained as a habit. Instead, most people have a habit of thinking:
I can do this later, its not a problem, I would rather do something else right now; or
I want to get away from this pain right now, Id rather put it off and relieve my stress with comfort food/distraction/etc.
Therefore, Internet!
Its such a strongly ingrained habit that we dont even think about it.
To change the habit, pause and be more deliberate. Think about your future self, tomorrow or a year from now. What action taken today, and repeatedly, would make this future self happier How can you be compassion with this future self, so that they dont have to suffer
Practice it and make it a habit. Its simple, but again, combine it with the next habit, and youll see the power of this method.
The above habit is simple and perhaps a bit obvious to people who have read it before. And so is this habit. But most people dont realize how powerful it is to combine these two habits into one method. In fact, I believe most non-procrastinators do these two habits in combination, without realizing it.
The habit really is this: make the task seem so doable that starting it will be easy. Once youve started, youre in. Youre already moving, so you just keep moving. So the key is to get moving in the first place, and you do that by making it seem really easy to start. You kind of trick your present self into starting so that your future self will be happier. But its not really a trick, as it really can be easy to start, but we build the task up in our minds into something so hard and painful that we put it off. If we just start, well see that its not so bad.
So when youre contemplating a task or project, make it a habit of thinking about how easy it will be to start. Want to write a book chapter Dont think about how hard it will be to write a chapter for 3-4 hours, or how many things you need to figure out before you can write the chapter. Instead, just think about opening a simple word processor, playing some nice music, and writing the first thing that comes to your mind. Easy, doable, small. Just think about how easy it is to start, dont think about the whole thing. The truth is, you cant do the whole thing, not at once  all you can do is the next simple step. Focus on that.
Combine these two things and see what happens. Empathize with your future self, and then just think about the smallest possible way to start. Be just like a non-procrastinator!
Bonus: Fully Open to the Task
The last habit is something Ive found to add a lot to this method, even if not every non-procrastinator practices it. It takes a little more awareness/mindfulness than most habits.
Its about how we normally want to either 1) get away from a task because its hard or filled with uncertainty, or 2) get the task over with (like its a chore), and move on to the next task, because we have a lot to do. The problem with this approach is that every task becomes some thing to get done with, something we dont like doing. Which means we spend our days filled with things we dont really like, and after awhile, this gets tiring, stressful, boring.
This leads to procrastination, because who wants to do tasks you dont really want to do
Instead, what if you fully opened up to the task, finding joy in the middle of it
Its about allowing yourself to be fully present with the task. For example:
Youre about to start writing (or some other similar task), so you get into the space, allowing yourself to arrive fully.
You look at the task full on, and notice if youre resisting, wanting to run, not liking it. You allow yourself to stay with the task, being compassionate for yourself but also your future self.
You find gratitude for being able to do the task, and connect it with the larger mission youre trying to serve, the people you care about.
In the middle of that gratitude and devotion to who and what you care about  you do the task, and find joy in the simple doing. Notice the difference between this kind of opening, and the way we usually try to just get things done, just get them over with. Its completely different.
Open up to the task, have compassion for your future self, and just focus on the smallest, most doable way to get started. See what that might change.

Vinces double century earns draw for Hants
LONDON, Monday: James Vince boosted his England selection chances by batting through the entire final day to guide Hampshire to a draw against Somerset at Taunton in their English County Championship match played at Taunton.
He scored 201 not out from 437 balls as the visitors went from 178-2 overnight to 432-4 when the game ended with Hashim Amla making 107.
Somerset, who were without the injured Jack Leach, took only two wickets on day four, but still claimed 13 points.
Vince began the day on 63 and he and Amla took their partnership to 194, with the South African reaching a 52nd first-class century before edging a short ball from Lewis Gregory to the keeper.
Vince was solid in defence, reining in his attacking instincts and offering just a few half-chances in his marathon innings. His 514-minute knock - the longest of his first-class career - earned Hampshire nine points and did his chances of selection to face Pakistan in Tests at Lord's on 24 May and Headingley on 1 June nothing but good.
Essex captain Ryan ten Doeschate said Australian bowler Peter Siddle made "one of the great overseas contributions" he has seen since he has been at the club. Paceman Siddle, 33, finished his four-game spell with 5-37 as Essex completed victory over Worcestershire.
Siddle took 20 wickets at an average of 16.10 in his four County Championship matches, with Essex's season-opener at Yorkshire abandoned without a ball being bowled because of a wet outfield. He has 62 Test caps but has not represented Australia in the five-day format since November 2016.
England paceman Mark Wood took a career-best 6-46 for Durham as their County Championship game against Derbyshire ended in a draw.
The 28-year-old, who is hoping to be named in England's squad for the first Test against Pakistan, bowled 22 overs on the final day, but his side were unable to force a win. Derbyshire had reached 279-9 in their second innings, a lead of 186, when the captains shook hands.
James Bracey hit an unbeaten century as Gloucestershire dug in to earn a draw against Middlesex at Lord's.
Resuming on 66-2, and trailing by 179, the visitors appeared set for their second defeat of 2018 on the final day. But Gareth Roderick's 48 helped them pass 150 before he was caught off James Harris (3-60) and Jack Taylor (41) and Bracey added 91 for the fourth wicket.
The 21-year-old reached 125 alongside Graeme van Buuren (46) before they declared on 326-4, ahead by 81 runs. The draw was the second of the season for both sides, and Middlesex are fifth in the table, with Gloucestershire seventh, as switch to for the start of the One-Day Cup.
Sam Curran took 10 wickets in a match for the first time as Surrey wrapped up victory over Yorkshire by an innings and 17 runs at The Oval.
The home side needed only 9.1 overs on the final morning to finish the job after Yorkshire resumed on 142-5. Rikki Clarke had Jonny Bairstow caught behind for 29 and the innings ended at 168 with Jack Leaning out for 28. In between, all-rounder Curran took three wickets in six balls to finish with 4-47 and match figures of 10-101.
The win was unbeaten Surrey's second of the season and earned them a maximum 24 points, lifting them to third in the Division One table, nine points behind leaders Notts, but with a game in hand.
