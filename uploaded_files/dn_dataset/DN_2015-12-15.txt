Star Wars mania at fever pitch before new film opens

US: A long time ago, in movie theaters around the world, a pop culture phenomenon was born.
Nearly 40 years after Star Wars first hit screens, excitement for next weeks release of the latest installment in the blockbuster space saga is reaching fever pitch.
Fans of Han Solo, Princess Leia and Luke Skywalker are counting the days, hours and minutes until they can see Star Wars: The Force Awakens, the continuation of the epic created by George Lucas.
Stars will hit the red carpet for the films world premiere in Los Angeles on Monday. The global roll-out will begin on Wednesday in France, Belgium and more than a dozen other countries before it officially hits US theaters Friday.
Star Wars has attracted generations of loyal fans ever since the first film arrived in 1997, introducing the world to The Force, Jedi knights, Darth Vader, Wookiees and two clever droids, R2-D2 and C3PO.
The intergalactic tale of good versus evil, friendship, loyalty and love created a defining moment in the history of popular culture and launched one of the biggest movie franchises ever.
The hype around the movie is such that 70 US super-fans are paying up to $5,000 to fly to Paris so they can see the film on Wednesday -- two days before most Americans will have a chance to do so.
Some are making the 18,000-kilometre (11,200-mile) round trip from Los Angeles in one day, taking a bus from Charles de Gaulle airport outside Paris to a nearby cinema to see the movie, before returning to the US the same evening.
Its so awesome to see all ages interacting with it in that enthusiastic way, Oscar-winning actress Lupita Nyongo, who joins the franchise using motion-capture technology to play pirate Maz Kanata, told AFP.

Arsenal go top, Perez late show ends Spurs run Arsenal go top, Perez late show ends Spurs run

LONDON, SUNDAY: Arsene Wenger said that Arsenal had enjoyed a perfect week after they won 2-0 at Aston Villa on Sunday to supplant Manchester City at the Premier League summit.
Arsenal reached the Champions League last 16 on Wednesday by winning 3-0 at Olympiakos, Olivier Giroud scoring all three goals, and the Frenchman set the London side on their way against Villa with an early penalty.
Aaron Ramsey doubled Arsenal's lead before half-time, starting and finishing a swift counter-attack, as Wenger's men leapfrogged both City and former leaders Leicester City, who host champions Chelsea on Monday.
It was a perfect week for us, Wenger told the BBC. We spent a lot of energy away in the Champions League on Wednesday, but found the resources to win again here today (Sunday), in another away match.
This season is so unpredictable that you just focus on yourself and try to play well in the next game. You know if you are consistent then you have a chance.
Arsenal's fans happiness at seeing their side go top was enhanced hours later when arch rivals Tottenham Hotspur's 14-game unbeaten run was ended by a 2-1 home defeat at the hands of Newcastle United.
Meanwhile, substitute Divock Origi scored a 96th-minute equaliser as Jurgen Klopp's Liverpool drew 2-2 at home to West Bromwich Albion.
At Villa Park, Giroud sent Brad Guzan the wrong way from the penalty spot in the eighth minute after Alan Hutton was penalised for holding back Theo Walcott, which gave the France striker his 50th Arsenal league goal.
Ramsey made it 2-0 seven minutes before half-time, tackling Idrissa Gueye in midfield and sparking a move that saw the ball pass from Walcott to Mesut Ozil, who squared the ball for the Welshman to roll home.
In keeping Villa at bay, Arsenal goalkeeper Petr Cech equalled former England international David James's Premier League record of 169 clean sheets.
Villa manager Remi Garde had been hoping to get one over his former mentor Wenger, who signed him as a player at Arsenal, but his team remain eight points adrift of safety at the foot of the table.
Arsenal went a point clear of City and Leicester and four points above fourth-place Manchester United, who lost 2-1 at Bournemouth on Saturday.
Tottenham would have moved above United had they beaten Newcastle, but they remain fifth, three points below the Champions League berths, after late goals from substitutes Aleksandar Mitrovic and Ayoze Perez took Steve McClaren's side out of the relegation zone at Norwich City's expense. Eric Dier's glancing header from Christian Eriksen's corner gave Spurs a 39th-minute lead, but Mitrovic poked home an equaliser two minutes after coming on as a 72nd-minute substitute before Perez squeezed a winner beneath Hugo Lloris in the third minute of added time.
We are very disappointed in the dressing room, said Spurs manager Mauricio Pochettino. This is our 16th league game and our second defeat. It is a bad feeling, but we need to work hard and look forward.
Newcastle manager McClaren said his side had answered the critics, but warned: We haven't turned the corner yet. We need more performances like that.
Newcastle had shown a marked improvement by beating Liverpool last weekend and Klopp's men needed a last-gasp intervention from Origi to avoid a second consecutive defeat against West Brom. Liverpool captain Jordan Henderson marked his first start since August with a 21st-minute opener, but Craig Dawson punished an error by goalkeeper Simon Mignolet to equalise on the half hour before Jonas Olsson headed the visitors in front in the 73rd minute from Chris Brunt's corner.
Liverpool centre-back Dejan Lovren had to be stretchered off with a nasty knee injury, but the eight minutes of injury time that ensued enabled Origi to rescue the hosts with a deflected 25-yard shot. We created chances, made a perfect goal, then conceded those two, said Klopp. But at the end I can live with it. This could prove to be a very special moment for us in the season to strike back against such a team.

BIG THREE back in golf as Woods wilts

PARIS, SUNDAY: A watershed year in golf saw the emergence of a new Big Three, filling the vacuum left by the fast-fading Tiger Woods.
Jordan Spieth, Jason Day and Rory McIlroy ended the year on the world rankings podium, in that order, and their rivalry is set to shine brightly in the new year.
Spieth, at just 22, is the youngest of the three and, for much of the year gone by, he was the story.
He won the Masters for his first major title in April and followed up by taking the US Open two months later. He then set sail for St Andrews with talk of the never-before achieved calendar-year Grand Slam starting to dominate sporting pages.
He came agonisingly close to becoming just the second player, after Ben Hogan in 1953, to win the first three majors of the year, but a bogey at the 17th, the Road Hole, saw him miss out by one stroke on a three-man playoff won by Zach Johnson.
Spieth then lost the world number one spot he had taken from McIlroy in June to the then 27-year-old Australian Day, who won four tournaments from late July to mid-September, including his first major at the PGA Championship.
The Texan though regained the number one spot with his win in the closing Tour Championship, clinching the FedEx Cup into the bargain.
McIlroy in contrast had a mixed bag of a year, failing to add to his haul of major titles which remains at four.
He only had himself to blame after being forced to miss the defence of his British Open crown because of an ankle ligament injury picked up during an impromptu football kickabout with friends.
But the 26-year-old from Northern Ireland finished the year strongly, a superb showing in Dubai in November giving him the DP World Tour Championship title and the Race to Dubai European Tour crown.
Spieth says he fully expects himself to win at least one major championship in 2016, but he believes it might be too early to put himself and Day up on a pedestal with McIlroy.
I think for Rory its a bit different because hes been consistent for a number of years now, he said.
Its still so early in my career so its hard for me to compare to others. But what an exciting year it was for golf, with so many young players playing so well.
If Rory was healthy for the whole year he would have made a bigger impact than he was able to make in a shorter season. And then with what Rickie Fowler did this season, breaking through with three wins and Jason and myself it was exciting.
McIlroy says he has learned a lesson from the football injury mishap and that he is energised by the challenge presented by such as Spieth and Day.
But his current focus is very much on the Masters at Augusta National in April where he will attempt, for the second straight year, to become just the sixth man to win all four of golfs majors.
Its always going to be there until I get to put a green jacket on my back, he said.
Its obviously the first real goal of the year is to try and get ready for the Masters and be in as good a shape as possible going in there.
But golfs in a great place. Guys are playing better than ever it seems like, at least for me, the last couple of years.
As for Woods, the 14-time major winner turns 40 on December 30 at a time when his very future in the game is up in the air.
Asked in early December if it was possible he may not play at all in 2016 as he recovers from two operations on his back in September and October, Woods replied: You know, Ive been asked this quite a bit lately and the answer is I dont know, only because I really dont, I really dont.
For my 20 years out here, I think Ive achieved a lot, and if thats all it entails, then Ive had a pretty good run. But Im hoping thats not it.
Im hoping that I can get back out here and compete against these guys.
But if thats not the case anymore, then Ill find other avenues, that being growing my foundation, golf course design or other projects I have going on right now that will certainly take up more of my time.

Djokovic and Serena reign despite sudden impact shocks

PARIS, MONDAY: Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams celebrated seasons of epic proportions, claiming six of eight Grand Slam titles in a march to greatness dented only by two players producing once-in-a-lifetime performances.
Djokovic ended 2015 with 11 titles, 82 wins and just six defeats in a haul which included three of the four majors -- the Australian and US Opens and Wimbledon.
His on-court earnings of $21 million swelled his career total to a mind-boggling $94 million while the 28-year-old Serb now has 10 Grand Slam titles amongst his 59 career trophies.
Djokovic won six of the nine Masters and topped it off with a fourth successive end-of-season World Tour Finals triumph in London.
Im very proud to have these achievements with my team, said Djokovic. Its been a long season, but the best of my life.
Djokovic reached the final of every tournament he played with the exception of his 2015 bow in Doha where Ivo Karlovic stunned him in the quarter-finals.
From then on it was one-way traffic -- indoors, outdoors, hardcourt, clay and grass -- the Australian Open, Masters in Indian Wells, Miami, Monte Carlo and Rome and then Wimbledon, US Open, Beijing, the Shanghai and Paris Masters and London
But Djokovic was still left with a case of what might have been thanks to a single-handed backhand blitz delivered by Stan Wawrinka at Roland Garros where a 4-6, 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 defeat left him still seeking a first French Open and a career Grand Slam.
Wawrinka fired 59 winners past Djokovic who finished runner-up for the third time in four years. The defeat left him in tears.
Roger Federer, who hasnt added to his 17 majors since 2012 Wimbledon, continued to defy the critics.
Despite passing 34 in August, the Swiss reached the Wimbledon and US Open finals and handed Djokovic a rare defeat in the round-robin section of the World Tour
Finals before the Serb swept to a comfortable revenge in the title match.
The Swiss ended the year at three in the world and then ended his two-year partnership with coach Stefan Edberg.
Andy Murray finished at two after a season which saw him win his first titles on clay, announce that he will become a father in February and lead Britain to a first Davis Cup in 79 years.
Meanwhile, 14-time Grand Slam winner Rafael Nadal may have lost his iron-grip on the French Open and suffer his worst rankings slump in a decade, but there were encouraging signs of life as the year ticked away.
He made the finals in Basel and Beijing and the semi-finals in London before ending 2015 back at five in the world. The mens tour also endured a seedy controversy when controversial Nick Kyrgios was fined for an ugly sex slur aimed at Wawrinka in Montreal.
What Wawrinka did to Djokovic in Paris in June, unheralded Italian Roberta Vinci did to Serena Williams in New York in September.
Williams was looking to complete the calendar Grand Slam and win a 22nd major.
She looked on course for a routine semi-final win when she took the first set 6-2 against the 32-year-old, wafer-thin Italian who was playing in her first last-four clash at the highest level.
But from nowhere, the world number 43 raced through the next two sets for a famous win and a place in the final against fellow Italian and childhood friend Flavia Pennetta.
Pennetta triumphed for a first Grand Slam crown and promptly announced her retirement.
Williams was so stunned that she called time on her season, sitting out the last three months, an absence which helped Agnieszka Radwanska lift the WTA Championship title.
Williams was still the standout player of 2015, winning five titles in all, including the Australian and French Opens and Wimbledon.
Her record read 53 wins against just three losses and she finished as the year-end world number one for a fifth time and third consecutive season.
She also inflicted a 17th successive win over long-time rival Maria Sharapova in the Wimbledon semi-finals with the Russian star then forced to sit out the US Open with a leg injury.
Sharapova recovered her fitness to make a rare Fed Cup appearance in Novembers final against the Czech Republic but even her two singles wins werent enough to prevent a 3-2 win for the Czechs.

Khawaja fitness doubt after Big Bash pull out

SYDNEY, MONDAY: Australia batsman Usman Khawaja has pulled out of a Twenty20 game this week and faces a fitness check before the Boxing Day Test against the West Indies, Cricket Australia said Monday.
Khawaja, 28, was due to return from a hamstring injury in Thursday's opening Big Bash League match for the Sydney Thunder after being included in the 13-man Australia Test squad for Melbourne.
But Cricket Australia medical staff have ruled him out of the clash against the Sydney Sixers.
Khawaja will need to prove his fitness before Sunday's Big Bash game with the Melbourne Stars, which would be his only remaining fixture before the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground.
If he fails that test, selectors will be spared the onerous decision of trying to put him back into the Australian team at the expense of either Joe Burns or Shaun Marsh.
Khawaja has not played since injuring his hamstring in the second Test against New Zealand in Perth last month, and Australian coach Darren Lehmann said he was not willing to risk him without a warm-up game. "We certainly need him playing and with the hamstring we don't want him playing Test match cricket if he's not fully fit," Lehmann said after Australia's innings first Test defeat of the West Indies in Hobart.
"He will have to be sharp in those Big Bash League T20 games he's playing and get through those -- then we'll make a decision from there."
Khawaja scored 174 and 121 batting at three against New Zealand before he was injured, while his replacement, Marsh, made a strong case for his retention with his highest Test score of 182 in Hobart.
Australia captain Steve Smith is also have treatment for knee and hip injuries in the lead-up to the Melbourne Test, and has been ruled out of the Sixers' opening two Big Bash matches. He said he expected to be fit for the Boxing Day clash.

Madushan and Himaya most outstanding players

Fourteen year old Madushan Suriyabandara of Maliyadewa College, Kurunegala (mens) and Himaya Dewindi of Karandeniya Central College, (women) were adjudged the most outstanding players of the tournament at the annual Moras Table Tennis Championship organized by the University of Moratuwa and worked off over the weekend at the Indoor Stadium of the University of Moratuwa.
Despite the ongoing GCE Ordinary Level Examination there was a very good participation of paddlers at this championship, which turned out to be a successful one for the outstation players who grabbed the major honours.
Fourteen year old Himaya Dewindi from Karandeniya Central College was off to an inauspicious start when she lost the girls under 15 singles event to virtually unknown player Aishath Rafa Nizim of Stag Table Tennis Academy in straight sets. She once again fared badly in the girls under 18 singles, losing this time 2-0 to Amadhi Seya Siyambalapitiya of Musaeus College.
But this little girl did not lose hope and fought back with tenacity in the higher ranked events. She first won the Womens Novices Singles defeating Sanaya Buddhadasa of Visakha College 2-0. Her improved form was evidenced in her winning this event quite comfortably 11/3 and 11/4.
Climbing further higher she won the Womens Intermediate Singles event and her opponent in the finals was once again Sanaya Buddhadasa of Visakha College and won 2-0 in straight sets. But the loser displayed a lot of fight quite different from the earlier one Sanaya lost the first set 11/9 and stretched the winner upto 11/12 and was unlucky not to have leveled the scores which could have forced this event into a possible five sets.
Coming from a school off the beaten track Himaya Dewindi shows plenty of promise and if groomed properly she could be in the reckoning. Her court craft was good and the rallies were well directed. Staging in two age group finals and winning the two higher group events which followed shows she is one of perverance type. Another 14 year old to steal the honours was Madushan Suriyabandara of Maliyadewa College, Kurunegala who won a triple crown by winning the boys under 15 and under 18 singles and rounded off by taking Mens Novices Singles.
Having just entered her teens Aishath Rafa Nizim of Stag Table Tennis Academy  an unknown quantity at table tennis put up a sparkling display to win the girls under 12 and under 15 singles event. Very few girls from the Muslim community participate in sports but this little girl possibly casting aside the purdah put up a grand display to win bother her events in a very convincing manner and did not lose a single set.
Aisath Rafa Nizims win in the girls under 15 event ranks very high as she demolished the ultimate Most Outstanding player Himaya Dewindi by scores of 11/8 and 11/5 which shows that the loser had no chance. One could only hope that she will be in this sport for a long time.
Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy has produced another good paddler in Dinewini Dissanayake who won the girls under 8 singles title with a 2-0 win. Holy Family Convent, Kalutara has produced another good player in Micheli Maleesha who grabbed the girls under 10 titles.
Dulaj Ranatunga of Sussex College, Kandy too came up with a good display in winning the Mens Intermediate event with a 2-0 win in the finals.

PM to relinquish power in case of govts failure
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Parliament yesterday that he had no intention to hold on to power at the expense of the countrys future. He is prepared to forgo power if he cannot take the country on the correct track, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was making a special statement in Parliament yesterday with regard to the governments stance over demands made by trade unions during discussions held with the representatives of trade unions.
The Prime Minister met trade union representatives headed by National Trade Union Front Chairman Saman Ratnapriya on Saturday and Sunday to discuss concerns pertaining to the 2016 Appropriation Bill.
I have been in power and out of power. I am using power to build the country. I have no personal agendas. If I cannot use my powers to build the country, I am prepared to let power go and go home. We do not hesitate to take unpopular decisions for the countrys future. Our decisions may be criticized. But, the future generation will endorse our decisions as correct, Prime Minister said.
He said Rs. 2,000 of Rs. 10,000 allowance given to the public sector employees would be added to their basic salaries from the beginning of the next year. Action would be taken to add the balance to the basic salary in three phases within the next year, he said.
With this addition, there could be questions pertaining to salary anomalies. We would re-establish the national salary commission. We expect that the commission would submit us a report on public sector salaries within six months, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government met trade union leaders during the last couple of days. They asked him to reveal the governments position with regard to their demands, he said.
The Rajapaksa regime misappropriated the monies of the EPF and ETF. We wanted to amalgamate the two funds to increase security and efficiency. But we would maintain them as two different funds under the the Central Bank. We would take action to prevent anyone abusing the funds. The recruitments made to the public sector from 2005 were not regular and not according to the normal procedure. There are no funds to pay pensions. That is a dangerous situation, he said.
In 1963, the elderly population was 5.4 percent of the total population. The figure would increase to around 17.8 percent in 2031 and 27.7 percent in 2050.
The life expectancy has increased. In 1961, the life expectancy was 61.5 years, in 2011, it was 75.3 years. This would reach 81 years in 2050, he said.
With the increased life expectancy, the number of years pensions being paid has increased. In 1960s, the average number of years the pension being paid was five years. This stands around 15 years now. It has been estimated that the number of years pensions to be paid would be around 18 years in 2031 and 20 years in 2050. As a result of this, the allocation for pensions in budget proposals has been on the rise, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
In 1961, the allocation for pensions was Rs. 83 million. This has arisen to Rs. 99,961 millions in 2011. It is estimated to be around Rs. four trillion in 2050, he said.
Rulers with a foresight knew about the pension crisis since 1960s. Dr. NM Perera and several others have pointed this out. But there was no genuine effort to address the problem because of petty political objectives, he said.
The Rajapaksa regime did not look into the matter with a scientific perspective, but giving into popular politics, the previous government recruited people to the government service haphazardly. They were not concerned about the fact that there would be no funds to pay pensions for those who recruited after 2005. They played with the future security of the public servants, the Prime Minister said.
Sri Lanka reached a landmark on January 8. The objective of this journey is to salvage the country from the ditch of corruption and inefficiency and uphold it above marching forward with the rest of the world. It is not an easy task. The journey before us is hard but we must move ahead. There are huge challenges. We would have to think of the common good over personal gains. We would have to make sacrifices, he said.
We do all these to ensure a better future for this country.
That was the objective of the policy statement presented to Parliament by President Maithripala Sirisena, the mid-term economic policy presented to Parliament by myself and the budget proposals by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government provided reliefs for the people through the budget proposals and will continue to take measures to improve public welfare.

About 8,000 acres to be released for resettlement
About 8,000 acres of private lands under the control of the forces in the North will be released for resettlement, said Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Minister D.M. Swaminanthan yesterday.
He made this observation in Parliament participating at the committee stage debate of the budget proposals under the financial head of the Prison Reforms, Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry.
The government is in the process of releasing lands for the resettlement of IDPs in their original places of living. About 1,000 acres of Jaffna, 500 acres of Kilinochchi and 1,000 acres of Sampoor, Trincomalee and other small plots of land were released by the State for resettlement purposes, Minister Swaminathan said.
He said the government is committed to releasing lands occupied by the military in the North and East to resettle the displaced people.
The government is committed to releasing remand prisoners who have been detained for a long period without a charge sheet or for minor offences, minister Swaminathan said.
Thirty nine remand prisoners have been granted bail. The Attorney General Department is examining to release other prisoners, he said.
He said the Commissioner General of Rehabilitation has rehabilitated 12,000 ex-combatants and reintegrated them into the society.
Reform efforts on prisons including relocation, reducing congestion, involving detainees in development, open air prison camps, improving of infrastructure facilities, improving health conditions of prisoners and integrating prisoners into the society are being considered for implementation, minister Swaminathan said.
Shifting prisons in Welikada, Badulla, Tangalle and other prisons from commercially developing cities to far away areas is being implemented. ICRC guidelines will be followed to design new prisons to ensure international standards, he said.
The Bogambara prison has been shifted to Pallekelle. The Tangalle prison will be shifted to Angunakolapelassa by June 2016. The Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to undertake a 65,000 housing programme with concessionary financial arrangements to displaced families, the minister said.
He said the Indian government has helped construct 46,000 housing units under its grant assistance programme. He said Pakistan, Kazakhstan and Bahrain have supported the construction of over 500 houses in the Mannar district. They are under construction, he said.
About 3,400 housing units will be provided and livelihood and income generation support will be extended to the conflict affected families under the European Union grant programme.
The ministry undertook relocation programmes and provided alternative locations to displaced families as a result of military occupation in private lands. The Keppapilavu relocation programme in the Mullaitivu district with 287 houses is an example, minister Swaminathan said.

Motion to convert House into Constitutional Council on January 9

Money in lieu of fertilizer systematised - Ven. Rathana Thera
JHU MP Ven. Athuruliye Rathana Thera told Parliament yesterday that it is on a systematic way that money is being provided in lieu of the fertilizer subsidy.

We are spending a huge amount of foreign exchange to import fertilizer every year. Artificial fertilizer contains substances harmful to humans and animals, Rathana Thera said.

Republican leaders kidding themselves - Donald Trump

US: Republican frontrunner Donald Trump pushed back Sunday against party leaders reportedly looking to block his path to the presidential nomination, saying they were kidding themselves, as rival Ted Cruz surged in polls.
The push to stop Trump comes as the billionaire real estate tycoon finds himself at the center of a firestorm over his call to ban Muslims from entering the United States.
The Washington Post reported on Thursday that Republican powerbrokers argued at a recent dinner that the party should plan to coalesce around an alternative at the nominating convention if Trump storms through the primaries. I think they're making a big mistake. I think I'm the one to beat Hillary, Trump told Fox News Sunday, referring to the Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton.
His message to the Republican establishment: I'm sorry I did this to you, but you've got to get used to it. It's one of the problems in life.
A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll shows Trump in the lead with 27 percent among Republicans nationally, and other polls give him similar leads in many state contests for the party's presidential nomination.
But the NBC poll also showed that Cruz, a conservative senator who has been careful not to publicly criticize Trump, has surged into second place nationally with 22 percent.
And a Des Moines Register poll out late Saturday said Cruz was leading by 10 points among Republicans in Iowa, site of the first nomination contest February 1.
It's Cruz-mentum. Ted Cruz is crushing it in Iowa, Jennifer Jackson of the Des Moines Register said in a video on the paper's website.
Cruz's 31 percent showing in Iowa versus Trump's 21 percent followed a December 7 Monmouth University poll that also put the Texas senator in the lead in the state.
Cruz has surged as retired neurosurgeon Ben Carson has faded in Iowa, a rise and fall attributed to renewed focus on security issues in the wake of the December 2 attack by a Muslim couple that left 14 dead in California.
Carson polled fourth in the NBC/Wall Street Journal poll at 11 percent, and third in Iowa at 13 percent in the Des Moines Register poll. Meanwhile, Florida Senator Marco Rubio was third in the national poll with 15 percent and fourth in Iowa with 10 percent.
Trump's response to the Cruz challenge was that the Texas senator lacked the temperament and judgment to be president.
The way he's dealt with the Senate, where he goes in frankly like a bit of a maniac. You never get things done that way, he said. You can't walk into the Senate and scream and call people liars and not be able to cajole and get along with people. He'll never get anything done. That's the problem with Ted, he said.
Questions about Trump's own temperament and suitability to be president have been fodder for debate since he called Monday for a complete and total ban on Muslims entering the United States.
The remarks were roundly denounced by Republican leaders as well as the White House, and drew expressions of outrage from around the world. Secretary of State John Kerry said Sunday that Trump's anti-Muslim remarks endanger national security and that his proposed ban amounted to a very dangerous foreign policy that would help jihadist recruiters.
I think it's got a huge downside in terms of American foreign policy and I hear this from foreign ministers and others as I travel and engage with people in various countries, Kerry said on CBS News Face the Nation. But Trump defended the ban in his appearances on the Sunday talks shows, insisting Muslims should be kept from entering the United States until we get our hands around this problem.

World, Arab powers back Libya unity government

ITALY: A US and Italy-led coalition of world powers and regional players on Sunday urged Libya's warring factions to lay down their weapons and back a new national unity government under a UN peace plan due to be signed on Wednesday.
US Secretary of State John Kerry was among ministers and officials from 17 countries who, along with the UN, the EU and the Arab league, called for an immediate ceasefire across Libya.
They pledged support for efforts to end the chaos that has engulfed the North African state since the 2011 overthrow of Moamer Kadhafi, and to reduce the risk of Islamic State (IS) expanding its presence.
"We came here today because we cannot allow the status quo to continue," Kerry said at the close of talks attended by 15 officials from different wings of Libya's splintered political class.
"It is dangerous for the viability of Libya, dangerous for Libyans and, because of Daesh (IS) migrating there, dangerous for everyone.
"We refuse to stand by and watch a vacuum filled by terrorists."
Kerry dismissed criticism that the proposed Government of National Accord was being imposed from outside in the absence of consensus on the ground, and amid a security situation which makes it uncertain that the new administration will be able to base itself in the capital Tripoli.
"This is a process driven by Libyans, they are determined to do this," the top US diplomat said.
The ministers were joined in the afternoon by the Libyan officials from factions in the country's rival parliaments, an internationally-recognised one based in Tobruk and an Islamist-backed assembly in Tripoli.
Some representatives of both assemblies have tentatively agreed to sign the UN plan in Morocco on Wednesday but it remains unclear how much opposition it will encounter.
Kerry insisted that majorities of both parliaments supported the peace plan and said only fringe players were obstructing progress.
The figures who had come to Rome "have decided they are not going to let Libya be the prisoner of one or two people or small groups," he said.
UN envoy Martin Kobler, who brokered the accord due to be signed on Wednesday, said: "They represent the majority, the voice of the people of Italy."
The accelerated diplomacy reflects fears in Western capitals that instability in Libya will allow IS-allied groups to expand beyond a small section of coastline they currently control around the city of Sirte. Anarchy in Libya has also given people traffickers a free hand to use the country as a launchpad from which hundreds of thousands of migrants have been sent to Europe in the last two years. European governments want that route closed off amid fears a looming humanitarian crisis in Libya could accelerate the flux.
