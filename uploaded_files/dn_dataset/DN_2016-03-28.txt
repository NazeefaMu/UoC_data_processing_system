Brilliant Kohli takes India into World T20 semis
Mohali, Sunday: India qualified for the World Twenty20 semifinals and knocked out Australia after Virat Kohli smashed an unbeaten 82 in their do-or-die showdown in Mohali on Sunday.
Kohli's powerful 51-ball knock propelled India to a six-wicket victory, as they successfully chased down Australia's 160-6 to keep their dreams alive of becoming the first nation to win two World T20 titles.
India, who won the inaugural tournament in 2007, now face the West Indies in the semi-finals in Mumbai on Thursday after finishing second in the Super 10 group stage.
But Australia's hopes of winning their first ever World T20 trophy are once again in tatters, with the top-ranked Test side now bowing out of the tournament.
New Zealand play England in the other semi-final on Wednesday in New Delhi.
Chasing Australia's challenging total, India had looked down and out at 94-4 but Kohli and skipper Mahendra Singh Dhoni (18 not out) put on 67 runs to take the team to the finish line.
The 27-year-old Kohli planned his knock to perfection, mixing caution with aggression to smash two sixes and nine fours in a pressure-cooker atmosphere at the packed Punjab Cricket Association ground.
Dhoni, who effected three dismissals, hit the winning four with five balls to spare to trigger wild celebrations in the stands.
Shane Watson's international career ended in disappointment although the retiring all-rounder did well to grab two key wickets and a spectacular running catch.
India suffered early setbacks in their chase, with openers Shikhar Dhawan (13) and Rohit Sharma (12) cooling their heels in the dressing room with 37 runs on the board.
Watson proved his worth with the ball, accounting for Dhawan and Suresh Raina in consecutive overs.
Yuvraj Singh, who had to get his ankle strapped after pulling a muscle, made a valiant 21.
Earlier, opener Aaron Finch shared 54 runs for the opening wicket with Usman Khawaja to give Australia a flying start after Steven Smith won the toss and elected to bat.
Khawaja, enjoying a purple patch with the bat, smashed rookie fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah for four boundaries in the second over of the innings.
Finch matched his opening partner in aggression, carting off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin for two sixes on the trot as the Aussies raced to 50 runs inside just four overs.
The early onslaught stunned the Indian crowd, which only came to life when Ashish Nehra got rid of the dangerous Khawaja for 26 off 16 balls.
Ashwin gave India the second breakthrough by having David Warner stumped, and in the process he became the first Indian and 12th player in the world to grab 50 wickets in T20 internationals.
Part-time bowler Yuvraj got rid of Smith for two, before Hardik Pandya dismissed Finch to reduce Australia to 100-4.
Bumrah clipped the stumps of Glenn Maxwell who made 31 off 28 balls, capping a fine turnaround for the bowler after he was whacked for 17 runs in his first over.
Watson remained not out on 18 while Peter Nevill took 10 runs from the final two balls.
Nehra was the standout bowler for India, giving away 20 runs while picking the key wicket of Khawaja.

Vandersay confident of filling Herath's shoes
DELHI: Promising 26-year-old right-arm leg-spinner Jeffrey Vandersay said that he was confident of filling the shoes of left-arm spinner Rangana Herath if given the opportunity.
"As a spinner Herath is a legend. He has done so much for our cricket. As a personal point of view, if I am given those shoes to fill it will be massive shoes to fill. It will take lot of time, but if I get the opportunity I will do it," said Vandersay who in a short space of time - in eight months has represented his country in a World Cup T20 tournament and appeared in 8 T20 Internationals and 3 ODIs.
"The World T20 has been helpful to spinners. A lot of spinners have done well especially the leg-spinners. I am happy to do well for my team and contribute in some way," said Vandersay.
"Yesterday the pitch wasn't spinning as much like some of the other wickets you have seen in India. I thought it will spin and I tried to get some spin. Then I tried to fire it in and not let the batsman get runs off me. The key for you as a spinner is to bowl dot balls in this format and not to get hit for boundaries. The length is the key. The England spinners gave a bit of width and that helped us," he said.
Vandersay is confident the present team given time will develop into a good fighting unit.
"Though we are out of the competition we fight hard. That's the Sri Lankan spirit. We would not take things lightly and we will play to win," said Vandersay.
"We have a young team. We lost three big names in the past year. We are a team in the rebuilding and I am sure we will do well in the longer run," he said.

We didn't deserve a semi-final place - Mathews
DELHI: Angelo Mathews, the Sri Lanka captain admitted that his team didn't deserve a place in the World T20 semi-finals because the way they played.
Sri Lanka, the defending champions were knocked out of the semi-finals when they lost their Group 1 match to England by 10 runs at the Feroz Shah Kotla grounds here on Saturday. The result was heartbreaking not only for Sri Lanka but also for South Africa who needed an England defeat to stand a chance of qualifying for the semi-finals. England qualified with West Indies from the group.
"If you look at the style we played we are not deserving of a semi-final place. The team didn't play well. That's why we lost," said Mathews at the post-match press conference. "We haven't been consistent enough. Our batting unit hasn't been consistent. They've performed well in patches. Playing in a tournament like this, you need to be performing consistently to go all the way. "We've gotten better in each and every game. Unfortunately the finishing touches weren't there. We've got a fairly inexperienced team but that's not an excuse. This is the big stage. This is the World Cup and we've all got to perform to go to the semi-finals," he said.
"In all three matches, we didn't give up easy victories, including against West Indies. In some instances we played poorly, but we didn't give the games up easily. I appreciate that - we fought a little. But then again, a loss is a loss. Whether you lose by a little or a lot, it makes little difference. We've lost two matches, and we won't be chosen for the semi-finals, but there are lessons from this."
As defending World T20 champions the Lankan team's performances leading upto yesterday's defeat was pretty ordinary. In their last 10 T20 internationals they had wins only against UAE and Afghanistan - two associate member countries.
"It has been a disappointing few months for all of us. We've let down the fans and we've let down the whole country. We haven't played good cricket at all. We're disappointed," said Mathews.
"All we can do is try and stick to our combinations and not try and change the team too much. Try to pick about 20 players and re-evaluate them over six months - give them an opportunity to settle down and see what they come up with in terms of performances. We can take decisions then. Quick decisions won't solve this matter. We have to try and be patient."
Reflecting back on the loss to England, Mathews stated, "Our plan in this match was to score a lot of runs in the first six overs, and lose no fewer than two wickets. Unfortunately we lost four wickets. After that it was difficult. Still, we could have won, but we lost that opportunity. England's fielding was very good. Those two catches - especially off Dasun Shanaka - turned the game. We will take some lessons from this, and we really need to develop in all three disciplines.
"After losing four wickets up front in the first six overs, it was a good comeback by the batting unit. At the end of the day we ended up losing and credit should go to the English team. We had nothing to lose after we were 15/4. We were running out of overs as well, so we had to get going. Myself and Kapu thought we would target a few bowlers - to try and get our eye in, in the first couple of overs, and then target a few bowlers. It worked, but unfortunately I didn't have a batter with me on the other side in the last couple of overs. It was a really good wicket."Mathews who pulled a hamstring muscle injury while batting, was virtually on one leg as he tried courageously to chase down the target of 172.
He finished unbeaten on 73, but the injury cast doubts on whether he could be fit for today's (Monday) game against South Africa.
"If I had another batter towards the end I could have given up a single and let the other one hit, but I couldn't really run as well. It feels pretty bad," said Mathews.
"My leg is not in a good state, I think. We'll see if I can play the next game. I will probably go for a scan with the physio tomorrow. As far as I know, it's not great. It feels like a tear. But the physio will assess it and let me know if I can play the next match or not."
