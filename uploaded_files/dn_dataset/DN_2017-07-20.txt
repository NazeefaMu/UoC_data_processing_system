Minister Akila wants to commercialise Dambulla Temple
The Movement to Protect historical Dambulla Cave Temple yesterday said Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam has not given up his attempt to commercialise Dambulla Historical Cave Temple.
Addressing a press conference in Dambulla, Movement Chief Organiser Upali Ranjith said the minister wants to convert this historical place of worship into a money spinning commercial entity.
This will lead to a rift within the Maha Sangha, he said.
Ranjith added that this temple was offered to the Maha Sangha by King Walagambaha for the well-being of the Buddha Sasana.
He added that nobody obstructed the construction activities at the historical cave temple. Ranjith said the Archaeological Department has to take the responsibility of any damages to the artefacts and archaeological items at the Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya.
He also said the movement was established to protect the Rangiri Dambulla Raja Maha Viharaya and other Buddhist heritage sites in Dambulla.

New economic orientation will offer more opportunities for entrepreneurs
Following is the text of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe's viewpoint on Sri Lanka's economic direction for the Oxford Business Group website:
Sri Lanka has developed a variety of distinct economic sectors, which are capable of further integrating the countrys economy into the global value chain.
The digital economy, tourism and commercial agriculture are coming of age in terms of their potential to offer high-value skills and remuneration to young jobseekers in the country.
The new economic orientation will include fewer opportunities with the government, and more exposure and opportunities for entrepreneurs and skilled professionals. We aim to accelerate the broad basing of opportunities in these segments.
The digital economy will empower our nation by providing affordable and secure internet connectivity to every citizen in Sri Lanka, removing barriers for cross-border international trade. A platform for cashless payments will also be created. In addition, digital technology will be added to the school curriculum. We plan to foster entrepreneurship opportunities in digital commerce, while providing training in cyber-security monitoring and response.
We shall strive to attain the status of a modern manufacturing economy that will include high-tech equipment.
We plan to overcome the bottlenecks associated with being a middle-income country in our pursuit towards greater prosperity for our people.
We will establish a public commercial enterprise board that will manage state-owned enterprises (SOEs), enabling them to be more efficiently run on a commercial basis, ensuring value for money. We are creating a public wealth trust through which shares in SOEs will be held in trust for the people.
With the passage of the microfinance legislation in Parliament earlier this year, rural microfinance is now a legitimate activity.
Urgent measures are being undertaken to link foreign microfinance providers with local communities to promote greater credit penetration in rural areas.
The ministry has already allocated LKR5bn ($34.1m) for a special small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) financing scheme to empower business formation and development. A National Financial Inclusion Policy will be developed by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to set quantitative targets for opening of accounts, disbursement of SME loans and so on.
To enable this, we will be consolidating rural development banks (RDBs).
RDBs have become the main channel for concessional lending to SMEs, and their decentralised management structure is being reinforced by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka through its newly created regional departments.

Al Aman responds to Tall Tale claims
Confusion and chaos ensue:
During a two-plus hour press conference at the companys headquarters yesterday, the directors of the Al Aman World Capital Centre Ltd. were questioned by journalists over the integrity of the companys debut project, a proposed super skyscraper in the heart of Colombo.
Pressed by journalists about the simple claim Al Aman World Capital Centre has made repeatedly, that the company holds an international portfolio, the directors admitted that not a single brick has been laid, or a single project started, outside of (or even inside) Sri Lanka.
The stage was set, with multiple rows of chairs lined up around the lobby of 60 Davidson Road in Colombo 4 and refreshments being served. Seated front and center before a crowded room were the directors of the Al Aman World Capital Centre (WCC), a proposed super skyscraper in the heart of Colombo said to be on track for completion by 2023. The conference was presided over by Dr.Arosha Fernando, Dr. Senaka De Silva, and Vivek Anandarajah, all company directors, and Ms. Rosheile Nonis and S.P.Srikantha, introduced as the companys lawyer.
A press conference, the first in WCCs history according to the host, had been called by the companys directors to clarify the medias misconceptions about the project, Deputy Chairman and WCC Spokesman Dr. Senaka De Silva said, speaking in Sinhalese.
But the clarifications never came. Instead, the scene that played out over the next two hours was one of chaos and confusion.
After a brief series of introductory videos and introductory speeches by both Senior Deputy Chairman Vivek Anandarajah and Deputy Chairman Senaka De Silva, the floor was opened to questions from the audience. The back and forth began calmly.
The Daily News first asked how much capital had been raised so far for the project; US $200 million by 31 December 2017 is required for the Board of Investments (BOI) agreement with the WCC, and the project is estimated by WCC to cost a total of US $2.4 Billion.
All $2.4 Billion is arranged with a money funding company already, said Anandarajah. When the Daily News pressed for more details, asking for the identity of the money funding company. Anandarajah declined to answer. This information I dont feel comfortable to disclose because this is our confidential information. This is a business enterprise.
Next, the Daily News questioned the international portfolio that Al Aman World Capital Center has boasted of repeatedly, including in its media brief handed out at the press conference, which includes the following description of the company:
...A globally renowned company with an international network reckoned with its operations in UK, UAE, Malaysia and all over the world... Noting that Al Aman Groups website, which similarly labeled itself an international operation, had been taken down, the Daily News asked for the directors to explain what their company has done internationally.
The directors could not provide a single example of a company, property, or project elsewhere, instead claiming broadly that without international connection we cant come and we cant do this stuff. Then, they tried to deflect, saying, I
think we are discussing the project to be built in Colombo. Im here to talk about WCC Sri Lanka.
Another source of contention arose from the question of who, in fact, would be running the World Capital Centre. On Al Aman Groups website, since taken down, the board members listed are Asaid Ahmed, Lakshman Benedict Perera, Imran Saleem,
Mohamed Ashraff, Wijendran Balakrishnan, and Constantino Zevallos Bujaico  none of whom were in attendance at the press conference.
When asked about the relationship between that board to the directors present at the conference, no clear answer was provided; at times, the directors present seemed to suggest both that they had never met anyone from Al Aman Groups, the supposed parent company of the Al Aman World Capital Centre Ltd., and that they were operating completely independent of Al Aman Groups. This was all while insisting that they were in fact a subsidiary of Al Aman Groups. Not even the lawyer present, Mr. S.P. Srikantha, could answer the question of the relationship between Al Aman Groups and Al Aman World Capital Ltd.
I dont know. I am only representing the local company, said Srikantha.
The list goes on. When asked about the tentative location of the project, the directors provided no answers. When asked about the conflicting claims that the WCC would have a seven- and ten-star-hotel, despite the fact that such certification is near impossible to attain, the directors provided no solution. When asked about the disparity in the projected cost of the project  US $1.2 Billion, US $2 Billion, or US $2.4 Billion  the directors provided no clarification. When asked about what the guarantees to investors were, the directors said none.
The press conference was called to clarify misconceptions about the project, but it seems that at its end, confusion only further abounded.

Apparel, fish exports to soar after GSP+ - Minister
Sri Lanka can get multiple benefits as a result of the lifting of the European fishing ban, said Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade, Malik Samarawickrama.
Speaking at the European Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka (ECCSL) and the Euroepan Union Delegation to Sri Lanka and Maldives organized conference titled Sri Lanka - the Next Asian Economic Miracle, the Minister said that now is the time to exploit benefits from this fisheries expansion.
The fisheries sector expects a substantial growth through the regained EU GSP+ facility. They expect that the demand for fisheries products would double the current export value, whilst employing sustainable and responsible fishing practices.
For January to May 2017, fisheries exports are up by over 40% compared to the same period last year. The industry plans to have new projects such as fish farming and deep sea fishing to increase production capacities to meet the increased demand from the EU envisaged through the GSP+.
Similarly considerable gains are expected through the exports in agriculture product categories such as fresh and processed vegetables and fruits, processed food including coconut-related products, Minister said.
Benefits of GSP+ status will need to trickle down to Sri Lankas rural workforce.
It is estimated that there will be an annual increase in apparel exports of US$ 500 million as a result of the GSP+ benefit creating approximately 20,000 jobs. It is now expected that more EU customers would change their sourcing strategy in favour of Sri Lanka in comparison with other duty free beneficiaries such as Bangladesh and Cambodia.
Given that Rules of Origin under GSP+ require fabric to be sourced from Sri Lanka or from an area that qualifies for regional cumulation in order to qualify for GSP+, there will be an increase in demand for fabric sourced from Sri Lankan fabric mills, rather than from countries such as China.
We have also set the ambitious task of jumping 40 places in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business Index by 2020 and are conscious that other countries are not remaining still.
Minister of Finance and Mass Media Mangala Samaraweera said that the government is concentrating on several new areas to strengthen the economy and increasing tax revenue too would be a priority.
Minister Samaraweera also said that they are looking at relaxing some of tough and uncalled-for business regulations to simplify business.
We will also being in more investor-friendly regulations soon.

Australian assistance to combat dengue
Visiting Australian Foreign Affairs Minister Julie Bishop yesterday announced Australian assistance to combat dengue in Sri Lanka.
Bishop made this announcement at the press briefing after calling on Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake and Health and indigenous Medicine Minister Dr Rajitha Senaratne at the Foreign Affairs Ministry.
The two Governments exchanged letter of intent to work together to eliminate Dengue in Sri Lanka. As the first step the World Health Organization will be given Rs 58 million grant to immediately implement intensive dengue prevention and control measures in Sri Lanka. As a long term project, Monash University in Australia will partner with the Health and Indigenous Medicine Ministry in Sri Lanka to use ground-breaking research pioneered by Australian scientists to prevent the spread of dengue.
Monash University will trial the introduction of naturally occurring Wolbachia bacteria to Sri Lankan mosquito populations. Wolbachia prevents transmission of dengue virus between humans. It has been highly successful and has been used in countries like Brazil, Colombia, Australia, Indonesia, Vietnam and India, Bishop explained.
Monash University will utilize a grant of Rs 116 million from an Australias research institute to undertake trials in Sri Lanka to use this method for elimination of dengue. Minister Dr Senaratne, thanking the Australian Government for the assistance to control dengue, said a written agreement with regard to the programme would be signed once its details are finalized by the two Governments.

CA Sri Lanka calls for applications for annual report awards
The Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) is now accepting applications for the coveted 53rd Annual Report Awards Competition from companies producing annual reports.
The competition will honour the most cohesive, clear and customized annual reports that better reflect an entitys operations, whilst going beyond their statutory boundaries of reporting.
With a history spanning over half a century, the Annual Report Awards (ARA) has created an important benchmark as a competition that promotes the core elements of transparency, social responsibility and good governance.
The ARA has helped organisations from multinationals, conglomerates, NGOs, to even SMEs improve transparency and accountability in financial reporting, while also enhancing Sri Lankas reporting standards in line with best global practices.
The competition will revolve around the theme 'Quintessence of Eminence' this year. Entries for the 53rd Annual Report Awards Competition will close on August 31.
Organisations from small-time community groups to large-scale conglomerates representing 25 sectors including banking institutions, state banks, diversified holdings, finance companies and leasing companies, food and beverages companies, healthcare institutions, trading companies, hotel companies, insurance companies, land and property companies, manufacturing companies, motor companies, service organisations, telecommunication companies, unit trusts, media and entertainment, state corporations and statutory boards, plantation companies, construction companies, power and energy companies, not-for-profit organisations (NPOs) including non-governmental organisations (NGOs) and small and medium sized entities, can vie for honours at this years competition.
Apart from the overall winners and the winners under each respective category, the competition will also reward organisations for Corporate Governance Disclosure, Corporate Social Responsibility Reporting, Management Commentary, Integrated Reporting, Integrated Reporting - Best Disclosure on Capital Management and Integrated Reporting - Best Disclosure on Business Model.
CA Sri Lanka President Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that an essential ingredient of a good financial report is accurate, timely and comprehensive corporate disclosure. He noted that this not only helps foster the confidence of shareholders and investors of a company, but also contributes to the building up of the company's public image and reputation.
As Sri Lanka strives towards becoming an upper middle-income country, there is an increasing importance for organisations, from the public and private sectors to be more accountable and responsible, he said.
He recalled that in 2016, the competition set a new record when it received the highest number of applications from 140 companies.
Wickremasinghe assured that if there has been one thing consistent about this competition, it has been its independence. The evaluation of the competition is carried out at three rounds. The initial selection process is conducted by a technical marking panel and then the shortlisted annual reports are subjected to an intense technical review by a panel of industry experts. At the third and final stage of judging, the shortlisted annual reports are reviewed by the final panel of judges. The overall winners are selected purely on merit, irrespective of the sector and the financial performance, he said.
Wickremasinghe added that the evaluation is carried out by highly respected professionals including industry specialists, business leaders and chartered accountants.
Chairman of the Annual Report Awards Committee Sanjaya Bandara pointed out that a good annual report, no doubt entails a great deal of clarity in the presentation of financial and non-financial information that promotes transparency, accountability and good governance.
Therefore, we extend an invitation to the corporates in Sri Lanka to join hands at the 53rd Annual Report Awards competition and demonstrate their continuing commitment towards best practices in annual corporate reporting, he said. Bandara said that the institute was continuing to update the checklists of the competition to keep pace with the changes to the accounting standards and other relevant pronouncements. He added that this year the competition has introduced new segments within the manufacturing, banking institutions, finance and leasing sectors to enhance competitiveness among the corporates in these respective sectors.

CHILDREN SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO BASIC THINGS
As parents, it is difficult for parents to let children do their own things. Children want to have fun. But as parents we want them to be safe, polite and clean.
However, children really need to have their own space if they are going to be successful in life.
They need to learn how to perform tasks for themselves.
Rules should be part of every childs life. But too many rules can limit their creativity and growth.
We must allow children to do following basic things.
We must allow them to eat by themselves. This will help them to learn important skills that they will need for the rest of their lives. They will also gain confidence from knowing they can use a spoon.
Parents should let kids help with household tasks. As children get older, helping with work allows them to learn responsibility and how to take care of themselves.
We must allow children to express their creativity. We must allow children to paint whatever they want.
So allow children to do creative things like painting or handcraft.
We must allow them to say what they think. Children need be able to say what they think about certain situations. By learning how to express their feelings about certain situations, they will be able to grow up into better prepared adults with good communication skills.
We must allow children to have fun and get dirty. Kids need to have fun in order to learn. Much of what kids learn happens during playtime. They explore the world around them, develop social skills and develop emotionally.
Many children who are not allowed to play freely when they are younger will have harder time adjusting when they are older.
These things children should be able to do. So do not try to control children too much.

Cloud of doubt over worlds largest building
The first official press conference of the proposed World Capital Centre (WCC), the worlds largest and 9th tallest building, to be constructed in the heart of the Colombo city, ran into a storm since the officials concerned failed to provide proof of solid investors. The media event was held at the WCC main office and it was also disclosed that though the BOI agreement was signed last month, the land for the project is yet to be identified.
We have looked at three properties in Dematagoda, Borella and Colombo Fort and will finalize one of them soon, said Deputy Chairman Dr. Senaka De Silva. In addition we may also acquire a 14-acre plot of land, he said.
De Silva said that the total investment for the project, to be completed in 2023 and towering 117 floors with hotels and a residential building which will include gold-plated high-end apartments and commercial spaces, would be US$ 2.5 billion. The entire funding would be raised from overseas and a Dubai company would handle the construction.
He also said that WCC was launched two years ago by President Maithripala Sirisena at the BMICH and there was a two-year delay by the BOI to sign the necessary agreement.

Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera: DSG Dileepa Peiris gives evidence
Deputy Solicitor General (DSG) Dileepa Peiris yesterday, identified Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera in the Court of Appeal as the person who was involved in the alleged offensive behaviour at the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25 last year.
DSG Dileepa Peiris gave evidence regarding the contempt of court action filed against Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court. When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (CA) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, DSG Peiris informed that in the evening of January 25, 2016, he got to know through a policemen at the court premises that Ven. Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address the Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
Meanwhile, former Homage Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is now serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate informed Court that he firmly determined to take legal action against the monk since the offence took place in his presence.
He further said he had never experienced such an offensive behavior by a person in his 12 years judicial career. Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake made these remarks in response to a query made by Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva.
Meanwhile, Magistrate Range Dissanayake yesterday, concluded his evidence and DSG Peiris will further testify on the next date of inquiry.
Gnanasara Thera began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings.
He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept White Mans Law (suddage neethiya) and requested for the release of remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings, but he continued to do so, the Magistrate said.

A creative approach to acquire skills
Create Lab is an education facilitator headquartered in Singapore provides the essential tools and facilities to assist children to develop digital skills and an inventive mindset, that will empower them to thrive in the 21st century. Equipped with resources and expertise from educators from Oxford, MIT and Singapores top universities, Create Lab Sri Lanka commenced operations in January this year. Its coding and robotic design workshops have been recognized as Singapores leading Computational Thinking enrichment programmes and these programmes caters to children in the age groups of 5 to 12 years.
Create Lab workshops and programmes are designed to encourage children to explore possibilities and acquire skills through a hands on personalized approach. The learning environment provided at Create Lab includes role-playing, storytelling, art and music which challenge children to tackle everyday problems by developing solutions through their own computer programmes and hardware.
In an increasingly digitalized world, the skills that will usher in success are going to be ones ability to imagine, create, empathize and solve problems. Computer programming and coding skills are powerful tools that can stimulate and bring forth these already existing abilities within children. Coding helps children improve their analytical thinking and help them look at the bigger picture. Empowering children to use technology to create rather than just consume, is what we do best, Create Lab Co-Founder/Chief Executive Officer, Thilan Wickramasinghecommented in a recently issued press release.
Commenting on the work that Create Lab has initiated in Sri Lanka, Create Lab Director, Michelle Pinto said, Our main introductory programme Introduction to Computational Thinking (ICT101) will inspire students to become powerful computational thinkers. During our workshops students can code their own computer games, digital art, programme robots and develop hardware. Our focus is to inspire children to experiment, solve problems, identify patterns and use their imagination.
These are highly portable skills that will help them excel in school and at home, but most importantly in their future careers.
The children are exposed to some of the state-of-the-art software and hardware solutions available and, Create Lab collaborates with the National University of Singapore (NUS) Enterprise, Google, SoftBank and the Infocomm & Media Development Authority of Singaporeto develop their solutions. Create Lab also provides free cloud based resources to allow children to share their work with family and friends and continue to improve their approaches, outside the classroom.

The curse of dengue
When the leader of the outlawed gang met the famed US Marshall Wyatt Urp in a saloon, he asked him whether he is still a Marshall. Wyatt replied he has retired. When the outlaw asked Doc Halliday, the consumptive ex-dentist, who often admitted his constant coughing led to the loss of his practice as a teeth puller, whether he too has retired, Halliday walked to the piano, sat on the stool, and began playing a dirge. Likewise, the retired chairman should have played a mournful lament on his serapina as the gang entered to meet him at his modest Nawala residence, for the damage they had done to the poor with their strikes. No lament was required for the rich. Their wealth cushions them. The white coated hypocrites bleed them and use the poor for practice.
But what we witnessed was a bent obeisance. Why respect a gang who has dragged, a once proud and honoured profession, into the gutter No other profession would have tolerated the muck of the committee. The membership would have gone, like Guy Fawkes, to the headquarters and burned the place down. As the song adequately proclaims Don't cry for me Argentina. It won't be easy. When I try to explain.
Frequent strikes
When the cabal (secret political group) who has turned trade union action into a worthless, rusty tool by their frequent strikes, which the people are now used to, laugh and ignore, met the chairman of the SLMC at his Navala residence he told them he has already retired and warned the cabal not to strike at a time when the country is in the grip of a dengue epidemic.
In addition, if the former chairman of the SLMC had reminded the cabal the disease is stoppable at the gate, by persuading them to campaign against the free silara bags, whatever their thickness, simply by forcing the markets to put out a notice bring your own bag. Target the bags, not the wrappers and tiny lunch boxes. They are players in the margin. Nothing can be wrapped in them and thrown on to the streets. Banning them will deprive the poor mothers who eke out a living, crucial players in Minister Senaratne's vote bank of 6.2 million votes. Why kill the goose that lays the golden egg The volunteer canvassers were referred to in the epistle I wrote two years ago soon after the downfall. How they intercepted many a voter and told where their ballots must be deposited.
Scientific truth
Get out of Wall Street on to Main Street before drafting laws that effect the consumer. When you talk of microns you are just another ignoramus. Microns are in the domain of micrometres, not rulers and in labs not in streets. How standards have plummeted from the days Tom Brown was a schoolboy.
People are dying. Why waste time leaning on experts whether they be from the WHO or pundits who have forsaken the country and live in Hong Kong who is alleged to know all about the vector of the mosquito. Learn to play the notes first. Mozart can come later. Like the way actor Peter Lorre often said: do the easy way, Johnny. There will be squeals from the Capitalists who manufacture the deadly bags. Ignore them. We have nothing to lose but our chains. That is the scientific truth.
Max Plank is a favourite Nobel laureate because his footprints are everywhere in the land of mathematical physics. A constant of the Universe is named after him. The German Erwin Schrodinger divided the Plank constant by 2 pis to obtain the wave function, a function which is the bedrock of quantum theory. For which he too later won the Nobel Prize for physics. Max Plank was the originator of quantum theory and one of the most important German physicists of the early 20th century winning the Nobel Prize in physics in 1918.
A quarter of the GDP of advanced countries is accounted for by quantum based industries. I would be delinquent if I do not mention, even though I enjoyed my sojourn at the University of Ceylon, professors there could not adequately explain the reason why properties of elements repeat themselves in Mendelefs Periodic Table. Quantum theory sweetly explains using the orbitals of electrons.
Plank observed a scientific truth does not triumph by convincing its opponents and making them see the light but rather because its opponents eventually die and a new generation grows up that is familiar with it. Plank went on to observe Science cannot solve the ultimate mystery of nature. And that is because, in the last analysis, we ourselves are part of nature and therefore part of the mystery that we are trying to solve.
The pure rationalist has no place here. Religion and science are fighting a battle in an incessant, never relaxing crusade against scepticism, dogmatism, disbelief and superstition and the rallying cry in that crusade has always been, and always be On to God.
I was enamoured with that insight of Max Plank hence its offer to the reader.

Democrats file no confidence resolution against Trump

Frustrated Democrat politicians in the US House of Representatives have filed an official no confidence resolution against President Donald Trump, formally questioning his suitability to occupy the White House.
The resolution, brought by Rep. Steve Cohen has no chance of successfully passing through the Republican-led chamber, but it provides a comprehensive litany of all of the Presidents controversial actions since taking office.
It lists 88 reasons why the Democrats behind the resolution believe Trump is not suitable to hold the Presidency and ranges from citing the furore over crowd sizes at Trumps inauguration, to the way Trump has handled the investigation into Russian interference in the election.
The list also questions many of Trumps business deals, his regular volleys against what he calls the fake news media, and his derogatory verbal attacks on women.
Its just a sad day for Americans that weve come to this point, Cohen said at a news conference on Wednesday.
Trump is a president that you wouldnt want your children to look up to, Cohen said in Washington.
The way he talks about women, the press, the language he uses, the use of Twitter  you dont want him to be a role model, Cohen said. Its injurious to our culture, and its injurious to  our foreign policy.
The resolution then makes a list of demands and calls on Trump to release his tax returns, to divest his private business assets, to refrain from using Twitter inappropriately, to unequivocally acknowledge that Russia interfered in the 2016 United States Presidential election, and to support the First Amendment (freedom of speech) by supporting the freedom of the press and refrain from calling reporting fake news.
You do not have access to view this Atom.
According to a report in The Hill, Cohen conceded his resolution may have little impact on the President.
Is it going to have an effect on him Apparently, his family members dont have an effect on him, his Republican friends dont, his Cabinet members dont.

A total of 150,000 leaflets are to be distributed among train passengers and students this week to explain ways and means of preventing the spread of dengue mosquitoes.
Meanwhile, the Railway Department will take strict action against those loitering near railway lines, Railway Department Security Head Anura Premaratne said.
They will be arrested and produced before Courts to prevent tragic train accidents, he said.
During the past six months, about 275 persons have died of train accidents countrywide. Among these accidents, some have committed suicide while others were knocked down by trains while they were taking selfies standing on railway lines carelessly, Premaratne said.

Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam: She was a leading academic figure
During my school days and university life, Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam was a leading academic figure due to her contribution towards school education by writing books on education. During my teaching career, she was a model to be followed in our career path. I, as a novice teacher at that time, till now, remember her attractive posture mixed with a holistic personality and a speech made by her at a workshop conducted for teachers at Trincomalee in 1976.
After that, as a project officer of the Research Unit of National Institute of Education (NIE), I had the opportunity to perform my duties as a researcher under Dr. Thilokasundari, the second Director General of the NIE. Once, at a research-steering committee meeting, she expressed the importance of qualitative research to fill the gaps that may arise due to the limitations of quantitative research, using a simple example without taking much time from the committee members.
This type of flexible research was not with many director generals that dominate their roles at NIE through their so-called 'names,' 'arrogance,' 'political power' or 'professorships.'
If we analyse the 32-year-old history of the NIE, the Director General who used the power of the NIE with its maximum capability was Dr. Kariyawasam.
Her power of decision-making was independent and time-saving, as expected from the Act of the NIE enacted in 1985 to 'advise the minister regarding the plans, programmes and activities for the development of education in Sri Lanka.' The strong academic background with the wide range of experiences in schools, education offices, and as a whole on school education, she was able to implement the activities of the NIE with an independent strong mind that helped to strengthen the role and functions of the NIE.
Although the successive director generals from the university system misused the policy framework of the NIE due to their lack of knowledge on school education and blindly followed the university system and politicians they were following, the activities introduced during the period of Dr. Kariyawasam were still at the base of NIE securing the day to day functions and roles of the NIE.
Her contribution towards the expansion of teacher education opportunities by way of developing different teacher education courses around the island is praiseworthy.
Recently, at a lecture on Research Methodology for newly-appointed SLEAS officers, I suggested to conduct 'case studies' and 'life history research' on a number of contributors to the school education system in Sri Lanka.
I emphasised names of three Director Generals of the NIE too and one name was Dr. Kariyawasam. I sincerely hope this task will be performed so that the contribution of Dr. Kariyawasam will be recorded scientifically for the reference of future generations.

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has taken measures to provide e-log books for all multi-day fishing vessels to enter fish harvest information, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The ministry will provide e-log books for 2,328 multi-day fishing vessels at a cost of Rs. 78 million. According to international laws, it is compulsory to maintain records of fish catch information by multi-day fishing vessels engaged in fishing activities in international waters and provide the information to the European Union (EU) to avoid the mismanagement of fisheries resources, said the minister.
Having recognition among the international community as a country which follows international rules and regulations related to the fisheries industry is important to avoid future issues related to the industry such as bans on fishing imports as we experienced recently, the minister added.
The software used in e-log books had been developed by the University of Colombo and the e-log books would be handed over to the owners of multi-day fishing vessels free of charge.
Vessel owners would be trained to use the e-log books, he said.

Former Homagama Magistrate gives evidence in CA
Contempt of Court case against Gnanasara Thera:
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake yesterday, gave evidence regarding a contempt of court action filed against Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera over his alleged offensive behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25 last year.
When the matter came up for inquiry before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Preethi Padman Surasena, the first witness former Homagama Magistrate Ranaga Dissanayake informed that on January 25, 2016, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera unexpectedly began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over.
He began to address Court without obtaining any permission in a manner of obstructing court proceedings. He tended to challenge the judicial authority stating that he would not accept White Mans Law (Suddage Neethiya) and requested for the release of remanded suspects. I instructed him not to behave in a manner of obstructing Court proceedings but he continued to do so, the Magistrate added.
Ven. Gnanasara Thera also began to intimidate Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris who appeared on behalf of the Attorney General, he further said. Meanwhile, Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake who is currently serving as a Colombo Additional Magistrate yesterday, identified Gnanasara Thera in open court as the person who was involved in the alleged offence which took place at the Homagama Magistrates court.
The evidence was led by Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya. Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera. In this case, the Court of Appeal proceedings has listed eight persons including Homagama Magisitrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and Counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
Further inquiry into the matter was fixed for today (19).
On a previous occasion, the Court of Appeal decided to overrule the preliminary objections raised by Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera against the amended charge sheet.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire such a complaint.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution. On a previous occasion, a charge sheet signed by Court of Appeals President Judge had been served on the accused.
In a surprising turn of events, on January 25, Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. Later on, Gnanasara Thera was arrested by police on charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
Through this contempt of Court action, the Homagama Magistrate has sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take necessary legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.

GMOA urges prompt action to implement minimum standards of medical education
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) urges the Health Ministry to take prompt action to implement minimum standards of medical education without any further delay.
The GMOA members addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, claimed that Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was obstructing the process of implementing the minimum standards for medical education.
The minimum standards should be gazetted promptly so as to streamline medical education. The Medical Council (MC) has already prepared a draft of the minimum standards and has sent it to the Attorney General for his recommendations, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
However, he accused the Health Minister that he has been obstructing to the process of legalising the code of minimum standards when considering his political career.
He added that at recent discussions the GMOA had with the Prime Minister, both parties had come to a common stance to implement the code of minimum standards with immediate effect at most within a few weeks period.
There is no need of holding further rounds of discussions with the Prime Minister, if the minimum standards are not implemented, he said. He noted that the Central Committee of the GMOA will discuss the matter on Sunday, July 23, aiming to come to a decision in this regard. According to him the GMOA may go for a tough trade union action even if the relevant authorities fail to implement the minimum standards.
The GMOA accused that the Government has misled people about taking over the ownership of SAITM teaching hospital.
The GMOA will ask the Health Ministry for the details of the bipartite agreement signed between SAITM authorities and the Health Ministry when transferring ownership. Under the Right of Information Act, the GMOA will request the Health Ministry to publish the details of the agreements.

GSP+,new technology will enhance countrys competitiveness - PM
The GSP plus concession is the lynchpin to build our outward-looking, export-oriented economy which will provide jobs and increase incomes, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The premier was delivering the keynote address at a forum organized by the European Chamber of Commerce in Sri Lanka, on Sri Lanka - The Next Asian Economic Miraclehe stressed the potential of Sri Lankas economic growth through the GSP Plus.
Wickremesinghe stressed the opportunities the GSP+ will provide for Sri Lanka, reminding the audience that open markets require open societies.
The GSP Plus (Generalised System of Preferences) is a preferential tariff system which provides for a formal system of exemption from the more general rules of the World Trade Organisation.
The GSP+ is a key to us, because here we have the ability to develop our economy and to develop and strengthen our democracy.
But he also said the opportunities provided by entry to the GSP+ also present a challenge
to Sri Lankas domestic investors, to utilise this opportunity. Because as he explained, success requires the private sector to be strong enough to invest in. Speaking about foreign investors coming to Sri Lanka, not just through GSP Plus but the entire global value chain, he said,
We have to be ready. And the way Sri Lanka becomes ready, he said, is through productivity. Our productivity will enhance our competitiveness. Productivity means a workforce dedicated to productivity. And how do we get a workforce dedicated to productivity Part of the gains have to be shared with the workforce.
The way to do this,Wickremesinghe said, was to move toward a minimum of total pay or allowances and benefits [for the workforce] of US $400. Otherwise, you wont be able to compete. There will be more people driving trishaws than in the factories. Wickremesinghe ended his speech by emphasising the need for a shift in the type of labor demanded from the Sri Lankan workforce, one that would be accentuated by the opportunities provided by entry to the GSP+.
Theres a large low-wage base developing in Bangladesh and Myanmar. We cannot compete with that, and we shouldnt compete with that. The world is changing, new technology is coming in. So where do we want to be The low wage of the t-shirt industry, or the middle part of the 3D printing industry. This is a time that we can make a revolution, a time we can make a revolution peacefully, through the economy.

Renowned for excellence in legal education, the University of London (UOL) as one of the largest and most respected institutions in the world, has had a long and distinguished history of working with top educational institutions around the world, who are selected through a stringent process, to deliver their LLB program.
UOL has in this manner, helped and guided many students towards quality institutions to attain a law degree of repute and global acceptance.
For the selection process of institutes they work with, UOL has introduced a framework through which it recognizes institutions that meet a set of specifications and benchmarks that emulate the high quality standards and criteria it expects. Depending on which set of criteria are met, an institution is then awarded either affiliate center or registered-center status through the framework known as the Institutions Policy Framework.
In order to be recognized as a registered center, an institutions standards in respect of teaching, support and administration has to be at a level acceptable to UOL, which normally takes an institute several years to attain before being eligible to apply for recognition.
It is against this background, that Horizon Campus became the only Government-approved non-state higher education institution in the country to gain the recognition of being awarded the status of Registered Center for the University of London LLB program in a short span of just two years
Outlining the aspects that led to Horizon Campus being awarded the Registered Center Status, Acting Vice Chancellor and Dean for International Programs at Horizon Campus Dr. Ruwan Perera said, "In order to be selected as a registered center of UOL, Horizon had to submit a self-evaluation document (SED), after which a review panel from UOL visited the campus to meet with staff and students and inspected the campuss facilities."
"Horizon then undertook a range of quality assurance procedures, including annual monitoring and periodic review exercises in order to be awarded the registered center status."
By being a registered center, Horizon campus receives the highest level of support from UOL in a variety of areas that will in turn benefit students. These include access to a full range of up-to-date study material, appropriate on line and virtual-learning and marketing support.

Indian HC agrees to consider matching Korean proposal: Rajitha
Sampur LNG power plant:
The Indian High Commissioner has agreed to consider matching the Korean proposal for the Sampur LNG power plant,Co-Cabinet Spokesperson and Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday as questions over the feasibility of the power plant agreed to in 2016 came up for discussion in Cabinet this week.
We had a long discussion on the LNG plant. When President Maithripala Sirisena visited India last year, he told Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi that the Sampur 500 MW coal power plant cannot go through because as the Minister of Environment, he cannot approve it.
Therefore, he suggested that India build a LNG power plant instead. But India is not advanced in LNG plants. So they came up with a joint proposal with Japan, explained Minister Senaratne.
The Minister was addressing the Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department.
In the meantime, Korea too had submitted their proposal for the Sampur power plant and this had proven to be more favourable than the Indian proposal.
While the Korean proposal was more favourable, the government has come to an understanding that they will give the project to the Indian government, said the minister as he stressed that the government could not strain diplomatic relations over a project.
He further explained that the President had asked the Indian High Commissioner to match their proposal with that of the Korean.
Whatever the proposal, the President assured that it will be favourable to Sri Lanka, Minister Senaratne said.
At present, Japan and Korea are the leaders in LNG technology.
We stopped the Coal plant and asked then to go for LNG. We cannot stop this too,the Co-Cabinet Spokesperson said as he justified the decision to continue with the Indian proposal.

Lanka Hospitals surpasses 1,000 IVF births
The internationally accredited, multi award-winning Lanka Hospitals Colombo announces the successful delivery of one thousand IVF (In Vitro Fertilization - commonly known as test-tube) babies.

We at Lanka Hospitals are extremely honoured to announce the surpassing of 1,000 IVF baby births.

The acclaimed Fertility Centre at Lanka Hospitals is operational throughout the year and is equipped with state-of-the-art facilities, with higher rate of success in IVF without disrupting the female partners menstrual cycle.
It has set several benchmarks in the sub-fertility field in Sri Lanka, including the first pregnancy through vitrification and novel investigations such as Reactive Oxygen in Human Semen (ROS) and Sperm DNA Fragmentation Analysis to identify male factor infertility, giving the couple increased chance of conception.
The Centre also expects to introduce an advanced fertility treatment called PGD (Pre-implantation Genetic Diagnosis) where the embryo can be checked for genetic disorders such as Downs Syndrome, haemophilia, thalassemia and gender before being inseminated to the womb.
Lanka Hospitals Clinical Embryologist Dr. Madara Ralapanawe spoke of the high clinical standards of the processes involved in an IVF conception at the clinic.
Since its inception in 2008, Lanka Hospitals Fertility Centre has been able to emulate worlds most successful and developed Centres in practice and outcome.
The Centre is equipped with the most modern facilities and manned by the most experiences professionals in all clinical spheres.

Lanka Hospitals not only ensures the privacy of the would-be parents but also renders vast convenience by ways of minimising hospital visits, treatment methods and hormonal injections, considerably reducing the disruption to their regular lifestyle during IVF treatment.
The success of Lanka Hospitals Fertility Centre can partly be attributed to the strong system support rendered to the Centre by other specialists, such as physicians, urologists, endocrinologists, geneticists, dieticians etc., work in tandem to achieve the highest fertility levels of any sub fertile couple who approaches us, said Lanka Hospitals Consultant Obstetrician and Gynaecologist, Dr. Nishendra Karunaratne.
Lanka Hospitals Chairman Dr. Sarath Paranavitane spoke of the success of Lanka Hospitals Fertility Centre.
A few years ago, fertility treatment was only a dream for most couples due to the high cost involved. Moreover, IVF was mostly popular in the developed world and developing countries such as ours was only testing the waters to introduce this facility to our people as it required expertise and new technology. Lanka Hospitals embraced the concept of IVF and took the bold step to make provision to setup a state-of-the-art fertility centre. We not only made IVF acceptable but also affordable. I am proud that LHC has surpassed 1000 IVF babies and has created new lives and new families.

Last Sri Lanka tour changed Indias mindset, says Kohli
MUMBAI, Wednesday: The odds were against India the last time they toured Sri Lanka in 2015, but Virat Kohli led the inexperienced side to a comeback win in the Test series which changed the team's mindset, the captain said on Wednesday.
"That tour for us was a landmark tour," Kohli told reporters before India's departure for the island country, where the team will play three tests, five one-day internationals and a one-off twenty20 match.
"If you look at the average age of that team a couple of years back... Obviously the players have matured from there on."
India lost the first of the three-test series against their South Asian neighbours but won the next two matches. They have since gone on to beat West Indies away and registered home victories against South Africa, New Zealand, England, Bangladesh and Australia. Kohli's men are currently ranked number one in the world.
"That tour for us was start of the belief that we can win, win away from home and we have the side to win away from home."
India arrived in Sri Lanka in 2015 having lost test series in South Africa, New Zealand, England and Australia, during which long-term captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni retired from the format, handing over the reins to Kohli.
The 28-year-old couldn't lead India to a win in a one-off test against Bangladesh, and criticism of the team reached its nadir after the loss in the first test against Sri Lanka.
"We showed more belief in our abilities and that we could win from any situation," Kohli said, referring to the victories in the second and third test.
"That really turned our mindset around. From then on you can see the results."
India's preparation has been less than ideal this time, too, with head coach Anil Kumble stepping down last month citing a breakdown in his relationship with skipper Kohli.
Former all-rounder Ravi Shastri was named as head coach last week, while Bharat Arun was appointed bowling coach and Sanjay Bangar was named assistant coach, following Shastri's recommendations.
Shastri said he will approach his role with a fresh mind.
"Mine will be a refresh button that will be pushed and I will carry on from where I left. I don't come with any baggage," the 55-year-old said.
"The team has done exceedingly well over three years and they are the people who deserve the credit more than anybody else. These Ravi Shastris and Anil Kumbles will come and go. The fabric of Indian cricket will remain." - Agencies

'Majority of people are against SAITM: Isura Devapriya

Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said the number of persons who oppose SAITM is higher than the number of persons who support SAITM.
"The President and the Government has paid attention to the issue. It is good to let the Government solve it without interferences of others," he said.
Addressing a press conference at the Western Provincial Council auditorium in Colombo 7 today he said that the Front Line Socialist Party had said that it will bring schoolchildren into the protest against SAITM.
"This is totally wrong and unacceptable. They should not use schoolchildren for their protests. The parents should not let their children to be used by political parties," he said.
He further alleged that it wasBasil Rajapaksa who purposely created the current conflict in the North Central Provincial Council onOctober 02in 2012 in order to defeatformer NCP Chief Ministers Berty Premalal Dissanayake.
"He was a person who had been elected by the UNP at that time, removed by the UNP itself. It is very pathetic to see how Provincial Council MPs dishonored the Mace. The Parliamentarians do not do it, said the Minister. 
Isura Devapriya further said that the current President did not invite anyone to join hands with him and he does not give any perks to anyone in order to keep them with him.
"No one will leave the President as stated in certain media. There are issues in the UNP as well as in the SLFP but nothing serious as shown by media. There were more MPs to join the Government but it was impossible to give the ministerial portfolios asked by them. But still they were waiting to join the Government," he said.

Miles to go before 2018
Political circles were abuzz last week with speculation that a rift between the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and United National Party (UNP) factions of the National Unity government had widened and a parting of ways was imminent.
This followed months of dissatisfaction in both UNP and SLFP camps with President Maithripala Sirisena complaining that corruption probes against the Rajapaksa regime were stalled and reportedly a group of some eighteen SLFP ministers and Members of Parliament wanting to quit government ranks.
There has been intermittent sniping among SLFP and UNP ministers for some time now but it appears that the prospect of upcoming elections - both local government and provincial council - are pushing parliamentarians to take up positions that are popular with the electorates they represent.
At the last SLFP parliamentary group meeting, President Maithripala Sirisena - who was about to embark on an official visit to Bangladesh - gave his SLFP MPs a patient hearing. In the end, he left with some cautionary words of advice: that the SLFP would need to work with the UNP at least until the end of this year.
National Unity government
However, it was evident at the meeting that even within the SLFP, MPs were not speaking in one voice. Even though it was well known by then that President Sirisena was unhappy at the pace of investigations against the Rajapaksa regime, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera was to argue that it was not fair to harass the Rajapaksa family with numerous investigations. This drew angry responses from some of his colleagues.
That the status quo within the National Unity government will remain- at least for the foreseeable future- is clear. In fact, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was to acknowledge that it was difficult but declare that it was necessary.
Addressing a public function at Pannipitiya on Monday, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe noted that the National Unity government was formed so it could initiate development programmes. We could have refrained from doing so but the main parties decided to work together instead, he pointed out and exhorted, let us continue to work together and try to solve the problems faced by the country.
The misgivings about the unity government have arisen because parliamentarians in both parties have no clear idea about the political path the country will take on a variety of issues: the fate of the executive presidency, the prospects for a presidential election and the alliances that would be forged at the next general election.
Executive presidency
The big question amongst all this is the fate of the Executive Presidency. President Maithripala Sirisena is on record, both before and after being elected President, that the 2015 Presidential election was the first and last election he would contest. He also pledged to prune the powers of the Presidency and make the office responsible to Parliament.
To be fair by the President, he has done some of that already, through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which he personally took great pains to see through Parliament, amidst stiff resistance from the Rajapaksa-led Joint Opposition (JO) faction of the SLFP. He has also never publicly opined that he would run again for President.
Nevertheless, some of his loyalists have repeatedly made public announcements that President Sirisena would be the SLFPs candidate for the 2020 Presidential election, the latest coming in the form of a newspaper interview by Minister Duminda Dissanayake. Dissanayake is also the General Secretary of the SLFP and is considered a close confidante of the President.
Thus far, President Sirisena has maintained a dignified silence regarding these statements but that has, in turn, fuelled speculation that he is not averse to the prospect. Others point out that the President is not in the habit of rushing and making statements to the media and his silence should not be construed as tacit acceptance.
In any event, for a presidential election not to be held in 2020, the Constitution will need to be amended or replaced by that time. This is a work in progress but its pace has been quite slow. The mainstream SLFP (or President Sirisenas faction) and the UNP would need to agree on any such changes for it to have a realistic chance of passing through Parliament because only then would a two-thirds majority become viable.
In the current political atmosphere, when the relationship between the UNP and the SLFP is far from ideal, this cannot be taken for granted. It would only be natural for both parties and their parliamentarians to look at their own interests before committing themselves to any changes. Compounding the issue is the Rajapaksa-led Joint Opposition (JO). They are acutely aware that, as long as the current Constitution, with its Executive Presidency, is in force, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa cannot run for the highest office in the land. However, if this is replaced with an Executive Prime Minister, there is no bar to Rajapaksa aspiring for that post.
For the Rajapaksa camp, it is, therefore, a tempting prospect to support the abolition of the Executive Presidency. However, the JO has historically opposed the dilution of executive powers arguing that it weakens the state and if it were to now do an about turn on that policy, it would raise many questions in the minds of the voting public.
As the SLFP struggles to come to terms with its own divisions, the UNP has a different problem. Arguably it is more united than it ever was in its recent history. It is certainly in a position of strength relative to the factional infighting in the SLFP. It also has fewer coalition partners to contend with, compared to the multitude of allies that constitute the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA).
Even so, it still has reason to be concerned. That is because its performance as a government has been below par, hamstrung as it is because it has to deal with the ideological demands of its left of the centre partner in the National Unity government, the SLFP.
With President Sirisena as the Executive President and some key ministries being retained with the SLFP, the UNP has not had a free rein in government. Some of its policies have run into heavy weather from their SLFP colleagues in Cabinet and at times, the chain of command in government has become blurred to such an extent that it has created the impression that no one is in charge.
Legacy from Rajapaksa era
The UNP has reason to be worried because, although the government is not entirely theirs, its lapses and mishaps are being debited to its account. A case in point is the controversy over the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) and the resultant ongoing tussle with the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA).
This issue is a legacy from the Rajapaksa era, UNP ministers argue but the UNP has its hands tied in dealing with it decisively because of several SLFP Ministers - Dayasiri Jayasekara and Susil Premajayantha among them - oppose SAITM. Yet, when there is negative fall-out, the public perception is that UNP Ministers dealing with the issue, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella have mishandled the crisis.
Thus, the UNP too would find it easier to run the government on its own but Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is alive to the political realities of the day. Moreover, he has his sights set on the more important question of constitutional reform which would come to a grinding halt if the UNP and the SLFP were to go their separate ways now.
What is clearer for the UNP is that it has to fight its own electoral battles, come election time. It will contest the Local Government and Provincial polls as one entity and the same holds true for the 2020 general elections and indeed even a presidential election if that ensues. In that sense, its task is much clearer than that of the SLFP which may well have split into two parties by then.
Still, for now, an uneasy calm prevails between the two major parties in the wake of President Maithripala Sirisenas call for peace until the end of the year and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes prompt endorsement of this. Still, they say a week is a long time in politics- and there are many more weeks to come until the end of the year.

National Chamber airs concerns about local insurance industry
The National Chamber has established business clusters covering many business categories. One of the main objectives of a business cluster is looking into the concerns that its industry faces.
As such, the Insurance Committee of the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka has set out its concerns regarding the insurance industry.
The insurance industry's general insurance gross premiums grew by a mere 2.27% in the year on year. This is from Rs. 18,134.34 million in 2016 and Rs. 18,545.26 million as at the first quarter of 2017.
This growth reflects a 4% growth in the motor insurance class of business verses a 0.57 % growth in the non motor class of business.
This, the Chamber feels, is a result of the industry functioning within an uneven playing field, due to the preference for state-owned property and risks being granted exclusively to state-owned insurers.
This has created an unhealthy situation to the industrys growth. If the regulations and circulars providing undue advantages to state-owned insurers are removed, government institutions will have the opportunity of benefiting from a competitive service from the private sector companies, particularly with regard to premium prices and reinsurance security.
This will also result in the service levels of the state-owned companies to be more competitive and the service levels of the entire industry to improve, bringing about product diversification within the industry.
A major concern to the Chamber is that the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation along with a few other insurance companies have not completed the segregation of the Life and Non Life businesses which all insurance companies were required to comply by the regulatory deadline of January 1, 2015.
The split of composite insurance companies was expected to promote greater focus, transparency, policy holder protection and greater visibility on profitability amongst insurance companies.
The Chamber is concerned that the Regulator is yet to implement this requirement in a fair manner, even though these companies claim to have structurally segregated their internal processes. The deadlines for implementing these regulations are far overdue.
The Agrarian Insurance Board was established under Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Act No. 20 of 1999 and does not come within the purview of regulation of Insurance Industry Act No. 43 of 2000.
Hence, the Agrarian Insurance Board was exempted from the Regulation of Insurance Industry (RII) Act of 2000 and is not a licensed insurance company regulated by the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka (IBSL). Therefore, they are not geared to accept liabilities of the public at large.
The Agrarian Insurance Board was established only to support farmers through insuring their agriculture crops and farms, equipment and machinery.
Since of late they are underwriting general insurance policies outside their scope which could have serious consequences when facing liabilities of risks undertaken as they do not have proper reinsurance arrangements. Furthermore, as they have now embarked on providing motor insurance cover, the Chamber is concerned about whether this contravenes the Motor Traffic Act and if the Traffic Police recognize insurance covers for vehicles, particularly with regard to third party liabilities from insurance entities that are not regulated by the IBSL the implementing authority of the RII Act.
Micro insurance companies and similar entities that provide various schemes particularly to underprivileged sections of society is a major concern to the Chamber that these insurance providers are not licensed and regulated, under the umbrella of the IBSL.
The Chamber warns that a serious social issue could arise as a result of default on disbursing claims and maturities in the event of financial collapse of such entities. Insurance companies the world over increasingly work with various platforms such as mobile networks, banks, credit card companies, airline ticketing, etc., to provide the masses easy access to insurance products.
Even in developed markets, the trend is to sell certain categories of insurance products through these networks using various platforms only as distribution channels and the policies are issued and underwritten by the licensed insurers.
This concept is widely known as the 'white labelling' of products, which is legally underwritten by an authorized insurance entity. These products are popular in the Western world and supermarket chains in particular provide over the counter pre-underwritten insurance cover to dwelling houses, pets, personal accident, travel insurance, etc. Local regulations restricting such arrangements should be relaxed and the regulator should understand the need for such products in todays context and the benefits the industry would derive from selling these products.
This could dramatically change the growth scenario of the industry, which still stands at just 1.7% of the GDP in terms of premiums, as well as to provide for product diversification and innovation within the industry to bring about inclusion to a growing segment of convenience-seeking insurance customers.
The Chamber feels that the Regulator should encourage and promote these new developments through its mandate to develop the industry, by leveraging modern technology and catalyse greater product offerings to a wider public to have the opportunity to purchase these products at an affordable price with easy access and convenience.
In conclusion, the Chamber is watching with concern and is observant of the entry of foreign insurance companies to the local market, particularly in terms of the free movement of professionals, which is under scrutiny with the ongoing discussions of ECTA, where the opportunities and placements of Sri Lankan insurance professionals and actuaries could potentially be threatened.
Whereas in other insurance markets, particularly in India, equity requirements are stated for multinational insurance players to participate in their market, Sri Lanka does not have such regulations in place at present.
Whilst welcoming FDIs in the insurance industry, the Chamber would like to see knowledge transfer and access to multinational exposure and placement opportunities being provided to our professionals in the industry.

New Jaguar E-Pace rolls into record books
The new Jaguar E-PACE has set an official Guinness World Records title during its world premiere.
The compact performance SUV leapt into the record books with a 15.3 metre-long jump complete with a 270-degree corkscrew-like barrel roll.
Demonstrating the agility, precision and performance of Jaguars newest SUV, the feat was the final test for E-PACE after 25 gruelling months of work across four continents to ensure extreme durability and that it lived up to Jaguars Art of Performance philosophy.
The Jaguar E-PACE is a five-seat, compact SUV that packs the design and performance of a Jaguar sports car into a spacious, practical and connected all-wheel-drive vehicle.
Trademark Jaguar driving dynamics and design put the brands sports car DNA in a practical design packed with advanced technologies to keep you connected.
The E-PACE is the newest member of Jaguars SUV family, joining the ground-breaking all-electric
I-PACE Concept and the 2017 World Car of the Year, the Jaguar F-PACE itself launched with a spectacular GUINNESS WORLD RECORDS setting loop-the-loop in 2015.
The exterior design is inspired by the Jaguar F-TYPE sports car and characterised by the distinctive Jaguar grille, muscular proportions, short overhangs and powerful haunches that give the E-PACE a bold and purposeful stance, instantly communicating dynamic agility. Jaguar sports car DNA is also evident in the fast sweep of the roofline and the distinctive side window graphic.
Ian Callum, Director of Design, Jaguar, said, Established Jaguar design principles ensure the
E-PACE is immediately recognisable as the sports car of its class. Our new compact SUV combines the interior space, connectivity and security that families expect with the kind of proportions, purity of design and performance not usually associated with such a practical vehicle. Guinness World Records adjudicator Pravin Patel said: This amazing feat really was a sight to behold. While Ive seen the barrel roll stunt in film, witnessing this incredible feat in real life was something pretty special. Congratulations to Terry and Jaguar for setting another epic Guinness World Records title.
Pete Tong said, I have been working with the Heritage Orchestra for the past couple of years but this is the first time I've been involved in something like this, it's very exciting and I'm glad to be apart of it! Jaguar breaking the Guinness World Record for the barrel roll was mind-blowing. This creative approach to revealing the new Jaguar E-PACE was the inspiration behind the collaboration between myself and Raye and we are now planning to put the track on my new album.

Five Parliamentarians of the National Freedom Front (NFF) yesterday, informed the Speaker in writing that they will be leaving the Constitutional Assembly.
The five NFF parliamentarians who were elected to Parliament after contesting under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) yesterday, handed over their letter to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya informing that they will be leaving the Constitutional Assembly.
The parliamentarians leaving are NFF Leader MP Wimal Weearawansa and Weerakumara Dissanayake, Jayantha Samaraweera, Udayashantha Gunasekara and Niroshan Premaratne.
In their letter, the MPs have mentioned ten reasons as to why they decided to leave the Constitutional Assembly and they have also mentioned that all representatives of the party unanimously agreed with this decision.
They urged the Speaker to inform Parliament that their departure would challenge the validity of the Constitutional Assembly, since it has breached one condition of the proposal passed in Parliament that the Constitutional Assembly should consist of all the 225 Parliamentarians.
In their letter, NFF MPs have mentioned that the NFF accept the joint statement made by the Bhikkus of three Nikayas claiming that there was no need to bring in a new Constitution. They also informed that the peoples mandate has not been received by the 95 joint opposition members to bring amendments to the Constitution and Parliament has no special majority to do so.

NMA, striving for excellence 50 years of moulding Officers and Sailors
Seafaring is a unique skill and a resplendent art only brave men can accomplish. Naval activities, is said to date back thousands of years, to 8200 BC.
The Sri Lanka Navy is believed to be the only Navy in the world in the recent past, that fought a ruthless terrorist organisation and defeated the LTTE, which possessed a well-developed militia and carried out many high-profile attacks.
Where were the personnel of the Sri Lanka Navy trained to acquire discipline to such an extent
It is none other than the Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) in Trincomalee which celebrates the completion of fifty years in service. It has been the Alma Mater to almost all the Naval Officers and the Sailors in the Sri Lanka Navy.
History of the NMA
Although the Naval and Maritime Academy, is situated in the picturesque and warm Naval Dockyard bordered by the Trincomalee natural harbour in the Eastern Coast at present, its roots run up to chilly Diyathalawa, a former garrison town in the central highlands of Sri Lanka.
The Sri Lanka Navy we have today was created at first as the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force (CNVF) in January, 1938. Three years later, the CNVF was accepted by the Royal Navy (RN) of Great Britain, as a Volunteer Reserve and renamed as Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve, or CRNVR. After Independence from British rule in 1948, the government believed an island nation should possess a strong Navy to be its first line of defence. Therefore, on December 9,1950 the Royal Ceylon Navy was created. Later, in 1972, the Dominion of Ceylon became the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka and the Royal Ceylon Navy became the Sri Lanka Navy. Finally, Her Majestys Ceylon Ships (H.M.Cy.S.) became Sri Lanka Navy Ships (SLNS).
Early history
In 1965, HMCyS Parakrama II was established in Naval Dockyard, Trincomalee to conduct recruit training whilst HMCyS Tissa was providing the administrative support.
It was in 1966 that vital awareness of maritime aspects came up. Its paramount significance and value began to surface in order to have a proper formal Naval training academy. The Dockyard in Trincomalee of all places was decided the most apposite location and swiftly the massive task of designing, planning and creating an institute was initiated. The Instructor Commander M.G.S. Perera was entrusted to shoulder the proceedings. He was not only assigned the strenuous task of transforming the old neglected buildings at Dockyard but also to give life to an Academy to achieve this goal.
The outcome was the birth of Naval and Maritime Academy, the NMA on January 15, 1967. It turned out to be the vital beginning to a long journey ahead.
NMA was then formally commissioned on July 15, 1967. Since then, it trained not only generations of officers and sailors of the Navy but personnel from Fisheries Corporation, Police Department and also Merchant Navy Cadets for the Ceylon Shipping Corporation. Many of those then trained at NMA went to sea with NMA Certificates.
When the Naval and Maritime Academy was formally commissioned on July 15th, 1967 there were only five departments; Nautical, Engineering, Electrical, Communication and Supply Department.
Course made good
The nautical school was created under four pillars namely Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare, Seamanship and Navigation. Over the last five decades, the Naval and Maritime Academy has expanded and improved its facilities and capability to meet the dimensions of the Navys requirement to internationally accepted standards.
The first recruit batch and the first officer cadet batch were trained at NMA in 1968 and 1969 respectively. Beginning from the first intake, training of officer cadets and other officer under trainees came under the aegis of the Nautical school which was responsible for training of recruits, as well as for conducting training on Nautical science including Navigation, Seamanship, Gunnery and Underwater warfare for all officer under trainees and sailors following advanced courses. With the expansion of the Navy which resulted in frequent and larger intakes of officers, as well as the paucity of foreign berths for Sub Lieutenant Technical Courses, the number of Officer Under Trainees (OUTs) at NMA increased exponentially, and so did the training courses for trainees. Therefore, the Nautical school found it difficult to meet the training needs in an efficient and effective manner, and the Navy decided to establish a separate unit within the NMA soley to conduct and coordinate all training matters pertaining to OUTs . The Officer Training Wing was set up for this purpose in 1990.
With this, the disintegration of the Nautical school in to the specializations of Gunnery, Anti-Submarine Warfare and Seamanship and Navigation along with the language and Computer department came in to being. As at today, there are 22 schools and 02 training supporting units in the Naval & Maritime Academy to conduct its training, and has the capacity to train 2000 trainees including both officers and sailors. NMA currently conducts Sub Lieutenant Technical Courses for Executive, Logistics, NPM and Provost branch officers, in addition to training of Officer Under Trainees of Cadet Entry, KDU Entry and Direct Entry (Degree holders) and Service Entry.
The training facilities and infrastructure was uplifted recently to meet the modern day international standards. The new building complex was added to the NMA training facilities by June 2015 and the building complex encompasses Seamanship, Anti- Submarine Warfare, Navigation, Merchant Marine Training, Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering, Provost, Physical Training , English and Information Technology Schools. These three storeyed buildings are equipped with required facilities to impart training in order to achieve the Navys vision to enhance the training quality and capacity. The building complex has spacious multi class rooms, Navigation Bridge Simulator, Chart rooms, Model rooms, Practical rooms and state-of-the art Technological, Computer and Language laboratories. Further, the new facility has administration spaces in par with international standards.
The motto The disciplined are the noblest of men is conceptually leading the institution to the exact target. Accomplishments of Sri Lanka Navy over the past decades bear testimony to the effective quality of training imparted on those who walked through the portals of the Academy.
Courses conducted at NMA
Having a Navy proper is of a boundless importance for our island nation. Building up such a Navy means building up individuals to be Naval personnel to achieve perfection or rather close perfection. It is not an overnight task and needs numerous attributes to cater to that. The future Navy is built here at the academy with a clear vision and perfect mission. Thus the NMAis conducting many pre-service and in-service courses. The training for Naval ratings encompasses courses for phase III (branch qualifying course) and advanced training comprised of branch training, specialization training, mechanical and technical training. NMA also conducts specialized training courses for the Sri Lanka Army, Sri Lanka Air Force, Sri Lanka Police and civil institutions such as Ceylon Shipping Corporation and Fisheries Corporation from time to time when requested.
Officer Training Wing (OTW) is the heart of the Academy. It provides basic officer training for newly joined cadets and all types of entries. The Cadet Entry training was accredited to the esteemed University of Kelaniya in the year 2001, and at present is accredited to the General sir John Kotelawala Defence University since 2011 for the award of BSc degrees.
At NMA, twenty-two separate schools and three departments have been established to teach various subjects related to Naval warfare. Naval subjects such as Seamanship, Navigation, Gunnery, Communication and Anti-Submarine Warfare are taught in different schools. Technical subjects such as Engineering, Electrical and Electronic Engineering are taught to all the officer-under-trainees and sailors in the relevant branches. The Civil Engineering school was established recently to conduct basic and advanced training courses for sailors in the Civil Engineering Branch.
Supply and Secretariat School conducts basic and advanced courses for Stores Assistants, Writers, Mess Assistants and Catering Assistants. The Diving School conducts basic and advanced courses for sailors of the diving branch and basic diving module for Officer Under Trainees. The combat diving courses are conducted for Sri Lanka Navy Special Boats Squadron, Sri Lanka Army Commandos and Special Forces. Physical Training School conducts Qualifying and Advanced Courses for Physical Training Instructors for various sports disciplines.
In order to train the young trainees to take up challenges both at sea and on land, the Combat Training Unit, Marksmanship and Sniper Training School and Provost and Regulating School were established. English Language Teaching School, General Education Department and Information Technology School work in order to mould Navys young generation into a professional force with effective communication ability.
One of the greatest achievements of the Academy was the inauguration of Merchant Marine Training School. The naval personnel, who wish to join the merchant ships after their retirement from the Navy follow these courses conducted here and obtain an internationally recognised certificate. The fully-fledged Nuclear Biological Chemical Defense, Damage Control and Fire-fighting School gives practical training on fire-fighting and damage control to secure their safety at daily Naval routine.
The Long Logistics Management Course is the most advanced course conducted at the NMA leading to an MBA degree. It is accredited to the Kotelawala Defence University.
With the view of maintaining high standards in staff duties, NMA conducts the Junior Naval Staff Course (JNSC).
Milestones, eventsand achievements
NMA was awarded with Presidential colours in 2003 in recognition of her yeoman service rendered to the nation.
The Naval and Maritime Academy is the first military training institute that was awarded with the International Quality Management Certification ISO 9001: 2000 by the Sri Lanka Standards Institution in the year 2007, and it was upgraded to ISO 9001: 2008 in the year 2010, and ISO 9001:2015 in the year 2016.
Certain sailor training courses conducted at the Academy, have been recognized by the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission for the award of National Vocational Qualification Level 3 and 4. (NVQ)
Facilities and opportunities
The NMA is full of treasured resources including an auditorium and a mini auditorium. The air-conditioned main auditorium is of 642 seating capacity and equipped with state-of-the-art light and dolby sound system including multimedia facilities. The air conditioned mini auditorium can accommodate 77 personnel.
The central library possesses a rare and fine collection of 21,000 books to enrich the knowledge of trainees as well as trainers. The academy is also equipped with a tilting damage control simulator for NBCD department, a modern ship-handling simulator and a Small Arms Firing Simulator.
The NMA possesses not only modern training facilities, but also modern sports facilities for tennis, golf, volleyball, basketball, cricket, handball, boxing, rugby, football, hockey, archery, sailing and rowing. In addition, there are indoor courts for badminton and table tennis and an air conditioned squash court. The swimming pool is of international standards. The fully equipped gymnasium consists of a power gym, a cardiac gym and a yoga room. All these facilities are maintained well to encourage trainees to maintain their physical fitness standards as required by the Navy.
Destination excellence
The NMA always makes sure that she moulds officers and sailors to be professionals to meet the excellence, that will undoubtedly enable them to face future challenges.
The NMA serves the nation inaudibly, by creating both warriors and professionals at sea for the Navy, the golden fence around the country.
There are many training institutions in the Navy today, but the Academy stands tall above all of them, the first and the best.

No bridge to cross Galathura Ganga from Kalawana
Residents of Pahala Galathura and Sinhalagoda in Kalawana are inconvenienced due to the lack of a bridge across Galathura Ganga to enable them attend to their work and market places.
They said, they had to cross the river with the help of a raft which is both, cumbersome and daunting during high-tide.
They had made representations over the matter since 1993, but all their appeals had fallen on deaf ears. At least a suspension bridge would do to tide over their present problem.
When Disaster Management Deputy Minister Dunesh Gankande was contacted over the matter, he said, steps would be taken to build two suspension bridges over the river.

Over 3 mn Mercedes-Benz cars recalled over emissions
Daimler has announced a voluntary recall of more than 3 million Mercedes-Benz vehicles in Europe amid mounting questions over its diesel engines.
The automaker said Tuesday that it was offering European owners a service upgrade that would improve diesel emissions. It will cost the company around 220 million euros ($255 million).
The public debate about diesel engines is creating uncertainty, CEO Dieter Zetsche said in a statement. We have therefore decided on additional measures to reassure drivers of diesel cars and to strengthen confidence in diesel technology.
Customers will not be charged for the upgrade.
Daimler (DDAIF) also announced that it had created a new line of diesel engines whose exemplary emissions have been confirmed by measurements carried out by independent institutes. The new diesel engine would be introduced rapidly across the companys entire model portfolio, it added.
Daimler was summoned by the German government last week to appear before a commission after local media reported that prosecutors were investigating possible cheating on emissions tests. (CNN)

Pan Asia Bank offers ultimate low interest credit card solutions
Following the directive of the Central Bank to lift the maximum interest rate cap on credit cards, Pan Asia Banks DGM Marketing and Personal Banking, Nalaka Wijayawardana, shared his views on the way forward for Pan Asia Bank credit cards and how the bank plans to fulfill the role as the Understanding Bank in midst of the recent developments.
Q: Could you tell us more about the journey Pan Asia Bank has embarked on over the last 2 decades
A: Within a short span of two years, we have successfully established ourselves in the hearts of our customers as a bank that understands their true needs. Further solidifying this perception Pan Asia Bank in 2015 decided to change its brand promise to be the Understanding Bank. Staying true to this promise, we have been able to understand and anticipate the needs of our valued customers and provide innovative solutions to meet their requirements in all spheres of banking.
Q: How has your product development strategy contributed towards the banks overall brand promise
A: In view of understanding the customer needs, we have come up with many a novel product such as Sammana, a loan scheme for retired pensioners, Suwasavi a deposit product providing a free family medical insurance cover and the Champions saver deposit scheme that provides the flexibility of a savings account and gives the high interest rates of a Fixed Deposit. In future also, we will continue to focus on developing new products to meet the customer needs.
Q: Your retail products have indeed been highly successful pertaining to the objective of establishing your bank as the Understanding Bank. How successful have your credit card facilities been in achieving this
A: Pan Asia Bank currently offers three different Credit card types catering to different segments in the market and we pride ourselves as a bank offering some of the lowest industry interest rates ranging from 19.75% for Pan Asia Black MasterCard, 21.75% for Pan Asia Gold MasterCard and 24% for Pan Asia World MasterCard.
This low interest proposition has been well accepted by the market and our market share has grown substantially from being less than 0.5% in 2013 to around 4% in the current quarter.
These figures showcase how successful we have been in overcoming the challenges presented to us as a midsized bank operating in a highly competitive industry. Instead of being limited by these challenges, we have capitalized on our main forte which is innovating novel products that align with the customer requirements.
Q: Recently, the Central Bank announced its decision to lift the ceiling on interest rates. Following this, many banks have now declared that they will charge an interest rate of around 28%. In light of these changes, what will be the strategy for Pan Asia Bank
A: We do understand that due to the increasing cost of funds, banks need the space to revisit their lending rates. However, as a bank that takes pride in positioning itself as the Understanding Bank, we are trying our level best to minimize the difficulties faced by customers due to rate increases. Hence, with regard to our credit cards, in spite of having the ceiling on interest rates uplifted, we are staying true to our brand of promise and keeping our cards as low interest credit cards although that is going to cost us an additional profit opportunity.
Therefore, we will continue to operate as a low interest credit card and take every measure to ease the burden on our customers in light of these changes.
Q: Does this mean customers can continue to avail your Balance Transfer arrangements at a lower rate than what your competitor banks are offering
A: Certainly. This is exactly what our proposition is. In fact, customers can still transfer their other bank credit card balances to a Pan Asia Bank credit card at a rate as low as 16%. We will continue to offer the best value for our customers in terms of attractive seasonal promotions and special discounts whilst at the same time enjoying the benefits of the lowest interest rates in the market.
Pertaining to the increased interest rates, our Balance Transfer facility is expected to ease 40% off on their interest charges. Further, our Balance Transfer Installment Plans allow the cardholders to pay off their accumulated credit card debt in full over specific time period under the lowest of interest rates.
Q: Can you elaborate more on the Benefits that are offered to your customers through the Bank Transfer Facility
A: Our Balance Transfer facility is designed in such that our cardholders can transfer their existing Credit Card Balances to Pan Asia Bank Credit card without additional charges.
They can then decide to pay off the amount in either specific monthly installments or in varying monthly amounts that suits their monthly cash flows. Either way, our customers are given the opportunity to settle the credit card debts under a significantly lower interest rate.
Q: Can you explain the application procedure for this facility
A: In order to apply, customers can simply visit their nearest Pan Asia Bank Branch and submit a completed Balance Transfer application along with a Pan Asia Bank Credit Card application as well as the required support documents including the latest credit card statements. More information can be obtained by visiting any of the Bank branches island wide, visiting our web site www.pabcbank.com (VW)

The production cost was around Rs 10,000. It can be used to detect mosquitoes at a height of about 20 feet.
However the instrument had no recording facility. He could further develop with novel features if some person or institution came forward to assist him. He said the instrument has easy mobility as it could be hung on the shoulder. Galle Municipal Commissioner Ranil Wickremasekara and the MoH and several other PHIs were present on the occasion.

President seeks Cabinet nod for State Dept. grant to empower CIABOC
President Maithripala Sirisena this week sought Cabinet approval to obtain a grant of USD 235,000 (35.25 million) from the US State Department to empower the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery and Corruption (CIABOC).
Cabinet granted approval for the signing of a MoU with the Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labour of the US State Department.
CIABOC has often cited lack of resources and personnel to carry out investigations into the large number of complaints it has received and the grant will help in computerizing its systems and in the training of personnel.
Statistics show that from 2000-2015, the Commission received a total of 41,810 complaints and the Commission so far has completed investigations into 31,176 and has 10,634 complaints either pending or being investigated into. In 2016 alone, it received another 3450 complaints which need to be investigated into.
The Commission, the Presidents Cabinet Paper noted did not have sufficient technical equipment available to speed up these investigations and it was necessary that the knowledge of the Investigation Officers and Legal Officers be updated and their skills honed to keep abreast with the developments in the field.
The government has thus asked that the US Agency provide the grant to enhance efficiency through the computerization of dossier management system (Rs. 13,500,000), improve the exchange of information between the public and the Commission and vice versa through the updating of the Commissions website (Rs 1,500,000), conducting raids and investigations more effectively by the use of advanced technological equipment (Rs. 7,500,000), being able to conduct complex investigations more correctly and efficiently through a code of guidelines under implementation as a handbook and strengthening the legal process (Rs. 7,500,000) and capacity building of the investigation officers and upgrading of knowledge and attitudes of legal officers through training programmes (Rs. 5,250,000).
The State Department through an open procurement process has chosen the East West Management Institute as the Agency that will provide the grant through.

Race ready!
If fast cars set your pulse racing, imaging being behind the wheel of one of them on the race track. While some may make it look easy, becoming a race car driver is anything but simple. Countless drivers take to the race tracks from across the world, yet only a few ever make it to the big time.
Jaden and Aaron Gunawardena are two of Sri Lankan motorsports brightest prospects. They have taken a less travelled path in the Sri Lankan sports arena at such a tender age. The two boys who are 15 and 14 year olds and schooling at Gateway College, Negombo, haven taken on the race track with professional riders from countries like Japan, Thailand, India, Philippines, Indonesia and Taiwan. Not only have they competed head to head with racers who are almost twice their age but they have emerged as winners in the FIM Asia Cup 2015 .
Born with racing in their blood, the duo notes that they have ridden motorcycles before even riding a bicycle! This is not surprising because they are the sons of inaugural Foxhill Supercross champion rider Shane Gunawardena. Jadens first motorcycle was given to him for his second birthday. As soon as the boys have mastered the techniques of riding their mini motorcycles they switched to competitive 50cc bikes.
Our Dad inspired us to take to motorcycle racing. We were around five years when we first took to the race track. We have photos to remind us about what we did and where we were placed but there have just been too many races after that. So we cannot really recall how we felt during our first race, Jaden and Aaron said.
They note that their passion for the sport grew as they honed their talent. Shane, too saw immense potential behind his sons and he entered them for the National Championships in Road Racing when they were seven and eight years old. This turned out to be an eye opener for many as the two young boys beat top adult riders to clinch the National Championships in 2010.
Jaden was selected for the national pool to represent Sri Lanka at the age of eight. His first tournament was in India. Both boys represented Sri lanka at an Asian round in Japan in 2011. They created history by being the youngest riders to participate at a 150cc championship in Asia. Their most significant win was winning the 2015 Asia Cup in a three round championship among eight countries.
Jaden managed to win the first race of the Round One of the ACRR in Motegi, Japan, in August 2015. However he met with a nasty crash and had to be airlifted out of the circuit concussed and with a fractured collarbone during the second race. Then it was all up to the then 12 year old Aaron to withstand the pressure and bring home the trophy. He managed to do this with glowing colours as he steered Sri Lanka to victory in the opening round. Moving onto the second round which was held in Nakhonchaisri Circuit, Thailand, in October, 2015, Jaden and Aaron went in with a few Injuries which occurred during practice and finished off by clinching sixth and seventh places.
Round three of the ACRR was held at Pen Bay International Circuit, Taiwan, on bikes somewhat similar to international racing 250cc bikes. The boys recalled that they had never ridden bikes of this nature before. However they did not back off from the challenge and their victory was truly a sight to behold as they took to the race track and zoomed past the finish line.
With experience gathered overseas the youth found it easy to become national champs. They were podium finishes at the Kandy and Colombo night races too.
Our Dad did our basic training. He leased out properties to make practice tracks for us to train on when we were young. Now that we have reached the Asian level, he has leased out the Mirigama circuit and had it blocked out to use for motorcyclists alone. We would love to practice every day like the professionals, but the school work takes a lot of our time. Priority is always for our studies and sports and fitness come in second, they explained.
Queried if they did not think twice about the dangers of the sport when they decided to pursue it on the long run, the boys said that they have never contemplated the matter a few years ago. However time and experience has taught them otherwise and now that they are much older and had seen fatal accidents occurring before their eyes, they ride with more caution.
Our greatest achievement is being able to keep up with the riders at an Asian level. We would need to put in a lot of hard work to keep abreast, and even more if we are looking at podiums. Seeing our countrys national flag on a podium has been our goal. We have had many memorable moments where our country was highlighted during our overseas tours. We have also learnt quite a lot from better riders and their coaches during these events, Jaden and Aaron said.
Their favourite sports idol is Italian professional road racer Valentino Rossi because he is the greatest of all time.
Jadens talent has been spotted by Red Bull Sri Lanka who supported him to earn a spot at the Red Bull Rookies Cup where he was one of two Asians who competed. They have also shown interest in grooming Jaden and Aaron to become one of the first Sri Lankans to participate in the global MotoGP Series.
We had dreams of MotoGP and going international, but in reality a Sri Lankan with average support cannot make it there. We have one last chance to have a go at it internationally and that would be through this years world selection at the Red Bull Rookies Cup in Spain, Jaden and Aaron said adding that they do not have proper facilities like circuits and support from the manufacturers to take their talents to the global level.
We also do not have an insurance that covers racing. So basically there are many hurdles and hardships for our local riders, they lamented.
Their words of advice for other youth are to stay off the addictive mobile phones and focus on what they want to do. However, they note with smirks, that they themselves have a hard time practicing what they preach.

The real SLFP  UNP MOU
In recent weeks, there has been quite a lot of political discussion on the topic of the political alliance of the two main political parties in the country, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) and the United National Party (UNP), which has joined hands to form the national unity government we have today. Some members of the government have voiced their frustrations over the alliance and are threatening to leave, while the senior political leadership is seeking to preserve the rainbow coalition which formed the Yahapalanaya Government in 2015. The current focus of the debate seems to the MOU between the SLFP and the UNP, which is currently only until December 2017, while the term of the government itself stretches on till 2020.
Presidential election results of January 2015
Any members of the Government who focus too strongly on an MOU between two political parties as the sole criteria for a national government are forgetting the cardinal rule of constitutional governance. Firstly, the Sri Lankan constitution clearly states that the people of Sri Lanka are sovereign and we exercise our sovereignty very directly through periodic elections. In the Presidential elections of January 2015, the people clearly and convincingly elected Maithripala Sirisena as President of the Republic and with it thereby, as Head of State, Head of Government and Commander in Chief of the Armed Forces.
The people elected a common candidate, a unity figure, the head of a rainbow coalition and gave a mandate for the common programme of the common candidate. During the presidential election campaign, then Common candidate Sirisena, gave a very solemn and public undertaking, to appoint Ranil Wickremesinghe as Prime Minister. In fact, when D.M. Jayaratne refused to resign following the presidential election result, it was president elect Sirisena who was the most insistent that Ranil Wickremesinghe is sworn in as Prime Minister, right after his own swearing in, which historical events occurred almost poetically on Independence Square one late evening in January 2015.
General Election and the concurrent mandate
During the general election campaign of August 2015, President Sirisena gave another Solomon undertaking that he would not appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister, even if the UPFA won, which it did not, the UNP prevailing at the general elections. The fact that the National Democratic Front rainbow alliance which won the election for Maithripala Sirisena in January 2015 contested the general election through its or as distinctive constituent parties, does not in any way negate the mandate received by President Sirisena in January 2015.
When we examine the mandate received by the UNP in August 2015, it is equally clear, that the UNP committed to a continuation of the unity government and the programme of the rainbow coalition, with a fleshed out and detailed economic reform policy, which is seen as their unique selling point. The Joint Opposition section of the SLFP has tended to argue that they never received a mandate to work as part of the unity government, but they ignore two important facts.
Firstly, it is their party leader, President Sirisena, who is leading the unity government and doing so through a direct mandate of the people. When the SLFP accepted Maithripala Sirisena as SLPF party leader, post the presidential election and after the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa, their reason for doing so was that Maithripala Sirisena was indeed president, the SLFP constitution mandating that any member, in the event of being elected president became the leader of the party. In doing so, the SLFP also accepted the responsibility of supporting President Sirisena in that endeavour and role.
Secondly, that any mandate at the general election does not negate the mandate of the presidential, which they chose to support for the duration of that mandate. The UNP as the party which received a mandate at the general election has decided that the two parties should work together for the duration of their respective terms of office. There is a concurrent operation of twin mandates and the two mandates are aligned together and mandated by the sovereign people of Sri Lanka. That is the real basis for the national unity government. No party politics or partisan interests could or should trump the popular mandate of the people.
Delivering on the current mandate
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is currently on public record stating that the alliance of the two major parties is a must for the countrys progress and development. It is fairly clear, that the next generation of economic reforms, addressing the effects and causes of the war and strengthening and solidifying democratic freedoms and institutions requires a degree of consensus between the two main political parties in the country.
Frankly, it is surprising that so far before a national election, either presidential or parliamentary, that political parties seem highly focused on the national elections of 2020. Some sections of the opposition seem focused on the local government elections and thats fine. It is natural for opposition parties to be wanting to regularly campaign and keep things on the boil.
However, the people of Sri Lanka are much more likely to be focused on what the government elected and mandated in 2015 are doing to better their lives and improve their future. The easy gains of 2015/16 are now behind and the hard work of the mid-term needs to be attended to. Economic, democratic and reconciliation reforms should be the agenda of the government and not the opposition agenda of a premature focus on the elections of 2020.

Report will not divide country: PM
Initial report on new Constitution in Parliament soon:
An initial report on the proposed new Constitution is now being formulated to be presented to Parliament for discussion. It is not a report that would divide the country. Neither is it a report of the majority or a minority. It will only be a basis for further discussion and debate, which the Constitutional Council can take into account in formulating the final draft, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister added that during the period of the conflict, they first thought of finding a political solution to the communal problem through a new Constitution. That was not done because the introduction of a new Constitution would not find a solution to the problem during a time of war.
First of all, mutual understanding had to be created among communities. Now that unity and understanding had been created among communities, they had gained an opportunity to work on a new Constitution, he said. The Prime Minister expressed these sentiments participating in the launch of the book Sri Lankawe Janathawa (People in Sri Lanka) published by the National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Ministry held at the BMICH Colombo on July 18.
The Prime Minister said for the first time after the war, they are trying to move forward with all communities under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena. Their version of politics was not based on communalism or religionism.
Instead, their objective was to govern the country with an economic, political and social vision. Their intention was to steer the country forward devoid of conflict.
When they took over the reins of the government under the leadership of President Sirisena, no one thought that they would be able to create a salutary environment in the country. Some expressed doubt whether solutions could be found within a short period of two to three years in a country which suffered from 30 years of war, now that they had proved it was possible through concrete action.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the local government election would be held without delay after amending the election system in a manner acceptable to all because all parties disagreed with the system formulated by the previous regime.
Although the new system would be 100 percent acceptable to all, people should be given an opportunity to exercise their franchise in a fruitful manner.
Referring to Minister Mano Ganesan, the Prime Minister said Ganesan had always fought for communal and religious amity. As such, he had the best credentials to take charge of building national unity and co-existence.

Riu Sri Lanka: For families and friends
Excerpts from Thanzyl Thajudeens interview with RIU Sri Lanka General Manager, Giorgio Chiarel
Q: What inspired RIU to choose Sri Lanka for its firstresort in the Asian region
Weve been in the family holiday business for several decades with an important presence in Europe, the Caribbean, Mexico, Central America and North Africa. It felt like a definite must to expand into the diversified Asian market. After much research we strongly believed Sri Lanka to be the ideal destination for our first hotel in Asia. Sri Lanka is known all over the world as the pearl of the continent and the country certainly does fulfill all the characteristics of a very good tourism destination. It has a rich history in tourism and is experiencing a significant yearly growth in the industry. The island has lovely weather, a varied landscape, blissful nature, wildlife, mountains, beaches, waterfalls and rivers, natural parks, jungles, ancient historic sites, beach sports, adventures and so much more. Not to forget the wonderful, welcoming and charming people. Having been to many countries, I personally believe that Sri Lanka is a perfect holiday destination. You have everything here!
The key to our hotels is the philosophy of service provided by our employees.

## Title: Royal Royalist RODRIGO was a rare breed

## Date: Thursday, July 20, 2017 - 01:00
Royal Royalist RODRIGO was a rare breed
In my previous column on great wicket keepers AKA as (stumpers), I featured BEN NAVARATNE and TELUS FERNANDOPULLE and mentioned that their ilks are not made but in the manner born.
This week I take readers down memory lane and on one of three more stumpers in MAHES RODRIGO. H.I.K. FERNANDO and RANJIT FERNANDO will follow. The trio were magnetic and like the two mentioned earlier they could have gloved for any world team.
Stumpers are specialists. All coaches of school and clubs would drill it into their captains that to get an insight as to how the wicket was behaving or playing was to seek the advice of the wicket keepers because they could read the wicket and advice the captain which bowler to bring on.
I had the fortune of coming under that great coach when I captained St. Benedicts College in 1960 - BERTIE WIJESINHA. And he would insist that I consult the wicket keeper at all times who at that time was ALLAN GUNESEKERA looking every inch like former West Indian wicket keeper CLYDE WALCOTT aspiring to be in that class.
Rodrigo a Royal Royalist
To get back to former wicket keepers and I open with MAHESHA RODRIGO. RODRIGO a royal Royalist as they come was in addition to his excellent work with the gloves was a punishing opening batsman for Royal, Sinhalese Sports Club and All Ceylon as the representative team was then known.
To add to his cricketing feather in the cap, he studded another feather that of being a double international which was a rare breed in the 1940s and 1950s. As a ruggerite, RODRIGO was a master scrum half playing first for his school and then CR and FC and then captaining All Ceylon.
Ruggerite RODRIGO had the alacrity to get to the ball in a flash off as a scrum and pass the ball accurately to his stand off Ago Paiva who would set the line into poetic motion to score and win matches with ease. RODRIGO led his school and the country at rugby.
Cricketer RODRIGO played for the country from 1949 to 1952 and is best known and remembered for the unbeaten 135 he made opening the innings against the West Indies before running short of partners facing the ferocious pace of Prior Jones and John Trim.
Double international
The short and stocky RODRIGO with curly locks played 12 first class matches against Pakistan, West Indies, Commonwealth X1 and Marleyborne Cricket Club. He also had the rare opportunity of playing against Sir Don Bradmans mighty 1947/48 team in a whistle stop game making a stylish 26. RODRIGO certainly deserved the double international honour.
Talking of the Marleybone Cricket Club brings to mind the fun poked at them by the then Sports Editor of the Daily Mirror the incomparable LawfordMartinus when seeing former England batting great Ken Barrington acting the clown on the field and not taking the game seriously was forced to poke fun and tag them the Marleybourne Cricket Clowns. In fun no doubt. I had the good fortune of coming under Martinus as a junior reporter.
When he fronted up to Bradmans 1948 Australians RODRIGO could not keep wickets because Ben Navaratne stood behind. It is on record that RODRIGO fielding in the country took a spectacular catch to dismiss Sam Loxton which came in for high praise from former Aussie cricketer turned journalist Jack Fingleton.
Fingleton wrote thus: RODRIGO made a really great catch to dismiss Loxton in the outfield. probably RODRIGO found it difficult to sight the ball at first against the dark background but he brilliantly retrieved this initial error of judgement by taking a grand overhead catch in true baseball fashion. After watching him bat, Fingleton wrote:  RODRIGO began to bat as if there was not the slightest venom in the Australian attack.
Very attractive batsman
He is a very attractive batsman,he uses his feet smartly to get into position and his bat is impeccably straight in defence. He is a good model for the young to follow.especially as he does not hesitate to give the loose ball all it deserves, wrote Fingleton.
According to my former colleague the late Bernie Wijesekera in a tribute paid to the great sportsman on his demise said that, RODRIGO played cricket under the brilliant and crafty Derrick de Saram in the company of classy players like RusselHeyn, SargoJayawckrema, IversGunesekera, R..L..deKrester, S.Nagendra, V.G. Prins, M.Sathasivam, Bertie Wijesinha, SathiCoomaraswamy, Ben Navaratne, Malcolm Spittle, Lucien de Zoysa and C.V. Abayasekera to name a few..
Wijesekera further stated that RODRIGO never demanded respect but commanded it,which he duly received from everyone who was associated with him.His 80th birthday was celebrated in style at the 80 club
In the midst of the gathering,shining out were golden oldies Bertie Wijesinha, and wife Doreen, Ian Pieris, and his wife Gunn, GaminiSalgadoe the 1942 Royal cricket captain, Summa Navaratnam,yet another die-hard old Royalist,also a ruggerite and once renowned as Asias faster sprinter and IfthikaCader to name a few.
Grand occasion
Joining him on this grand occasion were his charges U,L.Kaluarachchi, VijayaMalalasekera, Shaw Wilson, Chanaka de Silva, Malik Samarawickrema, JagathFernando,SusanthaRatnayake, DhammikaWedande, Ray de Silva, NalinPattikirikorale, Ana Wimaladharma, Dr. Fred Pereira and other vintage cricketers and ruggerites. RODRIGO passed away at the age of 84.
RODRIGO won his colours at cricket when just 16. He started off hoping to be a fast bowler. However it was destined that he be a wicket keeper. RODRIGO was made captain of Royal in his third year and one of his memorable achievements was when he captained the school to a one-run victory against Trinity. His captaincy came in for high praise. In the 1946 Royal-Thomian his batting was flawless although making scores of 48 and 35 not out.
It was not long before he sported SSC colours playing under Derrick de Saram. In one game SSC batsmen made merry making 530 for 2 in 1947 and RODRIGO made his first,first class century in. that game which saw four centuries, He scoring the first followed by de Saram, IversGunasekera and Bertie Wijesingha.
RODRIGO was a rare breed indeed.

Galle Provincial High Court Judge M.U.Gunawardana ordered to lay by six revision applications submitted to him seeking a review of a Galle Magistrate Court order endorsing legal authority of Police to execute legal action under the Excise Ordinance of Sri Lanka.
The High Court Judge issued the order in consideration of a submission by State Counsel Kanishka Rajakaruna. He said similar legal matters were being argued in the Appeal Court under Case No. C/A/M.L./R.B./9/17 and pleaded that proceedings of the cases be laid by until the verdict of the Appeal Court case is delivered.
Galle Chief Magistrate A.Nishantha Peiris earlier had asserted that the Police Department is empowered to initiate legal proceedings before a Magistrate Court connected to liquor and beer related cases. The magistrate made the affirmation when he delivered a retained order regarding objections challenging the legal empowerment of police to prosecute offenders of liquor related violations.

Skidmore, Owings & Merrill will design centre of Sri Lankas $15bn Port City

Major US architect Skidmore, Owings & Merrill (SOM) has won a three-horse race to design the centre of Sri Lankas controversial, Chinese backed Port City of Colombo.
The competition was held to gather design concepts for the financial district and the marina area of the port, which Sri Lankas government hadpreviously suspendedamid concern over undue influence from China and irregularities in the contract process.
Now back on, the port is expected to have an initial investment demand of $1.5bn, rising to $15bn upon completion of all its phases.
The other two designers were Nikken Sekkei of Japan and San Franciscos Gensler, presently the worlds largest architect.
The three designers were required to work within the existing masterplan and the investment value of the scheme. The participants were given the freedom to reorganise land use, mix, height and other development parameters provided they kept to the allocated boundaries.
SOMs entry was the unanimous choice of the competitions international jury. It was particularly praised for demonstrating exceptional sensitivity to the ecological and cultural context of Sri Lanka.
The project will give Colombo a 269ha extension on land reclaimed from the sea. It is being developed by the government of Sri Lanka and Chinese group, CHEC Port City Colombo, a subsidiary of the China Communications Construction Company (CCCC).
The ambitious scheme, part of Chinas One Belt, One Road global transport infrastructure strategy, is set for completion in 2041.
Altogether, the city will have five distinct districts: the Financial District, Central Park Living, Island Living, The Marina and the International Island.
N Rupasinghe, the secretary to the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development, commented in apress statementthat the project was intended to present a modern image of Sri Lanka. He said: Unlike anytime in the history of our country where our cities have taken centuries to grow organically, today we have a planned city which will be completed in 25 years.
Lim Kian Siew, Director of Planning and Development at CHEC Port City Colombo, added that the company would take the best ideas from all three of the submissions. He said: All the submissions contained ideas we consider worth exploring. We are open to ideas from all the entries provided they are viable and implementable.
Of course every competition needs a winner and SOM has proved to be better than the others.
SOM said its design was influenced by Sri Lankas varied landscape and complex tropical climate.
Itsaid: The squares, canal edges, gardens, a new harbour, and a new city park take cues from the local environment to create a sympathetic proposal that is rooted in the countrys unique geography and ecology.
The port city has been an object of intense political controversy both within Sri Lanka, and as an element in the growing geopolitical rivalry between India and China. See related stories below for more on this aspect of the scheme.

The third consecutive Tourism Leaders Summit and International Research Symposium will be held at the BMICH in Colomb on October 3 and 4.
Tourism Leaders Summit and International Research Symposium will be held on the theme Sustainable Tourism for Development - Way forward for Sri Lanka.
"Sustainable Tourism for Development" is the global theme envisaged by the UN-WTO for year 2017. This theme will be reviewed for a Sri Lankan perspective through deliberations on important topics for Sri Lanka Tourism.
The Tourism Leaders Summit and International Research Symposium is partnered by the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs and Sri Lanka Tourism as the strategic partner. Nearly 1500 local and foreign industry professionals are expected to take part in the main event while there will be a series of fringe events on the sidelines of this summit and symposium.

'SL positioned to attract global operations that want to tap into India'
Following is the text of the interview that President Maithripala Sirisena recently gave to the Oxford Business Group:
Q: How can Sri Lanka work more closely with the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation (SAARC) in coordinating regional security
A: SAARCs objectives should go beyond regional politics and find ways to create close links among the eight nations. Culture is a great unifier in our region. SAARC plays a pivotal role in fostering harmony and understanding among members, and building a strong base for regional understanding.
The expansion of intra-regional economic integration in South Asia is the key to stronger security in the region. However, regional economic cooperation has not seen an equitable increase.
Sri Lanka advocates increased economic cooperation based on equitable trade by complementing the strengths of each economy.
Such regional cooperation would definitely lead to stronger security coordination in the region.
I am glad to note that despite certain bilateral issues preventing cooperation among some members, there is already healthy security coordination in many areas, such as drugs and arms control.
Q: How will the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) impact Sri Lanka
A: The complementary economic developments in India and Sri Lanka will be further enhanced by the ETCA.
A significant share of Sri Lankan exports enter India through ports in southern India, and a large share of the cargo is trans-shipped to ports on the Indian subcontinent.
The ETCA will provide the opportunity to strengthen cooperation between our two countries, paving the way for an interrelated and integrated system of cooperation.
In coming to any trade agreement, we take care to ensure that both countries benefit from an agreement, by safeguarding sectors in which each country has a comparative advantage.
The government understands the dynamics and will engage all groups to ensure that the best solution is reached.
Sri Lanka will follow a very transparent process in entering a free trade agreement, which will be referred to the Parliament for approval. Ultimately, a trade agreement depends on implementation in practice.
Q: In the medium-to-long term will deeper trade and investment integration create more opportunities and interest among foreign investors
A: The Indian middle class alone is many times the size of our entire population.
Businesses in Sri Lanka cannot succeed by catering to our small domestic market, especially when we have this growing consumer market across from us.
Sri Lanka is well positioned to attract global operations that want to tap into India. We have met many investors who are waiting to see what kind of integration we have with India, so that they can come and invest here, employ people and create exports for the Indian market.
Q: What can be done to further develop the research and development segment in Sri Lanka
A: We consider the development of science and technology important in promoting economic development, though we cannot be satisfied with the achievements in these sectors so far. As I said at the Asia Cooperation Dialogue Summit in Bangkok, we are ready to take the lead as a prime mover in science, technology and innovation. We look forward to working closely with other Asian countries so that we may share knowledge and capabilities in this area. For this purpose, Sri Lanka will establish a regional centre for innovation in Colombo.
We aspire to become an innovation economy and are keen to develop a skilled human resource base. We are introducing extensive reforms in education to strengthen science, technology and innovation capacity among our youth. It is also important to keep up with the latest innovation to make sure that our exports are attractive to foreign markets.

Smokeless tobacco products banned
No person shall manufacture, import, sell or offer for sale any specified tobacco products, any smokeless tobacco product or mixture that contains tobacco, any flavoured, coloured or any electronic cigarettes that contains tobacco, National Authority of Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Chairman Dr. Palitha Abeykoon said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department in Colombo, he said products now available in the market such as Babul, Beeda, Mawa, Pampara and Gurkha are banned in the country. Importing or selling such items is a punishable offence since September 1, 2016 (last year). But still people are not aware of this, he said.
The Dean of the Dental Faculty of Peradeniya University Prof. W. M. Tillakaratne said daily, four persons die in Sri Lanka due to smokeless tobacco use and oral cancer has become the most common cancer in Sri Lankan men.
A recent NATA research revealed that sportsmen in popular Colombo schools use illegal products in order to get a `kick'.
Those illegal products such as Babul, Beeda, Mawa, Pampara and Gurkha are available in the Sri Lankan market in various names including rural women's names. They cause oral cancer. When a person gets an oral cancer, the government spends millions to save him or her and the surgeon has to perform over 20 hours of long surgery. Even after all that, some patients die. Around 1,000 oral cancer patients die annually in Sri Lanka, he said.

Sri Lanka to probe 2011 World Cup cricket defeat
Sri Lanka's sports minister gave his support Wednesday for an investigation into the country's controversial 2011 World Cup loss against India, amid fresh allegations of match fixing.
The South Asian nation lost the World Cup decider by six wickets at Wankhede stadium in Mumbai, stunning the cricket-mad island. Then Sri Lanka skipper Kumar Sangakkara resigned soon after the match.
Pressure has since been mounting for an inquiry into the shock defeat, with a former cricket captain and a previous sports minister going public with their suspicions that Sri Lanka deliberately lost the match.
"The allegations merit an investigation," Dayasiri Jayasekera told reporters in Colombo.
"As soon as I get a written complaint, I will start a probe."
Sri Lanka, batting first, scored 274-6 off 50 overs and appeared in a commanding position when Indian superstar Sachin Tendulkar was caught for 18.
India turned the game dramatically thanks partly to poor fielding and bowling by Sri Lanka.
The sports minister at the time Mahindananda Aluthgamage has raised fresh concerns, telling local media there were "several disturbing factors about that game".
Four last-minute changes were made to the Sri Lankan side without prior approval being sought from the sports minister, breaching convention.
"Then there are also questions about the behaviour of a very senior player. During the match, instructions sent to the field were ignored," Aluthgamage said, without naming the player in question.
The former minister said he launched an inquiry after the match, but the investigation was scuttled.
His concerns followed quick on the heels of comments from former Sri Lanka skipper Arjuna Ranatunga, who last Friday demanded an inquiry be held to expose the "dirt" on dodgy cricketers.
Last year, the International Cricket Council imposed a three-year ban on a top Sri Lankan official Jayananda Warnaweera for failing to cooperate with an anti-corruption investigation.
Sri Lankan players and umpires have been accused of match fixing in the past, but Warnaweera was the first high ranking official to be found guilty and penalised.
Although no big-name Sri Lankan player has ever been convicted of corruption, several former stars have made allegations of match fixing or spot-fixing -- when players deliberately bowl or field badly to give away a set number of runs. - AFP

Sri Lanka's key player Harshana Godamanna gave a superb start by beating Heve Kelley in comfortable straight sets 6/1, 6/3 in the first singles, but Sharmal Dissanayake was unable to maintain momentum and went down to Colin Sinclair 4/6, 4/6 in the other singles match.
Both Harshana and Sharmal put up a superb show in the doubles match against Brett Baudinet and Aymeric Mara 6/3, 6/1 to seal the second victory for Sri Lanka in the tournament. Earlier Sri Lanka defeated Jordan 2/1 in their opening tie.
Sri Lanka is on top of Group 'A' winning two out of two followed by Pacific Oceania with one win in two outings. The other Group 'A' countries, Jordan and Syria are yet to record a win, losing one tie each.
Meanehile Lankan lasses too performed well in the Fed Cup Asia Oceania Group II being worked off at Dushanbe Central Stadium hard courts, Tajikistan.

Bishop will call on President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe today. Karunanayake said his talks with his Australian counterpart were aimed at enhancing bilateral cooperation in areas of economic partnership, development cooperation, tourism, reconciliation, and maritime security.
He made an open invitation to Australian investors to take full advantage of Sri Lanka transforming itself into an important and viable logistical hub in the East-West maritime.
The two ministers during their talks have also paid attention to enhance cooperation in technical and vocational education and training to empower Sri Lankan youth.
It is a happy coincidence that Foreign Minister of Singapore Vivian Balakrishnan and Foreign Minister Julie Bishop are visiting Sri Lanka at the same time. We have made use of this opportunity to meet together tomorrow and discuss issues of common interest, Karunanayake said.
Bishop in her speech said statistics of a recent census revealed that 170,000 Sri Lankans have found homes in Australia as at present.
She said 30,000 Sri Lankan students have obtained Australian educational qualifications under the Colombo Plan programme, adding that this programme has been broadened to enable more student exchange programmes.

Thai King to control worlds richest royal fortune
THAILAND: Thailand's military government has given the country's new king full control over what is reputed to be the world's richest royal fortune, estimated at more than $US30 billion ($38 billion).
King Maha Vajiralongkorn now has authority to manage the Crown Property Bureau, a unique and little-known institution that controls a vast portfolio of properties and investments, as he sees fit.
Thailand's parliament, which is stacked with military appointees after a 2014 coup, last week rubber-stamped with little publicity the first amendments to the Crown Property Act in 69 years. The exact size of the fortune has not been made public in the country, where draconian lese-majeste laws shield the monarchy from scrutiny.
The bureau holds stakes in Siam Commercial Bank and Siam Cement that alone are worth more than $US9 billion.
The bureau owns at least 8400 hectares of land in Bangkok, mainly in the historic part of the city. Across the country the bureau has 40,000 rental properties, about 17,000 in Bangkok, including government offices, slum communities, shops, markets and prime sites occupied by hotels, office blocks and shopping centres. Some analysts estimate the assets could be worth as much as $US60 billion.
The assets belong to the monarchy as an institution which continues from reign to reign, but not to the king in his private capacity, and are held in trust for the nation.
King Vajiralongkorn, 64, has become increasingly assertive since ascending to the throne in December following the death in October of his father, King Bhumibol Adulyadej, a revered figure who ruled for seven decades. A royal decree in April transferred five state agencies overseeing royal affairs, including palace security, from the government's to the king's supervision.
Under the decree those working in the agencies are considered to be under the king's custody  not civil servants or state officials. Constitutional amendments early this year included a provision allowing the king to travel overseas without having to appoint a regent and ended the need for all royal decrees to be countersigned by a government official. The king has also replaced some of his father's loyalists with his own appointees.
A palace announcement stated that the bureau's properties, in addition to the king's private properties, will be managed at His Majesty's discretion.
It stated the monarch can assign to the bureau any individual or agency to manage the properties and assets.
The new laws give the king sole power to appoint a board of directors to manage crown property and appoint its chairperson, a position previously held by whoever was finance minister. - SYDNEY MORNING HERALD

Of those foreign jaunts
President Maithripala Sirisena has once again spoken of the need for a curb on overseas travel of government ministers, MPs and state officials, noting that, more often than not, these ministers and officials overstay their visits after attending some international conference or other. Implicit in the Presidents remarks, made at a meeting with ministry secretaries on Monday, is that these extended overseas stays are at the expense of the taxpayer. The President also wanted a follow up on the plethora of bi-lateral agreements signed by the government during visits of the Head of State and ministers to foreign countries. He said, during his recent visit to Bangladesh, as much as 12 such bi-lateral agreements were signed, which, according to the host countrys Prime Minister, was the highest number of agreements signed by the Bangladeshi government on a single day. He called for the appointment of an additional secretary at ministerial level to follow up on these agreements.
Also, the Presidents advise to the Secretaries that no single official should have a monopoly on foreign travel, no doubt, will be welcomed by the second tier officers who had been overlooked for such overseas travel wherein they could gain valuable exposure and insight to do with their profession. Being ignored continually could also lead to frustration and affect output of these officers.
True, overseas travel are being frequently undertaken by ministers, MPs and government functionaries, sometimes, for the flimsiest of reasons, and, often, for no reason at all, with nary a thought that the public has to foot the bill for the official stay as well as the extended stay, as pointed out by the President. Perhaps, the countrys Foreign Minister can be an exception to the rule, given the nature of his duties, but here too the tendency has been to go overboard. We say this because there was once a Foreign Minister who presented Supplementary Estimates to parliament to cover up his extravagant spending during his overseas visits, undertaken at the drop of a hat, with spouse and brood in tow. That worthy overreached himself by undertaking a visit to Iceland, a diplomatic outpost, where Sri Lanka is concerned.
It is such extravagance, no doubt, that the President had in mind when he prevailed upon government politicians and officials to minimize their foreign visits, and, what is more, to keep tabs on the agreements signed with foreign countries during such visits. Like the President noted, there had been no follow-up action on these trade and economic pacts even in the past. There has been much show, highlighting these agreements, where ministers or government representatives are shown exchanging letters denoting this or that trade pact, in the full glare of publicity, with photo opportunities with Heads of State and other dignitaries. However the public is left in the dark as to what have become of these agreements. No one is aware of what became of the agreements signed with much pomp and ceremony during the series of overseas visits by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. Similar agreements are also signed during visits to this country by foreign leaders, but what became of their fate is anyones guess.
Hence, the suggestion by the President for the appointment of a monitoring authority in this connection is most welcome. The Right to Information could now come in handy for the public to verify if these agreements were real or phony ones, signed merely for the cameras, to bolster the egos of ministers or some government panjundrum. Not just the trade agreements, the President should also insist on a report of the various study tours undertaken by ministers, MPs and even local government politicians. We say this because many a study tour had been undertaken with regard to garbage management by ministers as well as LG politicians in the past. But the country is still neck deep in garbage, so to speak. Jolly rides could not to be condoned for ministers and MPs, to add to the numerous perks and privileges they now enjoy, unless they give value for money.
A mechanism should also be put in place for the effective monitoring of the affairs of our overseas missions. This is because, as is well known, these postings have been taken for granted as all paid holidays for the kith and kin and supporters of the governments in power. The output of these appointees should be kept tabs on and those found wanting should be recalled and placed in other unimportant assignments, if rewarding past favours is what the authorities have in mind. The taxpayer should not be called upon to pick the tab on behalf of the deadwood in overseas postings. The country is now being made aware of the consequences of the diplomatic postings freely doled out to the kith and kin of the Rajapaksas, particularly, the heavy price the public has had to pay for their upkeep and extravagant lifestyles, for practically no returns to the country, not to mention the other scandals such as involvement in arms deals.

Our tea brand is Beta Tea and our firm, Beta Food Industry and Trade Inc., is one of the largest firms, said Chairman of Tea Food Industry and Trade Besir Ugur, who is also Chairman of Turkeys Foreign Economic Relations Boards (DEIK) Sri Lanka Business Council.
Beta Tea Chairman Ugur was meeting Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen at the Ministry offices yesterday. Joining the discussion was Turkish Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Tunca Zuhadar.
I was greatly inspired by the Global Ceylon Tea Party event held in Ankara. We are a major importer of Ceylon tea and we use it heavily in our blends in Turkey said Ugur. Our tea brand in Beta Tea and our firm, Beta Food Industry and Trade Inc is one of the largest firms in Turkey with branches in 16 countries. In fact, my Beta Food Industry and Trade Inc is the 12th largest tea firm in the world.
The Ceylon Tea we buy is sold in Turkey and Central Asia. We like to expand our tea cooperation with Sri Lanka and during my visit here, I intend to study more.
Even though China is worlds largest tea market, Turkey is the biggest per person tea consumer in the world (at 6.87 kg per capita).
Minister Bathiudeen welcomed Chairman Ugurs interest to partner with Ceylon Tea and said: According to the Department of Commerce of Sri Lanka under me, two thirds of our annual exports to Turkey is Ceylon Tea. In fact, Turkey was the fourth largest buyer of Ceylon Tea after Iran, Russia and Iraq, last year. Also we exported $1.2 billion of tea to the world last year and 8% of it was taken by Turkey.

Emmerson visited the country from July 10 to 14 and found fault with the government for being too slow with the reforms process.
Excerpts of the Cabinet media briefing on the topic are as follows:
Journalist: There were reports that the Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapaksa had an argument with the Special Rapporteur, Ben Emmerson. He then delivered a very negative report, what is the response of the government
Minister Rajitha Senaratne: We saw the consequences the former regime reaped when they had conflicts with the international community. We must understand who we are and have a realistic estimate of our power.We are a small island nation.So we are going to fight with the UN, who is the UN It is us. There are people here who launch fasts against the UN, which means they are fasting against Sri Lanka. The UN is not a country, it is an organization we are a member of. We pay a fee for it, we get certain facilities through it and are allowed to address the international community through it. And we get to attend its various committees.
So when their representatives come here, we must explain things to them carefully. They come with various reports which at times are negative towards us. They are complaints and thats what they bring and we are bound to answer them. It is not only us but every country is bound thus. We are party to all their treaties and have to submit to their inspections, similar to all countries. The only treaty we havent signed is the Statute of Rome, thanks the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, because he did not sign it in 2002. Which means that they cannot arrest any of us for war crimes.
So when they come to question us, all those questions are not going to be in our favour. And when these people come we must deal with it diplomatically. Though we might be angry with their reports, because they tend to be biased as they come with reports from extremists there. But we saw what happened when the previous regime chose a more adversarial approach. If we had not been elected into government in 2015, it would not have been possible to stop the international community from imposing sanctions on us in March of that year. If that happened, millions would be on the streets without jobs, our reserves would have dropped, and the country would be in an abyss.
So we saved the country with diplomacy not by fighting.We accept that as a country we still have to provide solutions for many issues. We still have no solution for political prisoners, we still havent resolved the land issues of the Tamil people, the missing still have not been found, so when we have all these issues, we cannot say that as a government we have been successful.
You also realize that whatever the government does, there are extremist forces on the other side trying to disrupt everything. So we need to resolve this issue within the country first and the international community too is aware of this.
The Emmerson report also notes that we have also taken some progressive steps. They also understand the problems we have.
Journalist: The report also shows that extreme torture methods are still practiced by the police. Why cant the government tackle this
Minister Senaratne: No we cannot accept all that because we dont what the basis of their data is.
Journalist: They say that over 70 people have been detained for over five years without trial
Minister Senaratne: Those are Tamil political prisoners. I have told Cabinet to resolve this issue and either lodge a case against them or release them. Similar to what they did with the JVP activists in the 70s and 80s. Because not all these people become terrorists the second time around. The JVP activists who were released in the 70s, later greatly opposed the JVP. But there is a delay in the Attorney Generals Department and we have asked them to speed things up.
Journalist: Did the President in Cabinet ask who gave permission for Emmerson to visit the prisons
Minister Senaratne: No he did not question that.He said that they had not taken permission from the Ministry of Defence before they visited the prisons. He questioned because the armed forces had complained about it to him as the Minister of Defence. When the Commissioner General of Prisons was asked about it, he said that it was done through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and that has been the procedure for some time now. Even during Mahinda Rajapaksas time, Rapporteurs had visited prisons and they had gone through the Ministry of Foreign Affairs.
Journalist: Did the President express displeasure over the meetings or did he just question the process that was followed
Minister Senaratne: It was the process that was questioned.
Journalist: Why is it necessary to take permission from the Ministry of Defence to visit prisoners as they do not come under their purview
Rajitha: It is customary to get permission from the Defence Ministry but we dont have such a system in place.
Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara: The President asked that new guidelines be put in place and followed when foreign Rapporteurs visit so that there is no misinformation. He also asked that the Ministry of Defence be kept in the loop because rumours spread that they went with various people.

Use of drones for filming to be regulated
The Civil Aviation Authority will take steps to regulate and standardize the use of drones for video filming, said Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva.
He was addressing a workshop organized by the Civil Aviation Authority at its auditorium in Hunupitiya, Colombo recently.
"Today drone cameras are being used in an irregular manner," the Minister said and added that once regulations were introduced, registration with the Civil Aviation Authority would be mandatory for such activities in addition to the approval of the Defence Ministry and Cultural Archeological, Irrigation and Power and Energy Authorities as well as the Police station of the respective region or area.
The Civil Aviation Authority had emphasized that registration or approval was unnecessary to operate a drone below 200 grams weight without a camera or filming equipment in a persons home garden within an airspace below 150 feet heigh for leisure or education purposes.
But once regulations were introduced, all drones above that weight fixed with filming equipment as well as its operators should be registered with the Civil Aviation Authority.
Regulations in this regard would be introduced in Parliament for approval after which the Civil Aviation Authority would be empowered to implement them.
