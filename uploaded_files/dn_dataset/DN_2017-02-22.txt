SL soon a child labour free country
Sri Lanka is heading towards a child labour free country, Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) Director General Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe said.
He was addressing the launch of DCSs Child Activity Survey 2016, yesterday at the Waters Edge.
The survey was conducted at the request of the Labour and Trade Union Relations Ministry.
The International Labour Organization (ILO) provided assistance to conduct this countrywide household survey in 2016, he said. He added that this is the third in the series of Child Activity Surveys (CAS) conducted by the DCS. The previous rounds were conducted in 1999 and 2008/2009 with the assistance of the ILO.
The total number of children in the age group of 5-17 years in Sri Lanka in 2016 is estimated at 4.6 million.
The survey estimates that 90.1 percent of the children were attending school during the survey period. Among the children not attending school, a majority (84.2 percent) are in the 15-17 year age group and about half of them are awaiting G.C.E (O/L) results.
A small 6.8 percent have not yet enrolled due to being below the age of 5 by January. The survey revealed that only about 2.3 percent of children aged 5-17 years are engaged in some kind of economic activity.
This is a decline by 10.6 percentage points from the 12.9 percent reported in 2008/2009.
The total child labour is only 1 percent of the total child population and hazardous form of child labour is as low as 0.9 percent.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Ministry Secretary M.I.M Rafeek said accurate and timely data plays a major role in formulating policies in order to make need-based demand driven interventions to bring about rapid developments in the country. At a time where much emphasis is laid on good governance, transparency and accountability, policymakers should have access to reliable data in order to justify the reasons behind the policies formulated by them, he said.
He said the statistics pave way for a scientific approach to investigate all available evidence in formulating policies which will result in achieving the desired outcome.
Labor and Trade Union Relations Ministry Secretary Gotabaya Jayaratne, Research and Evaluation ILO Geneva Head Azfer Khan also attended the ceremony.

Solutions sought for land issues in Ayagama
Short and long term solutions should be found to the problems encountered by the people in Ayagama and surrounding areas reeling under the influence of a long spell of drought, said G.M. Jayasundara.
He was representing Parliamentarian Vasudeva Nanayakkara at a meeting of the Ayagama Regional Co-ordinating Committee held at the Ayagama Divisional Secretariat on February 20. Kalawana UNP Chief Organiser Sarathchandra Ramanayake presided.
UNP Parliamentarian A.A. Wijetunge said limitations could be imposed on a land which is a private property under a court ruling. MOH Dr. Namal Kasthuriarachchi pointed out that the river water had been polluted because shop keepers had diverted their waste into the river. Jayasundara said a worse problem may occur in future unless steps were taken to preserve catchment areas of rivers and streams. Assistant Director (Planning) M.L.S. Medawala said a majority of proposals for development of rural infrastructure had been submitted in relation to schools and temples. Such proposals may have to be dropped because funding was not provided for such development from ministries. MOH Kasthuriarachchi said the biggest problem in Ayagama was the lack of a proper waste management system. Since the Pradeshiya Sabha could not handle it single handed a proper plan should be discussed in collaboration with Estate managements and other institutions. He said it would be most advisable to invite representatives of the management of estates to attend the coordinating meeting in future. He also said complaints were being received daily about man made fires in forest land in the area.
Kalawana Forest Range Officer R.M.L. Ratnaweera said a large number of wetlands in the area were being brought under tea cultivation. Wetlands should be kept untouched without bringing them under any cultivation. He said land problems could be avoided if the LRC surveyed the land prior to land alienation. He said boundaries of forest land should be properly marked to overcome unnecessary land problems.

Up to speed
The Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China, Ministry of Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs, and the China Cultural Center of Sri Lanka organized a Chinese cultural fair, entitled Happy Chinese New Year-Wonderful Jiangsu, to celebrate Chinese New Year and honor 60 years of bilateral relations between the two countries. The event took place on Thursday, February 16th.
A group of performers from Jiangsu province graced the occasion, and they put on over ten different acts, ranging from juggling and magic to displays of swordsmanship and traditional dance.
The visitors from Jiangsu took the stage after a medley of Sri Lankan dance that was put on by the State Dance Ensemble.
Act of celebration
The first act was, as the announcer called it, an act of celebration, where six male performers dressed in shiny, flowing red pants and yellow vests performed acrobatic dances while each holding their own red and yellow lion puppet. They performed synchronized twists and twirls all the while making their lion puppets dance. In the midst of their routine, eight women came on stage wearing blue and pink and carrying a green handkerchief in one hand and a small flower drum in the other. They performed a more relaxed dance, cerebrally swaying to the traditional Chinese music and waving their handkerchiefs in the air.
Diabolo performance
Up next was a Diabolo performance. This art consists of spinning an hourglass-shaped implement on a string attached to two sticks. It is akin to juggling, and the two women who performed were simply incredible.
They gracefully moved about the stage, all the while tossing the the hourglass object in the air before catching it in all manner of positions.
They even played catch, throwing the
object back and forth and cathing it on their strings.
Traditional Chinese boxing
Wearing bright yellow costumes, six young men bounded across the stage, punching and kicking the air before landing prone on the ground. Each took his turn individually, jumping in the air before coming back to earth and slapping the ground. One went so far as to land in a split after sparring with his invisible partner.
Music of rain
After the boxing a troupe of women dressed in flowing green and pink performed a dance to the music of rain. A relaxed, calming affair, the dancers lithely moved about the stage, their movements evoking the relaxing effect of falling rain.
Hula hooper
After the mysterious conjuror left the stage, a peppy hula hooper bounded on in a
bright red bodysuit and started hula hooping I tup. At one point, she had four different rings going, two around her one arm, one around her torso, and the last around her legs. It was a feat of serious coordination!
Magic performance
A magician then took the stage, and began his set by conjuring white roses out of thin air. With music blaring, he proceeded to levitate a small table, going so far as to lift the tables cover to show that to is no strings were attached. His effortless performance awed the crowd, which fell silent before applauding rapturously. The magicians next feat was an act of incredible hand-eye coordination, wherein he rotated two figure eights in tandem, making them mimic each other. He then upped the ante, using four figure eights to create all manner of shapes. The magician was certainly one of the evenings more popular performers.
Another folk dance followed, this one centering on lotus roots. A woman in red took the stage accompanied by two small green objects that followed her around. As she danced, she appeared to care for these green items, watering them and urging them to grow, and they soon sprouted into lotus flowers as the women went from their bent-over position to a standing one. They then continued the dance to lighthearted music before smilingly exiting the stage.
8. The next performance was by a pop singer who sang a Chinese tune before switching over to some Frank Sinatra. He spoke in Chinese and didnt quite connect with the crowd, but his style was impeccable and he did have a good voice.
9. One of the crowds favorite performances was next, where two women lay on their backs while manipulating ceramic vases with their feet high above them. They rotated the jugs and tossed them back and forth without making a single mistake. They then started twirling mats on their hands and feet, a truly exceptional feat of coordination.
10. Much to the childrens amusement, the jugglers then took the stage. First up was a man who juggled badminton racquets. He started with three and then went all the way to five. It was quite a display. His partner then came on while juggling bowling pins. They then did a routine where they tossed bowling pins back and forth.
11. Then there was a display of acrobatic swordsmanship. The swordsmen flew around the stage slashing the air with their blades.
12. The following display was one of puppetry, as a woman came on with a large witch-like figure. The puppeteer deftly changed the colour of the puppets face while rocking back and forth to music.
13. The final act was a dance of the jasmine flowers, where about ten women danced to classic Chinese music before producing mock jasmine flowers. It was a calm, beautiful way to end the evening.

Stolen youth
A young girl smiles in the mirror. She can see her glowing fresh skin, neat lips and youthful eyes. Thick black hair falling up to her shoulders. The very feature that she adored, the treasure which she guarded amidst cruel resistance. She struggled to protect it from the ones who wanted it to be cut; the ones who believed that the womanly beauty she was innocently proud of should be crushed to pieces, revealing the creature that they wanted to exhibit in their world.
A gloomy day dawned. The sky was heavy with pregnant clouds, about to deliver the drops of rain. They took the scissors. The creaking of the scissor blades was deafening, not just her ears, but her very soul. They cut it. They cut it short as they wished. She cried. She wept. She griped. But the cutting didnt stop. She could see the black flocks of hair falling at her feet.
She stopped weeping. The tears dried. But the heart became heavy, very heavy. A burden that she would carry ever.
She saw herself in the mirror. Tears streamed in and started to crawl down her cheeks.

When the owner was digging the ground for construction purposes, he had noticed the suspicious bones and notified the Eravur Police. The police had obtained a court order for the excavation. Police protection has also been deployed at the site which has been excavated to retrieve the buried suspected human remains.

Tea prices likely to rally on shortfall in production

Tea prices are seen firm and likely to rally due to the shortfall in production.
Production of tea is estimated to be on the shorter side for the first half of the year due to the drought-like conditions in major black tea producing countries like India, Kenya and Sri Lanka.
India is the leading producer of black tea in the world with 25% share of the total production. Interestingly, India consumes 75-80 % of its own production.
R Sanjith, head (Commodities) of United Planters Association of Southern India (UPASI), told FE that the production scenario looks bleak with major countries reporting lower production from November.
The crop scenario for the next six months looks bleak due to drought-like conditions in most of the tea producing region. Kenya did well last year but from November the crop is seen lower and prices have gone up, he added.
He estimates the market to remain firm on the lower production.
Sri Lankas tea output fell 15.3 % in January due to adverse weather and poor application of fertilizers, says a Sri Lankan government report, adding that the island nations tea output hit a seven-year low in 2016,falling 11% in its third straight year of declining production.
Tea prices have gone up in Kenya and Sri Lanka and this will help us export more. Even the lowest grade Kenyan tea was selling above $2.50 per kg, while Sri Lankan tea has gone up to $2.60-2.80 per kg.
This should be good news for South India tea and we may gain more export orders, Sriram Narayanaswamy, president of Global Tea Brokers said.
He added that the Kenyan scenario turned bad after the first half of January and many factories are reported to be closed on lower availability of tea.

Transcend  provides  groundbreaking  transport services
Since 2009, Sri Lanka has seen strong year-on-year, double digit-growth in tourist arrivals. Overall infrastructure development has significantly boosted the growth and modernization of tourism, and in particular the level of offerings at hotels.

However, unlike most tourist transport service providers who are waiting for government assistance and relief, the evolution of the transport sector is currently being led by a company that is geared to revolutionize travel in Sri Lanka.
Established in the late 1990s, Transcend Drive, operating under the name Drumkin Transporters has been providing ground-breaking travel solutions, thus far.

Responsible in recent times for the brand-new fleet of Audis currently being used by Cinnamon Grand and Cinnamon Lakeside, it has emerged as a reputable provider of first class ground transport services within the tourism industry. Offering solutions to business and leisure travellers, the companys ultimate aim is high quality transport for everyone. Transcend Drive monitors all daily fleet movements via two way and GPS tracking which is fitted to all the vehicles in the fleet. At Transcend, safety is a high priority.

Treasury bonds issued in ad hoc manner in the past
Central Bank Governor Indrajit Coomaraswamy said yesterday that he was surprised by the ad hoc manner in which the Central Bank Treasury Bonds have been issued in the past.
The CBSL Governor was testifying before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds.
The Presidential Commission comprised of Supreme Court judges Justice K.T. Chitrasri , Justice Prasanna Jayawardena and Retired Deputy Auditor General Kandasamy Veluppillai. Asked on how frequently treasury bonds are issued, CBSL Governor said that there is no certain pattern or time frame to issue a treasury bond.
They are issued as required, he said.Now we are trying to move into a planned out structure for the issuance of treasury bonds. We are also trying to move into an annual auction calendar as well. he also said.
CBSL Governor Coomarasamy was yesterday summoned by the Presidential Commission of inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds as the first evidence to the controversial CB Treasury bond issue.
Presidents Counsel Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Senior State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie lead the evidence.
CBSL Governor Coomaraswamy also said, had he been in office when the controversial CB bond issue took place, he would have recommended using auction method rather than direct placement method when issuance of bonds.
CBSL Governor Coomaraswamy made the observation when he was cross-examined by the Senior State Counsel Shaheeda Barrie as to who is responsible to decide on a method, direct placement method or otherwise, to issue a treasury bond.
Coomaraswamy said that he is unaware as to who decided on the method of issuing the bonds with regards to the issue at hand.
The decision may have come from the Domestic Debt Management Committee (DDMC) or the Monetary Board, CBSL Governor said.
He also pointed out, usually, a CBSL Governor only sees into the outlining of the information regarding an issuance of bonds but does not usually get involved in the process. At present, the Governor of Central Bank is not involved in the issuance of treasury bonds at all, Coomaraswamy also pointed out.
When asked on a historical basis, who usually would have taken the decisions on issuance of bond within 2015-2016, Coomaraswamy said the DDMC may have taken the initial decision to issue the treasury bonds.
Asked could the Monetary Board have taken the decision within the same period, the Governor observed that in 2008 there was an occasion recorded where the Monetary Board has taken the decision of issuing treasury bonds.A question was posed by a member of the Presidential Commission, Judge of the Supreme Court Prasanna Jayawardena, on a meeting held on February 27, 2015. He questioned as to how it seems that bonds worth one billion rupees were issued at an auction on the same day the aforesaid meeting that technically should be preceding a treasury bond issuance.
CBSL Governor Coomaraswamy replying to the question said he is unable to give an answer since there is need for some clarification on the said event.
He also suggested the meeting held on the February 27,2015 may have been on bond issuance for the month of March 2015.
However, he said he is unable to answer since he needs more clarifications on the matter. The Counsel assisting the Commission of Inquiry proposed the Presidential Commission to summon the officials who held office in the time period referred to before the Commission. Asked if the Central Bank monitor the bond trading secondary market CBSL Governor said from September 2016 the CBSL is monitoring the secondary market. Before September 2016, there was no way for the CBSL to receive real-time information on the secondary market, Coomaraswamy explained.
CBSL Governor Coomaraswamy also said the main objective in the issuance of treasury bonds is to acquire loans for the government with a minimum cost to the government. CBSL Governor said the primary auction transactions were settled by script until 2004, which was then done by an electronic system.
The Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into the Issuance of Treasury Bonds will meet today at 10 am.

## Title: Tripartite agreement with India, Japan mooted

Tripartite agreement with India, Japan mooted
Satoru Nagao, a Research Fellow at the Tokyo Foundation and Lecturer of Security Studies at the Law Faculty of Japans Gakushuin University, urged Sri Lanka to forge stronger ties with India and regional powers like Japan to balance its relationship with the increasingly aggressive China.
Nagao spoke last Wednesday at the Institute of National Security Studies, and warned that increased cooperation between India, Sri Lanka, and Japan will be key to limiting Chinas influence in the Indian Ocean.
A new system has gradually emerged where several multinational security cooperation arrangements have recently been formed. Under this new system, Japan-Sri Lanka-India co-operation has an important role, he said.
Much of Nagaos lecture focused on Chinas increasing threat to East and Southeast Asia, as evidenced by its increased aggressiveness regarding the development of several islands in the South China Sea. Waning American influence in the eastern Pacific Ocean has emboldened China, which has historically exploited gaps in alliances and power vacuums to expand its influence.
Dr. Satoru Nagao
When France withdrew from Vietnam in the 1950s, China occupied half of the Paracel Islands. and the other half in 1974 immediately after the Vietnam War and the US withdrew from the region. After the Soviet Union withdrew from Vietnam, China attacked the Spratly Islands controlled by Vietnam in 1988.
Nagao emphasised that the bilateral alliances between the United States and individual Pacific countries, such as U.S.-Japan, U.S.-Phillippines, and U.S.-Australia ties, would have to give way to multilateral ties wherein the Pacific countries work to cooperate together without depending on the United States.
He warned that East Asian countries are feeling increasingly threatened by Chinas brazenness and its apparent disregard for international law, as evidenced by its ignoring a 2016 decision by the Permanent Court of Arbitration that rejected its territorial claims in the South China Sea.
These concerns have heightened due to Chinas acquisition of at least 42 submarines between 2000 and 2015.
Japan and countries around the South China Sea are likely to suffer from Chinas assertiveness in the near future. Therefore, a need exists for us to maintain a military balance with China despite their large military budget, he said.
Nagao further emphasised that China has increasingly set its sights on becoming a major player in the Indian Ocean, as it has undertaken large-scale port development projects in Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar, and Sri Lanka as part of its String of Pearls strategy.
Despite that these projects appear to be economic development initiatives, Nagao argued that they are in fact barely concealed tactics to increase its military abilities in the Indian Ocean, as the new ports could be used as naval supply bases.
Furthermore, China is selling weapons to countries that surround India, further shifting the balance of power in the region. Pakistan has recently purchased eight Chinese-made submarines, while Bangladesh bought two.
These submarines will, to a great degree, regulate Indias naval activities because the Indian Navy must have sufficient ships to maintain regular oversight over the locations and purposes of other countries submarines, Nagao said.
Chinas increasing military might, shrewd tactics, and aggression threaten to change the balance of power in the Indian Ocean in Chinas favour. If the String of Pearls does in fact come to fruition, India will find itself encircled.
Therefore, in order to fend off the Chinese in the Indian Ocean, a desire both Japan and India share, increased trilateral cooperation will be key.
It will be useful if such dialogue (between Japan and Sri Lanka) will promote a more practical Japan-Sri Lanka-India strategic trilateral dialogue. Through such dialogue, both Japan and India can share info, better identify Sri Lankan needs, and choose courses of cooperation or support, he said.
Furthermore, the possibility exists that the network of these trilateral security initiatives would culminate and contribute to India initiatives including the Indian Ocean Rim Association and Indian Ocean Naval Symposium as a collective security system in the near future,he said.
Along with trilateral dialogues, it will be important to augment communications between Sri Lanka, Japan, and India to counter the Chinese threat. Due to Sri Lankas wariness of India, Nagao noted that Japan can act as the perfect mediator between the two countries.
If Japan and India mutually collaborate, then the two countries can support Sri Lanka more effectively. For example, if Japan and India collaborate to establish a maritime communications network system in Sri Lanka that would serve the entire Indian Ocean, it would be easy for the three countries to be aware of what occurs in the Indian Ocean.
A high probability exists that India will be the most influential sea power to fill the power vacuum in the Indian Ocean region in the near future, and the strategic location of Sri Lanka has affected the security of the entire Indo-pacific, he said.
Indias Role
While Chinas influence rises and that of the United States falls in the Indian Ocean, Japan and India will have to bear more responsibility to secure the region and deter China from violating international maritime and territorial laws.
Part of this claim lies in the fact that India boasts a massive coastline and has set a goal of augmenting its naval fleet to include 200 ships within the next decade. On top of this, the Indian Navy accounts for 15.8 percent of the Indian Defense budget, which is up from 12.7 percent in 1990.
A high probability exists that India will be the most influential sea power to fill the power vacuum in the Indian ocean region in the near future, Nagao said.
Moreover, there is evidence that India will be a cooperative maritime actor, as it accepted a 2014 UN decision on a disagreement between India and Bangladesh regarding the two countries coastal boundaries.
Nagao contended that the United States and Japan would welcome Indias taking the responsibility of protecting the Indian Ocean waters from further Chinese incursion.
It seems that Japan and the US would wish India to exhibit a more positive role in the Indian Ocean. Indias rise helps lower the heavy burdens of Japan and the US in the Indian Ocean and helps them to concentrate naval and air military resources toward areas around Japan and the South China Sea, Nagao said.
Chinese-Sri Lankan relations:Economic aspects
A Chinese submarine
Nagaos talk focused on concerns related to Sri Lanka and Indias role in preserving Japans national security, so it would follow that he slightly downplayed the significance of Chinas economic assistance to the island.
To support its own development, Sri Lanka wants to accept Chinas economic support. However, when China is building a port in Sri Lanka and their submarines visit Sri Lanka, these moves create new difficulties with India.
Though Sri Lanka has little incentive to give up Chinas backing, Nagao claimed that closer ties to Japan and India would more than make up for any economic troubles caused by shunning the Chinese.
If China supports the development of Sri Lanka, then there is little motivation for Sri Lanka to refuse economic support from China. However, from indias perspective, Chinese activities in Sri Lanka represent an encirclement strategy limiting Indias influence in the Indian Ocean.
These collaborative projects are preferable to accepting Chinas support, which would create strategic difficulties. Therefore, under Japan-Sri Lanka-India cooperation, a win-win situation can be created, he said.
This might be a winning situation for Japan, but it is unclear where Sri Lanka would turn for a similar level of economic support.
The Japanese scholar did say, however, that Japan could help fill the gap left by the Chinese. He also mentioned that the projects will be better executed and of a higher quality. Asked if Japan would, like the Chinese, sell military equipment, he said that Japan would not supply any country with sub-standard military products and claimed that the submarines sold to Pakistan and Bangladesh were in bad condition.
Nagaos talk was a well-meaning wake up call for Sri Lanka, as the country might think that there are few geo-political and security downsides to accepting Chinese economic assistance. But Nagao noted that, throughout its recent history, China has leveraged its economic aid to coerce smaller, poorer countries into following its strategic vision, thereby increasing its imprint on the world stage.

These threats and harassment can take many different forms: ragging, sexual harassment, bullying, sexual or gender based violence, threats and intimidation. These incidents have often turned what should be a fulfilling, fun and memorable university career into something frightening and distressing.
Since many of us (students, academics, non-academic staff and administrative staff) spend a lot of our time on campus, we all have a responsibility to ensure that it is safe and secure for all of us. At the same time, it is important to have in place various initiatives to help us feel safe and secure.
The Online Complaints Mechanism, is anew initiative of the University Grants Commission that has been set up as a means for any members of the university community to lodge a complaint regarding incidents of ragging, harassment, intimidation and bullying. All complaints that are lodged will be investigated and victims of such incidents will be offered support and redress.
How does the Online Complaints Mechanism work

Is This the Underground Everest
Dont worry, you cant get lost down here. Larisa Pozdnyakovas words, in her thick Russian accent, float to me from within the caves seemingly endless black void. Apparently, she can read my mind: All I can think about is not getting lost a mile inside the Earth. For the past several hours Ive struggled to keep up as she leads me deeper into a frozen underworld known as Dark Star.
Larisa, a 30-something veteran caver from the Ural Mountains, moves with fluid, snakelike ease along our twisting route, while I grunt and heave my way after her like the clumsy rookie that I am. The cold blackness swallows the light of our headlamps just a few feet from our heads, forcing us to move like moles, scuttling, slithering, feeling our way along hundreds of feet of stiff, mud-caked ropes that help guide us through myriad passages known in caving argot as squeezes, meanders, and shafts.
These passages have already been mapped, but as we crawl up and down, side to side, I feel disoriented by the nightmarish spiral of icy mud and wet gravel. For a climber and mountaineer like me, this is an altogether different kind of navigation. Im accustomed to moving across dangerous terrain, but down here printed maps are often useless, GPS doesnt work, and there are no celestial guides to offer reassurance. And despite what Larisa tells me, I know I could never find my way out of this soul-sucking labyrinth on my own.
When I finally catch up, she has stopped at a ledge overlooking what our headlamps reveal to be a body of waterone of Dark Stars many subterranean lakes. She grabs a lanyard attached to her harness and clips it on a gritty rope attached to a bolt hammered into the rock above us.
The rope leads out over the lake and disappears into the black. The setup acts as a sort of zip line to ferry cavers across the frigid lake, too cold to swim in without a wet suit. She gives me a perky smile and steps off the ledge. Her blond ponytail whips wildly in the beam of my headlamp before she vanishes into the darkness, leaving me alone with my fears.
Im in this predicament because I signed on with a 31-member expeditioncomposed mostly of non-English-speaking Russiansto explore this monstrous limestone cave system inside a mountain in a remote corner of Uzbekistan. The Russians spotted an entrance to the cave in 1984, but British cavers were the first to reach it and began exploring the system in 1990; they named it after a satirical American sci-fi movie from the 1970s. In the decades since, Dark Star, along with neighboring Festivalnaya (the two systems may someday be found to be connected), has drawn hard-core cavers from around the world.
The allure of this huge system is similar to that which big mountains hold for climberswith one difference: We know that Mount Everest is Earths highest peak, but the potential for conquering new and enormous subterranean voids is almost limitless. More is known about the terrain of Mars than about what lies hidden beneath the Earths surface. Krubera Cave in the republic of Georgia is currently the deepest known cave, at 7,208 feet. But Dark Star, with so many areas still to survey, is a prime candidate to take over the title.
To date, eight expeditions have identified nearly 11 miles of Dark Stars passageways, the deepest lying about 3,000 feet below the surface. But the system hasnt been fully mapped, partly because of its remote location in a politically unstable region and partly because its vastness requires advanced technical abilities and a lot of equipment. Many expeditions have simply run out of rope. I can immediately see why. Just a thousand feet from our entry point, Larisa and I had already negotiated nearly a dozen roped sections.
She and I had been paired at base camp: her assignment, to guide the Amerikanski (Im sure I heard them calling me that) to Gothic camp, more than a mile inside the mountain. I would spend two nights recording the teams progress in mapping new parts of the cave and collecting scientific data.
Ice crystals populate Full Moon Hall. The chamber, 820 feet long, is the largest yet discovered in Dark Star. The entire cave system is a geological time capsule: Mineral deposits reveal millennia of climate history.
Never mind the perilous trip following Larisa to Gothic campthe aboveground journey to our base camp at the foot of the mountain was no walk in the park either. To meet up with the expedition teaman ensemble of world-class cavers and scientists ages 22 to 54 that, in addition to the Russians, included Italians, Israelis, and one GermanI traveled to Tashkent, the capital of Uzbekistan.
From there we traveled together a little over a hundred miles by bus, with hundreds of pounds of food and gear for three weeks in the field, across the arid plains. We took a popular tourist route that follows the ancient Silk Road to Samarqand. Then we turned off the beaten path, heading south toward the Afghan border to Boysun, where we loaded everything into a six-wheeled Soviet-era troop transport.
As we lumbered into the Boysuntov (also known as Baysun-Tau) Range, the mountains gradually rose to 12,000 feet and then dropped off in a jagged line of spectacular cliffs. In the deep valleys between we could see a hodgepodge of small villages where Tajiks and Uzbeks have lived for centuries, herding goats and harvesting watermelons, plums, apples, and walnuts and fetching water from springs fed by the underground rivers that perforate these mountains.

What if the world wasnt as it is
Scientists and philosophers, also our ancient witch doctors, together with soothsayers have told the world so much about our planet and her celestial neighbours and about their inhabitants. But they have not told us how and why.
But there is someone who can answer all questions. How is it and why The answer is simple. Why do mortals in times of great anxiety and remorse at moments of great joy and stupendous victories raise their eyes and look up towards Heaven. With tears in their eyes and say Aney Deviyane, Kadawule or Oh God. The same words are said in the tongues spoken in countries around the world. We saw a few most poignant and graphic examples of this at the Rio 2016 Olympics.
Evolution of men ends with the Neanderthal Men. Development of man stops. Then, suddenly the modern, intelligent, handsome modern man. Civilizations began. How Why
Man has studied the universe. About the twinkling stars in the universe and the planets that orbit round the sun, while rotating on its own axis How Why Our earth takes twenty four hours for the latter and three hundred and sixty five days round the sun giving us night and day. Also an year respectively. Fascinating! Noble Newton showed us why objects fall on to Mother Earth. But why does everything that goes up come down A world without gravity. Planets, satellites, meteors, jumbo jets, jumbu fruits flying all over. The sky will be dark with swirling objects. Why gravity Why an Ozone layer to save living beings from dehydration Why should there be the space between the earth and the sun comprising of different layers as discovered by man
Thunder and lightning occur at the same time. The speed of light and the speed of sound travel at different speeds. Why We see lightning, then can thunder be far behind. Why Still its fantastic. How is there a 4C layer of water below the mighty masses of snow Fish and other aquatic life live in it, why The seasons in temperate regions. Autumn leaves turn colour, begins to tall. Trees go to sleep. Animals go to sleep. Some begin to stock their abodes with food. Winter. Hibernation till spring. Why How
What if the rhinoceros, hippopotamus, elephant and the whale were flesh eating Where would we humans and denizens of the sea and land be Just think. Whales, shark, sea serpents, jelly fish swimming up stream to keep company with the Geta Kimbula.
Alright man! Have you seen the Hik meeya (white mouse) being pursued by cats. No. The former is slow. Has a bad taste. Always on the ground. It does not become the prey of cats. But not so the roof climbing, swift rattus rattus. A cats delight. Why, had the land lubber being spared How The centipede is swift. Could creep into any crevice in a second. Succulent meal for the birds. The millipede  'hakaralla' is very slow. Curls up when disturbed. Birds and terrestrial cock birds give it a wide birth. It happily roams about. Only humans harm them. Tell me why
Please tell me as to what the world would be, had the mighty Anaconda and the phython had poison glands in keeping with their size Or the common garandiya or rat-snake had poison glands Catastrophic.
Human beings, from may be their infant stage to dotage have an affinity to sweet food. Unless of course, the pancreas goes on the war path.
No one likes bitter food. Same with animals and birds. They cannot be even conditioned to lap up bitter food. Why How
The hatched fingerlings of the salmon swim down fresh water streams to the sea. They traverse the chilly seas of the North. After around four years, the gravid female returns to the same river or stream that brought them to the ocean as fingerlings. Swim upstream without food. Lay eggs. Return exhausted and undernourished. Never to return to the sea. They become prey to other predators and human salmon hunters. Now, why the same source of fresh water.
Scientists have tagged them. But they have never been able to tell the world why
Massive earth tremors that brought desolation to millions. The tremors took place in the ocean bed. What if they had taken place on land. Mount Everest, Antarctica, Arizona, Florida. The Siberian wastes or in the inland seas like the Dead sea, Caspian sea, Black sea or in the Sahara. Unthinkable. Our lovely scientists can tell us why. But how and when That is the question. Yes! We learnt about all this from cradle to grave. Beautiful. With all, these unanswered questions.
I still believe that we, as humans, and all other living creatures and nature can live in harmony and peace on our lovely planet while embracing the words of our celestial teachers in whom we are free to believe in.

Is your food really organic
Tired of eating stuff laden with chemicals but don't know how to go about choosing right Jayashree Joshi Eashwar, co-founder, Dubdengreen, and Mridu Mahajan Pogula, co-founder, Nirvaaha Delhi, put together a 10-point primer to help you gauge whether the food you are picking up is organic. Kavita Devgan reports
Appearance
If it is naturally and organically grown, no two items will look identical... ever! It's just not possible to find two things that look absolutely alike in nature. No two leaves of the same mango tree will ever look 100% alike.
Similarly, each apple, mango or even grain will always look different from another. Their colour, shape, structure will never be uniform. There will, for instance, be different shades of yellow in your moong dal instead of the uniformly bleached yellow of the regular packaged dal.
Size Up
Fruits, vegetables and grains won't be huge in size. So while it is okay to go "ooh aah!" over huge potatoes, tomatoes, cabbages, eggplants, cauliflower, capsicum and the humble lauki, or bottle gourd, it is better not to transfer them to your plate. There are, of course, special cases in which people do grow large-sized fruits and vegetables organically as well, but they are not the norm and are difficult to find.
Your Insect Friends
Keedas (worms) in your grains are actually good news. Naturally grown sabut daals (like moong sabut, or urad sabut), atta, maida, brown rice, white rice and other grains will get keedas after two-three months and especially in the rains... because keedas too know that non-organic food is just not edible. So don't jump up and down when you see the worms; all you need to do is wash the grain or sun them out like our grandmothers would and still live on to a 100 years. Keedas don't contaminate your food, pesticides do. Similarly, if you see a few holes in the leaves of the greens you are buying, pick up the bunch; it means it is not heavily 'pesticided'. And one rule of thumb to follow with greens is this: after washing them well, give a final rinse of salt water for two-three minutes. This helps remove germs and residue.
Tasty
Natural is just tastier. When you cook organic vegetables, you will realise that you need less spices as there is so much natural flavour. Similarly, organic fruits are juicier as they are allowed to ripen on the tree. Otherwise, fruits are usually plucked when green and then gassed to ripen and increase shelf life. In the case of a banana, your taste buds will speak up because the pesticide fruit has more water due to the spraying of acetylene gas. Unfortunately, most mangoes today are artificially ripened and apples have the maximum pesticides. The adage 'an apple a day keeps the doctor away' is actually only for organic apples.
Healthier
Organic feels healthier, is far lighter on the digestive system and also helps reduce acidity and gas related GI issues. You will feel a perceptible difference soon enough.
The Smell Test
The aroma and texture of organic food is totally different  very potent, in fact. Organic spices, for instance, will have a strong aroma and flavour as they retain their oil content. In non-organic spices, the oils have been extracted and sold separately so they are devoid of any oil. Plus they are usually adulterated, so you need to use more to get the same result. Try ajwain/laung/zeera... just eat it raw and you'll know the difference. Your tongue will have a strong sensation after half a teaspoon of organic ajwain. Similarly, organic apples have a divine fragrance; keep a crate of organic apples in the house to find out.
One problem though is that industries now do a good job of recreating the original smell. The smell of pure ghee, for example, is added in the lab. Some just add the fragrance to make you think you are buying pure ghee, whereas you could actually be buying something totally nutritionless and worthless. So be careful.
Cook Faster
Organically grown food always cooks much faster; in fact if you are a multi-tasker, be careful as you might just burn the dish if you go out to peep in the garden while it is cooking. Food with pesticides needs to be cooked for much longer periods.
Read
Please read the label and check for any preservatives present in the product; most preservatives are petroleum based  you surely don't want to be consuming those!

Only 20 eateries obtain GMP certification islandwide
Only 20 eating houses have obtained the Good Manufacturing Practices (GMP) process certification from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI) although there are thousands of eating houses islandwide, Sri Lanka Standards Institution(SLSI) Senior Deputy Director Deepika Munaweera said.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, she said obtaining the GMP certificate was made compulsory for all eateries and catering services in the country with effect from January 1, 2017 in order to improve consumer food hygiene.
Unfortunately, none of welfare canteens in the state sector and over 6,000 school canteens islandwide have obtained the GMP certificate.
However,applications have been received only from 30 eating houses and catering services. But,according to the Gazette Notification issued on June 11,2015, no trader,caterer,supplier of processed food and/or any other person/persons shall engage in the business of mass catering and/or outdoor catering or other similar or connected activity/activities unless they obtain the GMP from the Sri Lanka Standards Institution (SLSI).
The GMP certificate ensures food cleanness, correct food separation, proper temperature of food and also personal hygiene practices.
We will conduct islandwide awareness programmes to educate owners of eating houses, canteens and catering services regarding this law.
Then, Consumer Affairs Authority investigating officers together with Public Health Inspectors (PHIs) of the Ministry of Health will carry out field investigations and take legal action against the errant owners of eating places and catering services, Munaweera said.
We are trying to implement this law to ensure consumer food safety.The direction covers a wide spectrum of food-related businesses including mass caterers and outdoor caterers.
This will ensure hygienic practices in all catering establishments and it applies to catering in hotels, restaurants and other institutions such as schools, hospitals, plants and factories.
Provisions are made for proper sanitary facilities and controls which include water supply, hand-washing
and toilet facilities, prevention of pests,drainage and waste disposal, living quarters and staff amenities, the SLSI Senior Deputy Director said.

SLITHM plays leading role  comforting Tourism Industry
With Sri Lanka achieving 2 million arrivals for the first time in its history last year and the numbers expected to grow this year, the countrys hospitality industry is facing the challenge of a serious manpower shortage.
However the countrys premier tourism and hospitality industry trainer is optimistic that the issue is well under control.
At the rate the hospitality industry has been expanding in the past few years it has no doubt been a challenge to prepare a skilled workforce to feed the industry.
It is therefore noteworthy that SLITHM, which is the premier national institution tasked with training personnel for the hospitality industry has taken up the challenge in a positive spirit by increasing its annual output without compromising on the quality of its products, noted Minister of Tourism Development, John Amaratunga speaking on the success of the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) which comes under the purview of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs.
SLITHM formerly known as the Ceylon Hotel School, has been in the forefront of training personnel for the hospitality industry across all levels from job specific craft courses to high caliber professionals not only to meet national demands but also global requirements.
In accordance with the 2016 Budget, 650 individuals were trained by private sector institutions under the guidance of the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs through SLITHM which monitored training quality and provided necessary resource assistance for the successful completion of the programmes.
Meanwhile keeping with industry requirements, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management developed a syllabus and introduced a specialized course in hospitality finance namely, Certified Hospitality Finance and Management Accountant Professional Qualification (CHFMA) in collaboration with the Institute of Certified Management Accountants (CMA) of Sri Lanka.
Marking a significant milestone, 131 fully fledged hospitality professionals graduated from SLITHM last year. This is the highest number of graduates to pass out from the institution in a single batch since its inception 50 years ago. All of these graduates have secured employment in senior management positions.
The professionally qualified faculty of SLITHM most of who are alumni of the institution, are constantly encouraged to further their education and are offered scholarships in countries such as the USA, China, Germany and Korea.
With Sri Lankas tourism industry moving in to top gear with the anticipated arrival of a number of new international hotel brands alongside a record number of visitors in 2017, SLITHM is poised to continue its leading role in guiding the destinies of the nations tourism and hospitality industry.

Women should get 25% representation
Nomination lists submitted for Municipal and Pradesheeya Sabha elections should contain 25 percent women representation.
If not such nomination lists are liable for rejection. A similar proposal is being considered for parliamentary elections too, Transport and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva said.
He was addressing an SLFP Women's organisation seminar at the Simon Pieris Hall, Badulla on February 19. Minister de Silva said politics today should be oriented to suit present times. A new era had dawned on the country after the 30-year-long war. War crimes allegations had been levelled against our country.
Northern Province Chief Minister Vigneswaran was demanding to include foreign judges in war crimes tribunal supported by certain bad eggs in the south, he said.
President Maithripala Sirisena and the SLFP led by him would never condone the inclusion of foreign judges on such a machinery. No room would be left for outsiders to meddle in our country's independence and sovereignty.
Recently Parliamentarian Udaya Gammanpila had alleged that the new Constitution was already drawn up and it was federal in nature from outside but not from inside, he said.
The minister said Gammanpila was highly mistaken because a new Constitution was not even on the drawing boards. The minister said he would categorically state this because he too was a member of the Constitutional Council. The SLFP would only support a Constitution which safeguards the country's unitary status and give the prominent place to Buddhism, the minister said.
The election manifesto of President Sirisena categorically stated that he would only support a new constitutional reforms which did not warrant a referendum.
Water Supply and Drainage State Minister Sudarshani Fernandopulle and State Minister Dilan Perera participated.

Additional food crops failing
A large number of paddy farmers in Anuradhapura who have started cultivating additional food crops due to the prevailing drought using limited water resources have fallen from the frying pan to the hearth as the seeds have failed without sprouting.
This issue was raised by the Inter Provincial Deputy Agriculture Director G. A. P. Wimalaratne at the district agriculture committee meeting, recently. He said paddy and other food crops including chili have been destroyed in large scale in the Anuradhapura district due to the severe drought.
Wimalaratne said the crop failure was due to seed varieties being bought by farmers from the open private seeds market which is not legally recommended. As such, the agriculture department cannot be held responsible for this loss, he pointed out.
Farmers despite the instructions of agriculture officials regarding the selection and sorting out of suitable seed varieties through workshops, seminars and illustrations are still buying seeds from the market despite warnings, he alleged.
Provincial Agriculture Director B. P. S. V. Pathirana said unwarranted illusive businesses are taking place in the seed market hoodwinking the farmer. He said these malpractices will stop once the Seeds Act is effective.

After Apple and Samsung, Xiaomi  to manufacture own chipsets
Six years ago, Chinese start-up, Xiaomi was known as an Apple rip-off. But within a few years they've gone from mimicking the Cupertino giant to actually beating it, at least at home. In 2015, Xiaomi overtook Apple to become the top smart phone selling company in China, which is also the biggest smartphone market of the world.
But holding on to the top spot was not easy. Xiaomi continued to face intense competition from both Apple and other Chinese smartphone manufacturers, and subsequently lost its top position among the top three smartphone manufacturers in China in the last quarter of 2016.
This, however, has not distracted Xiaomi from expanding its presence in other global markets. It registered second place in Indian smartphone sales, for Q4 2016.
To build on this growth, Xiaomi is planning to take a major step as a smartphone manufacturer. The company will soon launch its own line of chipsets, something that only three manufacturers have been able to accomplish so far - Huawei, Samsung and Apple.
Manufacturing chipsets not only allows smartphone makers to reduce the production costs, but also gives their software an edge over other manufacturers. Samsung and Apple have complete control over their chipset manufacturing, which is why they can frequently introduce new features that require special hardware.
Xiaomi has reportedly joined hands with Chinese chipset maker Leadcore to form a joint entity named Pinecone (a literal transalation of the Chinese name). Xiaomi will have a 51 per cent stake in the company.
The launch event is scheduled for the last day of this month. Earlier, it was expected that Xiaomi Mi5c will be the first device to sport a Pinecone chipset but a few reports from Gsmarena suggest that the device will come with Snapdragon 625 instead.
Globally, the company has resumed its expansion to new markets, starting with Pakistan.
The last time the company entered a major market was in 2015, when it launched its products in Brazil. Xiaomi's Mi5c and Mi6 are two phones expected to launch soon.

Annual Typo Day held in Sri Lanka
Typo Day 2017, an event meant to explore the finer aspects of typography and calligraphy, will be held for the first time in Sri Lanka from February 23 to 25.
Considered to be South Asias largest conference on typography and diversity, Typo Day 2017 is hosted by the Department of Integrated Design University of Moratuwa, Industrial Design Centre (IDC) Indian Institute of Technology Bombay (IIT Bombay), India Design Association (InDeAs) and Aksharaya.It will seek to address issues faced by type designers, type users and type educators.
Calligraphy is the art of drawing letters, words and phrases in certain ways using special pens and brushes that create abstract compositions with the drawn text; it is the basis at which the art and science of Typography is formed.
Typography is both an art and a science for designing and setting type or fonts for the alphabets of different languages; it looks not only at the design and style of a font but also how the type will appear in terms of spacing, dimensions and detailing of the letters. Today, most people with a background in modern design education understand that any form of branding or identity requires a thoughtful approach to typography and calligraphy, said Prof. Sumanthri Samarawickrama, Faculty, Department of Integrated Design, University of Moratuwa.
The opening day of the event will feature workshops in modern pointed-pen calligraphy and digital typography at the University of Moratuwa. These workshops are expected to provide attendees with high-quality tools so that they may cover the basics in practice strokes and technique. A colloquium on Research in Typography is also scheduled to take place.
To be held at the Western Province Aesthetic Resort (NADA), the conference will take place on the second and third days. The conference will be devoted to addressing issues faced by type designers, type users and type educators.

Anula Karunathilaka: The Dhammi of our sensibilities
Anula Karunathilaka is known more than anything else for depicting a lover who, regardless of the decades and generations that have since passed, epitomised our most heartfelt youthful interludes. At times she has been (unfairly, I believe) gauged on the merits of this one performance, and at times her other credits have been marginalised and understated.
But then Anula remains hard to define, harder to analyse, if at all because she was always an instinct-driven actress. When I first met her many, many years ago, she told me her story and how large a part coincidence played in her encounters, trials, tribulations, victories, and defeats.
Passing over the infinitely easier task of sketching out her biography, I asked her to start at the point her career began. That had been in 1962, the year her sister suggested that she send a photograph of hers to the Dawasa newspaper for a beauty queen contest. They had not however been published, which prompted the two of them and their father to visit the office and collect them.
What happened next A new photo of me was taken, she recalled, and it was published a little while later. I remember that I was in the top six when the votes were counted and I remember being taken in for the final contest.
That contest proved to be a turning point for her, because of two people attending it: Sumitra Peries (then Gunawardena) and Tissa Abeysekara, both of whom were to be involved in the first landmark film made here, Gamperaliya. A week later, Sugathapala de Silva and G. W. Surendra had come to ask her father as to whether she could be auditioned for a role in the film.
Did her father consent Not immediately, she smiled, Because you must remember, young girls were not supposed to act back then. The one point in my favour was the identity of the director. Even before Gamperaliya, Lester James Peries was reputed as an unconventional exponent of the cinema, who didnt go for the kind of commercial flicks girls like me were notoriously associated with. After much persuasion and because of this one point, my father relented. Soon enough, he and my sister were with me as we went to Dr Peries residence.
Seminal film
At his house, however, the man had seen Anula and had commented rather ruefully, My dear, you are too small. The role she had been asked to audition for had been that of Nanda, which would of course be filled in another girl who had already been featured in the cinema, Punya Heendeniya. For the moment Anula had been asked to audition with Gamini Fonseka, but eventually she had been given the role of Laisa, the servant-girl whose part was butchered in subsequent versions of Lesters seminal film. She tells me here, rather bitterly I infer, that out of the hundred or so copies that were made after its release only one remains which hasnt cut down on her screen time.
She was 16 when Gamperaliya was released. This was (still) in 1962. Her debut role in the cinema would soon be followed by a veritable series of stage plays, when in the following year Sugathapala de Silva took her in for his troupe Ape Kattiya and their first production, Dharmasiri Wickremaratnes Ran Thodu (where she was paired with G. W. Surendra and Tony Ranasinghe). Ran Thodu had been a controversial masterpiece, a watershed in the history of our theatre at a time when stylisation held sway everywhere, and Tony and her wound up as Best Actor and Actress at that years State Drama Awards Festival.
Her next foray into the cinema had been through Titus Thotawatte, who featured her as Sumana, the female protagonist, in his Chandiya, opposite Gamini Fonseka. The latter himself would feature her opposite him again in Parasathumal, where she connived rather menacingly and bitterly to undo the love triangle between Bonnie Mahaththaya (Fonseka), Tony Ranasinghe, and the woman at the centre of the storys conflict, Punya Heendeniya. Parasathumal moreover was released in 1967, the year she turned 21 on the day she signed a contract for her next big venture, Golu Hadawatha. It was with that seminal production that she got her career-defining role, as Dhammi Kariyawasam.
I believe it was Regi Siriwardena who commented that Karunasena Jayalath was responsible for the shift in our literature from Martin Wickramasinghe to pulp fiction. This was beyond a doubt facilitated by the mans own experiences, for his debut novel Golu Hadawatha (published in the same year Anula began her career, 1962) was rooted in his schoolboy days at Taxila Vidyalaya, Horana. I believe Anula summed up his attitude best: It was a different world back then, with a different way of responding to emotions. Today you come across unrequited lovers resorting to the knife and the gun in a bid to reclaim their love, but back then people transformed those sorrows and defeats into laments, dirges, and poetry.
Unrequited love
Because of this perhaps, those who read Karunasenas book grew to hate Dhammi, who in his novel had even less empathy that her onscreen avatar. People hated her character, but they never failed to tell me that they loved my performance as her, Anula told me. With vague and faint echoes of that other timeless tribute to unrequited love, Devdas, Golu Hadawatha proved to be a sensation, which meant that audiences were guaranteed for anyone who churned out a good, veritable, and reckonable film adaptation. This was exactly what Lester James Peries came up with in 1968, with the first of three films he made for Ceylon Theatres.
In Dhammi I come across a different Anula, the Anula who hid her emotions so well that in the final sequence relating her version of events, she let us know that she was not lacking in empathy. The first hour of Golu Hadawatha lets us in on Sugaths perspective, which is probably why, to intensify our sympathy for him, Lester went for Wickrema Bogoda. But the real star in the film without a doubt was Anula, who swayed between kelilol playfulness and bittersweet seriousness throughout the story in a way that added meaning to an already intense conflict.
Beach sequence
When we see her in that fateful beach sequence, for instance, telling Sugath that she never really loved him, we are confounded because, right until then, we had shared Sugaths feelings for her. It would take a tremendous effort to transform our hatred for her to empathy, which is what she achieved with that remarkable sustained sequence of her version of the story.
Golu Hadawatha wasnt her only film of course, and almost all her subsequent portrayals unearthed her versatility: in Ran Salu, for instance, she was both a freewheeling, materialistic woman and, towards the end, a serious and contemplative nun-to-be. Whether or not she would have continued this way, however and alas, is a question no one can answer, because owing to her marriage to the photographer Daya Wimalaweera she had to let go of her career in the cinema.
I have no regrets on that score, she told a very bewildered me, adding that she and Daya were always together until his demise many years ago. Incidentally, it was Wimalaweera who had taken the photograph of her at the Dawasa office. Small world, I thought to myself as I moved on.
Based on her responses to my other questions, I can say this about her later career. As Sunils mother in Amba Yahaluwo and as the mother to Kamal Addararachchi in Ran Diya Dahara, we come across a different Anula. She has by this point let go of her earlier avatar. Unlike most actresses her age who continued on with the cinema at this time (among them, Malini Fonseka and Geetha Kumarasinghe) she has refused to epitomise the youthfulness which virtually gushed from her in Parasathumal, Ran Salu, Golu Hadawatha, and Bakmaha Deege. She has become a matriarchal figure, prone to slight outbursts of temper, always suspicious, and never overfriendly.
There is one point that links both those aforementioned performances, however: the fact that even as a matriarch, she has to rely on a more powerful figure to assert herself: Maha Kumarihamy (Ruby de Mel) in Amba Yahaluwo, and the father to Kamal (Henry Jayasena) in Ran Diya Dahara. She of course continued to play the mother in several advertisements, but whether or not we could have continued with her film career this away, however and alas again, no one can answer.
I came across Anula for the first time as Sunils mother. Amba Yahaluwo was a prescribed text at my school, so watching it was vital for me to understand what I was reading. Regardless of how much screen time she was given and based on what I observed, therefore, I can say this much: the Anula Karunathilaka of the eighties had undergone a subtle but discernible shift. It is sad that she could not continue. We would have wanted her to. And we would have profited greatly.

Arjuna Ranatunga began trend of winning title twice
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year, during its four decades of cherished history, has produced top cricketers with different talent, abilities and from all parts of the country.
Winning the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title is the dream of every schoolboy cricketer, considering the milestone achievements of the past winners. Former Sri Lanka, NCC and Royal captain turned ICC Chief Match Referee Ranjan Madugalle remains the maiden recipient of that coveted title. But it was Sri Lankas world cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga who had the honour of winning the mega title twice for the first time in its history.
Besides Ranatunga, five other schoolboy cricketers have achieved this rare honour of winning the coveted award on two occasions  all five of them in successive years while Ranatungas feat had been achieved after a two years gap.
The left-handed middle order bat, as an outstsanding schoolboy cricketer from Ananda College, first won the prestigious title only in its second awards ceremony in 1980 after Madugalle. Two years later Ranatunga, as the captain of the Ananda first X1 team, won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer Award once again in 1982.
It was the beginning of Ranatungas illustrious career. Subsequently, he had the rare honour of leading the Sri Lanka national team which emerged champions at the 1996 World Cup tournament, beating Australia by seven wickets in the final play in Lahore on March 17, 1996.
However, former Nalanda captain turned ICC Match Referee Roshan Mahanama became the first to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in successive years. He performed this rare feat way back in 1983 and 1984. Since making his Sri Lanka debut as a proud product of Nalanda, Mahanama cemented his place in the national team in next to no time.
Apart from Ranatunga and Mahanama, only Thilan Samaraweera (1994 and 1995), Lahiru Peiris (2004 and 2005), Bhanuka Rajapaksa (2010 and 2011) and Charith Asalanka (2015 and 2016) have won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title two times each. The last of those six rare occasions was witnessed last year when Richmonds emerging hero Asanka won back to back titles.
Sri Lankas first and the most prestigious school cricket award show will be held for the 39th consecutive year, continuing the rich traditions maintained by the countrys flagship English newspaper, the Sunday Observer. Ever since its inception in 1979, at a time there had been no formal inter-school Under-19 tournament or a platform to showcase the most outstanding schoolboy cricketer, the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year event has unveiled many outstanding Sri Lanka cricketers who had made their presence felt in the international arena.
Joining the star parade in 1985 through the contest was reliable top order batsman Asanka Gurusinha, who could be easily rated as one of the most reliable one drop batsman that Sri |Lanka has ever produced. In fact, Gurusinha became the second Nalandian to win the title after Mahanama.
While the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continues to maintain its rich traditions, a couple of similar awards ceremonies have emerged in recent title. That alone is a great achievement for the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest as the game would be the eventual winner  giving more opportunities and awards to outstanding schoolboy cricketers. It is heartening to see others following the Sunday Observers great initiative the countrys budding schoolboy cricketers who would ultimately benefit from all these shows.
The Mother of all Shows - the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest continues for the 39th time, breaking new ground and a talent search for tomorrows cricketing heroes.
The prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Mega Awards ceremony has gone from strength to strength, since its inception way back in 1979. It has taken a giant leap forward especially during the last decade, largely due to the financial backing of the Sri Lanka Telecom Mobitel.
It is important that you vote for your favourite cricketer from your alma mater in the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest 2017 which is being conducted under three divisions. Voting coupons are now appearing in the Lake House national dailies  the Daily News, Dinamina, Thinakaran and the Sunday Observer.

Arrest, deterioration of moral values
It is unfortunately observed that in recent times there has been a serious deterioration in the moral standards of the country. Perhaps this is true not only of Sri Lanka but for most parts of the world. It is not only the number of cases of violence that is increasing rapidly but also the rising brutality of such incidence.
These phenomena in Sri Lanka considered the land of the Buddha where more than 2/3rd of the population comprises of Buddhists cannot be easily condoned. Some would say that with the increase of population and the greater media visibility the number of recorded crimes would naturally rise. However, leaving allowance for these factors, still crimes appear to be on the rise.
On the other hand, the brutality in killings is also increasing with the torturing of the victim prior to the killing. Eyes are removed, the tongues are cut and such kind of torture where the victim often appeals to the torturer to put a quick end to his life.
Dhamma sermons
In this situation the Buddhist monks has the capacity to play an important positive role, especially those monks in the rural areas where the relationship between the monks and the laity are strong and the people in the village are known to each other.
In this connection, it should be noted that Arahats, who have attained the supreme bliss of Nibbana, have an internal urge realizing how happy they are to encourage and help others to follow the path and achieve liberation.
Apart from exhorting the people to lead virtuous life at Dhamma sermons, the monks could play a more active part by visiting the areas where violence and even murders are likely to occur. News travels fast in the village and monks could personally visit likely explosive areas to desist those likely to engage in violence. They could play the role of honest mediators when violence and murders are likely to arise where they have built for themselves a reputation of being fair and just in all situations. If it is a family dispute pertaining to property they could be advised to seek the assistance of commissions and tribunals established by the Government consisting of honourable persons held in high regard by society.
Noble eightfold path
Different monks could and do specialize in different areas depending on their inclinations and aptitudes. Some would concentrate on their personal development to realize the Buddhist goal of Nibbana, the liberation from all the unsatisfactory features of life such as impermanence, unsatisfactoriness and the absence of a permanent, unchanging ego or self.
Some would be inclined to preach the Dhamma and induce people to follow the Noble eightfold path and realize early the freedom from Dukkha, the unsatisfactory aspects of life including old age, disease and death.
Reflecting the imminence of death which could be traumatic to some old people with rising agitation the main fear is the undiscovered country, to use a term from William Shakespeares Hamlet  his outstanding master piece.
One does not know what lies ahead after death. This would be especially so with those who have led unethical lives recollecting their past foul deeds.
In such situations some monks or even laymen with knowledge of the Dhamma could have the ability to calm the agitated and enable them to pass away somewhat peacefully.
For those who have led reasonably good and fair lives with consideration for the welfare of others and society, they could be reminded of their good deeds which would give them confidence to face death and beyond.
On the other hand, for those who had led not so ethical lives, they could be told not to think of ones bad actions because as the Buddha explained there is nothing that could be done to eliminate what has already been done.
However they could establish a firm determination not to do unwholesome actions even in the few days of available life with thoughts of goodwill and best wishes to all living beings- mankind, animals and even invisible beings. A mind full of such thoughts would be an asset at the time of death.
Thus, the monks have a vital role to protect and advance the moral standards of the people and the ability to enable them to exist from this life calmly and gracefully.
May all beings be well and happy.

Authentically academic
Title: Academic Challenges and Reflections
Author: Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage
This book is a collection of articles and poems published by Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage in the daily and Sunday newspapers, for a number of years. It has thirty four articles and ten poems worth reading especially by the intelligentsia in the country.
The newspaper articles are generally considered non-academic. Therefore, they are not taken into account in promotions of the Universities and the Institutes. This is a worldwide phenomenon. However, the articles collected in this book are quite different from the articles generally published in the newspapers. The reason for this is that the articles in this book are scholarly, controversial and research related.
The articles of the book deal with a variety of subjects written on various fields of academic interest. Among them the noteworthy subject areas are history, grammar, Buddhist Studies, education, biographical sketches, aesthetics, Sinhala literature (ancient and modern), anthropology, sociology and linguistics. This showed the versatility of the author. These articles cannot be written by a person who is not well versed in various oriental and occidental languages. I personally know that Dr Gemunu Siri Gamage has a thorough knowledge of Pali and Sanskrit in addition to the Sinhala language and of English too. His ac academic qualifications stand testimony to this effect. My point here is that the articles collected in the book could not have been written by a pseudo-scholar, as many books written, especially in Sinhala language, in modern Sri Lanka. There are those who begin their career by publishing a book or two. Dr Gamage reminds us of them with the lesson that genuine knowledge of languages, Liberal Arts and an experience running through many decades are necessary to write a book of quality which would bring knowledge and authority in academic fields.
Most of the articles found in this book transcend the traditional ideas and concepts believed for centuries in Sri Lanka. Therefore, all articles written by Dr Gamage and collected in this book lead us to a world of new facts hitherto unknown even for the scholars. Articles 1, 3, 5, 6, 10, 11, 18 and 27 are specifically noteworthy in this regard. Dr Gamage unravels the hidden information, historical or otherwise, which would shake our knowledge. I give below some of the new concepts that Dr Gamage emphasizes in this book.
1. The name of Sri Lanka itself indicates our relationship to the clan of Yakkhas.
2. the authorship of the Paritta discourses cannot be attributed to the Buddha.
3. the colloquial Sinhalese can be evaluated as a source of Anthropology.
4. Prince Rahula belongs to the Raghuvamsa, a lineage of Kings well known in the Indian traditions.
5. The Jatakas as the ultimate example of the tradition of Buddhist Poetry can be well established.
6. The relationship between the early inhabitants of Sri Lanka and the Australian aborigines is a historical fact based on the linguistic evidence.
7. The correct meaning of the Pali term Migava and its importance in relation to the story of King Devanampiyatissa is emphasized.
8. The Sinhalese term gani derives not from the Sanskrit term but from the Greek term gyne.
Dr Gamage has paid attention to felicitate well-known figures who lived in the recent past of Sri Lanka. They are Sarathchandra, Manawasinghe and Ven Medauyangoda Wimalakirthi. The unknown information of these great individuals are beautifully presented by Dr Gamage in this book. His personal experiences too are presented in evaluating the greatness of these scholars. These biographical sketches seem to be a source of information which would enhance the inquisitive nature of any individual of present Sri Lanka. Dr Gamages thirst for knowledge at the early years of his career is well documented in these articles. In this regard, I would like to mention that the literature of Biographies occupies a major branch of information especially in the Western World. Dr Gamages small effort towards this expanding branch of literature should be appreciated. Writing of Biographies was not considered as an essential part of Literature in ancient Sri Lanka. Dr Gamage has gone against the traditional approach here, as he had done elsewhere too in this book.
This book becomes richer by the message of the Most Ven Ittapana Dhammalankara. In addition the short appreciation of Professor Saman Chandra Ranasinghe and the introduction given by Professor K N O Dharmadasa adorn the book. Their coming forward to evaluate this collection of articles itself indicates how much Dr Gamage has contributed to expand our knowledge.
Finally, I would like to state with firm conviction that the Academic Challenges and Reflections is a source of information and knowledge beneficial to the nation which does not know where it should go. All those who are sensitive to various historical, literary and linguistic aspects of modern Sri Lanka should read this book.

Bangladesh recall Mustafizur for Lanka Tests
DHAKA, Tuesday  Bangladesh on Tuesday recalled their left-arm fast bowler Mustafizur Rahman in a 16-man squad for the upcoming two-Test series in Sri Lanka after his prolonged injury lay-off.
The 21-year-old has not played a Test since his debut series against South Africa in 2015 after suffering a series of injuries. He underwent surgery on his shoulder last year.
While he made a brief return to the limited-overs side against New Zealand at the turn of the year, he was not deemed fit enough to withstand the rigours of a five-day Test match.
Bangladesh are due to play two Tests against the Sri Lankans -- one in Galle from March 7-11 and another in the capital Colombo which starts on March 15 and will be their 100th Test match.
They are then scheduled to play three 50-over ODIs before facing off for two Twenty20 international matches at the tailend of the tour, which wraps up on April 6.
The selectors also handed fast bowler Rubel Hossain a recall after he was ignored for Bangladeshs recent defeat in a one-off Test against India, meaning there are five pacemen in the squad.
We think we would require an extra pacer in testing conditions in Sri Lanka, said chief selector Minhajul Abedin.
Opening batsman Imrul Kayes was not named in the squad after he failed to recover sufficiently from a thigh injury picked up in India. But Abedin said he could be called up for the second Test if he regains fitness.
Squad: Mushfiqur Rahim (capt), Tamim Iqbal, Soumya Sarkar, Mominul Haque, Mahmudullah Riyad, Shakib Al Hasan, Sabbir Rahman, Liton Das, Taijul Islam, Taskin Ahmed, Kamrul Islam, Mustafizur Rahman, Mehedi Hasan, Mosaddek Hossain, Subashis Roy and Rubel Hossain. AFP

Boat left sans approval
The ill-fated multi-day fishing boat IMUL-A-627-KLT had not obtained approval from authorities at the Beruwala Fisheries Harbour prior to its departure on the pilgrimage, investigations revealed.
The boatmen had not sought approval as it was not a fishing expedition, according to the report on the investigations handed over to Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera by Fisheries Director General Christy Lal Fernando on February 20.
The report had been compiled by the Kalutara Additional Director of Fisheries who conducted the investigation. It also stated that over 35 passengers had been travelling in the boat when it capsized. The boat was unsuitable for passenger transport as it was meant for fishing purposes. The undercarriage of the boat was designed to facilitate ice, fuel and the catch, and it was designed to carry a limited weight.

Watering holes
A landmark Indian Supreme Court decision in December 2016 somehow missed out on being reported in our mainstream media. The judgement banned the sale of liquor along all highways and roads throughout India including those that fell within municipal limits. Inter alia the petition contended that 400 deaths take place every single day on Indian roads caused mostly by drunken driving.
Evidence of the earliest use of alcohol in the form of fermented grain spirals back to 7000BC and theres no disputing the fact that alcohol will be consumed by mankind till the end of time. But it is indeed sad that, manufacturers of spirits never wholeheartedly promote responsible consumption nor do they issue warnings that, their products should not be used as a crutch for poor coping skills. Or, where one can seek help if you are unlucky to become dependent on their product! Is it asking for too much
Millions of people enjoy social interaction glass in hand or a pre-dinner tot (or two) at home somewhat comfortably. But there are millions who are either tottering at the edge or engulfed already in the throes of addiction causing misery and destroying the fabric and souls of their families. It is then left to the very few low key organisations to attempt to rescue, counsel and rehabilitate them.
Sri Lankan roads are dotted with Wine Stores but what worries me is why they open at 9 a.m. Do such opening times promote the use of alcohol as a crutch to those who are vulnerable It certainly does, and it is plain to see if you care to observe the two legged traffic to and fro, pre noon and early post noon.
Some checks and balances could be initiated even though it will cause an uproar, strikes by wine store owners and immediate condemnation from the Joint Opposition. I propose the shutters should open at 5 p.m. and promise not to petition the Supreme Court.

CNCI "Achiever Awards 2017" on August 17
The Ceylon National Chamber of Industries - (CNCI) will conduct its "CNCI Achiever Awards 2017" on August 17 at Hotel Galadari.
This is a unique event where the CNCI, the premier Industrial Chamber in the country identifies and recognizes the Sri Lankan Industrialists for their achievements both in the manufacturing and service sectors.
The Achiever Awards have been designed by the CNCI to promote industrial growth in the country by recognizing and rewarding those industrialists who have excelled well in their businesses in the areas of quality standards, productivity, employee benefits, labour relations etc while assuring concerns over the social and environmental obligations and to encourage these enterprises to reach further heights in their spheres of operations.
This is a valuable opportunity for all industrial settings of Extra Large, Large, Medium, Small & Micro categories in the country to know their own stand in respective industries in the provincial and National levels. We are certainly proud to mention that the CNCI Achiever Awards Competition has been able to produce a number of industrialists to the country who have become highly reputed and leading businessmen in Sri Lanka today.

These are, of course, the success stories behind the Achiever Awards Event organized by the CNCI.
We have also planned an awareness campaign through some selected regional chambers covering all parts of the island, giving special emphasis to the North and East, which are considered as 'special districts'.

Contempt of Court proceedings against Namal terminated
The Supreme Court yesterday decided to terminate Contempt of Court proceedings filed against Hambantota District Parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa following his undertaking that he would cooperate with the investigations carried out by Bribery Commission.
MP Namal Rajapaksa gave this undertaking when the Contempt of Court action filed by Bribery Commission that he had allegedly disrespected the authority of the Bribery Commission by failing to appear before the Commission without reasonable cause was taken up for mention.
Expressing the opinion of the Bribery Commission, Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam with Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle informed Court that Namal Rajapaksa had given statements to the Bribery Commission on February 15 and 20. They requested Court to make an appropriate order.
Therefore, the Supreme Court three-judge-bench comprising Chief Justice K. Sripavan, Justice Priyasath Dep and Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare decided to terminate Contempt of Court proceedings against Namal Rajapaksa and further ordered him to cooperate with the ongoing investigations. A charge sheet filed by Bribery Commission against Namal Rajapaksa was readout in the Supreme Court on a previous occasion. However, MP Namal Rajapaksa, the elder son of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa pleaded not guilty to the charges when the charges filed against him were read out by the Registrar of the Supreme Court. On a previous occasion, the SC served a charge sheet on Hambantota District MP Namal Rajapaksa regarding the complaint.
The former CIABOC Director General had filed a complaint in the SC against MP Namal Rajapaksa for allegedly disrespecting the authority of the Bribery Commission by failing to appear before the Commission without reasonable cause and failing to produce an affidavit in connection with an investigation on the assets of the MP.
In her complaint, former CIABOC Director General Dilrukshi Dias Wickremasinghe PC requested the Supreme Court that proceedings against NamalRajapaksa be initiated for the offence of Contempt under Article 105(3) of the constitution.
The complainant maintained that the CIABOC commenced an investigation on the assets of Rajapaksa which would be an indictable offence under Section 23 of the Bribery Act, if the investigation reveals evidence to substantiate an offence of bribery. The complainant stated that as part of a routine investigation step and for the purpose of ascertaining the truth of the matter being investigated, respondent Namal Rajapaksa was required by notice December 14, 2015 to produce an affidavit by January 20, 2016 under section 5(1)(g) of the CIABOC.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam with Deputy Solicitor General Nerin Pulle appeared for the CIABOC.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with Ali Sabry PC and counsel Navin Marapana appeared for Namal Rajapaksa.

Dangers of Online Anonymity, Fake News, and Online Hate
The Associated Papers of Ceylon Limited (ANCL), (Lake House) yesterday held the D.R. Wijewardene Memorial Panel Discussion entitled: The Dangers of Online Anonymity, Fake News, and Online Hate"
The lecture took place at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. It marked the 131st anniversary of the birth of Wijewardene, the founder of the Lake House.
The five panelists, who hailed from both private and state media bodies, wrestled with the definition and relative danger of fake news.
Before we discuss fake news, we have to figure out how it is different from false news or bad journalism. For me, the objective of fake news is to earn money by getting more hits. At the bottom of fake news, there are money and power, Rasika Jayakody of The Daily News said.
Umair Wolid of the Wijeya Newspapers, concurred with Jayakody, but also added that fake news is meant to intentionally mislead, whereas bad journalism misleads unintentionally due to a lack of fact checking or poor practice on the part of journalists.
Indi Samarajiva of YAMU, played devils advocate by briefly arguing that fake news can, in certain instances, lead to positive outcomes.
Lets think back to the story of Rajapaksa sending several Lamborghinis out of the country. This story turned out to be either untrue or un-provable, but it did help get rid of Rajapaksa, so can we say it was such a bad story Samarajiva queried.
The panelists discussed the economic aspect of fake news, touching on the fact that new media companies make a mint on it.
For all the complaining about Trump, he made media companies a lot of money. Facebook and Google are making a huge amount from fake news, while old media bodies point to the importance of facts, Samarajiva said.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has informed the Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama to take disciplinary action against the Coordinating Officer of the Vision 2020 Programme for providing information to media, according to the Health Ministry Media Secretary.
The Minister had stated that the doctor who coordinated the Vision 2020 programme was not an ophthalmologist but an ordinary doctor.
Senaratne pointed out that some officials think that the positions received by them are their own private properties and do not like to let go. The Vision 2020 Programme has not abolished and the programme is continuing by the College of Ophthalmologists in Sri Lanka.
Minister Senaratne also stated that in the past surgeries carried out by the Vision 2020 programme were not done by its officials but were done by qualified Ophthalmologists.
However, later the Health Ministry had
taken over the programme and did not offer patient high quality eye lenses. Instead it provided low cost lenses, he said.

Domestic cricket in chaos
Domestic cricket in Sri Lanka has been thrown into chaos with Sri Lanka Cricket unable to get their much vaunted and spendthrift Major limited-over tournament off the ground when Negombo Cricket Club obtained a stay order last Friday to suspend the tournament because of their unfair exclusion from it.
The much hyped Major limited overs tournament was launched in a glitzy ceremony at R Premadasa Stadium last week with estimated costs running to over Rs. 5 million according to reliable sources.
Dunstan Goluhewa, president of Negombo CC relating the events that led to them obtaining an interim injunction against SLC going ahead with the tournament told the Daily News: We played the 2015/16 Sara trophy final against Sebastianites in August and lost it by 52 runs. Subsequently it was brought to our notice that Sebastianites had played six higher division players in their team and we lodged a protest regarding that.
The interim committee under Sidath Wettimuny which was running SLC at the time inquired into our protest and found that Sebastianites were guilty of the offence and afterwards awarded us the Sara trophy which brought us promotion to play in Tier B of the Premier tournament for 2016/17. This was confirmed to us by letter by SLC. Prior to the start of the 2016/17 season we were called up for the fixtures meeting for the Premier Tier B 3-day Emerging tournament and subsequently issued match fixture schedules for the Major limited 50-over and Major T20 tournaments. We were also presented with a cheque for Rs 1.6 million for expenses during the season by SLC. We were due to play our first match in the Premier Tier B but the first weekend of matches was washed out by bad weather.
In the meantime Sebastianites had filed a court case against SLC asking to be reinstalled as Sara trophy champions of 2015/16. The court requested SLC to intervene and settle the issue. The SLC tournament committee requested us to replay the final after one year and six months (which was a joke) to which we refused. The SLC subsequently withdrew us from participating in the 2016/17 Premier Tier B tournament.
The Premier Tier B tournament went ahead without us. We filed action in the Colombo District Court against the decision to deprive us of playing and sought an order to make the Premier Tier B tournament null and void. The case is due to be taken up on March 3. Subsequently we were also kept out of the two Major tournaments (limited over and T20) which the SLC is due to conduct this month. We obtained a stay order from the Colombo District Court on our unfair exclusion from these tournaments and SLC have been informed by the court to show sufficient reasons for keeping us out and given time till February 23 to file their answers. The action of the SLC has deprived our club and players whom we recruited because of our promotion from showcasing their talent and gaining national recognition.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva confirmed that they had been informed by court that there is an interim injunction brought against SLC conducting the major one-day tournament and that the matches scheduled for Saturday did not take place.
We are waiting for a written confirmation on the interim injunction to make an official statement, said De Silva.
The SLC are already under a cloud with a case of match-fixing in the Premier Tier B league tournament between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC being investigated by a three-member panel. The allegation brought against the two clubs by Sri Lanka Ports Authority CC (SLPA) is that the match was fixed to allow Panadura SC to emerge victorious and become champions of Premier Tier B which would automatically grant them promotion to Tier A the following season and also bigger funds from SLC. It was more of a win-win situation where in return Kalutara PCC were also given the opportunity to avoid relegation to a lower division. According to sources, on a rain-hit final day both Panadura and Kalutara teams had lost 24 wickets and had recorded a run rate of over 10 runs per over.
It has been revealed that in 20 minutes, 13 overs have been bowled allowing Panadura to chase a target of 165 within a mere 13.4 overs scoring at a run rate of 12.21 per over. SLPA who were also in the running to win the Tier B title but failed, allege that due to the tactics adopted by the two teams they have been deprived of the honour and promotion.
The scores of that first-class match: Kalutara PCC 390 in 103 overs and 197 in 22.5 overs; Panadura SC 423 in 68.3 overs and 167-7 in 13.4 overs. The match officials were: Jayantha de Silva and Gamini Dissanayake (umpires) and SM Faumi (match referee).
SLC vice president K. Mathivanan who is also the Head of Domestic Cricket assured that the culprits will be brought to book and that justice will be done. The ICCs Anti-Corruption officer Lakshman de Silva is leading the prosecution. We dont want to rush it and allow room for either partys to go to courts and make a mockery out of this whole thing. The report once it is ready will be presented to the ExCo for a final decision, said a determined Mathivanan who wants to see proper justice done in the name of cricket.

Ecoclean, AIE work together to deliver  World Class Quality Standards
Sustainability is fast becoming, a globally recognized phrase. Sustainable consumer goods are becoming increasingly critical both in the industrial and domestic sectors which means that large scale industries and hotels today, are being pressurized to embrace sustainable cleaning methods which are safer for the environment, their consumers and staff.
Sri Lanka's retail industry is fast catching up on these global trends. Brands such as Ecoclean who recently entered the local market, today have become Leaders in their field, with their excellent range of retail products which adhere to the highest environmental standards and are safe for use by anyone. Their products are purchased by many top companies in Sri Lanka, and adorn the shelves of most of the leading supermarket chains.
In order to achieve ISO 14000 standards, they recently engaged the services of the Quality Consultants - Asian Institute of Excellence (AIE) - to analyse and improve quality standards within their factory and warehouse. AIE undertook a full review of all their processes and monitoring mechanisms and introduced Good Manufacturing Practicesguidelines across the board. The improvements included optimal factory and warehouse layouts to minimize wastes and costs. The benefits of these changes will be felt both immediately and in the medium term, through sustainable business practices, reduced waste, fewer breakdowns, significantly less down time, recyclable materials and improved use of the 3 R concept ( Reduce, Re-Use, Re-cycle). The increased efficiency and minimizing ofcosts are benefits of this exercise, which will be passed on to the consumer in terms of price and quality.
According to the COO, R Saban, The concept of eco and safer hygiene products are very popular in the Western world and these products follow stringent standard procedures from inbound logistics to the consumer. Our products are made from raw materials supplied by world renowned companies. In Sri Lanka, Ecoclean is in the forefront of developing this green category and is investing and catering for the niche market, to communicate the benefit and awareness of these products.

The rupee on Monday strengthened for the second straight session, gaining by another 9 paise to close at 66.92 per dollar in view of strong foreign capital inflows coupled with firm equity market.
The rupee resumed lower at 67.06 per dollar as against the last Friday's closing level of 67.01 at the Interbank Foreign Exchange market on initial demand for the American currency from banks and importers but recovered afterwards to 66.90 before ending at 66.92, showing a gain of 9 paise, or 0.13 per cent. The domestic currency gained by 15 paise, 0.21 per cent, in two days.
The domestic unit hovered in the range of 67.07-66.90 per dollar during the day.
The dollar index was trading up by 0.11 per cent against a basket of six currencies.
In the overseas market, the dollar rose against the yen in the late afternoon trade, but was largely flat against other major crosses, with investors reluctant to take strong positions due to the US national holiday for Presidents Day.
The dollar gained only moderately against the yen as Japanese corporate players bought the greenback for the purpose of commercial trade settlement in the mid-morning session. But a lack of fresh trading cues gave no clear direction to the US currency.
Foreign portfolio investors (FPIs) bought shares worth a net Rs 8,043.14 crore. (Times of India)

This monthly change was due to the increases of expenditure value of food items by 0.78% and non-food items by 0.35% respectively.
The increase in expenditure value of food commodity group in January 2017 compared to that of December 2016 was due to the price increases in rice, coconuts, banana, coconut oil, green chilies, sugar, fresh fish, papaw, dried fish, potatoes and garlic.

A German Expatriate attached to GITEC a consultancy firm involved in the construction of the Karapitiya Maternity Hospital Project is alleged to have assaulted a lady Secretary in Public. She was later admitted to the Karapitiya hospital for treatment, an official attached to project told the Daily News. Doctors after medical investigations have said her muscle tissues have been damaged. When I ask the lady as to how this incident happened she said, Our team Leader asked me to make a new appointment with a lawyer who is practicing in Colombo by cancelling the earlier appointment that he had been made with the Lawyer and extend it to the following Monday.
Although it is the responsibility of his personal assistant who is an Ethiopian lady, whom he called his fiancee, she could not handle it because her English knowledge is poor. Her work load too was handled by me even though she is drawing a higher salary paid out of Government money obtained for the Karapitiya Maternity hospital project, she said.
Although I tried my best to contact the Lawyer my attempts failed because the lawyer was in Court. When tried to explain the difficulty to contact the Lawyer, suddenly he jumped on me and started blaming me in indecent language. I was frightened and tried to escape from him but he grabbed me by my neck and pushed me out of the door abusing me in slang, the victim explained.

GMOA will take stern union action if SAITM issue not solved soon
All Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) members will not hesitate to take stern trade union action and use the organisations' full power by launching a island-wide strike to solve the SAITM issue if the Government does not solve it soon, GMOA Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, Dr. Ananda said the Uva Province GMOA took trade union actions yesterday and did not carry out ordinary services from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon, and they decided to continue it till 8.00 am today. This is the province where halting medical service can cause minimum damage. Country has eight more provinces. This is not an island-wide strike. The GMOA compelled to take this minor union action because of the silence of the Government in solving the SAITM issue.
According to Dr. Ananda, the GMOA is doing this to safeguard patients' lives and not for doctors' benefit. Therefore, the GMOA confirms that all emergency, maternity, pediatric care services, kidney treatment, cancer and so on will not be affected by any union actions. People have already understood the risk they are going to face due to the SAITM issue. Nobody can let a minister or anyone else to put the patient's lives at risk.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said it is the time the health Minister to prove his neutral position and show that he is not biased towards the SAITM. He can simply do this by signing the Gazette Notification on minimum standards of medical education. Students intake for the SAITM take place once in every six month and it is hilarious to stop it for six months.

Hambantota still underdeveloped despite producing a President
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said he was surprise that the state hospitals in the Hambantota district are still not developed in spite of the district having produced a President, Economic Development Minister and a member of Parliament.
According to Minister Senaratne, the Tangalle base hospital is located opposite the house of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa but there are many shortcomings in it. This happens when decisions are being made based on political agendas.
It was decided to construct a 10 storeyed building for the Tangalle Hospital. All hospitals in the Hambantota district will be developed by this government, said Senaratne. He was addressing the inauguration of the new provincial blood transfusion centre at Tangalle hospital and engaging in an inspection tour.
He pointed out that it is appropriate to take over some base hospitals because there are shortcomings and issues in them. Some are staff issues and financial issues in hospitals administrated by Provincial Councils.
He noted that it is difficult for the Provincial Councils to manage them.
A project on effectively managing clinical waste of state hospitals is now in progress in the Colombo district with the assistance of a local company. An Australian company has proposed to implement a similar project for all other state hospitals, the Minister added.

Help where its due
School children should not only indulge in their day to day educational activities, but also they must know about the value of learning ethics which helps to improve their moral principles to become viable citizens in the society.
These are some of the comments made by Principal, Angel International School, Manipay, Jaffna, Dr. Noel Vimalendran during an awareness programme, conducted for schoolchildren on the `Value of Elders. HelpAge Sri Lanka, Youth Education Division sponsored the programme.
Making an emotional speech on elders, Principal Vimalendran highlighted the hardships faced by many Senior Citizens in the country due to lack of attention paid by others .
He also commended the invaluable service rendered by HelpAge Sri Lanka (HASL) towards such underprivileged citizens and said even the children of Angel International School are taught to care one another like HelpAge encourages children to help elders.
Addressing over 800 students, Principal Vimalendran stressed the importance of treating Senior Citizens considering that they shed sweat and toil to develop our motherland in the past. In addition to school children, teachers and staff members, HelpAge officials Geethal Mendis, Lionel Premachandra and Ananda Kannangara were also present on the occasion.
The Principal also called upon students of Angel International school to entertain elders during their twilight days without isolating them by sending them to elders homes.
As the concept of HelpAge Sri Lanka, it is also our paramount duty to help elders to lead dignified ,secure, active and healthy lives considering that these citizens are not a burden but a valuable asset in a society,.
He also called upon countrywide schools to be partners of this programme and requested HelpAge to conduct such programmes in other schools too. After listening to the emotional speech made by the Principal on the value of elders, a teacher of Angel International School volunteered herself to extend services to HelpAge work in the future.
HelpAge Youth Education Director Geethal Mendis explained the school children on social work rendered by HelpAge to uplift the living standards of underprivileged Senior Citizens by providing them with free medical services, free cataract surgeries and also financial assistance to engage in livelihood activities.
Director Mendis also quoted several leading personalities in the international arena including the former American President Barack Obama and said how he looked after his grandmother until her demise.
He said even the late British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher once said that everybody in todays world should think that we all are getting old one day and therefore we should learn to help each other from younger days.
Therefore, I would once again make a fervent request from all students to treat their elders considering it as a noble cause, he added.

Hong Kongs Beef Ball takes bite out of gender gap
Hong Kong: Hong Kongs Chan Yuen-ting will smash another hole through footballs glass ceiling when she makes history in the AFC Champions League on Wednesday -- but it couldnt be a tougher debut for the trailblazing female coach.
Chan, nicknamed Beef Ball and just 28 years old, will etch her name in the record books as the first woman worldwide to lead a professional mens team into continental competition, at the helm of Hong Kongs Eastern.
The game is not far from Hong Kong, in southern mainland China -- but it is against Guangzhou Evergrande, the mega-rich Manchester United of Asia with two Champions League titles and six straight domestic trophies to their name.
But for Chan, who last year became the first female coach to win a top-flight mens league, it will be an honour to face Evergrande and their World Cup-winning manager, Brazils Luiz Felipe Scolari. I never imagined or expected this could happen but now were going to play against him so I feel excited and Im looking forward to meeting him, she told the Asian Football Confederation (AFC) website.
All I need to do is focus on our team and concentrate on the work that we are doing. Chans ground-breaking 2016 Hong Kong title with Eastern made headlines around the globe, and earned her the AFCs coach of the year award and a place in a BBC list of the worlds 100 most influential women.
Eastern then became Hong Kongs first club to be handed an automatic berth in the Champions League group stage, thanks to the recent performances of the citys teams in AFC competitions. AFP

Started as a mansion apartment complex during Colonial era, Nippon is one of the oldest buildings in the vicinity is now open for business and has undergone a complete renovation, whilst maintaining the old exterior, the interior is all brand new, apart from a few ornamental and iconic pieces from its past.
Hotel Nippon has undergone a complete face-lift and change of Status. It has been given the care and attention that any Heritage property deserves.The investment towards its renovation has amounted close to Rs.400 million and it has taken two years for it.The building was first built as Manning Mansions; apartments for the British during their rule.
It was then converted to Hotel Polski briefly and then Hotel Nippon. Since the civil unrest in the 1980s and subsequent
war that followed, the hotel had fallen into a state of dormancy and mismanagement.
It is currently owned by 4 brothers, V. K. Chandrasena, V.K. Vasan, Dr.V.K. Valsan and the late V.K. Prasannan (all sons of the late Vethody Kumaran). Dr. V.K. Valsan spearheaded the renovation.

They have maintained some key elements of the buildings history, like the 130-year-old Burma Teak Staircases that runs through two areas of the building and the 130-year-old Antique Seth Thomas grandfather clock. The iron beams that run through the skeletal structure of the building are all still in place since the time Nippon was first built as Manning Mansions and in fact have embossed seals on them that state their factory of origin - All from England during the mid-1800s (19th Century). All
though these are not visible right now, they are very much restored and still what keeps this magnificent building intact at its core.
At the KAF we want to focus on providing the best quality at the quoted price range. All our items (including our bread) are made in-house and we have two Chefs from Kerala, who provide Kerala Snacks and meals to ourgradually expanding menu, Hotel official said.

India pulls off thrilling last-ball win over SA
Stand-in captain Harmanpreet Kaur lifted India to a thrilling last-ball victory over South Africa in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup Qualifier 2017 at the P. Sara Oval yesterday.
Set to chase 245, India had all but lost its way after a flurry of wickets but Kaur kept her cool to score the nine runs required off the last over from pace bowler Marcia Letsoala.
With just one wicket in hand and only one run scored off the first four deliveries, India did not have much going for it but Kaur heaved a six over the mid-wicket fence off the penultimate delivery and then a lofted shot towards long on brought the two runs required off the last ball. Rajeshwari Gayakwad scampered home to complete the double as other Indian players ran on to the ground in celebration of a memorable win.
It was a creditable win because India was without captain and star batter Mithali Raj due to a hamstring pull suffered during the previous match against Pakistan, while already missing pace bowler Jhulan Goswami and opener Smriti Mandhana due to injuries ahead of the tournament.
India had gone into the match with a slight edge as it had beaten South Africa by 49 runs in a Super Six match and possessed a battery of slow bowlers who had looked capable of bothering the opposition but South Africa had seized the initiative early on with some fine batting.
Openers Lizelle Lee (37) and Laura Wolvaardt (21) added 51 runs in 10 overs to put South Africa on road to a big total even as the Indian bowlers struggled to slow the flow of runs. Lee was quick to despatch anything loose over the infield, smashing three fours and three sixes off 31 balls.Mignon du Preez (40), van Niekerk (37) and Sune Luus (35) all found ways to counter the Ekta Bisht-led spin attack.
India and South Africa, along with Sri Lanka and Pakistan, have qualified for the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 in which they will join Australia, England, New Zealand and the West Indies. The four top teams from the tournament also made the ICC Womens Championship while the top six  Ireland and Bangladesh being the other two teams  are assured of ODI status for the next four-year cycle.
Scores:
South Africa 244 in 49.4 overs (Mignon du Preez 40, Lizelle Lee 37, Dane van Niekerk 37, Sune Luus 35, Rajeshwari Gayakwad 3/51, Shikha Pandey 2/41).
India 245-9 in 50 overs (Deepti Sharma 71, Mona Meshram 59, Harmanpreet Kaur 41 n.o., Veda Krishnamurthy 31, Marizanne Kapp 2/36, Aiyabonga Khaka 2/55).

Ivanka Trump steps into role behind her father

On Monday evening, as word spread of yet more anti-Semitic behavior around the nation, it wasn't President Donald Trump who was the first to speak out against the threats to regional Jewish Community Centers  it was his daughter, Ivanka Trump.
Like her dad, however, she used Twitter to remind her followers that the United States is a "nation built on religious tolerance" and that it's important to protect houses of worship. It isn't unusual for Ivanka, who, along with her husband Jared Kushner, identifies as an Orthodox Jew, to speak out on such a heartfelt issue. But the President's daughter has picked up where she left off on the campaign trail  as the softer, gentler side of her father's gruff demeanor.
Whether handling topics like women in business, as she did when she convened aroundtable with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeauto help "level the playing field" for female entrepreneurs and working parents, or acting asde factofirst lady and accompanying her father on a trip to comfort the family of a fallen soldier, Ivanka has been the humanizing force of the Trump administration.
President Trump and Ivanka walk toward Marine One while departing from the White House enroute to Dover Air Force base pay respects to Chief Special Warfare Operator William "Ryan" Owens, who was killed during a raid in Yemen.
The barriers of privacy that shrouded the children of Barack and Michelle Obama don't apply to Ivanka, nor does she seem to want them for her own three children. From videos of her daughter singing pop songs in the backseat of her car to showing off baby Theodore's first crawl in the White House's State Dining Room, nothing seems off-limits.
Lately, Ivanka's Twitter and Instagram feeds have been a mash-up of her personal and professional life, with the possible aim of letting her millions of followers see her close relationship with her father and, in turn, his with her own children.
"Grandpa Trump" became a thing last week when the President walked toward Marine One from the Oval Office, clasping both hands of his grandkids, 5-year-old Arabella and 3-year-old Joseph.
Arabella and Joseph had just watched the giant helicopter land on the lawn, staring out the windows of the Oval Office.
On Tuesday morning, following her previous night's tweet calling for sensitivity to religious freedom, Ivanka was back to posting cute pictures of her kids, this time featuring Joseph with his nose pressed against the glass.
Sunday, it was baby Theodore's turn in the spotlight, when his mom posted a super-static haired shot from a morning at her Washington, DC, home.
Blowing the lid off the hardscrabble attitude and language of the elder Trump was Ivanka's specialty throughout the presidential campaign, when her kind words about her father served to help people view him as real-person-Trump, not name-calling-candidate-Trump.
However, Ivanka's road to branding herself as approachable has hit a few hiccups, like the time she posted a photo of herself in a ball gown, ready for a night on the town, as chaos erupted at the nation's airports over her father's travel ban.
That misstep, which was criticized on social media, led to a week-long social media hiatus. Her next post was of daughter Arabella singing a song she learned for the Chinese New Year. After that, it was back to business, as she appeared at the end of the table while her father convened his Business Advisory Council.
One of the key items on the council's agenda, Ivanka Trump pointed out on Instagram, was "leveling the playing field for women in the workforce," another of the issues she focused on significantly during the campaign.

Japans immigration authority has told several Japanese language schools that students from China, Vietnam, Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka will meet stricter incoming inspection standards to avoid illegal stays. The policy will go into effect next month.
The students are now required to offer new financial evidence, such as detailed bank account information including copies of bankbooks.
There are many students from the five countries, and the number of illegal stays is increasing. We have heard of students illegally working in Japan, said a Justice Ministry official.According to reports, South Korean people make up the largest group in that demographic that has been staying in Japan illegally, with the number coming in at about 13,000 in 2015. That group is followed by those from the Chinese mainland (8,700), Thailand, Philippines and Vietnam.
Nepal, Myanmar and Sri Lanka were not on the top-ten list. Foreign students who would like to study in Japan need to study at a language school for half a year. After that, they can apply to a university, and then apply for a student visa. In Vietnam and Myanmar, it is very difficult to make students prepare new commercial certificates. The chaos in expanding, said an employee of a language school in Japan.
Japan started a G30 project in 2008 to attract foreign students to study at Japans universities, aiming to have 300,000 foreign students before 2020. The project resulted in an increase in the numbers of language schools in Japan. For example, in Kyushu, there were 64 Japanese language schools as of September last year, twice the number from ten years ago.

The Joe Biden example
For all her Foreign Policy misadventures the US has raised the bar of governance and responsible leadership that the World and those who seek to truly serve the people must learn from. Joe Biden had been in public office for 43 years. He was electedinto the Senate at 29. Served in the Senate for 35years and 8 years as Vice President yet he couldnt afford to pay for the expensive cancer treatment of his son who was the Attorney General of his State of Delaware. The son was a Iraq war veteran who served in the Army before he became Attorney General. Biden had to offer his house for sale to be able to pay for the medical care of his son, of course the son must have spent himself out before Biden, the father could come in to help pay the bill. Obama had to stop him from selling his house and offered to pay for the medical care from his own personal money.
Unfortunately the son died but not after the father had given all his best. Delaware is very close to Washington and Biden had come to Washington by train from Delaware everyday for work at the Capitol Hill and back home as a Senator. He will join the train back home on January 20th when he ends his tour of duty as the Vice President of United States. Delaware loves Biden for his years of service to the State and the people of United State. They call him the great son of Delaware. The point here is a man served for 35 years as a Senator and eight years as Vice President and no tonnes of money buried inside his compound and bank accounts.
How and where do politicians in US get their contentment that our own here cant go and find same. Leadership is about service. It is not a place to become billionaires and millionaires. For Biden, nothing but my admiration and respect.
A very good example of a great leader and it is fitting that Obama gave Joe Biden the public recognition he well earned and deserved.

JVP questions removal of Asoka Peiris
Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen yesterday said in Parliament that he would hold a proper inquiry over the charges made against Maithri Gunaratne, the newly appointed Competent Authority of Lanka Mineral Sands Limited.
The minister also distancing himself from the sudden removal of Asoka Peiris as the head of Lanka Mineral Sands Company appreciated his service and commitment to convert the institution to a profitable and successful venture.
Asoka Peiris was a senior and talented officer in the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS). He had done no wrong. He was also the Chairman of Delimitation Review Committee and performed his duties well, both positions he held simultaneously, he commented.
The minister made this comment in response to a question raised by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake over replacing Asoka Peiris with Maithri Gunaratne at Lanka Mineral Sands Limited. The minister replied that the new appointment had been made by the Secretary to the President and not by him.
MP Dissanayake, while observing that Maithri Gunaratne was removed from the Lanka Coal Company due to his implication in the controversial coal procurement tenders, questioned the rationale behind appointing him to the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited.
This has given the impression to the people that this Government only wants corrupt officials and that there is no chance for officials with integrity. Maithri Gunaratne recently made a site visit to Pulmudai by helicopter. Such is his wasteful expenses, Dissanayake alleged.
The minister replying to these concerns said he would get a clarification from Gunaratne in this regard and take necessary action. He also stressed that there is no plan to privatise the Lanka Mineral Sands, but added a private sector investment is being sought to hand over the management of the Company while retaining the ownership to the State.
MP Dissanayake also challenged the Government to point out a single wrong doing by Peiris when executing his duties.
Asoka Peiris who was appointed to the Lanka Mineral Sands Limited in 2015 worked hard to its betterment until his removal on February 7, 2017. The revenue of the institution which was Rs.285 million in 2015 increased to Rs.1,250 million in
2016. The balance of the companys bank account which was Rs 61 million in 2015 was Rs.385 million when he handed it over.
The Companys monthly expenditure which was Rs.100 million has been reduced to Rs 65 million. The bonus of the workers has been increased from Rs.17,000  Rs 43,000, Dissanayake explained.

Sri Lanka must go for more promotions to woo Japanese investors Sri Lanka must do more business promotions in Japan to woo Japanese investors, said Ambassador of Japan to Sri Lanka, Kenichi Suganuma.
Speaking at the National Chamber of Commerce (NCCSL) organised event he said that though some have heard about Sri Lanka and they still think Sri Lanka is a part of India.
The Ambassador said that Japanese investors specially in the SME sector was keen to invest outside Japan.If they are told about the huge potential of Sri Lanka they would be ready to invest,he said. Suganuma said that the Japanese people have more assets and money than the Japanese government. Japan also has a growing older generation and and they also have colossal sums of money. This elder segment likes to travel and stay in high end hotels. The Sri Lanka travel sectors must try to attract them to Sri Lanka,he said.
The ambassador said the Japanese business faces more challenges today due
to the cost factor. Most of the Japanese products are reproduced by Chinese at a lower cost and this is driving our competitiveness. So Japanese have to make products that can not be easily duplicated.
He said that the Sri Lankan government should also spell out long term investment policies that wont change regularly. (SS)

Love between wars
Since reading the voluminous novel The War and Peace by the celebrated Russian novelist Leo Tolstoy, I have a feeling that the title War novel is a defased usage for narratives woven around the subject of war. There are quite a number of human aspects linked to war and peace. From times immemorial, the poets and novelists have tried to dele on the subject not to create mere snapshots on warfare but to go several steps ahead in order to gauge the intensity of human degradation, disaster and agony that spring up in war-torn human settlements.
The novel titled as Half of a Yellow Sun by Chimamanda Ngozi Adiche is one such example written with a vast insights on Nigerian Biafra war of 1967  1970. As the writer states, while some of the experiences are drawn from her family background, where the war has brought about disaster, the rest comes as drawn from her research continuously held since devoting time to reading and observing the relevant sources.
Basically the shifting narration paves the way to gauge the nuances on which the pivotal experiences of the central theme of divided by war, united by love, rest. Though the narrative is seen from several points of view it is actually a novel without a novel type of narrative. There are insiders who experience the war as well as outsiders who come to know of the intensity of the war, both as natives and visitors of Biafra.
The outsiders manage to lead a day to day life in safety, while the insiders who face the disaster sacrifice their life to bombshells and fire. The creative writer in Adichi paves the way for the reader to see that the insiders are by and large in majority than the outsiders. For the outsiders, the war becomes a game.
Adichi states that she has war victims from her own family circles and from who she had had sensitive impact in the creation of several characters and situations. The research component that goes into the creative process of the work is significant. Adiche had managed to browse through almost all the African war sources from writers such as Chinua Achebe (Girls at war an other stories), Lechi Amahi (Sunset at Biafra), Cyprian Ekwansi (Divided we Stand), Fredrich Forsyth (Biafra Story) and Herbert Gold (Biafra Goodbye). The book within the pages of the visible work is titled as The World Was Silent When We Died never comes to light and written in fragments enabling the reader to gauge the two layers in one work.
The portrayal of Richard is seen as a wise man who tries to teach the ignorant people around him. He sees the vanity of human idiocy, power and vanity of storing more and more wealth. For him the love of people becomes the central vision that should be inculcated. As such he shows the learning of the ancestors as the wealth and war as the destructive force.
Richard who looks at the world situation as an existentialist sees the war as an ugly factor. His vision is that the man is not civilised enough to know the beauty of existence. He denounces the colonial rule and the advent of two foreign war correspondents to report the war-torn situation. At times he becomes silent in the face of such correspondents declaring his stance.
The other three characters in the cluster of 10 to 15 that emerge are namely Olanna, Kainene and Susan. They have a particular role to play in contrast to Richard., whose interests are broad and visionary. The situation that get created by them throw light to the central intention of Adichi, in the formation of war and love.
Adichi visualises how the impact of Nigeria  Biafra war has become a political issue. It is the inner layer of the situations which emerge not only as a dispute that arises from two lands, but also as a racial and ethnic struggle of two communities as kindled by extraneous power structures who could be discerned as forces of exploitation. The narrative is well constructed exhibiting some of the mythological and legendary elements common to African regions.

Low priority to harvest, ship Pulmoddai mineral sands now - EP Governor
The shipping of processed mineral sands from Pulmoddai has low priority now leaving possibilities for untoward business deals, and losing valuable foreign earnings, Eastern Province Governor Austin Fernando said.
He made these views speaking at the first round of Trincomalee Consultation, held in Colombo, organized by the Pathfinder Association.
He also noted that, in Trincomalee, the port area development had been appallingly slow.The road for investments is wide open and fresh interventions are required for Trincomalee, which has been identified by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who has initiated action to develop same.
Trincomalee has one of the largest natural harbours in the world that has vast development potential.Since the handing over by the British in 1957, it is underutilised. It needs modernising as destabilization in the East due to terrorism prevented modernization.
It is now limited to wheat milling, cement production, petroleum product development, minor fishery development and tourist service delivery. There is expectation of joint development of balance oil tank farm with Indians, which if executed may make a visible impact in the Trincomalee business environment.
According to the governor, any exercise to make Trincomalee the Hub of the Indian Ocean will not cease with maritime activity, but also bring prosperity to the hinterland.
The governor further added the investors can commit with confidence due to the stable law and order status and the enthusiasm of the government for regional development. The law and order organizations have brought overall normalcy.

The magnificent Canon in D.
Seldom played in concert halls or at command performances; not a favourite for orchestration nor the top choices for leading conductors around the world but Canon In D from the day it debuted had survived the music scene no matter the onslaught it had earned. Such an enchanting and romantic soul-clinging score left undone. Where he did go wrong I cannot find the answer for that for someone who even taught music and the violin for the second generation of Bachs, one of whose father happened to be the sensational Johanne Sebastian Bach.
Yet, the score remain stubbornly ahead of the extraordinary works of such from Europe and Russia. Gets annual rating from among the greats and remains so. The Annual selection of the of the 100 top most favourite composers for their works conducted by the Classic FM LISTENERS HALL FAME has CONON IN D in 13th or 14th spot most of the years because of this magnificent score ahead of such The Messiah, Requiem, The Four Seasons, St Mathews Passion. Ave Verum Corpus, The Blue Denub etc. few that crossed my mind. He has even pushed Mozart to the 100th spot on Ave Verum Corpus.
I too discovered CANON IN D long after I quiet music studies. My favourite conductor, Vladimir Jurowski of the London Philharmonic Orchestra I never miss seeing if ever I am in London during the seasons who unlike others unearth the less - played, less - popular scores for the benefit of all music Lovers, missed the CANON IN D or perhaps played when I was not at one of his nights.
Developed from sonata, the emphasis were almost equal to the Canzoni cantatas that began in Italy around the seventeenth century. Pachelbel fell in line with this concept for this heavenly score. Yet it lacked the technical brilliance of Bach s music but the expressive fire was there. Pachelbel stored his most beautiful and deepest thoughts for this composition and it was easy because music written in Baroque period had all the essence of light romance. The extraordinary fact about Pachelbel is that he never went out of Germany either to study or perform, perhaps a reason for hie low - key profile. His claim for fame during his lifetime was as an organist and composer. Wrote dozens of corales for the organ and ninety five fugues as interludes to the MAGNIFICAT along with non - liturgical toccaras, preludes, key - board music and similar numbers. The list of his motets is a long one. More importantly, Pachelbel pioneered his musical symbolism by using such ways in his sacred music as repeated notes to illustrate.
a) steadfastness in minor keys for sorrowful moods
b) joy in major keys
c) evil in broken diminished seventh chord.
He set the first part of the CANON and Gigue in D for three violins and basso. It took the form of variations ovens the repeated short bass phrase of the in production.
Johann Pachelbel was born in 1653 in Nuremberg into a middle-class family, son of Johann (Hans) Pachelbel (born 1613 in Wunsiedel, Germany), a wine dealer, and his second wife Anna (Anne) Maria Mair. The exact date of Johanns birth is unknown, but since he was baptized on September 1, he may have been born in late August.
During his early youth, Pachelbel received musical training from Heinrich Schwemmer, a musician and music teacher who later became the cantor of St. Sebaldus Church (Sebalduskirche). Some sources indicate that Pachelbel also studied with Georg Caspar Wecker, organist of the same church and an important composer of the Nuremberg school, but this is now considered unlikely. In any case, both Wecker and Schwemmer were trained by Johann Erasmus Kindermann, one of the founders of the Nuremberg musical tradition, who had been at one time a pupil of Johann Staden.
In June 1678, Pachelbel was employed as organist of the Predigerkirche in Erfurt, succeeding Johann Effler (c. 16401711; Effler later preceded Johann Sebastian Bach in Weimar). The Bach family was very well known in Erfurt (where virtually all organists would later be called Bachs), so Pachelbels friendship with them continued here. Pachelbel became godfather to Johann Ambrosius daughter, Johanna Juditha, taught Johann Christoph Bach (16711721), Johann Sebastians eldest brother, and lived in Johann Christian Bachs (16401682) house. Pachelbel remained in Erfurt for 12 years and established his reputation as one of the leading German organ composers of the time during his stay. The chorale prelude became one of his most characteristic products of the Erfurt period, since Pachelbels contract specifically required him to compose the preludes for church services. His duties also included organ maintenance and, more importantly, composing a large-scale work every year to demonstrate his progress as composer and organist, as every work of that kind had to be better than the one composed the year before.
Although Pachelbel was an outstandingly successful organist, composer, and teacher at Erfurt, he asked permission to leave, apparently seeking a better appointment, and was formally released on 15 August 1690, bearing a testimonial praising his diligence and fidelity.
He was employed in less than a fortnight: from 1 September 1690, he was a musician-organist in the Wrttemberg court at Stuttgart under the patronage of Duchess Magdalena Sibylla. That job was better, but, unfortunately, he lived there only two years before fleeing the French attacks of the War of the Grand Alliance. His next job was in Gotha as the town organist, a post he occupied for two years, starting on 8 November 1692; there he published his first, and only, liturgical music collection.
When former pupil Johann Christoph Bach married in October 1694, the Bach family celebrated the marriage on 23 October 1694 in Ohrdruf, and invited him and other composers to provide the music; he probably attended  if so, it was the only time J.S. Bach, then nine years old, met Johann Pachelbel.
In his three years in Gotha, he was twice offered positions, in Stuttgart and at Oxford University; he declined both. Meanwhile, in Nuremberg, when the St. Sebaldus Church organist Georg Caspar Wecker (and his possible former teacher) died on 20 April 1695, the city authorities were so anxious to appoint Pachelbel (then a famous Nuremberger) to the position that they officially invited him to assume it without holding the usual job examination or inviting applications from prominent organists from lesser churches. He accepted, was released from Gotha in 1695, and arrived in Nuremberg in summer, with the city council paying his per diem expenses.
Pachelbel who was not a confirmed Christian though he wrote many sacred works, used to visit quaint ancient church on a mountain top in the windy outskirts of Nuremburg with many worshippers who came for mass from different directions to listen to their German Chief Priest who spoke no English. Tall with a magnetic personality that drew worshippers to him and among them Maria, organist who led the hymns.
On many occasions Pachelbel noticed her adoration for him and his resonant voice as she played. Maria was attracted to him. She always played a prelude and prepared the way for a longer work beginning on any note that related between others. Its tonality was smoothing and delicately beautiful as Pachebel listened. After running her fingers through keyboard, she would suddenly stop to gaze towards the alter. This was a regular happening, the gentle music falling on his ears. Maria would wait until the High Priest left. He had stolen her heart. She was sad.
THE DREAM One night, Pachelbel awoke from his dream. He heard her play the opening notes of his score, In his sleep, he put down the notes. he played while dreaming with Marias Canon. At dawn he visualized the concept that was going to be his CANON IN D Major.
Few Sundays later, he handed Maria the full score of Canon in D Major to be played at the end of the Mass before the congregation left. The elated Maria obliged and not one single parishioner moved until the last chord was played. As Pachelbal turned to leave the church, he saw the High Priest approach Maria who was still on the keyboard.
The glow on their faces revealed the romance of CANON IN D.

Malayali family brings back to life a slice of colonial Colombo

The Vethodys, a family of Malayali entrepreneurs with roots in Kerala and Sri Lanka, have brought back to life a slice of Colombos colonial past with the re-launch of their extensively renovated 135 year old iconic Hotel Nippon situated in the heart of the capitals business district.
Nippon as it is popularly known, occupies Manning Mansions in Slave Island, a place which the 16 th. Century Portuguese rulers of Colombo had used to house slaves brought from Africa. Being one of the oldest buildings in Colombo, Manning Mansions were designated as one of its heritage buildings by the Sri Lankan Department of Archeology with strict rules for their upkeep.
Hotel Nippon found its place in cinematic history when it was featured in David Leans Academy Award winning filmBridge On The River Kwaishot in Ceylon in the mid 1950s. According to Dr.Valsan Vethody, a Director of the hotel, some of the indoor shots of the Japanese army headquarters were shot in Nippon, and its then joint proprietor, Greg Roskowski, a Polish migr, had acted in the film as one of the British Prisoners of War.
Built in 1882, Manning Mansions initially comprised 14 apartments to house British military officers. But sometime in the 20 th.Century, Roskowski senior bought it and turned it into a hotel which was popular with sailors. For a short while Roskowski ran it as Hotel Polski but renamed it as Hotel Nippon when he married a Japanese lady. The Japanese connection got strengthened in the mid 1950s, when Roskowskis son Greg, an announcer in the then hugely popular English service of Radio Ceylon, also took a Japanese bride. Serving authentic Japanese food along with continental and local fare, Nippon became a must for Japanese visitors to Colombo.
Meanwhile, Roskowski juniors Japanese wife took as her business associate, Vethody Kumaran, a Ceylonese of Kerala origin, who, after leaving the engineering corps of the British army, was running a restaurant at Pettah.
But it did not take Kumaran long to assume full ownership of the hotel. Under Kumaran, Nippon retained its place as one of the three modern hotels within Colombo city, the others being Galle Face Hotel and the Grand Oriental Hotel. Nippon is thus an indelible landmark in the hospitality history of Colombo.
But the good times came to an abrupt end in 1983 when ethnic riots convulsed Colombo.
From 1983 to till the end of the war in 2009, it was a dark age for the hotel, recalled Vishnu K.Vethody, the young Managing Director of the hotel and a grandson of Vethody Kumaran. Nippon was particularly hard hit because it was located in a life-threatening zone housing the headquarters of the Sri Lankan Army and Air Force  institutions which were under constant threat from terrorists. In fact, on January 2, 2008, a bomb targeting an army bus went off right outside the hotel killing four.
But once the war ended in May 2009, the Vethody clan sprang to life. Encouraged by the Urban Development Authoritys ambitious plan for the restoration of heritage buildings in Colombo, the Vethody brothers Valsan, Vasan, Chandrasena and the later Prasannan, launched an ambitious LKR 400 million (US$ 2 million) project to completely renovate the rooms and the building, while keeping intact the basic design, the trade mark faade, and the sturdy staircases made of 130 year old Burma teak.
The fixtures in the hotel, including the linen used in the rooms, are imported and on par with other top hotels in Colombo, Vishnu points out.
With Indians being the single largest group among tourist arrivals in Sri Lanka, Nippon caters to the Indian palate too. It is the only hotel to serve the famous Madras filter coffee. And being Keralites, the Vethodys have seen to it that the hotel serves a range of authentic Malayali dishes, done by two chefs from Kerala. If one is craving for authentic Calicut dum biryani in Colombo, head for Nippon. General Manager Amitha Manchanaike sitting at the helm, ensures that the administrative machinery is well oiled and up and running round the clock.
And the tariff is competitive, points out Vishnu.
One does not have to have a deep pocket to book into Nippon as the charge per day for bed and breakfast is just US$ 60, with all taxes included. Given the low tariff people come with low expectations, planning to stay for a day. But seeing the good conditions, many end up extending their stay by three or four days, he said.
Bringing back memories
The renovated Nippon is meant to revive pleasant memories of the Colombo of the fifties and sixties when it was a swinging city with a distinctly Westernized air. Located not far from the sea front, the Beira Lake and cinema theaters, Nippon was a favorite rendezvous for young couples up to the late 1970s.
It was common for young people to see an English movie at theRioand walk across to Nippon to have milkshakes or ice creams before heading home. I have come across couples in their sixties and seventies dropping in only to go back to their romantic past. An elderly lady got teary eyed recalling how her beau proposed to her sitting right here, Vishnu said.
Situated in a commercial area, Nippon has been a busy eatery during the day, famous for its short eats especially mutton rolls.
Our rolls makers have been passing their skill down generations. This is the secret of the uniqueness of Nippons rolls, Vishnu said.
Emotional Bond
The personal attention that Nippons staff gave to its customers had created an emotional bond between the two.
Personal service has been one of Nippons strong points right through. And we will to maintain it, Vishnu pledged.
Here in Nippon, the proprietors set the example. With airs whatsoever, they make it a point to address all staff members by their first names and move around the premises chit chatting with them. The Vethodys often go on excursions with the hotel staff to infuse informality in relations.

Merit based selection brings rich rewards
The two T20 internationals that Sri Lanka won against Australia at Victoria that has given them the 3-match series with one match to play amply demonstrates what a difference it makes to a team when players in form at any given time are selected. When the selections are done on merit it is the entire country that celebrates as opposed to 4 or 5 people benefiting personally when selections are manipulated.
Manipulation of selections was rampant during the South African series and this was highlighted in these columns especially the middle order batting which was constantly failing and letting the side down. Sri Lanka suffered immensely by it being whitewashed in the Tests (3-0) and the One-Day Internationals (5-0). They saved face by winning the T20I series 2-1.
In the current T20I series in Australia one could see the fortunes of the team with the changes made to the middle order.
Asela Gunaratne has played the role of hero in both Sri Lankas victories with some sterling batting performances out of the top drawer.
Gunaratne was not even considered for the Sri Lanka A team squad in spite of several consistent performances in the Premier Division over many seasons until he was 29 years old. He was first included as a wild card in the unofficial test squad against the visiting Pakistan A team by the selection committee headed by Kapila Wijegunawardene. He thereafter toured New Zealand with the SL A side and subsequently was rewarded with a slot in the T20 squad to India for his performances in the domestic Premier T20 tournament where he helped Army Sports Club emerge champions. This was just before the Asia Cup and World T20 and he made his T20I debut in India. Unfortunately for Gunaratne his international appearance coincided with the time that the corrupt administrators were hell bent on scuttling the planning for the World T20 to meet their own agenda's where they refused to send a selector on tour to achieve their own sinister ends.
But as luck would have it Gunaratne got his break with a tour to Zimbabwe where he made his maiden Test hundred. The tour to South Africa followed and in the fifth and final match he scored his maiden ODI century. He has continued this form in Australia with two peach of an innings under pressure that has stamped his ability, class and temperament to bring out his best when the chips are down.
To the present T20 side that has won the series in Australia if one is to add players in the calibre of Kusal Perera, Jeffrey Vandersay, Dushmantha Chameera, Thisara Perera and Kasun Rajitha to make up the ODI and T20 squads what a formidable side Sri Lanka will have. The depth in talent we possess is phenomenal only if they are managed and nurtured by the right administrators.
Sri Lanka may have won the T20I series Down Under under the captaincy of Upul Tharanga but it was blatantly clear that Lasith Malinga was running the show from behind the scene. It was injury that sidelined Malinga from the T20 captaincy and it would be the right decision to bring him back as captain and reduce the workload on Angelo Mathews.
The question that needs to be asked is can Tharanga justify a place in the T20 format He looked out of his depth while fielding and batting. Just imagine what a formidable opening pair Sri Lanka would have if Kusal Perera replaces him with Niroshan Dickwella.
One also has to question the One captain policy advocated by the current administration without any comprehension on how the game has evolved over the years which has placed a greater workload on Angelo Mathews and his deputy Dinesh Chandimal.
Prior to their appointments Mathews not burdened with the T20I captaincy aggregated 1105 runs in Tests and ODIs in 2015. Chandimal slotted in at No 4 in the batting without the burden of keeping wickets and the vice-captaincy in order to give him the freedom to concentrate on his batting and consolidate his position, aggregated 1129 runs in Tests and ODI's the same period.
What we see today is how their individual performances have suffered to the point where Chandimal's place in the side is in jeopardy and Mathews is having a constant run with injuries.
Managing players workload carefully is of paramount importance given the busy schedules that they have to contend with in the current cricket calendars. Equally important is of protecting the integrity and independence of the selection process from corrupt administrators.
Sri Lanka needs to address these two key issues if they are move to forward and be a potent force in world cricket which they once were.

Migration causing Sri Lanka many health challenges
Sri Lanka faces many health challenges due to migration and could continue to do so. The experiences and understanding gained over the past years have helped to develop an all inclusive Migration Health Policy, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said. Addressing the inauguration of the second Global Consultation on Migrant Health : Resetting the agenda, held at the Galadari Hotel in Colombo yesterday, he said the National Migration Health Policy was launched in Sri Lanka in 2013 during President Maithripala Sirisenas tenure as the Health Minister. According to Senaratne, Sri Lanka included key health components in the National Migration Health Policy such as inbound migration, outbound migration, families left behind and internal migration.
He said at the 106th IOM Council in November 2015, that a High-level Panel on Migration, Human Mobility and Global Health was organised.
During the Session, President Maithripala Sirisena, offered to host a Global Consultation on migrant health and it is currently taking place in Sri Lanka. Health Ministry Secretary Anura Jayawickrama and several others spoke. Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara and many others were present at the occasion.

Music, his first love
Like Mozart's Requiem, the Sri Lankan listening audience is yet to be trained to respond to guitar music. It is of course the de facto earnest emotion that matters when listening attentively to guitar music. The guitar music can be on the other hand kaleidoscopic conveyors of emotion. Witness Rukshan Pereras blend of untrammelled skill as he switches between guitar and piano with easy dexterity.
Q: Your mother was Trila Perera, a music teacher at Princess of Wales College in 1960s and 1970s. How did your mother influence your career
A: My mother was a pianist, conductor, church organist and community leader. I always think of her when I compose and perform. I thank my mother for giving me the first lesson at the piano. With music of the Beatles, Shadows and Santana where music was heavy on guitar, I quickly switched to guitar. I taught it myself.
Q: How is it possible to self-teach an instrument
A: We had no choice those days. There were no music schools. No guitar teachers. No books. Not even youtube or videos to watch and learn. All we had was radio. We listened to radio and took the portions, chords and lyrics as the song was played. Thats how we learnt. Our children find this hard to believe!
Q: Like any other artiste, you had to put art aside for higher studies. How did you strike a balance
A: I entered a University in New York and obtained a Bachelors degree in Systems Development and continued with an MBA. While in the university I joined the College Jazz Band as guitarist and vocalist. I learnt the basics of jazz improvisation. After graduating I worked for Philip Morris International for over 20 years in the IT field and retired early to return to Sri Lanka to once again to continue music. This time with a difference!
Q: Despite credentials, why didnt you join the corporate sector
A: Working for Philip Morris for 20 years gave me the opportunity to use my analytical skills while travelling the world and managing employees. But I retired early to get back to my first love  music and I am very happy with the decision.
Q: Most of your compositions have an inclination towards social issues. Any particular reason
A: I write songs to promote awareness on important social issues and raise funds for deserving charities. Most of my songs are in English and have touched the important topics of the day related to Sri Lanka and the world. Environment, child abuse, peace and unity, freedom, helping children, drug abuse, education, poverty alleviation, religious and racial harmony, helping victims of natural disasters, fighting cancer, helping disabled persons and fighting leprosy for example. Some songs have been written to specific organizations. I have managed to raise millions for charities through my concerts, my DVDs and other events. I must also thank all the musicians/singers and others who have joined me to support on such endeavors.
Q: However, we hardly hear them on local radio.
A: When I initially launched my CD titled Coming Home To You, I tried to promote it through radio, but got disappointed with lack of support for English originals in Sri Lanka. Therefore now when I compose a song, I record it, add appropriate video clips and post it on Youtube. I have only uploaded about 30 songs but I have 400 subscribers on my youtube channel who enjoy my music and already have about 400,000 hits on my songs. I believe I have more fans outside of Sri Lanka than in Sri Lanka! However, I will make another attempt with the radio stations.
Q: You are also skilled in whistling, scatting and composing acapellas.
A: I can whistle a melody and the harmony simultaneously. This is achieved with a subtle movement of the tongue which is hard to explain. Some musicians are very interested in analyzing this skill. Scatting is improvising using the vocal cords. You can also synchronize the guitar improvisation with the vocals, a skill introduced by my hero George Benson. I sometimes try scatting the harmony note of the note I am improvising on the guitar which is somewhat challenging to do spontaneously!
Q: What are your current projects
A: I launched my third DVD recently at the Curve. The DVD is this years live concert and it comprises of the variety I talked about and some fun and entertainment songs as well. A good gift for a music lover! Its available at Torana, Barefoot, Yamaha and Fasion Optic (Flower Road).
Q: Despite all your talents, you seem to lack national recognition. Why
A: When I compose or perform, I do it because I enjoy, believe in the cause I am writing for and love to share my music with my fans, but never think of trophies, certificates or recognition. But if I may mention, a professor living in Canada who happens to be one of my fans and who has managed to watch a few of my concerts on his holiday in Sri Lanka has written to President to recognise my talents as a composer, for promoting the awareness on important social issues in Sri Lanka and for my contribution towards deserving charities. I was in shock when I recently received a copy of that letter in the mail. But I dont think it is going anywhere!
Q: What are your future plans
A: My seventh concert Rukshan Perera Live In Concert VII with original music will be staged on March 5 at Bishops Auditorium. I still need to complete my Jazz CD as well as a Christmas CD.
Q: What is jazz
A: Basically, jazz allows a musician to spontaneously improvise and express a song with a solo on an instrument or voice. It can be just a basic variation of the melody to an ultra-difficult solo combining various scales and complicated rhythmic structures yet staying on the basic properties of the song. Today one can do a PhD in jazz theory and improvisation.
Q: What is your advice for up and coming musicians
A: I have seen very talented youngsters. They sing well and play their instruments well. One thing we missed out when growing up in the 70s was not having music schools, teachers and other books or videos to learn from.
Today, there are good music schools, many teachers, many books and videos, and most importantly youtube where you can practically learn anything you want. Do a little research on the web in your instrument and make it as perfect as you can. Also, I hope more and more youngsters will get into doing originals instead of only performing cover songs.
We lack English originals big time in Sri Lanka and that should change instead of only following cover songs.

New retreading section inaugurated saving millions on Army vehicles
The modern state-of-the-art retreading section in the recently-established Ordnance Factory of the Army at Dombagoda, Horana was inaugurated yesterday by Army Commander Lieutenant General Crishanthe De Silva.
The new tyre retreading section built at a cost of Rs. 14 million is capable of retreading 8,804 vehicle tyres of the Army annually, saving the army Rs. 20.5 million annually. The new section has the capacity to retread 36 tyres daily.The opening of the retreading section in the Ordnance Factory signals a new turning point in the Armys modernizing and restructuring of its infrastructure facilities, on par with fast changing, innovative prospects and challenging dimensions at global levels. The new section is manned by six officers and 300 other rankers and commanded by Brigadier H.L Guruge, Factory Commandant. After inaugurating the retreading section, the Commander inspected other areas of potential products, in the pipeline, such as new initiatives of shoe production, manufacture of ladies hand bags, embroidery production technique for badges, and manufacture of berets flags, etc, still on experimental basis in separate sections inside the Ordnance Factory complex.
The Commander also inspected a display of several factory-manufactured and technically-modified accessories, needed by the Army for regular use. He also inquired into several aspects of production processes of such items while viewing them and encouraged those in charge of those sections to do their best for the organisation since the Army is always ready to help such moves.
The Commander unveiled a symbolic plaque formally opening the new section.
Both the Army Ordnance Factory at Dombagoda and the mega Army Industrial Workshop at Kosgama commenced operations in September 2014 with the objective of producing varieties of hardware, barrack equipment, machinery tools and l other accessories, required for the Army.
The Commander through these projects expects to develop and promote Army skills, innovative creativity, knowledge on modern technology, access to quality products, and provide second career options for hundreds of soldiers through craftsmanship, etc upon their retirement. The project would also save foreign exchange and local costs for the organisation while supplying critical needs of the Army on priority basis. The initial capital Rs 14 million for the project had been allocated by the Master General Ordnance (MGO) branch of the Army through the Directorate of Ordnance Services (DOS) and another Rs 1.4 million had been allocated to purchase raw materials, required for the project.

New trial date fixed for Sri Lankan smuggler in B.C.

A new trial date has been set for a Sri Lankan man accused of smuggling hundreds of Tamil migrants to Canada aboard a decrepit cargo ship.
Kunarobinson Christhurajah will face trial again in B.C. Supreme Court starting in May, three months after a jury failed to reach a verdict in his case.
He was charged alongside another Sri Lankan and two Canadians of masterminding the voyage of the MV Sun Sea, which carried 492 asylum seekers to British Columbias coast in the summer of 2010.
The jury acquitted the three other men, but couldnt reach a decision on Christhurajahs case.
He is accused of owning the ship that brought the migrants from Thailand to British Columbia.
At trial, the court heard that he was an asylum seeker who travelled on the Sun Sea with his wife and other several other members of his family.
Christhurajah was granted bail last month after spending more than six years in jail.

Noyahr attack should be probed deep
The Government should leave no stone unturned in getting to the bottom of the brutal attack on journalist Keith Noyahr, not only to do justice to the scribe, but also to ensure the protection and security of members of the fourth estate in the future. All regimes have been responsible for attacks on journalists but this reached new heights under the Rajapaksa dispensation where impunity reigned.
This was a time when the war raged and hence provided a perfect screen for those in power to attack or eliminate those not to their liking. This was the situation even during the second JVP uprising in the late eighties where scores were settled by various parties under cover of the brutalized environment. But the separatist war gave the powers that be a readymade cover for their acts by terming those who did not toe their as traitors, knowing this would be acceptable to the public. One recalls former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, during an interview, when asked about the Lasantha murder, saying; Who is Lasantha. He is only one man. There are thousands dying today on the battlefield. Such was the glibness in which that killing was treated, giving the act legitimacy.
Noyahr was just one journalist who was targeted during that era but lived to tell the tale or part of the tale. It is hoped he would come out with more and explicit details of the incident leading to the identity of all those who acted behind the scenes. Noyahr was abducted in May 2008, unlawfully detained, tortured, and released after pressure was brought to bear by influential circles in the media. He subsequently fled to Australia with his family, worse for the experience and maintained a lengthy silence on the matter. With the advent of the new government and investigations launched into all past attacks on journalists, Noyahr too would have felt the time was ripe to talk. It is not known if he was asked on the particularly the line of questioning he was subjected to. This, no doubt, would have provided the necessary information to the CID to form its own idea as to the masterminds behind the attack.
Noyahr, at the time of the incident wrote a Defence column for the Nation publication where he was Deputy Editor and certain material in it obviously had riled elements in the political and military establishment. The fact that the arrested military Intelligence officers formed part of a unit that carried out attacks on journalists, itself, is revealing. The CID should be commended for unearthing this military safe house from where these hit men operated that has now opened a trail leading to the hidden hand.
As argued in certain quarters, these military officers, on their own, had no reason to harm Noyahr and were obviously acting on orders from higher ups in the military, who were doing the bidding of certain VVIPs at the time. The abduction of Noyahr and the killing of Lasantha could not have been carried out so brazenly in the open at a time when the city was crawling with military personnel.
Now that a genuine effort is being made to ferret out those behind the attack on Noyahr, similar attacks that were carried out on lesser known scribes too should be investigated with the same thoroughness. The attacks on the Udayan press and the murder of Tamil journalists in the North should also gone into. This is because it was said that a certain pro government Tamil group, at the time, which assisted the military were behind such attacks and killings. There is also no probe on the arson attack on the Sirasa studios a day before the Lasantha murder. All such attacks were carried out to silence those media houses that were critical of the government.
The involvement of military personnel in attacks on journalists and other criminal acts, no doubt, has cast a pall on the entire military establishment. These elements have not only brought dishonour and disgrace to the military as a whole but have also let down their colleagues who made immense sacrifices to rid the country of the terrorist menace. The Joint Opposition which perennially blames the government for hounding war heroes, ranaviruwo has gone strangely silent following the latest arrests. Perhaps, realization has dawned on the leading lights of the JO that some war heroes, at least, are not what they are really painted out to be.
The government has done right in not trying to intervene in the arrest of the military personnel in the Noyahr case as with the Lasantha killing and the Ekneligoda disappearance, ignoring popular cries. There can be no one set of laws for war heroes and another for the ordinary man. Besides, treating military personnel differently, just because they fought in the war, will be a travesty of justice and a license to all war heroes to go on the rampage. No hue and cry was made by the pseudo patriots of the JO when Sarath Fonseka was thrown in the slammer.

Parking gets  easier with Tenaga  ParkSmart App
As the population of Colombo increases daily, the congestion on the roads is on a rise. With this, there is a lingering need for an effective vehicle parking management system. Tenaga Car Parks, the pioneer in providing parking and traffic management solutions in Sri Lanka presents to you the ultimate solution with the launch of their new user friendly and convenient mobile app Tenaga ParkSmart.
The mobile application was launched in partnership with the Colombo Municipal Council todayin the presence of Eng.L R L Wickramaratne Deputy Municipal Commissioner (Engineering Services) amongst other distinguished guests from the Colombo Municipal Council and the Sri Lanka Police.
Headed by Nihal Wickramaratne, Director Engineering Traffic Design and Road Safety and his team at the Colombo Municipal Council, ParkSmart is the first ever mobile application in Sri Lanka designed to facilitate efficient parking.
The designated areas where the Smart Park Machines have been placed are Galle Road (from Dehiwala to Galadari junction, including all connecting by-lanes) and R A De Mel Mawatha (from Dharmarama Road to Liberty Plaza Junction and all connecting by-lanes).
At the event, the CEO of Tenaga Car Parks (Pvt) Ltd, Dilan Perera enlightened those present about the Tenaga ParkSmart application. The solar powered parking machinespartnered with Dialog Axiata and powered by CALE Sweden have been in place at these locations from the beginning of last year. The parking tariff is calculated on an hourly basis and differs according to the vehicle type.
The mobile application developed by Negete (Pvt) Ltd, only available for Android devices at the time of the launch, will come into play as a tool to consume time and avoid the unnecessary hustle of personally going to the metre machines. This app provides the facility for payments to be paid using eZ cash, Dialog Add2Bill (in the near future) or through your debit or credit card. It comes with special features to make life much easier by having an automatic reminder that will notify you when your parking time is about to expire, a parking tracker and a record of all your parking history.
Representatives from Negete demonstrated to the gathering exactly how the app would function. Once downloaded, the application requires you to register your phone number as this is how the phone would be connected to the app.
Tenaga Park Smart will soon be available on other operating systems and is also expected to be joined by Gtechna, Canada to establish a proper system of enforcement.

Relief for drought affected farmers: Anura Yapa
Reliefs will be provided for farmer families affected by the drought from March, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarashana Yapa said in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday in response to a query by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena under standing order 23(2).
The minister said there is no need to declare an emergency situation as there is only a natural disaster. He said the government has taken measures to make an assessment on the damages caused by the drought. He said two census are under way to assess the crisis situation.
Compensation will be paid to farmers after an assessment is over on the affected crops. About 281,562 families have been affected by the drought, Minister Yapa said.
He said affected families will be granted financial assistance and food. They will be provided jobs in development projects in their areas until they could resume to their cultivations.
The minister said the Cultivation Insurance Board will grant Rs. 10,000 for an acre of the affected cultivations. The minister said the government has sought foreign relief and is awaiting for the response.
Joint Opposition member Gunawardene raising the question said people in several districts, including Anuradhapura, Trincomalle, Moneragala, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Badulla, Kantale and Kegalle have been affected by the drought. He said the government had failed to declare an emergency situation and to provide relief to the people.
The affected people told me that they have received no relief yet, MP Gunawardena said.
Malik sees importance of diversifying export basket
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema yesterday in Parliament reiterated the importance of diversifying the countrys export basket and reaching out to new markets to improve export income.
The minister was participating in the debate over several Regulations under the Imports and Exports (Control) Act, Order under the Sri Lanka Export Development Act and three Orders under the Strategic Development Project Act.
It is necessary to diversify the export market. We have been exporting to our traditional markets such as the US and European Union. The time has come to look at new markets. We are in the process of negotiating bilateral trade agreements with countries such as China, Singapore, Japan and Korea and entering into strategic partnerships with Thailand. We are looking at invigorating our FTA with Pakistan and Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India. This is the only way forward for our country, he said.
Giving an overview of Sri Lankas exports and growth, the minister said Sri Lankas exports have diversified little over the last 20 years. While other countries are gaining significant growth from new exports, over 90 percent of Sri Lankas exports focused on traditional exports such as garments, tea, precious stones, rubber and other agricultural goods.
Meanwhile, Thailand which once had a similar export basket to Sri Lanka, continued to diversify into electronics in 1990s and transportation and chemical products since then. Vietnam which had similar export basket to Sri Lanka in 1995 has diversified rapidly over the last 10 years. Sri Lanka remains stuck exporting products mainly apparel and agricultural products, he said.
Sri Lankas annualised GDP growth from 1990 to 2014 was around 5.4 percent. The country has little GDP growth coming from exports compared to several South East and East Asian countries. The export component of growth in Sri Lanka is generally weakened over time. The lack of export growth contributes to pressures in Sri Lankas balance of payments which constrained overall economic growth potential. Sri Lankas trade deficit ranging from six to 14 percent of the GDP since 1990 drives a persistent current account deficit which has not been matched by capital inflows. Sri Lanka depended on international reserves in 2015 to fill the gap in its balance of payments which led to elevated levels of macroeconomic risks and increased borrowing costs for the government until the International Monetary Fund (IMF) support agreement was signed in April 2016, Minister Samarawickrema said.
He said several major export industries in Sri Lanka are forced to keep wages low to maintain international competitive prices. They struggle to find workers and retain them as incomes increase in the country. Wages paid by exporting industries are lower than most non-tradable industries such as construction, transport and public administration work, he said.
House puts off passing of two Orders
Parliament yesterday put off passing of two Orders under the Strategic Development Projects Act, which were intended to grant tax exemptions to the International Financial City (Port City Project) in Colombo and a Mixed Development Project in eight acres in Slave Island.
Strategic Development and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrema moved these Orders for debate, but did not put them before the House at the end of the debate.
The Orders were to grant significant tax concessions to the two projects. Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake during the debate objected to passing of those Orders, stating that Parliament was unaware of the nature of the projects.
The MP, pointing out the Company undertaking the Port City Project has been exempted from income tax for 32 and half years, registered his strong opposition to the move. He also criticised waiving of PAYE tax for those involved in the projects.
Minister Samarawickrema, agreeing to table the revised Colombo Port City Project Agreement in Parliament, however, clarified that the Orders were presented to the House as of the two Agreements the previous government had signed with the respective companies in 2014.
We have not given any new concession. These concessions were agreed by the previous government. We cannot take them back now. The port city project is an investment of USD 1.4 billion. It is normal to give concessions to such an investment, he said.
North against Sustainable Development Bill: Speaker
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said in Parliament that the Northern Provincial Council (NPC) has informed Parliament that it did not agree with the proposed Sustainable Development Bill, while the North Central Provincial Council has expressed its consent.
He said the Eastern Provincial Council has decided to postpone the consideration of the Bill until constitutional reforms are implemented.
The Bill was was presented in Parliament and debated in Parliament on January 9 and was directed to each Provincial Council for their views to be expressed within a month from January 10.
The announcement went on to say that the Central, North Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Western and Uva Provincial Councils have given consent to the Bill subjected to amendments.
The Speaker also observed that the views of the provincial councils will be referred to National Policies and Economic Affairs.
Wimal can participate in committee meetings only on Parliament days
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said in Parliament yesterday that Joint Opposition MP Wimal Weerawansa who is in jail will be allowed to participate in the committee meetings only during Parliament days. He made this observation when MP Weerawansa questioned whether he was allowed to participate in the meetings of committees.
MP Weerawansa said he should be allowed to participate in the committee meetings, such as the committee on Public Accounts (PAC) and Sectoral Oversight committees, even on the days when there are no Parliament sessions, because it was his right as a Parliamentarian.
Compensation for kith and kin of Beruwela boat mishap victims
The government will grant compensation of Rs. 100,000 to the family members of those who died at the accident of the capsized boat in Beruwela, Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa said in Parliament yesterday. The minister said the Cabinet also decided to grant Rs. 20,000 for those who were hospitalised.
He made these observations yesterday in response to a query by Joint Opposition member MP Piyal Nishantha. He said compensation will be granted from today. The Cabinet approval had to be taken as there was no circular in this regard. Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that it was for the first that a move was taken to make such a grant to victims of such an accident. When MP Piyal Nishantha said it was not acceptable to cancel the licence of the boat owner by the government, Minister Amaraweera said no fisheries boat is allowed to transport people. There are laws against it. He said the boat owners had done a big mistake.
However, Joint Opposition member Rohitha Abeygunawardena said the people have been transported by the ferryman without the knowledge of the boat owner.
Anura Kumara queries on Wijeweeras property acquisition by govt.
Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake yesterday queried under which law the government acquired the property belonged to JVP founder Rohana Wijeweera in Ulapane.
He also queried as to if the government would hand over the property back to Rohana Wijeweeras family members. He raised the queries as supplementary questions to a question raised by Opposition member Mahindananda Aluthgamage during the round of questions for oral answers. Aluthgamage asked if the government had decided to remove the Vocational Training Centre of the National Youth Services Council at the former JVP Leader Wijeweeras residence in Ulapane. National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Niroshan Perera said such a decision had not been taken by the government.
Meanwhile, JVP MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake asked under which law the government acquired that property and would it take measures to hand it over back to Rohana Wijeweeras family members.
National Policies and Economic Affairs Deputy Minister Niroshan Perera responding to MP Dissanayake said he had to raise a separate question on the issue.

There are written and unwritten practices that have affected our economy and security, is related to the sea around us. It is common to the other Bay of Bengal countries too he add. Due to the economic and strategic importance of the Indian Ocean, the region has become an area of geo-political and geo economic competition for major powers. Fernando said the Trincomalee port area development has been appallingly slow and the road for investment is wide open. It is now limited to wheat milling, cement production, petroleum product development, minor fishery development and tourist service delivery.
India External Affairs Ministry Joint Secretary Santosh Jha said that the growing consciousness of our maritime space is also directly linked to rising centrality of our immediate periphery in our foreign policy many of them being littoral states and in case of Sir Lanka and Maldives are Island nations. This is reflected first and foremost in our neighbourhood first policy, which is a triangulation of fostering stronger contacts, building greater connectivity and forging closer cooperation. Each of the relationships in our neighbourhood has been prioritized and has progressed significantly in recent years. There is a new level of attention given to them as reflected in high level exchanges, some after a gap of several years. They have become more outcome-oriented and consultative while retaining the principle of shared prosperity and security as well as of non-reciprocity. Our strong intent for cooperation has been demonstrated by tackling long-pending and intractable issues such as the maritime and land boundary problem with Bangladesh. Our commitment to make available our capabilities in times of distress has been manifes in our assistance to Nepal during the disastrous earthquake, supply of water to Maldives or support extended to Sri Lanka during landslides and floods last year.
Our development cooperation has also expanded both in terms of range, quality, overall quantum of commitments and pace of implementation. Most important, emphasis on connectivity as a pathway for economic progress and prosperity and for building greater trust and stability has emerged in sharper focus than before.
The PF, in cooperation with Carnegie India and with the support of Japan and Norway, has launched the Trincomalee Consultations to focus on three broad areas: (i) Geo-strategic significance and regional maritime security demands in the Bay of Bengal, (ii) Transportation and economic connectivity in the Bay of Bengal: Way ahead for enhanced cooperation and (iii) Strategic importance and potential for development of the Trincomalee Harbor as a hub for the Bay of Bengal region.

Pledge to end police abuse not met, HRW urges Sri Lanka
The Sri Lankan government has not met its pledge to curtail police abuses prior to the March 2017 session of the United Nations Human Rights Council, Human Rights Watch said today. Security sector reform was one of 25 undertakings by Sri Lanka in the Human Rights Council resolution adopted by consensus in October 2015.
The Sri Lankan government has failed to repeal the abusive Prevention of Terrorism Act or take serious measures to reduce torture in custody, the HRW added.
Its crucial that the Human Rights Council consider closely whether Sri Lanka made progress in the security sector as well as its other commitments such as transitional justice, said Brad Adams, Asia director. Nearly 18 months after making important promises to the council, Sri Lankas leaders appear to be backtracking on key human rights issues, including reforming the police.
Reform of the security sector has lagged behind action on the council resolutions four pillars of transitional justice: accountability, the disappeared, truth-seeking, and reconciliation. A recent report from the UN Special Rapporteur on torture, Juan Mendez, highlighted the ongoing culture of torture in the country. A 2015 report by Human Rights Watch also found that Sri Lankans routinely face torture and other ill-treatment by the police. In the vast majority of cases, the victims were unable to obtain any meaningful redress. The government has also yet to repeal the draconian Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), which has been used to arbitrarily detain terrorism suspects and others without charge for years. During the countrys 26-year-long civil war, the government asserted that the PTA was a necessary tool in its battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam. Yet, nearly eight years after the wars end in May 2009, the PTA not only remains on the books but continues to be used to arrest and detain people.
Lawyers and relatives of PTA detainees told Human Rights Watch in May 2016 that police arrests were still being made in the notorious white vans used by the previous government, creating fear of a return to a culture of enforced disappearances.
The practice has abated somewhat after an outcry from the rejuvenated national Human Rights Commission and rights lawyers. Lawyers, families, and the Human Rights Commission report having access to PTA detainees, an improvement from past practice. A number of those arrested in 2016 under the Prevention of Terrorism Act were implicated in committing or plotting terrorist crimes, Adams said. Yet there was no good reason for not using the regular criminal code rather than an abusive law that should have been repealed years ago.
The Special Rapporteur on torture, following a May 2016 visit to Sri Lanka, found that torture to produce confessions, including beatings, sexual violence, extreme stress positions and asphyxiation, was being committed in police stations, military facilities and detention centers throughout the country.
Human Rights Watchs own investigations found that police routinely use torture to compel confessions for even minor offenses, such as petty theft and making illicit alcohol, and this affected all ethnicities and social groups. The Special Rapporteur described a worrying lack of will within the Attorney Generals Department and the judiciary to investigate and take action against those considered responsible for torture, noting that authorities kept repeating to him that there had been no complaints of ill-treatment or torture, and consequently no investigations.
Deeply embedded practices linked to the war, like police torture, dont just go away once the war is over, Adams said. Curtailing torture in Sri Lanka requires serious reforms of the security sector, prosecutions of those responsible, and sustained political will from the top.
In June 2016, President Maithripala Sirisena issued a directive to the police and military to refrain from torture but the impact of the directive has gone unreported. Legal provisions in violation of international law remain on the books, such as permitting criminal liability at the age of 8. Ensuring the right to counsel at all stages of detention has also not been remedied.
The upcoming Human Rights Council session provides an important opportunity for UN member countries to closely examine the Special Rapporteur on tortures report and the problem of torture and other police abuse in Sri Lanka.
They should press the government to address these concerns as part of the overall reform efforts underway under the Human Rights Council resolution. And they need to be careful not to endorse measures that would set back human rights protections, such as earlier draft counter-terrorism bills to replace the PTA. - HRW

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe wished all Hindus a blessed Maha Sivarathri in a message released to the media today.
The Hindus believe that Maha Siva Rathri is the favoured night of the Lord Shiva; it is spent in the company of friends and family amidst great fellowship.
As a much revered occasion that highlights the values of spiritual enlightenment and culture, the Maha Sivarathri Day is deeply symbolic of co-existence and harmony among all and is also an ideal time for reflection, the Prime Minister said.

President should take over for 24 hours: GMOA
President Maithripala Sirisena should take over the duties of the Health Minister and the Higher Education Minister for 48 hours, do justice and hand them over to them back if the two ministers do not do their official duties regarding the SAITM, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoyza said. Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo 7 yesterday, Dr. Zoysa said it takes only 24 hours for the two ministers to do their official duties towards SAITM and at least the President should order them to do so. Using the powers vested on him by the Medical Ordinance, the Health Minister can sign the 2009 Gazette Notification on the minimum standards of medical education or he can gazette the standards published on the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) website as a booklet.
According to Dr. Zoyza, using the powers vested with the Higher Education Minister by the University Act No. 16 of 1978, he can obtain the Compliance Certificate for the SAITM from the the SLMC or if he fails to do so, he can cancel the `gazette notification' issued by the former Higher Education Minister S.B. Dissanayake.
Dr. Zoyza said both current and former higher education ministers are clowns. No point of talking to them, he said. Doctors cannot be created the way that of creating politicians. They come to Parliament to test their standards, and doctors start serving after proving their standard.
The GMOA has not used its full power to address the issue; if there is no positive answer from the Government, the GMOA does not hesitate to use its full power to solve the issue.
The Health Minister is trying to implement the decision made at his home instead of implementing the decision made by the SLMC because of his `love' towards people.
He should protect or at least keep the current standard of the doctors who prescribe high quality drugs, heart stents and eye lenses which he made available at lower prices for people, he added.

ProMate exercise books  creates sales record
ProMate, a leading Sri Lankan brand of exercise books, manufactured in compliance with international standards, established a new sales record during the last school term, Nalinda Jayamanne, Chief Operation Officer, Printxcel Pvt. Ltd., said.
Inspired by the rich inheritance of 60 years in the domain of publications and printing of government school text books it carries from its parent company, ProMate is all set to take the exercise books landscape to the next level.
Expressing his views on the new sales record achieved by ProMate exercise books, Nalinda Jayamanne, Chief Operation Officer, Printxcel Pvt. Ltd., said With the introduction of ProMate exercise books to the market, the products became exceedingly popular amongst school children within a short period of time. The primary reason the ProMate brand became so well received and widely favored was its superlative quality and refined finish, which are both attractive and appealing. It was because of these distinctive features that we were able to set a new sales record during the last school term.
ProMate exercise books are manufactured using an exclusively picked paper of 70GSM imported from Indonesia. These books are produced in compliance with global standards, taking in to account the health and safety aspects of school-going children, Nalinda Jayamanne stressed.
The production process of these books have been awarded ISO 9001-2008 international certification.
Apart from its ProMate books, Printxcel has also introduced to the market a range of superior quality stationery products under the 'Mango' brand for the use of school, home and office.
The relaunch of Rathna Exercise Books, the well-known brand produced by the prestigious Rathna Publishers, under a new look with the depiction of famous and popular cartoon characters it tipped to be significantly popular amongst children is also in the offing.

In the pursuit of justice
Former Deputy Editor of The Nation newspaper Keith Noyahr was abducted at the entrance of his house, at Waidya Mawatha, Dehiwala, on May 22, 2008.
His was the first in a chain of lethal attacks on journalists, which turned out to be a key characteristic of the Rajapaksa administration.
The incident took place a day after The Nation celebrated its third anniversary: The paper was then owned by Dr. Sena Yaddehige, Chairman of the Arpico group, who ventured into the industry on the backs of two weekend newspapers  Rivira and The Nation.
Nearly two weeks before his abduction, Noyahr - who was also the defense columnist of the newspaper - had written an article titled An Army Is Not Its Commanders Private Fiefdom, severely criticizing the top-brass of the Sri Lankan Army on many matters.
The incident
On the day he was abducted, Noyahr had dinner at Queen's Cafe on Duplication Road, Bambalapitiya, with his Editor, Lalith Allahakkoon, and CEO of The Nation's publisher, Rivira Media Corporation, Krishantha Prasad Cooray.
Noyahr left Queens Caf around 10 that night. He drove his own vehicle to his home, in Dehiwala.
At around 10.30 pm, Noyahrs wife Roshini received a phone call from her husband: He told her he was almost home and asked her to unlock the front door for him.
When her husband had not arrived 15 minutes later, Roshini grew worried. When she checked she heard the rumbling of the car engine near the front entrance of the house.
It was her husbands car  but no one was in it: The engine was running and the lights were on. The drivers door was wide open, but Noyahr was nowhere to be seen.
Roshini immediately sensed that her husband, a well-known defence columnist, was in trouble. She called Gamini Abeywardena, another Deputy Editor attached to The Nation and told him what had happened.
Abeywardena telephoned Allahakkoon, the Editor of The Nation and informed him of the incident. Alahakoon, recognizing immediately the gravity of the situation, rushed to Noyahrs Dehiwala residence.
On his way there, he telephoned his CEO, Krishantha Cooray and briefed him about the phone call from Abeywardena. Cooray, who was in his apartment at the time, also rushed to Dehiwala.
When Allahakkoon and Cooray arrived at Noyahrs house, the journalists two children were crying in distress. They pleaded with Allahakkoon and Cooray to bring their father back.
Allahakkoon, at that point, telephoned Former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the de facto head of the Rajapaksa defence apparatus, and sought his intervention to find the missing journalist. When Allahakkoon said Noyahr was the defence columnist of the paper, Rajapaksa was quick to deny military involvement in the disappearance.
The Nation Editor even spoke to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and urged him to ensure the release of the journalist. Rajapaksa said he was unaware of the incident; but promised to look into the matter.
Cooray spoke to Karu Jayasuriya, who was then a senior Cabinet Minister of the Rajapaksa government, and asked him to intervene in the crisis. Jayasuriya had also telephoned former President Rajapaksa. This intense search operation by Noyahrs colleagues, soon became a nuisance to the top echelons of the government.
Search
Noyahrs colleagues  especially the journalists who had worked with him at The Nation newspaper  gathered at the Dehiwala Police station to exert pressure on authorities to investigate the disappearance, but it was clear that the Police were not in a position to do anything, or that their hands were tied.
Shortly afterwards, the former head of the Colombo Crimes Division (CCD) former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrived at the Dehiwala Police station. Senanayake was known to be a close ally of former Defence Secretary Rajapaksa and his involvement in the investigation raised questions in the minds of the journalists who were present at the Police station.
Senanayake ran into an argument with Cooray when the latter said he suspected three top-notch members of the Rajapaksa defence apparatus to be the main culprits behind the abduction: Cooray had insisted the Police should record his statement - but Senanayake wanted to avoid it. The Senior Police Officer had then ventured that the reason for the abduction might have been a personal dispute.
Cooray and Allahakoon also contacted embassies, media organisations, newsrooms and other influential friends and alerted them on the disappearance. Noyahrs mobile phone was switched off, but Cooray even managed to get a telecommunication service provider to monitor if there were signals from the journalists mobile phone.
Sometime after midnight, Cooray was informed that a mobile transmission tower in the vicinity of Dompe had captured signals from Noyahrs mobile phone  this meant the abductors, or some other party, had switched on his mobile phone, for some reason. It was also lead on the possibility that the journalist was detained in that area.
As Noyahrs colleagues had little faith in Police investigations, they chose to go to Dompe on their own to look for their missing colleague. They got into their personal vehicles and rushed to Dompe in groups.
Dompe was an area in which the military intelligence ran several safe houses during the final stages of war. Therefore, mobile signals coming from the Dompe area was an indication that Noyahr was in the custody of a group attached to the military.
The journalists who went to Dompe in search of Noyahr did not have access to military safe houses, but they looked for remote places in the area, believing that the abductors had abandoned him somewhere, to no avail.
Found
In the wee hours of Friday (May 23), Noyahr was found in Dehiwala  not very far from his residence. His clothes were torn and he was almost unconscious and his body badly bruised. It was clear that the journalist had been beaten up and tortured. He was rushed to the Colombo National Hospital
It became clear that the pressure exerted by Noyahrs colleagues on the government had compelled the abductors to release the journalist: His release also established a connection between the adductors and the top echelons of the previous government.
While Noyahr was still at the Colombo National Hospital, the former Rivira CEO issued a statement explaining the circumstances leading to the attack:
His abduction followed a series of threats issued against him, and, according to Keith's close associates, seemingly because of his regular contributions to The Nation's weekly defence column published under the nom-de-plume Senpathi.
After what seemed like an endless vigil for Keith's family and friends, he was released, but not before being brutally assaulted by his abductors.
I am joined by Keith's colleagues both at The Nation and Rivira and the wider media community, who have recognised both his valour and unprejudiced journalism, and therefore view this attack against him as a despicable act aimed at silencing a pen committed to the truth above all else.
We live in a nation where terrorism is a word much bandied about. Terrorism is words, ideologies and individuals; terrorism is also a convenient label, a weapon to be used against a political detractor and dissident. But terrorism by definition rises beyond individual and organisation.
Keith is a journalist by profession, but he is first and foremost a family man.
On Thursday night, his abductors rendered his two small children hysterical with grief and fear that they might never see their father again, presumably because they disagreed with what he wrote.
Keith remains at the Colombo National Hospital, receiving treatment for injuries sustained, the extent of which is not yet fully known. Journalistic principle aside, it was a heavy price to pay for writing an article.
Despite all evidence pointing to the contrary, we, at Rivira Media Corporation, remain hopeful that the authorities will seek to bring the perpetrators of this heinous act of terrorism to book. We recognise that while a strong campaign to bring Keith's abductors to justice is being waged, there are thousands in the very same plight, without voice and without hope.
In appealing for justice for Keith, we echo the same call for justice to be served to the hundreds and thousands of abductees all over Sri Lanka. We pray that this culture of impunity will be arrested forthwith - already too many have paid the highest price to satisfy the whims of a few.
We take this opportunity to thank our colleagues in the media for their stoic and unending support in this time of crisis. Keith, had he been in a better condition, would have been the first to recognise this support and offer his thanks.
It was Keith, more than any of us, who was the defender of media rights; he was at every protest against the obstruction of media freedom, he would personally insist on articles being published about journalists killed for doing their job. He embodied the best of journalism in this country.
One by one, journalists in this country have been silenced. When they have not been killed to stop them reporting, they have been intimidated into reluctance to pick up a pen again. We call on our colleagues in the media therefore, to stand up against this injustice. We urge you to join with us in a campaign to bring about true democracy in this country.
May our calls be stronger than ever before; may our struggle prove a force to be reckoned with. It is a moment for collective solidarity, a time to shun rivalry, a time to stand up for each other against the forces that seek to silence and destroy us.
Let us step up to the challenge, for Keith Noyahr, for the countless other scribes and perhaps for ourselves.
Noyahr later revealed he had been questioned by the abductors about his sources:
They wanted to know who gave him the information he used in his defense column.
The journalist left for Australia no sooner he was released from the Colombo National Hospital and never returned.
Investigation
Now, nearly eight years after the incident, on the back of the good governance government, the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) has launched an investigation into the attack.
The CID recorded statements from many individuals who worked with Noyahr at the time of the incident and have also contacted the journalist to seek his cooperation to proceed with the inquiry.
Noyahrs friends and the media fraternity have expressed relief that the investigation is finally seeing light.
On Saturday (18), the Criminal Investigations Department revealed it had arrested five Army personnel in connection with the attack that took place in May 2008, affirming the suspicions by Noyahrs friends and colleagues, that the abduction had the backing of the military.
Among them is Major Bulathwatte, a senior Military officer  who is also believed to be involved in the assault on former Rivira Editor Uplai Tennekoon, seven months later.
The five men have been remanded till March 02 and the CID will continue investigations. But the question of who gave the order to abduct Noyahr remains unanswered.
Neither Major Bulathwatte nor any of the other military personnel suspected involved in the attack have any personal reasons for wanting to know who Noyahrs sources were.
It is a clear and accepted fact they were merely carrying out orders given by higher authorities.
Finding these higher authorities will be the next challenge posed to the CID and other authorities tasked with the investigations  especially in light of the fact that none of the big fish implicated in any of the nets case wide by the various investigative agencies  the Bribery Commission, the FCID et al  have made any progress, in this regard.

Rich habits of rich people
Rich people are different. How are they different, though Well talk about the rich habits that will put you on the path to wealth.
Dave Ramsey published a list of twenty things the rich do every day. Actually, this list is twenty-one items long but because of the crap formatting, the second item is mixed in with the first. Its also worded strangely, and some of the items are repetitive.
Junk Food
70% of wealthy eat less than 300 junk food calories per day. 97% of poor people eat more than 300 junk food calories per day.
If you dont feed yourself well, you dont feel well, and you cant think well. And that makes it hard to have the energy and focus to pursue your goals. Eating well can mean lots of different things, Paleo, vegan, vegetarian, pescatarian. Eating poorly is easier to define, and we all know it when we see it. No one thinks cake is healthier than a carrot.
You can drill down into all sorts of minutia when it comes to healthy eating, but the basics are pretty, well, basic! Eat a lot of vegetables, eat a little fruit. Eat plenty of protein and healthy fats. Eliminate refined carbs and keep the slow burning carbs to a minimum if youre trying to lose weight. Its really no more complicated than that.
Gambling
23% of wealthy gamble. 52% of poor people gamble.
People making less than $13,000 a year spend 9% of their income on lottery tickets. There is a reason the lottery is called the Fools Tax. There is nothing wrong with buying the occasional lottery ticket for fun or setting aside a certain amount of money you can afford to lose on a trip to Vegas, but if youre spending 9% of your income on gambling, you will never be rich.
Singular Goals
80% of wealthy are focused on accomplishing some single goal. Only 12% of the poor do this.
Wealthy people have a goal. And not just a vague goal but a clearly defined goal and a plan to achieve it. Its great that you want to quit your job and start your own business, but if you have no plan of action to make that happen, its not really a goal. Its just a day dream.
For any goal you have, getting out of debt, saving 50% of your income, losing 50 pounds, there is a world of information out there that will show you the steps you need to take to achieve it.
Exercise
76% of wealthy exercise aerobically four days a week. 23% of poor do this.
Exercising goes hand in hand with eating well. Regular exercise helps to boost mood and energy. It helps control weight, makes you sleep better, and makes sex better. Exercise is especially important for those of us who have sedentary jobs. Sitting all day is terrible for you, and while exercise doesnt offset it entirely, it would be worse if you were doing no exercise.
Exercise is like diet; there is no one size fits all. The best exercise is the one you will do so find something you enjoy. Walking is very underated as a form of exercise. Almost anyone can do it, and you dont need special equipment or a gym membership.
Audio Books
63% of wealthy listen to audio books during commute to work vs. 5% of poor people.
Okay, this one is sort of weird, so well put our own spin on it. Listening to something like an audio book or a podcast on your way to work is more benefical than listening to the wacky antics of the 99.5 Morning Zoo.
Listen to something educational (Listen Money Matters) or something inspirational. The point is to use that time to listen to something that will feed your brain rather than listening to morning DJs make prank phone calls.
To Do List
81% of wealthy maintain a to-do list vs. 19% of poor.
Always make a to-do list before you go to bed at night. It helps keep intrusive thoughts out of your head. I need to remember to cancel my dentist appointment. I need to call the bank about that odd charge on my credit card. You dont want to lay in bed thinking about stuff like that. Writing it down gets it out of your mind.
Here is a neat trick that works for me. If I know the following day is going to be a rough one, I write down even tiny things on my list like, eat breakfast, drop that letter in the post box. That way, I get to cross them off my list, and it gives me a little boost of feeling accomplished. Sounds silly but try it.
Non-Fiction
63% of wealthy parents make their children read two or more non-fiction books a month vs. 3% of poor.
I think this goes back to using free time to educate yourself. I prefer non-fiction and always have, but I think there is something to be learned from nearly anything you read, even if its just learning a new word. The trick to enjoying non-fiction is to find a subject that youre really interested in and dive in. Reading non-fiction often becomes a rabbit hole because one book tends to lead to the next. As long as youre reading something, Im happy.
Volunteer
70% of wealthy parents make their children volunteer 10 hours or more a month vs. 3% of poor.
Ramsey doesnt elaborate on these, so I had to interpret this one too. Volunteering is proven to increase happiness. And its happiness that didnt cost anything. Thats a valuable lesson, that you dont have to spend money to be happy.
Volunteering is also a good way to make connections that might help you in the future. It can help teach social skills and gives you a sense of purpose. It can also give you perspective. No matter how sad you are, you arent as sad as a puppy in a shelter waiting for a forever home. No matter how big your problems are, they will pale in comparison to a little kid in the hospital waiting for a kidney transplant. But you helped the puppy and you helped the little kid by giving your time and thats something to feel good about.
Happy Birthday!
80% of wealthy make Happy Birthday calls vs. 11% of poor.
This one probably has to do with having close social relationships. People who have connections to other people are happier, and when youre happy, youre more successful. Remembering birthdays of those close to you is an important way to foster relationships. Weve all had a friend or loved one forget our birthday, and it hurts.
Write Down Goals
67% of wealthy write down their goals vs. 17% of poor.
Its proven that if you write down your goals, you are more likely to achieve them. The act of writing things down helps to keep them in the forefront of our minds. Take it a step further and break down your goals into things you can do today, this week, this month, and this year to reach them. How do you eat an elephant One bite at a time. Writing down each bite makes things more manageable.
If your goal is to save $500 in a month, today you can make coffee at home rather than buying it on the way to the office. For the week, you can bring your lunch to work. For the month, you can become a cord cutter and get rid of cable, research a cheaper phone plan, and sell three items just sitting around your house on eBay. Write down the goals and the steps to get there.
Read
88% of wealthy read 30 minutes or more each day for education or career reasons vs. 2% of poor.
The reading thing is getting a little repetitive but the point stands, reading is important. If you want the most bang for your buck, read a book that will teach you something. Maybe you want to learn to be rich or how to Master Mint.
Bite Your Tongue
6% of wealthy say whats on their mind vs. 69% of poor.
Sometimes it pays to bite your tongue. Boss being a dick Dont call your boss a dick. Customer making unreasonable demands Dont tell the customer to get bent. Its important to pick your battles. Sometimes you just have to eat shit. Have you ever had a friend with a temper who was always getting fired This is likely the reason. They called the boss a dick and told the customer to get bent.

Roshanga Wickremesinghe launches book on growth and competitiveness
Management Consultant Roshanga Wickremesinghe, with fourteen years in delivering high impact consulting, training, facilitation and coaching solutions in 17 countries, launched his book on How small countries can compete and grow - a case for Sri Lanka on February 16.
The idea of writing this book came to me as a way of documenting the observations and many discussions which I have been a part of as a facilitator, trainer, coach and management consultant, working across many sectors since 2002, Wickremesinghe said.
His strategising includes working with major international organisations such as The International Development Research Centre, Union Network International, South Asian Federation of Accountants, South East Asian Press Alliance and Health Action International to name a few as well as major corporates in Sri Lanka.
The launch was attended by Directors, CEO's and senior managers of leading corporates as well as researchers from academia.
The easy to read and well articulated book enables even a lay person to understand the critical issues faced by Sri Lanka and the importance of enhancing its capabilities in order to survive in a highly competitive global environment.
Wickremesinghe uses his analytical skills combined with practical solutions to complex situations, he advocates a research backed scientific development approach to solving impending issues and urges policy makers to initiate early action that would help Sri Lanka to compete and grow. In her foreword, Dr Ranee Jayamaha says I am, confident that this book would serve as an important reference for policy makers, regulators, local and foreign investors, the academia, students and the general public.
Wickremesinghe set up R & R Associates Consulting in 2002 as an International Management Consultancy and Training practice in Sri Lanka. Categorised as a sector independent strategic planning specialist, R & R Associates Consulting, have delivered services to governments, bilateral organizations, private sector companies, non governmental organizations (in Sri Lanka and overseas), as well as international foundations and associations.

School leavers should be equipped for labour market: Akila
The greatest social responsibility Sri Lanka has in education is to ensure that school leavers are equipped to join the labour market and to decide on appropriate further studies, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The Minister was delivering the keynote speech at the World CSR Day held from 17-18 February in Mumbai.
Over 1000 professionals from 130 countries congregated with the objective of providing a platform to the corporate, government, civil society and academia to share their expectations, aspirations and responsibilities.
In his address, the Minister emphasised the importance of education in supporting Sustainable Development Goals (SGDs). "Sri Lanka has initiated educational reforms that would have a far reaching impact on achieving SDGs in the country. The Government emphasised on skills development and vocational education. These policies would ensure that students in secondary schools receive education in the streams of their choice. A new stream in vocational studies is also being introduced. With the skills and work attitudes the youth receive, they will join the market place with confidence, and the school dropout rate will drop to a near zero. This is one of the great social responsibilities in education in Sri Lanka, Minister Akila said.
Representatives of a number of Sri Lankan institutes and companies including Women in Management, Dialog Axiata PLC, and Hemas Pharmaceutical (Pvt) Limited received awards.

Selecting a qualified security assessor  for banks, financial institutions

The recent ATM security data breach in the SAARC Region is an alarming situation where banks and financial institutions need to start thinking and focusing on safeguarding their systems to avoid similar breaches in future.
It has been said in media reports that the breach would have possibly affected 3.2 million debit cardholders.
A data breach has been linked with a serious compromise of a leading payment card processor company in India which in turn has raised a serious alarm for the entire payment card industry and leave us with a thought that we have to re-think on security and not just compliance - card processor company was said to be following the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (Version 3.2), Also known as PCI-DSS, intended to safeguard cardholder data.
However, still the majority of the companies are not in full compliance with the PCI-DSS standard. PCI standard is very effective in reducing breaches if we understand the intent behind each requirement and implement them smoothly with the support of good standing Qualified Security Assessor would help organisations to prevent themselves from such occurrence of similar breach.
Security and not just compliance - As an industry we should admit that we have missed behind the importance of information security and have started focusing on just compliance by compromising on security with the cost, technical expertise and lack of adaption with new technologies.
Payment card processors/ Merchants/ Banks/ Payment Gateways are usually expected to comply with the Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI-DSS), a code of security best practice designed to guard from external and internal attacks and thwart hackers to penetrate into the network, database, and application servers from obtaining card holder details. Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS) is an information security standard aimed at creating an additional level of protection for card issuers and acquirer's by ensuring that merchants and Third Party Payment Processors and Payment gateways meet a minimum level of security while they are storing, processing and or transmitting cardholder data.
The PCI-DSS audit should be always seen as a security consulting assessment, rather than just an audit to achieve a certificate or a piece of paper. Successful engagement starts with choosing the right Qualified Security Assessor, Organisation should select someone who influences you with their competence and have bandwidth to work well with your team. We should never hide any facts or past history from our Qualified Security Assessor. We need to keep a tab on few things that need to be considered while we are hiring a Qualified Security Assessor to conduct the PCI-DSS audit and certification exercise.
Industry Best Practices for Implementing PCI DSS
1. Implement Payment Best Security Practices (such as PCI DSS, PA DSS and PCI PIN Standards) effectively.
2. Payment Security Training like CPISI should be made mandatory for all individuals inside a payments organisation including CISO's/Security Managers of the organisation.
3. Don't let your procurement teams choose your security auditor. Focus on deep payment security expertise rather than only on cost.
4. Technology is as good as its implementation. Focus on effective implementation and do not get complacent by just installing a black box in your environment.
5. Senior Management should play a large role in chalking the payment security strategy for the organisation as it impacts their brand reputation. Five finest steps to select a Qualified Security Assessor (QSA)
Firstly and foremost, it is vital to research on identifying a Qualified Security Assessor organization that has a good standing in the market. Verification can be done from PCI-SSC website. Avoid going with the lower cost Vendor.
A Qualified Security Assessor with a higher proposition might actually end up saving you money in the long run.
Secondly, Reference check on a Qualified Security Assessor Organization from companies that have experience in your industry with working with them will help you a lot in taking a concrete decision.
Thirdly, if your existing vendor guarantee you that you will be compliant within 6 to 8 months time and put a certain date, you need to be cautious about that person or company immediately. If you select them and if a breach happens, you are the one who will be held responsible for the breach and damage will be to your company's reputation and market share.
Fourthly, Engagement should be such where Qualified Security Assessor or Consultant has to be onsite dedicated for conducting the assessment and providing the remediation support to the organization in order to achieve the success rate of getting the organization compliant on other side some of the work like drafting and reviewing the documentation can be done remotely. Lastly, you should interview a Qualified Security Assessor face to face and identify the above security specialist qualities that he or she should possess.
