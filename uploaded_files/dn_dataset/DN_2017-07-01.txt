Parents struggle over SAITM should aim to send goverment home
"The protest of university students' parents against the SAITM should be conversted to a struggle to send government home, National Freedom Front Parliamentarian Jayantha Samaraweera said.
He was addressing the media at the N.M. Perera Centre, Borella recently.
Samaraweera said the Joint Opposition will support university students' struggle against the SAITM.
He said the government lost Rs 15,000 million income due to the tax reduction on imported milk powder. The parliamentarian said the Colomb city has become a garbage dump due to the absence of proper garbage disposal procedure. "The whole country was poluted with poisonous gas," he said.

Archbishop protests dumping of garbage in Muthurajawela
Colombo Archbishop Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith while lodging a strong protest against the dumping of garbage in the Muthurajawela area yesterday.
He appealed to the government to find a long term solution to the issue without causing destruction to human life and the environment.
He urged the government to stop haphazard dumping of garbage and find a viable solution without causing destruction to human life and environment.
The Colombo Archbishop in a statement added that the Colombo Municipal Council and some of the Government Agencies responsible in the clearing of garbage in the city have commenced dumping garbage without any concern for environmental damage in the Muthurajawela area again.
As a result of this action the vast Muthurajawela marsh which has been gazetteted under the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act will be exposed to great danger and destruction, he said.
He stressed that the present attitude of dumping garbage at various places without a proper study of its ill effects cannot be accepted.
The full statement: I have been made to understand that the Colombo Municipal Council and some of the Government Agencies responsible in the clearing of garbage collected in the city have started to dump the garbage without any concern for the environmental damage in the Muturajawela area once again.
What is more serious is the fact that even human body parts that are discarded from hospitals and mortuaries have been taken and dumped in Muturajawela at a palace where there is water.
Thus, the water ways have started to experience severe pollution and it will seep into the Negombo Lagoon causing immense harm to human life in the Negombo, Ja-Ela, Dandugama and Katunayaka areas. It will also destroy the fishing resources in the Negombo Lagoon.
Besides many have observed that this is being done haphazardly without any study of the suitability of the location for such dumping.
As a result of this action the vast Muturajawela marsh which has been gazetted under the Environmental Protection and Conservation Act will be exposed to great danger and destruction. Hence, we wish to lodge our strongest protest against this action. We believe that there should be a more eco-friendly and long standing solutions to the problem of garbage collected in the city of Colombo. We cannot accept the present attitude of taking the garbage and dumping it in all kinds of places without a proper study of its ill effects and the threat to human life it would bring.
And so I wish to appeal to the Government, Colombo Municipal Council and the responsible officials to stop this haphazard dumping of garbage and to find a long term solution to this problem in a way that it does not cause destruction to human life and to the environment.

Bicycle celebrates little-known 200th anniversary
Domazan: For the next month the eyes of the sporting world will be on the Tour de France, yet few people know what a significant year this is for the bicycle.
Much to the chagrin of amateur historian Claude Reynaud, the 200th anniversary of the invention of the bicycle is likely to pass by with little pomp or fanfare as millions of pairs of eyes gaze at television screens or from the roadside to watch Chris Froome and his rivals battle for yellow jersey glory.
And yet, the 104th edition of the worlds most prestigious cycle race starts in Dusseldorf on Saturday, in the country where 200 years ago Baron Karl Drais invented the bicycle.
Billions of people use bicycles, many on a daily basis, and yet few are aware of this important milestone.
No-one is celebrating it because the information is unknown, complained Reynaud, a viticulturist from the south east of France.
While the Tour de France starts in Dusseldorf this year, when the Grand Boucle presented its route, no-one evoked the bicentenary -- its unknown outside of a small circle of initiates.
Reynaud has fought a 50-year battle to defend the memory of the invention of the bicycle.
He even houses a museum in its honour at his chateau in Domazan, in the Occitanie region of France.
I could talk about it for hours, Reynaud said of the history of the bicycle, his gravelly voice almost drowned out by the sound of crickets.
He has written several self-published books on the subject that are sold only at his chateau.
Its from passion, he said of his tireless labours.
Reynaud said it was on June 12, 1817 that for the first time, a man took a two-wheeler and went on a road in the Mannheim region of what was then the Grand Duchy of Baden, now part of southwest Germany.
Baron Draiss velocipede (nicknamed the dandy horse) had no pedals or a chain and required the rider to propel his Laufmaschine (running machine) by pushing off the ground with his feet.
But the Barons genius was that he discovered balance on two wheels, said Reynaud.
Like all ingenious inventions, it seems obvious, but someone had to think it. He invented the two-wheeler!
However, the running machine was far from a resounding success and had its faults, notably proving difficult to control on bumpy surfaces. When Drais organised a demonstration of the velocipede at the Jardin de Luxembourg park in Paris in 1818, it was a disaster.
People thought it was ridiculous and made cartoons about it, said Reynaud, who has included some of those caricatures in his museum.
At first, it didnt work, he couldnt sell it, people made fun of it.
But the idea had taken root and was soon being copied, particularly in France, although many draisines (as it was known there) were adorned with horses heads.
In 1866, Pierre Lallement attached pedals to the draisine and invented a pedal-powered velocipede.
The next stage in the development of the bicycle saw a huge front wheel attached with a small rear wheel, but it was a machine that was far from stable and resulted in some spectacular crashes.
It wasnt until 1885 that two similar-sized wheels were attached to the velocipede.
After that it was just a case of technical improvements, but all the ideas already existed -- brake cables, pedals, chains, said Reynaud.
The bicycle enjoyed an exponential success, especially from 1890 with the invention of the tyre.
Reynauds Chateau de Bosc welcomes 6,000 visitors a year to its museum but the amateur historians greatest regret is that he doesnt own an original Laufmaschine to put on display.
There are only four left and they belong to national museums. Theyre out of reach, Ill never have one.

Canada at 150
Today is a monumental day for Canadians living all over the world. Canada turns 150 today. It was on July 1, 1867 that a few provinces and territories come together to form Canada, the second biggest country in the world in terms of total area, next to Russia. The name Canada is now generally accepted as originating from the St. Lawrence Iroquoian word Kanata or Canada, meaning "village" or "settlement".
Canada has a chequered history and as the origin of the very name denotes, Canada has been occupied by native people long before the Europeans set foot there in the 1600s. Starting in the late 15th century, French and British expeditions explored, colonized, and fought over various places in North America in what is present day Canada. In 1867, the Province of Canada was joined with two other British colonies of New Brusnwick and Nova Scotia through Confederation, forming a self-governing entity named Canada. The new dominion expanded, finishing with Newfoundland and Labrador in 1949.
Today, Canada consists of the provinces of Alberta, British Columbia, Manitoba, New Brunswick, Newfoundland, Nova Scotia, Ontario, Saskatchewan. Quebec and Prince Edward Island and the territories of Northwest, Yukon and Nunavut. French-speaking Quebec held a referendum some years back on the question of independence and most Quebec residents opted to remain in the union, though there still are occasional calls for separation. Canada retains the Queen as the Head of State.
Since the Second World War, over 10 million immigrants have come to Canada and many of them have become enthusiastic Canadians. Canada is now home to people from all over the world who speak hundreds of languages including Sinhala and Tamil. Modern Canada is a multi-ethnic, multi-cultural melting pot that showcases the very essence of diversity. Canada has just 36 million people, most of whom live in cities and urban centres such as Toronto, Montreal, Ottawa, Edmonton and Vancouver. Given the sheer size of the country, it needs more people for a diverse range of vocations. Canada thus has one of the worlds leading and fairly liberal immigration programmes.
There are around 500,000 Lankans domiciled in Canada, who enrich the socio-economic fabric of their adopted country in numerous ways. Most of them have family back home and remit funds to them. Every year, hundreds of Sri Lankan families migrate legally to Canada to the extent that almost every Sri Lankan family has a friend or relative in Canada. This is just one aspect of the close relationship between Canada and Sri Lanka which have many things in common, from the English language to the Commonwealth membership. Total two-way trade between the two countries amounts to around US$ 500 million per year and efforts are underway to raise this figure in the coming years. Sri Lanka is fast becoming a major destination for Canadian tourists. Sri Lanka and Canada, whose bilateral relationship soured somewhat over human rights concerns during the tenure of the previous Government, now enjoy robust ties following a new approach to ties with the West by the present Government.
Canada seeks to give pride of place to its First Nation peoples, having formally apologised eight years ago for the former Indian Residential Schools programme which separated over 150,000 Aboriginal children from their families and communities. With the recent release of the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) Report, the Canadian Government has accepted its failings in the horrendous saga in which seven generations of native children were scarred by physical, emotional and sexual abuse in the schools, which often resembled violent prisons. The Government has promised a total renewal of the relationship between Ottawa and the indigenous people and to address the many problems that still affect them, from poverty to the lack of facilities in reservations.
Canada shares the worlds longest (virtually) unguarded land border with the United States of America. The two countries share a very close relationship. Over the course of the last 150 years, Canada has been heavily influenced socially, culturally and economically by its Superpower Southern neighbour. However, far from living under the shadow of its powerful neighbour, Canada has managed to carve its own identity on the world stage, especially after the advent of flamboyant and charismatic Prime Minister Justin Trudeau, son of former Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau. Even as the USA has retreated from international obligations such as the Paris Climate Accord, Canada has stood its ground and articulated the need to fight climate change. The Canadian economy is booming too. There is no doubt that Trudeau is charting a new course for Ottawa, one which will see the country taking an even more active role in world affairs as it looks forward to the next 150 years.
Today, all Canadians in Canada and elsewhere will celebrate what Canada represents to much of the world  a nation of freedom and peace, vast natural beauty and economic opportunity. Canada is truly at a crossroads on its 150th anniversary, striving to rectify the injustices of the past and looking forward to moulding a brighter future for all its citizens.

Central Bank officers invested in govt. securities
The officers attached to the Public Debt Department of the Central Bank invested in government securities during their career at the Bank, proceedings at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury bond issue revealed.
Former Senior Assistant Director of the Central Banks IT Department Sulochana Wickramasooriya giving evidence however said that he was unaware if the said officers invested in government securities during the time they were working in the Public Debt Department. I am aware of officers who invested in government securities (who at somepoint were attached to the PDD), but I am not sure whether they invested while they were working in the Public Debt Department. Wickramasooriya explained to the Commission. Wickramasooriya was summoned before the Presidential Commission based on the evidence given by former Chief Dealer of the Bank of Ceylon J.D.K.Dharmapala.
According to Dharmapalas testimony before the Commission, an officer from the Central Bank appeared at the Bank of Ceylon to invest on Treasury bonds at a rate of 12.25 on the day prior to the questioned Treasury bond auction that took place on February 27,2015. The said officer is Sulochana Wickramasooriya.
Dharmapala in his testimony stated that the said officer came to the Bank of Ceylon on February 26,2015,and forwarded an application to invest on Treasury bonds, while bringing a sum of Rs.750,000 with him.
Commissioner Justice Jayawardena questioned Wickramasooriya on the rate that the witness was interested to invest in Treasury bonds.
Wickramasooriya said, he thought that he was looking for a rate around 11.00 to invest. He also said, he decided on such a rate considering the previous fixed deposit rates. Justice Jayawardena pointed out the fixed deposit rates at the time were much lower to the rate Wickramasooriya was looking for. Following the questioning of Justice Jayawardena,it was also revealed that Wickramasooriya had a government securities account since 2005.
Justice Jayawardena asked Wickramasooriya as to why he wanted to invest specifically at the February 15, 2015 auction, to which the witness said that he thought it would be a good invest. Justice Jayawardena asked as to why he did not invest at the previous Treasury bond auction, to which Wickramasooriya said he did not have the time and the space to do so. Justice Jayawardena pointed out that the witness has approached the Bank of Ceylon on February 26,2015, in his office hours. Meanwhile, Senior Assistant Director Steffie Fernando, attached to the Public Debt Department, Front Office, was also summoned before the Commission yesterday to testify regarding certain telephone conversations she had with former Chief Dealer of the BOC on February 27,2015.
Asked whether there was an indicative rate for the February 27,2015 auction, Fernando said there was not. She said the discussed rate of 9.35 in the telephone conversations was the approved rate for the last 30-year direct placement issued. Fernando also said she was transferred from the Front Office to the Middle Office on the 06 March 2016. Justice Jayawardena asked her whether she is aware as to who transferred her and as to why. Fernando said she is unaware as to who
wanted to transfer her or why she was transferred.
My Head of the Division told me that one officer is to be transferred into the Front Office and there is no choice but to transfer me to the Middle Office, she explained.
Asked as to how the Front Office communicated with the Primary Dealers,Fernando said it was a two way communication where both the Primary Dealer and the Front Office initiated conversations.
Fernando is further to be questioned by the lawyers representing Perpetual Treasuries Limited and former Governor Arjun Mahendran next Monday (03).

China-Lanka cooperation beneficial to both countries: SIIS president
Shanghai Institutes for International Studies (SIIS) President Chen Dongxiao said yesterday that Chinese infrastructure development in Sri Lanka will greatly help the country attract more foreign direct investments in the future.
He said that cooperation in various fields between China and Sri Lanka has flourished in the past decades, contributing to the sustainable development of Sri Lanka and bringing tangible benefits to the people of both countries.
China will always stand together with Sri Lanka to strive for achieving sustainable social and economic development goals following the international multinational agendas which will help improve the financial, social and economic connectivity between Sri Lanka and the world, he said.
Addressing the media briefing in Shanghai yesterday,Chen Dongxiao said that China came forward to support infrastructure development at a time the foreign investors refused to come to Sri Lanka and development initiatives were halted during the war period. In order to acive these goals, we set up the China-Sri Lanka Cooperation Studies Centre (CSLCSC) at the Pathfinder Foundation (PF) headquarters recently,Chen Dongxiao said.
The center will undertake research and studies to recognise the sectors of economic cooperation, investment and promote people to people relations that would serve to further strengthen bilateral cooperation. The Centre is also expected to provide a linkage, facilitating contacts between think-tanks, academics and researchers of the two countries, whose contributions would take Sino-Sri Lanka relations to a higher level of excellence, he added.
We have an idea of promoting research facilities between the two countries which will further help create more opportunities in economic,social and cultural development. He said the Sri Lankan government needs to consider providing a more conducive security environment for the smooth implementation of ongoing projects, Chen Dongxiao said.
We must work together to improve laws and reduce institutional costs for the success of these projects, he added. It is also very difficulty to progress without enhancing people to people contacts, he added.
Sri Lanka has been an active player in maritime cooperation and marine protection activities in the region. Hence, We have planned to strengthen maritime cooperation between China and the Indian Ocean region in order to protect marine environment, he said. Institute for International Strategic Studies and Center for Asia Pacific Studies Senior Fellow Liu Zongyi said since the two countries established diplomatic relations 60 years ago, China and Sri Lanka have had a close bi-lateral corporation supporting each other on issues concerning their core and significant interests.
Chinese investments in Sri Lanka would defiantly stimulate other countries to invest in Sri Lanka, Liu Zongyi said.

Fielding is hard work  Gurusinha
Asanka Gurusinha, cricket manager of the Sri Lanka team described fielding as hard work.
To me its a very simple thing its hard work. I saw that report about flat feet and all of that but it comes down to hard work in everything whether you bat or bowl youve got to field, said Gurusinha.
I believe from the time I came we didnt spend enough time doing fielding training. I was very vocal about it internally because I realized if we go on like that we will never get anywhere. We have changed a lot its still work in progress.
Nic Pothas coming in has changed the intensity of training. Its so sad that in the Champions Trophy just one game ruined everything for us because until then we were pretty good although not brilliant. We have improved from Bangladesh but just one game brought us back pretty much to where we were. This side has to lift that standard and do it under pressure. Working hard to me is a very simple thing, he said.
Fielding has become a major issue with the national cricket team with simple catches being spilled and a lot of misfields taking place on the field that has left many cricket fans tearing their hairs out.
Gurusinha attributes the drop in Sri Lankan fielding standards to the players not being put through their paces by the local coaching staff.
With Nic we can see things changing. Nic is very hard working as a person and his work ethic is unbelievable. It will come down to the team to work that hard and I can see that happening, said Gurusinha.
This morning we had a session it was only a short 20-25 minutes but the intensity was very high and the players did brilliantly. Thats what I like to see and thats pretty much like we used to do. We might do short sessions but then we will do it very well. With some young guys in I am hoping our standard will lift but we need to be consistent.
Gurusinha was part of a Sri Lankan team that was brilliant in its fielding and went onto win the Cricket World Cup in 1996 under the guidance of coach Dav Whatmore and physio Alex Kountouri.

Ford didnt agree to certain SLC policies - Gurusinha
The sudden departure of South African-born Graham Ford from his position as head coach of the Sri Lanka cricket team took many by surprise especially after serving only 17 months of his 45-month contract with Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) which ran until the 2019 World Cup.
There were many unconfirmed reports that appeared in the media relating to Fords departure but no one actually came out with the real reasons behind his resignation, until now.
Asanka Gurusinha, a key member of Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup winning side and currently cricket manager of the national team was of the view that Ford was not too happy with certain policies laid down by Sri Lanka Cricket and that was the reason for his resignation.
Fordy has been talking to me a little bit about certain things that were happening but I didnt expect him to leave overnight like this. I thought if he was going to resign he would first sit with SLC and discuss things like grooming another coach or something like that. He didnt mostly agree with SLC policies and it is very difficult if you are not prepared to fall in line, it becomes a bit of a problem. Thats the reason why he and SLC decided to part, Gurusinha told the Daily News.
What SLC is trying to do is to make everyone accountable. Including me all the coaches have to be accountable. Most probably thats an area that affected him I dont know whether he didnt really enjoy that part because at the end of the day everyone is accountable. The main thing what Ive heard was that he wasnt agreeing with some of the policies of SLC.
Fordy and I got on very well I didnt have issues with him. He is a gentleman no doubt, a great guy. It is sad to lose him but at the same time it gives opportunity to others and us as well. Nic Pothas to me is a hands-on coach who understands our culture very well because hes got a Greek background with similar culture. He is very direct with people and very hard working. When I look at both sides I feel okay, we lost a coach but then there are so many opportunities for SLC to go forward, Gurusinha said.
I was never into coaching I never got involved in coaching unless the coach asked me and I will not do it even now. I am qualified and I have all the qualifications in coaching but I believe its not my role right now. I dont have experience in coaching a national team and I will not put my hand up and say give it to me when there are more competent coaches to take over.
Gurusinha, a left-hand number three batsman of repute compared his sudden departure from Sri Lanka shortly after winning the World Cup in 1996 to reasons similar to Ford. He was only 29 and reaching the peak of his career when he decided to take his family and move to Australia.
l left Sri Lanka because I didnt agree with some of the things that was happening, the decisions made by the national selectors and some of the board officials at the time. It is something that happened with Fordy. If you dont agree you better move away, explained Gurusinha.
Do I have regrets No. I spent 21 years in Australia its a long time. I was in sales and marketing for that 21 years which I was really enjoying. My children are big (they are age 28 and 24) thats why I agreed to come back when Aravinda (de Silva) and Thilanga (Sumathipala) spoke to me.
Ive had offers before about five or six times but with the children and all those commitments I thought that was not the right time. Ive always wanted to give something back to Sri Lanka cricket because where I am now as cricket manager and even in Australia for 21 years it was because of Sri Lanka cricket.
When I came in I felt the team which was inexperienced needed someone like me to get them to the next level. If you had Mahela (Jayawardene) and Sanga (Kumar Sangakkara) you dont need me because you have two greats who can run the team. I have never played with those two but what Ive heard is that they were very strong leaders and they used to run training sessions and all of that. Their work ethic was superb and young guys followed them.
Gurusinha said that SLC realized that there was a gap with regard to a lot of communication issues and his role is working and coordinating with the national team, the head coach and rest of the support staff, with the selectors as well as SLC.
The role hasnt changed at all from the first day. My role is high performance and identifying talent, what players to look at in the next 12-18 months with Simon Willis (the High Performance Manager) for the future and looking at the top 30 contracted players. We need to make sure we use them in a better way, said Gurusinha.
Player management is another area we have 8 Test matches and 18 ODIs till December. Player management is a major part which I am coordinating and working with the selectors (because I am a selector as well) and training staff especially the fast bowlers. If we keep playing them they will get injured with so much cricket being played.
Gurusinhas contract runs upto the 2019 Cricket World Cup and what he intends achieving by then is to help Sri Lanka win another World Cup.
The goal is pretty much to win the World Cup but then there is so much work to be done. After every tour I am looking at our performances going up. We have broken it down to different levels after every tour so we know by the end of this year where we need to be and what we need to get there, said Gurusinha.
We got to win as well because if you dont you lose confidence and also overall the sponsorships keep going down because nobody wants to support a losing side. Rankings also these days are very important. You need to keep performing consistently but at the same time on another level keep developing players whom we can get into the team at any time.
What Sanath (Jayasuriya) and I are working with the rest of the selectors is to have a 20-member group we have identified for Test and ODIs and try to work with that 20 for the next 12 to 18 months. We have a program of shadow cricketers as well so we know if someone is injured whom we can bring in.
We dont want to bring any players just picking them for scoring a hundred we want them to be in the system first to realise our fitness schedules. Some guys when you bring them into the squad they struggle with the intensity of our training. We want them to understand our fitness and fielding levels not just only their skills. What I am trying to do is get the same intensity with the A team and Under 19 squads so that when we bring in a player he is ready to go which is not happening right now.
Describing the talent available in the country as phenomenal Gurusinha said: Sri Lanka is a country that will never grow short of talent but the important thing is talent alone is not enough. If you are playing international cricket fitness plays a major part and one percent you need to push the players. When you are training thats what Nic (Pothas) and I try to get into the team. When the going is tough, push yourself a little bit and get up and do it. That is how you win matches consistently. You need that energy from somewhere to come out and do it. That is what we are working on.

FR against Hambantota framework agreement dismissed
The Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara seeking an order to quash the Framework Agreement entered into by the Government of Sri Lanka with two Chinese companies over Hambantota development project was yesterday dismissed by the Supreme Court.
A majority of a divided three-judge-Supreme Court Bench yesterday decided to dismiss the petition in limine after upholding preliminary objections raised by the Attorney General. The three-Judge-Bench comprised Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice Sisira de Abrew and Justice Anil Goonaratne.
Additional Solicitor General Sanjay Rajaratnam appearing for the Attorney General had raised preliminary objections against a Fundamental Rights petition filed by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara for non-disclosure of material facts in the petition.
ASG Rajaratnam had informed Court that the Memorandum of Understandings (MOU) pertaining to the Hambantota harbour had been signed on three occasions in 2007, 2012 and 2014.
ASG Rajaratnam informed Court that these agreements had been signed with Chinese companies while the petitioner Vasudeva Nanayakkara was functioning as a Cabinet Minister and alleged that the petitioner has not disclosed the facts of the case.
The first and second phrases of the Hambantota project were signed in 2012 and 2014. This is a continuous and uninterrupted process from 2007. The petitioner has concealed these facts through his petition and he was a member of the Cabinet at the time the Cabinet Paper was presented, Rajaratnam had added.
He further informed Court that the final agreement between the Chinese companies and Government of Sri Lanka is yet to be finalised and thereby the petition cannot be maintained.
The Attorney General moved Court that the petitioner be dismissed for non-disclose of the material facts of the petition arguing that the petitioner does not have locus standi to invoke the Courts jurisdiction.
The petitioner cited members of the Cabinet of Ministers, members of the Cabinet Appointed Negotiating Committee (referred to as the CANC and also sometimes referred to as the Committee of Secretaries), the Director General of the Department of External Resources of the Ministry of National Polices and Economic Affairs, Sri Lanka Ports Authority, China Merchants Port Holdings Company Limited and China Communications Constructions Company as respondents.
The Petitioner states that this petition relates inter alia to the infringement and imminent infringement and continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed in terms of Article 12 (1) of the Constitution, by the arbitrary, capricious, mala fide and illegal and unlawful decision of the respondents to enter into an agreement with the Peoples Republic of China for the promotion of investment in Sri Lanka by Chinese investors and lease and convey and enter into an agreement or in any other manner dispose approximately 15,000 acres of land and/or 50 Square Kilometers.
The petitioner further sought a Declaration that the Framework Agreement dated 08.12.2016 as null and void, and declare that the said agreement has no force of law until the same is approved by Parliament, as required by Article 157 of the Constitution.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for the petitioner. Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva appeared for the Chinese companies.
Presidents Counsel Faiz Musthapha appeared for Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka.
ASG Sanjay Rajaratnam with DSG Nerin Pulle appeared for the Attorney General.

Govt trying to keep public opinion under carpet: Prof. Vitharana
The Government does not like to reveal the country what the people think about the Government by trying to postpone the Local Government election for another two or three years, LSSP Leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
Addressing the media at the LSSP Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the LG polls would be delayed for another two or three years if the percentage of members elected from wards is reduced from 70 percent to 60 percent proposed by the UNP, JVP, SLMC and a few other political parties. The delimitation process should be done again, he said.
According to Prof. Vitharana, dengue is raising its head in the country because there are no people's representatives in LG bodies to carry out dengue control activities. The Health Minister should provide equipment to test blood in hospitals to identify dengue patients, he said. Prof. Vitharana said funds should be allocated to the Disaster Management Ministry to provide homes for the victims of natural disasters.

Henry Blofeld brings a touch of the PG Wodehouse to TMS
It was fantastic to read and listen to so many wonderful tributes when my colleague Henry Blofeld announced he will be hanging up the Test Match Special microphone at the end of the summer.
What quickly became evident was the common theme at the heart of the warm words, stories and anecdotes: our Blowers is unique.
Special broadcasters like Henry cannot be created or coached - they just happen naturally.He is, as everyone knows, a larger than life character who helped to create a legacy that marks out TMS as the envy of the broadcast world - both from within and outside the sport.
Indeed, it was Henry who imparted some of the best advice I have ever received.
I bumped into him on the first morning of my first Test as the cricket correspondent of the BBC. His advice was simple: be yourself. Thats certainly what he is on air.
HE BROUGHT A PG WODEHOUSE FLAVOUR
Henry makes every ball sound like an event, describing it with such energy, vividness and a wonderful use of language. He also realises the importance of going beyond the narrow perspective of what is happening in the middle, bringing a PG Wodehouse flavour to proceedings.
I can always tell when Henry is getting excited about play because his right leg will bounce up and down like a piston. He brings pizzazz to the commentary box, where everyone has their role.
I know when Im sat alongside Henry that the colourful, eccentric and random side of things is taken care of.
He is one of a handful of people - the others being Brian Johnston, John Arlott, Christopher Martin-Jenkins, Fred Trueman, Trevor Bailey and Peter Baxter - who made TMS what it is today.
BLOWERS ITALIAN DRESS SENSE
Wherever I go, people always want to talk to me about Henry. People are just fascinated by him.And he has changed in some respects.
For example, he used to dress rather traditionally with a jacket and bow tie. You would never say he was necessarily smart - but always traditional.
Then he married an Italian lady called Valeria and all of a sudden, this radiant creature would turn up on the morning of the match wearing some shocking colours - yellow, purple, blue, green.
One thing which has never changed, however, is his insatiable appetite for his work - whether that is his theatre shows, writing books, public speaking or writing for newspapers. It is probably only now that he has finally taken a step back and looked at things.
THE CONSUMMATE PROFESSIONAL
I have so many fond memories of Henry.Back in 1998, a Test in Jamaica was abandoned because of a dangerous pitch. I knew I was going to be busy but I was absolutely desperate for the toilet.
There was one toilet in the whole commentary box and I burst into the room, only to be faced with Henry delivering an elaborate report over the phone to a radio station. I had no choice - I had to go to the toilet, despite Henry being in full flow.
Even when I pulled the chain, he did not break stride in his delivery. It was typical Henry. Being the extraordinary man that he is, he just carried on.
AND FINALLY...
I have to admit that we often liked to play childish tricks on Henry. I remember once sending him a fax from my laptop at the back of the commentary box. I ripped off the fax and handed it to Henry. On letter-headed paper for a carpet company which didnt exist I wrote something along the lines of: Dear Mr Blofeld, we think you are the best commentator on the radio, we always listen to you on the shop floor and if you mention us on air well send you a free carpet.
Henry enthusiastically read out the message and put the paper in his jacket pocket, delighted he was to get a new carpet no doubt. Half an hour later, I sent another fax from Smiths Carpets equally fictitious rival, Joness Carpets: Dear Mr Blofeld... we do not appreciate you blatantly plugging our rivals on air. Give us equal exposure or well be writing to the director general.
His face was a picture. And he never did get that free carpet.

I batted like Sangakkara and Jayasuriya, says Atapattu
Sri Lanka batter Chamari Atapattu has hogged the limelight in the early part of the ICC Womens World Cup 2017 like no one had imagined.
A dazzling 178 not out against defending champion Australia has overshadowed several fine performances and the left-hander believes she showed glimpses of her two batting heroes - Kumar Sangakkara and Sanath Jayasuriya, during the knock.
I started like Sanga and ended like Sanath, a beaming Atapattu said of her 143-ball knock in which she hit 22 fours and six sixes to help set a challenging 258-run target for Australia.
Atapattu has been around for long and even considered as Sri Lankas batting mainstay by many, but to see her come out with such gusto against the worlds top side was a big surprise.
Hailing from Gokarella in central Sri Lanka, Atapattu had to take over captaincy at the ICC Womens World Twenty20 2016 after Shashikala Siriwardene was ruled out of the tournament with a hamstring injury. That was a learning curve for the former captain as she learned to cope with pressure.
The 27-year-old, who has scored 1906 runs in 61 ODIs and 1001 runs in 58 T20Is, is delighted with how things have panned out and elated at her latest effort.
I am really happy with my performance. For the first 25-30 overs, I tried to go for singles and the odd boundary. After 35 overs, when the Power Play started, I tried to hit the ball over the ropes, she said, giving credit to coaches Hemantha Devapriya and Jeevanta Kulatunga for her development as a batter.
Atapattu made her international debut against India during the ICC World Twenty20 2009 in Taunton, not far from where she caught the attention of the entire cricketing world on Thursday with the second-highest score in all World Cup matches.
After top-scoring with 53 in her teams tournament opener against New Zealand, Atapattu produced the scintillating knock that will be remembered for long despite her team losing to Australia by eight wickets. I love coming back to England, she said. I love the conditions here and we have played a game here before so I knew what the conditions would be like.
Her 178 not out will go alongside her centuries against Ireland and South Africa but Atapattu rates the stunning knock in Bristol as her finest accomplishment to date.
This is my best achievement. Australia has experienced bowlers like Ellyse Perry and Megan Schutt, who also play in leagues and county matches. I trusted myself and played to my potential.
Atapattu was encouraged by her father and inspired by cricketing icons Jayasuriya and Sangakkara, who was quick to laud her on twitter after the Bristol knock.
Atapattu though has dedicated her latest knock to her cricket-crazy father, who passed 10 years ago with a cardiac arrest when she was only 17.
He is the hero in my life. He helped me a lot in my career. He loved cricket. He always pushed me to go and play, supported me in all aspects.
I liked cricket, but was very lazy. He pushed me to pursue a career in the game.
Her mother, who retired as a nurse following her fathers death, encouraged the batter to continue playing despite the bereavement. Just two years on, Atapattu would make her international debut.
Atapattu, who likes to travel and mountaineering in her spare time, started slowly in Bristol, ticking things along before exploding in the final 15 overs.
Already a big name in her home town, Atapattu wants to help womens cricket grow in Sri Lanka.
A lot of girls are now playing cricket in my town, a few youngsters have come to the national level. We need more girls to play to help improve our cricket. In the next year we will see two or three players come through to play in the national team.

"The Lanka Sama Samaja Party (LSSP) is against doctors' strikes. They should not strike putting poor patients' lives in danger. Instead, they should protest against the SAITM by supporting the struggle of the university students," LSSP leader Prof. Tissa Vitharana said.
He was addressing a press conference at the LSSP Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday. Prof. Vitharana said the SAITM should be regulated through the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). "It was the SLMC that should take decision on the SAITM, not the judiciary. A `Special Minister' cannot take technical decisions on behalf of the SLMC, he said. He said the Medical Faculty and the SAITM should be taken over by the government. Otherwise, it should function as a non-profit institution. "It is the same in other countries when it comes to private medical faculties," he said.
"If the SAITM becomes a non-profit service institution, it should offer 30 percent of scholarships for poor medical students with three A/L A passes.
The government can produce doctors required for the country without private sector participation," he said.

Madu-Patron of KSC
Dharmasiri Madugalle, the oldest living Kandy Sports Club ruggerite and captain deserves the honour bestowed on him by being made Patron. He was named Patron for 2017-18 at the AGM held recently.
Madu was a fine ruggerite to come out of Trinity College from 1950 and led the school team in 1953. Under his leadership Trinity won the Bradby Shield 13-0 and 3-0.
He was a good athlete and had the privilege of leading both the rugger and the athletic teams at Trinity in 1952 and 1953. He was a fine wing-three-quarter and played for Kandy SC as a schoolboy in 1953 and went on till 1961.
He was in the Kandy SCs first cup final team in 1954 and the following year 1955.
He was a member of the Sri Lanka team from 1955 to 1965. In 1964 he led Kandy SC and in 1966 he led Up-Country.
He was in the first all Ceylon team which took part in the All Indian tournament.
He became the first Kandy SC captain to hold the President and Patrons posts. As a president he executed his duties well because he had played the game at the highest level and he knew how to promote the game.
People of his caliber are sadly missing at the club today.
4500 girls and boys were in action
Around 4500 girls and boys were in action at the Central Province Schools Athletic Championships, which was organized under the direction of chief minister Sarath Ekanayake who is also the education minister.
The meet was organized by the Central Education Department. A big hand should go to Director of Education E.P.T.K. Ekanayake, Zonal director W.M. Wijeratne, and Sports Director Athula Jayewardene for a good job done. This four day meet was held at the Bogambara Stadium. In the girls section A.Ratnayake Central College was placed first for the 25th consecutive year. They collected 396 points.
Second place went to Ambagamuwa Central from Hatton with 106 points. Swarnamali Balika Kandy was third with 98 points.
In the Boys too it was A. Ratnayake Central College Walla who was first for the 20th time with 253 points, Trinity College was second with 187 points and St. Sylvesters College third with 91 points.

Sean coach, Saliya assistant and Kapila manager
Once again Sean Wijesinghe coach, Saliya Kumara assistant and Kapila Silva manager will officiate in their capacity for Kandy SC in the forthcoming season.
They might just be the most valuable resource we have in our game right now. They will have the fullest backing from the rugby chairman Lasantha Wijesuriya who is also the vice president and the kingmaker of the game Malik Samarawickrema both know what rugby is all about and its promotion.
Today this club committee is with more members who have not played the game but they can cheer and clap and inspire the team. Wijesinghe learnt his rugby at Trinity, Kumara at Vidyartha College and later at Trinity and Kapila Silva at Isipathana College.
Kandy SC to call for SGM to correct accounts
It is alleged by some members that at the last Kandy SC committee headed by N. Ratwate failed to present the accounts correctly, and one of the senior persons in the rugby circle Tuan Dole pointed out this shortcoming.
Now they have to face an SGM. Sad to say all this is because of poor management. Fans are querying whether Kandy SCs golden run is about to end with inefficient members around. Today management wise it is apparently in a mess.
Kandys Ransilu sets Asian record
A product of Kingswood College Ransilu Jayatilaka made Kandy proud by setting a new Asian record. He finished 5th in the 120kg category and in the dead lift was able to lift 315 kg.

Dharmaraja under 17 cricket
Dharmaraja College have won all 7 first round matches in Division One against St Anthonys, Katugastota, St Sylvesters, St Thomas Matale, Sri Sumangala, Kandy, Kegalu Vidyalaya, Sri Rahula, and Vidyartha. In the next round they have to play with Trinity, Mahinda and St. Peters. Senaka Dissanayake is the coach.
Schools badly affected at rugby
Schools are to make a request to bring down the ground fee at Nittawela. For a match they have to pay Rs. 70,000, then for practices Rs. 8000 and only 30 players can practice. This is the property of the KMC, which is on lease from 1950s and renewed every five years for a few thousand rupees. In the good old days it was mentioned in the agreement that the grounds should be given to the village sportsman and also for schools for sports.
Today it is for big money and schools cant afford it.
Schools rugby 7s today
Today will be the first day of the schools rugby 7s. St. Anthonys, Vidyartha, Kingswood, Trinity, Dharmaraja, Sri Sumangala and St. Sylvesters are expected to play well. St. Anthonys won the division one and Sri Rahula division two plate championships in the league. The competition will have 31 teams, divided into eight groups ranging from A to H. The top performer in each group will be promoted to the Cup segment while the 2nd, 3rd and 4th will play in the Plate, Bowl and Shield.

Media has broad role in countrys forward march - President
President Maithripala Sirisena said that media should play a responsible role instead of arousing people through negative news.
The President added that media is duty bound to be the driving force of the country towards prosperity to make a better future.
The President made these remarks addressing a gathering at the Ratnapaura Hospital yesterday. A Paediatric Unit, a blood bank and a dialysis unit were commissioned by the President constructed at a cost of Rs 100 million.
President Sirisena stressed that the media should act in a responsible and acceptable manner while following media ethics and norms, so as to cultivate a positive attitude among people.
Even though it is regrettable to mention that Sri Lankan media has not clearly understood the duty expected of them.
The quality and responsible conduct of media are vital for the country to stand on its own feet as a developed country. Therefore, the media should clearly understand their role and responsibilities, he said.
It is observed that certain sections of the Sri Lankan media is interested in digging garbage and very keen to report negative news such as murders, rape cases, disputes and communal issues.The media has to play a broad role in the countrys forward march by building a strong media culture. The media is duty bound to inculcate good and noble qualities in people such as patriotism, social responsibilities, social-harmony, personnel and social responsibilities rather than arousing hatred, communalism and racism.
People may think that there is no Government in the country when watching and listening to media. They may wonder what happens to the country by the following day. That is because the way the media behave, the President added.
The President pointed out that media is so powerful and strong enough to drive a country forward and towards a strong goal.
Speaking on the dengue menus, the President said that everyone has a bounding duty for eradicate dengue.
The dedication and devotion of every person is needed for eradicate the dengue menace. It can be observed that dengue is directly linked with personal discipline and other good qualities such as obedience to law and order, the President said.
President Sirisena noted that the flood control system, which was introduced in 1968 by a team of American experts, will be implemented soon aiming to protect the people of the Ratnapura and Kalutara districts from floods.

Navy upgrades Disaster Response Capabilities
A Disaster Response Unit was opened at SLNS Gemunu, Welisara by Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra C. Wijegunaratne.
The Navy Commander addressing the officers and sailors said, "At present we do not have a visible enemy like the LTTE we had before 2009. But, today we face yet another enemy that comes in the form of natural disasters and it is our prime duty to save the public from natural disasters like floods, landslide, etc. In doing so, we have to be prepared to meet the highest professional level."
He further stated that this unit would be able to swiftly respond to natural disasters especially in the Western and Southern areas. The DRU comprises Fibreglass Dinghy (FGDs) boats, Rubber Floatable Dinghies (RFDs), Outboard Motor (OBMs) engines, state of the art mobile kitchens, made using containers, all cooking utensils, tents, water pumps, high pressure water guns, and mobile toilets, among a host of other equipment that are essential for naval personnel to act as first responders during a disaster. He also mentioned that another two units of this nature would be established in the North Central and Eastern Areas where the community is battered by flash floods as a result of monsoonal rains.
This unit comes as a very important initiative by the Navy, and will be of immense value during the launching of Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief Operations, commonly referred to by military personnel as HA/DR operations. Especially during times of floods, the naval personnel have a major role to play as first responders, since access to inundated areas will be primarily by small FGDs and RFDs.
The Navy recently held a parade at the Colombo Port Eastern Container Terminal pier, in the presence of the Navy Commander to felicitate all those who actively participated in rescuing civilians in the aftermath of the recent severe weather.
Vice Admiral Wijegunaratne highlighted the role played by naval personnel and added, "as armed personnel who depend completely upon public money, we have a paramount responsibility in delivering our noble service at any cost for the protection of them."
All naval personnel who were involved in the flood relief operations, including the RABS, SBS, Navy Marines, Divers, Medical, Engineering and Supply components were rewarded at the function.
Natural disasters cannot be prevented, but we can avert a much bigger calamity if we are geared to encounter that.
This is an area where the preparedness and response will have a bigger role to play. At certain times, prompt reaction will not be good enough to mitigate the magnitude of the damage caused by natural disasters, unless you have necessary resources, men, and highly integrated follow up plans.
In this context, the responsibility of the Navy is of large dimension, as it is one of the front line forces to be engaged in disaster response missions with its men and resources.

NPC stirs up again over appointment of two ministers
A group of Northern Provincial Councillors who had submitted a No Confidence Motion against Northern Province Chief Minister C.V. Wigneswaran, are preparing to hold a secret meeting to discuss the appointment of two provincial ministers.
These two provincial ministers were appointed by the Chief Minister on Thursday.
Sources from the Northern Provincial Council said the appointment of the two new ministers had become a problem since two names had been proposed for the post of Education Minister by two different groups of council members .
Reports said, members of the Illangai Thamil Arusakachchi (ITAK) group which submitted the no confidence motion against the Chief Minister, had proposed the name of Emmanuel Arnold for the post of Education Minister, while the group of 15 members who opposed the no confidence motion had proposed the name of Kandiah Sarveshan for the post.
Meanwhile, this group had got the name of Sarveshan certified for the Education Minister post during their discussion with the Chief Minister.
But, since the ITAK members have opposed this name, analysts predict that these provincial ministers could face opposition in the future.

Showbiz stars gather for Messis wedding
Rosario,Friday: Football and showbiz stars gathered in Argentina for Latin Americas celebrity wedding bash of the decade as Barcelona superstar Lionel Messi prepared to marry his childhood sweetheart Antonella Roccuzzo on Friday.
Pop star Shakira and her husband, Messis teammate Gerard Pique, were expected among the 260 guests, according to media and locals close to the event.
They will join old friends of the couple and footballers, including his Barcelona strike partners Neymar and Luis Suarez, in Messis northern hometown, Rosario.Suarez and other soccer stars were watched by curious locals as they stepped off private jets on Thursday at Rosarios airport.
The party will be a respite for Messi from his legal woes. A Spanish court last month rejected his appeal against a conviction for tax fraud.
Brunette bride Roccuzzo, 29, will wear a dress by Rosa Clara -- a Spanish designer who has dressed actress Eva Longoria and Spains Queen Letizia.
From 2200 GMT the guests will pack into the Hotel City-Center Casino, which stands right next to a crime-ridden slum run by drug gangs.This city of 1.2 million people is also a cradle of footballing talent, however.
Rosario lives and breathes football. That is another reason Lionel feels so comfortable here, the citys mayor, Monica Fein, told AFP.
I think he is excited that through his wedding his friends (from abroad) will be able to get to know the city he loves so much.
The civil wedding ceremony and party will all take place inside the venue, and the guests will be lodged there too. -AFP

Spinners Harmer and Qadri shine in day/night county matches
LONDON, Thursday  South African Simon Harmer took nine wickets as Essex beat Middlesex on Thursday while Afghan teenager and fellow spinner Hamidullah Qadri had a debut to remember as his second-innings five-wicket haul led Derbyshire to their first County Championship victory for two years.
Harmer took nine for 95 as Essex beat Middlesex by an innings and 34 runs to extend their lead at the top od the First Division table to 29 points on the final day of the inaugural round of day-night fixtures.
Middlesex appeared to be heading for a draw at Chelmsford with former England batsman Nick Compton making 120 and putting on 153 with Ireland's Paul Stirling.
But Harmer removed Stirling to spark a collapse that saw Middlesex lose their last seven wickets for just 58 runs to be dismissed for 262 under the lights.
Harmer removed Steven Finn in the penultimate over to complete Essex's victory and take his wicket tally to 28 for 300 runs in the last two matches.
In the Second Division, Qadri, born in Kandahar, had a stunning debut.
The 16-year-old, the youngest player to feature for Derbyshire in the Championship, took five for 60 from 26.3 overs to skittle out hosts Glamorgan for 172 as the Midlands side secured a 39-run win in Cardiff.
The first county cricketer to have been born in the 21st Century, Qadri's haul saw Derbyshire complete their first Championship victory for 710 days.

Sri Lanka, India to set up solar unit
Sri Lanka will soon kick-start the process of setting up a solar power plant in eastern port town Trincomalee after discussions with India, which is partnering the Government in the initiative.
The next step would be to undertake a feasibility study and do the groundwork, spokesman of the Ministry of Power and Renewable Energy Sulakshana Jayawardena told The Hindu on Wednesday.
In April this year, the governments of Sri Lanka and India signed a Memorandum of Understanding, for cooperation in a host of development projects including the setting up of a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) plant in suburban Colombo and a solar power plant in Sampur, Trincomalee.
We have the required land to set up the 50 MW solar plant envisaged in the MoU. We have to now work out the process of executing the project, in consultation with India, Mr. Jayawardena said.
NTPC venture
Sri Lanka had initially planned to set up a coal power plant in Sampur, through an international joint venture with Indias National Thermal Power Corporation. However, in September 2016 the Power Ministry scrapped the project citing environmental concerns.
A month later, Prime Minister Narendra Modi met President Maithripala Sirisena in Goa, on the side-lines of the BRICS summit, where he flagged the possibility of New Delhi partnering Colombo in LNG and green energy projects. The Hindu News

It is supposed to be a countervailing body to the NATO Alliance. It covers a geographical span of the Earth in which over 50 percent of the worlds people live. Now India, China and Russia  three powerful players in international politics are its members. Iran, a formidable power in West Asia has applied for its membership and it is most likely the application would be considered favourably at its next Summit.
Pakistan Prime Minister addressing the Summit said that the SCO is a sheet anchor for regional stability. It is also a link between the Asia-Pacific, East Asia, West Asia and the Atlantic, he said. According to commentators the admission of India and Pakistan has enhanced the political dimension of the SCO. However, it has also the possibility of Indo-Pakistan tensions paralyzing its smooth progress. It will need a huge diplomatic effort to maintain and develop the sound relations between its members. The possibility of mature Russian and Chinese diplomacy influencing a rapprochement between the two South Asian giants also cannot be ruled out in the long term.
On the sidelines of the Summit Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi met Chinese President Xi Jinping and Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif.
Among the documents approved at the Summit are a Convention on combatting Extremism and a Joint Statement on counter-measures against terrorism. Sri Lanka and Turkey are Dialogue Partners of the SCO, a position confirming the similarity of objectives of the former with that of the latter.
Indo-US relations get cozier
The visit of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi to the United States and his official talks with President Donald Trump has made Indo-US relations cozier. The visit, which was his fifth after assuming office ended on a high note. President Trump called his meeting with Modi a tremendous success. According to Premier Modi the visit has consolidated a robust strategic partnership. He claims that the United States is the primary partner for Indias transformation.
A discernible shift in the Indian position is the overt support it has expressed to the belligerent policy of President Trump towards North Korea. By endorsing economic sanctions against North Korea and having imposed sanctions herself India has become a strong ally of the United States on the Korean issue. No doubt it has in mind the sympathetic attitude of China towards North Korea. The reference to the need to respect the sovereignty of nations and international law contained in the Indo-US joint statement is obviously a remark against the One Belt One Road initiative and the China- Pakistan Economic Corridor which runs through Pakistan controlled Kashmir.
India is also pleased with the United States designating Hizbul Mujahideen leader Syed Salahuddin as a Global Terrorist. The Joint Statement also refers to the need to combat cross-border terrorism which refers to militant groups based in Pakistan.
The visit has also consolidated and strengthened Indo-US defense co-operation. While India has promised to buy US Defense products the United States has pledged to supply unmanned drones and Naval Aerial Defense systems to India. Joint Naval exercises comprising Indian, American and Japanese navies are expected to be held soon.
Pakistan has already criticized the outcome of Modis visit to the US as a security threat that it would even encourage India to engage in military adventures. It is also unhappy about reference to cross border terrorism and the supply of sophisticated military equipment to India by the United States.
While reliance on the United States would ensure a stable climate for its own economic development over-dependence on the US would have a negative effect on its ability to be a stabilizing power in the Asia-Pacific zone, particularly in East Asia.

Test status a precarious prize for Ireland
Mission accomplished! Bravo for Cricket Ireland and especially its dogged chief executive Warren Deutrom.
Test status was Irelands destiny - a long battle, fought on the field and in the boardrooms of world cricket that would be waged until victory was assured.
Test cricket is the pinnacle of the sport and its what weve all been aiming for, said a delighted Deutrom after Ireland and Afghanistan were awarded Full Membership by the ICC on Thursday.
We are striving to make Ireland not only a major nation in cricket, but also to make cricket a major mainstream sport in the country.
The sport has grown substantially since 2007, with participation levels quadrupling in that time. We see this not as the end of the road, but just the first step in taking our wonderful sport further and higher in the years ahead.
The allure of Test cricket saw Ed Joyce, Boyd Rankin and Eoin Morgan switch allegiance to England. Irelands best young players can now experience five-day cricket on home soil.
Its a time of celebration but once the fizz has gone out of the champagne a huge challenge awaits.
Rivalling the big beasts of football, GAA and rugby in the Irish sporting landscape is a massive ask for a sport which rarely features on the back pages.
Cricket is indeed a growth sport but pushing on to the next level will require success in the Test arena to inspire the young to pick up a bat and ball.Gaining that success will be the toughest task - just ask Bangladesh.
A cricket-mad nation with a population of 161 million, it was awarded Test status in 2000 and the Tigers suffered over a decade of humiliating defeats before being able to compete with the best.
Ireland has to make the best from 6.5 million citizens and after a long period of improvement an ageing team is beginning to struggle on the international stage.
The addition of Ireland and Afghanistan brings the number of Test teams up to 12 and a two-tier league format has been mooted to make games more competitive.This would be a positive move for Ireland, allowing them to find their feet in Test cricket, going into matches with a realistic chance of winning. An additional one-off Test against a side preparing for a series in England could add a much-need glamour game to the calendar.
The words cricket and Ireland do not sit easily together and the reason lies in the skies above.
In this part of the world five straight days without rain is considered to be something approaching drought conditions.
It ensures we live in a green, lush land but precipitation is the mortal enemy of cricket and its likely to be the bane of many a Test in Ireland.
Theres also the decline, with the exception of England, of Test cricket as a spectacle with only the shorter forms of the game filling stadiums.
So it will be a tough sell for Cricket Ireland and the hard work starts now. We now have first-class cricket in the form of the Inter-Provincial Series and it must produce Test-calibre players for the masterplan to succeed.
It all adds up to this being a risky venture but surely a worthwhile one, for cricket in Ireland would suffer stagnation if this natural progression was blocked.
We are in it for the long haul, it will require patience and thoughts of instant success should be dispelled.
A week down in beautiful Malahide to watch the Boys in Green (or should I say white) knock it about under a warm summer sun - it doesnt get much better than that.

## Title: Theres no space for Qatar to save face

Theres no space for Qatar to save face
Last week, Saudi Arabia and its allies outlined their list of demands that Qatar would need to fulfill in order to end the worst crisis in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) since its establishment in 1981. The 13 demands, confirmed by multiple Gulf media outlets and by foreign ministry officials from the United Arab Emirates and Qatar, are too sweeping for Qatar to accept without a 180-degree change in its foreign policy.
Nor is the anti-Qatar quartet  namely Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain, and Egypt  necessarily expecting a quick compromise that resolves the crisis. Rather, they appear to be digging in for an extended conflict with their Gulf neighbour. Their demands included requirements that Doha pay compensation to them for any losses incurred due to Qatari foreign policy and to completely shut down Al Jazeera  extreme steps that suggest the four countries are not interested in negotiation at this point.
Even if the five countries reach a settlement, the wounds caused during the row are too deep to heal in the coming years. Asked whether this meant the end of the GCC, a senior Gulf official replied: Yes. Unless Qatar complies with the demands 100 percent.
The roots of the quarrel can be traced to the 1995 coup in Doha, which saw the rise of Sheikh Hamad bin Khalifa Al Thani. Sheikh Hamad ousted his father, whom he regarded as a puppet to the Saudis, and pursued an independent policy that broke away from his countrys larger neighbour, as Qatar began to use its abundance of gas to modernize the country and expand its influence regionally and internationally. Saudi Arabia unsuccessfully backed a comeback attempt by the ousted emir the following year, and the relationship went downhill from there.
The Egypt factor
From a Qatari perspective, Doha seeks to retain an independent policy that does not necessarily impinge on the interests of its neighbours but is also not linked at the hip with the GCC. Qatar also says its threshold for what it considers extremism differs from those of Riyadh and Abu Dhabi, most notably with regards to groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and the Syrian organisation Ahrar al-Sham. Saudi Arabia and the UAE counter that Qatar has deliberately supported individuals, groups, and media outlets that directly threaten the security and stability of their societies. They cite Oman as a counterexample of a GCC country with an independent policy, which includes close ties with Iran, but one that does not threaten their stability. To them, the issue relates to Qatars destabilizing approach in a volatile region.
The current crisis intensified with the Arab uprisings in 2011, when Doha invested in Islamists and political activists across the region, and was triggered by events in the summer of 2013. Just three days after Sheikh Hamad abdicated on June 25 that year, protests erupted in Egypt calling for the ouster of Mohamed Morsi, the Qatar-supported and Muslim Brotherhood-aligned president. Morsi was replaced by Field Marshal Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, a close ally of the UAE and Saudi Arabia who emerged as a military dictator hostile to the Qataris. However, tensions with Qatar were largely contained due to the perception at the time that the new Qatari emir, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani  then just 33 years old  was inward-looking, a friend of the Saudi royal court, and would pursue a conciliatory approach with his neighbours.
Pressure mounted on the new emir to reverse Qatari foreign policies. In March 2014, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, and Bahrain announced the withdrawal of their ambassadors, in a rare public move designed to put pressure on Doha.
The move was a sign that the tension between the two sides had reached a boiling point.
In an exclusive article published after the envoys withdrawal, Foreign Policy was first to report on the content of the agreement signed in Riyadh in 2014 to defuse the conflict. The terms involved demanding that Qatar rein in hostile media outlets inside and outside Doha; expel Muslim Brotherhood members, particularly those from Gulf countries; stop naturalizing Gulf activists; and halt any support to groups such as the Muslim Brotherhood and Yemens Houthis.
Doha denied funding the Houthis, and sources close to the government in Doha say Qatar never admitted to doing the things its Gulf neighbours accused it of  but agreed to take steps to reassure them and bring an end to the conflict. The list published on Thursday echoed the 2014 demands, with new additions. The new list, unlike the old one, includes the shutdown of Al Jazeera  not just affiliated media outlets that specifically targeted the Gulf States. The demands also specified six other media outlets  some of which are linked to the Egyptian Muslim Brotherhood, like Mekameleen TV  that must be shuttered.
Impossible demands
The quartets demands also include the need for Qatar to significantly scale down its relationship with Iran. Saudi Arabia and its allies are calling on Doha to downgrade its diplomatic representation in Tehran, expel members of Irans Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC), and sever any military and intelligence cooperation. Instead, the Qatari-Iranian relationship must be limited to commercial ties that are also compliant with international and Gulf sanctions imposed on Iran. The two countries share an enormous natural gas field, discovered in the 1970s.
Qatar is also required to halt military cooperation with Turkey  including the establishment of a Turkish military base on Qatari soil. Two days after the Saudi camp announced the blockade against Qatar, the Turkish parliament approved the deployment of 5,000 troops to Qatar. Despite reassurance from Turkey that the move was discussed prior to the crisis, Riyadh and Abu Dhabi saw the move as a challenge to the quartets position. A Gulf official told FP that he expects the Turkish involvement will further increase friction between Ankara and Riyadh.
The list also stipulates that Doha must relinquish any relationship with extremist groups, specifically the Muslim Brotherhood, the Islamic State, al Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham (formerly the Nusra Front, al Qaedas Syria franchise), and Hezbollah.

Udayangas passports impounded
The Colombo Fort Magistrate yesterday, ordered to impound two passports belonging to former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga in the magisterial inquiry pertaining to the controversial MiG aircraft transaction.
Accordingly, a diplomatic passport bearing number D 3643585 and a general passport bearing number N 5400885 issued by the Sri Lankan government to Udayanga Weeratunga were ordered to be impounded by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne in accordance with Section 124 of the Criminal Procedure Code and Section 51 C of the Immigrants and Emigrants Act.
The FCID conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction informed Court that they have sought the assistance of Interpol to trace former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in UAE and further said he has visited multiple countries including Japan using passports issued by Sri Lankan government.
FCID Chief Inspector Nihal Francis made request to impound two passports belonging to Udayanga Weeratunga as it may deem necessary to procure the attendance of the accused.
We have recorded a statement from Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando about a meeting with Udayanga Weeratunga in Japan.
Deputy Minister Arundika Fernando had admitted to having met with Udayanga Weeratunga in Japan, Chief Inspector added.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had earlier issued a warrant through the Interpol for the arrest of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID conducting investigations into the MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016. The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack craft for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who has been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Udayanga Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack craft. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million. On June 9, 2016, the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up.The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were allegedly earned through the Mig-27 transaction. The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.

Uma Oya project estimate bloated: CaFFE Executive Director
The Uma Oya project estimate was bloated by USD 248 million in January 2009 with the intention of receiving commissions, CaFFE Executive Director Keethi Thennakoon said.
Issuing a press release yesterday, he said former Irrigation Ministry Secretary A.D.S.Gunawardena resigned from his post on January 9,2009 noting his reluctance to sign the project agreement that costs an additional sum of USD 248 million to the Sri Lankan Government.
There was political pressure on him to sign the project agreement. As he resigned, his successor Ivan Silva started the project despite the vehement opposition by the environmentalists and people in Uva. By that time, the project estimate had risen to about four folds of the original estimate prepared in 2008 by a Canadian company, he said.
Corrupt politicians and public officials should take the blame for the current plight of Bandarawela which was a beautiful town several years ago, he said.

UNDP, Ministry come together to further develop Idea Board
The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) today entered into a partnership with the Science, Technology and Research Ministry to further develop and co-fund the Idea Board, an online crowd sourcing platform anchored at the Sri Lanka Innovation Dashboard, an initiative by the Ministry.
A collective effort between the UNDP and the Ministry, the Idea Board, was developed by a group of young developers brought together by the UNDP. The concept behind an online crowd sourcing platform is to create a space for communities, including young people from across the country, to voice their opinions and thoughts, after which they will be consolidated into a larger effort to create solutions for social issues ailing the country.
Through the Idea Board, the Ministry and the UNDP will be able to identify ideas that could be expanded into solutions; making this platform an effective bottom-to-top approach in finding solutions to development challenges faced by communities.
With the interest of expanding the reach, the UNDP and the Ministry have now come together to co-fund the second phase of the Idea Board. It will see further developments made to the platform to make it more dynamic and user-friendly to attract more users.
The Ministry Secretary Udaya Seneviratne said the Ministry through the Coordinating Secretariat for Science, Technology and Innovation (COSTI) is pleased to partner with the UNDP to develop the Idea Board. The platform aims to give the general public a space to voice their opinions, ideas and solutions.
UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director Jorn Sorensen said that they are very pleased to continue their partnership with the Science,
Technology and Research Ministry to further develop the Idea Board platform.

Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) partymen are disenchanted with the police in the district after they were reportedly denied permission on Wednesday to meet Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in the settlement in Bhavani Sagar.
Party functionaries led by its State deputy general secretary Vanniarasu had been to meet the refugees who had represented to VCK leader Thol Thirumavalavan that they were hounded by functionaries of mainstream political parties when the team was not only denied permission, but also detained for about an hour.
Irked by unfair treatment at a local sports event, unidentified people in the refugee camp had torn posters of some politicians, triggering demand from the political parties for shifting of the refugee camp out of Bhavani Sagar. The VCK only intended to interact with the refugees to know the facts, said zonal organising secretary of VCK, Vinayagamoorthy.
There was no rule as such that the people in refugee camp must be kept in isolation.
No such situation prevails in the refugee camps in other districts, Vinayagamoorthy said. The Hindu

Venus Williams at fault in fatal car crash in Florida - police
US tennis star Venus Williams has been involved in a car crash that led to the death of a 78-year-old man.
A spokesman for Palm Beach Gardens police in Florida confirmed to the BBC they were investigating a fatal crash involving the Grand Slam champion.
A man was taken to hospital after the accident on 9 June and died two weeks later from his injuries, he said.
Police believe she was at fault but her lawyer says it was an accident. She has not been cited or charged.
The man who died, Jerome Barson, was travelling with his wife who was driving their vehicle through an intersection when the collision happened.
Ms Williams car suddenly darted into their path and was unable to clear the junction in time due to traffic jams, according to witness statements in a police report obtained by US media.
Mrs Barson was also taken to hospital but survived.
[Ms Williams] is at fault for violating the right of way of [the other driver], the report said, adding that there were no other factors like drugs, alcohol or mobile phone distractions.
The 37-year-old, seven-time Grand Slam champion reportedly told police she did not see the couples car and she was driving slowly.
Ms Williams lawyer Malcolm Cunningham told CNN in a statement: Ms Williams entered the intersection on a green light. The police report estimates that Ms Williams was travelling at 5mph when Mrs Barson crashed into her.
Authorities did not issue Ms Williams with any citations or traffic violations. This is an unfortunate accident and Venus expresses her deepest condolences to the family who lost a loved one.
Next week, Ms Williams is due to play her 20th Wimbledon tournament in London, where she is seeded 10th.
Ms Williams and her sister Serena have dominated the womens game for two decades. -BBC

Whither anti-SAITM protests
But an appraisal of a provisional revolutionary government's significance would be incomplete and wrong if the class nature of the democratic revolution were lost sight of. The resolution therefore adds that a revolution will strengthen the rule of the bourgeoisie. This is inevitable under the present, capitalist, social and economic system. And the strengthening of the bourgeoisie's rule over the proletariat that has secured some measure of political liberty must inevitably lead to a desperate struggle between them for power, must lead to desperate attempts on the part of the bourgeoisie to take away from the proletariat the gains of the revolutionary period. Therefore the proletariat, which is in the vanguard of the struggle for democracy and heads that struggle, must not for a single moment forget the new antagonisms inherent in bourgeois democracy, or the new struggle.
This is what Lenin said about a democratic revolution that was in the agenda in Russia in 1905. Workers should be very conscious of the democracy they get in the course of the struggle. However in the past period in developing countries, so called socialists spread the idea that workers and oppressed youth should fight for socialism even at the expense of democracy.
These Neanderthal socialists were for an extreme dictatorial regime in the name of socialism. Lenin's arguments given above on his views about the transition from a repressive, authoritarian regime to a more democratic dispensation in Russia show clearly the importance of democracy for the emancipation of worker.
But both in '71 and '88 we saw youth in this country fighting under extreme dictatorial organisations for mythical liberation and socialism. Clearly this kind of liberation does not flow from the teachings of Marx, Engels or Lenin. These ideas are related to populist socialists who believed in resurrection of Asiatic mode of production in this era of modernism. Marx explained that in India and other Asiatic countries, before European intervened, Asiatic commune system prevailed.
In those of the simplest form, the land is tilled in common, and the produce divided among the members. At the same time, spinning and weaving are carried on in each family as subsidiary industries.
Asiatic societies
Side by side with the masses thus occupied with one and the same work, we find the chief inhabitant, who is judge, police, and tax-gatherer in one; the book-keeper, who keeps the accounts of the tillage and registers everything relating thereto; another official, who prosecutes criminals, protects strangers travelling through and escorts them to the next village; the boundary man, who guards the boundaries against neighbouring communities; the water-overseer, who distributes the water from the common tanks for irrigation; the Brahmin, who conducts the religious services; the schoolmaster, who on the sand teaches the children reading and writing; the calendar-Brahmin, or astrologer, who makes known the lucky or unlucky days for seed-time and harvest, and for every other kind of agricultural work; a smith and a carpenter, who make and repair all the agricultural implements; the potter, who makes all the pottery of the village; the barber, the washer man, who washes clothes, the silversmith, here and there the poet, who in some communities replaces the silversmith, in others the schoolmaster.
This dozen of individuals is maintained at the expense of the whole community. If the population increases, a new community is founded, on the pattern of the old one, on unoccupied land. The whole mechanism discloses a systematic division of labour; but a division like that in manufactures is impossible, since the smith and the carpenter, &c., find an unchanging market, and at the most there occur, according to the sizes of the villages, two or three of each, instead of one.
The law that regulates the division of labour in the community acts with the irresistible authority of a law of Nature, at the same time that each individual artificer, the smith, the carpenter, and so on, conducts in his workshop all the operations of his handicraft in the traditional way, but independently, and without recognizing any authority over him.
The simplicity of the organisation for production in these self-sufficing communities that constantly reproduce themselves in the same form, and when accidentally destroyed, spring up again on the spot and with the same name this simplicity supplies the key to the secret of the unchangeableness of Asiatic societies, an unchangeableness in such striking contrast with the constant dissolution and refounding of Asiatic States, and the never-ceasing changes of dynasty. The structure of the economic elements of society remains untouched by the storm-clouds of the political sky.
Healthcare services countrywide came to standstill recently as a result of the work stoppage by the members of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) over the SAITM issue. The logic of this action and the ethical standing of the GMOA leadership revealed from their statements show strong affiliating to Asiatic populist politics. GMOA Assistant Secretary Nalinda Herath told a news conference that they would not stop their trade union action until the government accedes to their demands on the SAITM issue.
Actually SAITM issue is created by the IUSF and GMOA came in support of student struggle. Attack on students attracted sympathy of the general public though many complained about blocking the roads and traffic created. GMOA wanted SAITM issue to be in the fore front.
This strike will only be successful when we win this battle. Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said the government will take tough action against the striking doctors. We will be forced to toughen our stance if he does so, said, Dr Herath.
At the same time, GMOA Media Spokesman Samantha Ananda said the final phase of the battle against SAITM has now arrived and that the government should resolve this matter without further delay.
Civil organisations
He said they had made five suggestions which the government could easily implement in resolving this matter. According to their suggestions, the Health Minister should gazette the minimum standards of medical education and the Higher Education Minister should inform the courts that SAITM does not have the compliance certificate given by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC). The government should stop SAITM from enrolling new students, Dr. Ananda said.
However, the GMOA position at that stage was, it would continue the countrywide strike until the government addressed their demands on SAITM.
Later GMOA called off the strike after discussions with the President. Apparently President has assured that all their demands will be carried out. May be so! On the other hand strike was not acceptable to the people. Striking doctors expected the suffering of patients, physical depreciation and death will agitate family members and friends, and that in turn will push public against the government. In general, such was the repercussion in the past.
But this time people were aware of the contradictory nature of the SAITM issue. If the demand is to develop SAITM and satisfy the standard expected by the Medical Council then all will agree. But instead to demand abolish or nationalization of SAITM, created serious doubts among the masses. That went against the striking doctors. In many places there were attacks on striking doctors. It is true that many unions and left organisations urged the government to resolve the SAITM issue through a consultative rather than a confrontational process. Still many civil organisations campaigned openly against the strike.
FUTA Secretary Prof. Arjuna Parakrama condemned the attack on the protesting university students and said the violent repression of legitimate protests must cease. Conflicts and differences of opinion should be resolved through informed discussions free from violence and intimidation. Continued indifference to this matter will only lead to unrest in the national university system, he said. Prof. Parakrama insisted that the government must stand by its commitment to the right to protest and dissent. We were led to believe that violent repression of legitimate dissent was a thing of the past, but it does not appear to be so, said Prof. Parakrama.

Also he said those responsible for ordering the excessive use of force on the students must be held accountable. The FUTA wants the crisis in higher education to be addressed on a priority basis and that the SAITM issue which is a symptomatic example of this crisis be resolved immediately, he said. Prof. Parakrama said further that the State Medical Faculty students had boycotted lectures for four months, and university student unions across the country, including the Inter University Students Federation (IUSF), had staged demonstrations, seeking a positive response from the government on the SAITM issue. FUTA does not condone the increasingly confrontational protests by students, but at the same time the gratuitously violent state response should be condemned in the strongest possible terms. These are university students and future leaders of this country, he said.
That is interesting. However a leading person in the Medical Union said that if students are dissatisfied with the solutions given, they could take up arms as they did in 1988. This reveals the populist political ideology of the leaders of this struggle. Populist socialist vision in the end leads to Polpotian tyranny, sans democracy, sans justice.

Wozniacki douses British hopes at Eastbourne
EASTBOURNE June 30: Caroline Wozniacki extinguished British hopes at the Eastbourne pre-Wimbledon event on Friday, knocking out Heather Watson to reach the final after a back injury forced Johanna Konta to withdraw.
Seventh-ranked Konta, who suffered a nasty fall in Thursday's win over world number one Angelique Kerber, pulled out of her semi-final against Karolina Pliskova before Wozniacki accounted for Watson 6-2, 3-6, 7-5 at Devonshire Park.
Konta banged her head and back heavily after a horror tumble during her quarter-final victory over Kerber and has been diagnosed with a thoracic spine injury.
The 26-year-old is Britain's best hope of ending a long wait for a women's Grand Slam champion that dates back to Virginia Wade winning the 1977 Wimbledon singles title.
Konta, who won the prestigious Miami tournament earlier this season, had originally been passed fit to play on Friday but decided to pull out to avoid risking further damage.
The most important thing for me is to look after my health in general, said Konta, who because of the backlog of matches at Eastbourne had to play twice on Thursday.
We made the decision based on the fact I'm still quite sore through my thoracic spine. Next week is Wimbledon but I make decisions for my health. AFP

Zimbabawe humble Sri Lanka in record run chase
GALLE: First it was Bangladesh who recorded their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka in March and yesterday it was the turn of Zimbabwe to stun Sri Lanka as they chased down a target of 317 successfully to record their first ODI win in Sri Lanka. It was the highest successful run chase in Sri Lanka in 296 ODIs.
The venue was the Galle International Stadium which was hosting its first ODI since 2000 and Zimbabwe made it a memorable one for them as they swept to an emphatic six wickets win with 14 balls to spare to go one-up in the five-match series yesterday.

Yesterday also happened to be chairman of selectors Sanath Jayasuriyas 48th birthday and what an anti-climactic birthday present he received from the team he selected.
The foundation for Zimbabwes dramatic win was laid by opener Solomon Mire who scored his maiden ODI century and Sean Williams (65). They shared a record third wicket stand of 161 off 133 balls to set Zimbabwe on course for this famous win in their rather chequered history.
Although both batsmen were dismissed 11 balls of each other by the golden arm of Asela Gunaratne, Zimbabwe who bat deep till number 10 didnt lose any more wickets as Sikhander Raza (67 n.o.) and Malcolm Waller (40 n.o.) carried them to a win with an unbroken partnership of 102 off 80 balls.
Overall it was Zimbabwes eighth win against Sri Lanka in 51 ODIs.
Sri Lanka had only themselves to blame for the defeat as they spilled as many three catches  a malady which they are finding pretty hard to get rid of.
Mire and Williams were both missed and how costly it proved as Sri Lanka was to realize when the partnership between the two grew into ominous proportions. Centurion Mire was dropped twice at 17 by wicket-keeper Niroshan Dickwella off Amila Aponso and at 94 by Lasith Malinga at deep fine leg off Gunaratne. Williams was put down on 13 by Danushka Gunathilaka at point off Lahiru Madushanka. Had those chances been accepted Sri Lanka would have romped home quite comfortably but it was not to be their day. The lapses on the field hurt Sri Lanka deeply as Zimbabwe made capital out of them.
It was not only their fielding that let Sri Lanka down but also their bowling which was rather sub standard the way they bowled for an international side.
The chances of a defeat wouldnt have entered their minds when Sri Lanka ended their innings at 316-5 after electing to bat first.
Two youngsters Danushka Gunathilaka and Kusal Mendis laid the platform for that total with a 117-run stand. Both looked good to get hundreds but they perished playing some injudicious shots. Gunathilaka was out playing the reverse sweep and Mendis got a leading edge attempting to work the ball towards leg. Mendis made 86 off 80 balls and Gunathilaka 60 off 77. Mendis in the process became the second fastest Sri Lankan to reach 1000 runs in ODIs (28 innings) after Roy Dias (27 innings).
Upul Tharanga returning to the side after serving a two-match suspension for slow over rate held the innings for the rest of the overs to remain 79 not out forging two useful half-century partnerships with Angelo Mathews (49) and Gunaratne (28).
However all that effort was lost when Sri Lanka took the field for the Zimbabwe innings.
Mire was named Man of the Match.
The second ODI will be played at the same venue on Sunday.
