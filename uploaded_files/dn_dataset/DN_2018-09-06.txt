JO using public to cover up misdeeds
Just as the LTTE used innocent civilians as a human shields during the war, the JO is also using the public as shields to achieve their ulterior motive, UNP General Secretary and Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said yesterday.
The UNP has organized many protest rallies in the past, but with a certain purpose, he added.
But the JO does not have a purpose or an objective for this protest rally and it has made the public into a shield to hide the charges against leaders and JO members, he said.
But, no one can mislead the public today. It was the public who should react if any violence broke out as the Joint Opposition protest progressed, he added. Kariyawasam addressing the media at the Sirikotha yesterday said JO members are now tense with the special high courts proceeding progressing against culprits responsible for misuse of public funds and properties, killing of journalists and abductions.They are now trying to incite the public against the government,he said.
But, none of these can frighten us, the government and the judiciary.We have been accused of not taking action against corrupt people of the previous government. But, we did not want to interfere with the Judiciary as the previous government has done.
People launch anti-government protests when they lack freedom and their democratic rights are violated. But we have already restored democracy, freedom of expression and right to information.Since we have established unlimited freedom in the country and not engaged in crimes and corruption as previously done, they label us as an weak government, he added.
We want to hold all the forthcoming elections in due time.The Pohottuwa Party only obtained 40 percent of the votes at the previous Local Government election which means that 60 percent of votes were anti-Rajapaksa votes.We want to gain the victory at the forthcoming elections by obtaining the support of those 60 percent of votes from the anti Rajapaksa elements, he added.

Presidential Commission probing SriLankan Airlines:
Process to review SriLankans Strategic Business Plan questionable
The process of selecting the International Consultancy Service to review the SriLankan Airlines (SLA) Strategic Business Plan (SBP) 2010/11 to 2014/15 is questionable, the Head of Financial Management of SriLankan Airlines Yasantha Dissanayake testifying before the Commission for the second time said yesterday.
The Presidential Commission inquiring into frauds and malpractices at SriLankan Airlines, SriLankan Catering Ltd and Mihin Lanka (Pvt) Ltd met yesterday at the BMICH for the second time this week.
The SLA Business Plan 2010/11 to 2014/15 was prepared by S.A. Chandrasekara who was appointed as a Consultant by the Board of Directors of SLA on 4th March 2010 for three months till June. He has been paid Rs.250,000 per month and provided transport facilities to and from the office during his serving period as per the Board Paper dated March 12, 2010.
Accordingly, he had been paid Rs.750,000 for the three months for his service. Although, the SBP was prepared by Mr. Chandrasekara at a cost of Rs.750,000, it was revealed that SLA had paid USD 450,000, (approximately Rs.50.7 million) for it to be reviewed by an International Consultancy firm.
The witness told the Commission that after compiling the SBP by Chandrasekara, the General Treasury wanted it to be reviewed by an International Consultant. He also said that when a Business Plan is prepared, it should be reviewed by an International Consultant. Accordingly, then Chairman of SLA Nishantha Wickremesinghe appointed a five-member committee to select an International Consultant. This committee comprised with Nihal Jayamanna, Manilal Fernando, Krish Nonis, Manoj Gunawardhana, and the witness, Yasantha Dissanayake. According to the witness, the CEO of SLA and also a member of the five member committee Manoj Gunawardhana on July 31, 2010 has informed to the board meeting that the Business Plan had been sent to 12 international parties with the purpose of selecting an international consultant.
However, the witness told the Commission that out of 12, four international consultancy firms including SH&E Company, Seabury Aviation, Via-Capital, and InterVISTAS were short listed. For making the final selection, those companies made presentations in the presence of the five member committee; he confirmed referring to the board minute dated 19th October 2010.
The best presentation was from Dr. Emer Serpen, who represented the InterVISTAS. Dr. Serpen is an expert in this kind of work, the witness told the commission. Accordingly, based on the presentation made, the InterVISTAS was selected, he said. But, it was also revealed yesterday that proposal made by the InterVISTAS was a joint proposal with the Via- Capital Company.
However, the witness revealed before the Commission that a letter dated December 1, 2010 informed that the SLA was entering an agreement with Via- Capital. The agreement was signed on December 3, 2010.
When questioned by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe as to why the Committee selected Via- Capital as the International Consultancy firm if Emer Serpen is not an employee of that company and why it was selected when they have no previous experience either, the witness answered that he was not aware how their name came about. When asked by him as to who selected the Via  Capital, the witness answered that only two committee members, Nihal Jayamanna and Manilal Fernando recommended the selection of Via- Capital.
He said that the rest of the three members of the SLA Chairmans Committee did not subscribe to sign for the selection of Via- Capital as the relevant document was not given for them to sign.
The commission will further question Head of Financial Management of SriLankan Airlines Yasantha Dissanayake today.

AGs advice sought to take over frozen Perpetual funds - PM
The Government has sought the Attorney Generals advice on whether it can take over the Rs 11 billion in the frozen bank accounts of Perpetual Treasuries Group, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informed Parliament yesterday.
The Prime Minister, responding to a question by Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said the AG has been consulted as to whether this money could be taken over without waiting till the conclusion of the on-going case in the Colombo High Court.
He said Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera and he sought the AGs advice in this regard. The PM pointed out this amount in the bank accounts frozen by the Central Bank is more than the loss incurred due to the questionable Treasury Bonds issuance.
Replying to MP Dissanayake as to whether the the Government is ready to forward the Treasury Bonds case to the recently initiated Special High Courts, the PM said that the AG and the Police are free to do so upon the conclusion of the on-going investigation.
He said he would ask the AGs Department and the Bribery Commission to expedite the investigation and finish it soon.
The PM responding to MP Dissanayakes query as to whether he is prepared to make a personal intervention to bring former Central Bank Governor Arjuna Mahendran back to the country, the PM said that all the possible legal steps in that regard have already been taken. Inform me if there is anything else that we can do. I have had no contacts with him after he left the country. My lawyers advised me to sever all my connections with him.I read in newspapers that Mahendrans lawyers had sought information from court, he said.
MP Dissanayake queried the progress of setting up of special high courts as per the recent amendment made to the Judicature Act. He also queried the progress of investigations pertaining to the Central Bank Treasury Bonds scam.
The PM said another permanent High Court to try the cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes would be set up in the Western Province shortly. He said the case of misappropriating UDA funds to erect the D. A. Rajapaksa statue and museum in Weeraketiya, Madamulana and the case of misappropriating funds of Litro Gas Lanka have already been forwarded to the newly formed permanent high court.
Explaining the procedure taken to select the cases forwarded to the special high courts, the PM said the Chief Justice makes the decision after studying the reports sent by the AG or the Bribery Commission Director General.
We adhere to a very transparent procedure and there is no political involvement here. I admire the interest shown by MP Dissanayake in this regard, but I request him to be patient as the procedure takes time. Eventually justice will be met, he added.

Around 500 people join JO rally at Nugegoda
Nearly 500 people boarded buses from Udahamulla, Nugegoda, and headed to Colombo to join the Jana Balaya rally organised by the Joint Opposition (JO) yesterday morning.
The crowd first had an early lunch at Western Province Councillor Upali Kodikaras home before making their way to Maharagama and via the High Level Road to the Viharamahadevi Park in Colombo, where they awaited instructions regarding the venue the rally was to be held.
We are joining this struggle to bring back Mahinda Rajapaksa as the leader of this country, former Mayor and National Organiser of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna for Maharagama, Kanthi Kodikara, told the Daily News.
She said the current government is trying to sell Sri Lanka to international entities and this needs to be stopped before it is too late. Kodikara said people want a leader like Mahinda Rajapaksa to steer the country in the right direction.
She added that the current government is attempting to make it impossible for Rajapaksa to contest in Presidential elections again, but she is hopeful that he will be appointed the Prime Minister.
Crowds were seen gathering at several venues around Colombo including the Viharamahadevi Park, Lake House Roundabout, Maradana and Fort. Most of the buses used for the transportation of crowds, even those that headed from Maharagama, were from outstations.
Interestingly, the protesters held similar slogans and wore same coloured caps, showing that the rally was well-organised and coordinated. They were also provided with alcohol and soft drinks.
Most of them urged President Maitripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to resign.
We need a new ruler. That is why I am participating in this protest. All this government does is attack the common man with taxes and high Cost of Living. We cant live this way, said H.B.Thilakaratna, 61, a businessman from Mirihana who joined the rally from Maharagama.
Meanwhile, Galle District Organiser of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Razick Anver who arrived in Colombo with his crowd around 2.45 pm said he is hopeful that the rally will lay foundation for a change.
The Muslim community is here for want of a change. We are going through a really bad economic crisis. Our businesses are failing. Only Mahinda Rajapaksa can change this situation, Anver said.
He said most of the people who joined him in the rally were former UNP supporters.

ON THE SPOT REPORTS
Confusion reigns at JO Jana Balaya
As supporters of the Joint Opposition led by Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and JO stalwarts converged at the Lake House roundabout yesterday evening for the planned Jana Balaya anti-government protest, confusion reigned with its organisers maintaining a stoic silence regarding their plans. Crowds blocked the roads in the area surrounding Lakehouse. However, there was no centre point in the protest with politicians and crowds scattered in pocket groups wandering around aimlessly.
The protest march began at the Colombo Fort Bo-Tree junction with the arrival of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa around 3.30 pm.
The roads were cleared by the time making way for the protestors as many offices in Colombo had allowed its employees to leave early in anticipation of a rally. However, many commuters were left standing in long queues at the Colombo Fort Railway Station with trains packed to the brim. Busses were also less in numbers as a result of the protest.
The protestors marched towards the Lake House roundabout with Mahinda Rajapaksa heading it in a motorcade where they were joined by crowds that had gathered there. However, the Rajapaksas headed in different directions leaving the protestors at the roundabout to enjoy refreshments where they were entertained by papare bands. They were later seen being addressed by JO stalwart parliamentarian Weerawansa.
No riot Police presence was seen with a small number of Special task force personnel (STF) and Police provided security around the Lake House Roundabout and its surroundings.
Crowds, however, thinned towards the latter part of the evening as the group attempted to stage a sit-in while roads in many other areas in Colombo such as Maradana, Galle Road, Peliyagoda were cleared for traffic.

Abuse of public assets and state funds:
I AM FOR DEATH PENALTY - PRESIDENT
Death Penalty should be included as a punishment for offenses relating to abuse of public assets and state funds, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
If such a law be brought in during my tenure, I am ready to impose it on one or two of such persons who have misused and abused public assets and state funds, President Sirisena pointed out.
The President made these observations while participating in the National Awards Ceremony organised by the Committee on Public Accounts (COPA), recognising State Institutions with high level performances which was held at the Parliament Complex yesterday morning.
President Sirisena was also critical of the delay in taking legal action based on findings and recommendations forwarded by several Presidential Commissions that he appointed in the recent past.
He said people should witness action being taken upon the findings and recommendations of these Presidential Commissions.
Most commit offenses such as these because we do not properly implement laws. Unlike in Sri Lanka, in countries such as China and Singapore, they dont take years to hear cases. They finish off within two weeks or so. They even impose the death penalty. Even though we have the death penalty in Sri Lanka, we do not enforce it. Since this is an important event held at Parliament premises, I would wish to request all political parties to support an initiative to include death penalty as a punishment for those who misuse or abuse public assets and state funds. President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena expressed his disappointment of the recent move by the government to withdraw a motion included into the Order Paper of Parliament to increase the salary and allowances paid to Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe. He pointed out that he is not aware as to why such a move was taken.
The proposal to increase the AGs salary has already been delayed for two or three years. Before two weeks, the Order Paper in reference to the salary increase was again withdrawn. Why, am I not aware of. This will discourage an officer who contributes earnestly to the job he is doing.What is the use if they cannot even get the salary they are supposed to.We should encourage and strengthen such officers. Then they will perform more, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena also said that the government will soon establish the Sri Lanka State Audit Service which will be a crucial part in curbing corruption in the country. Speaking of the efficiency of the government service, President Sirisena observed that Sri Lanka could achieve rapid development if those who are attached to the government sector work properly at least for four working hours.
President Sirisena commended COPA Chairman Lasantha Alagiyawanne for the achievements made by COPA and future projects the Committee has undertaken. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, State Minister Eran Wickremeratne, parliamentarians, ministry secretaries and government officers were present at the event.

Importance  of  Business  Environment  Analysis
Due to the emergence of the globalization and its influence, business organizations around the world have to face numerous challenges and issues often. Therefore, the decision makers of the business entities have to devote much time on analyzing their businesses from time to time in order to survive in their respective business than ever before.
Whether we like it or not, global businesses too have to face a number of challenges due to the influences of the rising economies in China and India. Even though Sri Lanka is a relatively small market in the global business map, Sri Lanka, too has to face the consequences of the changing business environments around the globe. Therefore, the managers or the decision-makers of the business organizations in Sri Lanka too should possess a thorough understanding on analyzing the change in the business environment if they are to survive and sustain in the long run in their relevant markets.
However, it is a fact that many decision-makers do fail to understand or to analyze the business environment properly and as a result, they tend to make erroneous decisions regarding their respective businesses. As a result of such failure in decision making, it could adversely affect the profits, business growth, competitiveness of the companies to a greater level and perhaps it may cause them to shut their businesses at last. Therefore, this brief article on the above topic intends to discuss some of strategic analysis tools that can be exercise by the managers in order to analyze their business environment fruitfully.
What is business environment analysis (BEA)
As per Renee OFarrel, Business Environment Analysis is a systematic process by which environmental factors in a business are identified, their impact is assessed and a strategy is developed to mitigate and/or to take advantage of them.
Thus, as clearly mentioned above, the decision-makers should be able to understand the changing environment perfectly and should be able to predict how such changing environmental factors could influence over their particular business before they make decisions pertaining to their business.
In order to easy understand, these environmental factors could be primarily identified as, Internal factors and External factors. For an instance strengths and weaknesses of an organization could be identified as internal to the organization, while opportunities and threats for an organization generally relate to external factors.
Purpose of the Business Environment Analysis
The purpose of the Business Environment Analysis is to identify the potential influence of particular aspects of the general (economic, political, cultural, technological, natural, demographic, international environments) and operating environments (companys suppliers, customers, competitors, and public) on business operation.
Furthermore, an analysis of business environment facilitates managers to identify strengths, weaknesses, opportunities and threats that are to be addressed by them. Thus, such analysis is quite important for the existence and for the progress of the business entities.
Identification of strengths
As mentioned above, strength of organizations are classified as an internal aspect. For instance, if an organization possesses a solid HR policy, the job satisfaction and the performance of the employees could be improved. Thus, a happy workforce will be expected to deliver more fruitful results to the company. Therefore, satisfied employees can be seen as one of the strengths of that particular company when compared with its rivals who do not have such HR policy and satisfied employees. Once a company identifies its strengths, the company should take necessary steps to consolidate its strengths by further improvements in its existing plans and policies.
Identification of weaknesses
Like strengths, business organizations naturally have weakness as well. Therefore, identifying the weaknesses of the organization also has an equal importance for an organization in order to move forward by mitigating such weaknesses to an acceptable level.
Identification of opportunities
Even an organization is solid in its business; it should not hesitate to seek further expansion in their business. Therefore, analyzing the external environment will facilitate companies to identify the opportunities that exist in the market.
Identification of threats
When there is a severe competition in the market, companies have to face a number of threats from their competitors; also, there will be a threat of substitution for their products and services as well. Thus, proper environmental analysis could assist managers to identify the relevant threats from the external environment in advance and it will enable them to find out appropriate remedial action to encounter such threats from the outside in advance.
By doing a proper business environment analysis, organizations could achieve number of other benefits as well. Such business analysis will enable companies to be flexible in their respective business; will enable to make use of the limited resources of the company productively, predicting probable future issues of the organization, companys adoptability and companys sustainability.
Environmental frameworks
As discussed before, managers or the decision-makers of business organizations around the world tend to exercise a number of strategic analysis tools to analyze their businesses and business environment. Therefore, this concise article primarily focuses on the much preferred and most popular strategic analysis tools such as PEST Analysis or PESTEL Analysis, SWOT Analysis.
PEST Analysis or PESTEL Analysis
PESTLE analysis, which is sometimes referred as PEST analysis, is a concept in marketing principles. This concept is used as a tool by companies to track the environment they are operating in or are planning to launch a new product, service or project.
All the aspects of this technique are vital for any industry or business.
This particular framework facilitates managers in strategic management that not only defines what a company should do, but also important for an organizations goals. Therefore, PEST/PESTLE Analysis enables managers to understand the External Factors that could have an effect on the business.
What does PESTLE stand for:
P - Political,
E - Economic,
S - Social,
T - Technological,
L - Legal,
E - Environmental
Political factors
Government holds the power of governing the country and it decides the policies that should be adopted time to time. Thus, understanding of the degree of government intervention in the economy is crucial for business organizations to operate within the stipulated laws and regulations set by the government from time to time.
Accordingly, companies should be able to address the prevailing and expected future legislations and to adjust their strategies and policies accordingly. These political factors include government policies, political stability or instability, governments foreign trade policy, tax policies, labour laws and environmental laws.
Economic factors
Economic factors too have an important impact on how the company operates its business in a highly competitive environment. These economic factors could be further classified into macro-economic and micro-economic factors. These economic factors include interest rates, exchange rates, inflation, economic growth and disposable income of consumers.
Social factors
Social factors also called as socio-cultural factors and the areas that involve the shared belief and attitudes of the population. These social factors include growth of population, gender demographics, age distribution, health conditions, educational levels, social lifestyle and attitudes.
Technological factors
Technology is a factor that is being ever changed; therefore, adopting the latest technology is crucial for organizations to make best results and to reap substantial profits. These technological factors influence the innovations in production, distribution and communication of business organizations.
Environmental factors
With the demand of consumers, the business entities are forced to concern about environment to a greater extend when compared to the past. Thus, companies tend to be more ethical and sustainable when doing their business.
Legal factors
Business organizations should have a thorough understanding on what is legal and what is illegal while carrying out their businesses. This has more impact when an organization involves in international trade as each country has its own rules and regulations. These legal factors include product regulation, employment regulations, health & safety regulations, equal opportunities, advertising standards, consumer rights and laws.
The SWOT Analysis
This is perhaps the most popular strategic tool amongst the managers of the business firms around the world. Therefore, most of such decision-makers considered that the SWOT analysis is an extremely useful tool for them to understand and decision-making for all sorts of situations in business and organizations. In SWOT analysis, the strengths and weaknesses are often identified as an internal to the organization, while the opportunities and threats generally relate to the external factors. Thus, SWOT is sometimes called as an Internal-External Analysis and the SWOT Matrix is sometimes called an IE Matrix.
SWOT stands for;
l S -Strengths,
l W-Weaknesses,
l O -Opportunities and
l T -Threats.
Usefulness of SWOT Analysis
The SWOT analysis cannot be limited to profit making institutions alone. It can be used for other organizations such as governmental firms, other private organizations and also for individuals as well. SWOT analysis certainly helps everyone to analyses their strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats.
Therefore, SWOT analysis can be considered as an important analysis method that can be applied to organizations as well as for the individuals. However, generally the SWOT analysis is carried out by the Marketing Managers than the other managers in other organizations.
SWOT Analysis for the Managers and Decision-Makers
SWOT Analysis facilitates managers to evaluate the organizations resources and to link them with the firms business strategy. It also involves specifying the objective of the business venture and helps to identify the internal and external factors that are favorable and unfavorable to achieve the objectives.
Analyzing the SWOT properly and accurately is quite crucial. Because, subsequent steps in the process of planning for achievement of the decided objective may be derived from the SWOT Analysis. Thus, with the assistance of SWOT analysis the decision-makers can make vital decisions with regard to their future cause of actions properly.
Why SWOT Analysis
The prime objective of the SWOT Analysis is to identify the key internal and external factors which are crucial to achieve the desired objectives. Consequently, the environmental factor under the SWOT analysis could be identified as follows.
l Internal factors
l External factors
Internal and external factors
Internal factors
The strengths and weaknesses have been identified as internal factors to the organization. Hence, this may include human recourses (personnel), financial position and manufacturing capabilities.
External factors
The opportunities and threats have been identified as external factors to the organization. However, you may find some opportunities lying within the organization or in an individual which are not yet exploited or not yet revealed as well. In addition to those external factors it may include technological changes, socio-cultural changes. However, due to above two key factors, SWOT Analysis is sometimes called Internal-External Analysis as well.
Conclusion
The prime objective of any business organization is to increase the profit by utilizing of limited resources. Therefore, the decision-makers in business entities are under tremendous pressure to formulate proper business strategies in order to achieve organizational goals and objectives.
Therefore, as discussed, managers utilize tools such as PESTLE and SWOT to analyze the business environment which they are operating. Therefore, once managers identified those environmental factors which could influence the success of a business company in future, assumptions can be made with regard to the future development of those factors and subsequently a viable strategy could be formed accordingly. However, it is important to have a proper mechanism in place to assess (monitoring/feedback) the strategy on periodical basis and proper system to update the strategy accordingly. In conclusion, it can be assumed that the proper utilization of strategic analysis tools such as PEST Analysis or PESTEL Analysis, SWOT Analysis will surely enable the managers or the decision-makers of the Sri Lankan business organizations to identify the environmental factors properly and to assess their impacts and to develop an appropriate strategy to mitigate and/or to take advantage of them to make the business sustainable and profitable.

Industry wants right operational model for NSW
Sri Lankas shipping and logistics industry professionals stressed the need to explore the sustainability and operational model of National Single Window (NSW) platform immediately.
There is a cost when it comes to maintaining the NSW and it is imperative to determine whether operator could be a specialized government agency, Government Corporation or Public Private Partnership, said Anoma Ranasinghe, General Manager at McLarens Group.
Making a presentation on Going Paperless; Sri Lanka Way Forward, at the Asia Logistics Forum held in Colombo this week, she said the effective implementation of NSW will significantly reduce time, cost and documents required for trading. Furthermore, the plan is to bring 30 plus government regulatory agencies involved in imports and exports on board under the NSW platform by almost 2019.
In July 2018, Sri Lanka launched NSW to facilitate the trading community, giving access to online system of regulatory agencies involved in exports and imports. NSW allows exporters and importers to submit documents at single location or entry point to fulfill all trade related regulatory requirements, thereby facilitating cross border trade.
She said further that currently Sri Lanka got close to the completion of automation of customs and port procedures while several countries in the world as well as Asia and Pacific region have elevated themselves from this stage and are now in the process of introducing paperless trade across borders. Administrative costs are becoming higher than the transport cost in shipping and logistics industry in Sri Lanka. When dealing with papers, enormous costs are incurred when handling international trade related documents.
However, shipping and freight forwarding are fast becoming paperless business; the question is whether Sri Lanka is geared for these developments. I would say we are slow in our progress, but steady, she said.
She said that impact study published by UN shows that the implementation of paperless trade could help Sri Lanka to reduce its trade time up to 25% and boost exports by 7-8%. Also the report highlights it will also help reduce Sri Lankas overall cost of trade by US $ 240 million a year.

Jinasena launches Nano Technology Water Purification Plant in Polonnaruwa
Jinasena (Pvt) Limited, one of the leading water management systems and solutions providers and the market leader in Reverse Osmosis (RO) plants in Sri Lanka, has launched the countrys first-ever Nano Technology Water Purification System with the opening of a brand-new plant in Polonnaruwa as one of their many CSR initiatives.
The plant at Segala village in the Polonnaruwa District was ceremoniously opened by Minister of Finance and Mass Media, Mangala Samaraweera and State Minister for Higher Education, Mohan Lal Grero. Several government officials, management and staff from Jinasena and a large number of well-wishers also attended the event.
The Jinasena J-AQUA Nano Technology Water Purification Systems use Nano Filtration (NF) water filters. NF is a membrane water purification process that will remove salts of larger valency 2 or divalent elements, but will let monovalent salt molecules like Sodium Chloride to pass through. One of the main uses of NF membranes in industrial applications is to soften water or remove water hardness.
NF is ideally-suited for water purification of any water source with Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) less than a 1500ppm. NF water filters also remove toxic heavy metals and other organic compounds from water thereby getting rid of bad odours and tastes.
Jinasena has witnessed a surge in the demand for water purification plants in the Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD) affected areas of the island.
The company has extensive experience in deploying large water purification plants in Sri Lanka having ventured into this specialised field back in 2005 in keeping with the vision of Chairman Rohan Jinasena.
Over the past 3 years alone, the company has successfully carried out over 200 water purification plant projects for a variety of organizations in CKD-affected areas in North Central, Eastern, Northern, North Western and Central Provinces. At present, the company is handling 88 ongoing projects having completed over 100 projects during 2017. With each water purification plant providing water to up to 300 families, to date, the company has successfully provided clean water to over 25,000 families across the island.
Commenting on the new technology, Nalin Ganegoda, Deputy General Manager (Water Purification) said, It is widely-known that, across numerous industries, Nano technology is considered to be the future. As a company that is always ready to embrace new technology, it gives us great pleasure to launch our very first Nano Technology Water Purification Plant and help increase the quality of life for around 350 families in the Segala village. Prior to our involvement through this CSR project, these families have had access to poor quality water from tube wells, which has unfortunately resulted in an increase in CKD cases in the village. We believe that this plant will help combat the spread of CKD in the village as the families now have access to safe drinking water.
After successful implementation of a plant, Jinasena is able to provide a professional after-sales service through 19 Sales Centres around the country.
The company entrusts the day-to-day operational aspects of the plants to the Community Based Organisations (CBOs) of each village. With the support of the Jinasena engineers, who visit each and every plant at least once a month, as well as the companys mobile team operating 365 days of the year, the plants are able to run smoothly and provide clean water for thousands of families across the island.

Jos Janabalaya turns carnivale
Papare bands, ice lolly bikes to keep supporters entertained:Protestors disperse by 7PM, no overnight occupation of the city:With no political epicenter and speeches, demonstration descends into chaos:This is a democratic government and we proved it today  they came, they protested and they left. Tomorrow we get on with business: Kabir Hashim:Thousands surround Lake House round-about:Rally was set up to be launch-pad for Namal:
Full of sound and fury, the Joint Opposition-Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna Janabalaya demonstration reached Colombo Fort yesterday, but the protest took on a carnival like atmosphere with no major political speeches or centralized coordination to drive its key messages home.
The rally, which was set up to be a launch pad for Hambantota District MP and former first son Namal Rajapaksa, brought thousands to the Lake House round-about by 4 PM. Joining the marchers near the Colombo Fort Railway station, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his brother Gotabhaya Rajapaksa and their security contingents rode in convoy through the crowds.
The final location of the protest was kept a tightly guarded secret till noon yesterday, but the decision backfired since there was no apparent leadership, leaving the crowds without direction once they got to Fort.
In high spirits, the protestors ate ice lollies and spicy pineapple and danced on the street while papare bands provided music, in what appeared to be more like a big match party than an anti-Government demonstration. Confusion reigned till 7 PM, when SLPP Colombo Municipal Council Member and Spokesman for former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Milinda Rajapakshe claimed the crowds would have to decide if they were going to stay overnight or disperse, even after rash promises by JO leaders that they would occupy the city till Thursday if the Government did not provide an adequate response to the protest.
Residents of the city of Colombo cleared the way for the JO demonstration, with many offices allowing employees to work from home, while parents kept children away from school fearing the demonstration would block roads by afternoon, making it impossible to fetch them back home.
Offices in the Colombo Fort and Pettah areas also sent employees home early, fearing they would be stranded in the city centre once the rally began. Trains and buses were packed to the brim as commuters rushed to get out of Fort before the march moved in.
Traffic was at a minimum throughout the city except in the Fort area between 2-8 PM.
The problem was that Namal Rajapaksa was more interested in showing his strength to his uncle, rather than to the Government, quipped one SLFP member who wished to remain anonymous, after the rally ended uneventfully last night. While the former Defence Secretary made an appearance at the demonstration, supporters of his bid for the Presidency believe the show of force may have been much stronger if it had been organized by his team.
The anti-government protest organised by the Joint Opposition brought productivity in Colombo to a standstill. Businesses in Pettah, the busiest commercial shopping district in the island, where most of the shops, textiles, buildings and many other business organisations are centered shut doors early, a majority of employees from the vibrant World Trade Centre located in Fort, the heart of the Central Business District took a half day at their workplaces.
We closed our offices early anticipating the heavy inconvenience this protest will cause to the employees. We have lost a lot of businesses due to this, a chief executive of a prominent organisation involved in IT and BPO services industry, whose office is located at the bustling World Trade Centre in Colombo said.
However, small-time vendors like ice cream sellers, grams, water bottles, pineapples and other snack retailers had a field day with brisk business in what seemed a day- night carnival.
Speaking to the Daily News, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale said she was saddened by the fact that the Rajapaksas who drove the country into an economic crisis by miring it deeper and deeper in debt were now deliberately doing further damage even in opposition.
Productivity in the city of Colombo was at a standstill because of the JO show, so many parents did not send their children to school today fearing chaos, the Justice Minister said. It was grossly unfair to deny children access to education, but it was in the Rajapaksas dont place a heavy value on education, she added.
Worse still children had to stay home from school, and when they put the TV on at night, they have to watch drunk men roaming the streets of the city, she charged.
Minister Kabir Hashim said the JO was hoping this demonstration would be something like the UNP Jana Bala Meheyuma of 2001. What they wanted was a crackdown like there was in 2001. They wanted the police to fire into the crowd, tear gas the protestors and bring war to the streets of the capital. In short they wanted the Government to act like a repressive regime  but this is a democratic government and we proved it today  they came, they protested and they left. They have left a mess behind in the city, but just like the economy, we will clean it up. Tomorrow we get on with business, Hashim told Daily News.
Addressing a press briefing at the Government Information Department last night, Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said Prince Namals first battle was a total flop.
Bandara claimed the leaders of the SLPP had booked rooms in several five-star hotels, while hoping to get their supporters to sleep on the streets. Deputy Minister Ajith P Perera who was also at the press conference last night, said 81 people who had passed out from intoxication had been rescued by the 1990 ambulance service and taken to hospital. This was an immature effort, Perera asserted.
Crowds were later seen being addressed by JO stalwart parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa in clusters. But without a stage or a grounds booked for a rally, there were no speeches by the former President or the former Defence Secretary, or even Namal Rajapaksa who organised the Janabalaya Colambata march.
Thousands of police personnel were on standby, but none were visible in proximity to the demonstration, which concluded peacefully by 8PM, with much of the crowd dispersing and returning to their buses much earlier. Significantly no riot police squads or STF personnel were deployed near the protestors.

He said despite obstacles, a large crowd had gathered in Colombo and said more obstacles will only further strengthen the JO. He said the JO will organise similar protests in the future as well.
Meanwhile, a section of the crowd gathered in the Fort area for the protest started a Satyagraha last night.

Speaker regrets Dineshs mix up regarding Opposition Leaders post
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya yesterday said that he deeply regretted that MP Dinesh Gunawardena mixed up the official visit to India with the Opposition Leader post in Parliament.
The Speaker made the above observation in a reply letter to Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
MP Gunawardena wrote to the Speaker on Monday, refusing to join the multi-party Sri Lankan delegation to New Delhi, India.
Gunawardena stated that he did not want to be a part of the multi-party delegation led by Speaker Jayasuriya, as the JOs right of holding the Opposition Leader post in Parliament was denied.
Speaker Jayasuriya in response, stated that he invit Gunawardena for the New Delhi visit with good intentions.
When I invited MPs to be a part of this delegation, I did not consider the posts they hold in the Opposition. MPs such as the All Ceylon Makkal Congress (ACMC) leader Rishad Bathiudeen, Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) leader Rauff Hakeem had also been invited on behalf of their parties.
Therefore, I deeply regret of you being concerning confused this visit with the Opposition Leader post, Speaker Jayasuriya said.
India has invited a multi-party Sri Lankan delegation to visit New Delhi for a familiarisation tour where bilateral matters will be discussed. The delegation was led by Speaker Jayasuriya.
Gunawardena had been invited to be a part of that delegation on behalf of the JO by Speaker Jayasuriya.
PM calls for more stringent laws pertaining to plastic waste
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe brought under the consideration of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) that laws pertaining to plastic waste should be further strengthened.
Responding to queries raised by MP Hesha Withanage about factories that dispose plastic materials to the environment without following a proper system, the Prime Minister said the National Environmental Act does not recognise the factory that collects and stores plastic materials as a cause for environment pollution.
He further said that it was not necessary for them to obtain an environment protection license. They need not obtain any regulations from CEA when plastic materials are stored, but a business license is necessary.
But factories that recycle plastic material should obtain an environment protection license. The CEA would take legal action against factories that recycle plastic materials without a license, while the CEA would look into factories that disperse waste water to water bodies, as they have the power to take legal action when required, he said.
Speaking about pollution to the drinking water bodies, the Prime Minister said that already measures have been taken to provide free sample testing to those water bodies if a complaint is made to the CEA.
Luxury rooms reserved for JO MPs, while supporters are forced to sleep on streets - Deputy Minister
Luxury rooms at Taj Samudra, Hilton and Shangri-La hotels in Colombo had been reserved by Joint Opposition MPs to stay overnight, while the people who came to Colombo to support the JO protest were forced to sleep on streets, Law and Order Deputy Minister Nalin Bandara said.
Speaking during the Parliamentary debate yesterday, he revealed that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has booked Suite Room Number 754 of the Taj Samudra hotel to stay the night.
Bandara added that rooms in luxury hotels such as Hilton and Shangri-La had also been booked for the JO MPs and their close associates and cronies to stay overnight.
The ordinary people who were taken to Colombo in hired buses to take part in the protest will have to spend the night on the road. While the protestors were given a Rs.150 rice packet each, the JO leaders enjoy all the luxuries at hotels. This reflects the real picture of the JO, he commented.
This Government has two more years to complete its term. The JO MPs are agitated as the law is catching up with them. Their cases are being taken up at the Special High Courts. They foresee their fate. That is why the JO is trying to grab power by using innocent people as shields, he added.
Deputy Minister Bandara said the Government had assured the rights of the people to hold protests, adding that it has given instructions to the Police to guarantee the safety of the public and public property.
We do not use state power or thuggery to suppress protests. However, we will implement the law to the letter, if public property is damaged, he noted.
The Government is ready to take up any challenge. The Government will do its duty to the country and the people, but we will not deceive anybody through fantasies and false promises, he added.
New law to provide compensation for deaths caused by wrongful acts
The Government is to bring in a new law to provide for the recovery of damages for the death of a person caused by a wrongful act, omission, negligence or default of another.
According to the new Bill titled Recovery of Damages for the Death of a Person gazetted on Monday, the family members or the guardians of the deceased person will have the right to maintain an action for damages against the person whose wrongful act, omission, negligence or default caused the death of that person.
The parents, children, siblings, grandparents or the guardians of the person whose death had been caused by the above mentioned reasons, have the right to apply for the recovery of damages for the loss of that persons love, affection, care and companionship and the mental pain and suffering.
The Bill will be presented for First Reading in Parliament shortly by Justice and Prison Reforms Minister Thalatha Athukorala.
The Court can seek the assistance of one or more experts for the purpose of deciding any matter under this Act. Any applicant who has abandoned the deceased person will not be entitled to claim damages under this legislation.
JVP presents 20th A to House for First Reading
JVP MP Vijitha Herath yesterday, presented the 20th Amendment to the Constitution to Parliament for First Reading in order to abolish the Executive Presidency.

MP Herath pointed out that with measures being taken to formulate a new Constitution in order to strengthen the democratic system in the country, it was vital that the Executive Presidency be abolished.

Pinnawala losing out to private parties
The Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage which is a major tourist attraction is losing out to private elephant owners in the vicinity.
The orphanage, launched in 1975, attracted hordes of tourists in the past. Tourists particularly enjoyed the elephant bath and feeding baby elephants.
However, the number of tourists visiting the orphanage has been diminishing since private elephant owners along the Kegalle - Pinnawala road have used various ruses to get tourists to visit their sheds instead of the orphanage.
They have also teamed up to prevent the orphanage from getting new baby elephants for its care.
Tourist guides too are in league with these private owners due to the heavy tips they get. Some of them said there is nothing interesting at the orphanage for the entry fee of Rs. 2,500 charged for each foreign tourist.
Moreover, the orphanage does not get many baby elephants for its care since most baby elephants are sent to the Uda Walawe transit home which gets preference.
There is also a decrease in baby elephants because the orphanage has now stopped the elephant breeding programme, according to some employees at the facility. The Pinnawala orphanage was launched under a concept of late Minister P.B.G. Kalugalle. It was vested with the Department of Zoological Gardens in 1987. Reports said the orphanage now has a herd of nearly 80 elephants.
When contacted, the orphanages Deputy Director Renuka Bandaranayake said she could not comment on the issue without approval from higher authorities.
