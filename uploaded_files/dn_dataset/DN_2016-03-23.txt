National rankings for juniors will be awarded in four categories; Gold age group 15 - 17, Silver age group 12  14, Bronze age group 10  11 and Copper age group 9 and below.
Importantly, NDB Wealths sponsorship will offer both the equipment and training programs for young golfers, enabling their talent to be nurtured further.

Sri Lanka to seek China's assistance in power sector
Sri Lanka is to seek assistance and support from China to operate the country's main power plant, a deputy minister said on Wednesday.

Deputy Minister of Power and Energy Ajith Perera told Xinhua that the government would soon discuss the matter with China.

Sri Lankan's power sector has been facing a crisis in recent months with three nationwide power failures reported since September last year.

The latest country-wide breakdown was reported on March 13, with power cut off for more than seven hours, the longest in 20 years.

The failure occurred due to an explosion in an electricity transformer on the outskirts of the capital which prompted authorities to initiate an immediate probe.

Days later, another substation in Kotugoda, also on the suburbs of the capital, caught fire after exploding, plunging parts of the country into darkness.

On Monday, the government announced that experts from Japan and Germany were investigating the cause of the latest power failure and Japanese technicians had conducted tests on the state-run Ceylon Electricity Board (CEB) transformers which exploded.

The government said they had sent samples to Japan for further tests.

"We are awaiting the outcome of these investigations by the international and local experts and once we receive that, the government will set a specific agenda on what to do in the future to avoid such power failures," Perera said.

Soon after that, he added, the government will hold discussions with the Chinese government to seek assistance and support to operate the Norochcholai Power Plant.

Sri Lanka has already deployed army at all power installations and substations after suspicions were raised that the power failure earlier this month could have been an act of sabotage.(xinhuanet)

This transition is going to take long

Since being elevated to the ranks of a full member of the ICC 35 years ago, the Sri Lankan team has gone through many periods of transition, but come through it very quickly so that the effect has not been felt so much as to affect team performances to a great extent. What the current team under Angelo Mathews is going through is a shortfall in batting experience left by the retirements of two legends Kumar Sangakkara and Mahela Jayawardene and very soon they will be struggling with the bowling department as well with Lasith Malinga and Rangana Herath who are carrying injuries not looking too far ahead before hanging up their boots.
These are difficult periods for a country where expectation of the fans is high from the national team to start winning consistently and be among the top nations. The pressure for the national team to win constantly was not there during the pre-World Cup winning era when defeats were accepted as part and parcel of a team that was trying to find its feet in international cricket.
During the period 1982-1995, Sri Lanka played 60 Tests and won only five of them  the highlights of it being maiden Test victories against India (1985) and Pakistan (1986) both at home and a first Test series victory overseas in New Zealand (1994-95). In One-Day Internationals the only major title they won prior to winning the 1996 World Cup was the Asia Cup in 1986 at home where India did not participate.
All that was to change when Ana Punchihewa became president of the Sri Lanka Cricket Board in 1995. He had the foresight to see that if Sri Lanka was to compete with other nations they required a foreign coach with expert knowledge on how to be prepared for an international event. It was not so much the case of teaching the players the technical skills but on how to be mentally strong, to absorb pressure and to be physically fit and agile on the field.
Sri Lanka-born Australian Davenall Whatmore was to become the first of a long line of foreign coaches Sri Lanka was to enlist that saw the countrys cricketing stocks rise to its summit. Whatmore proved an instance success when Sri Lanka won the Cricket World Cup in 1996 and that paved the way for successive Cricket Boards to recruit foreign coaches mainly from Australia as Sri Lanka tasted success after success from there on.
Present coach Graham Ford from South Africa is faced with the difficult task of trying to put together a match winning combination in the ongoing World T20 tournament where he is handicapped without the services of two players who could have made a world of difference to the team  fast bowler Lasith Malinga (injured) and explosive opener Kusal Perera (suspended after being tested for a banned substance). The absence of these two players whose style of play is well suited to T20 cricket has resulted in Sri Lanka struggling to compete with top countries in the ongoing tournament. Their main concern is their batting which has not been able to put up totals in excess of 150 that would give their bowlers a chance to bowl at the opposition. They have not been helped by some poor catching on the field which has more or less compounded their problems.
Sri Lanka are a team struggling to find replacements for the likes of Sangakkara and Jayawardene and the players drafted in to replace them as well as Kusal Perera and Malinga have fallen short of the expected standards. Its all to do with the domestic system (both school and club) that is in place where Sri Lanka no longer produces the players in the caliber of its stars of the past.
Sri Lanka has only to take a leaf out of neighbour Indias book. See how quickly they have been able to replace the likes of Sehwag, Gambhir, Dravid, Tendulkar, Laxman, Zaheer Khan, and even Harbhajan Singh (although he is still a part of the present team) to name a few with players like Rohit Sharma, Shikhar Dhawan, Cheteshwar Pujara, Virat Kohli, Ajinkya Rahane, Ravichandran Ashwin, Mohammed Shami, Umesh Yadav and Ravindra Jadeja in their Test and one-day teams. Many believe that India is able to churn out such outstanding talent largely due to the IPL which allows newcomers to mix with top overseas cricketers and coaches and learn to improve their cricket. But that is only one part of it, the other is that India has a very strong domestic program (which is not tampered with constantly as it is in Sri Lanka) where the Ranji trophy, Irani trophy and Duleep trophy tournaments provide a strong base to nurture Test cricketers, and the NKP Salve Challenge trophy, Vijay Hazare trophy, Deodhar trophy and the BCCI Corporate trophy tournaments provide the feeder to the ODI teams.
No matter whom you bring in as coach (he maybe the best in the world) if the system cannot provide players of quality and class there is very little that he can do. The national team is as good as what is fed into it and if it is of low quality the results would also be similar.
