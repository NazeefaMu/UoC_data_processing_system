Sena looms over many districts
Sena caterpillar has been invading a high number of maize cultivation in Mahiyanganaya, Ridimaliyadda, Dabana and Wewatta in the Badulla District now, Badulla District Agriculture Director Ayesa Gunawardena said.
She was speaking at the District Agriculture Meeting held at the Badulla District Secretariat recently.
She urged farmers to inform the relevant Agriculture Assistant Researcher and the Agriculture Instructors no sooner than the farmer noticed the caterpillar in their cultivation as it can destroy a large maize cultivation completely in a few days.
The pesticides recommended by the Agriculture Department should be spread in lands where the invasion is seen, she said. Since the caterpillar spreads rapidly, destroying it, is very difficult, she said. Three recommended pesticides must be used to fully control the menace and one chemical must be used only once, she said.
Sena invaded Sri Lanka from India in May last year and now it has destroyed maize cultivation in Ampara, Anuradhapura, Kurunegala, and Moneragala.
It has destroyed crops in Hasalaka, Ulpathagama, Wilgamuwa, Doluwa and Valapane in the Central Province as well, she said.
If the Sena was not controlled in its initial stage, it could destroy not only maize but paddy, sugar cane, cabbage, beetroot, tomatoes and hundreds of other crops, she said.

A high number of patients come to the Dambulla Weera Densil Kobbekaduwa Hospital daily seeking treatment but the Emergency Treatment Unit (ETU) at the hospital provides its service only for six hours per day.
Therefore many patients who visit the hospital undergo severe difficulties since they have to return many a time to consult doctors. The unit was opened 15 years ago and in its initial stage, it was open for 12 hours. However, the duration was cut short since the unit lacks enough staff, hospital sources said.
Hospital welfare society sources said that if the unit works systematically, the number of patients admitted to the hospital can be reduced. The hospital management said the shortage of doctors and nurses results in reducing the number of hours that the unit opens.
The Welfare Association sources said relevant authorities must take steps to extend the number of hours that the unit opens per day as soon as possible since the issue causes severe difficulties to the public.

Environmentalist says use paddy husk ash against Sena
Farmers can control spreading Sena caterpillar in two weeks by using Paddy husks (dhaiya) founder of the Sobadahama Farm, environmentalist Tilak Kandegama said.
He was addressing a press briefing in Sigiriya yesterday. Sena has been invading many cabbage and maize cultivations for two years now, he said. It now has become a menace since the relevant department has not taken steps to control the threat.
The department now attempts to destroy male species of Sena but it is futile, he said. It is allergic to the ash of paddy husks and farmers must spread the ash in the morning in their cultivations for about two weeks to make the caterpillar disappear from their lands, he said.
Kandegama said the Agriculture Minister should pay attention to this issue and encourage farmers to spread dahiya ash in their cultivations. The paddy husks are available from paddy mills as much as they need but the farmers must be provided with transportation, he said.
Kandegama said Agriculture Department officials are trying to control the menace with chemicals but indigenous methods are available to resolve the issue in a few days.

Fears for more tsunamis after many killed in Indonesia
At least 222 people were killed, with hundreds more injured and missing, including members of a pop band, after a tsunami hit the coastline of west Java and Sumatra, Indonesia.
More deadly tsunamis could strike the Indonesian coastline in the coming days, authorities warn, as the volcano which triggered the weekend's devastating wave continues to erupt.
At least 281 people have died from the tsunami, which struck the Indonesian coastline without warning Saturday night. Hundreds more are injured and more than two dozen remain missing.
Eyewitnesses described fleeing for their lives as beachfront homes were swept away in the wave, which is thought to have been caused by underwater landslides following the eruption of the Anak Krakatau volcano.
According to media, the wave reached as high as three meters (10 feet).
Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, a spokesman at Indonesia's National Disaster Mitigation Agency, warned Sunday that more tsunamis were possible as long as the volcano remained active.
"We are cautioning the people to remain cautious," Sutopo said. "Agencies are still continuing to analyze the root cause,the Krakatau volcano continues to erupt, which could potentially trigger another tsunami." - (Sources:CNN News)

Global oil price reduction to benefit people - Finance and Media Ministry
As a result of the price formula introduced by the Government, the price of petrol and diesel has been reduced by Rs.30 and Rs.20 per litre respectively when compared with the last price increase on October 10, 2018.
Therefore the Government stresses that the bus fares and the charges in the transport sectors such as, three wheelers and school vehicles should be reduced proportionately in order to pass the benefits of the global fuel price reduction to the people.
Accordingly, the Government expects the regulatory institutions which are responsible for the transport sector would take necessary action to ensure that the benefits of the fuel price reduction passed on to the passengers.
At the same time, fisheries and other transport sectors should also pass on the benefit of fuel price reduction to the people as the production and transport costs of such sectors have declined following the decrease of diesel price. This would create a tendency of reducing the prices of goods and services thereby helping to cut the cost of living effectively.
When Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera presented the Vote on Account for the first four months of the year 2019 last Friday (December 21) in Parliament, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe announced that the fuel prices would be reduced effective midnight last Friday.
Accordingly, the fuel prices which were revised based on the fuel pricing formula. A litre of Octane 92 patrol has been reduced by Rs.10 to Rs.125 from Rs.135 while a litre of Octane 95 has been reduced by Rs.10 to Rs.149 from Rs.159. A litre of auto diesel has been reduced by Rs.5 to Rs.101 from Rs.106 while a litre of super diesel has been reduced by Rs.10 to Rs.121 from Rs.131.
The Cabinet of Ministers had approved on May, 2018 the introduction of a fuel price formula to decide the fuel prices in the local market based on the price fluctuation of crude oil in the Singapore market. Since then, the Treasury followed that the fuel price formula and reviewed the global fuel price fluctuation on the 10th of each month. The Treasury used the then prevailing price of a barrel of crude oil in the Singapore market in this practice.
The global prices of crude oil were continuously on the rise in the recent past and consequently the fuel prices in Sri Lanka too increased until October 10th. The fuel price in Sri Lanka was increased for the last time on October 10th and at the that time the global price of a barrel of crude oil was reported as US$85.
However, global price of crude oil was continusouly reduced from the month of November 2018 and the average global price of crude oil is currently reported as US$58 per barrel. Accordingly, the price of a litre of Octane 92 that prevailed as Rs.155 on October 10, 2018 has been reduced by Rs.30 to Rs.125 while a litre of Octane 95 that has been reduced by Rs.20 to Rs.149 from Rs.169.
In addition, the price of a litre of auto diesel that prevailed as Rs.123 on October 10, 2018 has been reduced by Rs.22 to Rs.101 while a litre of super diesel has been reduced by Rs.20 to Rs.121 from Rs.141 by today.

LAUGFS looking at expanding globally
LAUGFS has been always looking at innovation diversification and new markets and this was the key to the company being one of the largest diversified business conglomerates and a trusted name in Sri Lanka, said the Founder and the Executive Chairman of Laugfs Holdings Limited Founded in 1995, W. K. H. Wegapitiya.
Wegapitiya in an interview with Daily News Business said that they started their business ventures by launching Auto Gas for motor vehicles and this was a major success. This gave us confidence to move forward following it up with similar ventures and diversifications in LP gas, super markets, petroleum, solar energy, leisure and bunkering.
He recalled that when they moved in to the local LP gas market, the monopoly was with the multinational company, Shell. However we took the challenge and launched Laugfs as a true Sri Lankan company and today our products have become a house hold name.
In the year 2001, when the government of Sri Lanka decided to liberalize the LPG industry, LAUGFS Gas commenced its operations as a humble limited liability company, with an intention of becoming the second fully-fledged LPG downstream player in Sri Lanka.
In the year 2010, the company, having consolidated itself as the second player in the LPG industry decided to go public and accordingly initiated Initial Public Offering (IPO), inviting the general public to become a partner in the next level of development of the company.
Today LAUGFS stand as a public-quoted business entity at the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) with the participation of the general public as share holders from every corner of Sri Lanka.
Today LAUGFS holds one of the state-of-the-art storage and filling facility at Mabima about 15km away from Colombo. The LAUGFS plant is capable of holding 3000 metric tons of LPG at any given time. Currently plans are underway to increase the capacity to 4000 metric tons by year 2017.
He said that it was the large population and investor friendly policies that first attracted them to move to commence LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh Limited and introduce LP gas to the country.
PetredecElpiji Limited was renamed as LAUGFS Gas (Bangladesh) Limited in 2015 after its acquisition by LAUGFS Gas PLC of Sri Lanka, and has since expanded rapidly to become one of the largest LPG downstream players in the Bangladesh market.
Recently we commissioned our newest cylinder requalification plant at its terminal facility in Mongla, Khulna.
Operating a world-class LPG import, bottling and distribution facility in the Mongla Port, LAUGFS Gas Bangladesh imports and distributes over 60,000 metric tonnes of LPG in the country.
As part of our expansion plans to strengthen our presence as a regional energy conglomerate, we have a strong focus on the Bangladesh market. The new state-of-the-art cylinder requalification facility is an important milestone in this journey. It will also enable us to serve the Bangladesh market with the safest LPG cylinders, he said.
We see tremendous potential in the Bangladesh LPG market and will continue to invest to strengthen our operations there, he said.
He also said that to strengthen their energy operation they also acquired several ships and also opened its LPG storage complex at the Hambantota Port. Laugfs has plans to bring LPG in larger vessels from international markets like the Gulf, US, Singapore, to Hambantota.
We believe that the port operators connection to an international brand name like Chinas CMPort is something the local industry can leverage on.
Wegapitiya said that the world is moving away from old-fashioned ideas and instead of nations wanting full control of their own enterprises they are leveraging what they have to attract the right partners, to create synergies that would help them to move forward.
He also said to meet the demands of the leisure sector, they opened two built hotels in Anantaya Chilaw and Passikudah resort and they have invested over Rs.4.5 billion for this.
He said that they shelved their plans for the real estate sector so far and said that they are keen to move to the pharmaceutical business with the manufacturing of saline. We are awaiting further approvals from government to go ahead with this project.
He also said that the country needs long-term policies and consistent tax structure so that they could plan out their strategies well in advance.
Our teams including Managing Director, Thilak De Silva works tirelessly to strengthen our footprint in Sri Lanka and beyond as a trusted conglomerate. We are looking for more opportunities in Myanmar, Africa and the region.
The company today has expanded across 20 industries, establishing a strong presence as a leader and pioneer in the power and energy, consumer retail, industrial, services, leisure and logistics in Sri Lanka and beyond. With over 4,000 employees and an annual turnover exceeding Rs. 37 billion, LAUGFS continues to expand and empower millions as a trusted Sri Lankan brand.

Matale teachers take students for a ride
Students of Matale State schools face many second-hand treatments if they do not attend private classes that their teachers conduct in the town, members of parents associations in Matale said.
Some teachers condemn students who do not attend private classes in front of other students, parents say. State school teachers conduct private classes at different locations in the town for one subject and when they ask students to attend their classes, the students are in dilemma as to how they can fulfill their teachers demand.
The parents said the teachers use State schools for their marketing purposes and utterly neglect their duty towards the students and society.
Matale educational authorities turn a blind eye to this issue and that resulted in degenerating the educations of State schools in the area, they said.

Mexico breaks record for largest X'mas tree made with recycled materials
Aguascalientes breaks record for largest tree made with recycled materials.
Students collected 100,000 plastic bottles for the 27.84-meter tree.
Primary and secondary school students in the city of Aguascalientes collected close to 100,000 plastic bottles over the last seven weeks which were then used to create the tallest Christmas tree in the world made with recycled materials.
The record was sanctioned by Guinness World Records and its representative in Latin America, Carlos Tapia Rojas, who measured the tree and officially declared it to be 27.84 meters tall.
The plastic collected by students at more than 70 schools, in collaboration with the beverage company Coca-Cola, was used by 120 municipal public works staff to create a structure that, once finished, resembled a Christmas tree.
Following the same theme, the tree was then decorated by municipal staff who reused materials such as cardboard and metal.

Passengers stranded without extra trains for festive season
A large number of long-distance commuters were heavily inconvenienced during the weekend due to the lack of trains from Colombo Fort and Mt. Lavinia.
Although it was a long weekend, the Railway Department had not scheduled any extra trains for long-distance terminals such as Badulla, Jaffna and Kankasanturai, and Batticoloa.
The usual trains to these terminals were crowded and it resulted in many passengers facing difficulties and travelling on footboard.
Long queues formed in front of the ticket counters at the main stations. Some passengers were unable to get on the trains although they had purchased tickets after being in the queue from early morning.
At some stations such as Ragama, Polgahawela and Maho, Railway security had to be summoned to control the situation.
However, this situation was highly criticised not only by the passengers, but also by Railway workers.
Locomotive drivers and guards who did not wish to be named said there were many passengers who couldnt get on the trains. Trains had to run late due to this situation. According to them, extra compartments could have been added to some long-distance trains to ease the situation.
A Station Master speaking to the Daily News said it would be better if some extra trains were run during the festive season.
Some trains were delayed at the station by nearly 20 minutes. This situation was experienced, not only during the weekend, but from Friday night.
Passengers said they were in the queues from the early morning, but it was very difficult to get on to the trains. This is the festive season and with the Unduwap Poya falling on Saturday, the Sripada season too has started. It is also the school vacation.
The lack of extra train services during this period was not only a difficulty for passengers, but also a huge loss of income for the countrys most popular transport service.
Railways General Manager Dilantha Fernando confirmed that no special trains have been deployed so far for the festive season.
But, considering the prevailing congestion, only a few ad-hoc solutions were provided by deploying an extra train to Nanu Oya and attaching three extra compartments to the Rajarata Rajina express train.
Lack of sufficient resources including drivers on duty during this season has been the reason for this situation, he said.
We wish to bring this to the attention of the Transport Minister, Railway General Manager and relevant authorities on behalf of inconvenienced passengers.

President exhorts Ministry Secretaries to work diligently
All of you who received appointments as Ministry Secretaries for the second time within a matter of two months have my blessings and good wishes. I wish you all strength and ability to carry out your duties and responsibilities properly. I will always stand by you personally, as well as in my capacity as President when you perform those duties properly, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
The President was speaking to newly appointed Secretaries to Ministries at the Presidential Secretariat on Friday.
We need a good state administration. You have a clear understanding of the countrys political and economic environment and the social background. Our main target is to build a disciplined society and build a country devoid of poverty, the President said.
The twin challenges before us are elimination of poverty and building a disciplined society. We are a team dedicated towards those principles. I had full confidence in you when I appointed you to these posts.
Although we had been regularly using the word yahapalanaya, we have still not reached that objective of good governance.
I trust that you will act in your ministries to achieve that objective. I trust that you will perform you duties and responsibilities notwithstanding any pressure or proposals for unethical activities. No one should try to safeguard anyone engaged in corruption or fraud. Any covert unethical activity will someday come to light and be discovered by the public. So let us dedicate ourselves towards good governance, the President said.
There is no need for me to remind you of your duties and responsibilities as a Ministry Secretary. Use your knowledge and experience and visit all departments and institutions coming under you purview once a month, have discussions with staff to offer them encouragement, and do everything possible to improve their efficiency. Even certain Ministers warmed their chairs without visiting the institutions under their purview.
When I was Agriculture Minister, I used to visit my departments and institutions unannounced and I used to inquire about the problems that officers, the office cadre and those visiting the institutions faced. I also inquired into files that were piled up and outstanding work. I have this practice even today.
When I went to certain sections when I was Agriculture Minister, some computer screens displayed certain unpalatable things which could not be described. But a person who saw those officials from a distance thought they were busy with official work.
As such, staff in various institutions and departments should be given encouragement to do hard work by explaining matters to them. Failure to have a dialogue with staff breeds suspicion. So I trust that you all can do some good work by attending to any shortcomings.
I wish you and the country a Happy Christmas and a bright and prosperous New Year.
