Crossed over members have no political future
The 16 member group of SLFP Parliamentarians who crossed over to the Joint Opposition have no political future, said Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijeyalal de Silva. Addressing a meeting of SLFP activists held at his Ambalangoda Polwatta residence, the Chief Minister said a person indulging in politics should work according to a common agenda rather than personal agendas.
People who worked according to personal agendas had no future in politics. The Chief Minister said, a true party man or woman would stand by the party and its leadership through thick and thin. Except in the case of late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike all those who broke away from mainstream parties had no future. Only late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike was able to establish himself after breaking away from his party. A large number of people who left the SLFP including late Anura Bandaranaike and Maithripala Senanayake who broke away from the SLFP thought the party would be ruined after their departure but then were proved wrong.
Late Prime Minister S. W. R. D. Bandaranaikes daughter and son-in-law also broke away from the SLFP. Although the party suffered a temporary setback at that instance it revived after a short period of time.
The Chief Minister said the sixteen SLFP members who broke away from government ranks disliked a majority of Joint opposition members. The public too disliked them.
It was the people who ultimately decided the future of politicians. President Maithripala Sirisena had already announced that he had no intention to retire from politics after the completion of his present term. It was the situation during the 2015 Presidential election which led him to announce that he would retire after his first term.
He made that announcement as a common candidate.
Subsequently he started participating in SLFP meetings. Now he had to bow his head and agree to requests made by party activists.
This may have led him to rethink about retiring from politics.
President Maithripala Sirisena was the only leader who could stand for election above racial or religious bias. President Maithripala Sirisena is the only leader who established democracy in the SLFP once again, he said.

Govt. created a media - friendly environment
Investigations could be launched if the New York Times journalists, who were said to be threatened for furnishing a report concerning former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, lodge a complaint, Public Administration, Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
He said so addressing the media at the Ministry auditorium yesterday.
The Minister added that an impartial investigation could be launched into such allegations if the said journalists lodge a complaint with the Police.
Minister Bandara noted that during the reign of the last regime ie before 2015, around 25 journalists were assaulted or killed by the white van culture of the then government. According to the Minister, no journalist had been assaulted or killed under this government, unlike the former regime. Journalists have been granted total freedom and opportunity to perform their duties impartially with dignity. No incidents of threatening, killing or assaulting had ever been reported since 2015 under this government, he said.
The Minister added that this was the only government which was able to maintain a media friendly environment for nearly four years.
Meanwhile, the Minister seeks the assistance of the media to do away with organised crime, drug trafficking, underworld movements and other unruly acts.

I think she paved the way for Meghan and Harry' Intro::: The Crowns Vanessa Kirby says Princess Margarets attempt to marry divorcee Peter Townsend blazed the trail for future royal romances
Her portrayal of Princess Margaret in hit drama The Crown won her a BAFTA award, with her reenacting the royal's pain at being denied permission to marry divorcee Peter Townsend perfectly.
And Vanessa Kirby has opened up about her role in the series, admitting that Margaret may have paved the way for Prince Harry to marry Meghan Markle, who was subjected to much judgement for having a previous marriage.
The Wimbledon-born actress, 30, also admitted that she won the nickname 'Bambi' behind the scenes for her clumsiness and cried at the end of the season, in an honest interview as she posed for Marie Claire's cover this month.
Speaking about Princess Margaret, whose sister Queen Elizabeth II denied her permission to marry the love of her life as he had previously been married, Vanessa said: 'I cant help but think she did [pave the way for Meghan and Harry].
She continued: Margaret knew when she got involved with Peter Townsend that her family wouldnt approve, and yet she wasnt going to give up. I think she was trying to modernise the royal family from the inside and make it better for people later on.
'I heard she was still very bitter about it 20 years on. That really informed how I wanted to play her because if youre bitter [years later] about somebody else being able to marry [a divorcee], it suggests your wound is very deep.
Revealing that she joked with Helena Bonham-Carter about 'passing on the baton', Vanessa admitted that she feared her career had 'peaked' with the role.
She also told how her clumsiness behind the scenes and tendency to burn cigarette holes in costumes earned her the nickname Bambi, revealing that the opulent diamonds used to film were in fact all plastic as 'she could not be trusted'.
Recalling how she was filming scenes with Tom Cruise, Vanessa told how kissing scenes soon sparked real life romance rumours, with boyfriend (actor War & Peace actor Callum Turner) being contacted by worried friends.
Vanessa previously spoke to The Daily Mail about the rumours she was 'engaged' to Tom Cruise to quash the ludicrous reports.
She explained: Theres literally zero truth in it. Ive been in a relationship for two years! The rumours came out after Id met Tom, once, in a roomful of people.
Speaking about her boyfriend, who she has been dating for over two years, she added: 'We hadnt started filming, and all of a sudden were getting married! Its so bizarre. My boyfriend found it hilarious.

Race against rain to save Thai boys
THAILAND: Thai rescuers on Thursday said they may be prodded into a complex extraction of 12 boys and their football coach from a flooded cave if forecast rains hammer the mountainside and jeopardise the rescue mission. Thirteen sets of diving equipment have been prepared for the team, who have endured 12 nights underground in the Tham Luang cave complex in northern Thailand.
Water is being pumped out from the deluged cave round-the-clock, reducing the flooding by one centimetre an hour. But with rain forecast to begin on Friday, the Chaing Rai provincial governor helming the unprecedented rescue effort conceded the mission was now a race against the water.
Our biggest concern is the weather. We are calculating how much time we have if it rains, how many hours and days, Narongsak Osottanakorn told reporters, without providing further details.
In a sign of increased urgency, Narongsak said medics and Thai navy SEAL divers are assessing whether the boys are fit and well enough to be taken out early -- apparently softening his instance on Wednesday that no risk will be taken with the evacuation.
The prospect of the stranded team diving out is fraught with risk.
It takes seasoned cave diving experts around six hours to reach the muddy ledge where the boys are sheltering.
Many of the youngsters -- who are aged between 11-16 -- are unable to swim and none have diving experience.
Thai navy SEAL experts are teaching them the basics of diving. But the areas where diving is still necessary are tight and may require the boys to swim through murky waters unaccompanied.
In a two-pronged strategy, cavers are also hunting for a chimney down to the boys, creating a potential second option for evacuation in the event heavy rains force their hand.
Authorities still hope they can manage any fresh deluge, with high-powered pumps draining 128 million litres (34 million gallons) of water so far from the cave in a round-the-clock effort.
We are draining as much as we can, said Khao Khieupakdi a a Bangkok disaster prevention official, seconded to northern Thailand like scores of other specialists.
Water has been cleared from the entrance to a rescue base camp in chamber three inside the cave, but onward sections towards the boys remain impassable without diving, he said.
I am concerned as the forecast said is for more rain.
Concerns for the mental and physical health of the boys are mounting after a prolonged ordeal in the dark, claustrophobic cave complex.
Experts say the risk of psychological damage is high for youngsters trapped in traumatic conditions, while the lack of light may cause confusion.
British cave divers found the emaciated and dishevelled group on Monday, huddled on a muddy shelf with flood waters lapping ominously below, after nine days missing.
Several Thai navy divers and medics are staying with them and fresh video footage released on Wednesday showed the group in seemingly good spirits.
They cannot do anything... they have to save energy, army Major General Bancha Duriyaphan.
They are chit-chatting in general. Talking, eating and sleeping, he said.

Stop charging cooperatives 10 percent from profits
Uva Provincial Councillor M.P. Leelasena called for the cessation of the 10 percent charged by the Cooperative Development Department from the profits of cooperative societies. He stressed many are running at a loss and this charge simply put them into greater debt.
The consumer units of these cooperatives have completely broken down. The majority of cooperative outlets have been closed. The remaining cooperatives survive because of the fuel stations and the cooperative banks. Can the cooperatives survive in an open economy We should ask ourselves this question. We have to admit that the open economy principles of the UNP government after 1977 led to the decline of the cooperatives. It is difficult to rebuild them now, he said.
He said the Badulla multi-purpose cooperative, for example, paid Rs. 3 - Rs. 4 million to the Fund every year, but now it was in debt amounting to Rs. 20.6 million to the Fund. From the Uva Province alone, the Fund collects Rs. 10 million every year. But the Fund did not spend a cent on the welfare of these cooperatives. The officers of the Department, however, take frequent trips abroad and enjoy many benefits. The cooperatives fall into ruin. Our cooperatives today owe more than Rs 50 million to the Fund.
He said it was unfair to collect 10 percent of the profits for the Fund and asked for a more reasonable percentage. It was through the profits that 742 employees were paid their salaries. He asked that this 10 percent charge be stopped in order to save the struggling cooperatives.
If so, we can save that Rs 10 million and use it for the benefit of the cooperatives.
The Provincial Councillor said that in accordance with the 13th Amendment to the Constitution, cooperatives come under the purview of the provincial councils. We can form our own Fund and use that money for the benefit of the cooperatives and their families, said Leelasena.

Prime Minister tells Parliament
Our Govt. was never pressurised to handover H'tota port to China"
The Rajapaksa regime borrowed $1320 million from the Chinese government for the construction of the Hambantota Port, but the Port Authority or the government did not have the ability to bring in ships to this port, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said. The Prime Minister was making a Special Statement in Parliament yesterday on the New York Times investigative report.
The government did not have the means or income to pay back this loan for a port that had no ships coming in. With no income the Colombo port had to shoulder the burden of the Hambantota port. From 2011 to date the losses from the Hambantota Port is around Rs. 47 billion, the Prime Minister Ranil said.
Finding a solution to this issue was an election pledge of the Good Governance government. We had only two options, one was to determine that this agreement was unlawful and take the necessary action and the other was to discuss the matter with the Chinese government.We gave priority to the second option of discussing the matter and taking a decision. We discussed on how best to transform this white elephant into a profit making venture. Our motive was to turn this into a public private partnership which could generate revenue and get us out of the debt trap, the Prime Minister added.
Responding to allegations in the New York Times that the Good Governance government was forced by China, he said: I state with responsibility that our government was never pressurised by the Chinese government to hand over the port to them. We had many options and we could have followed whatever we wanted. They only requested us to initially call for proposals from Chinese companies. In response, we called for open tenders and the most profitable from those we received was from China Harbour Merchant Company. Their proposal was to create an industrial zone and they had the capability to bring in ships. They agreed on a $1080 million investment.
Based on the agreement, on December 20, 2017 $ 293 million was paid to Sri Lanka and on January 28, 2018 $ 97 million was paid and the balance $ 584 million was paid to the Port Authority. A development plan for the setting up of an industrial zone has been completed and an LNG power plant has been approved.
The Prime Minister noted that several other investment applications had also been received by the Investment Board, adding that this was a great victory for the current government to be able to transform a shipless port into a productive port.
There has not been a sale of the harbour in any manner. Only the port operations would be carried out by a PPP.
The Hambantota harbour will transform into a developed harbour in the future. This harbour would definitely not be used for any war situation and we will not allow our lands nor ports to be used for any military or war purposes of any other country. This has been clearly stated in the agreement and we have also emphasized this point to the Chinese President and he had accepted it, the Premier asserted.
With regard to the Mattala Airport, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe noted that initial discussions were held with the Chinese companies, but, not having a positive response, we are now in discussion with Indian companies.
I am confident that we would be able to transform the Mattala Airport into a profit making airport which brings in many aircraft. If China had pressured us, then we would have been compelled to hand over Mattala to them too. Sri Lanka negotiates and deals with India and China as an independent state, the Prime Minister assured.
JO  MP Wimal Weerawansa said that despite the handing over of the Hambantota harbour to China Merchant and the government receiving payment for it, the Port Authority was still paying the loan repayment instalments, bearing the debt burden.
In response, the Prime Minister said: This money had been deposited in our reserves and no matter who pays, the money is with us. Our debt has reduced and our reserves have appreciated. The New York Times article had two parts and I only responded to the part that was relevant to my government.

Essam Bin Abdulla Khalaf, in order to broach and discuss significant and decisive developments in the sphere of his vast portfolio in order to secure more skilled employment opportunities to Sri Lankan nationals.

He further added that many Sri Lankan engineers, IT professionals, quantity surveyors, technical officers and accountants are employed in the Ministry and are much liked by other colleagues, both from Bahrain and from other countries.
Minister corroborated that the Sri Lankan skilled professionals are much admired because of their commitment, integrity and competency. Both the Minister and the Ambassador agreed that for economic advancement and to attract foreign direct investments and institutional investments, it is imperative to have a highly conducive and competitive infrastructure in the country.
The Minister said that in the context of the highly comprehensive and complex National Strategic Master Plan of Bahrain 2030, a number of employment opportunities for qualified and skilled professionals are available in his Ministry.

Both the Minister and Ambassador underscored the significance of any given country to have an advanced and developed infrastructure, in all spheres, to be a rapidly developing economy leading to an advanced economy. Minister accentuated the fact that an efficacious road network could lead to development of the entire region or area with economic and commercial activity and most importantly, the connectivity.

Brathwaite ton helps Windies turn the screw
Antigua and Barbuda, Thursday:Kraigg Brathwaite completed a seventh Test century as the West Indies turned the screws on Bangladesh on the second day of the first Test in Antigua on Thursday.
The Windies reached 271 for three in reply to the tourists first innings total of 43 at lunch at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium.
They resume in the afternoon session with the phlegmatic opener unbeaten on 121 in partnership with Shai Hope (14 not out) and the home side already ahead by 128 runs with eight first innings wickets in hand.
Under no pressure to accelerate the game after Kemar Roach had led the pacers demolition of the tourists for their lowest Test innings total ever on day one, Brathwaite progressed at a snails pace on the second morning. He added 33 runs in two hours play with the West Indies advancing overall by 70 runs from their overnight position of 201 for two. Nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo was the lone casualty for the hosts as he was bowled by Kamrul Islam for 19 after yet again making an important contribution in support of the senior batsman.
Their third-wicket partnership was worth 52 runs and Brathwaite reached the century landmark along the way via a rare expression of aggression in slashing a short, wide delivery from Kamrul to the backward point boundary.
His innings of almost seven hours has so far occupied 289 deliveries, embellished with 11 fours. None of the Bangladeshi seamers have so far been able to come even close to replicating Roachs outstanding effort on day one. AFP

Capt. A V Rajendra heads SLANA
The second AGM of Sri Lanka Association of NVOCC Agents (SLANA) was held on June 26, 2018 at the Mont Blanc, Movenpick Hotel, with Dr. Nandalal Weerasinghe Deputy Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka as chief guest.
Sujeiva Samaraweera, Chairman National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka also participated for this event as a key speaker.
SLANA Chairman Capt. A V Rajendra, among other issues highlighted the fact that the Ceylon Shipping Corporation which currently does not own any container ships should pursue to become the strongest NVOCC operator in the region.
He also said that, for NVOCCs to be attracted to the port of Colombo, the regulation on the restrictions of the recovery of THC should abolished without any further delay.
SLANA was formed in the year 2016 for a few specific reasons; to gain due recognition for its members, to address the issues faced by its members, to protect the interest of its members, to keep the members informed of various rules and regulations or amendments to the existing practices introduced by the state or other relevant institutions, to promote education and training and most importantly to facilitate and promote NVO trade and businesses through the port of Colombo, he said.
Unlike in distant past, SLANA members are now able to readily comply and adhere to industry requirements with the assistance of SLANA Secretariat as there wasnt a professional body to represent NVOCC Agents prior to the formation of SLANA. NVOs are a dominant force in the Indian Sub-continent, West Asia and South East Asia and its presence is vital for the Sri Lankan trade. It had to be harnessed and promoted for the benefit of the trade.
NVOCC agencies belong to the SME sector. Their growth can be strengthened by the legislators and policy makers, he said.
In view of the above we are thankful to the Minister of Ports and Shipping and the Chairman of Sri Lanka Ports Authority Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake for recognizing the importance of NVOCCs by giving NVOCCs a place in the proposed Maritime Policy document. The Appointment of Chairmanship of the SLPA, a knowledgeable personality from the maritime industry, is always helpful because of the necessity to understand the needs and importance of the service providers and their contribution to this niche trade, he said.
The maritime industry realized the importance of the NVOCCs few years ago only when major shipping lines withdrew their services from certain ports in view of the economic sanctions imposed by the UN on those countries. Our exporters were left stranded and NVOCCs stood by the exporters to export their cargoes to those countries. A couple of years thereafter, due to some haphazard decisions taken by the legislators and policy makers on shore based cost recoveries including Terminal Handling Charges, the businesses of service providers along with NVOs were hampered. NVO Principals began to look at Colombo as a negative destination, he said.
Imposition of UN sanctions on certain countries cannot be ruled out in the near future and once again NVOCCs support may be called upon by the trade for its exports with the possibility of shipping lines withdrawal from these countries. NVOCCs must be supported and encouraged with a level playing field as is in the region, to allow and permit to recover shore based costs which are currently being prevented by so called regulations. SLANA is prepared to standby the Sri Lanka shippers and exporters by ignoring the shore based costs including the Terminal Handlings Charges for the benefit of the exporters and country, but it will be only viable if the overall blanket prohibition of recovery on shore based costs is lifted to sustain their businesses in Sri Lanka, or otherwise the eagerness of NVOCCs doing business in Sri Lanka will always remain doubtful, he said.
As a nation Sri Lanka is on the world map for container operations. The Sri Lanka Ports Authority together with the Private Terminals are doing a great job in making the port of Colombo a leading port in the world, mainly with the container volume throughput of major Shipping Lines. Other ports while vying hard to achieve the same, aggressively promote NVOCCs and multi-country consolidations which bring in tremendous revenue to a country, he added.

Cat care essentials
How you identify a diseased cat
Cats are lovable animals often very lazy as all other members of the feline family. Diseased cats can be dull looking with unhealthy fur coat. Main signs of a sick cat are loss of appetite, unable to walk or limping, loose motion or constipation, vomiting, eye or nasal secretions, difficult breathing and rashes or wounds in the skin.
How to restrain a cat in disease situation
Cats dont like unfavourable situations. Also they sometimes get furious if somebody disturbs them when they are sick. They normally escape and get lost, not allowing people to handle or treat them. Therefore handling a sick cat in a proper way is very important to make the cat comfortable. It also helps the cat to get relieve of the disease in a peaceful manner. Always keep a sick cat in enclosed area/room while examining and handling.
When the cats are afraid and uncomfortable they try to bite and scratch by claws. It is better to cover the face facilitating normal breathing of the cat as unseen handlings do not make them afraid. Also claws can be covered with a towel to prevent scratching. Holding he cat from its cuff area also make then clam. In addition both the hind limbs can be hold by one hand of the handler while slightly stretching the cats body to control them especially treating the animal.
How to care for a diseased cat
Cats love warm places. Therefore its a strict thumb rule to keep them warm when they are sick. Warm water filled packs or warm water filled glass bottles can be kept around the cat to make it feel warm. Feeding liquid diets using a syringe is good. Always use a new syringe. Maximum precautions should be taken not to force feed or prevent aspiration. Therefore best way of entering the syringe to mouth is by the side. You can lift the lip and enter the food syringe in to the mouth and release the food slowly according to the swallowing pattern of the cat. Holding the animal from its cuff also facilitate the feeding.
Cats love walking or roaming outside for fresh air. But a sick cat should be kept in a room with restricted movements as much as possible. Peaceful environment should be established to be calmed and to facilitate quick recovery. Cats always love to clean and groom themselves. Therefore if the cat is unable to do so you have to groom them at least once daily. If the cat suffering from diarrhea, vomiting, etc the contaminations of the skin which make foul smelling. A wet cloth or a wet tissue can be use to clean the animal. Do not wash the cat as it makes the body temperature to be low.
Common cat diseases
As a cat parent, it is important to recognize the signs and symptoms of common illnesses so you can seek veterinary help for your feline friend in a timely manner if necessary.
Cancer
Cancer is a class of diseases in which cells grow uncontrollably, invade surrounding tissue and may spread to other areas of the body. As with people, cats can get various kinds of cancer. The disease can be localized (confined to one area, like a tumor) or generalized (spread throughout the body).
Diabetes
Diabetes in cats is a complex disease caused by either a lack of the hormone insulin or an inadequate response to insulin. After a cat eats, her digestive system breaks food into various components, including glucose which is carried into her cells by insulin. When a cat does not produce insulin or cannot utilize it normally, her blood sugar levels elevate. The result is hyperglycemia, which, if left untreated, can cause many complicated health problems for a cat.
Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV)
Cats infected with feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) may not show symptoms until years after the initial infection occurred. Although the virus is slow-acting, a cats immune system is severely weakened once the disease takes hold. This makes the cat susceptible to various secondary infections. Infected cats receiving supportive medical care and kept in a stress-free, indoor environment can live relatively comfortable lives for months to years before the disease reaches its chronic stages.
Feline Leukemia Virus (FelV)
First discovered in the 1960s, feline leukemia virus is a transmittable RNA retrovirus that can severely inhibit a cats immune system. It is one of the most commonly diagnosed causes of disease and death in domestic cats. Because the virus doesnt always manifest symptoms right away, any new cat entering a household and any sick cat should be tested for FeLV.
Heartworm
Spread by infected mosquitoes, heartworm is increasingly being recognized as an underlying cause of health problems in domestic cats. Cats are an atypical host for heartworms. Despite its name, heartworm primarily causes lung disease in cats. It is an important concern for any cat owner living in areas densely populated by mosquitoes, and prevention should be discussed with a veterinarian.
High-Rise Syndrome
Many pet parents eagerly open their windows to enjoy the weather during the summer months. Unfortunately, unscreened windows pose a real danger to cats, which fall out of them so often that the veterinary profession has a name for the complaint High-Rise Syndrome. Falls can result in shattered jaws, punctured lungs, broken limbs and pelvises and even death.
Rabies
Rabies is a viral disease that affects the brain and spinal cord of all mammals, including cats, dogs and humans. Theres good reason that the very word rabies evokes fear in people once symptoms appear, rabies is close to 100 per cent fatal.
Ringworm
Although the name suggests otherwise, ringworm isnt caused by a worm at all but a fungus that can infect the skin, hair and nails. Not uncommon in cats, this highly contagious disease can lead to patchy, circular areas of hair loss with central red rings.
Also known as dermatophytosis, ringworm often spreads to other pets in the household and to humans, too.
Upper Respiratory Infections
A cats upper respiratory tract (the nose, throat and sinus area) is susceptible to infections caused by a variety of viruses and bacteria.
Viruses are the most common causes of upper respiratory infections (URIs) in cats. Feline calicivirus and feline herpesvirus account for 80 to 90 per cent of all contagious upper respiratory problems, and are prevalent in shelters, catteries and multi-cat households. These viruses can be transmitted from cat to cat through sneezing, coughing, or while grooming or sharing food and water bowls.
Worms
Cats can acquire a variety of intestinal parasites, including some that are commonly referred to as worms.
Infestations of intestinal worms can cause a variety of symptoms. Sometimes cats demonstrate few to no outward signs of infection, and the infestation can go undetected despite being a potentially serious health problem. Some feline parasitic worms are hazards for human health as well.
Most of the diseases can be cured by prior vaccination at proper age. Always try to manage your cat with expert advice of a qualified veterinarian to keep the cat in a disease free condition.

Ceylon Chamber assists construction  of new houses for flood  affected families
The southwestern monsoons in Sri Lanka resulted in severe flooding and landslides throughout the country in 2016, as well as in 2017.
According to Disaster Management Center a total of 717,622 people belonging to 184,265 families were affected with close to 300 deaths due to the 2017 floods and landslides. While 2,313 houses were destroyed, a further 12,529 houses were partially damaged as a result of the floods. Bulathsinhala, Palindanuwara and Ingiriya DS Divisions of Kalutara District were the worst affected areas with 187,883 people from 50,482 families in the District affected with 65 reported deaths.
Therefore, the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce appealed for donations from members and well-wishers to help families affected in Bulathsinhala DS Divisions.
In response to the Chambers appeal, the CCC Disaster Relief Fund received donations worth Rs. 2.3 mn from member companies and well-wishers. The companies that made generous contributions towards this worthy cause include; Hemas Holdings Ltd., Finlays Colombo Ltd, Iluka Lanka Resources (PVT) Limited, Renuka Hotels Ltd. Renuka City Hotels, Trinushka Soysa and Mahen Dayananda, a past chairman of the Chamber.
The Chamber also contributed Rs. 1.4 mn for this worthy cause and decided to construct three houses for flood affected families, whose houses were completely destroyed during the floods.
After careful review of various options available, the Chamber decided to assist three flood affected families in Bulathsinhala DS Division to construct new houses on lands belonging to them.
The Government usually provides a model house of 575 square feet recommended by the National Building Research Organization (NBRO) to flood affected families. Therefore, the Chamber too decided to contribute Rs. 1,236,120/ for each family to construct a house based on the model house of NBRO.
Bulathsinhala Divisional Secretary and the staff of Secretariat along with three Grama Seva Niladharis supported the three affected families to obtain necessary approvals from NBRO and relevant Government Agencies and closely monitored the construction of houses from laying of foundation until completion of construction.
The Chamber staff after inspection of successful completion of each stage of construction released funds in three installments to complete construction of houses in an uninterrupted manner.
The three fully completed houses were handed over to the respective families at a simple house warming ceremony with the participation of Chamber staff, Bulathsinhala Divisional Secretary, Secretariat Staff, GSN and Development Officers of respective DS Divisions and two representative of Iluka Lanka Resources (PVT) Limited on June 25, 2018.
The three beneficiary families include; K R Inoka Udayangani of Ratiyala, Govinna, Kumudu Saman Perera of Galahitiyawa, Malkawa and L A Kumara Jayawansa of Udagalkanda, Delmalla.
All three families have been living in small houses made from wattle & daub and wooden planks before the floods. Inoka Udayangani was a widow with a young son and engaged in labour work for a living. Both Kumudu Saman as well as Kumara Jayawansa too make a living by engaged in menial labour work and peeling of cinnamon.
After their houses were fully damaged due to the floods, they were living in make-shift houses and temporary shelters provided by the Bulathsinhala DS.

For 2-Test series against South Africa:
Chandimal named captain pending ICC hearing
Sri Lanka named Dinesh Chandimal as captain for the upcoming two-Test series against South Africa despite the fact that he has a charge sheet hovering above his head for refusing to take the field on the third day of the second Test against West Indies at St Lucia after the umpires had informed the team that he had been charged with ball tampering.
The hearing to determine Chandimals punishment for the charge will be held on July 10, two days before the start of the first Test against South Africa at Galle. The Lankan captain had already served a one-Test ban for ball tampering.
We have named Dinesh as captain because at this stage he is free to play after having served a one-Test ban, said chief selector Graeme Labrooy.
We dont know how the punishment for the second charge will be. We are hoping that he will be slapped with a penalty and not suspended from matches.
The worst scenario for Sri Lanka will be if Chandimal is suspended from playing where the suspension can range between two to four Tests. In that event the selectors have taken the precaution of getting fast bowler Suranga Lakmal to captain the side.
LAKMALS POPULARITY AS CAPTAIN
Lakmal did an excellent job as captain leading the team to a series leveling win in the third and final Test against West Indies at Bridgetown by initiating early breakthroughs for his side that eventually ended up in a four-wicket win.
Lakmal has the highest respect from not only his team members but from the entire squad of players, said Labrooy. If there is a popularity contest amongst the players Lakmal would easily run out the winner.
Lakmal has been named vice-captain to Chandimal. This is the third series that he carries that tag having first being appointed for the tour to Bangladesh early this year and retaining it for the tour to West Indies.
Sri Lanka will gladly welcome the return of established opener Dimuth Karunaratne to the side. The southpaw had to forego the tour to the Caribbean after fracturing the index finger of his left hand at practice. However a tour to the Bangladesh as captain of the Sri Lanka A team where he came up with scores of 60 and 161 against Bangladesh A in the first four-day unofficial test at Chittagong last week confirmed that he had fully recovered from his injury as well his match fitness.
KUSAL MENDIS TO OPEN
The question here is who will open the batting with Karunaratne In his absence Sri Lanka struggled with their opening combinations in the Caribbean trying out as many as four players in that position.
We are looking at Kusal Mendis because the head coach feels that in subcontinent conditions he will be able to score heavily, said Labrooy.
As a stop gap opener in the first Test against West Indies at Port of Spain, Mendis scored a century in the second innings, but reverted back to the middle order for the rest of the series when Mahela Udawatte was selected to fill that slot partnering Kusal Perera. Udawatte had a rather poor series scoring two ducks in four innings and has been overlooked for the South African Tests.
Former captain Angelo Mathews returns to the Test side having returned home after just one Test in the Caribbean to attend to the birth of his second child.
There are no newcomers to the rest of the squad with the exception of Kusal Perera and Rangana Herath being named subject to fitness.
Kusal who suffered a side injury in the third Test against West Indies and Rangana who had sutures removed yesterday in the webbing between the fourth and fifth fingers of his right hand will both undergo fitness tests on July 9 and 10, said Labrooy who expressed confidence that they would pull through.
Sri Lanka play South Africa in the first Test at Galle from July 12-16 and second Test at SSC from July 20-24.

China Harbour Co was cleared of any wrongdoing - MR
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksas media unit in a statement said yesterday that China Harbour Co was cleared of any wrongdoing and all their projects had been restored by the government.
As for the money that is supposed to have been given for President Rajapaksas 2015 presidential election campaign by China Harbour Co, the present government did not suspend the activities of all Chinese Construction companies in Sri Lanka to check on their engineering credentials or their project experience, the former Presidents media unit said in a statement yesterday.
The statement went on to say that the only matter investigated was to see whether these companies had any improper dealings with members of the Rajapaksa government.
China Harbour Co was cleared of any wrongdoing and all their projects including the flagship Colombo Port City project, were restored to them. In last Tuesdays article, the NYT has once again said that the present government of Sri Lanka handed over the Hambantota port to China because they were unable to repay the loan taken to build it.
The reason why the NYT clings so doggedly to this idea despite President Rajapaksas explanation last Sunday, is probably to explain away the embarrassing fact that the Hambantota port was given to China by the very government that the Obama administration had spent hundreds of millions of Dollars to bring into power - as admitted by former US Secretary of State John Kerry in 2016,it added.

CILT Sri Lanka holds First Logistics Leaders Evening
The Chartered Institute of Logistics & Transport (CILT) Sri Lanka held its first Logistics Leaders Evening for the year on June 19, themed Future Challenges in Aviation.
The event was held at the Victorian Hall of The Kingsbury, Colombo and was attended by over 150 participants from a wide spectrum of the industry.
The eminent speakers for the evening were H. M. C. Nimalsiri, Director General of Civil Aviation and Chief Executive Officer, Civil Aviation Authority Sri Lanka; Johanne Jayaratne, Executive Director, Airport & Aviation Services Sri Lanka; Capt. Suren Ratwatte, Chief Executive Officer, SriLankan Airlines and Romesh David, Director, Cinnamon Air.
Chairperson CILT Sri Lanka, Gayani de Alwis, CMILT during her welcome address stressed that CILTs role is both passenger and goods transport in all modes of transport including aviation and urged all aviation professionals to engage with CILT to develop the industry. She also mentioned about CILTs collaborative education offering with SriLankan Aviation College.
Aside from the detailed overviews of the aviation industry as a whole, there were several common topics that were identified as challenges for the aviation industry and specifically Sri Lanka such as; the political instability and frequent policy changes, inadequate integration with other institutions for national level strategies, development of airport infrastructure lagging behind, travel growth resulting in traffic at Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) already exceeding planned capacity, ground handling rates at BIA being reported to be higher than those at other regional airports, etc.
However, some positive trends were also shared with global air travel numbers being better than ever before and that the Asia-Pacific region will dominate that growth.
Furthermore, the processing, sharing and distributing of data, be it internally to staff within an airport or direct to consumers, providing real-time updates on the weather, delayed aircraft  any issues in general are allowing for better communication all around and more effective strategy planning moving forward.
The theory is that the real-time updates integrated within an efficient management system are enabling reaction methods to real-time challenges to be drastically improved upon. What was most exciting were the insights into the future of the aviation industry such as Dubai airport to go passport-free with Blockchain Technology where inbound passengers will get off their flight and head to baggage claim, with the process of manual verification through waiting in queues eliminated.
Also single token travel, facial recognition technologies, biometrics  whichever name you choose for the topic will have a huge impact. Single token travel looks to become a staple of air travel in the very near future.
With extremely exciting developments such as the work Happy Flow is achieving at Aruba as well as releases at several of the major airports and airlines around the world all evidence the fact that there are significant investments in biometric technology everywhere.
The speeches were followed by a very interesting panel discussion moderated by Kamaya Perera, Principal, KPMG Sri Lanka  Knowledge Partner of CILT Sri Lanka.
The Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport (CILT) is the leading global professional body associated with the logistics and transport industry.
The Institute holds unparalleled international recognition and works towards achieving its objective of promoting, encouraging and coordinating the study of the science and art of logistics and transport through its membership, educational qualifications and other events.
With a global membership of over 34,000 from 34 countries across the globe, CILT provides a professional identity to those in the ever-expanding logistics and transport sector.
It is a strong, active and a unified professional association that is able to speak with authority on strategic issues affecting businesses and people in the industry and support their careers.

Good Governance at work
Re-appointment of JVP MP Sunil Handunneththi as the COPE Chairman, clearly indicates the clean and corrupt-free politics of Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna, the one and only exemplary political party which has almost all the corrupt-free, honest and peoplised true Sri Lankans.
Besides, I again appreciate the MP Dayasiri Jayasekara who proposed the name of the COPE Chairman, and my second thank goes to Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe for proposing the name of SLFP-Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanne for the post of Chairman of COPA (Committee on Public Accounts), at the recently held COPE meeting.
We, as general public in Sri Lanka are happy to mention that we clearly notice and experience that most often law courts, police stations and many other state institutions are functioning without any politicians interferences. The best example for this is that the Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasams urging the Chief Ministers of all Provinces to stop meddling with transferring, attaching and appointing principals to provincial schools. He has reportedly said that there are many politically appointed principals in schools and some of them, he says, influence parents to organize protests and demonstrations against administrative decisions.
Another good and exemplary service of the police is that the Arachchikattuwa Police, in Puttalam, arresting the son of minister (UNP) Palitha Range Bandara, who had caused heavy damages to a house when he was driving his vehicle under the influence of liquor.
We therefore salute this Yahapalana Government, as long as the Police and the other law-abiding institutes, that honestly and justly function without any political influences.

Colombo-Chittagong joint container ship feeder operation soon
The Ceylon Shipping Corporation Ltd (CSC) and Bangladesh Shipping Corporation (BSC) will enter into an agreement to establish a joint container ship feeder operation between the Port of Colombo and the Port of Chittagong.
In July 2017, President Maithripala Sirisena, during his official visit to Bangladesh, signed a MoU between Sri Lanka and Bangladesh to work together on container ship feeder operations.
Due to its limitations in port facilities and limited depth, the Port of Chittagong does not have vessels of Main Line Operators (MLOs) call there. Instead, many are diverted to either Colombo, Singapore or Malaysia.
In the meantime, under the Flag Protection Ordinance of Bangladesh, ships of BSC enjoy priority berthing facilities at the Port of Chittagong. Under the present MoU, this priority berthing facility can be obtained for CSC vessels registered under the Sri Lanka Flag.
The Cabinet paper submitted by Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe pointed out that this agreement could have a competitive advantage to both CSC and BSC over other feeder operators.
Bangladesh officials who visited Sri Lanka recently were able to prepare together with Sri Lankan officials, a draft Standard Operating System (SOP) to move ahead.
Accordingly, each line will operate one vessel initially having round voyage duration of about 14 days to maintain a weekly service frequency. Both parties share 50 percent of the cargo space/ slots on each others ship.
The CSC, however, has no vessels on its own.
The minister received Cabinet approval to call for interested parties to come forward and work within the MoU and a suitable business plan to have priority for Sri Lankan Flag registered vessels when berthing at Chittagong for a year.
The Cabinet, in addition, granted approval to exempt seafarers working onboard vessels registered under the Sri Lankan Flag Registry from PAYE taxes.

CYRIL ERNEST: a gutty sportsman in all earnestness
He was ernest in anything he signed up to do. Whether it was to attend to patients with heart aliments or caring for family and friends he was there, always. But when it came to sports the earnestness that Dr. Cyril Ernest devoted his energies and talent was legendary. No wonder then that we feature him today as our SPORTS LEGENDS'.
In any form of cricket, be it local or international it is essential that every team carry with them an all-rounder or all rounders. An all-rounder is a must because he will be of great importance to the team and above all to his captain.
On Sri Lanka cricket and at the time of writing, a close scrutiny will show that there is no all-rounder of repute win the team which is a pity.That coaches and captains dont lay emphasis on all-rounders is inexplicable.
And an all-rounder who shone in all forms of cricket in the 1960s and 1970s was CYRIL ERNEST. More on him as this copy unwinds. He was a hard hitting opening batsman crafty off spinner and a brilliant close in catcher who would pocket blinding catches so to say.
Highly prestigious Test arena
Before the country entered the highly prestigious TEST arena, the country had first class all-rounders such as Gamini Goonasena, Ivers Gunesekera, Stanley Jayasinge, Abu Fuard and Neil Chanmugam. They were a team and a captains dream.
During our time taking to the game in the under-12, to name our coaches Bro. Stanislaus, Bro Condrad and Herman Candappa at St. Benedicts College, Kotahena would at practice give every player trying for a place in the squad to bat, bowl and also watch in what position we would be best in the field.
These coaches would instill in us that that one must endeavor to be an all-rounder. While being a brilliant batsman or a classy fielder or a promising bowler would be appreciated, they would talk to us on the importance of being an all-rounder and explain to us what it would be to a team.
One of the best all rounders
Now to CYRIL ERNEST and he was an all-rounder who could have held his own against the best not only in local cricket but international as well. He was a hard hitting right hand opening batsman in the mould of Gordon Greenidge of the West Indies, a right arm off spinner of the likes of Englands Jim Laker and Windies Lance Gibbs, a close in fielder like Australias Bobby Simpson.
ERNEST began his career at St.Marys College, Negombo where he shone like a beacon and then stroked his way to St.Benedicts College, Kotahena where he debuted under the captaincy of Lionel Fernando in 1959 and the next year under the writer in 1960.
ERNEST showcased his talents when as a 15-year old he played for Negombo United in a Daily News trophy game and missed a century by just 10 runs against NCC which had the famous G.M. Spittle in the NCC team. Spittle watching the young man in action predicted a bright future for him and he lived up to that.
St. Marys first side
And then making it to the St. Marys first side he made 85 against St.Thomas, Kotte and registered three scores of over 50 against St.Anthonys Wattala, St.Marys,Chilaw and Carey College with his best bowling effort being 5 for 33 against St.Anthonys College, Wattala.
Then he played for the Combined Negombo Schools against the Indian schools and was top scorer with 28 and capturing 3 for 14.
ERNEST did not want to blow his own trumpet but my urging him made him reveal that he was selected for the Rest team in the schools quadrangular and scored a dashing 66 against a star studded Colombo North Schools team led by Anandian Yatagama Amaradasa.
The CNS team had the cream of schoolboys cricketers of that era and to name them were  Neville Casiechetty and Cecil Waidyaratne (SBC), Priya Perera, Raja de Silva and Tissa de Zoysa (SJC), Nihal Amaradasa (Nalanda), Upali Samaratne and L.R. Gunetilleke (Wesley).
Gladly welcomed to SBC
The next year he was gladly welcomed to St.Benedicts College and opening the batting his best scores were 64 vs STCML, 57 vs SACK, 71 vs SJC and 70 against St. Annes Kurunegala and 50 vs Combined Schools and his best figures were 5 for 31 against Royal.
After a successful school season, where he also shone in studies he entered University/Medical School. He captained the Sara Trophy side in 1966/67. He also led the University team on a tour of India for the inter-university cricket tourney.
His batting highlights in the Uni team were 82 vs. Moratuwa, 55 and 52 against them again, 53 vs SSC, 60 vs Tamil Union, 45 vs SSC which knock helped them win the Sara trophy and in bowling he remembers taking 5 wickets against SSC.
Captain doctors
During his stay at the university doctors who captained the team were Carlyle Perera, Buddy Reid, Lareef Idroos and Mohanlal Fernando and ERNEST too captained the team and he led the team to India for the inter-university tourney in Bangalore in 1966.
After winning the Sara trophy the Uni rewarded them with a trip to Singapore and Malaysia and against the Negrisembilan state team he made 56 and 49 against Combined Malaysian Armed Forces. He was successful with the ball and had figures of 8 for 99 vs. Malaysia and 6 for 33 against Penang.
After graduating from medical school he joined up with the Nondescripts and played for two years with best bowling figures of 8 for 7 against Moors, 6 for 15 against University 6 for 99 against Nomads.
Joining the Air Force
Later he quit NCC and threw in his lot with the Air Force where he was a formidable opponent playing for Adastrians captaining the team in 1970 with 139 not out vs Saracens, and again 84 vs Saracens and several other scores of over 30. 5 for 82 and 7 for 38 against Army being his best figures.
His most memorable experience was playing for the country under Michael Tissera against Colin Cowdreys MCC team in 1969 and capturing the wickets of Colin Cowdrey and Basil dOliveira in a game won by Sri Lanka.
In a Gopalan trophy game against Madras he scored 45 not out in the second innings to help Sri Lank win that game. He played against Pakistan which team included Imtiaz Ahmed, Javed Burki, Asif Iqbal and Intikhab Alam. He was also selected to play against Pakistan in 1971 but unfortunately the tour was cancelled because of the India - Pakistan war over the formation of Bangladesh.
Migrated to USA
When he migrated to USA it was their gain and big loss to Sri Lanka as a sportsman and doctor. While playing cricket, hockey, being an athlete how he found time for studies that finally ended up in him being a cardiologist much in demand in the US is amazing.
In the USA he played for the national team in the Associate Members World Cup in Birmingham, England in 1982. He was manager of the USA team in 1995/96 and was Chairman of the Selection Committee 1995/96. He has the rare distinction of playing for two countries Sri Lanka and America.
Dr Ernest was a keen long distance runner, running in four marathons Honolulu twice in 1985 and 86, Los Angeles 1987 and Bejing 1995 and numerous 5 and 10 kilometre races. In addition he is also a formidable black belter in Taekwondo /Karate.
Medical Administrator
Dr Ernest achieved all this while being a top Consultant Physician and Cardiologist and a Medical Administrator. He specialized in Internal Medicine and Cardiovascular diseases. He is a Fellow American College of Cardiology in 1985, Fellow American College of Chest Physicians 1985 and
Fellow American College of physicians 1990. He held the position of President Los Angeles County Medical Association in 1984 and served in the Los Angeles County Medical Association Board of Governors.
One mishap that is vivid in his mind was when playing for the Rest X1 against Nationalized Services in the Robert Senanayake trophy tournament in 1967 at the Colombo Oval when a Sylvester Dias bouncer when he failed to connect with a pull and had his nose shattered.
He was taken to the emergency room in a taxi with blood streaming and had the famous Orthopaedic Surgeonur Dr. Reinzie Pieris another Old Ben who reset his displaced nasal bone fracture. But his courage made him to come back and continue batting making 48. ERNEST also presented a Bowling Machine to St. Benedict's college cricketers.
Recalling old memories
Dr. Ernest was here recently for the BenedictIne Prize Giving as chief guest with his wife Dr. Indrani and daughters Cheryl and Melanie and it raised goose flesh meeting him with cheer leader of that era Kenneth Daberera and team mates Ranjit Fernando and Anton Abeysekera going down
memory lane and recalling anecdotes of old.

DFCC Bank engages youth, makes impact  on World Environment Day
DFCC Bank recently commemorated World Environment Day by conducting a tree planting campaign at Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya in Ranala.
While DFCCs Sustainability Unit planted 50 fruit trees with the students of the school, the banks Community Projects team organized the donation of agricultural and gardening equipment, to enable the students to continue nurturing the newly planted trees.
The event, which was attended by Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalayas entire staff, all 300 students, as well as most of the students parents, kicked off with a brief address by the Vice Principal of the school, where he highlighted the significance of World Environment Day and the importance of planting trees. He also thanked DFCC Bank for involving Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya in an initiative of this nature, which will contribute towards enhancing the schools natural surroundings, whilst giving the students an opportunity to engage in agricultural and eco-friendly activities. The agricultural equipment and tools were then handed over to the school by Senaka Jayasinghe and Ruvini Hettiarachchi, members of DFCC Banks Sustainability Unit. This was followed by the planting of trees around the school playground, by students, teachers, parents as well as DFCC Bank officials and representatives. After all of the trees had been planted, each class in the school was given the responsibility of looking after five trees, so as to ensure a high survival rate for the plants, which in turn would help make the initiative a success. The event concluded with the DFCC team handing out snacks and beverages to all the students and participants that were present at the school grounds.
Commenting on DFCC Banks World Environment Day celebrations, Lakshman Silva, CEO of DFCC Bank said, This World Environment Day, we are very pleased to have had the chance to give back to the planet and do our part as responsible corporate citizens, by hosting a tree planting campaign at Dedigamuwa Kanishta Vidyalaya. We recognize the value of teaching our youth, the importance of conserving our environment and natural resources, and we hope that this initiative will inspire and encourage the students of the school to become more involved in environmentally friendly practices and activities. Another highlight of this years World Environment Day was our visit to Korathota Somananda Vidyalaya in Athurugiriya, where we planted 100 seedlings on World Environment Day 2017 as well. It was an absolute delight to see that nearly all the young seedlings we had planted a year ago had flourished into healthy trees. We look forward to working on similar tree planting initiatives in the future, and engaging with youth across the island.
DFCC Bank remains committed to protecting and preserving the environment and care for society and the environment is one of the Banks core values. The Bank continually encourages its clients, employees and service providers to adopt environmentally responsible practices. Furthermore, employees are encouraged to volunteer and engage with the community in order to address social and environmental efforts and the Bank takes proactive measures to educate them on concepts related to sustainability and environment protection.

Dignity to the Dear Departed
Disaster strikes us oftentimes, uninvited. Once arrived, it leaves rubble with quite much to attend to. Buildings collapse, and they can be rebuilt. Trees fall down, and they can be replanted. Materials smash up, and they can be repurchased. Can the same be said about the humans
The humans matter above everything else. It wreaks havoc when a post-disaster death toll swells in cancerous proportions. Disasters come with the inevitable consequences of death. One remedy is available for disaster-led deaths: dignified management of dead bodies. This field of study requires an exclusive attention of the regional emergency response services. A number of organisations, both at government and non-government levels, enter the ground to work on the most important task at hand, managing the dead bodies.
The dead cannot speak. They are lifeless remains of a life. Yet, they deserve dignity. Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry Secretary Dr. Anil Jasinghe, who was instrumental in establishing the Trauma Secretariat, maintains that Sri Lankas foremost lesson of the dignified management surfaced with the Tsunami which struck the country in 2004.
I remember about 35,000 bodies were piled up. The disposal was a tough job. The even tougher issue was on how to dispose of the human remains with dignity. The government in its own right contributed to an honourable burial. The Health and other related ministries were called upon to assist the dignified disposal of the dead bodies.
Dr. Jasinghe reminisced this at the third Asia Conference on Regional Cooperation and Policy Development on the Management of the Dead in Emergencies organised by the International Committee of Red Cross Sri Lanka Branch to explore the contemporary options of the dignified management. The conference provided the institutions responsible for the management of the dead in disasters with the information and tools necessary to identify criteria and the set of actions needed for the development of policies and formulation of strategies. At the same time, the meeting offered a platform to follow up on discussions held in the first two editions of the Conference and to promote greater regional cooperation. The event also coincided with the introduction of Management of Dead Bodies after Disasters: a Manual for First Responders, a joint publication by WHO, Pan American Health Organization (PAHO), the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies (IFRC). The first edition of the manual, published in 2006, was developed after the tsunami. It has since been used widely around the world and is the most downloaded document from the World Health Organization website whenever a natural disaster occurs.
Policies
The development of policies for the proper management of the dead ensures that the bodies are handled with dignity, managed properly to restore their identities and returned to their relatives and their societies in cases of disasters. The Conference was graced by the representatives from forensic institutions and institutions dedicated to disaster relief, as well as other relevant institutions. Representatives from Afghanistan, Bangladesh, Bhutan, India, Indonesia, Maldives, Nepal, Pakistan and Philippines were in attendance.
Sri Lanka has evolved quite much in the post-disaster dignified management of dead bodies. Yet, the country has more room to improve in Dr. Jasinghes opinion. The common mans attitude, for that matter, needs to change which is mostly centred around myths.
Most people believe that cadavers spread epidemics. This is a myth caused by the intricacies of cadaver management. The cadaver management is a basic requirement of the dignified management. For that, we need to eliminate the common myths. Even if the person had died of an epidemic, the cadaver does not spread the disease, Dr. Jasinghe emphasized.
The management of dead bodies, because it needs to be executed in a dignified manner, requires the intervention of several international organisational bodies. According to ICRC Regional Forensic Manager Jacqueline Rodriguez, the ICRC provides financial as well as technical support to establish a connection between the family members separated from their loved ones. The most essential ingredient in establishing the connection is the proper and dignified management of the dead in disasters.
Natural disasters can have catastrophic consequences, causing large numbers of deaths, observed Ravindra Fernando, who is Emeritus Professor of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology at the University of Colombo. Local organisations and communities are usually the first to respond to a disaster, which includes rescuing and caring for survivors and managing the dead, Professor Fernando added.
The first responsibility of the dignified management rests with the first responders. Wherever the disaster takes place, the first responders are required to follow simple, practical and easy guidelines in order to complete the initial stages of dignified management of the human remains. They take the foremost steps which assist the forensic experts who will be in the scene, though not anytime sooner, to establish the connections of the missing people. The task of the first responders, so to say, is absolutely a necessity in the dignified management of dead bodies.
Who is likely to be the first responders The residents, most likely. And then the volunteers from various organisations followed by the local authorities and communities. The forensic experts might probably be the last to arrive in the scene given the gravity of the disaster. Which is exactly why the first responders should get into the job straight away.
Lack of training
Most first responders are not trained to handle dead bodies, but there is a lot that they can do to give the best possible chance to investigators to identify the remains of those killed.
Dignified management of the dead is a key component of disaster response. Lack of awareness of the persons who handle the dead bodies is a major problem. These first responders need simple, practical and easy-to-follow guidelines, ensuring that they can carry out this task in a proper and dignified way. This includes taking the necessary steps to aid future work by forensic specialists and investigators in identifying human remains and clarifying the fate of the missing, Professor Fernando explained.
Unique code to each body
The first responders first task is allocating a unique code to each body. Second, they must take photographs and record data about each and every body at the earliest possibility. The third requirement is to place each dead body in a body bag. Fourthly, the bodies should be stored in an orderly manner.
These four steps, though seemingly simple, are the initiative of the long and arduous task of dignified management of dead bodies. This enables the identification of any missing person. But the process is not over yet. On a parallel track, a list of the missing must be formulated while gathering information on the persons mentioned therein.
This is homework that makes the forensic experts job easier. This homework needs done soonest possible, as dead bodies are subject to decomposition. When the forensic experts get into the scene, the completion of the preliminary stages helps the facilitation of the identification. According to the field manual, the first responders need not be the forensic experts themselves. But if they follow the basic steps to the letter, that will improve the forensic identification of the dead and hence enable them a dignified management.
The first responders are key, emphasizes Stephen Cordner, Professor of Forensic Pathology, who is also the lead author of the manual. These people are first on the scene when a disaster strikes. They can follow the simple steps in this manual to make the work of the experts more effective later.
The field manual employs drawings and photos that coach the first responders on handling dead bodies with dignity. Descriptions are succinct on allocating a unique code to each body, taking photographs, collecting and recording data about the body, placing it in a body bag and storing bodies temporarily. The first responders are also enlightened on the safe handling of bodies of people who died from an infectious disease.
The manual has been made use of in many settings. It has offered guidance to many teams working on recovering the bodies of hundreds of migrants who died in a boat that sank near the island of Lampedusa in 2013.
Yet, in Sri Lanka Professor Ravindra Fernando observes a few hiccups in the dignified management process.
The major problem in tidewaters is to search and collect the dead bodies, proper identification, performing quick but thorough autopsies and release the bodies to the relatives. Lack of trained staff and resources are the challenges we face, he explained.
Despite a few hiccups, the country is faring much better than it did a few years ago.
Since the Tsunami tragedy in 2004, we are better prepared and equipped to deal with such catastrophes. Sri Lankans are now trained to face such disasters, Professor Fernando added.
Post conflict, the Red Cross registered more than 34,000 tracing requests from families whose relatives had gone missing. They currently have a caseload of over 16,000 tracing requests people island-wide, back to 1990.
Between 2014 and 2015, the Red Cross carried out an island-wide family Needs Assessment with 395 families of missing people to identify their needs. This resulted in a detailed finding from the assessment and recommendations on how to address these needs. According to the majority of families interviewed, their most pressing need is to know the fate and whereabouts of their missing relatives followed by the need for emotional support. Families also need help to restart their livelihoods and to deal with administrative and legal difficulties. The Red Cross has initiated that project of addressing these needs with a support programme implemented through local organisations.
The families of missing people experience a loss known as an ambiguous loss, which is defined by the state of uncertainty they live in. The Red Cross conducts lectures in universities on the concept of ambiguous loss to raise awareness of it with the aim of having it added to psychology and counselling curricula. The understanding of ambiguous loss is essential to provide families with emotional support to cope while they wait for answers.
The ICRC has also worked with the authorities to introduce the Certificate of Absence as an alternative to the death certificate in Sri Lanka for missing persons whose fate is yet to be ascertained. They also provide legal guidance on missing people in addition to the scientific process of identifying human remains.
Their worldwide role encompasses ensuring that the remains of people who died during the armed conflict, disasters or migration are handled with dignity and professionally managed. In the Sri Lankan context, the organisation trains the judicial medical community on the application of forensic archaeology and anthropology in the recovery, analysis and identification of human remains.
They also sponsor and conduct workshops to address challenges in the management of the dead in disasters. As part of a quality-assurance pilot project they are developing with the Institute of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology, the Red Cross is providing technical expertise to improve existing facilities, build capacity, and to collect, centralize and manage forensic-related data.

Ex-Pakistan PM Nawaz Sharif sentenced to 10 years over corruption

A Pakistani anti-corruption court has found former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif guilty of corruption and sentenced him to 10 years in prison and a $10.5m fine, a move that could be a blow to his PML-N partys chances in an upcoming general election.
Judge Muhammad Bashir read the verdict before a packed courtroom in the capital Islamabad on Friday.
The case relates to the ownership of four apartments in the upmarket Park Lane neighborhood of London, the capital of the United Kingdom.
Sharif wasdismissed as Prime Minister last July over corruption allegations, with the Supreme Court ordering the anti-corruption watchdog to launch proceedings against him and his family.
In 2016, an International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ) leak of 11.5 million legal documents  dubbed the'Panama Papers' showed the Sharif family had secured a $13.8m loan in 2007, using the apartments as collateral.
"Today, the anti-corruption courts verdict [] has made it clear that these assets, the Avenfield apartments, were acquired through corrupt means," prosecutor Sardar Muzaffar Abbasi told reporters outside the courtroom.
Sharifs daughter Maryam, also a political leader who has taken an increasingly frontline role in the party, was found to be involved in the ownership of a series of offshore companies, in whose name the properties were held.
The court also ordered that the apartments owned by Sharifs be seized and handed over to the Pakistani government.
Nawaz's brother, Shehbaz Sharif, the president of the PML-N, said the party rejected the verdict, and will use all legal and constitutional means to challenge the verdict.
"I believe that the timing of this verdict is an attempt to influence the outcome of the election," Shehbaz, a former Chief Minister of northern Punjab state, said at a press conference in the eastern city of Lahore.
Nawaz Sharifs political future
On Friday, Maryam was also found guilty, and sentenced to seven years imprisonment and a $2.6m fine.
With this verdict, Maryam Nawaz now stands disqualified from standing in Pakistan's July general election as a candidate.
Her husband Muhammad Safdar was also sentenced to one year in prison, and will stand disqualified from running the upcoming polls.
In April, the Supreme Court effectively ended Nawaz Sharifs political career in Parliament bybanninghim from running for public office for life.
Both father and daughter had earlier asked for a delay in the verdict, so that they may have attended the hearing in person, as they did regularly throughout proceedings.
In atweetafter the verdict, Maryam Nawaz said people stood by her father."Well done Nawaz Sharif! You weren't afraid, and you didn't bow down. You gave priority to Pakistan over your own personal interests. The people stand by with you. You will be victorious."
Both are currently in London, where they are tending to Kulsoom Nawaz, Nawazs wife, who is critically ill and is being treated at a hospital there.
"I am not a dictator who will run away from the courts," Nawaz told a press conference on Wednesday, saying he would face whatever punishment the court handed down.
Verdicts in two further cases against the Sharif family are still pending.
"I am absolutely ready [to go to jail]," Maryam told reporters earlier this week. "This is not something to be afraid of."
Separately, top Nawaz aide Fawad Hassan Fawad was arrested during an interrogation by the anti-corruption watchdog in the eastern city of Lahore on Thursday.
Nawaz and his partys leaders have termed the corruption cases a witch-hunt, alleging the countrys powerful military wanted him out of power as he had challenged its control over aspects of security and foreign policy.
Pakistans military denies any involvement in politics, but has ruled Pakistan for roughly half of its 70 years since independence.
The Sharif family is expected to appeal Fridays verdict at the Supreme Court.

FDIs - Global  Tendencies  and Issues
In 2017, global flows of Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) dropped by 23%, in spite of the growth recorded on macro economic aspects and trade. On an overall basis, there is substantial drop of return on FDIs over the last five years. There is a decrease in mergers and acquisitions, and the said down turn was more experienced by developed and transition economies.
United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) is paying great attention in promoting investment and enterprise for sustainable and inclusive development in the globe. In view of the above, UNCTAD does research and policy analysis and providing technical assistance to over 160 countries. The global economic governance has different pillars such as multilateral monitory institutions such as IMF, multilateral trading institutions such as WTO (World Trade Organization), but there is no such institution for investments and UNCTAD is bridging this gap through various policy related research studies and World Investment Forum conducted annually. This year the World Investment Forum is taking a diversified approach by including discussion topics such as sustainability, human rights, employment, health, woman empowerment and urban planning. International development agencies such as WTO, World Bank, FAO (Food and Agriculture Organization) and ILO (International Labor Origination) have significantly contributed to these diversified discussions.
In addition to the above World Bank has taken steps to initiate Global Investment Report which is more focused on Foreign Direct Investment behaviors in developing countries, both as a source and a beneficiary. It is vital to understand that policy design and implementation is one of the key factors. Creating a business friendly environment can make investors reach their markets effectively, and expand in to local and global economies. Additionally, investors are more cautious about political stability, security, and favorable macro-economic conditions and a promising legal and regulatory atmosphere.
It is a known fact that in developing economies, FDIs are the largest form of external finance that is reaching an economy even going beyond the official development assistance they receive. Over 40 percent of global investments amounting to USD 1.75 trillions reached (year 2016) the developing economies provided much needed private capital. Further it brings in technical know-how, managerial skills and access to external markets, providing better job opportunities and enhanced productivity. Foreign Investors could make a positive impact on economic growth by way of setting up global industry standards and better working conditions and address climate change and other Sustainable Development Goals.
investment decisions
The investment policies, local market size, favorable and steady exchange rate and policy, skilled labor force, physical infrastructure, macro economic conditions and political stability are considered key decision making factors for FDIs. Political stability reflects through following aspects; Lack of transparency and predictability in dealing with public agencies, sudden change in the laws and regulations with a negative impact, delays in obtaining necessary government permits, approvals to start or operate a business, restrictions in the ability to transfer and convert currency, breach of contract by the government and Expropriation or taking of property and assets by the government.
The policy makers and authorities can make environment low risks conducive, in order to attract investments. It is more challenging for government to be competitive with other countries by providing such enabling environment. Every economy is offering lower tax, tax holidays and other investment incentives for preferred business sectors in order to attract prospective investors. Not only by those factors, investor decisions may vary, based on other factors such as; access to domestic markets, access to regional markets through Preferential Trade Agreements & Bilateral Investment Treaties and access to natural resources, access to land, availability of domestic financing sources, availability of local suppliers, high predictability in law and regulations. On overall basis, ease of doing business has become a key decision making criteria. Globally, there is high competition to attract IT / electronic related productions, biomedical, machinery, automotive and pharmaceutical investments, and developing countries are doing their level best in achieving their targets.
There are four types of investors who would be reacting differently for investment policies and administration aspects of a country. Natural resourceseeking FDIs , Strategic assetseeking FDIs who would be bringing in technology, brands and competitive edge, Market Seeking FDIs who are interested in local or regional market access and Efficiency seeking FDIs who are more interested in cost saving, getting connected with International production networks and or targeting export of production.
Behavior of multi national corporations
Most of the Multinational Corporations through their efficiency seeking FDIs are expecting to bring in expatriate staff and interested in work permits, owning all equity, Capacity and skills of local suppliers, upgrading potential suppliers, and being export oriented, incentives to invest in supplier upgrading, importing production inputs etc. It is a proven fact that more than one third of investors, invest their profits back in the entity where authorities should encourage them expand the existing investments. Global Investment Research revealed that multinational corporates have taken decisions to wind up operations in developing countries due to reasons such as change of their own business strategies, unstable macroeconomic conditions and unfavorable exchange rate conditions, policy and regulation uncertainty, arbitrary conduct of the government, sudden restrictions on profit transfers,
Developing economies
Many developing countries, are having ineffective administrations, unclear regulations, complex procedures and high transaction costs making them un productive and very low in competitiveness. As defined ease of doing business criteria; starting a business, dealing with construction permits, getting electricity, registering property, getting credit, protecting investors, paying taxes, trading across borders, enforcing contracts, resolving insolvency and employing workers are the key deciding factors in recognizing efficiency of an economy. Most of the developing countries are holding a considerably lower position in above mentioned aspects Levels of bribery and corruption which is not measured by doing business index is also seriously affecting the business environment. It is obvious that investors expect Investment Promotions Agencies to be of assistance to handle issues and problems, and resolve grievances with the government, Information and assistance in setting up the operation, efforts to improve the business environment in the country, also meetings with agency officers to discuss investment opportunities, exhibitions about the country at trade shows and other events and advertising investment opportunities.
Developing country tax incentives
Tax incentives offered in developing countries can be recognized as a standard corporate income tax rate, duration of tax holidays, sector specific investment recognition and special low tax rates given for such sectors, investment tax allowances which allow investors to recover investment expenses will make a country competitive among similar investment destinations. It is a must to publish the list of incentives in a proper manner under relevant responsible agencies. Information such as incentives offered, eligibility criteria, legal basis , administration process would definitely increase not only through transparency but also assure a level playing opportunity. Such information is not expansively, not availed in developing countries.
Jordan, Pakistan, Costa Rica
As per the Investment Competitiveness Report, Jordan has made available above mentioned information through their Investment Commission website where information is regularly updated by a dedicated team. It is noteworthy that Pakistan is also taking a great effort in publishing their relevant information through Federal Board of Investment. Costa Rica, through the free trade zone law has very clearly identified the incentives offered for Investments.
OFDIs  China
Outward Foreign Direct Investments (OFDI) of China is at a very high level and it had doubled every year starting from year 2000 until 2016, and it is second only to US OFDI. Chinese investment policy has encouraged this situation and balance of payment, GDP growth, willingness to move ahead in acquiring technology, innovation backing policy makers are pushing local firms to think positive in this line. Initially Chinese investments were natural resource seeking and later became market seeking, efficiency seeking and strategic asset seeking respectively. State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) and Privately Owned Enterprises (POEs) were responsible for the said progress. SOEs of China is keen investing in politically risky host economies acquiring nationally important assets and POEs are more focused on profits and avoiding risky economic environments.
The report is clearly outlining the possibilities of developing economies to promote OFDIs with the intension of acquiring technology and markets. A Turkey based company Arcelik case is positively described as a good example and a pharmaceutical firm in Jordan is also expanding in to other countries on the same lines of OFDIs. Some economies are taking restrictive measures in OFDIs since it could affect the balance of payment and the capital availability in the home economy.
As per the World Investment Report 2018, many countries have taken critical decisions towards Foreign Investments raising concerns over security and foreign ownership of land and natural resources. Some countries are restricting foreign takeovers in strategic assets and technology firms.
Overall prospects
By 2017, FDI flow to African region was down by 21 percent reaching USD 671 billion, where developing Asia secured USD 476 Billion and Latin America attracted USD 151 Billion marking an increase of 8 percent from 2016 to 2017, boosted by steady regional economic growth. Global Average Return on FDIs is down to 6.7 percent. The said drop is well experienced in Africa, Latin America and Caribbean where it may affect the FDI flow in the long run.
As per the World Investment Report 2018, 126 positive investment policy measures were taken by 65 countries, with the view of attracting more FDIs to the their own economies through liberalizing entry conditions, streamlining administrative procedures mainly for transport, energy and manufacturing sectors. 101 economies around the globe contributing more than 90 percent of the global GDP have introduced FDI friendly Industrial Development Policies and strategies, in the recent past. These approaches are more focused on Global Value Chain Integration, knowledge economy development and sustainable development goals etc.
FDIs reaching Africa is forecast to be increased to USD 50 billion, which will be mainly boosted by African Continental Free Trade Agreement effects. FDIs flowing in to Asia is expected no growth and would be around USD 470 billion. FDIs coming to China will continue to grow through the newly declared liberalization plan. Latin America also will not have high hopes and remain around USD140 billion, in an environment macro-economic uncertainties with spillover effects
Regional Trends in securing FDIs in 2017 could be briefly understood as ; economies in the region of Africa attracted FDIs with a down turn compared to previous year performance. Egypt received USD 7.4 billion, Nigeria USD 3.5 billion, Morocco USD 2.7 billion, Ethiopia 3.6 billion and Ghana receiving USD 3.3 billion. In Developing Asia, only China had a positive growth reaching USD 136 billion, India having USD 39 billion with 10% down turn, Hong Kong having USD 104 billion with a 11% down turn compared to year 2016. Singapore also experienced a downward trend of 19% but secured USD 62 billion where Indonesia managed to secure USD 23 billion with upward trend compared with 2016 figures.
Latin America and Caribbean had a positive trend with Mexico, Colombia, Peru, Brazil and Argentina acquiring approximately USD 125 billion. The World Investment Report 2018 further discussing the FDI values secured by Leased Developed Nations such as Myanmar securing 4.3 billion USD, Cambodia having USD 2.3 billion, Bangladesh USD 2.2 billion, Ethiopia USD 3.6 billion, Mozambique securing USD 2.6 billion in 2017.
Developed economies are more interested in attracting FDIs as priority order of ; Information and communication Professional services Pharmaceuticals Automotive Machinery. Developing and transition economies prefer to have the following priority sequence for FDIs ; Food and beverages, Agriculture Information and communication Utilities Construction Pharmaceuticals
Given the fact that half of the global FDI stock is either owned or located in US, the tax reform bill implemented by US government, in December 2017 would bring in a change to the overall FDI atmosphere. Multi National Enterprises would try to bring funds invested elsewhere back to US, due to recently introduced corporate tax regime.

CA Sri Lanka, CMA & AAT unveils Creating a Profession Par Excellencejoint initiative
Global accounting body president in high praise of Lankan accounting bodies
President of the International Federation of Accountants (IFAC), Rachel Grimes praised the countrys top three local accounting bodies; CA Sri Lanka, CMA Sri Lanka and AAT Sri Lanka for coming together to strengthen the profession by launching the Creating a Profession Par Excellence new strategic initiative.
Delivering a speech at the event, Grimes, who heads the global body of the accounting profession congratulated the three local bodies for taking this important step and uniting for the betterment of the profession.
This is a big celebration and a much warranted one, because three bodies of the 175 bodies of IFAC have united and this is a great step forward, and I congratulate everybody for pulling this off, she said.
Grimes also praised the Sri Lankan accounting professionals including CA Sri Lanka members for their fantastic contribution made while serving as members of various top IFAC committees.
The Creating a Profession Par Excellence -- a strategic initiative jointly launched by CA Sri Lanka, CMA Sri Lanka and AAT Sri Lanka, aims to further strengthen the accounting profession and also ensure Sri Lanka has a sufficient skilled workforce in the country to meet the changing demands of the economy.
Speaking at the event, President of CA Sri Lanka Jagath Perera said that this is the first time that three professional national accounting bodies in Sri Lanka are working together with a single aim. We have been conceptualizing this moment where we meet at a common platformto reflect and contemplate our common aim, goals and issues, and today with the IFAC Presidents arrival we are pleased that this initiative is beginning to take shape, he said.
Speaking at the event, President of CMA Prof. Lakshman R. Watawala said that the visit of the IFAC President to Sri Lanka alone was testament of the recognition that the three Sri Lanka accounting bodies command in the global accounting arena. Our bodies have received world recognition and we must march in that direction by making young people skilled in order so that they can work in Sri Lanka and also in other countries, he said. Prof. Watawala also said that some 50% of Sri Lankan accountants work overseas and this is because they are of good quality.
President of AAT Jazri Magdon Ismail said that AAT was the only technical body in the world to hold full membership of IFAC and also of the Confederation of Asian and Pacific Accountants (CAPA).

Further, 10 elephants had been poisoned, while four had died of natural causes. Sooriyabandara added that carelessness on the side of humans was the reason for the deaths of wild elephants.

Human-scented perfume
While most people just want a fragrance that smells good and isnt too strong for everyday use, artist and innovative scientist Ani Liu makes perfumes that smell like a specific memory or person. She once created a plant that smelled like her grandparents, which ultimately led to her the create the Human Perfume project, which takes the essence of her favorite people and turns them into a wearable fragrance that can spur fond memories.
When she explains it, the MIT Media Lab graduate makes it sound so simple. Liu told National Geographic, Part of that process is to extract the volatile molecules from garments [test subjects] have worn and fix that into a solvent. It was a lot of experimentation. I had to try a lot of different solvents, concentrations, and settings in the distillation process.
While taking molecules from someones clothes and putting them in a solvent for several weeks sounds doable for the science-minded, Liu confessed it involved a lot of trial and error. She said she tried to formulate her husbands aura, but ended up with something that he said smelled disgusting, like his brother. Harsh!
In total, Liu bottled up six people including herself, her husband, and her parents, which she was passionate about because she knows they will pass away one day and wanted to create a sort of time capsule. Its kind of uncanny to unscrew a bottle and smell a person, she says.
Liu is also hard at work creating molds of her lips, feet, nose, and belly button by using microbes for her self-portrait project, Kisses From the Future. Everything she does is to question our views of what reality is. Its important because we need a wider breadth of points of views, Liu said. Imagine how problematic it could be if the only people who investigated reality were of a specific gender or cultural background

Its beautiful life!
The 2018 edition of the Japanese Film Festival will take place at the National Film Corporation (NFC) Theatre in Colombo on July 21 and 22. The launch ceremony will be held on July 20. Entrance for all movies is free on a first-come first-served basis and the movies will start on the exact times specified. The festival is being organised by the Embassy of Japan in Sri Lanka in collaboration with the NFC, National Youth Services Council (NYSC) and the Ship for World Youth Alumni Association.
The festival will feature four recent Japanese films representing different categories that have won rave reviews at home and abroad. All four movies to be featured at the festival will be subtitled in English. The movies are:
Its Beautiful Life (2012, Drama)
Set in the small town of Kamikatsu, where 48% of the population consists of the elderly, a group of elderly women come together to sell vegetable leaves which are used by restaurants for decorative purposes. Since the tangerine industry collapsed in Kamikatsu, the town seems to have slowly withered away. Eda, who works at National Agricultural Cooperative Federation, tries to give the town a boost. Edas plan is to sell vegetable leaves from the area. Residents do not like the idea, but three women stand up for Edas proposal. Even though her husband strongly opposes her, for the first time in their relationship, she goes against her husband and accomplishes her will. Her business blooms into a Yen 260 million enterprise. This is a movie based on a true story.
The Complex (2013, Horror)
Acclaimed Japanese film-maker Hideo Nakata, perhaps best known for the hit J-horror classics Ring, Ring 2 (both Japanese and Hollywood remakes) and Dark Water, heads back into supernatural territory with his chilling new film The Complex. It might lack the high-concept conceit of Ring, but the director is a master at combing urban horror with ancient terrors and this nicely fraught and twisted tale will appeal to lovers of classic J-horror.
The film, which had its world premiere at the Rotterdam Film Festival, trades on the easy Japanese acceptance of the supernatural having a very real impact on modern life, with Hideo Nakata again making great use of grim modern buildings  with the flickering lights, dingy shapes and stained walls  as the perfect backdrop for spirits terrifying the living. The film stars Atsuko Maeda (the former lead singer of J-pop group AKB48, and who starred in 2007 Japanese horror film The Suicide Song) as nursing student Asuka, who has just moved into an apartment with her parents and younger brother in the rather dilapidated Kuroyuri Building Complex.
She is woken by a strange scratching sound coming from the apartment from next door, and by an alarm clock that goes off at 6.30 a.m. When she tells college friends where she lives there are whispers about the complex being haunted. Asuka then makes friends with a young boy in the playground at the centre of the complex who seems to have no friends.
Golden Orchestra (2016, Comedy)
Toru Hosokawas Golden Orchestra is that rare light, charming comedy that not only brings laughs, but will also resonate with audiences on a deeper, personal level. This is a testament to the dedication of the filmmaker and the entire cast, many of whom are senior citizens. Based on the 2008 novel of the same name, the story revolves around a young schoolteacher, Chizuru (Anne Watanabe, daughter of actor Ken), whose lifelong dream of playing in an orchestra is reignited after attending the Umega High School concert. Intending to sign up for that same orchestra the next day, she mistakenly joins a similarly named group consisting of elderly locals who are not exactly good musicians. When the senior conductor (Takashi Sasano) suffers a heart attack during Chizurus first session, she feels obliged to handle the baton for the foreseeable future with hilarious results.
Time of Eve (2010, Sci Fi Anime)
Sometime in future Japan, androids are involved in every aspect of peoples lives. One day, upon checking his androids behavioral log, Rikuo, a student, noticed his androids returning times have been odd recently. With his friend Masaki, they found out the place where his android, Sammy, have been visiting: a small cafe called Eve no Jikan where androids and human are not seen as different. Upon talking with the people in the cafe and discovering more of Sammys behavior, Rikuo changed his view about androids and treat them as friends rather than tools. At the same time, elsewhere in Japan, the Ethics committee is trying to impose policies to reduce the involvement and use of androids in society.

Kelani Cables introduces Kelani  Masking Painters Tapes
Kelani Cables PLC recently introduced Kelani Masking Painters Tape to the local market, a product which has been needed by painters.
There are two specialties in the product. The gum in the Kelani Masking Painters Tape prevents it from sticking to already painted surfaces and when removing the tape after a new job, it doesnt harm the surface which is newly painted. Hence the product will make the job easy for house and building painters and vehicle painters and offer a chance for them to do a better job.
Kelani Masking Painters Tapes come in two width sizes that are one inch and two inches. The length ranges from 14 meters to 40 meters. (1x14, 1x28, 2x14, 1x40)
Channa Jayasinghe, Brand Development Manager, Kelani Cables PLC said, Kelani Cables always introduces a product to the market after a thorough study of the real needs and wants of the consumers and professionals in the country.
The marketplace has many products. But the need to modify the existing products and come out with innovations is needed. The revamped products our company has introduced in recent times catered to the needs of the market and are superior ones. CFL and LED bulbs and Insulating tapes that we introduced recently are different to similar products in the marketplace and are best examples, he said.
Especially when we introduced the Insulating tape it became immensely popular among electricians because the product has many superior features. Similarly when we did a research on Masking Tapes we found the need by the market for a superior product which is hassle free for painters. Hence we designed the Kelani Masking Painters Tape to cater to the needs of painters.
This product is doesnt have any limitations that other products in the market has. Hence we recommend the Kelani Masking Painters Tape to all painters in the country and request them to experience the difference by using it in their work, he added.

Reservation lands attached to minor irrigation schemes in the Matale district had been encroached by a group of individuals, causing damages to the rural tank networks recently.
Suspects had constructed a number of illegal buildings in such lands, while other regions had been utilised for cultivation activities.
In this connection, farmer organisations said that in the current state, sediment levels in tanks and anicuts were rising, while reducing their water capacities.
The said development in turn, had disrupted the progress of irrigation activities.
The Agrarian Services Department had neglected the matter, farmer organisations in the area said, while urging the the government to take immediate action to quell the issue.

Lankas top archer cold  shouldered by association
Thisaru Disnaka who reached the qualification standard for the forthcoming 2018 Youth Olympic Games in Argentina has been reportedly neglected by the Sri Lanka Archery Association who want the athlete to participate in the trials.
Only two athletes, Thisaru Disnaka and Kavisha Dalpathado participated in the world archery championships in Argentina last year and Thisaru was selected among the best sixteen archers after his performance.
For the first time in the history of Sri Lanka archery a 15-year old boy has achieved such a milestone. He qualified and secured ninth place out of 78 archers from 48 countries.
The Ministry of Sports proudly welcomed Thisaru after his achievement but the current situation in the Sri Lanka Archery Association is that they will select participants only from the trials. An official told the Daily News said that the Sri Lanka Archery Association wants to shut out Thisaru for no apparent reason.
"Due to a personnel grudge this archer is facing an issue. We hope the Minister of Sports will take necessary action regarding this matter," he said. "We are wasting our youth resources because of sports politics and this is why Sri Lanka sport ends up in bad situations.
President of the Sri Lanka Archery Association Brigadier Rajeewa Wickramasinghe said that so far five archers had reached the selection standard including Thisaru in the local trials and the final trial will be held in August.
Due to Thisaru Disnakas best performance in the World Archery Championship Sri Lanka received the quota to participate at the Youth Olympic in Argentine this year.

Lanka in Tier 2 for efforts against human trafficking
Sri Lanka has been placed in Tier 2 in the annual Trafficking in Persons Report prepared by the United States government.
The annual Trafficking in Persons Report is prepared as per the US Trafficking Victims Protection Act (TVPA) of 2000, as amended, which has authorized the establishment of the US State Departments Office to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons and the Presidents Interagency Task Force to Monitor and Combat Trafficking in Persons to assist in the coordination of anti-trafficking efforts.
The annual report, which assesses all countries, is used by the US government to engage foreign governments in dialogues to advance anti-trafficking reforms, combat trafficking and target resources on prevention, protection and prosecution programmes. Each country is placed onto one of three tiers based on the extent of the efforts by respective governments to comply with the minimum standards for the elimination of trafficking found in Section 108 of the TVPA.
From 2013 to 2016, Sri Lanka was placed in the Tier 2 Watch List for 4 successive years and upgraded to Tier 2 in 2017 in view of the proactive measures taken by the relevant agencies of government to combat trafficking. Classification of countries in this annual report of the State Department affects US assistance for countries with governments of countries on Tier 3 being subject to certain restrictions on US assistance as well as assistance from multilateral development banks.
The TIP report 2018 states that the Government of Sri Lanka demonstrated increasing efforts compared to the previous reporting period and therefore, Sri Lanka has been retained in Tier 2.
Sri Lanka recognizes and acknowledges the magnitude of the problem of human trafficking worldwide, undermining universal values and posing a threat to national security by encouraging and enriching transnational criminal as well as terrorist networks. Sri Lanka remains committed to working with the US and other bilateral partners as well as international organizations to combat this scourge locally and internationally.

Lawsuit over SLFP Chairmanship
Two political activists including the Boralesgamuwa Urban Council Chairman have filed an appeal in the Colombo Civil Appellate High Court challenging Colombo District Courts decision to dismiss a lawsuit which sought an order to reinstate the former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP).
When the appeal came up before the Civil Appellate High Court, defendant parties including the SLFP General Secretary were directed to file their answers on July 20.
On September 29 last year, the Colombo District Court upheld the preliminary objections raised by defendants including the SLFP General Secretary and decided to dismiss this lawsuit in limine.
The original lawsuit had been filed by two Plaintiffs, Boralesgamuwa Urban Council Chairman K.D. Aruna Priyasantha and Asanka Nandana Srinath, citing the SLFP General Secretary and the Election Commission Chairman as defendants.
In his preliminary objections during District Courts hearing, the SLFP General Secretary stated that plaintiffs are indirectly challenging the acts of the President of the Republic done in his capacity as the SLFP Chairman It is common ground that the SLFP Chairman is the President of the Republic. In terms of Article 35(1) of the Constitution, the President of the Republic has immunity from suit except in an action filed in terms of Article 126 of the Constitution, the SLFP General Secretary said.
The defendants had further submitted that the District Court has no jurisdiction to file action against the Election Commissioner.

Living in the Line
Juliet Coombe enjoys a traditional home stay and village cooking class in the tea country and learns why nothing beats a plot to plate cooking experience.
The Line tea experience is not easy as it is as off the grid as you can get in a place that has no internet, iPads or any other modern distractions. I quickly discover, walking from one hand cut path to another requires skill and observation, the charms of line village living, in a hidden valley of vibrant green tea slopes and the occasional coffee patch is a rustic experience that calms the mind and clears the soul.
Here is a land of a million smiles and passionate tea pickers, smiling as I pass by with their golden teeth glinting in the sunlight life is simple and rich in old fashioned traditions. Meena Amma will meet you, with a bindi spot painted on your forehead, and welcome drink in her open air mud kitchen. Her laugh is infectious, as is her sizzling traditional cooking class that I decide to join in her lovely Line home. We are welcomed in with Ayubowan, may you be blessed with a long life, and then roll up my sleeves and wash my hands. I learn step by step how to make pol sambal, chicken curry and then join the village kids on the escarpment to catch the new born baby chicks and take them up the hill to where their mother hen is happily pecking away, and probably secretly glad to get away from her naughty six fluff ball baby chicks and the naughty village kids who want to play with them.
Back in the kitchen we build a wood fire to cook on, and I help cut up vegetables, this time side ways to maximise the amount of spice that will be absorbed, and also get to blow through a blowpipe to fan the log fire cooking my first dish village style rich in gravy chicken curry and then needle the dough over and over again to get plenty of air into it so it will rise. I am told by Meena, who sprinkles coconut oil onto the dough to soften it for cooking, that this has been done the same way for hundreds of years and always, until more recently, made inside one of Sri Lankas iconic clay pots. All this is watched through a simple wooden line house open window in a hidden mountain valley, where community remains king and perhaps, I ponder as I make my first flat bread roti this is the reason for the happiness I feel everywhere I walk.
I learn a great deal about village life from the grandparents who stay at home to look after the kids, while their parents work on the escarpment. We share, tea, stories and cut up a cake to share with the rest of the village. Taking plates piled high with chocolate cakes along the line of houses gives me the perfect excuse to introduce myself to the other families who tell me stories about witchcraft and how to make games out of rope pulling and who can break the water pot with a stick, first. Returning to my home stay I watch the neighbours splattering their kids with herbal oil as a healthy hair treatment and find the older members of the community are taking them to the Tamil shrine to make an offering afterwards. The air is filled with incense as they light joss sticks and they return to eat some of the lovely food Meena and I have prepared for them in their absence. She is delighted to tell me stories about her life as a tea picker and placing rice and curry, a village meal out on a cut out banana leaf, she tells me it is because it contains enzymes that are good for our digestive systems. For me she has made a special recipe of rosemary tea boiled for three minutes. They say a cup of rosemary when you meet a new friend will cement the friendship for a lifetime, as it is great for your long-term memory. I learn it is how you knew a witch in medieval times and I make jokes by waving curry leaves over Meenas head.
As the weather turns from sunny to thundery grey it is time to finish the delicious meal and go to bed in the lovely two rooms at the back of Meens line house. Here one can hear the orchestra of insects and passing birds as one settles into a deep sleep. Somehow the pure mountain air clears the head and makes one feel like sleeping forever. However the village cockerel has other ideas and at crack of dawn I am up with the rest of the village pulling my weight in the home garden, laughing and playing with the kids and exchanging stories about the good old days. Luckily here slow cooking remains king and community is what matters.
For those who like living in unique community spaces, Meena Line experience home stay in her two lovely rooms can be booked on booking.com

Former captain Angelo Mathews was named to lead the Sri Lanka Board XI alongside other Test batsmen Dhananjaya de Silva and Roshen Silva for the two-day warm-up match against the touring South African team commencing at P Sara Oval tomorrow.
Also named was discarded Test opener Kaushal Silva and Danushka Gunathilaka who has yet to secure a permanent place in the Test team.
Gunathilaka in fact has been named in the 16-member Test squad for the two-Test series and a good innings here would get him the nod to partner Dimuth Karunaratne in the openers slot. Gunathilaka who has appeared in three Tests for his country so far has failed to clinch a permanent batting spot in the side. In his last Test against West Indies at Bridgetown which Sri Lanka won by four wickets he made 29 and 21 in a low scoring night game.
Dhananjaya and Roshen have been included in an attempt to get them into form following a poor run in the Caribbean series.
Roshen averaged 14.16 with a top score of 48 while Dhananjaya who missed the first Test due to his fathers untimely death averaged 10 with a highest score of 17. Both of them are very much short of runs ahead of the South African Test series.
Mathews left the West Indies tour after playing just one Test to attend to the birth of his second child. He too is short of match practice having come out of injury for the Caribbean series only to return home early.
In the absence of Dimuth Karunaratne due to a finger injury Sri Lanka struggled to get a proper opening combination going in the West Indies series trying out as many as four batsmen to fit into the slot - Kusal Mendis, Kusal Perera, Mahela Udawatte and Danushka Gunathilaka.
Kaushal Silva who was one time partner to Karunaratne but overlooked since October 2017 gets another opportunity to regain his place in the side following an impressive run in the domestic season.
Although the batting looks pretty strong the same cannot be said of the bowling line up which does not carry the same experience with Avishka Fernando and Asitha Fernando as the only bowlers to break into international cricket each having played in a solitary ODI.
SRI LANKA BOARD XI: Angelo Mathews (captain), Dhananjaya de Silva, Kaushal Silva, Danushka Gunathilaka, Roshen Silva, Minod Bhanuka (wk), Avishka Fernando, Kasun Madushanka, Lasith Ambuldeniya, Vimukthi Perera, Asitha Fernando, Reserves: Ashen Bandara, Vikum Sanjaya, Wanindu Hasaranga.

MR must make statement on US$ 7.6 mn funding - Marikkar
Colombo district UNP MP S.M. Marikkar said yesterday that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should make a statement in Parliament on whether he received US$7.6 million from China Harbour Company for his election campaign in 2015.
Addressing a media briefing held in UNP Headquarters 'Sirikotha' yesterday, he said that Rajapaksas henchmen like Wimal Weerawansa should also say whether the former President received this money from China Harbour company or not.
Several associates of former President had issued death threats to two local media personnel for giving information to the New York Times.But, why former President would not sue the New York Times without threatening the media personnel.
"We also urge the journalists to report the truth in this regard without being scared of anyone. There are no restrictions on media freedom today while no journalists were killed, assaulted and made to disappear during the Yahapalanaya government.We will not allow this matter to be swept under the carpet due to the Vijayakala Maheswaran issue.
"We urge the President to appoint a Presidential Commission of Inquiry to probe this matter similar to the several Presidential Commissions he appointed to investigate bond scam and corruption in SriLankan Airlines.Apparently, the China harbour company has considered this bribe as an investment. They have added an interest too for this money.Unfortunately, it is the people of this country who have to bear this burden through taxes, he added.

MR supplying fun
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, now caught up in a major scandal, where, it is alleged, he received US$ 7.6 million as election campaign funds from a Chinese company, as exposed by the New York Times, is busy these days trying to deflect the matter from public attention and in the process is providing light relief to the people.
At a function at his Nelum Mawatha residence, which also saw an induction of sorts of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa into the Presidential race, the former President declared that no other government has interfered with the Attorney Generals Department as the present regime. He also took up cudgels with the state media for highlighting the New York Times expose and found fault with certain state media personnel for supplying information to foreign publications. The state media has no right to act in this manner while being maintained by the money of the tax payers of this country, was Rajapaksas contention.
True, Sri Lankans are known to have short memories and this was driven home during the war years, when, after a bomb explosion, and the carnage cleared, after the initial breast beating, everything was forgotten and it was back to square one, until the next bomb. But it is doubtful that the public have forgotten certain happenings during the Rajapaksa years, certainly not the intelligent segments.
One of these relates to the Attorney Generals Department. The AG, it was well known, was at the beck and call of the Rajapaksas, and was made to do as he was told. A drug baron cum rapist was taken off the hook curtsy the Attorney Generals Department, at the instance of Rajapaksa and subsequently made a Monitoring MP of the Ministry of Defence, of all things. In addition, a onetime Deputy Minister, and, Rajapaksa loyalist, had his case, for unlawful assembly and murder, mysteriously closed by the AG who was taking direct instructions from Temple Trees. For the first time in the post independence history of this country the AGs Department was brought under the Executive, and, needlessly to say, did the bidding of the Executive. The status quo was thankfully restored via the 19th Amendment, giving full freedom to the AGs department to act independently, and, free of political interference.
This was clearly demonstrated in the manner in which a powerful Government Minister in Yahapalanaya was humbled by the counsel of the AGs Department during the Presidential Commission inquiry into the bond issue. The grilling was so intense and searching that the Minister concerned cried foul and blamed the AGs Department for attempting to vilify him. This was in contrast to the free run the offenders in the government had under Rajapaksa.
The former President, who is today blaming the AGs Department of following the instructions of the government, not only made the AGs Department an appendage of the Executive, but also went to the extent of taming the Supreme Court. Rajapaksa had the first lady Chief Justice of this country impeached for ruling against his brothers attempt to use state funds outside the sanction of Parliament. Not only that, government ministers, with goons in tow, pitched camp outside the beleaguered Chief Justices official residence, hurling insults at her with the aid of loudspeakers, while Rajapaksa did not raise a finger to halt this abomination, where the countrys highest court was humiliated.
Rajapaksas statement, vis-a-vis the state media, is as skewered as his comments on the AGs Department. He raises issue that the state media, which is maintained with public funds should act independently. If only this wisdom had dawned on him before January 2015, perhaps he would still have been holding the reins of power. It was the gross abuse of the state media that had as much to do with his defeat as the other allegations.
This was most pronounced during both Presidential Election campaigns in 2010 and 2015. On election day, in 2010, state television suddenly announced while the voting was in progress, that Sarath Fonseka was ineligible to contest, since he had not registered as a voter. This, while Wimal Weerawansas name too had not been in the electoral register but allowed to contest at elections. It was left to the Election Commissioner to go on air and set matters right, over a private television channel. At the 2015 poll, too, a similar stunt was attempted when Rupavahini suddenly stopped its programmes to announce that Sajith Premadasa had crossed over to the Rajapaksa camp. It was left to the intrepid Mahinda Deshapriya to intervene and virtually threaten the state television channel to retract the obvious falsehood.
Not only that, during the entirety of the campaign, both state television channels were used to character assassinate the Common Candidate, on a very personnel level, while the latters paid for advertisements, in the state media, were withheld. On the other hand, there is a case still pending in the courts where Rajapaksa had failed to settle his campaign advertisement bills, running into millions of rupees.
So much for the sanctimonious preachings that the state media, maintained by the tax payers, should be independent.

N-E housing project to generate Rs. 14.22 billion in two years
The Resettlement, Rehabilitation, Northern Development and Hindu Religious Affairs Ministry has said the 40,000 housing project for the conflict-affected in the North and East is scheduled to begin soon.
Two factories will be set up to produce construction materials for the houses. The housing project and the two factories will bring Rs. 51.975 billion as financial benefit to the country within the projected two-year period, the Ministry said in a statement.
The construction of 40,000 houses will create 15,000 job opportunities in the North and East in two years. The company intends to pay an average of Rs. 40,000 all inclusive per month for an individual labourer. Accordingly, it will bring Rs. 13.2 billion directly to the war-affected people in the North and East as financial benefit, within the projected two-year period.
By establishing these factories, people of the North and East will get numerous permanent job opportunities as the local agent of the construction company has agreed to establish the factories as a hub of their raw material production and exporting centre for the South East Asian region. As such, these factories will strengthen the local economy by using local resources as input and exporting construction materials.
In Phase 1 of the project, 2,000 jobs will be created for skilled and unskilled labourers.

Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) members attached to the National Blood Transfusion Centre (NBTC) will launch a strike from next Monday (9), GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the strike will be launched in protest of the conduct of the Blood Bank Acting Director and not taking action by the Health Ministry Secretary to remove him from the post with immediate effect. The strike will be extended to all sections of the Blood Transfusion Service island-wide if the Health Ministry Secretary does not take action to resolve the issue. The strike will affect blood donation leading to a blood shortage. Initially, GMOA member doctors of the Blood Bank will strike and thereafter the strike will be extended to blood supply to the private hospitals and dialysis units.
Dr. Aluthge said the Acting Director is violating the Establishment Code and tarnishing the reputation of the other doctors attached to the National Blood Transfusion Service. He does his best to tarnish the confidence of the public on the Blood Bank and provide inaccurate information to the media. He does all those things using invisible power bestowed on him by the Health Minister. he said.

Hearings of the first Anti-Corruption High Court will commence at Courtroom-1 of the Colombo High Court next week, Justice Minister Thalatha Athukorale informed the House yesterday.
The commencement of the new Anti-Corruption High Court was initially due on July 4, 2018 as instructed by the Chief Justice. However, it was postponed due to a logistical problem, Minister Athukorale also said.
She explained that the Colombo Traffic Court was moved to another location in order to set up the first Anti-Corruption High Court in the vacated space.
We thought that we could use this vacated building as it is for the high court. But, the Attorney General informed us that this building needs renovation. The Sri Lankan Navy was entrusted with the renovation process. They informed us that there is an issue regarding the roof of this said building. The Navy informed us that they cannot hand over the building by July 4, without completing repairs to the roof. They will hand us over the building in two weeks,Minister Athukorale informed the House. She also said that since the High Court was initially planned to begin on July 4, the hearings of it will commence at a separate location. The location will be Courtroom 1 of the Colombo High Court, she further explained. Minister Athukorale made these observations in reply to an oral question by JVP MP Nalinda Jayatissa with regards to cases concluded by the FCID, which are to be filed by the Attorney Generals Department. Minister Athukorale said hearings of the new High Court will commence subsequent to receiving permissions for indictments pertaining to the relevant cases.

Next-generation cockroach bot
Scientists have built a robotic cockroach that can walk on land, swim on the surface of water, and explore grounds underwater for as long as necessary.
The Ambulatory Microrobot, known as HAMR, uses multifunctional foot pads that rely on surface tension when it needs to swim. However, it can also apply a voltage to break the water surface when it needs to sink.
This process is called electrowetting, which is the reduction of the contact angle between a material and the water surface under an applied voltage. This change of contact angle makes it easier for objects to break the water surface.
The research by scientists from Harvard University in the US opens up the possibility to study new environments. Moving on the surface of water allows a microrobot to evade submerged obstacles and reduces drag. Using four pairs of asymmetric flaps and custom designed swimming gaits, HAMR robo-paddles on the water surface to swim.
Exploiting the unsteady interaction between the robot's passive flaps and the surrounding water, the robot generates swimming gaits similar to that of a diving beetle. This allows the robot to effectively swim forward and turn. "This research demonstrates that microrobotics can leverage small-scale physics - in this case surface tension - to perform functions and capabilities that are challenging for larger robots," said Kevin Chen, a postdoctoral fellow at Harvard.
HAMR weighs 1.65 grammes - about as much as a large paper clip - and can carry 1.44 grammes of additional payload without sinking. Once below the surface of the water, HAMR uses the same gait to walk as it does on dry land and is just as mobile. To return to dry land HAMR faces enormous challenge from the water's hold.
A water surface tension force that is twice the robot weight pushes down on the robot, and in addition the induced torque causes a dramatic increase of friction on the robot's hind legs.
The researchers stiffened the robot's transmission and installed soft pads to the robot's front legs to increase payload capacity and redistribute friction during climbing. Finally, walking up a modest incline, the robot is able break out of the water's hold.
"This robot nicely illustrates some of the challenges and opportunities with small-scale robots," said Robert Wood, from Harvard.
"Shrinking brings opportunities for increased mobility - such as walking on the surface of water - but also challenges since the forces that we take for granted at larger scales can start to dominate at the size of an insect," Wood said.

No legs, big dreams
Modelling can be tough for the most able-bodied people. When youre a child model, it can be especially difficult if you look different. But Daisy-May Demetre, a double amputee from Birmingham, isnt letting her disability stop her from chasing her dreams.
At just 7-years-old, shes taking the child modelling world by storm and has signed up to major label Zeebedee Management, an agency for diverse models.
Daisy-May was born with a condition called fibular hemimelia, a birth defect where part or all of the fibular bone in the leg is missing. In her case, she had a tiny fibular bone in one leg and on the other side, it was completely missing.
With Daisy-Mays balance and mobility affected, her parents Alex and Claire decided the best option was for her to have below the knee amputations on both legs.
After her operation, she was fitted with prosthetic legs. She soon learned to not only walk but run, jump and do all the things kids her age do. To show all the amazing things Daisy-May is capable of, Alex set up an Instagram account.
Following all the attention she received, the family applied to Zebedee Management where she was soon accepted.
Daisy-May has since walked in LKFW- London Kids Fashion Week, a fashion extravaganza for toddlers, kids, and teens.
To be yourself in a world that is constantly trying to make you something else is the greatest achievement, her parents wrote on her Instagram page following the fashion shoot.
When shes not posing for pictures or working on smizing, Daisy-May can be found at the park climbing monkey bars, or pulling her weight at the gym. All at the tender age of seven. She puts the rest of us to shame.

THE ILLUSION OF A DEbt TRAP IS A FALSE PROPOSITION:
No strategic aims in Htota Port project
Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka Cheng Xueyuan has met President Maithripala Sirisena to clarify his countrys stance over allegations that the Hambantota Port funded and built by the Chinese government as part of the Belt and Road initiative, may be used for military and strategic purposes.
The meeting comes a day after the Sri Lankan government announced it was shifting the naval base from Galle to Hambantota to strengthen security at the harbour. An article published in the New York Times earlier this week alleged that the China Harbour Engineering Company (CHEC) had funded former President Mahinda Rajapaksas 2015 Presidential bid and that the Port was to be used by the Chinese government to further its geopolitical interest in the region.
The fake news goes against all facts and is full of prejudice, Spokesperson for the Chinese embassy Lou Chong said.
We have no intention of interfering with the domestic affairs of a sovereign country. The Hambantota Port is a commercial venture for commercial purposes.
The spokesperson cited that the article was published on the same day China released the final tranche of the investment value for the Port.
He added that the illusion of debt trap was a false proposition created by Western media to obstruct the joint development of China and developing countries. Sri Lanka was already in debt even before we came. Out of Sri Lankas total debt of USD 51.824 Billion outstanding Chinese loans account for 10.6% (USD 5.5 Billion). 61.5% of Chinese loans are concessional ones with much lower interest rates than international market.
Meanwhile, An Xin, the Joint Managing Director of the China Harbour Engineering Company said that CHEC was willing to cooperate with the Criminal Investigations Department in their investigations into the story.
The speculation by an international media that CHEC funded former Presidents 2015 Presidential Election campaign is completely inconsistent with the facts, she said.
The construction of the Hambantota Port was an important national task based on mutual agreement between the two countries and implemented under a transparent model. CHEC has never been involved in the internal affairs of Sri Lanka.
An added that CHEC was holding discussions on the possibility of pursuing legal action against The New York Times for publishing defamatory and damaging allegations. During an informal press briefing hosted by the Chinese Embassy in Colombo, An refuted claims that no feasibility studies had been conducted adding that two feasibility studies had been done, one of which was during Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghes previous tenure.
Developing a port in Hambantota given its location was to promote the economic development of Sri Lanka. This was the consensus among different Governments led by the main political parties, she said. Sri Lanka did not initially approach China to develop the Hambantota Port. It was after other countries showed lack of interest that China offered support. It is evident that China never coerced Sri Lanka to construct the Port nor did China lure Sri Lanka into any debt trap.
Tissa Wickramasinghe of the Hambantota International Port Group added the Hambantota Port achieved 1 million TUs in the first year of operation and 2 million in the second year making it record achievement. He went on to detail future prospects of job creation at the port adding that out of the 640 employees who are presently at the port only 24 of them were expatriates.
Lou Chong speaking at the media briefing added that they were pleased to see that both the Prime Minister and President were aware of the facts pertaining to the Port. The Premier at an event last week noted that Sri Lanka had informed the Chinese that Hambantota cannot be used for military purposes.
The Sri Lanka Navy is moving its Southern Command to Hambantota. There is no need to be frightened as security of the port will be under the control of Sri Lanka Navy, he said.

Parliament
Previous governments never attempted to move NAB: PM
Allegations are levelled against the Good Governance Government for delaying the National Audit Bill, but the previous governments had not even attempted to move the Bill, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
He was initiating the parliamentary debate on the National Audit Bill when it was taken up yesterday for debate after it was postponed several times.
The National Audit Bill was a key pledge of the Good Governance Government to be adopted within the first 100 days of it assuming the power.
The National Audit Commission is an independent commission mentioned in the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
When I became the Prime Minister in 2003, I tried to bring in the Bill, but was unable to. The former government had not even made an attempt to bring in the Bill, the Prime Minister said.
President Maithripala Sirisena took measures to bring in the Audit Bill. So far, no one else has done it. Everyone had the opportunity to bring in the Bill but they did not. The President also brought in the Right to Information Bill in addition to this one," he said.
The Audit Bill was presented on several occasions and the President, Prime Minister, Ministers and the judiciary have constitutional powers. We are now working under the parliamentary powers. An audit bill is an important factor of Parliament. Some countries have a controller in this regard. Independence in an audit is very vital for the transparency and productivity of the State administration, the Prime Minister said.
Mattala Airport will not be sold: Nimal Siripala
The Government will not sell the Mattala Airport to any foreign investor, Transportation and Civil Aviation Minister Nimal Siripala de Silva yesterday assured.
Minister De Silva made the observation joining the adjournment motion moved by the JO on the joint venture between India and Sri Lanka over the Mattala Airport.
The government expects to develop the Airport via a joint venture and turn it to a profit making establishment, he said.
The government will also act with utmost transparency when entering into the joint venture, Minister De Silva said.
The agreement between India and Sri Lanka over the Airport will be put to Parliament after obtaining the Cabinet approval, Minister De Silva said. "Whatever the decisions made, the agreement will go through Parliament, he said.
The agreement will not in anyway jeopardise the national security, Minister De Silva assured.
He said the agreement will most probably be fixed for 40 years. "Unlike the previous government that signed 99 years lease agreements."
"Bringing in foreign investment should not be considered a crime. We will ensure the national security and the sovereignty of the country. The Mattala Airport has incurred Rs. 20 BN losses up to now," Minister De Silva said.
Referring to the allegations made by Opposition MPs, Minister De Silva observed that their comments are mostly political slogans. "We have served this country for a long time under different governments. We will not allow any harm come to this country from any foreign investment,." he said.
He said the government will not allow India even to bring in Indian air traffic controllers to work at the Airport.
Minister De Silva said the 70-30 per cent joint venture over the airport is a "good business deal. 70 per cent of the debts we have on this airport will be paid by the partner of the agreement."
Minister De Silva said the government advertised an expression of interest with regard to the Mattala Airport business venture. "Six companies responded including China and India. Many of the other investors were interested in establishing Flying schools. Indian proposal was the most promising among all others," he explained.
Transportation and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe joining the debate said the term used by the Joint Opposition when moving the adjournment motion is incorrect. "You have said it is on the selling of the Mattala Airport. But we are not selling it. So the terminology itself is wrong. This is not an outright sale, like you did under the previous regime,." he said.
State Minister Abeysinghe said the Mattala Airport incurs a annual loss of Rs. 1700 MN. "How do you expect us to pay these debts We are paying these debts from the income by the Katunayake Bandaranaike International Airport. We have to pay the debts for 15 years. So a joint venture as this is of utmost importance," he said.
Honest public servants do not have to fear NAC
Honest public servants do not have to fear the National Audit Act (NAC), Finance and Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna yesterday said joining the debate on the National Audit Bill.
We are taking up a very important bill today. Some people allege that this will hinder the development of the country. It is a wrong interpretation of the Audit Act. I find many public servants are very promising. They have been extremely dedicated to develop the country," he said.
"While many public servants execute their duties to their best of abilities, a few of them go astray. Because of these persons, the development is hindered. Honest public servants should not fear the Audit Act. We should not embrace fears of a minority in corruption. We would be able to use all the money saved by the Audit Act to develop the country, Deputy Minister Alagiyawanna said. The Deputy Minister said it was wrong to criticise any step taken to strengthen the Auditor Generals Department. "A solid Audit Act will strengthen Parliament as well," he said.
TNA demands to repeal PCs (A) Act No. 17 of 2017
The TNA demands that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 be repealed immediately enabling the holding of the Provincial Council Elections without further delay if the government fails to bring in reforms for the Act within next two months.
TNA MP MA Sumanthiran will present it to Parliament today as an adjournment motion.
The motion to be moved in the House for debate is as follows:
Whereas the terms of office of three Provincial Councils came to an end in October 2017.
And whereas no election to the three councils have been conducted to date owing to the fact that the Provincial Council Elections Act was amended to introduce reforms to the electoral process.
And whereas three more Provincial Councils will end their respective terms of office by October 2018.
No election to any Provincial Council can be held due to the fact that the electoral reforms are not yet complete.
An urgent priority has arisen to complete the electoral reforms, so that the franchise of the people of the several provinces is not denied any further.
We urge the government to complete the electoral reforms to the Provincial Councils Election laws immediately without any further delay.
And if it is not possible within the next two months, we urge that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 be repealed immediately, so that elections to the provincial councils can be held without any further postponement.
Granting positionS to politically victimised:
Take legal actions against any discrepancies: Akila
Take legal actions against any discrepancies if any happened when principals and officials were appointed from the victims of political revenge, without disrupting the education sector, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
"They can either lodge a complaint at the Public Services Commission or take them before courts, he said. Minister Kariyawasam said the government would not allow persons who made bunches of political appointments in the education sector to disrupt the sector.
Teachers associations and other trade unions in the education sector launched an island-wide strike against granting positions to victims of political revenge.
Minister Kariyawasam said that granting of these positions was done transparently. The Minister said the Public Services Commission received 12,000 appeals from the victims and 1,018 were appointed.
AG must have powers to investigate political parties funds: Ranjan
The Auditor General should be vested with the power to audit queries on political parties' funds, Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday said.
Minister Ramanayake said the AG should be given the power to directly order the IGP and the relevant police divisions to investigate if he comes across any financial crime.
Deputy Minister Ramanayake said the AG should be provisioned to examine political party funds as none of the parties reveal the money they get from various persons, and how they have spent these funds.
Joining in the debate on the National Audit Bill, Deputy Minister Ramanayake also said, the Auditor General should be given powers to examine where the parties get funds for their election campaigns, how much and how they have spent them as none of the parties come up with these details".
If so, the AG would have been able to carry out an investigation into The New York Times report that suggested that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa had received funds from a Chinese company for his presidential campaign. It would have also allowed to investigate the latest information that the Chinese Company which constructed the Hambantota Port had given USD 38 MN to Elle Gunawansa Thera and Rs. 18 million to the Pushpa Rajapaksa Foundation run by Basil Rajapaksas wife, he said.
He said examples should be drawn from the powers vested to the Kenyan Auditor General.
National Audit Bill will not prevent corruption: Handunnetti
The National Audit Bill was finally passed in Parliament in a highly watered down state and people should not place great hope that the Bill would put an end to corruption, waste and fraud in the country, JVP-MP Sunil Handunnetti said.
He was participating yesterday in the debate on the National Audit Bill. It was postponed several times earlier but taken for debate yesterday. The National Audit Bill is a key pledge of the Good Governance Government to be adopted within the first 100 days of it assuming power.
JVP MP Sunil Handunnetti told Parliament that when the National Audit Bill was drafted initially, it contained many provisions to prevent corruption. There was an undue delay and within that period, many potent factors of the Bill were stripped. Although it was portrayed as a strong arm against corruption, what we have today is a mere scarecrow. This is only a dummy of the original Bill. It has no powers, MP Handunnetti said.
It is the duty of Parliament to give life to this scarecrow. We have proposed 16 amendments to the Bill in this regard. If the government fails to incorporate them, then those waiting to rob the State institutions and continue on their path of corruption, need not worry about the Bill. If the Bill is passed in this state, even the Central Bank thieves will be given a maximum fine of Rs. 5,000. In the original Bill the maximum fine was Rs. 100,000 but that has now been reduced to Rs. 5,000," he said. "That happened because of the amendments brought in by the government. The worst of the bill is it contains provisions to narrow down the scope of the Auditor General. Several subjects have been taken out from his auditing scope. Could anyone against corruption and frauds expect anything worse than that he asked.
Responding to Handunnettis allegation, Higher Education Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said not to demean the Bill in this way. "The Bill will not overpower the existing Acts and their provisions. For the issues that you raise, the Penal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure still exist, he said.

Pet food - an environmental disaster
A quarter of the impact of meat production comes from the pet-food industry. Has the time come to change what we feed our dogs and cats
Animal microbiologist Holly Ganz cannot talk about the pet feeding regime known as biologically appropriate raw food without laughing. The increasingly popular diet is known by its unfortunate acronym, Barf. Its bizarrely named, she says.
It certainly runs contrary to the twee language usually reserved for the pet realm; such as Kitty Biome, a project Ganz recently raised $23,000 (17,000) for via Kickstarter, which invited cat owners to pay $100 to have the microorganisms in their cats droppings analysed. The common term for the environmental impact of pet-keeping has a cute name too: pawprint. But, with humans increasingly demanding human-grade meat for their four-legged family members, pet food is estimated to be responsible for a quarter of the environmental impacts of meat production in terms of the use of land, water, fossil fuels, phosphates and pesticides. And this trend for raw food is, environmentally speaking, a step backwards.
It is this carbon pawprint that Ganz is working to reduce. She has been drafted in to assess the gut-friendliness of a vegan pet-food product launching in the US in July called Wild Earth.
Its first offering is a dog treat made from what the blurb calls an ancient Asian fungi called koji. Were hoping, she says, that it will support bacteria that will help to fight inflammation and maintain healthy digestion and nutrition.
Ask Wild Earths CEO, Ryan Bethencourt, what the future of pet food looks like and he has one word: Massive. In 2017, the global pet-food market was worth $94bn, and it is projected to grow even further as new markets open up. In China, where pet ownership is rare, the market grew by 100 per cent last year. If China follows the trends, we are going to see hundreds of millions more pets in existence, says Bethencourt.
In the meantime, can eco-conscious cats and dogs survive on a vegan diet Cats are obligate carnivores, says Ganz, which means a lot of what they need comes from meat, whereas dogs are more scavengers and have amylase genes so they can digest starch. But even a scientifically designed vegan or vegetarian diet for dogs, says Ganz, can be difficult to devise.
Just as in humans, a diverse diet is the route to a healthy gut, and eating the same food all the time means pets are more likely to develop food allergies, says Ganz. She rotates different meats for her dogs, but says these are just debates  we dont have answers.
However, in bad news for the planet, many of her customers report positive results from shifting to the Barf diet. The idea is that youre feeding the animal food similar to its natural diet. What cats would have eaten up until the 20th century was mice and birds.
By far the biggest dietary issue for pets, though, is being overweight. Were over feeding our cats, says Ravetz.
We may be feeding them the right amount of cat or dog food, but then giving them treats, coupled with more animals being left at home for long periods of time, and this could correlate to less exercise.
Instead of reaching for the treats, which is also bad for their pawprint, Ravetz suggests other rewards such as playing with them, taking them for a walk, stroking them or letting them sit on your knee.
Wild Earth will be introducing a wet dog food and, eventually, aims to work nutritional variety into the range. Right now, we think its a really clean protein source and thats a really good place to start, he says. If you look at most dogs diets, theyre not diverse.
The ultimate vegan pet food, says Ganz, would be if they could lab-grow a carcass. Cats and dogs need the blood, the bones and organs, not just the muscle meat. But for the moment, thats still a tall order.

PHDT spends Rs 1.4 bn for housing, infrastructure development in 2017
The Plantations Human Development Trust (PHDT) has invested Rs. 1.4 billion in estate housing and infrastructure development projects during 2017.
PHDT that implements social development programmes to enhance the quality of life of the estate communities is made of a tripartite coalition of Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), Plantation Trade Unions (TU) and the Government of Sri Lanka (GOSL).
During 2017, the organisation oversaw the completion of 1,045 houses where each unit is constructed and handed over to residents as a completed house with space for living area, two rooms, a verandah and a kitchen, together with a separate tiled bathroom.
Our vision for the PHDTs civil engineering projects was to create a sense of belonging and ownership among the estate community by providing them with a fully realized space to make into a home.
Each house has been designed to incorporate concepts of sustainability through the allocation of space for small-scale agriculture, the addition of solar panels, rain water harvesting, environmental friendly garbage disposal units and waste water management systems, to transform these units to meet the PHDTs concept of farmer driven housing PHDT, Director General, Lal Perera explained.
Included in 2017s housing projects were 406 disaster relief housing units, 136 owner driven housing and 100 units undertaken as a pilot project a pre-fabricated housing  a first for the plantations sector.
Meanwhile, Existing lines of houses in Galle, Ratnapura, Badulla, Kegalle, Kandy, Hatton and Nuwara Eliya were re-roofed as an interim measure until construction of new housing units are completed and delivered to residents.
In total, the PHDT invested Rs. 76 million towards re-roofing of 1,621 units as part of a Rs. 215 million invested in special projects. These special projects consist of new water schemes, sanitation and hygiene (WASH) facilities, upgrading community halls, playgrounds,Child Development Centres and concrete roads in order to improve connectivity between estate communities and urban centers.
During the year, PHDT also worked in partnership with the World Bank under the Water Supply and Sanitation Improvement Project facilitating investments towards the replacement of public toilets with 432 individual toilets provided to each worker while another 1,250 new toilets are approved for construction with a Rs. 500 million investment, offering a much needed measure of convenience and improved sanitation conditions for estate residents.

Shipping and freight forwarding sector
Proposed ownership restriction  removal praised
Maersk Line Managing Director- South Asia Steve M. Felder urged to fully liberalize the ownership on the shipping and freight forwarding agencies in Sri Lanka to bring in additional investments and benefits to the country and to achieve its strategic locational advantage.
Expressing satisfaction over Sri Lankan governments budget proposal for the removal of ban on foreign ownership of shipping and freight forwarding firms, Felder emphasised the importance of implementing this proposal without any delay to enable major international shipping lines and logistics operators to base their operations in Sri Lanka.
He made these comments speaking at a press briefing, held in Colombo yesterday. Ownership of local shipping and freight forwarding industry is structured against free market policy. Sri Lanka is one of the few countries that stand out as having not liberalized the sector as of yet, Felder noted.
We always believe in free market activities. When Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera announced in his budget speech that the government intends to liberalize the ownership structure within the shipping and freight forwarding industry, we expressed our support in this regard.
We would like to see that process go to conclusion stage. It will also send a strong signal to the world that Sri Lanka is open for business and also ensure healthy competition. We certainly see this as a win-win situation and we dont see any losers in this process.Felder also noted that if the liberalization does take place as planned, Maersk will consult its partners with regard to future growth plans in Sri Lanka.
But its a bit premature to say what we will do in Sri Lanka.
He also highlighted the need to continually develop deep draft capacity of the Colombo port, noting that it will provide more headroom for growth.
Speaking on growth in trade in Sri Lankan market, Felder noted that growth has been fairly moderate in terms of cargo handling and on the exports side, the company has recorded a 5% growth year on year.
On imports side, the company saw around 2% growth during the first quarter of this year versus first quarter of last year. According to Felder, imports have grown at a slower rate due to rupee depreciation.
Felder also commented on recent policy changes in India on cabotage law, noting that India has relaxed the cabotage rules to allow transshipping export-import cargo at Indian ports. This will help India develop its coastal shipments and attract more containerised cargo on its ports.
By relaxing these rules, India is planning to build a successful transshipment hub by attracting more containerised cargo by reducing time and cost for mainline vessels that now transship containers at neighbouring hub ports.

Based on the previous year experience our management has come forward to undertake the Gold Sponsorship of Construct 2018.
Jayasinghe said that this is a crucial time for the construction industry. According to the present business climate in the country, the construction sector is also facing setbacks in business and even the domestic sector contribution shows a substantial decline. We believe at a time like this price wars, severe inter-rival competition, additional credit, reducing advertising budget. However, we think this is the time we must shout more about our products and elaborate on their benefits and showcase your products more. Because of this we want to come forward in large scale sponsorships of these kinds of leading exhibitions in the country.
We are the market leader of the roofing segment of the country and we manufacture well-known brands such as Rhino; corrugated roofing and flat ceiling sheets. South East Asias largest machine painted brand of colored roofing and ceiling sheets  Color up and the Heritage brand of machine painted tile designs and corrugated roofing sheets, he said.
Jayasinghe further said that we are in the roofing business for the last 5 decades and we have maintained the market leadership for more than 15years. It is not easy to sustain the market leadership if any organization is not manufacturing high quality products. We are very much concerned about manufacturing excellent quality products, providing brilliant pre and post customer service and practice 7Ps in marketing.
With all these ingredients we will not just satisfy the customer, but we want to delight the customer as well and retain the market leadership in business.
Jayasinghe thanked the National Construction Association, its management and the members for trusting Rhino Roofing and wished that their objectives will become a reality at this exhibition. We believe this exhibition will definitely be an excellent platform for manufacturers, industry related other stake holders and customers as well.

The event was organised by the Public Enterprise Department and the Finance and Mass Media Ministry to equip the Heads of State Owned Enterprises (SOEs) with the operational aspects on certain financial and administrative instruments.
Minister Samaraweera also said that many of the SOEs are managing vital economic activities in Sri Lanka such as public transport, public utilities and services. Their conduct of business plays an essential role in the daily life of the people, together with the productive performance of the countrys national economy. The Minister further said that in the Vision 2025 document, the governments policy on the management of public enterprises that proposes to eliminate unproductive expenditure is envisaged in which it pledged to restructure SOEs to enable them to operate as commercially viable ventures with accountability.
During 2017, 55 public ventures alone have recorded a total turnover of nearly Rs.1, 800 billion which was almost 13.22 percent of the GDP. Out of the 55 SOEs, 39 recorded a net profit amounting to Rs.136 billion while 16 made net losses amounting to Rs. 87 billion in 2017. The total asset base of SOEs grew by 13.6 percent in 2017 over 2016 and it accounted for almost 56.8 percent of the GDP, Minister Samaraweera said.
However, despite their strategic importance, SOEs have not achieved
full potential, which is reflected by its low Return Over Assets (ROA) ratio at 0.64 percent, Minister Samaraweera said.
The reasons for such underperformance range from lack of Good Governance practices, including lack of a clear accountability mechanism, policy and legal framework, to a weak supervisory role. I encourage you to address those difficult, but serious issues at your deliberations today. The Minister also said that the performance of some SOEs in the recent years has been a source of concern for the fiscal balance. He added that total government revenue in 2017 declined from 14.2 percent to 13.8 percent, influenced by a drop of revenue from SOEs reaching a 50 percent decline in dividends and levies as compared to 2016. In 2017, four of the main loss making SOEs specially Ceylon Electricity Board, SriLankan Airlines, Sathosa and Agriculture and Agrarian Insurance Board combined in losses amounting to Rs.84 billion.
I may say this as a dismal performance that creates public outcry over the mismanagement of our national resources, Minister Samaraweera said.
The Minister also said that given the importance of the SOEs, the governments strategy is to encourage and facilitate the SOEs to be self-sufficient through improved corporate practices, management reforms, innovative financing, strong and prudent financial management, exposure to competitiveness and international best-practices and effective human resource management, while enhancing public accountability. It is pertinent that 2018 Budget allocated funds to operationalise the National Agency for Public Private Partnership (NAPPP), which would be the single facilitation point for all stakeholders in designing and implementing PPPs.
He added that the SOEs must now make efforts to closely work with the NAPPP in compliance with the PPP initiatives to gain the strength of the private sector to remain viable business operations.
The Department of Public Enterprises (DPE) has adopted a new approach with the introduction of the Statements of Corporate Intents (SCIs) to support your entities, Minister Samaraweera said.
The SCI is a statement that contains key performance indicators targeting the core activities of the entity which will be reflected in improved financial and non-financial performance. During 2017, five key SOEs became party to the SCI, having signed tripartite agreements. I encourage all of you to follow suit without any delay.
We cannot pass on the cost of inefficiency on to the consumer or the public and therefore, it is essential that SOEs eliminate management inefficiencies prior to the implementation of fully cost reflective pricing, the Minister said.
As the key players in our national ventures, you may have to relook at your operations seriously to achieve reasonable management improvements in the interest of our fellow citizens, the Minister added.
Minister Samaraweera also said that the objectives of the entity should be achieved effectively and efficiently having utilized the available resources. He added it was important that the Boards and the senior management exhibit due diligence given that the resources under their custody are non-other than public property.
It is noted that you are vested with a responsibility to ensure that the entities operate as commercially viable having exercised best business practices. This demands the appointment of personnel who are properly qualified and have the capacity to guide your entities to achieve their objectives. In this context the Treasury envisages conducting awareness programs for the members of Boards and the senior management on the best practices that must be adopted in guiding the operations of these entities, Minister Samaraweera said. I expect to see a marked improvement in your performance in the ensuing year to bring our economy to greater heights.
Australian High Commissioner Bryce Hutchesson, Secretary to the Treasury Dr. R.H.S. Samarathunga also spoke.
Finance and Mass Media Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was also present at the occasion.

## Title: SEA TURTLE HATCHERIES
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, July 6, 2018 - 01:00
SEA TURTLE HATCHERIES
The World Sea Turtle Day 2018 was celebrated on June 16, emphasizing the importance of saving these ancient mariners that have dwelled the oceans over 100 million years. Every year these magnetic hearted navigators cross thousand seas to reach the sandy beaches of Sri Lanka faithfully looking for their birth place and a safe haven for their hatchlings.
Of the seven sea turtle species in the world, five of them come to Sri Lankan shores for nesting. Those species include Loggerhead (Carettacaretta), Hawksbill (Eretmochelysimbricata), Green (Cheloniamydas), Olive Ridleys (Lepidochelyaolivaecea) and Leatherback (Dermochelyscoriacea). According to the World Wildlife Organization, all species of sea turtles are classified endangered. They are slaughtered for their meat, eggs, skin, shell and their existence is threatened by poaching and over exploitation. WWO observes that habitat destruction, accidental captures in fish gear and climate changes have drastic effects on the sea turtle population.
In the public eye, sea turtle hatcheries have become sanctuaries that provide safety to these sea turtles from human or otherwise predators and environmental hazards.
Sea turtle tourism
Daily News spoke to several local and foreign tourists who visited these sea turtle hatcheries and most of them sounded blown away by the experience. Few among them took time to be a little more specific than others. According to Gabriel, an Australian citizen, father of two kids, said that his family enjoyed every minute there and the kids especially loved releasing the turtles into the water. However, we had to pay 1,500 SLR per person. he chuckled.
Kristine, 29, spoke with a little discomfort when she said donating money to hatcheries when releasing baby turtles at any given time of the day didnt seem quite correct. She wasnt sure the big sea turtle they released would be caught again by the same people, because the sea turtle looked almost the same! that was in some other pictures at the hatchery. Upuli, a grade nine student who has recently visited a sea turtle hatchery said that they were able to touch baby turtles that were 2 to 3 days old. She chirped, They were only three days old! Mitchel, a volunteer, who happened to have visited a sea turtle hatchery in the recent past said when she arrived at the hatchery about a hundred of baby sea turtles who have hatched a few days ago, were swimming in small tanks. After four or five days, I went back to see these hatchlings getting released back to the sea.
The darker side of the trade
While these comments seemingly do not raise any alarms, Environmentalist Supun Jayaweera says things are not as rosy as they seem to be. Jayaweera, voicing his concerns on the matter says that ever so popular sea turtle hatcheries only use sea turtle conservation as a catchy slogan to attract local and foreign tourists. Jayaweera calls majority of these hatcheries rackets that dodge all good practices of a proper conservation project. He furthers that these so called hatcheries are functional thanks to political interferences. Absence of monitoring topped with political infiltration over the past decade or so has paved way for the hatchery owners to act according to their own whims and fancies.
One can easily find hundreds of these so called sea turtle conservation centers scattered all over the southern and western coastal line of the country. These places have two or three cement tanks and they call themselves sea turtle conservation centers. But they are just profiteers. They have done this for almost two decades now, unauthorized and politically backed up. Jayaweera pointed out.
According to Jayaweera, these sea turtle hatcheries pay for the sea turtle eggs collected by fishermen and roughs in the surrounding areas. As it is reported, a sea turtle egg is sold for approximately Rs. 30, however, the price apparently changes according to the species. Even though the act seems harmless, Jayaweera says this gives rise to a chain of misfortunes. He points out that the sex ratio of the sea turtles has undergone drastic imbalances due to unsystematic digging up of eggs from their natural nests. According to Jayaweera, 97 percent of the hatchlings coming out of these hatcheries happen to be males, which is a major sex ratio imbalance. Poor conditions of the hatcheries are extremely unhealthy for the sea turtles kept at these places, Jayaweera also said. The hatcheries are also violating the Fauna and Flora Ordinance by not abiding by its provisions, Jayaweera also pointed out.
Unregulated
Professor Devaka Weerakoon of the Zoology Department, Colombo University responding to queries by the Daily News in relation to the above concerns, pointed out that absence of proper regulations on sea turtle hatcheries has created a cobra effect.
On one hand, sea turtle hatcheries are a reasonable initiative for the conservation of these precious creatures. Before, people used to predate on these eggs. The concept of sea turtle hatcheries was developed to convert potential exploiters to conservationists. In that aspect it was a positive measure. When the hatcheries were introduced, the number of hatchlings that go into the waters tremendously increased. But unfortunately, what we are lacking here is proper regulation. Professor Weerakoon pointed out.
Speaking of the removal of sea turtle eggs from their natural nests, Professor Weerakoon said that egg collectors lack basic awareness on protocols to follow when removing eggs.
The sexes of sea turtles are defined by the temperature to which the eggs are exposed. The temperature will be decided by how deep the eggs are buried, when mother sea turtle dig the beach and lay eggs, she deposit them in a certain balanced pattern. If we just dig it up and randomly incubate these eggs, they will result in complete different sexuation than what was intended by sea turtle mother. Professor Weerakoon explained.
He pointed out that technically there are two methods to conserve the eggs laid by sea turtle mothers on natural beaches. First method would be to protect the nests as they are, and it is the ideal situation. But there comes times when these eggs need to be removed from their original location. Then this problem we discussed earlier arises, because one has to dig up these eggs and re-burry them. However, if we dont follow protocol the sea turtle mother has followed, we will probably not reach the same depth she has laid her eggs. Hence the temperature of the eggs will change and affect the sexual ratio of the hatchlings. he further explained.
This is one of the issues that we have to overcome by proper training. These people just randomly collect eggs, they dont know the proper procedure to follow. Professor Weerakoon added.
Professor Weerakoon also said that studies have found out that the sea turtles have a unique physical feature to identify the location of their nesting grounds. Accordingly, the sea turtles have the ability to imprint on their birth beach. The ability to memorize the characteristics of their birth beach allows them to return to these places. He also pointed out that the hatchlings, as soon as they are born, scurry towards the water, get in and swim. The condition is called juvenile frenzy. The hatchlings have a natural store of energy given to them by the egg yolk, which last for 48 hours. This energy gives them strength to survive the waves. However, when the hatcheries keep these hatchlings in cement tanks for days, they neither can memorize the beaches they were born at nor can they survive the waters without the energy they had stored in their bodies. According to many visitors who have been to sea turtle hatcheries, they were allowed to release the hatchlings into the water during the afternoons, whereas the ideal time for the hatchlings to go into the waters is the night time.
So these are some of the issues relating to sea turtle hatcheries. I believe the whole conservation process we have here needs to be properly regularized. These hatcheries definitely are doing something, but not the right thing. The responsibility of monitoring these hatcheries falls under the purview of the Wildlife Department. So DWC must monitor if they follow the protocols correctly. What should be done is not bringing pressure on the hatcheries, but making sure the procedure is followed, Professor Weerakoon said.
The Daily News also spoke to Senior Environmental lawyer Jagath Gunawardena who explained the legal position of the matter in concern.
Usually no one is allowed to take eggs or keep eggs in possession or under custody of anyone because the sea turtle is a strictly protected category of animals. But there are always exceptions where the action is for the sake of conservation or the study of a species. So certain actions that would be otherwise illegal could be permitted by the Wildlife Conservation Department under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance. So the sea turtle hatcheries are allowed under that exception. So these hatcheries can be allowed under certain conditions by the DWC. Gunawardena explained.
However, Gunawardena pointed out that the hatcheries only receive an authorization from the DWC to operate. It is an authorization, not a license. A license is issued to an action that is permitted, but an authorization is given as a special provision to an action that is otherwise prohibited. It is not something that a person can ask as a right. It is an exceptional provision offered to people. he furthered. Gunawardena pointed out that the hatchery owners should exercise this privilege with utmost caution and care.
According to Gunawardena, there are two important conditions to which all the sea turtle hatcheries are subjected to. One condition is to release the hatchlings within a particular time period after they hatch. Another condition is that they cannot run a commercial venture with these animals as an attraction.
Queried if the DWC monitor the privately owned hatcheries, Gunawardena said that he is unaware of the particulars. But there have been many concerns over the years, particularly on political interferences. At present, I am unaware of the situation, whether DWC head office or if it is the newly established Marine Unit or the regional DWC divisions are responsible in monitoring these hatcheries. he said.
If someone violates the guidelines, the best cause of action is to invalidate the authorization given to that hatchery, Gunawardena continued. If they continue to operate illegally they can be taken to task under the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance.
Asked as to who can take legal action against hatcheries that do not abide by the conditions spelled out in the authorization, Gunawardena said that the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance provisions any member of the public to take legal action against such a breach. They can initially inform the DWC of the breach in writing and if the department fails to take any action for 60 days, the person who lodged the complaint can take a private plaintiff to the Magistrate Court.
Sea Turtle Survey
The Daily News spoke to the Assistant Director, Marine Protection Unit of the DWC Channa Suraweera who said that the sea turtle conservation projects initiated or monitored by the DWC in all national parks such as Kumana, Boondala and Kalametiya are strictly functioning under regulations. He said that most of these conservation projects protect the natural nests without causing any disturbances to the eggs. If predators are in excess, we remove and re-burry the eggs methodically, he further said. According to him most private hatcheries allegedly do not abide by the authorizations issued to them. He added that there has been a survey in year 2016 as to how many private hatcheries exist in the country. According to the data collected by this survey, only 15-17 privately owned authorized hatcheries exist in the country, however, a walk down the coast of Mount Lavinia will prove these statistics wrong. So either these other hatcheries are not legal or have not being included in the survey, and the authorities are provisioned to find it out.
Suraweera also said that plans are afoot for a survey on sea turtles that are reaching Sri Lankan beaches. The survey will commence by the end of this year, he said. Accordingly, the survey will be carried out throughout the year 2019. He said that no data are available on sea turtles that reach the northern beaches. The survey will focus on period of times each sea turtle species reach Sri Lankan beaches for nesting, which beaches they reach most and their nesting behaviours. He also said that the DWC hopes to tag the sea turtles that reach Sri Lankan beaches to monitor and study their migration patterns.

SME Board important complement  to Enterprise Sri Lanka
The Small and Medium Enterprise Board (SME Board) will be an important complement to the Enterprise Sri Lanka initiative that was launched recently with the aim of developing entrepreneurs and the SME sector of the country, said Minister of Finance and Media Mangala Samaraweera, at the launching of Empower the Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) Board at the BMICH yesterday.
For too long Sri Lanka has relied on a State led model of economic growth. This has resulted in a plethora of State owned enterprises, many of which are a burden on the treasury, and use up valuable economic resources. It has also contributed to attitudes of citizens expecting the State to provide everything from jobs to all manner of subsidies. Our government intends to reverse this economic model and change this mindset. In fact, it is not a new mindset, but a reawakening of Sri Lankas ancient tradition of trade and enterprise.
The Minister said that entrepreneurs play a key role in any economy and the growth of economy should be driven by private enterprise. The role of the State is to facilitate such entrepreneurs and provide them the required support to grow their business. This model of economic growth is far more sustainable than one led by debt fueled State led growth.
In order to develop a growth model driven by private enterprise, the government needs to establish robust institutions, simplified procedures and affordable access to the factors of production, land, labour, and capital, he said.
Samaraweera said access to factors of production can be challenging for SMEs. The 2018 budget has proposed a number of measures to liberalise factor markets including land and labour. These are being implemented with regular monitoring by the ministry.
We hope to address this through 15 tailor-made concessional loan schemes under the umbrella of Enterprise Sri Lanka. The lack of collateral is another issue faced by young entrepreneurs and small business. Through the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan schemes we are encouraging banks to lend based on the quality of the business plan and expected cash flows.
The Minister said in addition the government will soon be introducing the SME guarantee fund which will be another avenue for SMEs to borrow without physical collateral. The next step for Sri Lankan entrepreneurs and the start-up economy is to graduate to the capital markets. The SME Board of the Colombo Stock Exchange can play a crucial role in enabling such young companies to take their first steps into capital markets and raise equity funding to grow to the next level.The launch of the SME Board is a crucial step in the evolution and development of Sri Lankas capital markets. It will also play a major role in expanding access to finance in Sri Lanka, he said.
Enterprise Sri Lanka was launched by Colombo Stock Exchange and Securities and Exchange Commission with the objective of enhancing the access to capital for entrepreneurs and SMEs. (SS)

Suspended RI for culpable homicide
Galle High Court Judge Manjula Thilakarathne sentenced two suspects of a homicide case to Rigorous Imprisonment of 18 years and 6 months respectively for the second and first respondents.
They were both fined Rs. 5,000 each and in the event of failure to pay the fine, the first respondent was sentenced to RI for another 3 months and the second respondent to 6 months more.
Those imprisoned were Pasqual Handi Suraj Kavinda Silva and Kogge Gihan Kumara.
The second respondent evaded presence in courts since the beginning of the case. However, while delivering the order, the High Court Judge blamed the OIC of Rathgama for not executing the warrants issued against the second respondent for a long time.
The second accused dodged presence in courts since the commencement of the case and he had been issued warrants by both the Galle Magistrate Court and the High Court. Moreover, the High Court ordered the Rathgama police OIC to appear in courts on August 2.
The duo had been indicted for causing the death of Malinga Alwis Manawadu by stabbing at Pitiwella, Boossa in the Rathgama police division on July 24 and causing injuries to Denagamage Indika in the same criminal act.
The crime had occurred at a hotel when two victims had come for meals to the place after taking part in a function around 11 pm on the day of the incident.
In his verdict, the High Court judge stated that the second respondent had contributed more towards committing the crime and thus he was imprisoned for 18 years as he was found guilty for culpable homicide not amounting to a murder.
The first respondent was given a suspended jail term by the judge in consideration of the time he spent in remand prison. State Counselor K.V. Indika prosecuted.

The first ever Inter Lyceum Choral Speaking Competition Voice it held recently, saw the branches of Lyceum put on a spectacular and extraordinary display of talent when students from these different branches got on stage and wowed the audience with their poetic prowess. It was marvelous for anyone who watched, in what can be termed a praiseworthy and noble effort. It was an experience that these young ones will truly benefit from and in the end they were all winners.
Choral speaking is a very old genre of performance. It goes back over 2500 years, when in Ancient Greece the Chorals were an essential and intrinsic part of any performance. Poetry is itself a powerful platform to inspire, narrate and motivate the reader and listener to think, feel and learn.

Tobacco expenditure surpasses GSP Plus export income, milk powder bill
The Sri Lankan consumers annual expenditure on cigarettes and tobacco is so high that it surpasses the countrys annual bill on milk powder imports, said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen.
The tobacco expenditure also exceeds another income - the annual export revenue from EU GSP Plus.
Reports say that Sri Lankan consumers spend more than Rs. 200 million per day for cigarettes. According to the World Health Organization in 2015, the direct and indirect cost of tobacco use in Sri Lanka was estimated at Rs. 89 billion or US$ 662 million, said the minister.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the launch of the tobacco farmer research report titled Farmer Perspectives on Proposed Tobacco Growing Ban and Opportunity to Diversify, by Dr. Chatura Rodrigo of Green Space Consultancies (GSC) recently.
We spend more than $ 660 million annually for tobacco and resulting expenses. When we compare $ 660 million with other important values, we can understand the huge cost for the economy due to tobacco use, said Minister Bathiudeen.
He added: For example, we spend US$ 400 million a year to import milk powder to be used by our households and hotels. The $660 million we spend for tobacco use is 55 percent higher than our annual bill for milk powder imports. The other example is that Sri Lankas annual expenditure on tobacco use is even higher than the additional export income from EU GSP plus which is around $480 million. In that, our annual tobacco and cigarette expenditure is 37 percent higher than our annual GSP Plus income alone.
Another example is that this annual tobacco cost is equal to total flood and landslide damages incurred by Sri Lanka in both 2015 and 2016. These simple examples show the huge cost to our economy due to tobacco use. Therefore, the government is making attempts to switch the tobacco economy to a more productive livelihood stream with alternative, export driven crops.
As for tobacco production, it is reported that more than 3300 metric tonnes of tobacco are produced in Sri Lanka.
The tobacco expert panel at the event said tobacco is considered as an industrial crop, more than a commercial crop and since the bulk of the harvest is used for nicotine products, it immediately ends up in industrial/machine processing, unlike many other commercial crops. Among all types of full-time farmers in Sri Lanka, tobacco farmers are one of the most profitable, earning regular margins of 20 percent or higher.
The ban on tobacco cultivation in Sri Lanka is scheduled to start from 2020. The importation of cigarettes and tobacco will also be banned from 2020.

West Indies dismiss Bangladesh for record Test low of 43
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, Wednesday - Kemar Roach led the demolition of Bangladesh with a five-wicket haul as the tourists were dismissed for 43, their lowest total ever in Test cricket, before lunch on the opening day of the first Test against the West Indies at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Wednesday.
By stumps the West Indies top-order had built on that dominant bowling effort in reaching 201 for two, a lead already of 158 runs with eight wickets in hand.
Opening batsman Kraigg Brathwaite played his usual sheet-anchor role to perfection in compiling an unbeaten 88 from almost five hours at the crease.
He put on 113 for the first wicket with Devon Smith (58), while Kieran Powell stroked his way to 48 in an 81-run stand before falling just before the close of play.
Their serene progress through two sessions contrasted sharply with Bangladesh's woeful batting performance.
Apart from being their lowest Test innings total and lowest for any team in Test cricket in the Caribbean, it was also the second shortest first innings of a Test match - 18.4 overs  in the game's 141-year history, bettering by just one delivery Australia's dismissal for 60 off 18.3 overs by England at Nottingham in 2015.
Put in to bat on the greenest surface seen in 10 years of Test cricket at the venue, the Bangladeshis were no match for the quality of the West Indies fast bowling led by Roach, who set the rout in motion by claiming the first five wickets for eight runs in the space of 12 deliveries despite appearing to be troubled by a muscular strain behind his right knee.
However, it was the visiting batsmen who felt the greatest discomfort with only opener Liton Das getting into double-figures in a performance that once again exposed the vulnerability of their players in conditions away from what they are generally familiar with on the Indian sub-continent.
Das was sixth out for 25, an ugly heave offering a simple catch to Roston Chase at backward point off Miguel Cummins to end any prospect of Roach claiming all ten wickets in the innings.
Cummins, whose place in the final XI was in question after a lack of success in the preceding three-Test series against Sri Lanka, took two more wickets before West Indies captain Jason Holder, fresh from a nine-wicket haul despite defeat in the final Test against the Sri Lankans in Barbados just over a week earlier, polished off the innings with the wickets of Kamrul Islam and debutant Abu Jayed.
Jayed was always in line for his maiden Test cap given the pitch conditions and the absence through injury from the tour of Bangladesh's most effective seamer Mustafizur Rahman.
But he would not have expected to be at the crease as the last man in the batting line-up or being the first to use the new ball in the West Indies reply, all within his very first session of Test cricket.
If they were relying on their most senior players to navigate them through what was expected to be a tough opening session, Bangladesh were poorly served by the experienced quartet as captain Shakib al Hassan, former skipper Musfiqur Rahim and all-rounder Mahmudullah all failed to score while opener Tamim Iqbal contributed four runs before becoming the first wicket to fall, caught by wicketkeeper Shan Dowrich, to trigger the swift tumbling of wickets.
Four days after his 30th birthday, Roach's unerring accuracy and decent pace proved too much for batsmen ill-equipped to cope with the seaming ball.
Four of his five wickets came via catches to the wicketkeeper or the slip cordon, while Mushfiqur was trapped LBW, a review of the on-field decision being upheld by the television official.
Bangladesh's bowlers were made to look pedestrian in the conditions and their plight was worsened by chances put down off both Smith and Brathwaite. Yet there was delight on an otherwise forgettable first day of Test cricket for Abu Jayed when he had Smith caught at the wicket to claim his maiden Test success. Mahmudullah was the other wicket-taker, removing Powell to a deflected slip catch 15 minutes before stumps. - AFP
