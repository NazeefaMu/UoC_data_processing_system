Commission on SriLankan, SriLankan Catering and Mihin Lanka
Mihin received Rs.300 mn from LankaPuthra in 2006
Even before Cabinet approval was granted for the setting up of Mihin Lanka Ltd, the Lankaputra Development Bank had given Rs.300 million out of its capital to Mihin Lanka, flouting the banks usual procedure on the mere strength of a letter sent by the Presidential Secretariat.
Acting General Manager of the Lankaputra Development Bank Ranjith Dissanayake disclosed this in his evidence before the Presidential Commission investigating alleged Fraud, Corruption and Misappropriation of State Funds and properties in SriLankan Airlines, SriLanka Catering Services and Mhinn Lanka on October 12.
Cross-examined by Additional Solicitor General Neil Unamboowe PC, witness Dissanayake said the said letter dated November 22, 2006 was addressed to then Chairman of the Lankaputra Development Bank, A. De Vaas Gunewardena by Gamini Senarath, Additional Secretary to President Mahinda Rajapaksa at that time.
The Rs. 300 million was provided to Mihin Lanka from the Rs. 1.5 billion capital funds released to the Lankaputra development Bank, Dissanayake said.
He said this was the first time the bank had made such a large investment since its inception.
Apart from this, another short term loan of Rs.425 million was granted to Mihin Lanka as a bank guarantee even before one year had elapsed after the inception of the bank.
Although the Rs. 300 million had been requested in the name of Mihin Air Private Ltd, the money had been released to an institution called Mihin Lanka Pvt Ltd while the loan had been obtained for a firm which had no clear name.
The money had been released flouting the normal bank procedure of going through a loan application, feasibility report, assessment report, business plan and a Board Paper, witness accepted before the Commission.
He said Cabinet approval had been granted for setting up Mihin Lanka on December 20, 2006, but this transaction between the bank and the airline had occurred much before that due to a father-son relationship.
Chairman Lankaputra Development Bank A. de Vaas Gunewardena was the father of Mihin Lanka Director Sajin de Vaas Gunawardena.
The witness submitting relevant documents said the Board of Directors of Mihin Lanka launched on October 23, 2006 prior to obtaining Cabinet approval included Nandasena Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, Punchibanda Jayasundera, Roshan Mahes Gunateilleke and Sajin Vaas Gunawardena.
Lankaputra Development Bank and Mihin Lanka had signed a financial agreement on January 11, 2007 and the signatories had been Chairman A.de Vaas Gunawardena and Chief Executive S. Cooray on behalf of Lankaputra Development Bank, while a rubber stamp of two directors had been placed on behalf of Mihin Lanka. There was no official Mihin Lanka frank on the document.
The messages issued on behalf of Lankaputra Development by former Chairman A.de Vaas Gunawardena and Chief Executive Mrs. Shiromi Wickremasinghe to mark its inauguration were also receive by the Commission. They stated that since the rural masses had been neglected, the bank was set up under the Mahinda Chinthana programme to achieve the vision of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in catering to them.

Pensioners must be honoured
Retirees have sacrificed a lot to build the country and many of them still serve, State Administration, Management and Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara said.
He was addressing the gathering at the National Pensioners' Day celebration at the Kalutara District Secretariat Auditorium on October 8.
The Minister said October 8 was made the National Pensioners' Day to appreciate and honour the retirees who sacrificed and dedicated their services to develop the motherland.
Sri Lanka has 6,12,742 retirees and Rs. 130 billion was allocated to pay them pensions and it will be Rs. 232 billion in 2015, the Minister said.
Rs. 333 billion will be allocated for the purpose by 2020, the Minister said.
Chairman of the State Service Pensioners' Treasury Fund P.A. Ariyaratna said pensioners had been serving the country over 30 years. They do not receive a good pension now and cannot face the cost of living. "I urge the government to grant them a pension so they can meet their daily needs. Retirees of the State service must be given at least Rs. 5,000 increment," he said.
Director General of the Department of Pension A. Jagath Dias said 612,782 pensoners have been registered with the Department. "Every month about 2,400 retirees join it. The government pays what is due to pensioners without delay. Many think that they can win their demands by struggles, but it is impossible," he said.
Kalutara GA U.D.C. Jayalal said Kalutara has over 41,000 pensioners. He wished them long life.

Amaraweera debunks Caretaker Government
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera yesterday debunked the idea of a Caretaker Government arrangement noting that it was a deliberate lie to mislead the public and create political instability.
Formation of a Caretaker Government has become a hot topic these days. But we have no idea about who is spreading this lie. A new government could only be formed after an election and not by conspiring, he added.
United Peoples Freedom Alliance General Secretary Amaraweera said there was no discussion between the UPFA and the Joint Opposition(JO) group about such an arrangement as reported by some media and added that the Unity Government will complete its full term.
Minister Amaraweera further said that both the Presidential election and the Parliamentary election after that will be held on time and there will not be any changes in the government before that.
Meanwhile, State Minister Ajith P. Perera shot down rumours of a possible Caretaker Government being formed noting they were canards to create political instability.
Perera said these rumours are being spread by some Joint Opposition members facing charges of corruption and malpractices to divert the attention of the people.
He said these JO members were also targeting the countrys economy and were trying to scuttle foreign investments.
He also questioned as to how the JO will muster a majority in Parliament and added even the other opposition parties will not support the JO to form a caretaker government, win a No-Confidence Motion or defeat the budget.

Cabinet Secretary warns against racketeer
Secretary to the Cabinet of Ministers Sumith Abeysinghe said no relief has been granted for Customs duties and taxes for shipping personal goods and international parcels.
The Office of the Cabinet of Ministers recently received some information about a racketeer who makes money claiming that the government has granted relief for shipping international parcels and personal goods and he could assist with the process.
This racketeer has provided fake letters using the letterhead of the Office of the Cabinet of Ministers. The Secretary urged the public not to be misled by these fake letters.
The Officer of the Cabinet of Ministers has already informed the IGP to conduct an investigation in this regard and take legal action against the culprit.
If any person wishes to check the accuracy of a letter sent under the letterhead of the Office of Cabinet of Ministers, they can do so by calling 0112 329620 or 0112 525279 or sending an email to [emailprotected].

End to humanelephant conflict by mid-2019
The Sustainable Development, Wildlife and Regional Development Ministry is confident that by mid 2019, the long existing humanelephant conflict could be done away with.
Minister Field Marshel Sarath Fonseka said a 2,500km-long fence system will be constructed in addition to the 4,500km-long fencing existing in 16 districts where humanelephant conflict is on the increase.
In addition to the construction of new fence, special effort is being made to keep the existing fence reinforced and invulnerable to elephant attacks, with the same technology being adopted for the new fence.
A spokesperson of the Wildlife Department told the Daily News that the construction of one kilometre of protective fence costs the department Rs. 600,000 to 656,000 and the erection of the new fence of 2,500km would cost around Rs. 2 billion.
It is planned to detail a force of around 7,000 Wildlife officers and civil security guards to look after and maintain the fence system round the clock.
According to the spokesperson, instead of constructing a fence dividing the wildlife and forest reservations as at present, the fence would be erected separating both wildlife and forest reservation on one side from the human habitation and cultivation zones, on the other. It is believed that such a new approach would be more productive and efficient. In the Anuradhapura district, 39 wild elephants were killed in 2016 and 35 in 2017, whereas 12 persons and 11 persons were killed in 2016 and 2017, respectively, in the human elephant conflict.
During the nine-month period up to September 2018, 40 wild elephants and 12 persons died.

Fertilizer for farmers at old price
Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera has instructed relevant authorities to provide urea fertilizer at the old price despite a price hike in the international market.
The price of a metric ton of urea fertilizer exceeds US$ 370 (Rs. 62,803) in the global market and consequently, the price of chemical fertilizers is rising rapidly.
A meeting to discuss the measures that need to be taken to provide fertilizer subsidy without any delay or shortage for the farmers for the 2018 Maha season was held recently under the patronage of Minister Amaraweera with the participation of officials from the National Fertilizer Secretariat, Commercial Fertilizer Company and Ceylon Fertilizer Company.
During the meeting, Minister Amarawera instructed the National Fertilizer Secretariat to take necessary measures to continue the fertilizer subsidy given to farmers in Sri Lanka despite the increase in the price of urea fertilizer in the global market.
According to that, a 50kg urea fertilizer bag will be given to paddy farmers for Rs. 500 and at a price of Rs 1,500 for other crops.
The government now purchases a 50kg urea fertilizer bag for Rs. 3,500, offering it at subsidized prices of Rs. 3,000 for paddy cultivation and Rs. 2,000 for other crops.
The Minister said more paddy fields will be cultivated in the Maha season than in the Yala season and instructed officials to provide opportunity for the farmers to purchase fertiliser without any inconvenience.
Minister Amaraweera also instructed officials to implement a mechanism to maintain coordination between agrarian organisations and agrarian service centres on daily fertilizer requirements.
According to the National Fertilizer Secretariat sources, around 800,000 hectares of paddy lands will be cultivated in the Maha season this year. This would require 265,000 metric tons of urea, 65,000 metric tons Triple Super Phosphate (TSP) and 75,000 metric tons of Muriate of Potash (MOP).

Foreign policy should include environment protection - PM
The countrys foreign policy should be extended to include the protection of the environment and climate without restricting it to governance and international relations, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said during his recent four of Norway.
He had made much effort to obtain Norwegian assistance to safeguard Sri Lankas climate and environment, the Prime Minister said, adding that he hoped to discuss measures for safeguarding our maritime zone and developing oceanic resources as well with the Norwegian government in the future.
The Prime Minister was speaking at the opening of the Central Cultural Fund project office complex at National Namal Uyana in Ulpathagama, Galkiriyagama, on Saturday.
The Prime Minister who inaugurated the project office website later, went on an inspection tour of National Namal Uyana accompanied by Wanawasi Rahula Thera. He also garlanded the bust of former President J.R. Jayewardene at Namal Uyana.
The Prime Minister who said that he expected Ven. Wanawasi Rahula Thera to blame him for his failure to visit National Namal Uyana earlier, said the Ven. Thera did not do so and he wished to thank him for it.
Premier Wickremesinghe who thanked Ven. Rahula Thera for the yeoman service rendered in safeguarding Namal Uyana, said Bradman Weerakoon too was especially interested in it and lent all his support to the project with his (the Prime Ministers) knowledge. If not for Ven. Rahula Thera, someone else would have made it a money-making project and even destroyed the rose quartz deposits there.
He said Ven. Rahula Thera had succeeded in getting the patronage of all governments for the preservation of Namal Uyana. Minister Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe would look into the needs and shortcomings of the Central Cultural Fund which looked after projects of this nature.
Namal Uyana and its rose quartz deposits had good potential for the development of the tourist industry as well. The rose quartz deposits dated back to more than 550 million years. Discussions were now ongoing for the establishment of a timber museum there as requested by the Ven. Rahula Thera. Attention would also be drawn towards the installation of a cable car project too, the Premier said.

Israel to grant five-year visas for agriculture sector
Israeli has agreed to grant a five-year visa for Sri Lankan migrant workers in the agriculture sector.
Deputy Minister Manusha Nanayakkara who visited Israel on the instructions of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure, and Foreign Employment Minister Harin Fernando held bilateral discussions in this regard with the Israeli Foreign Ministry officials.
The agreement will be signed with the coordination of the International Migration Institute. Israeli officials said a considerable number of Sri Lankans out of the 500 employed in the agriculture sector in Israel have not returned upon expiry of their visas and this would cause the future job quota to be reduced. They said those who had returned upon expiry of their visas would be able to get jobs in the same sector again.
At this discussion, both parties agreed to sign agreements immediately on facilitating 500 Sri Lankans to obtain jobs in the housemaid sector in Israel.
Israeli officials were also positive about the request made by the Deputy Minister for expediting the issuance of visa for employees who have passed the interviews for employment in Israel.

Principal locks up students for fee default, parents say
A principal of an international school in Nugegoda had allegedly locked up nearly 60 students in a room in the school, due to non-payment of term fees, last Friday.
According to the police, the parents of the students had made a complaint regarding the incident to the Mirihana Police and the Police emergency number 119 and also to the Child Protection Bureau. The parents say they had agreed to bear the additional cost of 12.5 percent of the total term fees which arises every two years.
But the schools management had decided to arbitrarily and unfairly increase the term fees. Also, the increased term fees differed from other schools within this group of schools.
According to the complaint made by the parents to the Mirihana Police, the schools management had also hired a private security firm to harass and threaten the students who were unable to pay the increased amount of the term fee on time.
According to the parents, the schools management had charged an excessive amount of money during the last four to five years, while violating the terms of the agreement between the school and the parents.
The parents had complained to the schools management that they were not in a position to pay the arbitrarily increased fees. They had asked the management to give them a written explanation as to why they were charging the increased fees.
The schools management is continuously threatening the students with the help the private security firm, the parents say. Police investigations into the incident are been conducted under the supervision of the officer in charge of Mirihana Police.
