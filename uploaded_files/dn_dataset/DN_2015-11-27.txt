10 Healthy(and Tasty) : Foods to try in Colombo
This round-up is in lieu of World Diabetes Day this month. If you or any of your loved ones or friends need advice or check-ups for diabetes, you can visit the National Diabetes Centre at the Diabetes Association of Sri Lanka located at No 50, Sarana Mawatha, Rajagiriya or contact them on 0112872951.
Healthy food tends to get a bad rep for not tasting that great or just being too expensive to eat on a regular basis, but Colombo actually has quite a few places that serve up healthy food without compromising on flavour. From restaurants to home-cooks to Good Market vendors, Colombo's got a bunch of different options for those looking to make a change. (SR)
THE GOOD MARKET - Diyatha Uyana, Battaramulla (Thursdays)
Jeewa's and Kuma's Natural Foods have gained quite the following over the past year. They offer a bunch of different stuff ranging from local curries to fajitas, and their polos dishes have become legendary among regulars at The Good Market. For just Rs. 50 you can get some of the best pol roti and lunu miris anywhere in town and if you really want to test out their polos, go for their polos burger which is absolutely brilliant and an awesome alternative even for meat lovers. The best part however is that they use organic ingredients and free range chicken with minimal use of sugar, all of it at affordable prices.
Life Food (Strawberry Salad) is The Good Market Shop's resident health bar that specializes in salads and healthy beverages. Our pick from their salad range is the strawberry salad. The name actually doesn't do it justice since there's actually so much going on in this salad with strawberries, lettuce, avocado, cucumber, feta cheese and caramelized cashews, served with a subtly sweet strawberry dressing. This salad is an intriguing mix, it was fresh and sweet with the feta cheese adding a bit of saltiness and the cashews adding that needed crunch. Considering the veggies, this salad is a great source of omega-3 fatty acids and oleic acid as well as dietary fiber, vitamins B6, C, K and E.
CALORIE COUNTER - 61, Thimbirigasyaya Road, Colombo 05, 0112580980
When someone says Egg Benedict, with elements like bacon and hollandaise sauce (which is basically egg yolk and liquid butter), healthy isn't the first word that comes to mind. Calorie Counter takes an entirely different approach with their rendition of the classic breakfast dish. They've pretty much replaced all the usual elements with healthy alternatives like Smoked salmon being used instead of ham for a less fatty source of protein, Bagels swapped out for multi-seed brown bread which is a complex carbohydrate that breaks down slower in the system, a creamy avocado dressing replacing the hollandaise sauce, which still tasted great but with the added benefit of the avocado providing much healthier fats. While some may not see this as actual Eggs Benedict we like Calorie Counter's spin on the classic.
Their Strawberry, Watermelon & Blueberry Salad makes for a brilliant change up from the usual veggie salads. This one is practically a sugar free fruit salad that was still adequately sweet and extremely refreshing. We liked that they didn't mess around too much with the ingredients, really letting the freshness of those fruits come through beautifully.
Think of it as sort of a dessert salad to have as a palate cleanser after the mains. Nutritionally, this is absolutely packed with antioxidants (which help in prevention of cancer and reduce oxidative stress in diabetics) as well as vitamins.
EAT RIGHT - Delivery 0114247247
The Seafood Salad is a hefty bowl, basically a fresh cool garden salad, speckled with plenty of fishy chunks. This one comes with a mix of fish, calamari and prawns along with cucumber, carrot, onions, green and red peppers as well as a bit of chilli. The seafood in this one is a great source of both lean protein as well omega-3 fatty acids, plenty of antioxidants, potassium, fibres, vitamins A, B1-B8, K and pantothenic acid.
Eat Right's Chicken Wrap is as healthy as it gets (save for the roti carbs) - soft thin roti totally loaded with fresh bell peppers, lettuce, tomatoes, carrots, and long thin slices of lightly cooked chicken. It was quite tasty, with a welcome textural crunch but a bit mild in terms of heat so we went ahead and added some chilli sauce which really completed this dish. This one shares many ingredients with the salad so you can expect similar nutritional benefits as well.
WONDERBAR - 14, Reid Avenue, Colombo 7, 0779158442
The Basil Seed & Mango Pudding/Passion describes itself as a 'guiltless coconut dessert', and it does taste pretty guiltless. Luscious and creamy, the mango flavour is very subtle in this one. While the mango adds that sweet undertone, the oddly spicy flavour from the basil seed is what makes this unique. This is the sort of dessert that doesn't ruin your diet and makes you feel good, too. What's interesting is that basil seeds are actually a great source of essential oils, iron and vitamins A and K.
Wonderbar is pretty much the only place we know that offers cashew milk. This may not be for everyone since there is a difference in texture compared to your usual dairy milk, but it also has less than half the calories and fats of whole milk. While Wonderbar offers a bunch of flavours, we particularly liked the Strawberry Cashew Milk which tasted pretty close to a strawberry yogurt with a light and smooth texture and just a very subtle sweetness. The sweetener used is kithul pani, which is healthier than processed white sugar. It's also a better alternative for diabetes as well, because it doesn't cause blood sugar levels to spike like what would happen when you use white sugar. Needless to say, this too has to be consumed in moderation.
HEALTHY LIVING -Delivery, Pick-up location at Shrubbery Gardens, 0722 122 122
The Healthy Living Rice & Curry comes in chicken, fish or egg. We've had it time and time again and it's been consistently good. It's not like most rice packets you come across, where you get copious amounts of white rice, which is essentially the unhealthiest part about most R&Cs. Instead you'll find that Healthy Living's portion is almost equal parts brown rice to veggies with a decent portion of chicken curry made from chicken breast, which means the overall calorie count on this will be quite low. All the vegetable curries are also prepared in the healthiest possible ways with very little use of coconut milk and oil so this is a rice and curry that could be eaten on a regular basis.
It's hard enough finding a good Chicken Salad in Colombo, let alone one that you can get delivered. Right now only Healthy Living and Paan Paan offer this service but hopefully others will come on board. However, having a salad delivered can be a bit iffy since the ingredients need to be fresh, but in this case we didn't come across any issues. The salad comes with lettuce, red cabbage, grilled chicken, bread croutons, green apples and grapes as well as a salad dressing. All in all this salad has a bit of everything with the crunch of the lettuce and the cabbage, the slight sweetness from the fruits and the savouriness of the chicken.

Alliance Franaise de Kotte presents : ABU Collection of Collage
The Alliance Franaise de Kotte  Colombo presented the 'ABU Collection of Collage' by Prasad Abu Bakr at its gallery at 11, Keppetipola Mawatha, Colombo 05 (adjoining Police Park). Sponsored by Pegasus Reef Hotel, the exhibition is open to the public till Sunday November 29 from 10am to 6pm daily.
Chief Guest at the invitees-only opening on November 19 was Pegasus Reef Hotel General Manager Harsha Jayasinghe while the Guest of Honour was General Delegate of the Alliance Francaise Foundation in Sri Lanka Claude Alexandre Martinez.
In this exhibition, Abu the artist combined his two favourite techniques to compose pictures creating unusual collage compositions. An amateur photographer himself but having a long artistic career to his credit, Abu has formed a collection of artworks combining photography with painting and pasting of 'bits n pieces' of paper torn off from magazines, creating a visual impact of rare visual beauty.
His involvement with the arts began as a self-taught artist until he came under the direction of late Cora Abraham (pioneer of the present Cora Abraham Art Classes - once also known as Melbourne Art Classes) where his creative instincts were brought out and sharpened, not by rigid drawing or painting techniques but mostly through her attitude towards children and their response and attitude towards creativity in their evolving life. "It was an excellent kick-start for me at a tender age, which I cherish up to date", says Abu.
Abu has used his creative instincts to nourish other fields in the arts such as batiks, interior decorating, fashion designing, creative crafts, photography and literature. However he used his talent in painting to enhance most of the above artistic exercises he got involved in all along.
His involvement in batiks began when he started work with late Vipula Dharmawardena as an artist for wall hangings. He later joined Ena De Silva, the lady and her designer outfit responsible for creating the three gigantic Lanka Oberoi lobby pennants' hanging over head at the Atrium Lobby from the late 70s until recent times. Under her direction however Abu was trained to design for batik garments where his first ever exposure was designing for ladies wear and involving himself in fashion shows organised by one of Colombo's leading boutiques 'Mariposa'.
Abu's exposure overseas sharpened his knowledge in the creative arts and gave him the opportunity to work as an interior designer for leading hotel groups here and travel overseas as a pavilion designer at leading travel fairs where Sri Lanka was taking part promoting tourism.
The Alliance Franaise de KOTTE is fully affiliated to the Fondation Alliance Franaise in Paris and enjoys the total patronage of the Government of France and the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka.

[Appreciations]-27.11.2015
Emeritus Professor S. Mahalingam:
A colossus among academics
It was with deep sorrow that I was looking at the serene man now lying peacefully in a coffin. He was a colossus among the academics and he walked along the corridors of the sprawling Faculty of Engineering, University of Peradeniya with a characteristic and purposeful stride that inspired confidence in everybody who came across him.
Emeritus Professor S. Mahalingam passed away in Alakollai, Alaveddy, Jaffna on 3rd November 2015, at the age of 89, far away from his beloved Peradeniya and Kandy. He would have been 90 on 16 January 2016. Unfortunately it was not to be so.
A wave of spontaneous sorrow and grief swept across hundreds of engineers here and abroad for whom he was mentor, teacher and guide. Born on 16th January 1926 in Jaffna, he was the eldest in a family of eight. He later moved to Malaya along with his family and had his primary and secondary education at Maxwell School and Victoria College in Kuala Lumpur. Selvadurai Mahalingam left Malaya in 1946 to follow a degree course in engineering at the then Ceylon Technical College in Colombo. Ironically, according to him, Ceylonese parents in Malaya at that time wanted their children to be educated in Ceylon as there were better educational facilities and colleges teaching professional courses. Now the reverse is taking place!
Contrary to popular belief, he qualified as a Civil Engineer in 1950, having obtained a B.Sc. Eng. First class honours degree from the University of London as an external candidate. He was placed first among the candidates from Ceylon. He joined the newly established Faculty of Engineering, University of Ceylon, in 1952, as an Assistant Lecturer. It was the late Professor E. O. E. Pereira who was then the Dean, who persuaded him to switch over to Mechanical Engineering. Consequently, he proceeded to University of Sheffield for his Ph.D and completed it in 1956, specialising in torsional vibration.
He returned to the University of Ceylon in the same year and was promoted to a Lecturers' position. He published extensively, in reputed refereed journals, on topics related to his field of expertise. In recognition of his contribution, he was awarded the Doctor of Science in Engineering (DSc Eng) by the University of London. He was the first Sri Lankan Engineer to get this prestigious award. Dr. Mahalingam became the Professor of Mechanical Engineering in 1970 and retired in 1991. Grateful students organized a felicitation ceremony, the first of its kind in the history of the Engineering Faculty, to a packed house at the E.O.E. Pereira theatre.
One incident that still lingers in the minds of the Engineers, who were present that day, was how the late Dr. B M A Balasuriya, after making his speech, said that he wanted to show his respect to his teacher and went on his knees before Professor Mahalingam, touched his feet and worshiped him. It was an unforgettable moment and practically everybody present was in tears. Needless to say, the others also followed suit.
Simply dressed but elegant, his attire never changed its design, cottons being his favorite, the short sleeve shirt always over the trouser. His relatives had made sure to keep to this tradition even in his death, and not the usually seen lounge suit under similar situations.
Professor Mahalingam married Devaki who predeceased him in 2014. She was a tower of strength to him and we could see how he was devastated after her death. An embodiment of simplicity and purpose, he was a man with a mission. Students welfare and teaching were more important to him than personal benefits and comforts. Material benefits were not a priority for him. He was a highly recognized academic with an international reputation, but greener pastures were not on his agenda, although there were several overtures.
During the disastrous 1983 riots, his wife and he were compelled to move next door, to the Hilda Obeysekera Hall, for security. This was an unforgettable but very sad situation for them. When I rushed there, with my wife, to look into their welfare, he narrated the sorry state of affairs at the Hilda Obeysekera Hall and how he had to join a queue with others to use the wash room and toilets which brought tears to our eyes. But still, the greener pastures were not for him. Many are unaware how grateful we should be to have had him amidst us through all these upheavals.
When the country was experiencing the pangs of a closed economy, in the sixties and early seventies, where everything was in short supply, Professor Mahalingam embarked on a unique journey. That was to develop the Applied Mechanics Laboratory from scratch, which is a standing monument to his commitment. Now, named after him, it stands as a showpiece that attracts large crowds on every public occasion. The very unpretentious person he was, when the senior Engineers requested the Dean to name the laboratory after him, on the day of the felicitation ceremony, he flatly refused and said such things should not be done when the person was still serving in an institution. Such were his principles and discipline that he practiced by word and deed.
Although he looked very stern and hard, those who were close to him knew how compassionate and witty he was. I think the exterior was due to the self-discipline he maintained. Many a time he confessed that he could not understand why students did not come to him and asked for advise regarding the subject matter. As he was a strict disciplinarian, and especially on course work, deadlines were kept without extensions, and students feared and respected his instructions.
Despite this, Professor Mahalingam was a jovial person full of humor amongst friends. He was full of anecdotes and jokes, and had the ability to relate even the simplest, much heard of, stories with a unique style of delivery and well timed punchline to raise laughter. He also had the ability to narrate even the jokes bordering on adult content with a dead pan face.
I particularly remember an incident, in my final year, at the drawing office. I felt somebody standing behind me. When I looked up it was Professor Mahalingam and I was so nervous I just stopped whatever I was doing. He, with his characteristic delivery, said Its good to read outside the subject. Professor Tuplin is a friend of mine. His views are well known but not shared by many. He then walked away abruptly and I was stunned. He, of course, was referring to a coursework I had submitted on Holzer analysis of torsional vibration. Professor Tuplin, also, was an expert on vibration but did not favour Holzers analysis, and I also criticized and mentioned this in my discussion in the coursework. It so happened that I had read about this in a book in the library. Naturally, I expected the worst and a request for a resubmission but, he had written good to my utter surprise.
Of course, at that time I did not know that Professor Mahalingam was closely associated with Holzer analysis and in fact had modified the prevailing theory. Professor S. Mahalingams name is quoted in the well known text book, Mechanics of Vibration by Professors R. E. D. Bishop and R. C. Johnson, in recognition of his modification to the Holzer analysis. Incidentally, both of these were friends of the Professor and he co-authored several papers on vibrations with Professor R. E. D. Bishop.
Professor Mahalingam shunned publicity, did not accept positions, accolades or titles for which he maintained he was not qualified. When the University of Peradeniya offered to confer D.Sc. (Honoris Causa), he politely refused and said he had one earned doctorate and that was enough. He was very good at motivating people. Long before I read Schumachers In Search of Excellence, it was Professor Mahalingam who taught me the importance of appreciating the work of subordinates whatever the rank may be. When we were fabricating equipment for demonstration as well as for qualitative analysis, once the product was completed, he used to make a bee line to the work shop and bring the technicians who assisted in fabricating, and demonstrated the device to them first. The staff highly appreciated this indeed and went out of their way to finish work assigned to them and their unstinting cooperation was always readily available.
Many myths are generally woven around great men, these may be an indication of their greatness. Isaac Newton and Einstein had theories attributed to them which had very little to do with them. Professor Mahalingam was not an exception. There were many stories about how he had solved vibration problems in Rolls Royce gas turbines.
One such story being circulated even now, after his death, is how he had detected a defect in an Avro jet engine, and in lieu of compensation that he refused, Rolls Royce gifted a sectioned jet engine! I asked him about this, several years ago, and he laughed it off in his typical unassuming manner. He said, he just wrote to Rolls Royce explaining what he was doing at the Applied Mechanics laboratory and asked whether they had any discarded engines or equipment which could be used for teaching purposes.
They responded by saying there was a sectioned jet engine, used for a training programme, which has no use for them now and they would be pleased to donate it to the Faculty provided the freight was arranged. University had agreed to bear the cost of freight, and this engine now proudly adorns the lobby of the Faculty of Engineering, Peradeniya. A fitting display for an Engineering Faculty!
Professor Mahalingam firmly believed in a knowledge-based education with emphasis on practical application. This was the reason why he created this unique space, now known as Professor Mahalingam Laboratory, at the Faculty of Engineering, Peradeniya. This laboratory, then known as the Applied Mechanics Laboratory, is the main attraction to visitors to the Faculty, be it local or foreign. Perhaps, this home-made laboratory is the only kind in the world. Created with minimal cost, it is a veritable resource centre for all mechanical engineering students. It guides you through displays of sectioned engines to industrial applications of mechanical engineering with meticulously designed and fabricated products with superior finishes that conceal the scrap material used in them. It also demonstrates what can be achieved, with available resources, rather than waiting for foreign funds and advice.
Applied Mechanics laboratory, at first, was housed within the Applied Thermodynamics Laboratory. Very soon it became evident that the space was running out as new equipment and display units were being turned out almost every other week. If I remember right, it was in 1970 the need for a new building was conceptualized and Professor Mahalingam agreed to try out Dr. Milton Amaratunges suggestion to use no fine concrete for the non-load bearing walls to keep the cost down. However, he ran out of the meager funds provided by the university. Under similar situations the others normally give up but his determination was such that he used petty cash in the department, to complete the building.
He was a witty person too. Once in our final year, just outside the lecture room, somebody raised the engine of his two-stroke motor cycle, sans the silencer. With his characteristic staccato voice, he asked,Who made that spectacular display of his horsepower He was not without critics. There were many who found fault with him for not initiating post-graduate studies in his field of specialization. His answer to that was, he did not believe in half-baked products. He bemoaned the fact that the University did not have sufficient funds to get down text books and journals of repute. How can I produce post-graduates under such circumstances, he asked, quite rightly, too.
He was the last of the pioneering academics that launched the first Faculty of Engineering in Sri Lanka. Professor Mahalingam was a teacher and a gentleman par excellence worthy of emulation.

Jayathunga Amaraweera:
The librarian who never became old with thoughts
Jayathunga Amaraweera who served in the library profession for over 37 years passed away on 27 October 2015. He was a rare person who grasped the new developments in technology and adopted the changes rapidly to serve his clients. Therefore, he was very popular among his clients and colleagues. At a time when the readers are moving from libraries to computers to find information, he played the role of a cybrarian very effectively. During the last several months there wasnt a single day without his mails in our e-mail inbox on various matters related to IT and Library & Information Science.
Jayathunga Amaraweera was born on 15 July 1944 at Pannipitiya in Colombo District. He had his education in Terrance de Silva Junior School, Kolonnawa, Thurstan College, Colombo and University of Sri Jayawardenapura, then known as Vidyodaya University. He obtained his honours degree in Science in 1966.
After graduation he served as a teacher at Mirigama Maha Vidyalaya from 1967 to 1970. He met his life partner Korala Gamage Nandawathie Samanlatha at Mirigama and got married to her in 1969. The efforts of Amaraweera couple to provide a higher education to their children were fruitful, since they are employed in high positions and engaged in high social mission.
After serving two more years as a teacher at Ananda Sastralaya, Kotte, Jayathunga Amaraweera joined the Sri Lanka Rubber Research Institute (RRI) as the Librarian & the Publications Officer in 1972. His dedicated service to RRI and the research libraries in Sri Lanka is unique. He was an active member of the Agrinet Library Network in Sri Lanka. I had the opportunity to meet him at the Agrinet meetings and built up a good friendship with him since I worked at the Coconut Research Institute Library. Although both of us changed working places we continued to be in the library profession. Therefore our friendship continued until his sudden demise.
Jayathunga Amaraweera obtained his masters degree in Library and Information Science from the University of Kelaniya. He published the outcome of his research in many local and foreign journals and they were well recognized throughout the world. After leaving RRI in 1978 he served as the Chief Librarian of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation for a period of one year.
He joined the University of Sri Jayawardenapura as the Senior Assistant Librarian in 1979. He was appointed as the first Librarian of the Buddhist and Pali University in 1998. He served there until his retirement in 2009. After establishing the Buddhist and Pali University Library Jayathunga Amaraweera successfully completed the automation of this library.
He served in the panel of lecturers in the University of Kelaniya, Sri Lanka Library Association, National Institute of Library and Information Science at the University of Colombo and National Institute of Education. He made an excellent contribution through his knowledge and experience to students of library and information science in those institutions. Jayathunga Amaraweera was an active member of the Sri Lanka Library Association and the University Librarians Association for several decades. He held key positions in these associations and contributed immensely to the library profession.
Jayathunga Amaraweeras dedicated services to improve the library field in Sri Lanka with the assistance from Dr. M P Satija, a reputed library science expert and UGC Emeritus fellow, Dept of Library & Information Science, Guru Nanak Dev University, Amritsar, India, is commendable.
His dedicated service for the library field, developing international co-ordination with India, Maldives and Western countries must be highly appreciated. His high qualities of leadership are admired by his colleagues and students. Although Amaraweera left us suddenly from a suspected stroke, he will remain in the hearts of all his friends and relations because of his great humane qualities. The large numbers of relations, colleagues and friends gathered for his funeral and the condolence notices that appeared on Facebook and through e-mail are evidence for this.
May he attain supreme bliss of Nibbana!

The 28th Professor K. N. Seneviratne : Memorial Oration
Professor Carlo Fonseka
On August 10, 1986 Professor Kirthi Nissanka Seneviratne, aged 56, was in Bali Indonesia listening to Johann Sebastian Bach when a massive heart attack felled him  this giant of a man and jewel of a human being. Ever since that day I have never ceased to curse the avaricious tobacco industry for this pre-meditated act of homicide.
By common consent Professor KNS was the most distinguished Physiologist the Colombo Medical School has produced upto date. By the munificence of his accomplished Scottish wife Alison Alexandar, a Master of Arts of the University of Edinburgh from which KNS himself earned his PhD in the early 1960s, an oration to commemorate him annually was inaugurated in 1987.
The inaugural oration was delivered by his PhD Supervisor, Professor David Witteridge, FRS, who happened to be the last direct pupil of Nobel laureate Sir Charles Sherrington, OM, President of the Royal Society. Taking as he did is intellectual descent from the last pupil of the great Sir Charles Sherrinton himself, the academic pedigree of KNS was impeccable.
Family Pedigree
So was his family pedigree, KNS was the second of the three children of Dr. Robert and Laura Seneviratne. In 1887 Dr. Robert Seneviratne qualified as a doctor in the Ceylon Medical College and then proceeded to Edinburgh Scotland for further study. The eldest in the family - Irangani, married Engineer Athukorale and after living many years in Sri Lanka emigrated with her family to Australia. The youngest in the family, amiable Nihal, an LLB of the University of Ceylon is with us here and now and has generously carried the organisational burden of conducting every single Professor K. N. Seneviratne memorial oration from it very inception.
In the mercenary era in which we live, when even brothers and sisters are prone to compete ruthlessly with one other for wealth and prestige, Irangani, Nissanka and Nihal have been exemplary siblings. The family is distinguished socially. I will never forget what KNS - who had delightful humour, once quipped when someone, half in envy, commented on the social distinction of their family: Yes, but my brother is only a Clerk he said. That was true. At that time Nihal Seneviratne was the Clerk of the House of Representatives, a position he adorned for several decades. He has proved to be the keeper of his brother's name and reputation.

Art by Kekuli
Art by Kekuli, is the brainchild of the artist's current state of mind.
Just as a child develops and grows - mentally, physically and emotionally over the course of life, one's state of mind too develops and continues to grow over time. We are to a great extent the result of the sum of the collective experiences we have encountered throughout the journey of life and "Life" as we all know it, is ambiguous.
We are constantly presented with new experiences; some joyous and some sorrowful. However, what we need to know & understand is that we cannot pick and choose our experiences or potential experiences or the lack of certainly preferred experiences thereof. This is the hard truth.
On a more positive note however, I think it is equally important if not even more critical to stay focused throughout our trying times. We need to take responsibility and we owe it to ourselves and our loved ones. After all we also need to appreciate, enjoy and experience some of the beautiful destinations we discover and travel through.
This is exactly what Kekuli Unamboowe Abeyratne's inaugural exhibition themed "A Tumultuous journey to a tranquil state of mind" is about. The exhibition will be inaugurated on December 2 at 4pm the Lionel Wendt Art Centre, Guildford Crescent, Colombo 7 and will be open to the public from 6pm-8pm and from 8.30am to 8pm on December 3.
It signifies two very important elements. The first being the journey itself: beginning of a distressed journey that ends well with a tranquil and calm state of mind and the Second being the end result of being tranquil itself. It's all about taking your negative experiences and energy and turning them into something beautiful and positive.
In her context the tumultuous journey signifies her state of mind after the passing of her loving husband, Late Victor Kapil Abeyratne. She was filled with grief, sorrow, pain and much more emotions that she has never experienced before not coping very well. It was then that her two daughters encouraged her to start painting. They were aware that she loved to sketch and draw. This was of course not a habit but it was random and she used to sketch if and when she was bored. The daughters reminded her how beautiful her work look and convinced that painting itself is a very good coping mechanism and therapeutic.
Now that she is aware of it, she can vouch that painting is a form of expressive therapy, like meditation and it definitely uses one's creative process of painting to improve one's physical, mental and emotional wellbeing, as it did hers. Gradually she became more involved and focused on her paintings, consuming most of her time which she enjoyed.
She began buying more art supplies, reading books, trying different methods and she was living the life of an artist. She felt calm, emotionally balanced and above all focused. What fascinated her most was the hidden talent that she has been having for decades which she was not fully aware of. Slowly her family and friends after viewing her work encouraged and motivated her to have an exhibition.
Her goal was not to create a masterpiece/s or to have an exhibition but as it turned out she had enough paintings which she was told are very beautiful to display.
She believes Art to be her creative outlet as well as an outlet to de-stress. This is fantastic for her because she is very passionate about it and it kills two birds with one stone.
When people ask her from who she think she has inherited the talent from, she says she think it is from her father. Late Terrence Unamboowe although a lawyer and High Court Judge, was multi talented and loved the artistic sphere. He was a Poet, an Author, Songwriter and Singer. So she guesses it has to be from him without a doubt.

Austerity cuts challenge European Police facing terror threat
UK: Europe is facing the spectre of attacks by ISIS jihadists with police numbers in some countries hit by austerity cuts, raising questions about whether this is making it easier for assailants to slip through the net.
Following this month's Paris attacks in which 130 people died, other EU nations are on high alert.
But the tragedy has also fuelled debate about whether, in the rush to shrink deficits bloated by the 2008 financial crisis, some nations are laying off too many officers and lowering their guard.
A string of extra jobs and funding in counter-terrorism and intelligence have been announced across Europe since the November 13 tragedy in France's capital.
"In reaction to Paris, you'll probably see more and more will be put into security services and there will be a reversal of the trends," said Professor Christian Kaunert of Dundee University, director of the European Institute for Security and Justice.
"There's a massive realisation that has hit politicians because of the threat they are confronting with Daesh," he added, using a different acronym for ISIS.
But many of the questions come around frontline policing rather than specific counter-terrorism units. Officers say that fewer eyes and ears on the ground means they risk missing vital information.
"It will make Britain more vulnerable to terrorism," Robert Quick, Scotland Yard's former head of counter-terrorism, told Britain's Guardian newspaper of police cuts expected in Britain's budget update on Wednesday.
"It will lead to a loss of intelligence, a loss of confidence and trust."
In France, which currently has nearly 250,000 police and gendarmes, 13,000 were cut under the previous government between 2007 and 2012.
President Francois Hollande has since announced thousands of new security jobs, including 5,000 new police and gendarmes following the Paris attacks.
In Belgium, where the capital Brussels is on the highest security threat level as police hunt Belgian-born Paris suspect Salah Abdeslam, the government dropped plans to make a four percent saving on numbers after a jihadist cell was broken up in January.
Police in the Brussels suburb of Molenbeek, seen as a breeding ground for Islamist extremism and once home to Abdeslam, say they are short of 125 officers.
"In terms of radicalism, local police are responsible for gathering information on the ground since we are best placed for that," Johan De Becker, chief of the Brussels West police zone, told RTBF television last week.
In England and Wales, where community policing initiatives were built up after the July 7, 2005 bombings in London, the number of police has fallen nearly 12 percent since 2010.
As well as frontline cuts, finance minister George Osborne is to announce Wednesday that counter-terrorism funding is rising by 30 percent.
Prime Minister David Cameron also confirmed Monday that an extra 1,900 security and intelligence staff were being recruited.
There have also been policing cuts in countries like Italy and Spain, where 191 people were killed in the Madrid train bombings in 2004.
No one disputes that trying to prevent major attacks is a costly business. Jon Moran of Leicester University, a specialist in security studies, said surveillance which can be used to track Islamists suspected of plotting attacks is "the most expensive tactic used by the police". "Cuts to the police and security services in France and Belgium and the Netherlands may have had an effect on the ability of these services to conduct surveillance on the range of individuals and groups they have identified as targets," he added. - AFP

CFW empowers emerging fashion talent
Following three successful seasons this year, Colombo Fashion Week now focuses on prepping Sri Lanka's emerging fashion talent to reach great heights. At two recently held workshops 'Making the Cut' and 'CFW Day' at Raffles Design Institute, fashion students and aspiring fashion designers were able to engage with the CFW team as well as established designers who were able to launch and grow their fashion labels through their participation at CFW.
Making the Cut, held on November 9 at the Hilton Colombo, was a free workshop exclusively for emerging designers who wish to apply to CFW's Emerging Designer Showcase, BrightSpark Shows. Held twice a year, the Emerging Designer Showcase has become an important milestone in the careers of Sri Lanka's most talented young designers, who see it as a valuable platform in which they are able to take their labels off the ground and be noticed by the media and discerning consumers. The workshop saw a packed room filled with eager, young designers who will apply this month to grab ten coveted spots at the CFW Spring/Summer 2016 Show.
Participants at Making the Cut
Founder and President of CFW Ajai V. Singh in his presentation at the workshop, explained the careful process in which applicants are handpicked for the Emerging Designer Showcase, stressing on the importance of having passion to grow within the industry. Enlightening attendees on the benefits of showing at CFW, Singh also took attendees through the essential components that make a runway- and retail-ready collection and, most importantly, all that is required to stand out in their applications to showcase. The workshop was an opportunity for young designers to directly engage with the CFW team and gain first-hand knowledge of debuting at an international fashion week and preparing for the response that often follows, and other aspects of the industry that are not generally taught at fashion schools.
Throughout the year, CFW holds CFW Day at leading fashion design schools in the country to introduce fashion students to CFW, educate them on the possibilities within the Sri Lankan fashion industry and help them identify the ways in which they can prepare to showcase at CFW and grow their labels. On November 11, a 'CFW Day' was held at Raffles Design Institute, Colombo.
To speak on their personal journeys were Charini Suriyage, one of Sri Lanka's most prolific designers who has shown at many CFW seasons, and Kasun Gunawardana, who debuted at CFW and won the prestigious CFW Fashion Design Fund, this year. Suriyage was an intern at the first-ever Colombo Fashion Week back in 2003 and went on to launch her label CHARINI at CFW in 2009. Since then, she has grown from strength to strength, with CFW serving as the key platform for her to learn, and develop and market her brand.
"As a designer, it is very important to have your own identity, and CFW helped me find my identity. Today, my label has evolved and I have my own workshop and staff," she said. "CFW brings exposure to designers amongst influential invitees, and this in turn inspires others to buy and wear your label too." Drawing from the response he received following his showcases at Spring/Summer and Resort, Gunwardana said, "CFW gives its designers the opportunity to gain much coverage in mainstream media. There is also a lot of publicity given on social media, which has opened up ways in which those who do not attend the shows can engage in and experience what is shown on the runway."
"It is a wonderful opportunity presented to our student body and graduates, as they gain first-hand information on collection development and the market for fashion today", Raffles Design Institute Student Coordinator of Fashion Design Dinesh Chandrasena said.

Champs Kandy SC prove their worth
Reigning champions Kandy SC won the opening game against one- time kings of club rugby CH and FC at Nittawela on Sunday evening by a mammoth score. The winners wrapped up the game, they way it should be as a champion for another year, they also looked the better side in play, the opponents failed to finish the game. The home outfit managed to limit their guests to just one penalty that came in the fourth minute of play, which was goaled by Janith Chandimal
Putting hands together on the ball was a clear tactic by Kandy SC, it wasn't just one player, it was all getting involved - or just one type of ball handling, and also there were grubbers, chips, they looked to test CH and FC under high ball and turn them in defence , which reaped good rewards .
CH and FC never looked like scoring a try but, more significantly, Kandy SC never looked like leaking one. Their defence was solid throughout as they missed five tackles while the CH and FC missed 22. Even when Kandy SC went to their go-to weapon of a driving maul game they never looked tired, their defence was solid throughout. Kandy SC started with their good moves, with scrum half Roshan and fly half Fazil kept on feeding good ball to the backs with no end to all opening. Kandy's game plan, based on tough defence and good ball handling at every opportunity, frustrated CH and FC. This game which stayed as one sided until the final whistle and the winners have reason to be proud. Nineteen tries were scored in total, out of which five were goaled.
Kandy SC did well to survive a battering up front in the game, and there were positives in the performances of the back three and both centers. Fazil Marija in particular, you would think, with his versatility has played himself as a match winning captain.
Going into the game knowing they needed to win by a clean margin with bonus points Marija's team produced an incredible show of attacking rugby which saw them as one of the most remarkable, and unbowed side. CH and FC were noticeably rattled in this game, but their power told in their game, a big hand should go to the young men who gave a good game of rugby and kept the club flag flying.

Dare Devils of Galle Fort

Forts equivalent to Bungee jumping
Galle Fort jumping off the ancient citadel walls started in the early 90s and it is the world's equivalent to the bungee jump only a lot more dangerous, because the guys don't even use an elasticised rope to pull you back from the near death experience, or a totally clear landing point. This hair rising jump off the walls is based on the Fort Ramparts at the top of the wall known as Flag Rock between Point Utrecht Bastion and Triton Bastion.
For those that like to dice with mortality and experience Fort life on the edge nothing beats watching these lads spring into action; Chamara, Lasantha, Chinthaka, Rawan and Ranga each one has their own technique when it comes to diving over the wall whether it's a long run off akin to batman taking his car out of the bat cave or a short position your hand correctly and jump.
Watching it every day it is amazing that even on a windy or stormy afternoon each diver always miraculously misses the deadly rocks below and are diving into a only a few feet of water, three to four feet only in places. A few foreigners have tried and not surprisingly in most cases have ended up very badly hurt and this includes a Japanese guy that broke both his legs and an Italian tourist who landed head first on the rocks and smashed his face and arms to pieces. So the lads would not under any circumstances recommend in a moment of bravado you try out 'The Jump'. Just merely pay the local lads something to demonstrate how it's done and they will happily show you a whole range of dives, something even the army stationed only a few minutes further along the walls would envy the ability to do.
Smiling and Clapping
Free faller
Chamara Sampath, one of the jumpers has been free style diving off the Fort walls for nearly a decade and he says with a huge smile on his face "I love to jump every day of the week and about five to ten times a day. For one jump I was once paid an incredible 10,000 rupees and yet the greatest pleasure I get is from showing the small school children how to do it. Seeing the kids smiling and clapping their hands in joy is payment enough for me." Chamara has been offered well-paid jobs in the army to train Sri Lankan soldiers in the art of free style diving and has had numerous opportunities in TV commercials, and even a recent cooking show with the owner of Flying Fish Peter Kurivita, who highlighted them in his Sri Lankan food show as part of his amazing series My Sri Lanka. Peter wisely did not have a go at the jump!
Chamara says he could have joined the army in the war or got a job in Colombo like many of his friends but did not want to be away from his family. Chamara says, "If I could have my life over again I would have only two wishes and that is to teach this in every school round the country and lobby for this to be national sport like cricket." He is still amazed by how many people say anyone can do it, but explains, "It's not just the height that is dangerous, but the ever changing weather conditions and level of the sea water from three to five feet, which we assess each and every time we do a dive."
Splash
Each lad has an amusing story to tell however when it comes to the tsunami there is a deep sadness in their eyes as they recall Boxing Day morning on December 26, 2004. Chamara says, "It was busy on the Fort Ramparts with lot of tourists as we were in a period of ceasefire, like any other peak tourism season day we were busy talking to people about what we do. A local group pulled up in a van and asked Chamara to jump and after negotiating a price Chamara says, "I started to run as the water rose up to meet me at the top of the wall. It was so high that even a small child could have done the dive that morning. It meant for the first time ever I didn't need to climb back up the rock face, and within seconds of being back on my jumping spot I was even more alarmed to see the seawater recede and vanish. It was just like the plug had been pulled out of the Indian Ocean. I could see everything on the sea bed and was amazed that places like elephant rock had rocks underneath it in the form of legs just like the animal its named after and everywhere I could see beautiful multi-coloured corals, fish gasping for breath and bits of old boats. I knew then something was terribly wrong as I had never seen seawater vanish before and ran as fast I could straight home to check on my mum and sisters."
James Bond style stunts
Despite some very extreme and daunting moments over the years the jumpers as they liked to be called say it is a great way to stay fit and earn a decent living, which in no easy thing coming from a village background. So if you want to capture the guys in action take a good camera, listen to their advice on the best places to see these jumpers perform James Bond style stunts, so you can capture a moment you will remember for the rest of your lives. The best point to take pictures is not necessarily on Flag Rock itself, where a green hand painted sign with an arrow pointing to the edge says 'Jump' and we suggest you don't under any circumstances. The best photographic view is back down the steps and a little way along the ramparts slightly to the right of the rock to get both the jumpers and the Bastian in shot.
The local lads will happily wait for you to get in position and then kick off their flip flops unless they are already barefoot and nicely ask the crowd to clear a path for them to run from one end of Flag Rock to the other. The distance and speed is vital to give themselves enough levitation to dive clear of both the wall and rocks. Most of these jumpers as they like to be known collectively have been doing this since they were teenagers and even with daily practice have only seen one foreigner a Californian guy clear the rocks safely.
Rawan the first guy to ever do the jump says "even with years of experience of doing the same jump over and over again the is still an element of risk with freak winds pushing you back against the rock, and that's what makes it such an adrenaline junkie sport."
Jumper climbing up walls
The best time to go and see these amazing divers is in the late afternoon as it is fantastic for both light and to get a clear shot of the jumpers entering the water either individually or in a group. You will always find one or several of the lads hanging out at Flag Rock in the old fort on Lighthouse Street, where there is little food stalls including mango smothered in chilli and short eats in the evening so you can have a snack after this death defying experience. The jumpers are usually around between 9am up until 6pm.

Darkest day in the city of lights
A man without ethics is a wild beast loosed upon this world  Albert Camus
Following the Charlie Hebdo in January killing 17 people, it was the second terror attack for this year in Paris. This time losing 129 innocent civilians on the evening of November 13. This was a carefully planned and coordinated multiple attack on six different locations by eight gunmen. Out of the eight killers, seven committed suicide. The worst attack taking most lives was at a live concert at Bataclan Theatre killing more than 80. It was a painful day which will be remembered by the entire world  a particular hit to human values. ISIS who claim responsibility have declared a war beyond their geographical area to the entire world.
Few weeks ago, the Russian flight carrying passengers from Shyam el Shek were bombed according to the western intelligence agency reports. On Thursday another suicide attack in Beirut killed 40 innocent civilians. These cowardly acts by the ISIS militant group is a clear message sent to the western world. One may wonder if the clash of the civilizations from Samuel P. Huntington is unfolding between the West and ISIS. We live at a point in history that we have witnessed serious height of terrorism from 9/11 to Mumbai attack and to many other attacks in our own nation Sri Lanka.
Extremist ideologies
According to the French philosopher Andr Glucksmann who passed away last week clearly states the characteristic form of modern terrorism is nihilism. What do extremist ideologies like the communism or Nazism of yesteryear and the Islamism of today have in common After all, they support ostensibly very different ideals  the superior race, mankind united in socialism, the community of Muslim believers (the Umma). Tomorrow, it could be altogether different ideals: some theological, some scientific, others racist. But the common characteristic is nihilism. Whatever the cause, ISIS killing innocent people is most certainly not Islam.
World leaders meeting at the G20 conference in Antalya could be an opportunity to retool the strategy against ISIS. With coordinated effort from the global powers ISIS could be defeated. There should be space given to any nation who is ready to support and fight ISIS. Eastern powers; particularly Chinese and Indian among other nations should support this cause. There is no time to waste on political games as the threat from ISIS is serious and daily spreading. A political and military solution to ISIS terror should be ranked top priority on the global agenda.
The ISIS usage of social media for propaganda and the radicalization programme using new methods is more evident than any other terrorist group in history. It appears ISIS is hiding operatives among the tide of legitimate refugees now entering Europe as one gunman was identified as a refugee who entered using this path.
Multiple threat groups in Asia
You could hear of the large number of US and Europeans who are receiving training, motivation and skills in Syria to perpetrate attacks in the western soil. Multiple threat groups in Asia have either pledged support to IS or taken an oath of allegiance to Abu Bakr al Baghdadi. In Asia, two dozen groups support IS. Over 1000 recruits from Central Asia, South Asia, Southeast Asia, China, Australia and New Zealand have travelled to Syria and Iraq.

There are few important areas that the security agencies can work on. Several months ago on Counter-radicalism policies and strategies: lessons learned and future steps at the annual Strategic Studies Summit held in Antalya I mentioned clearly the importance of focusing on de-radicalization and counter-radicalization programmes. Those subject to radicalization should engage in rehabilitation programmes with the assistance from the civil society.
The role of civil society in counter-radicalization and de-radicalization is essential. Civil society and Governments can work in partnership to prevent radicalization by tackling economic, social and political drivers. When Governments set policy framework, providing funding, and addressing structural issues. However, communities also need to play their part for the overall approach to be successful. Civil society has a role to play to counter messages of radicalization and often it will be more effective when they come from communities rather than governments.
Intelligence services
Another focus area is the enhancement of intelligence apparatus as Paris and few other attacks demonstrated a failure in the intelligence services by the state. A nation like Sri Lanka that battled terrorism for nearly three decades could provide expertise to fight terrorism. Our military and intelligence services have shown that any terrorist outfit could be destroyed with the right strategy and skill. All nations including Sri Lanka should invest in national security, an important area underinvested by many nations especially on strategic defence studies.
As President Obama rightly said at the G20 meeting The killing of innocent people based on a twisted ideology is an attack not just on France, not just on Turkey, it is an attack on the civilized world,. The world needs secure order and we should not underestimate the threat from the terrorist and invest for a better intelligence to fight global terrorism. Today a nation is mourning and the world remains in shock at the brutality of the disgraceful act which could be entering another nation tomorrow.
At the darkest moment in the city of lights, together we all should stand to defeat terrorism.

Day-night Test: Smith & McCullum excited at 'creating history'
Cricket's first day-night Test using a pink ball is an "exciting concept", says Australia captain Steve Smith.

Australia and New Zealand play under floodlights at the Adelaide Oval in a bid to boost attendances.

"I can't wait to get out and give it a crack," said 26-year-old Smith. "We are creating history."

New Zealand captain Brendon McCullum echoed Smith's enthusiasm as he said day-night Tests could be "outstanding for the game moving forward".
The match will be the third and final Test of the series between the two countries, with Australia leading 1-0.

"I'm sure a lot of people are going to be watching around the world and I think that is really exciting for world cricket," added Smith.

"The crowds have rolled in. The first two Tests were a little bit disappointing with the crowds but there are some big numbers expected for at least the first three days here."
How different is a day/night Test

A pink ball, which has been designed to be visible in natural light and under floodlights, will be used but all other playing conditions remain unaltered for the match.

"I think people are voting with their feet," said McCullum, with a crowd of 50,000 expected for the first day.

"They are encouraged by what the pink ball test match has to offer.

"And for us to play in front of 40,000-odd people in a Test match is pretty amazing, so we're really, really excited about it.

"Hopefully it goes off brilliantly and there's no challenges, no problems.

"If we have that final session on the fifth day under lights, and a Test match result is in the balance, then I think that it could be anything for Test cricket."

'I know it will be under the microscope'

John Stephenson, head of cricket at the Marylebone Cricket Club, which is the guardian of the laws of the game, hopes the day-night format can expand to other countries on the back of this match.

"My hope is first and foremost that more people come to watch. I don't think it should be judged solely on this Test match," he said.

"What I'd like to see is other Test nations look to embrace it.

"I don't think broadcasters really want Test cricket played to empty stadia."
The opening day of the Test will mark a year to the day that Australia batsman Phillip Hughes passed away after being struck by a bouncer during a domestic match.

A tribute to Hughes will be played on the big screen during the first break at the Adelaide Oval.

"A year on we still have Hughesie in the back of our minds every time we walk out on to the field," said Smith.

"It's a tough time for his family and friends and we respect that. Hopefully, we can have a good week for Phillip." (BBC Sports)

Facts take a back seat in White House race
US: It is campaign season, and facts are taking it on the chin.
Republican Donald Trump's claim that Arab Americans cheered during the September 11, 2001 attacks is just the latest in a string of falsehoods from US presidential candidates.
Trump is not alone among the candidates in distorting the truth, according to fact-checkers.
Carly Fiorina falsely claimed the United States was preparing to accept 250,000 Syrian refugees; Marco Rubio said that welders earn more than philosophers; and Ben Carson stated that no signatories of the Declaration of Independence had elected office experience.
Democrats have stretched the truth as well -- Hillary Clinton by claiming that her handling of emails through a private server was "permitted" by the State Department. Bernie Sanders overstated the evidence by asserting that "climate change is directly related to the growth of terrorism."
Such claims, which have been debunked by fact checkers, are part of political life.
But the 2016 Republican campaign has been notable for incendiary claims, most notably by Trump.
"There is no rigorous way to quantify deception being better or worse over time," said Brendan Nyhan, a Dartmouth College political scientist who follows fact-checking and campaigns.
"But I do think it's fair to say Donald Trump is on the verge of melting down the fact-checking sites with what he is saying."
Trump earlier this year said the US unemployment rate was as high as 42 percent. More recently, he tweeted a graphic showing that 81 percent of white homicide victims were killed by blacks. The website PolitiFact said the correct figure from Department of Justice statistics was 15 percent.
Asked by Fox News about the mistake, Trump said, "I didn't tweet, I retweeted somebody that was supposedly an expert... am I gonna check every statistic"
The New York Times said in an editorial Tuesday that the past week of the campaign had been "dominated by Donald Trump's racist lies."
Politicians in many cases have stood by their claims -- including Trump arguing that he saw thousands cheering the 9/11 attacks -- after being confronted with facts.
Trump even fired back at the Washington Post which debunked his 9/11 claims, tweeting "I want an apology! Many people have tweeted that I am right!"
The stubbornness surprises even the fact-checkers.
"There have definitely been times when I scratch my head wondering how could they say something when it is so obviously false and then not acknowledge that it is false," said Bill Adair, a founder and contributing editor of PolitiFact and a journalism professor at Duke University.
"But I'm not a psychologist and don't try to figure out why people say these things."
Republican candidate Jeb Bush claimed for example that "Florida led the nation in job creation" while he was governor -- a statement given a "four Pinocchios" rating as false by the Washington Post's fact-checker. - AFP

In such an instance, a group of children from the Rotaract Club of American National College and the Interact Club of D S Senanayake College stepped forward to ponder over this miserable situation and made themselves achieve one biggest blessing by offering a fund to this particular child care center.
It was truly amazing to experience the moment that the youngsters who are able to fulfill most of their needs took a chance to understand and provide these innocent children.

India tighten screws on spin-wary South Africa
NAGPUR, Thursday: India seized control of the third Test in Nagpur on Thursday after South Africa, shot out for a record low of 79, fumbled again in their chase of a tough target.
Off-spinner Ravichandran Ashwin finished with five for 32 and Jadeja took four for 33 on a dusty surface at the VCA stadium to bowl South Africa out in 33.1 overs, giving India a first-innings lead of 136 runs.
India were themselves dismissed for 173 runs in their second knock, setting the top-ranked Proteas an improbable target of 310 on a pitch where the ball is turning sharply and keeping low.
South Africa, needing a win to level the four-Test series, ended the second day's play on 32 for two, with Dean Elgar unbeaten on 10 and skipper Hashim Amla on three.
The tourists will start the third day requiring 278 runs more on a dicey pitch that has already claimed 32 wickets over the first two days -- 20 of them on Thursday itself.
Targets of over 300 runs have been chased successfully just once on Indian soil -- by the home team which made 387-4 to defeat England in Chennai in 2008.
Starting the day at 11-2, the Proteas suffered a sensational collapse as they lost three wickets for one run in the first four overs to slip to 12-5.
The world's number one Test side were at that stage in danger of falling below their lowest ever total of 30, but a defiant 35 by JP Duminy saved them the blushes.
But South Africa's meagre score was the lowest total by any team against India, coming in below Sri Lanka's 82 in Chandigarh in 1990. Proteas' coach Russell Domingo refused to criticise the pitch conditions and insisted all was not lost for the tourists yet.
"Some strange things have happened in this game before," Domingo said. "We are obviously a long way behind in this Test at the moment, but we are not discounting ourselves just yet.
"If you're winning the series, it is easy to criticise the pitch, but when you're behind in the series, it is difficult to do so.
"You have to give India credit. They have prepared wickets that suit their style of play and their spinners have been really good. They have bowled outstandingly well and we have not batted as well as we can."
Amla's poor run in the series continued when he gloved an intended sweep off Ashwin to Ajinkya Rahane in the slips after the ball bounced off the wicket-keeper.
Amla, who scored 43, 0 and seven in the three previous innings, managed just a single run this time before walking off even before the umpire gave him out.
Dangerman AB de Villiers failed to score while Faf du Plessis was bowled for 10 when the batsman attempted an ugly heave and missed the line of the ball.
Duminy, who hit two sixes off Jadeja, was ninth out when he was trapped leg-before by leg-spinner Amit Mishra, who was required to bowl just three overs in the entire innings.
When India batted a second time, Shikhar Dhawan (39) and Cheteshwar Pujara (31) showed the way to tackle the turning ball by adding 44 for the second wicket. AFP

## Title: In the land of fraud, loss and dispossession

In the land of fraud, loss and dispossession
This essay is a continuation of the article 'Land fraud, land loss and land rights', published on November 23. It addressed the issue of land fraud, land loss and linked problems. This essay deals with precautions that land owners and buyers could undertake in order to prevent land fraud, reforms and change that need to be brought in and also the extent of land dispossession in Sri Lanka.
What land owners and buyers need to know
Despite the efforts made to curb the presence of land fraud in Sri Lanka, it is still a prevalent issue. There are several precautionary steps that a land owner or buyer can take to reduce the incidence of land fraud.
An important step to take is to check the title to your land at least every six months or so, this is especially important to those that own property which they do not occupy at present, as it is these types of property which are prone to be subject to fraud. If neither the property nor the title to the property is checked regularly it allows room for fraud to take place as someone can forge documents and sell the piece of land and it could be years before the absolute owner realizes that now his title is under dispute. Not maintaining your property also allows room for squatters to takeover and challenge the owner's rights through adverse possession. As a land owner one should also never part with their deeds, except through a lawyer, the reason being that giving out photocopies of your deeds to third parties or brokers could result in the copies being used to create fakes of the original deed.
It is also important to follow the law when buying property, rules even if they are non-compulsory are nevertheless in place as a guideline to ensure that fraud is minimized, thus it is important to follow these rules. The general principle should be 'Buyer Beware', ensure that as a buyer a search is conducted in the land registry to look for legal title to a land. Secondly keep in mind that a good bargain should not be motivation to rush into a sale, do your due diligence, have a surveyor measure the land and establish boundaries, talk to neighbours, make sure the seller is who he says he is. It is also important to find out whether there are any disputes over the land and whether there are conflicting rights that may place your title in question in the future. A deed should be signed by a notary only if the owner is well known to the notary, or in the alternative the owner could provide two witnesses who should be very well acquainted with the owner and the notary.
Finally it is important to be aware about Title Registration and Bim Saviya. At present Deed Registration is practiced in Sri Lanka and Title Registration is being implemented, thus once it is implemented, as a land owner one will be able to register their title to land. It is important for the public to have knowledge about land titling systems in Sri Lanka. Even with the government attempting to educate the public it is not sufficient, especially concerning land owners that live abroad or land owners that live in rural areas with little education or access to the internet.
Where is reform required
The need for reform in land law in Sri Lanka is necessary at both a policy and legal level. Reform needs to take place in a wide array of areas, without which we leave ourselves vulnerable to serious macro-economic consequences.
There is a dire need for more property research in Sri Lanka, with the changeover to Bim Saviya, property research is needed now, more than ever. Research not only on the effects of Title Registration and how effectively it is implemented is necessary but also whether Sri Lanka actually needs the Bim Saviya, and whether it will undermine and cause conflict with other legal systems in Sri Lanka such as Thesawalamai law or Muslim law.
The need for the Bim Saviya and indefeasibility of title in Sri Lanka has been brought into question; indefeasibility of title will result in several innocent parties losing their land or money in the event fraud takes place, thus research into alternative schemes such as Defective Title Insurance needs to conducted. At present the attitude towards Title Insurance is extremely skeptical in Sri Lanka, thus we need to engage in more research to develop it and tailor it to Sri Lanka. When it is a legal requirement to purchase insurance for something as simple as buying a vehicle, it is rather surprising that land transactions that carry a lot of value are not expected to be insured, without insurance there is no consumer protection.
Another area requiring reform is rules relating to Notaries. The Notaries Ordinance at present is a comprehensive and well-functioning set of rules, if applied. Reading the Notaries Ordinance one can see how strictly it governs the practice to avoid fraud. The Notaries Ordinance needs to be made mandatory, and the notarial rules need to be enforced; thus when notaries renew their licenses yearly, they would only be able to do so if they had familiarized themselves with all the new legislation issued for that year. The quality of processing in notarial practice needs to be improved. Another reform that needs to take place concerns the implementation of the Bim Saviya, the proper identification tools need to be implemented alongside the E-land registry such as biometric scanners, GPS and advanced surveying systems.
An increase in land fraud means that the default rates for land mortgages are likely to increase; where a borrower is delinquent in paying the mortgage back, and banks have no choice but to sell the house, and only at this point do they realize that the title of the house/land is in question and they are unable to recover the loan provided. This not only affects the economy adversely but also makes banks more skeptical of borrowers, which is worsened by an unreliable land titling system.
Land dispossession in Sri Lanka
When talking about the issue of land rights and land loss, there are two main issues that come to mind. The first being land fraud which is perpetrated on the law and the second topic for discussion being land dispossession. Especially after the war, land dispossession of people in the North and East is extensive and very little has been done about it. Land dispossession took place through the possession and re-distribution of lands belonging to Muslims either through force or duress by the LTTE in the North, East and areas contiguous.
The State also further took over land for State led developments. Even though in theory all this is based on law, it left a considerable number of people without land or sanctuary. While the progress concerning resettlement of displaced persons has been slow, even the progress made has been in conflict with environmental concerns. There are issues raised surrounding habitation and colonization of land reserves and state owned land including ones around nature reserves for new settlements.
The issue of land dispossession is extensively discussed and there is a lot of awareness about it, nevertheless not even 5% of those that had been expelled from their land have been able to resettle even though it has been nearly quarter of a century since dispossession took place. One of the reasons is now ownership is claimed by others taking over through administrative fiats, which have been the subject of a few longstanding fundamental rights cases or by people that managed to encroach on the land during the war.
While the ethnic and cultural impact the war had on our country is slowly being resolved, those that suffered the most because of it are left without a home. The resettlement initiatives that are underway have unfortunately been in conflict with environmental concerns, with road networks and permanent housing coming up in areas of land reserves and nature reserves, creating questionable conditions for the survival of wildlife in areas that were specifically declared forest reserves under gazette notifications.
While progress is being made it is unfortunate that the issues pertaining to land are not looked at with the severity it should be. Culturally and traditionally it is so important for people to own land in Sri Lanka given that we are an agricultural nation; it's our bread and butter. Land loss in Sri Lanka especially for someone on the lower end of the income scale is something that has much more than a financial impact; it threatens the fundamental values and very mettle of our existence, so why is this not being addressed better Why are we foregoing a constitutional right Sri Lanka is one of the few countries where according to some laws women cannot own land; it is almost audacious that this is accepted in this day and age. Land rights need to be pushed on the agenda as a serious issue; the conversation needs to begin.

Navy's forte is their superior forwards led by former National captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa and have players of the calibre of this year captain Danushka 'Gertha' Perera, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, try machine Sathya Ranatunga, ex-Isipathana and Sri Lanka under 20 skipper Omalka Gunaratna and that fierce tackler and flanker Supun Peiris who learnt the art of rugby from the Navy. The good news for the Navy is the return of second row forward Sagith Saranga for this all important game.
Their back division is strong with the halves combination of Suranga Pushpakumara and veteran Dev Anand hitting it off smoothly in the last game against Air Force. Former Peterite Lee Keegal and his co-centre Kosala Tissera have played a key role in their success with their powerful runs ably supported by National winger Dinusha 'Para' Chathuranga backed up by his omnipresent speedy winger Saliya Hadapangoda and attacking full back Thilina Weerasinghe.
Navy head coach Nilfer Ibrahim said, "We were happy about our last performance in the opening match of the season. Due to 13 experienced players leaving us we were playing with virtually a new look side, I honestly never thought we would win, but the boys played really well and brought us the important win even though the ground conditions was not that good.
"Our forwards played a cracking game and secured us the ball position for our young three quarters to do the rest. Please keep in mind, we had almost 11 schoolboys playing for us; but in the end they gave a fantastic performance."
Army led by national player Ashoka Jayalal, fielding a young side with no superstars went down fighting against the CR and FC last Saturday 35-15 after a remarkable performance. Army will strive to give a much better performance against the Navy outfit by going all out to register their first win of the season.
The centres combination of brothers Imanka Ariyapala and Dinusha Ariyapala play with perfect understanding while Mihiran Perera has played a key role in their success with his daring runs down the flank. Full back Gayan Salinda has also come off with flying colours with his bulls-eye place kicking.
The Army has been bolstered by the presence of their halves combination of Rizvi Mohamad and Ashan Bandara and they will be tested to the hilt by the experience Navy three quarters.
Assistant coach cum team manager Captain Nisal Meepage said, "We identified last week our mistakes which cost us the game against CR and worked out and rectified them. Our cover defence of the three quarters was very poor and we have to improve on that as well. We are a really confident unit going for a definite victory." - WAI

New ICC chief hits out at 'bullying' big 3 nations
New Delhi, Thursday: New International Cricket Council chairman Shashank Manohar has hit out at the imbalance of the sport's governing body which he said allowed Australia, England and India to bully the organisation.
Manohar, who replaced India's scandal-tainted former supremo Narayanaswami Srinivasan earlier this month, said he disagreed with changes to the ICC which handed more power to the big three nations of the game.
"I don't agree with the three major countries bullying the ICC," Manohar told the Hindu newspaper in an interview published on Thursday.
"That's my personal view, because as I have always said, an institution is bigger than individuals."
A controversial and wide-ranging shake up of the ICC last year gave India -- which contributes 80 percent of global revenues -- and fellow powerhouses England and Australia permanent seats on a new five-member executive committee. AFP

Families can look forward to even more enhancements by the end of the year. This includes a new range of kid's greeting cards to celebrate special occasions on board, and refreshed photo cards for cabin crew to capture special moments with an instant Polaroid camera.

No war with Turkey over 'Planned Provocation' jet downing - Russian FM
RUSSIA: Russia's foreign minister today said the downing of its fighter jet by Turkey appeared to be a "planned provocation" but said the countries would not go to war over the incident.
"We have serious doubts about this being an unpremeditated act, it really looks like a planned provocation," Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said at a press conference in Moscow after speaking with Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu.
"We do not plan to go to war with Turkey, our attitude toward the Turkish people has not changed," Lavrov added, stressing that Moscow would however "seriously reevaluate" its ties with Ankara. "Such attacks are absolutely unacceptable," he said.
Lavrov also backed a proposal by French President Francois Hollande to close off the Syrian-Turkish border to prevent fighters from flooding into Syria, saying the idea may be raised by Hollande during his visit to Moscow on Thursday.
Russian authorities reacted furiously to the downing of the Russian Su-24 warplane on the Syrian border on Tuesday, with President Vladimir Putin calling it a "stab in the back committed by accomplices of terrorists". - AFP

Pakistan PM gives green light to play India in Sri Lanka
ISLAMABAD: Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif has permitted the Pakistani cricket team to play a series against India in Sri Lanka next month, Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) sources said on Thursday. According to a source in the Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), the prime minister gave his approval for the India series only after Sri Lanka was finalised as the venue for the fixtures.
"The Pakistan government never had a problem with the series going ahead. It only had reservations about the team travelling to India amid the prevailing tensions," the source said. Indian Premier League Chairman and BCCI functionary Rajeev Shukla told reporters the series is likely to happen from December 15 in Sri Lanka.
"India-Pakistan series will happen tentatively from December 15 in Sri Lanka," he said.
Pakistan and India's cricket boards have been deadlocked for months on a venue for the series. India had refused to play in the United Arab Emirates and Pakistan rejected the Indian board's proposal to play the series in India.
Giles Clarke, who heads International Cricket Council's Pakistan Task Force, organised a meeting in Dubai between the heads of two cricket boards last week where Sri Lanka was chosen as the venue.
ESPN Cricinfo reported on Wednesday that both the Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) and the PCB confirmed they had written to their respective government's for clearance for the tour.
The series, comprising three ODIs and two T20s, is expected to kick off on December 20, most likely in Pallekele or Colombo.
"PCB can benefit from the Indo-Pak series in Sri Lanka by earning up to Rs3 billion ahead of the Pakistan Super League (PSL) in February next year," a source earlier said.
Pakistan and India have not played a bilateral series since 2007.
Under the Memorandum of Understanding both the boards had agreed in 2014, six series were scheduled between 2015 and 2023, with four series to be hosted by Pakistan.
But all series were subject to clearance from the respective governments. Dawn

Price formula for petroleum products soon - Chandima
A price formula for petroleum products will be introduced soon aiming to provide relief to customers with the drastic price drop of crude oil in the world market, Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Minister Chandima Weerakkody said.
He said the price formula will probably be introduced in the first quarter of next year.
"The Petroleum and Petroleum Gas Ministry is engaging in discussions with the Consumer Affairs Authority to formulate the price formula. It is necessary to look into various sectors such as transportation prior to formulating the formula," he said.
A final discussion in this regard will be held next week and the formula will be formulated accordingly, the minister added.
He added that the price of a barrel of crude oil is around US $ 50 and therefore there should be a scientific method for pricing petroleum products according to the price fluctuation of world market.

UK: Tickets to Britain's Queen Elizabeth II's 90th birthday celebrations sold out within hours today as Buckingham Palace promised four days of pageantry "fit for the queen" including dancing and horse shows.
Britain's longest-ever reigning monarch, Elizabeth turns 90 on April 21 next year and the palace has organised a public celebration lasting four days at Windsor Castle, one of her residences outside London. The 25,000 tickets for the events between May 12-15 cost up to 165 Pounds (234 euros, $249), with the most expensive places situated next to the "Royal Enclosure" where royals might attend.
The queen herself will attend the finale on Sunday and proceeds from the sale will go to charity, Buckingham Palace said.
Those unable to buy tickets can still apply for one of 5,000 free slots, allowing them to watch the ceremony on a screen and watch celebrities arrive.
The ceremonies will involve 900 horses and 1,500 artists including dancers, musicians and actors from around the world, the palace said.
Around 100 bagpipe players will also take part.
The queen is expected to celebrate her actual birthday in private and then take part in an official yearly ceremony known as the Trooping the Colour in June. - AFP

Saying 'Illegal Immigrants' was poor word choice - Hillary Clinton
US: Hillary Rodham Clinton said on Tuesday that her use of the term "illegal immigrants" was a "poor choice of words" and she pledged not to use it anymore, responding to criticism from immigration activists.
The Democratic presidential front-runner was asked about her use of the term to describe people who are in the U.S. illegally during a question-and-answer session on Facebook held by Telemundo. The question came from Jose Antonio Vargas, a filmmaker and journalist whose organization, Define American, has said the terminology is offensive and asked all presidential candidates to stop using it.
"Yes, I will," Clinton wrote during a stop in Boulder, Colorado. "That was a poor choice of words. As I've said throughout this campaign, the people at the heart of this issue are children, parents, families, DREAMers. They have names and hopes and dreams that deserve to be respected."
DREAMers take their name from the acronym for legislation that lays out a process toward citizenship for immigrants who were brought into the country illegally as children and grew up in the United States. - NDTV

Tainted Lanka Sathosa Chief Engineer back in the saddle
A top official attached to a leading state commercial establishment, who had been asked to stay out by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate serious Frauds and Corruption due to his Involvement in alleged fraudulent practices has found his way back to a top slot in a ministry. The officer in question K. Ariyawansa, former chief engineer of Lanka Sathosa, whose services were terminated over an alleged multi-million rupee scam, has been appointed to a top position in the Industry and Commerce Ministry. He was recalled to duty by Industry and Commerce Minister Rishard Bathiudeen and Ministry Secretary T.N.K.B. Tennakoon, a group of officers and Auditors from Lanka Sathosa states in a written complaint submitted to the Presidential Commission.
The contract of employment of this Lanka Sathosa official and several others was terminated after a directive by the Presidential Commission of Inquiry to Investigate and Inquire into Serious Acts of Fraud,Corruption and Abuse of Power, State Resources and Privileges (PRECIFAC), which probed the scam of over Rs 20,000 million in Lanka Sathosa.
A group of Sathosa employees petitioned the PRECIFAC against the recall of K.Ariyawansha. They have noted that Ariyawansha had allegedly been involved in several financial irregularities at Lanka Sathosa and was trying to intimidate officials who are to give evidence in connection with these irregularities and misled the PRECIFAC by preparing forged documents.
They have further said that a billionaire businessman named Sathasiwam Winsendra Rajan was also allegedly involved in these frauds and they were all trying to hush up these investigations with the help of a prominent Minister.
Lanka Sathosa employees urged the PRECIFAC to take immediate action in this connection. Meanwhile, when queried Industries and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.N.B.K.Tennakoon said that there is nothing further to discuss about the decision of the Ministry.
"K.Ariyawansa was removed according to the order of the PRECEFAC and we recruited him to the duties in the Industries and Commerce Ministry" he added.
Talking about the issue PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said that the commission had taken some essential decisions which the people cannot override. "We never change our decision related with this issue and we are ready to take strict measures against people who go beyond our decisions. No person can meddle in the inquiries of the PRECIFAC and we will do our maximum if they neglect or go beyond the commission's decision" he said.
Ministry Secretary says...
Expressing his ideas about the allegation, Industries and Commerce Ministry Secretary T.N.B.K. Tennakoon said there was nothing more to discuss about the decision.
"K. Ariyawansha was removed from the CAA according to the order of PRECIFAC and we recruited him to the Industries and Commerce Ministry," Tennakoon said.
PRECIFAC Secretary Lacille de Silva said the commission had taken some important decisions which the public cannot change.
"We never change our decision related with this issue and we are ready to take strict measures against the people who go beyond our decisions. No person can meddle in PRECIFAC inquiries. We will do our maximum if they neglect or go beyond the commission decisions," he said.

Though a portrait of the Tiger leader was placed on the stage, no floral tribute was paid as the supporters had rejected the reports of Prabhakarans death.
Cakes were distributed at the office of Thanthai Periyar Dravidar Kazhagam at Royapettah at midnight, while MDMK general secretary Vaiko distributed sweets at the party office. VCK leader AThol Thirumavalavan too cut the birthday cake at his party office.

[Cross Currents]
Thoughts on the Budget
Last week the Government presented its Budget for the year 2016. The Finance Minister's Budget Speech went on for a record time of over four hours. Had he read out the sections he tabled it would have taken him over five hours.
Despite the hype in the preceding days the budget looked the same in its outlook in comparison with previous budgets. In other words it is the same old story of hopes, aspirations, old prescriptions and appeals.
It is, however, the first budget of the UNP-SLFP Government. The fact that their united product is the same as what they have been producing over the years individually or separately is yet another confirmation that these two parties stand for the same policies and programmes of development. Differences between them are mostly tactical and sectarian. It could be seen in the nomenclature too, e.g., Janasaviya and Samurdhi.
During the elections the United National Party made a claim that it has found an elixir for the ills of the Sri Lanka and identified it as a Social Market economy. We, in this column, previously said this so called Social Market economy is nothing but a neo-liberal economy which had to change names due to its unpopularity and obvious weaknesses and failures. Budget 2016 has confirmed our opinion. It has no vision for an independent economic development for the country. The repeated references and eulogy to the previous UNP administrations during the Finance Minister's speech including the fast-tracked reforms of the 1977 Government shows the continuation of this no-liberal policy without any substantial change. In fact the talk is not about a social market but about Third generation reforms of the same old order.
Ensure growth with equity
It is true that the masses have been provided with some relief which, however, pales into insignificance compared with the relief granted to the capitalists both local and foreign. It is like a cake in which the soft icing resembles the concessions to the masses and the more nutritious or relatively hard body of the cake resembles the concessions to the capitalists. Icing by its nature melts and one would not be surprised if the price reductions granted in the budget melt away due either to fluctuations in the world market or a depreciation of our floating Rupee.
Obviously the budget has a focus on development. The fault does not lie there. It is in the way or the strategy for such development that is disturbing, especially the transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. It is doubtful whether the strategy adapted would ensure growth with equity. Over three and half decades of the open economy with or without a human face has not ensured equity so far. Doubts remain as to the ultimate result of several projects such as the proposed utilization of EPF and ETF funds to form a "Fund of Funds" with public-private partnership to provide venture capital to SMEs and the amalgamation of the EPF and the ETF, the pruning of certain subsidies and the introduction of voucher schemes without pilot projects to ascertain their efficacy and viability. The same goes for Special Purpose Vehicles (SPVs) proposed for projects in the transport and power sectors.
Unlike the sops granted to the masses concessions to the investors and their local counterparts are of a more lasting nature. They include exemptions and substantial reductions of tax for three to five years as well as long-term leasing of state lands. Disturbing also is the proposal to provide tax free ownership of land to foreigners.
Foreign investment
Regressive from the point of view of the working population is the extension of the period of contract labour prior to confirmation in the permanent cadre from six months to one year. It is well known that employers are in the habit of breaking the service of contract labour not allowing them to work 180 days consecutively so that after six months they could again be hired as fresh labour on contract. Contract labour is denied several facilities that permanent labour enjoys and thus this is a method of curtailing workers' rights. The introduction of a contributory pension scheme for new entrants to the public service from January 2016 is also a curtailment of an existing right of public servants which in effect amounts to a reduction in their salaries.
The proof of the pudding is in the eating, says an old adage. Similarly the success of the failure of the budget would be seen in its implementation. It would largely depend on how much foreign investment would flow into the country and on the viability of private-public partnerships (PPPs). Though the Finance Minister has offered so many opportunities to the private sector it is a moot point whether they would reciprocate in a like manner. Traditionally our capitalists have been unable to get over their inertia and have been reluctant to take risks. It would be interesting in this regard to find out how many have made use of the facilities given in earlier budgets for various industries, particularly for agri-business and agro-industries. Thus the success of the budget would depend on a lot of "ifs".
Further there are several proposals which are offered as suggestions to the private sector and thus lack any legal validity. They include appeals for public-private partnerships as well as the proposal for a five day working week. There is also the possibility of abusing the suggestion to introduce part-time work to the detriment of the working people and organized labour.
The efficacy of the utilization of budgetary allocations would depend on several other factors including political and policy decisions in other spheres. For example, the government has increased budgetary allocations for education and health. It is commendable. But much would depend on how they are implemented. It would be a futile effort and waste of funds if the expenditure on education is not accompanied by an improvement of its quality. It means not only what is taught but also how it is taught. Again there is an open door for the private sector to join in the effort to improve education. If this participation is not accompanied by proper regulations it could result in the mushrooming of educational institutions that are sub-standard.
The public sector in Sri Lanka is also noted for its inertia, corruption and inefficiency. If there is no public sector reform addressing these concerns budget implementation would be an uphill task.
Finally one has to emphasize the necessity for the Government to maintain public trust it enjoys. Sad to say that it has been eroded over the last few months especially on account of its slow progress on dealing with corruption, fraud and misuse of private property as well as its apparent co-habitation with personalities tainted with corruption etc. Also the culture of political and personal favouritism still prevails in the appointments to high positions despite the talk to the contrary.
Even with all these defects the budget is a step forward from the former regime. While the former regime had the objective of developing a form of autocratic crony capitalism the present government's objective is for a comparatively more democratic bourgeois development.

Tiesh celebrates the mystique of Black Silver
Tiesh unveiled its latest collection of exquisite black silver jewellery themed Black Temptations to some of its loyal customers, family, friends and media last week in a very glitzy affair. These new collections are all studded with precious and semi-precious stones belonging to Sri Lanka.
"Mainly we want to highlight the Sri Lankan stones so from sapphires and semi precious stones. We found that using black plating on the silver enhances the coulour and also gives it a vivid kind of kalaiedoskope of colours and it's not just one colour that you get. So we thought by doing this something new and a first in Sri Lanka we could launch in a big way. We want the public in on our little secret. The stones come from Rathnapura (it been the hub gem and jewelry trade in Sri Lanka), but also Matale and Kandy. We believe that these pieces can be worn for multipurpose occasions depending on what you choose to go for as it could be a very good conversation starter. You wear it and it would get the attention of whoever you meet", Tiesh Director Ayesh de Fonseka stated at the launch of Black Temptations.
"The black rhodium plated 925 sterling silver collection presents itself in an amazing range of shades of grey ranging from enigmatic deep dark greys to almost full black bringing out an ephemeral element of illusion and mystique. Enhancing this mood and heightening the element of colour and fantasy is the delightful array of sparkling Sri Lankan gem stones which liberally embellish each piece of jewellery", he added.
In a press release issued it said that customers can sit with Tiesh's jewellery designers and create their own little masterpieces. Each one-of-a-kind piece from a necklace, bracelet, earring, pendant and ring will complement the other and will stand out strikingly, either singly or in an ensemble.

The Trimaran "Qingdao China" in Mirissa
As part of the project "Guo Chuan Racing" to sail across the "21st Century Maritime Silk Road", the 29.7 m trimaran Qingdao China called over to the fishing harbour of Mirissa on November 16, 17 and 18 and was welcomed by officials of Ceylon Fishery Harbours Corporation, Board of Investment and Sri Lanka Coast Guard.
Sri Lanka and Qingdao in China share a common dream, the development of sailing and environmentally friendly recreational activities. The Building A Future Foundation (www.baflk.org) and its spinoff company Sail Lanka Charter (www.sail-lanka-charter.com) have been playing a pioneering role in the development of yachting - and water based tourism in Sri Lanka, together with the tremendous support from CFHC, EDB and BOI. The arrival of such an exceptional racing catamaran is only the beginning of more yachts that will include Sri Lanka on their route. To achieve this BAFF has built the first mini-marina's in Sri Lanka and has been trying hard to link up with other yachting hubs in the world.
"Potential of Sri Lanka as a yachting destination is huge! In China it took us 10 years to develop this industry. We have now marinas and sailing vessels all around our coast, but 10 years ago we were where you are now", Skipper Guo Chang commented.
"We have never been in such a harbour. Having our last generation trimaran in Mirissa fishing harbour is a proof that something is happening here", Quentin, crew of the trimaran added.
The organisers of the event "Guo Chuan Racing" (www.guochuansailing.com), associated to the movement "Peace and Sport" from Monaco, have chosen to moor in Mirissa, to mark the common visions to develop sustainable water based activities, creating local and environmentally friendly job opportunities.
In response to the warm welcome received in Sri Lanka, Liu Yu, Director of the Qingdao Administration Centre of Sailing Sport has decided invited 6 kids and 2 adults to participate in the next Qingdao sailing games in August 2016. They will bear all local expenses (accommodation, food, transfers, boats, equipment), while BAFF will try to find a sponsor for the flight tickets.
The trimaran Qingdao China, now belonging to the Chinese skipper Guo Chuan, has in the past posted several race records under command of the French sailor Francis Joyon.
The boat will further proceed along the silk route with stops in Mumbai, Alexandria and Monaco where it will participate in major sailing events, to showcase that Asian countries like China and Sri Lanka are ready and keen to develop this kind of activities. In this frame Sail Lanka Charter will join the effort by representing Sri Lanka as a yachting destination at the number 1 international boat show "Nautic" in Paris from December 5 till 13, 2015. The Building a Future Foundation founded in March 2006 in order to train youth into innovative activities and new skills which have an economic development potential, aims to promote and establish a boating and sailing culture in Sri Lanka, which in the long run will create a leisure boating market, with thousands of sustainable employment opportunities for the youth, in boat building as well as in chartering operations.
We believe that Sri Lanka has the potential to become the global yachting destination in South Asia. Thailand, which began incentivizing yachting just 10 years ago, now, has a thriving industry that employs over 30,000 people directly and indirectly supporting thousands of livelihoods. Sri Lanka is even better positioned than Thailand with excellent sailing conditions year round and the ability to leverage Sri Lanka's unique tourism potential to offer a diverse range of packages.

A Truly Magical Christmas at the Kiddies Winter Wonderland
Every year it is the children that enjoy Christmas the most. It is these little ones who wait for this one day for an entire year and all celebrations are centered on making their little dreams come true.
In keeping with this tradition Waters Edge has transformed their premises in to the magical "Winter Wonderland" complete with Santa's sleigh and reindeer parked on the front floor, a giant Christmas tree made from glass tubes and fairy lights illuminating the entire surroundings.
On December 6, the hotel will hold their third annual "Kiddies Christmas Party" at the Grand Lawn from 3.30pm to 6.30pm. Santa himself will make a non-traditional yet grand appearance on a sea plane while his merry little elves will arrive on a boat. The traditional lighting of the Water's Edge Christmas tree will take place later that evening.
"The Water's Edge Kiddies Christmas Party is the highlight of the season for us at the hotel. Every department gets so deeply involved in making this day extra special for all the little ones who come in wide-eyed wonder to see what special offerings we have for them every year. Our chefs go all out to make mouth-watering treats, while the dcor and event teams put their creative caps on to make magic. We are very excited to see the reactions of the children this year when they walk in to the Winter Wonderland", Water's Edge Director - Sales and Marketing Thilanka Muthukumarana noted.
Kids of all ages and their parents can enjoy a variety of games and activities such as water walkers, face painting, nail art, pony rides, balloon magic, an assortment of bouncers, bowling, a balloon dunk tank, lazer games, merry-go-round, giant wheel, fun train rides and much more. Special appearances by cartoon characters and superheroes such as Dora, Batman, Ironman and Thor will also be a highlight of the evening. A scrumptious buffet overflowing with traditional Christmas favourites will also be on display as a compliment to the culinary prowess of the Water's Edge chefs. Parents also have the opportunity of handing over their children's special Christmas gifts to the hotel prior to the event so that Santa can hand them out on the day.
To add even more reason to celebrate, Water's Edge will also offer many prizes and surprises to kids participating at the event. The first prize is a 15min scenic helicopter ride for 4 people sponsored by SimpliFly, while the second prize will be a complimentary 10pax kid's birthday party at Water's Edge. A third place winner will also walk away with a complimentary 2kg decorative cake from Water's Edge for their next birthday.

Unveiling Sri Lanka's first ever co-created dance video
Closeup marked a historic milestone with the launch of the country's first ever co-created dance video on December 13. Closeup sparked the imagination of the youth of Sri Lanka and created phenomenal online buzz and conversations. This enthusiasm culminated with 100 couples being chosen from over a 1000 entries to appear alongside brand ambassadors Dushyanth Weeraman and Stephanie Siriwardene in the final electrifying and dynamic video which can be viewed at www.facebook.com/closeupsrilanka.
As the passion for dance and music is closely entwined in the identity of our nation's youth it was only natural that Closeup - a brand in-sync with the needs and desires of the youth - initiated a campaign that allowed youth to confidently express their passion. It was a campaign that was met with great fervor and was quickly adopted by the nation's youth both online and off. The excitement surrounding this innovative concept peaked with the brand's Facebook page being flooded with questions, comments and videos.
And as further testament to Closeup's understanding of Sri Lanka's youth they were able to mobilize their strong fan base and partnered with them at popular youth hangouts to recreate the exciting dance moves. Those that participated won valuable gifts for their stellar effort from Closeup's partners, Barista Lavazza and Cinnamon Hotels & Resorts.
"The response to the campaign has been amazing and a big thank you must go out to everyone who sent in their video entries, we were truly blown away by how in-sync the dancers were with each other and we are very excited about releasing the final video, and having gotten a sneak peek at it, I must say that it looks spectacular," Unilever Sri Lanka Closeup Brand Manager Aaqib Reyal stated.
