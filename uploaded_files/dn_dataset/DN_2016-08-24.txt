Marvellous Rio flames  out as Super Abe takes baton

Rio de Janeiro, Sunday: The Rio Olympics ended in a blaze of colour with an exuberant closing ceremony on Sunday as Tokyo took up the baton promising to host the best Games yet in 2020. After a rollercoaster fortnight which mixed off-field hitches with compelling sporting drama, Olympics chief Thomas Bach hailed a marvellous Games in the Brazilian city.
These were marvellous Olympic Games in the marvellous city! said Bach, as he declared the Games closed and the Olympic flame was extinguished.
These Olympic Games are leaving a unique legacy for generations to come. History will talk about a Rio de Janeiro before and a much better Rio de Janeiro after the Olympic Games.
Just a few hours earlier, the United States basketball squad won the last gold of the Games, boosting their countrys place on top of the medals table.
At the closing ceremony, thousands of fans and athletes donned ponchos on a wet and windy night for a colourful festival of Brazilian culture and music with bursts of spectacular fireworks.
Smiling and waving athletes danced into the Maracana stadium taking selfies as Rios 16-day Summer Games closed ahead of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo. Japans Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made a comical cameo as Nintendo video game character Super Mario as Tokyo set out its stall for 2020.
The Japanese government will... work hard so it will be the best Olympics ever, Abe said as he met Japanese medal-winners earlier.
Security scares and logistical problems were a feature of South Americas first Olympics, held against the backdrop of Brazils political and economic crisis.
Swathes of empty seats caused disquiet but the Games also witnessed the last hurrahs of both Usain Bolt and Michael Phelps, who both lived up to their billing. Bolt sealed the sprint triple triple in his final Games, reaching a record-equalling nine gold medals with his third consecutive 100m, 200m and 4x100m sweep.
Swim legend Phelps took his unmatched career haul to 23 gold medals with another five in Rio -- plus a silver, after his loss to former childhood fan Joseph Schooling.
Brazil came late to the party but the country celebrated long and loud when Neymar won a gold-medal penalty shoot-out against Germany to erase memories of their 7-1 World Cup semi-final humiliation in 2014. On a sodden final day, Kenyas Eliud Kipchoge, 31, shone with his seventh win in eight marathons, timing 2hr 8min 44sec to win by more than a minute. The USAs basketball Dream Team of NBA stars claimed the 306th and final gold of the Games with a crushing 96-66 win over Serbia.
With the basketball win, America matched its tally of 46 golds from London four years ago to lead the medals table from Britain, who sealed surprise second place ahead of China with 27 golds to 26.
We are one of those sporting superpowers now, beamed UK Sport chief executive Liz Nicholl.
For China, the worlds most populous country, it was the worst Olympics for 20 years -- especially sobering after topping the standings at Beijing 2008 and finishing second in 2012.
China brought to Rio a youthful team with an average age of 24, the lowest of the last three Olympics.

This points to a rebuilding phase ahead of the 2020 Olympics in Tokyo, the capital of Chinas war-time rival and former colonial power which still evokes bitter resentment among many Chinese.
A string of below-par performances saw India win just two medals, fewer than the six clinched during their best-ever performance in London four years earlier. There was also controversy as Mongolias Chagnaadorj Usukhbayar became the sixth weightlifter in Rio to fail a drugs test. And police seized passports, phones and computers in a raid on the Irish Olympic office, following the arrest of Irish International Olympic Committee member Patrick Hickey over an alleged black market tickets scam.
Brazil added a final flourish as they beat Italy 3-0 to win the mens title in volleyball, one of the countrys most popular sports.
French fighter Tony Yoka won a split-decision against Britains Joe Joyce to take the super-heavyweight title in boxing. Switzerlands world champion Nino Schurter, third in Beijing and second in London, competed his ascent of the podium by winning the mens mountain bike competition. And there were furious scenes when a Mongolian coach stripped down to his underwear to protest a decision against wrestler Ganzorig Mandakhnaran. AFP

Marathon man  Cooray undecided  about future

RIO DE JANEIRO, Monday: Former South Asian Games gold medallist Anuradha Indrajith Cooray said he will take a final decision about his athletic career after discussing the matter with the Sports Minister and sports officials, including those in the National Olympic Committee.
Speaking to media before his departure from the Olympic city, the 38-year-old veteran long distance runner said he is still undecided on his future. There is no age barrier for long distance running and there are several good marathon runners who are older than me and doing well. Its a matter of stamina, staying power and endurance you develop over a period of time, he said.
Once I go back to Sri Lanka, I want to discuss about my sports future with the Sports Minister, Olympic and other athletic officials. If they support me further to sustain in the sport and contribute to Sri Lanka sport, I am willing to do that, he said.
Cooray feels that there is some more athletics left in him and is keen to contribute for Sri Lanka sport until the country finds somebody better than him. I am not going to hang on to this place if there is somebody who could run at least closer to my timings. I will retire immediately if there is somebody who could run a marathon under two hours and 20 minutes, he said he would give all support and encouragement to any of up and coming marathon runner from Sri Lanka.
The London-based long distance expert said he is even winning to lend a helping hand to any Lankan marathon runner who is capable of achieving a better timing than him. As I said, I will not only encourage any emerging marathon runner from my country who could do a 2:20 but would also use my contacts to find a training opportunity in Kenya, he said.
Cooray who has been a frequent visitor to Kenya to train alongside some of the top long distance runners in the world, produced by the African nation, said he was happy with his performance at the 2016 Olympic marathon yesterday. Cooray clocked two hours, 17 minutes and six seconds to finish 34th out of 155 competitors.
It was not easy, running a marathon against the cream of world class marathon runners in the world. Most of them had full scholarships and sponsorships. In contrast, I only had the normal monthly allowance paid by the ports Ministry to Olympic athletes, that too during the last few months. I also had a short training opportunity in Kenya prior to the last South Asian Games. I am not trying to put the blame on anyone, but just explaining my plight, he added.
It is a struggle when I have to work for my living and to find time for athletic training. If the Sports Ministry could grant me a better allowance, I could reduce some of my overtime work in the job and use that precious time to train a longer duration, he explained.
I feel that I have something more to offer for Sri Lanka. If I gain support from the authorities, I will continue to run until the next Asian Games. Then I would make my own evaluation. If I find there is nobody close to my timings even then, I would continue to work harder and qualify for the next Olympics as well, said Cooray, who has now taken part in three Olympic Games  Athens 2004, London 2012 and Rio 2016.
Cooray was not among the first 65 runners in Rio 2016 marathon until he reached the first 15km but since then, gradually accelerated to advance. The most notable advancement made by Cooray in the whole race was between the 35 to 40km marks. By the 40km mark, he stormed into the 36th place in 2:09.50. I holding on to the batch with Canadian runners and that made my task easier. Overall, I am happy with my performance in Rio Olympics, he concluded.

Charlemagne wins Sports Ministry Cup
An action packed Saturday morning kicked off with the inauguration of the newly built Saddling Enclosure at the Royal Turf Club (RTC) in Little England - yet another achievement in improving the infrastructure of the RTC.
It would be a race against time to see if the card of 6 races followed by an auction sale of Thoroughbreds would go through without the rain playing spoilsport.
It was a perfect day for horseracing in Nuwara Eliya where some really competitive racing backed by superb entertainment showcased.
The first Race of the afternoon, The Victoria Turf Club Cup saw Stormy Petrel (Burden of Proof ex Stormy Affair) storm out of the gates and after that there was no looking back. The mare sported the colours of Anjali Stables and she was trained by SV Madialingam and ridden by A. Vishwanath.
The Sugathadasa Stadium Cup had excitement even before the start thanks to a colt named Stockwell who did a houdini act by getting out of the gates after being stalled and then bolting. He was subsequently withdrawn and it was left to Don Hasa (Strength to Succeed ex Fleet Footed) from the Selvaratnam stable who won effortlessly from end to end. The Sports Ministry Challenge Cup came up next and it was easy picking for Charlemagne who gave the Anjali Stables of Owner James Matthew a super double. The Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara gave away the trophy to the winner.
And then came the icing on the cake as the minister joined the band to regale the appreciative crowd with some awesome singing. The crowd wouldn't let him go and he happily obliged with an encore.
The RTC Auction Sale Trophy was up next and considering the first ever Auction Sale of Thoroughbreds involved 15 Indian horses it should have been a pointer.
Indian Epic was the choice and he did it in style to become the fourth winner in succession to win from start to finish.
Owned by Isira Dassanayake, Indian Epic was trained by SD Lalith and ridden by C Umesh.
The RTC Nuwara Eliya Cup for Sri Lankan breds was won effortlessly by Airborne II and then in the last race the RTC Winners Trophy which was also for Sti Lankan breds, City Shot bounced to the front and never looked back to win easy.
A great day of racing. Punctuated with some super entertainment and fashion.

Another failed campaign but the cavalcade goes on
Is participation at the Olympic Games is all that matters Or so it seems especially for a country like Sri Lanka who lives upto to the famous saying of the father of modern Olympics Pierre de Coubertin to the very letter.
One of De Coubertins many famous quotes was: The most important thing in the Olympic Games is not winning but taking part; the essential thing in life is not conquering but fighting well, and another, The important thing in life is not to triumph but to compete.
Sri Lankas poor record at the Olympics suggests that the contingent of athletes they send for the Olympics are nowhere close to winning a medal for the country even though certain competitors achieved qualifying standards in their respective events.
One cannot lay the blame squarely on the competitors for their poor show. With their limited resources and finances they try hard individually to achieve success for their motherland, but compared to other countries they are so far behind in training and technology that they are no match when they face the starters order.
This where the Ministry of Sports, the NOC and the national sports bodies need to come in. There needs to be long term planning to achieve success where the athlete is given a proper trainer (international if possible), a training schedule and an international events schedule to prepare for the event ahead well in advance so that he or she is at peak when the real action commences.
The lack of international exposure, latest equipment and latest technology has been one of the biggest setbacks for the athlete and there is no long term planning but short term goals when the Olympics is around the corner.
If one is to analyse the comments the nine or so athletes who participated at the Rio Games made prior to their events, none of them said that they were confident of winning a medal.
The average comments made by them were that they would try to improve their personal timings or personal marks. That statement alone suggests how ill-prepared they were going into the Olympics.
Sri Lanka have been taking part at the Olympics since 1948 and all what they have to show is two Olympic silver medals in athletics 52 years apart.
On their Olympic debut at London in 1948 Sri Lankas Duncan White won a silver in the mens 400 metres hurdles. That achievement was equaled in 2000 at Sydney by Susanthika Jayasinghe when she took the silver in the womens 200 metres.
For the past 16 years, in the last four Olympic Games, Sri Lanka has failed to produce any performance close enough to winning a medal.
What the Olympics have turned out to be is a tamasha for NOC officials and Sports Ministry officials to go on joy rides at state expense.
The NOC is shrewd enough to accommodate officials of the Sports Ministry including the Minister of Sports at every Olympics so that the Ministry turns a blind eye on all the wrong-doings that take place.
Has the Minister of Sports ever initiated an inquiry into why the Lankan contingent fails to bring home a medal at successive Olympics
They are keen to initiate probes into other sports like cricket for instance whenever the team returns after a disastrous tour, so why not the Olympics where so much of publicity is given for empty returns.
The International Olympic Committee (IOC) provides funds to each of its member-countries and whether they are utilized through the proper chanels is questionable. No one dares question the NOC of how it dispenses its funds.
There have been several allegations leveled against the NOC of how they conduct themselves and on the process of nominating media personnel to cover the Olympics.
The allegations are that those who write in favour of the NOC and have good relations with its hierarchy become their blue-eyed boys and they always find their way to cover each and every Olympics whereas those who are critical of the NOC are left to find their own way to the Games.
This has been the practice that has been going on for so long and the carnival continues unheeded just like the number of officials who outnumber the competitors at each and every Olympics.
Sri Lanka will never learn from their mistakes and as long as this current trend continues they will always be also-rans at every world stage.

CA praises Pakistans ascension to no.1 in Test ranking
Cricket Australia chief executive James Sutherland has congratulated Pakistan on their rise to the top of world cricket, which has come despite them being unable to play matches on home soil for more than six years.
Pakistan was confirmed as the new number one ranked Test nation on Tuesday following the drawn fourth Test between India and the West Indies in Trinidad, a match the tourists needed to win to remain at the top of the International Cricket Councils Test rankings.
Its the first time Pakistan has secured top spot since the rankings were introduced in 2003 and Sutherland says the achievement is even more impressive given they have been forced to play their home matches in the United Arab Emirates since 2009 due to security fears.
Id just like to acknowledge that effort of Pakistan being the No.1 ranked team for the first time in Test cricket, Sutherland said.
Its quite a remarkable effort and very significant in the context of them not being able to play matches at home.
And on behalf of everyone in Australian cricket, I say congratulations to Pakistan.
Pakistans new status as Test crickets benchmark will be challenged later this year when they travel to the Antipodes for a Test series in New Zealand (featuring Tests in Christchurch and Hamilton in November) and then Australia for matches in Brisbane, Melbourne and Sydney over the festive period.
While Pakistan have a winning record in New Zealand  theyve lost just five of 29 Tests theyve played there since 1965  they will have to reverse more than five decades of history if they are to have success in Australia, where theyve won just four of 32 Tests.
Pakistans next Test assignment is set to be a home series against the West Indies in October, the details of which are yet to be determined.

Heros welcome for Indonesian gold medallists
Indonesian Olympic gold medal winners Tontowi Ahmad and Liliyana Natsir were given a heros welcome Tuesday by hundreds of flag-waving fans as the badminton champions returned home.
They arrived at Jakarta airport to enthusiastic scenes from the waiting crowd, before travelling through the capital in an open-top, double-decker bus.
Ahmad thanked the sports minister and others who supported the players for helping us achieve this success.
Hopefully our success can be repeated by our juniors and other athletes, hopefully this will motivate them, he said.
At the welcoming ceremony, Sports Minister Imam Nahrawi hailed the players victory as the answer to eight years of yearning for an Olympic gold medal. Ahmad and Natsir were Indonesias only gold medal winners in Rio, beating Chan Peng Soon and Goh Liu Ying of Malaysia in the badminton mixed doubles.
It was the countrys first Olympic gold since the Beijing games in 2008.
The players will both receive a tax-free bonus of five billion rupiah ($380,000) for winning gold, as well as 20 million rupiah a month for the rest of their lives.
Indonesia pays the second-highest cash bonuses to its athletes who win Olympic gold, with only Singapore giving bigger payouts.
Also present at the welcoming ceremony were Indonesian weightlifters Sri Wahyuni and Eko Yuli Irawan, who both won silver in Rio. Indonesia won a total of three medals. AFP

South Africa, New Zealand Test wash out
DURBAN, TUESDAY: South African captain Faf du Plessis and New Zealand coach Mike Hesson both expressed disappointment after the first Test between South Africa and New Zealand was abandoned as a draw due to poor ground conditions on Tuesday.
No play was possible on days three, four and five because of a wet, soft outfield which the umpires decided would be dangerous for players.
No play took place after rain fell during the lunch break on the second day on Saturday, when New Zealand were on 15 for two in reply to South Africas first innings total of 263. Rain continued throughout the rest of Saturday and into early Sunday morning. The weather cleared and there was no further rain but the outfield conditions did not improve sufficiently for play to resume.
We were dying to get out there, said Du Plessis. New Zealand were in a spot of bother on a wicket which was giving a lot of assistance.
Despite that Du Plessis said that he respected the decision of the umpires.
There were areas that were muddy and loose underfoot. The message was clear from the umpires that the players safety was their main concern, he said. AFP
