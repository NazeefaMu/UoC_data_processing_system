AIUs warning saved Sumanthirans life: Warnasinghe
TNA Parliamentarian M. Sumanthiran should pay homage to the Security Forces and the Army Intelligence Unit(AIU) for revealing of a conspiracy to murder him, thus saving his life, Jathika Hela Urumaya (JHU) National Organiser and Western Provincial Councillor Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said.
Warnasinghe said so while addressing a media briefing at the JHU Headquarters yesterday. He added that many key ex-LTTE carders were released during the Rajapaksa regime. He said he was in doubt as to whether those carders were released in accordance with a hidden agenda of the Rajapaksa regime. He further said that the TNA members could live peacefully and act as they wished as a result of the sacrifice of the 26,000 security forces personnel during the three decade war on terrorism.
Unless TNA MPs do not stop political gambling, they too will be side-lined by the Tamil people themselves, he said. Warnasinghe further added that there should be no threat to the national security through foreign investments.

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that the investigation into the controversial MIG aircraft deal will expose the former Defence Secretary.
Dr. Senaratne said the former Defence Secretary was always depicted as a patriotic person and added that the country will come to know about his patriotism when the MIG probe comes to a conclusion. According to the minister, unlike during the previous regime, the present government investigates corruption and malpractices according to the law and action against culprits will be taken according to the law.
The President and the Prime Minister are conducting two separate investigations into the Central Bank bond issue and the culprits will be punished according to the law if proved guilty, he told a Suwasara Suwaundana mobile health camp in Galle.
Minister Dr. Senaratne pointed out that even though the people talk about the Rs. 10,000 million bond issue, the COPE has uncovered corruption amounting to Rs. 330,000 million during the previous regime.
He said although the current government had launched probes on the bond issue, the previous government did not do anything to investigate deals of massive corruption revealed during that time. The government is ready to face the 2020 election. Some recently spoke about the Navy Commander attacking a journalist but the previous Navy Commander made a youth disappear and no one spoke about it, he said. The Maha Sangha is saying that the COL is very high but no one remembers how this government gave relief to the people by increasing public servants salaries by Rs. 10,000, reducing the price of fuel by Rs. 48 and reducing the price of kerosene oil to Rs. 55.

Miss France crowned Miss Universe

Miss France was crowed Miss Universe today (30) in a made-for-television spectacle free of last year's dramatic mix-up but with a dash of political controversy as the finalists spoke out on the refugee crisis and other hot-button global issues.
Iris Mittenaere, a dental surgery student from Lille in the north of France, beat 85 of the world's most beautiful women at the event in the Philippines scheduled for primetime viewing in the United States.
Mittenaere, 24, edged out Miss Haiti, the first runner-up, and Miss Colombia the second runner-up.
In the final question round, Miss France highlighted the benefits of open borders when asked about the global refugee crisis.
"In France we want to have the most globalisation that we can. We want to have the biggest exchange of people that we can. Maybe someday that will change but now we have open borders," Mittenaere said.
"Having open borders allows us to travel more through the world and to find out more about what's out there in the world."
Miss Kenya, another finalist, said Donald Trump's presidency "may not have been the choice of many people" and divided the United States.
She also spoke out in support of former US president Barack Obama and said she backed Hillary Clinton to be America's first woman president.
"I feel once he took up his position, he was able to unify the entire nation," said Mary Esther Were, 27.
Miss Colombia appeared to allude to Trump when asked why violence was prevalent in the world.
"Although there are presidents who don't get along with others, we work together to unite. Campaigns, respect and inclusivity to be able to have a social transformation that would educate our children," said Andrea Tovar, 23.
Monday's show was headlined by US performers including Grammy award-winning rhythm and blues group Boyz II Men and rapper and Grammy award nominee Flo Rida.
Pia Wurtzbach of the Philippines won last year following a major blunder in which the host, Emmy Award winner Steve Harvey, mistakenly awarded the title to Miss Colombia.
Harvey corrected the error minutes later, apologising on air to Wurtzbach and Miss Colombia, Ariadna Gutierrez.
The mistake featured prominently on Monday's show, with candidates and the home audience often ribbing Harvey about it.
"Steve, I never got to thank you but thank you for making me the most popular Miss Universe," Wurtzbach told Harvey at the opening of show.
Harvey this year got through the closing moments of the ceremony smoothly.
The Philippines agreed to host the pageant as part of efforts to draw tourists and investors.
Beauty pageants are also hugely popular in the Philippines, particularly among the tens of millions of poor who see the contests as a chance for their beautiful compatriots to live a life of fame and luxury.
But allowing the Philippines to host has proved controversial, with critics claiming the pageant would whitewash Duterte's brutal drug war, which has left more than 6,000 people dead.
Environmentalists also hit out at pageant organisers for letting the bikini-clad contestants swim last month with endangered whale sharks.
Despite the controversies, excited fans from across the globe lined up before dawn to watch the pageant, which was held in the morning Manila time for the coveted prime American evening viewing audiences.
Fans dressed in evening gowns with a sash took selfies outside the seaside arena where the competition was held while others organised viewing parties in hotels and restaurants in the capital.

MR ought to have retired gracefully after two terms: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an obvious response to a statement made by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa yesterday, said that Rajapaksa too could have retired from politics gracefully after two terms if he did not bring the 18th amendment to the constitution.
Rajapaksa had told a rally in Nugegoda on Friday that although he had intended to retire from politics after the defeat at the last Presidential election,he had reversed the decision due to the continuing harassment against his family members.
President J.R.Jayewardene introduced the Executive Presidential system of government to enable a President to hold office for two terms and retire from politics. After President Jayewardene, President D.B. Wijetunga retired after a single term. President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga also retired after holding office for two terms, he said.
The Prime Minister said this addressing an awareness programme attended by UNP activists in the Anuradhapura district at the Anuradhapura Youth Resort auditorium.
Since former President Rajapaksa did not follow that tradition the opposition fielded a common candidate against him and the people defeated Rajapaksa and forced him into retirement, the Prime Minister said.
All attempts by opponents of this government to disrupt the countrys economy by resorting to strikes, protest campaigns and various other threats will be defeated at all costs, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister said Rajapaksa and his joint opposition clique which pledged to take over the reins of government in January had reneged on that pledge and were now saying that they did not want to do it but would wait and watch.
They later deceived the people saying several ministers and MPs of the good governance government would turn up at their Nugegoda rally. Let alone ministers and MPs not even a pradeshiya sabha member supporting the government turned up at the rally, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
President Rajapaksa had ruined the economy dashing the hopes of the people who expected an economic recovery after ending the war. He had no cure for the countrys economic ills at all and the country has to repay the debt burden imposed by the Rajapaksa regime till 2026, he said.
The government had the tact and ability to restore the countrys sagging economy left over by the former regime, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said.
The Prime Minister said the National Consensus government had two important duties to perform - one was ensure a good income to the people and the other to ensure a bright future for the young generation.
The Prime Minister said he has undertaken this responsibility as the Prime Minister of the National Unity Government and as the leader of the UNP.
The government is busy placing the economy on the correct track. Now it was ready to go forward by resolving the peoples burning problems, he said.
The Prime Minister said the government would set up industrial zones in other parts of the country as in Hambantota.
Youth from areas such as Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa would be able to seek employment in them. Steps would also be taken to set up an oil refinery and a Naval Dockyard in Hambantota, he said.
He said he did not know the earthly reason why Rajapaksa and his clique opposed these moves which would ensure a bright future for the people.
Giant development projects would be implemented in the Colombo City. The Port City project launched by the previous regime would be converted into a financial city. Giant industries would be launched in Wayamba too. A car assembly factory was opened in Kuliyapitiya. Another company had applied to start a car manufacturing plant in the country. When these projects come on line people would be able to purchase a vehicle at an easy price, the Prime Minister said.
The Eastern Coastal area would be developed as a Tourist Zone. Anuradhapura would be developed as the centre of the Cultural Triangle. The Moragahakanda Project had now been inaugurated. Thereafter the government would undertake the Malwathu Oya Project. Self - employment opportunities would also be made available at village level, he said.
The Prime Minister said he had not forgotten the torment UNP supporters underwent at the hands of the previous regime.
They would be looked after in the future and their problems including those relating to political victimisation would be resolved in due course. He said he had instructed the UNP General Secretary to give first preference to resolving problems of political victimisation relating to UNP supporters.
He said he had also instructed the UNP Chairman and General Secretary to reorganise the UNP into a powerful party so that anyone who tries to run riot and disrupt the countrys economic development and national unity will have to contend with a might of the UNP which would defeat such attempts with full force.

President summons Ranjan, Divulapitiya DS
Social Empowerment and Welfare Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake and the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretary have been summoned to the Presidential Secretariat today, to sort out an issue regarding illegal sand mining in the area. Deputy Minister Ramanayake told the media in Colombo yesterday that he too was asked by the President to attend the meeting to sort out the issue which was given wide publicity in the media.
The electronic media carried recent footage showing the Deputy Minister using strong words against the Divulapitiya DS.
Commenting on his intervention to stop illegal soil mining in Akaragama during which he had a heated argument with the Divisional Secretary, Ramanayake said that he would not apologize until soil mining and other environmentally harmful activities in the area are stopped.
The Deputy Minister charged that UPFA MP Indika Anuruddha, his father, bother and cousin bother are allegedly involved in illegal sand mining in the area.
The Divisional Secretary, being a public official,should have taken prompt action rather than asking me to come up with a written complaint. She is not suited to be in the public service if she cannot tolerate criticisms, he said.
The press briefing was organised in the wake of a protest organised by the Sri Lanka Administrative Service Association to mark its protest on the above incident.
Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake during the interaction with the press also charged that Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen should be held responsible for the alleged deforestation that took place near Wilpattu. Ramanayake said that he went on an inspection tour in Wilpattu on January 23 and he was convinced that there had been severe damage to forest cover.
The bitter truth is that the Sinhala community had been served with a small spoon and Muslim community had been served with a larger spoon in this area. The minister had helped a few Sinhala families in Wijayagama in the area. All ethnic groups and religions should be treated equal and this should be same in Wilpattu as well he said.
He also charged that there had been deforestation in about 26,000 acres in Sinharaja, but did not provide any detail on this claim stating he was gathering information.
Responding to a question by a journalist on the Treasury Bonds allegations, the Deputy Minister said that he was in a clear stand that the Perpetual Treasuries allegedly had earned undue profits from the bonds scam. I am not afraid to say this even though I could be removed from the party tomorrow. I was not part and parcel with the foot note faction he commented.

A farmer from Katuwawala, Maharagama, Upali Dayananda, had cultivated a rare paddy variety in his field, which produces more than two kilograms of paddy from a single plant. He had cultivated this special type of paddy variety in his home garden.
According to him, this paddy variety does not need to be cultivated in paddy fields, as it could be cultivated as usual on any ground as Goda Vee. Accordingly, this paddy variety could be categorised as Eal Vee as it does not need much water.
He said that he cultivated this paddy variety in his home garden after he received a few seeds from a friend engaged in the Archeology sector in Sigiriya, last September. He had used only organic fertiliser for this cultivation, he said. He said that a paddy plant grew up to a height of 10 feet.

Sri Lanka signs declarations to manage temporary labour contractual agreements

The fourth Abu Dhabi Dialogue Consultative Ministerial Meeting in Colombo, Sri Lanka, has announced four declarations as per The Colombo Declaration Draft, which acts as a collaborative agenda for the next two-year cycle, 2017  2018, tackling projects and initiatives relating to temporary labour contracts between 'countries of origin and destination' in Asia.
"The cooperation aims to enhance the outcomes of temporary contract employment in our region and improve the quality of the lives of workers and their families, leveraging the credibility that the Abu Dhabi Dialogue process enjoys today at regional and international levels and the respect and support it receives from various international organisations," according to the Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, MoHRE.
The declarations were issued at the conclusion of the meeting, which was held recently with the participation of Saqr Ghobash, Minister of Human Resources and Emiratisation, alongside other ministers of labour and participating member delegations from, Afghanistan, Bahrain, Bangladesh, India, Indonesia, Kuwait, Malaysia, Nepal, Oman and Pakistan, the Philippines, Qatar, Saudi Arabia, Sri Lanka, Thailand and Vietnam.
The first declaration tackled issues related to labour recruitment, as practices associated with the contract workers in the regions corridors continue to represent a challenge and to compromise shared goal of fair and equitable governance of labour mobility. The meeting declared to lend priority to regional cooperation aimed at promoting lawful, fair and transparent labour recruitment practices and further empowering member governments to scrutinise and prevent unlawful practices and to hold to account any and all non-compliant actors in recruitment processes.
On skill certification and mutual recognition, the board recognised that training and skill development have become essential, both as an imperative for successful national employment policies in Asian countries of origin and to accommodate the growing need for skilled workers in the GCCs transition to knowledge economies.
The declaration sheds light on the use of technology to facilitate and improve the outcomes of labour mobility in Asia, following the increased use of technology and digital platforms by member states in administering labour mobility, as well as the development and deployment of successfully shared platforms by pairs of ADD governments, notably the Musanid platform developed by Saudi Arabia and jointly implemented by the Kingdom with Bangladesh and other member states.
The declaration advocates global consultations on the adoption of a Global Compact on Safe, Orderly and Regular Migration, especially in reference to the large labour mobility flows in the Asia-GCC corridors and the immense contribution the mobility of temporary contract workers has made and is expected to continue to make to the development of countries of origin and destination alike.
In 2008, the UAE took the groundbreaking step of hosting an inaugural Ministerial Consultation in Abu Dhabi of Asian destination countries with the Colombo Process states on the theme of, "Contractual Labour Mobility in Asia: Key Partnerships for Development between Countries of Origin and Destination".
The meeting highlighted the potential of contractual labour mobility to benefit overseas workers as well as the development of both countries of origin and destination in Asia.
This Ministerial Meeting brought together for the first time the Colombo Process states with the GCC states, plus Yemen and two additional Asian countries of destination, Malaysia and Singapore, in the first meeting of the "Abu Dhabi Dialogue".

Transparency International Sri Lanka Executive Director Asoka Obeyesekere said yesterday that a news item which had appeared in the Daily News dated 27.01.2017 under the title Dept.Probes TISL official working sans valid Visa carried misleading statements against the TISL.
In response to the above allegation, we would like to state that our reporter has quoted both the immigration officials and the Executive Director of the TISL and the report is self explanatory.
However, herewith we also carry the full letter sent to us by the TISL.
Further to your article titled 'Dept. probes TISL official working sans valid visa' on the Daily News front page dated January 27, 2017, we wish to place on record our disappointment that the Daily News has titled the article with a claim that the TISL official was working without a valid visa.
Having provided the relevant law for your reference, Gazette 10/896 of 23 February 1956 (under the Immigrants and Emigrants Act), which demonstrates the ability for a holder of a residence visa to work in Sri Lanka, it would appear that the Daily News headline has sought to create an impression of fault on the part of Transparency International Sri Lanka whilst the organisation has worked within the letter and spirit of the law.
In carrying this grossly inaccurate title the Daily News is supporting a non-legal basis having a greater weight over that which is firmly grounded in the law (see gazette references above). We would therefore expect a front page correction to rectify this inaccuracy.

Trumps Executive Order on Refugees  Separating Fact from Hysteria

The hysterical rhetoric about President Trumps executive order on refugees is out of control. Lets slow down and take a look at the facts. To read the online commentary, one would think that President Trump just fundamentally corrupted the American character. You would think that the executive order on refugees he signed yesterday betrayed Americas founding ideals. You might even think he banned people from an entire faith from American shores.
Just look at the rhetoric. Heres Chuck Schumer:
If you thought only Senator Schumer saw tears in Lady Libertys eyes, think again. Heres Nancy Pelosi:
CNN, doing its best Huffington Post impersonation, ran a headline declaring Trump bans 134,000,000 from the U.S. The Huffington Post, outdoing itself, just put the Statue of Liberty upside down on its front page. So, what did Trump do Did he implement his promised Muslim ban No, far from it. He backed down dramatically from his campaign promises and instead signed an executive order dominated mainly by moderate refugee restrictions and temporary provisions aimed directly at limiting immigration from jihadist conflict zones. 
Lets analyze the key provisions, separate the fact from the hysteria, and introduce just a bit of historical perspective. 
First, the order temporarily halts refugee admissions for 120 days to improve the vetting process, then caps refugee admissions at 50,000 per year. Outrageous, right Not so fast. Before 2016, when Obama dramatically ramped up refugee admissions, Trumps 50,000 stands roughly in between a typical year of refugee admissions in George W. Bushs two terms and a typical year in Obamas two terms. 
The chart below, from the Migration Policy Institute, is instructive:
In 2002, the United States admitted only 27,131 refugees. It admitted fewer than 50,000 in 2003, 2006, and 2007. As for President Obama, he was slightly more generous than President Bush, but his refugee cap from 2013 to 2015 was a mere 70,000, and in 2011 and 2012 he admitted barely more than 50,000 refugees himself. 
The bottom line is that Trump is improving security screening and intends to admit refugees at close to the average rate of the 15 years before Obamas dramatic expansion in 2016. Obamas expansion was a departure from recent norms, not Trumps contraction. Second, the order imposes a temporary, 90-day ban on people entering the U.S. from Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen. These are countries either torn apart by jihadist violence or under the control of hostile, jihadist governments. 
The ban is in place while the Department of Homeland Security determines the information needed from any country to adjudicate any visa, admission, or other benefit under the INA (adjudications) in order to determine that the individual seeking the benefit is who the individual claims to be and is not a security or public-safety threat. It could, however, be extended or expanded depending on whether countries are capable of providing the requested information. 
The ban, however, contains an important exception: Secretaries of State and Homeland Security may, on a case-by-case basis, and when in the national interest, issue visas or other immigration benefits to nationals of countries for which visas and benefits are otherwise blocked. In other words, the secretaries can make exceptions  a provision that would, one hopes, fully allow interpreters and other proven allies to enter the U.S. during the 90-day period. To the extent this ban applies to new immigrant and non-immigrant entry, this temporary halt (with exceptions) is wise. 
We know that terrorists are trying to infiltrate the ranks of refugees and other visitors. We know that immigrants from Somalia, for example, have launched jihadist attacks here at home and have sought to leave the U.S. to join ISIS. Indeed, given the terrible recent track record of completed and attempted terror attacks by Muslim immigrants, its clear that our current approach is inadequate to control the threat. Unless we want to simply accept Muslim immigrant terror as a fact of American life, a short-term ban on entry from problematic countries combined with a systematic review of our security procedures is both reasonable and prudent. However, there are reports that the ban is being applied even to green-card holders. This is madness. The plain language of the order doesnt apply to legal permanent residents of the U.S., and green-card holders have been through round after round of vetting and security checks. The administration should intervene, immediately, to stop misapplication. If, however, the Trump administration continues to apply the order to legal permanent residents, it should indeed be condemned.
Third, Trumps order also puts an indefinite hold on admission of Syrian refugees to the United States until such time as I have determined that sufficient changes have been made to the USRAP to ensure that admission of Syrian refugees is consistent with the national interest. This is perhaps the least consequential aspect of his order  and is largely a return to the Obama administrations practices from 2011 to 2014. For all the Democrats wailing and gnashing of teeth, until 2016 the Obama administration had already largely slammed the door on Syrian-refugee admissions. The Syrian Civil War touched off in 2011. Here are the Syrian-refugee admissions to the U.S. until Obama decided to admit more than 13,000 in 2016: 
Fiscal Year 2011: 
29 Fiscal Year 2012: 
31 Fiscal Year 2013: 
36 Fiscal Year 2014: 
105 Fiscal Year 2015: 
1,682 To recap:While the Syrian Civil War was raging, ISIS was rising, and refugees were swamping Syrias neighbors and surging into Europe, the Obama administration let in less than a trickle of refugees. Only in the closing days of his administration did President Obama reverse course  in numbers insufficient to make a dent in the overall crisis, by the way  and now the Democrats have the audacity to tweet out pictures of bleeding Syrian children Its particularly gross to see this display when the Obama administrations deliberate decision to leave a yawning power vacuum  in part through its Iraq withdrawal and in part through its dithering throughout the Syrian Civil War  exacerbated the refugee crisis in the first place. 
There was a genocide on Obamas watch, and his tiny trickle of Syrian refugees hardly makes up for the grotesque negligence of abandoning Iraq and his years-long mishandling of the emerging Syrian crisis. When we know our enemy is seeking to strike America and its allies through the refugee population, when we know theyve succeeded in Europe, and when the administration has doubts about our ability to adequately vet the refugees we admit into this nation, a pause is again not just prudent but arguably necessary. It is important that we provide sufficient aid and protection to keep refugees safe and healthy in place, but it is not necessary to bring Syrians to the United States to fulfill our vital moral obligations. Fourth, there is a puzzling amount of outrage over Trumps directive to prioritize refugee claims made by individuals on the basis of religious-based persecution, provided that the religion of the individual is a minority religion in the individuals country of nationality. In other words, once refugee admissions resume, members of minority religions may well go to the front of the line. In some countries, this means Christians and Yazidis. In others, it can well mean Muslims. 
Sadly, during the Obama administration it seems that Christians and other minorities may well have ended up in the back of the line. For example, when Obama dramatically expanded Syrian refugee admissions in 2016, few Christians made the cut: The Obama administration has resettled 13,210 Syrian refugees into the United States since the beginning of 2016  an increase of 675 percent over the same 10-month period in 2015. Of those, 13,100 (99.1 percent) are Muslims  12,966 Sunnis, 24 Shia, and 110 other Muslims  and 77 (0.5 percent) are Christians. Another 24 (0.18 percent) are Yazidis. 
As a point of reference, in 2015 Christians represented roughly 10 percent of Syrias population. Perhaps theres an innocent explanation for the disparity. Perhaps not. But one thing is clear  federal asylum and refugee law already require a religious test. As my colleague Andy McCarthy has repeatedly pointed out, an alien seeking asylum must establish that...religion [among other things]...was or will be at least one central reason for persecuting the applicant. Similarly, the term refugee means (A) any person who is outside any country of such persons nationality...and who is unable or unwilling to return to...that country because of persecution or a well-founded fear of persecution on account of...religion [among other things]...[.]
But dont tell CNNs chief national security correspondent, who last night tweeted this:

False. False. False. Religious considerations are by law part of refugee policy. And it is entirely reasonable to give preference (though not exclusivity) to members of minority religions. Finally, you can read the entire executive order from start to finish, reread it, then read it again, and you will not find a Muslim ban. Its not there. Nowhere. At its most draconian, it temporarily halts entry from jihadist regions. In other words, Trumps executive order is a dramatic climb-down from his worst campaign rhetoric.
To be sure, however, the ban is deeply problematic as applied to legal residents of the U.S. and to interpreters and other allies seeking refuge in the United States after demonstrated (and courageous) service to the United States. Twitter timelines are coming alive with stories of Iraqi interpreters whove saved American lives. Few have bled more in alliance with America than Iraqs Kurds, but the order itself provides for the necessary case-by-case exemptions to the temporary blanket bans. It is vital that General John Kelly, the newly confirmed secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, move expeditiously to protect those whove laid down their lives in the war against ISIS, al-Qaeda, and the Taliban. Given his own wartime experience, I believe and hope that he will. 
Trumps order was not signed in a vacuum. Look at the Heritage Foundations interactive timeline of Islamist terror plots since 9/11. Note the dramatic increase in planned and executed attacks since 2015. Now is not the time for complacency. Now is the time to take a fresh look at our border-control and immigration policies. Trumps order isnt a betrayal of American values. Applied correctly and competently, it can represent a promising fresh start and a prelude to new policies that protect our nation while still maintaining American compassion and preserving American friendships.

Trump executive order: White House stands firm over travel ban

The Trump administration is standing firm over its ban on immigration from seven countries despite court rulings and mass protests against it.
In a statement, President Trump said visas would once again be issued once "the most secure policies" were in place, and denied it was a Muslim ban.
The move has been widely condemned.
Sixteen state attorneys general have said the order is unconstitutional. Several federal judges have temporarily halted the deportation of visa holders.
Trump'sexecutive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries.
Those who were already mid-flight were detained on arrival - even if they held valid US visas or other immigration permits. It is not known how many others were turned away at airports overseas as they tried to board flights to the US.
Thousands gathered at airports around the country to protest on Saturday, including lawyers who offered their services for free to those affected.
Further demonstrations were held on Sunday, including protests outside the White House and Trump Tower in New York.
Who is affected by the ban
As well as the ban on all refugees, travellers who have nationality or dual nationality of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen are not permitted to enter the US for 90 days, or be issued an immigrant or non-immigrant visa.
This includes those who share dual nationality with allied countries,including the UK, although Canada has been told its dual nationals are not affected.
But there remains much confusion.
The UK foreign officeput out a statementsaying that only those dual nationals travelling from one of the blacklisted seven countries would be subject to extra checks - those travelling between the UK and US would not be affected.
However, one Scottish veterinary student - who travels on an Iranian passport - wasunable to fly home from her holiday in Costa Ricabecause she was told her transit visa for the US was no longer valid.
White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus said US green-card holders - legal residents - would also not be affected, but some have been detained since the order came into effect.
What does the White House say
Trumptweetedearly on Sunday that the US needed "extreme vetting, NOW" but later, in a statement, tried to offer more reassuring words, saying: "This is not about religion - this is about terror and keeping our country safe.
"We will again be issuing visas to all countries once we are sure we have reviewed and implemented the most secure policies over the next 90 days," he said.
Priebus rejected criticism that the implementation of the order had been chaotic, and said only 109 people, out of 325,000 travelling, had been detained and "most of those people were moved out".
"We've got a couple of dozen more that remain and I would suspect that as long as they're not awful people that they will move through before another half a day today," he told US media on Sunday.
But they have failed to allay concern among some in their Republican party. The Republican chair of the US Senate Foreign Relations committee, Senator Bob Corker, said the executive order had been "poorly implemented", particularly for green-card holders, and the "administration should make appropriate revisions".
Democratic Senate Minority leader Chuck Schumer said the US now appeared "less humanitarian, less safe, less American" and said the Democrats would introduce legislation to overturn it.
Ali worked for three years as an interpreter for the US Army and gained admittance to the US through a Special Immigrant Visa. He now has a green card, and returned to Iraq for his father's funeral, only to be delayed for hours for questioning at Dulles.
"We are not terrorists. We are not bad people," said Ali. "It's so hard. I hope they will change their minds on this position."
Legal minds have their say
In a joint statement, 16 attorneys general, from states including California, New York and Pennsylvania, said they would "use all of the tools of our offices to fight this unconstitutional order" and, until it was struck down, would "work to ensure that as few people as possible suffer from the chaotic situation that it has created".
Late on Saturday, federal Judge Ann Donnelly, in New York, ruled against the removal from the US of people with approved refugee applications, valid visas, and "other individuals... legally authorised to enter the United States".
She was ruling on a case brought on behalf of two Iraqi men with links to the US military who were detained at JFK Airport in New York, who were later released.
Countries react with alarm
Criticism of Trump's decision has been growing louder outside the US.
Canada is offering temporary residence to those stranded there because of the US order, the immigration minister said. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau earlier tweeted that Canadawelcomed"those fleeing persecution, terror and war".
Iran is threatening a reciprocal ban on US citizens entering the country. Similar comments came out of Iraq, with whom the US is working to drive IS out of Mosul.
Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany said "even the necessary, determined fight against terrorism does not justify placing people of a certain origin or belief under general suspicion".
A spokesperson for UK Prime Minister Theresa May saidshe "did not agree"with the restrictions, and French independent presidential candidate Emmanuel Macron tweeted: "I stand with the people fleeing war and persecution."

Unite to develop the country, says President
All must get together to develop the country and not compete with each other for political gains, President Maithripala Sirisena said. The President made these comments at the inauguration ceremony of the proposed Kumbukkan Oya Water Project in Kumbukkana, Moneragala on Saturday. President Sirisena said some power hungry elements are attempting to come to power.
"No one can topple this government until 2020," he said. The President said 2017 is acclaimed as the year of alleviating poverty and bringing sustainable development throughout the country in the fields of agriculture, irrigation, health, education and infrastructure.
President Sirisena who said Moneragala was affected by poverty, malnutrition and water scarcity stressed on the need to launch various projects in the district.
He also praised the annual paddy production and the forest density of the Moneragala district which is high compared to other districts. The President said with the completion of this project about 200 families are to be resettled.
Yet under Kotmale, Victoria, Mahaweli and Moragahakanda projects thousands of families were resettled then. The government is ready to provide infrastructure facilities to the people to be resettled under the Kumbukkan Oya Project, he said.
President Sirisena said the prevailing drought is a natural phenomenon that we experience once in four years. We should acclimatise to the climatic changes by changing our cultivation systems to face future challenges, he said. The President praised the services of government officials, politicians and others to provide relief to the public affected by the drought. The government has earmarked Rs. 31,152 million for this project which will benefit people in Buttala, Moneragala and Siyabalanduwa. The implementation of this project enables to establish two separate electricity power stations (16 Giga Watt annually to the national grid), provide drinking water, cultivate 10,315 acres of new land and supply water to 3,100 acres to existing lands.
Irrigation and Water resource Management Minister Vijamuni Zoysa , Management and Public Administration Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Sustainable Development and Wildlife Deputy Minister Sumedha G. Jayasena also spoke. Uva Provincial Governor, Provincial Council ministers, Moneragala District Secretary D. S. Padmakulasuriya and other dignitaries also participated.
