Meethotamulla culprits still not brought to book
No legal action has been taken against the culprits responsible for the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapse as of yet, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champaka Ranawaka said yesterday.
The minister was addressing an event organised by the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation and Development Corporation (SLLRDC) at the Nelum Pokuna Theater, yesterday. Minister Ranawaka also said that this unfortunate delay occurs in a background where the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Meethotamulla disaster had already handed over its report. He added that the report includes recommendations against five government institutions and persons who were directly responsible for the lives claimed at the collapse. Minister Ranawaka added that such a delay in justice shows the government in a bad light.
He further said the core values of good governance is lost if the government cannot bring the culprits of the Meethotamulla disaster to book. Minister Ranawaka said such a delay is a more serious wrongdoing than dumping garbage and that it is an insult to the victims of that man-made disaster. Minister Ranawaka said the main development challenge in the country was water management and added that one part of the country suffers from drought, while the other part suffers from floods. Thus, he said there needs to be a project that would manage excess water and carry it to drought-stricken areas. He added that a basic strategic plan to manage floods is being drafted at present.

Reconciliation need of the hour
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday stated that incidents such as the one in Ampara on Monday were detrimental to the reconciliation process of the country.
The President said that such incidents stand as challenges to the governments reconcilliation programme.
While we launch the Sri Lanka National Policy on Reconciliation and Co-existance, we have to overcome these kinds of challenges in the process of reconciliation, President Sirisena said.
President Sirisena was speaking at the launch of the National Policy on Reconciliation and Co-Existence Sri Lanka and the premiere of the film Thundenek at the Regal Cinema yesterday.
The President also stated under such circumstances, we have to commit ourselves and work hard to bringing about reconciliation and co-existence.
But those who attempt to do good are mostly treated in a disdainful manner, the President said. This is the lesson espoused by our religious leaders as well.
President Sirisena also said that the government had done a great deal of work during the last three years to bring about reconciliation in the country.
He added that the reconciliation process is a moral vision and it is very hard to inculcate this in the minds of certain people who work according to their personal agenda.
The President added that the launch of the National Policy was historic since the progress of a project lies behind policies, planning and enactment.
President Sirisena also appreciated the commitment of former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in her capacity as the Chairpersom of the Office for National Unity and Reconcilliation to adopt Sri Lankas first National Policy on Reconcilliation.
The Film Thundenek which is co-directed by Prasanna Vithanage, Vimukthi Jayasindara and Ashoka Handagama on the theme of reconciliation and co-existence had its premiere following the launch of the Sri Lanka National Policy on Reconcilliation and Co-Existance.
Copies of the National Policy were presented to the President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe by Office for National Unity and Reconciliation Director General M.S. Jayasinghe.

SL coop assets close to Rs 3 bn
The asset base of Sri Lankan cooperatives have increased to nearly Rs three billion (US $ 18 million)-and coops are no longer charitable but they too should now compete in the liberal market economy.
Cooperatives are no longer charitable organizations and they have to compete with other institutions in a liberalized market economy. Accordingly, Cooperatives may formulate proper strategic plans to sell their products and services, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen addressing the launch of Asia Pacific Cooperative Development Conference by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) at Galadari Hotel Colombo.
This is the first ever such ICA Conference to be held in Sri Lanka with over cooperative reps from 27 countries.
The two day sessions that conclude on February 29 shall be focusing on integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to cooperative systems.
This series of ICA sub-regional conferences began last year with three already concluded (In Jordan for Central Asia, in Mongolia for East Asia, and in Philippine for South East Asia).
It is obvious that this conference has paid its attention to Socio-economic, cultural well-being, poverty, hunger, food conservation, environment conservation etc. The recommendations, proposals and conclusions of this conference could be implemented through the cooperative movement and be contributed to the sustainability in the region. Global Co-operative movement will also find out ways and means to achieve SDGs through this largest Community based movement in the world, said Minister Bathiudeen.
There are almost 14,500 cooperatives in various productions, services, SMEs, womens development, rural banking, insurance and farming sectors. Cooperatives are also now present in our FMCG retail sector in Sri Lanka through Coop City shops.
Lankan cooperative assets are a huge $1.8 billion with another dollar one billion in savings. The membership in our cooperative system exceeds five million.
This conference brings together participants of previous three sub-regional conferences. This meeting is held with the support of the European Union. Discussions and presentations will take place in the coming two days on eradicating poverty, sustainable food system, improving access and protecting environment. Regional Director of Asia Pacific Region of the International Cooperative Alliance Balu Iyer said.

144 Years at  Wesley
Wesley College is named after John Wesley (1703-1791) the founder of the Methodist Church. An Oxford graduate, he was one of the greatest evangelists in the history of the Christian Church. A preacher of great power and an organizer of genius, he founded Methodism in the face of intense opposition and laid the foundations of future world-wide expansion.
Wesley College began its existence in the Dam street Pettah and was founded by Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira on March 2, 1874. He became its first Vice-Principal during the Principalship of Rev. Samuel Rowse Wilkin. During the early days, Pettah was a respectable residential area and its streets were lined with tall trees. The school had its beginnings on the verandahs of the old Methodist Church at Dam Street, Pettah. The Pettah merchants of mixed races and religions educated their children at this school Wesley. Daniel Henry Pereira was much loved by the people and his pupils. He laboured thus for years in the dust and the heat of Pettah.
Keen interest
When Rev. Highfield arrived in 1895 Pettah was rapidly becoming a busy area and he saw the need for peaceful surroundings for his school, with space to expand. He was the person who moved Wesley College to its present site in 1905. Young Daniel Henry Highfield was keenly interested in teaching. He was a specialist in Biology and also a keen scientist. He was also proficient in English, Sinhala and Portuguese languages. In his parish work, he served in many stations for over 25 years. When he fell ill, his work was taken over by Rev. Robert Hardy. Wesley commemorates the memory of her founder, Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira annually on Founders Day March 2. This is the most important event in the Schools calendar. A three-storied imposing building dedicated to his memory, D H Pereira Memorial Building to accommodate the junior school, was constructed during the Principalship of Dunstan Fernando. No doubt the labours of Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira servant of God, has nurtured a rich crop of students who have served our Motherland; no doubt this harvest will be reaped by generations yet unborn.
Rev. Henry Highfield is to Wesley what Theseus is to Greece. His legend is everywhere spurred on by his missionary zeal and love for humanity. He collected the money to build the school in its present site. Today as we recall and honour these two great personalities of Wesley we bring into focus the school which they dreamt of-where the motto is PRAY AND LABOUR ON, truly they have laboured Sri Lanka one of its best and greatest schools.
The College Crest
Crest which has adorned student record books, uniforms and blazers of Wesley College, consist of the cross and the shells derived from the coat of arms of John Wesley, on the other hand the origin of the shield on the crest is not known, as it is not featured even in any of the designs of the college .
The motto ORA ET LABORA which is an integral part of the crest was inserted by Rev. Arthur Shipham (1880-1883) and John Dalby. The 12 shells are symbolic of the journeying pilgrim, seeking and searching ahead. One could even compare it to the twelve wandering tribes of Israel. Within the shield of faith is placed the rugged cross of sacrifice.
College Song
The college song has been composed by a renowned old Wesleyite, H J V I Ekanayake. Boys of Wesley Through the Land was first sung after a farewell dinner to a junior master held at the college hall in Dam Street, the first location of Wesley College. To mention with pride this was the 1st college song to be composed and sung in a school in Sri Lanka.
The great hall of Wesley College is a perfect tribute to Rev Henry Highfield. The hall has survived 2 world wars. The ion beam of the hall is made of the finest Burma Teak and is the only one of its kind in Sri Lanka. The majestic English Victorian stained glass windows are of the finest.
College Chapel
14th February 1993 Rev. Dr Kinsley Muttiah the President of the Methodist Church Sri Lanka who had laid the foundation stone declared it open and blessed while the Bishop of Colombo Rt. Rev. Kenneth Fernando preached the 1st sermon.
The college library is part of this extension and was named after Rev. Cartman. It now stands as a monument of honour for his selfless and determined work at Wesley. The library was declared open by the then Prime Minister D S Senanayake on 8th July 1949. In 1955 a full-time senior librarian was appointed for the 1st time to work during school hours.
On March 2, 2011, Principal Dr Shanthi Mclelland announced at the founders day assembly that on Founders Day 2012 Wesley will have a Swimming Pool. Many wesleyites thought that this was an unrealistic and impossible task. The Principal led the old boys and teachers to the pool site, which was the existing playground for the younger kids adjacent to Karlshue Gardens.
Old Boys Union
Tradition has it that the Old Boys Union of the school was inaugurated on the 1st December 1874, which is the year as that in which the school was founded. This may appear strange, but it can be explained by the fact that when Wesley College was opened, it took students from Pettah Methodist School. The Methodist church is well known as pioneers in the idea of involving all its members in church activities, and it is possible that this idea was extended to students in relation to school activities, it could surmise that the principal, Rev S R Wilkin who was the first principal of Wesley college would have conceived the idea of summoning a meeting of the students who left in the first year to form an Old Boys Union
WESLEY COLLEGE OBU CELEBRATES FOUNDERS DAY WEEK
HERBERT PERERA
Wesley commemorates the memory of her Founder, the Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira, annually on Founders Day. This is the most important event in the Schools calendar. During the Schools 144 years history, thousands have passed through the hallowed portals of this great institution, which has produced many Distinguished Alumni, who have contributed invaluable service to Society, Nation and the world. Among them are Sir Oliver Ernest Goonetilleke (the first Ceylonese Governor General), Sir Don Baron Jayatilaka, Sir Claude Corea (Member of Parliament), Walisinghe Harischandra (Social Reformer, Historian and Author), Sir Mohamed Macan Markar (Member Legislative Council of Ceylon), Sir Gerard Wijeyekoon (Member Legislative Council of Ceylon), Mahadevan Sathasivam (International Cricket Player), P de S Kularatne (Principal of Ananda College), E F C Ludowyk (first Professor of English at University of Ceylon), M H Mohamed (Speaker of Sri Lanka Parliament and Mayor of Colombo) and Farveez Maharoof (International Cricket Player).
The examples set by many brilliant Old Boys as Role Models who have lived up to the ideals and values of the Founders, bringing honour and glory to their Alma Mater through their respective professions, will continue to inspire Wesleyites in the years to come. The Current Committee of the Wesley College OBU Colombo, under the leadership of the Incumbent President Wilhelm Van Dort, is striving to uphold the Traditions and Values of the great Christian Methodist Legacy - which they inherited from preceding generations, and see that it is passed down to the future generations of Wesleyites.
The Founders Week celebrations on March 2, 3 and 4 are certainly going to bring nostalgic memories and re-kindle friendships among the Double Blue Fraternity. On March 2, the Past and Present Hockey and Soccer Matches will be held at Campbell Park at 4.30 pm, followed by the Traditional Principals Tea Party in the Pavillion. Thereafter the Water Polo match between the Past and Present students will be at 7.30 pm in the College pool.
On March 3, once again the Past and Present Students will play a Basketball match in the school premises, and the Traditional Cricket Match between the Old Boys and the 1st XI Cricket Team will follow at 9.30am at Campbell Park.

AAT Sri Lanka shows winning path with pending A/L examination
AAT Sri Lanka is one of the most sought after professional courses to which registrations are accepted with pending O/L results. The qualification paves the path to students to sit for their A/L examination with more confidence and be equipped with a vast knowledge which definitely is an advantage to cross the A/L hurdle with flying colours.
According to AAT Sri Lanka CEO Tishanga Kumarasingha, fifty three top places out of the Best 100 in the island including six places among the top ten had been achieved by AAT students, while the district first places of twelve districts also had been achieved by AAT students.
He further stated that, the main reason behind these victories is that the AAT scope of study goes so parallel with the A/L subject stream while providing opportunities for the students to revise the difficult subject matters over and over again until they get firm on it. It has been evident through the results of other professional examinations as well, that AAT passed finalists, after getting stage and subject exemptions from these institutes, perform exceptionally well, incurring a relatively less investment in money and time as well. what we have observed throughout these years is that those who finish AAT qualification even before they sit for their A/L examinations, are ahead of other students who actually wait till the A/L finishes to start their professional education journey, stated the CEO.
Registrations are open for July 2018 examinations of AAT, he also wished to remind all students who wish to achieve more in their lives to join the next crew of true achievers with AAT.

Against Adversity
For Head Girl of Highlands Ranudi Perera it was always going to be her heart. Perfect Prefects features Perera who claims her leadership is based on kindness and empathy.
Perera possesses an attribute that is not fully understood by science  and that is kindness. It is at once more compelling than intelligence or courage. It is not easy for a good man to lead. But Perera manages it. And in this world we live in, that is a rare quality.
I feel that one attribute that stands out about my leadership is my kindness. I believe in treating those under me in a very humane way with a lot of understanding and compassion. I would like to be an example of kindness to my fellow students. My ambition is to be a teacher. For this I would like to do well in my studies and go to university, explained Perera.
Firm kindness
As mentioned by her Head Boy Seniru Epasinghe she too believes in Unity. But while Epasinghe looks at unity in terms of standing against adversity, Perera looks at unity as a matter of the heart  being united by kindness. However this is not to say that she allows indiscipline. She is firm when she needs to be firm.
We must work together, have unity and coordination. Also the ability to control others is an important part of my leadership. Yes I am kind but I am not soft, said Perera.
When facing a difficult situation Ranudi says she would take advice from her teachers and the prefects board and then follow their advice. Because she feels that in addition to leading a student population she still needs to take directions and instructions. While being a leader she is still a follower.
I would say that in Sri Lanka, what I see as a big problem is a lack of unity. I think helping each other is an essential part of a well- organized society. This kind of culture of giving and helping is something I would like to promote. I think respecting others is very important to ensure security and order. I dont believe in condemning others and judging them. I believe we should work together, pointed out Perera.
Perera is part of the Media Club. The club has done wonders for her self- confidence. As she got used to being exposed to the outside world she lost this fear of expressing herself. She soon became a shepherdess to the young ones who came into the media club.
Reprimanding someone
First I need to thank my parents for where I am today. I must also thank my teachers right throughout my education from the nursery. They taught me how to grow up and how to become well- disciplined young lady, added Perera.
Pereras message to anyone who wants to be a leader is to choose their words carefully and wisely in a way that does not lacerate anyones feelings. She does not believe in hurting anyones feelings. Even when reprimanding someone there is a way to put ideas across. Scolding a person is something she likes to avoid.
First you should speak to someone kindly. Do not fight and advise them kindly and lovingly. And I believe they will then listen to us. Because we all like to be loved and we dont like to be at the receiving end of negative criticism, said Perera.
Perera says she is not someone who becomes affected by pressure. If she is in a tense situation she just detaches herself from it and tries to be calm.
The education I have received from the Highlands is very good. Our teachers are always available and always have an ear. They are there for us anytime during school. They would go out of their way to help us. They help us in many ways to succeed in life, stated Perera.
Disrepute and disgrace
One of the most important parts of Pereras leadership is inculcating a love for the school in students, because they all have a lot that they owe to the Highlands. They have received much from the school in terms of education and it has become a platform for them.
Do not bring the school into disrepute and disgrace by behaving badly in public. Always think of other people. Always be a role model to others, said Perera.
Perera feels that one problem in the world that she sees is aggressive, unethical and uncalled for behavior. Behavior that is undesirable. Behavior that is unreasonable or irrational. We see this a lot in society. Husbands abusing their wives, wives also abusing their husbands, children being abused. Violence in society, work place harassment and many more.
There is a great need to understand others. I became a head girl because teachers understood me and helped me. They told me as a girl in this day and age you need to be well-disciplined. A girl has to protect her name and reputation. Her character is important and she must value her character, explained Perera.
The temple is a sanctuary for Perera. As a Buddhist she meditates and calms her mind. Her source of strength is her parents. She has a very open relationship with her parents and they are always there for her.
Climbing hills
School is a place that has meant a lot to her. As a teacher I can give back to society. As a teacher I would like to share my experiences with the students. Because I really enjoy my schooling years. It is a part of me that I will never let go. I do a lot of activities related to nature  such as climbing hills and mountains. I love the rainforests, she explained.
Despite her naturally giving character she does not believe in trusting everyone. Even though we are faithful others may not be the same. So we need to be a little cautious.
I am lucky to have a guild that is very intelligent. I do not have to go after them, they do things on their own. I dont need to remind them all the time. I have got into the habit of balancing school and family. I manage my time. I enjoy my time with my family and friends, said Perera.

Highlands College has offered Head Boy Seniru Epasinghe an arena for development. Perfect Prefects features Epasinghe who with the school behind him is ready to begin his life journey.
First and foremost Epasinghe needs to be a role model to others, if he is to exercise the powers of his office to the fullest.
Because if I am not a role model then I cannot win people over and get them to work with me. I understand that sports and other extra-curricular activities as well as studies are important for the development of the personality of a student. I encourage them to engage in such activities. I need to motivate others to perform their duties, because the Head Girl and I reply on a properly functioning system of command which ensures discipline in the school said Epasinghe.
His goal in life is to be a software engineer. This goal is largely altruistic since he wishes to be one, so he can help others in their day to day activities.
I believe in Unity. No matter how desperate the situation is or the odds stacked against me are, I knows that my guild will stand by my side and I will stand with my guild. That is the quality of my leadership. We will stand in unison when it comes to any activity at school. I understand my success depends on the loyalty and respect my underlings have for me, explained Epasinghe.
He knows his prefects are young. And that once they leave the portals of Highland they will have to face the world. It is vital that they look up to him for this reason alone. He needs to guide them and prepare them. His character must be without blemish and his behavior needs to exemplary.
I will tackle the problem alone if it is within my power. If the problem is something that is severe I will seek counsel from my parents and teachers. But always on my mind is the team. That is my first resort. They are comfortable taking orders from me and treat me as more of a mentor. I have trained and directed my guild, as to what to do when encountering a difficulty, said Epasinghe
Money is not everything for young Epasinghe. His business is being a fisher of men. The abilities of an individual is what greatly interests him. What is his primary concern is what that individual can choose to do. Money is this mans least concern.
He is a chess player at heart because he is a strategist and a footballer because it is a team game.
I am someone who pursues football and chess at school. I believes in a cordial relationship with others when it comes to working as a team. Again comes the Unity aspect. The relationships are what matters. I am working with humans not robots. Without unity you simply cannot play as a team. Because a computer can take directions without question but a leader and his team have feelings. Which is why unity is important, added Epasinghe
Epasinghe wishes to thank his parents and teachers for all the guidance and the trust placed in him. They have played a big part in him being a prefect. His parents give him a lot of strength.
As I mentioned before bringing out the best in people is my concern night or day. One must work very hard to find the qualities within them and use the potential within them through a process of searching themselves, said Epasinghe
Epasinghe is a person who reads books extensively. That is what he does when he confronts a particularly stressful period. His main favorites are adventure stories. An admirer of Abraham Lincoln, Epasinghes admiration of Lincoln came from that fact that Lincoln was a man who had integrity and character and who came up the hard way in life.
The teachers at the Highlands are very concerned about the performance and the well- being of the child. If the child has a particular difficulty there is a support system in place to help them. The teachers are very accessible and approachable, stated Epasinghe
Epasinghe proudly calls himself a man of many sides to his character. He is not a Jack of all trades but he is resourceful and has many talents  IT and Sports.
Life is not black and white. There is a grey area. Our blood is red regardless of which ethnicity we belong to. We should not judge others by the money they have or which race they belong to or their color, said Epasinghe
When he talks, his school mates listen to him. He is a friend to all. A devout Buddhist he goes to temple every Poya day which makes him calm and he also meditates to calm his mind. This helps him achieve peace of mind even when the duties at times become a little stressful.
Epasinghe knows all about the value of trust as he was betrayed once. It had cost him a lot.
Time is of the utmost importance to me and I always make time for my family while working according to a time table. I love my school and the Prefects Guild because of their unwavering support and the help they give me, said Epasinghe

The case against former Sports Minister and MP Mahindananda Aluthgamage for the alleged criminal breach of trust of funds amounting to Rs. 3.9 million belonging to a trade union named Sri Lanka Nidahas Kamkaru Congress, was yesterday fixed for trial on March 6 by the Colombo High Court.
The case was to be taken up for trial yesterday, but Presidents Counsel Nalin Ladduwahetty withcounsel Hafeel Farisz appearing for Aluthgamage, moved court that the case be fixed for a new trial date since the defence was yet to receive a copy of a written complaint made by the third witness Wasantha Samarasinghe.
Counsel Hafeel Farisz appearing for Aluthgamage, moved court that the case be fixed for a new trial date since defence was yet to receive a copy of a written complaint made by the third witness Wasantha Samarasinghe.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appearing for the Attorney General told court that defence was asking a document which had not been listed in the indictments.

Cabinet approves amend Audit Bill
The Cabinet has given its green light for the amended Audit Bill, a Cabinet Minister told the Daily News yesterday.
He said the Audit Bill was presented to the Cabinet again, incorporating the amendments proposed by the Ministerial Sub-committee headed by Dr. Sarath Amunugama while the Cabinet endorsed the amended Bill.
The long overdue National Audit Bill, which has been procrastinated for 13 long years, was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena that was also included in the 100-day work programme of the Government.
Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe pointed out that the Audit Service Commission which was appointed following the passage of 19th Amendment, to the Constitution, has been inactive for over two and half years now due to absence of legal provisions.
The final draft of the Bill was revised over 23 times, mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision which provides for a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to the Government for which he is held responsible.
Several ministers were conspicuous by their absence at the first Cabinet meeting after the mini-reshuffle held at the Presidential Secretariat yesterday. Agriculture Minister Duminda Dissanayake said the President read out a few names at the outset of the meeting noting that they had officially informed of their inability to attend the meeting.
Among the absentees were Ministers Navin Dissanayake, Susil Premajayantha, Dr.Sarath Amunugama, Arjuna Ranatunga, Thalatha Athukorale, Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Harin Fernando. Some were on overseas tours.
National Co-existence, Dialogue and Official Languages Minister Mano Ganesan said the communal tensions in Ampara were given special attention at the meeting. He said Ministers Daya Gamage, Rauf Hakeem, Rishad Bathiudeen and he raised the issue and security situation in the area was extensively discussed at the meeting.
Minister Gamini Jayawickrema Perera speaking to the media after the Cabinet said the two parties in the ruling coalition may work together even at the Local Government Authorities level to make sure that the people in villages get the benefit from national level development initiatives.
Questioned by the media outside the Secretariat, Minister Duminda Dissanayake said if a No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister was presented, the SLFP will stand by the collective decision of the National Government.

Chinese charm
The Embassy of the Peoples Republic of China in Colombo and The China Cultural Center will be holding the China Cultural Fair 2018 in order to celebrate the Chinese New Year 2018. The Chinese New Year also known as the Spring Festival speaks of new beginnings and new life.
Daily News met up with the Embassy Peoples Republic of China, Cultural Attache Liu Dong who spoke about the significance of these events.
The Lantern Festival is also during the Chinese New Year celebrations. The Spring Festival is also one of the most important festivals in Chinese Culture and for the Chinese people. It has a 4000-year-old history.
Back home
To the Chinese people, it is a time for family gathering, many workers go home to reunite with their families. That is why it is so important and during this season, there is great pressure for Chinese transportation companies to transport all the people back home, said Dong.
Different regions all over China have different traditions, but all gather to celebrate the Chinese New Year or the Spring Festival. After this festival, Spring is coming and the spring is very important for Chinese people because when Spring comes people have to work. People come to work and farm the land. Spring means you need to plan ahead for the rest of the year. So it is very important, stated Dong
The Lantern Festival is also a beautiful festival where people make Lanterns to Celebrate the Chinese New Year.
Lantern means fire. It means brightness. And this light will dispel all darkness. It will expel the demons. It has a similarity to Sri Lankan culture where we worship the light. The light will expel the darkness and the devil. It symbolizes a bright future and a bright new year, explained Dong.
The zodiac sign of the Dog signifies the Chinese new year for 2018, where Chinese nationals all around the world celebrating this most important event of the Chinese lunar calendar. The Chinese nationals would call this year The year of the Dog with wishes for prosperity, good health and happiness!
Rich traditions
Signifying the above, The China Cultural Fair is hosted for the 2nd time in Sri Lanka bringing the excitement and the cultural entertainment of China much closer to the Sri Lankan public who are now aware of the rich traditions of the Chinese culture.
This event is planned as a collection of programs where the visitors can enjoy the magnificent lanterns made by Chinese artists, street food organized by prominent Chinese restaurants in Colombo, and many other attractions.
The youth in China also look forward to celebrating these festivals. Because when it comes to priorities, family comes first in the Chinese Culture. Now the young people have new ideas about celebrating the New Year. The young Chinese are independent but still, they want to come home to celebrate the New Year with their parents. So the home is very important. The family is sacred. These traditions are still respected in China, pointed out Dong.
So these traditions are passed down from one generation to the next generation. It is the backbone of the Chinese people and has been for the last 4000 years.
Spring marks a new beginning and a new start. A new chapter in life. It is all about working hard. Like Sri Lanka relatives visit each other and families get together. We welcome the gods and worship our ancestors. The Chinese culture places great emphasis on family, because if the family is peaceful and strong, then the entire society is strong.
The whole society will be peaceful. Then the whole country will be peaceful, explained Dong.
ITEMS TO LOOK FORWARD TODURING THE CULTURAL FAIR
 Exhibition of Chinese Lanterns
The highlight of the fair is the lantern exhibition. The lanterns are made by Haitian Lantern Company. These lanterns would be featuring Chinese Zodiac, Chinese figures with traditional costumes and a large panda lantern would certainly light up the Arcade independence Square for the amusement of visitors.

Lessons from Melbourne
A couple of months back, I visited Melbourne and I was astonished to see the perfect cleanliness, green beauty and systems of the country. Especially, the law and order of the country are strictly followed by the people. If someone fails to follow the road rules and regulations they would be spot fined.
Every action is under surveillance of camera in public places, transports roads and so on. Be as it may the drivers and the pedestrians patiently wait at the traffic light posts until the lights turn into green. Travelling by public transport in that country was very comfortable and enjoyable. Either in the buses or trains no pushing and pulling the fellow commuters. Further, there are no conductors to issue tickets only self- service by using the machines. Surprisingly, I had not seen people spitting on the roads, a common practice in Sri Lanka.
Most importantly, people do not throw any trash on the streets instead they strictly use the bins which are placed everywhere. The cleanliness of the public toilets, worst in our country, is unbelievable. Top of all, Human beings are valued and respected to the most in a reciprocal way. People are very much cultured.
The significant opportunities given to the children can be observed in every aspect obviously. Moreover, food items are free of adulteration. Above all people can move around the country freely without fear day and night. All in all, Melbourne is a peaceful and lovely city of Australia. The truth is, once Australia was also under colonization. Then, why we, the Sri Lankans, cannot practice such sterling qualities to make a better, healthy and beautiful Sri Lanka.

Clash of the roses
The buds failed to open up.
Flowers perished.
And plants withered.
As the War of Roses commenced from the Houses of York and Lancashire and ended upon the Bosworth Field in 1485.
This is the scenario that Shakespeare prepared before he embarked on writing RICHARD 111. The stage was set but not really because this tragedy had to be absolutely and historically correct. So, he derived his facts from chroniclers of his own who were Raphael Holinshed and Edward Hall. Earlier, Hall too depended on the accuracy of Richard's life based on by Sir Thomas More's personal contacts. As a More had lived in the household of John Morton who was the Bishop of Ely in RICHARD 111 but as a friend and adviser to Henry because he has had inside information though he remained on the side of Tudors.
Against rebels
There are two plays about his reign in Henry IV Parts 1 and 2. He stood well but died a tormented royal. The plays highlight the wars against Northern rebels and the way his son, Prince Hal turns to be an addict who later gives up all his habits demonstrating he was fit to be a king Shakespeare's greatest comedy character who appears in many of his plays, Sri John Falstaff is one of his drinking partners.
To understand the vicious wars between the English noble houses of York and Lancashire and their royalty involved, the best guide is William Shakespeare's plays who may not have been very familiar with English history, which marked the end of medieval English and the birth of the Renaissance.
This was the end of its thirty year period of strife and bloodshed, the shame of English which the succeeding generations have called the wars of roses. This saw the collapse of the great Plantagenet dynasty who were the rulers of all England and much of French for over three hundred years. It also saw the rise of the Tudors who were destined to dominate English political era during the next century followed by the triumph of Henry Tudor over RICHARD 111 at Bosworth Field. In my opinion, as well as many who would agree with me, Richard is the villain of the piece and responsible for the wars from which he met his own death.
The War of Roses preceded the reign of Richard 111 born in 1452 and died at Bosworth Field in 1485 which makes his reign one of the shortest in British History that exploded as one of the most famous as well as an infamous era of a king. The War of Roses laid the foundation for what was to become even before he ascended the throne with many gruesome killings and assassinations of those who stood in the way dividing the Houses of York and Lancashire. King Richard 111 achieved his ambition even sacrificing the lives of the two young and innocent princes along with his wife, Anne who was poisoned.
Conflicts and tension
Later, the descendants of Edward 111 who fought for the throne resulted in dividing the Houses of York and Lancashire paved the was to all conflicts and tension.
The story behind this period in England's history which Shakespeare investigated the complex along with the mysteries connecting the sudden marriage of Edward IV and the seizing of Edward's throne by his brother Richard of Gloucester that tied up one of the most heart-rendering killings of the innocence, Richard's nephews in the Tower of London. This gruesome act turned history in another direction which otherwise would have prevented the wars of roses. I read somewhere that a contemporary of Shakespeare saying that he hurried through these plays without blotting a line until history was genuine. They had come spontaneously from a full-charged mind. We can take it for granted his habit of historical research to please himself and perhaps some part of this intense reality, can make us understand the full impact of the wars of the roses, though many years apart.
But one must remember that Shakespeare was more concerned in a highly tensed drama over propaganda. He wrote the play making it much shorter time when and where events occurred. One example in the play that stands out is the scene where he sees his brother being led to the Tower of London while Richard goes straight to Henry's funeral and courts Lady Anne.
Shakespeares scene
Here, there is a lapse in history. It was seven years before Clarence was imprisoned that Richard married Anne. Critics assumed that Shakespeare opted to write in this manner regardless of history, was to bring into focus Richard's ruthlessness. For me, this theory does not fit anywhere because if I recall faintly the two events I wrote at an exam on British History, there was a flaw somewhere, Probably the time gap between Henry's death and Richard's marriage to Anne.
Shakespeare was determined to portray Richard as a villain much than he was, taking a cue from Nicolo Machiavelli's book the Prince where he advocates that a ruler must be cunning and ruthless to acquire anything he needs. Shakespeare emphasizes his ruthlessness, drawing attention to his deformed body and a hunched back but I am sure history has it that he had a very handsome face which he used for his conquests and succeeded even luring Anne into marriage. For those who may have read Hunchback of Notre Dame, there is a similarity between the two but the difference lay in the pathetic face that the hunchback had as against the incredibly attractive face of Richard.
Henry VI who is yet a child struggle among the lords who ruled England, and the French-led by Joan of Arc, win back the lands held by England. As a part of an agreement for peace, the boy Henry is married off to Princess Margaret of Anjou. This is followed by the wars of roses again when England is torn by civil war. For the battles to be won, Lancaster chooses red roses while Lancaster and white roses for Yorkshire. The disgraced son of Duke of York, Richard Plantagenet leads the Yorkists while the Duke of Gloucester leads Lancaster. They both engage in open battle and kill all those who oppose them, especially behind the scenes.
Single combat
With a heavy trail of mass murder committed against those whom he hated, Richard fights bravely as the war rages. He wishes to kill Richmond is a single combat and when the two meet at Bosworth, Edward is slain by Richmond.
One of the most colourful tragedies of Shakespeare where scores of royals that dot British history, are seen walking in and out it when and if it pleases the Bard to make this colossal tragedy more spectacular to please his audience.
The foulest deed was the killing of the two innocent princes, young Edward and his kid brother. But Shakespeare was also very vague about their assassinators who may have wished to please Edward. There is yet another view that the boy princes may have outlived Edward and put away by Henry VII. Whoever did it, he placed their bodies under the staircase of the Tower. And during the time of King Charles ll's reign, they were reburied in the Westminster Abbey.
Rose war
Like most historians, he was motivated by the subjects that he majored in; modern history at Oxford and Reading Universities. There is considerable scope for debate as to what acts lead to which consequences. The run-up to the War of Roses and the aftermath has dazzled the imagination of scholars as they unravel its hidden consequences and one such person is Robin Neillands who in his book, has handled the confusing period of English history. He is so minutely accurate to the dot, the book is enough even to do a theory by its self without any supportive subjects. That's how good he is. The beginning is uncertain. He questions:
a) Did trouble start when Henry Bolingbroke usurped the throne of Richard II
B) When Henry V died in 1422 with his conquests incomplete
C) The power struggle between Cardinal Beaufort and Humphrey, Duke of Gloucester
d) When Henry VI concluded decades of his incompetent rule with bouts of insanity.
e) And much more who had their parts to play in the Wars of Roses.
Neillands kick starts this book with where The Hundred Years Of War ended, with the English defeat at Cotillion which was the final bout of relations between Dukes of York and Somerset which triggered the thirty year period. He traces the complexity of this period through to 1455 and continue to Battle of Bosworth Field where the formation adopted by King Richard's army to the foul deeds planned and committed by him; the medieval mysteries, the death of Edward, Prince of Wales, and the subsequent deaths of Richard, Duke of York, and the innocent young princes at the Tower.
For scholars past and present, students of English history and the general public in search of enlightenment on the Wars of the Roses, there can never be a book better than this.

CPC refutes rumours of fuel shortage
The country has no diesel shortage whatsoever, the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation in a statement issued yesterday said refuting rumours of a diesel shortage spread by certain parties.
The statement said the corporation would take stern legal action against the parties trying to drive motorists into panic by spreading false news about a diesel shortage.
The corporation had received information that a social website and certain sections of the media were trying to destabilise the country by spreading a false rumour about a diesel shortage countrywide, the statement added.
Adequate stocks of diesel, petrol, kerosene and other fuel are held at the Kolonnawa oil installation terminal and the Muthurajawela installations and as such it would request people not to panic.
The corporation has already taken steps to lodge a complaint with the CID requesting it to take firm action against people spreading false information.

Cultural Ministry conserves over 3,600 Ola manuscripts
Under the ancient Ola leaf manuscript national conservation project, more than 3,600 Ola manuscripts belonging to Gampaha District Buddhist temples have been conserved for use of future generations by the Cultural Ministry.
Under the first phase of the project, 3,600 Ola manuscripts have been selected for conservation from 55 temples.
The Centre Cultural Fund would release the first volume the of the national Ola manuscripts list in due course after enclosing the contents of the conserved manuscripts to it.
But most of the Ola manuscripts are deteriorating for several reasons, including the lack of proper conservation methods and poor storing.
In ancient times, valuable data including religious teachings, Aurvedic medical systems and much valuable knowledge in many fields, were conserved with the Ola manuscripts for the future.
But there was no proper mechanism to protect or conserve them.
Having considered this situation, the project was started under the guidance of Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam. Under this national project, motions are underway to identify valuable Ola manuscripts countrywide.

Developing countries must tackle debt together: FM
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera warned that with advanced economies rebounding, developing countries must prepare for tightening global market conditions, at the opening meeting of the G-24 in Colombo, yesterday .
It is clear that Sri Lanka, like many developing nations, (faces) refinancing risks in the coming years, Minister Samaraweera said at the BMICH yesterday. This warrants a concerted and coordinated policy response to mitigate such risks. The G-24 meets every year to coordinate the development strategies of its member countries and make sure their interests are represented in international financial monetary matters.
The G-24 comprises developing countries in Asia, Africa and Central and South America. Minister Samaraweera is chairing the group this year on behalf of Sri Lanka. The theme of this years meetings is debt management and sustainability.
(Its) a very timely theme, Samaraweera said. With an economic rebound leading to increasing interest rates, the International Monetary Funds latest global outlook predicts that economies with high gross debt refinancing needs and un-hedged dollar liabilities (would be) particularly exposed to financial distress, he said. Samaraweera said that according to the IMFs Fiscal Monitor, over 90 percent of low-income developing countries had debt levels over 30 percent of their GDP at end 2016. Sri Lankas debt to GDP ratio stands at about 80 percent.He said the countries must work together to develop policy frameworks to reduce their financial exposure.
You would, I am certain, ensure that our common interests are fairly and adequately addressed at the forthcoming Bretton Woods meetings in Washington D.C., he said.
The G-24 is meeting for two days in Colombo ahead of a conference of representatives of global financial leaders like the IMF and World Bank in April.

Egyptian driver murders Sri Lankan maid after love affair
An Egyptian twenty-two-year old driver is being held in custody for four days over charges of killing a 54-year-old Sri Lankan maid who worked in Egypt after a love affair had transpired between them.
The suspect, Mahmud R, admitted during interrogations by Giza prosecutors the details of the story which ended with the maids murder.
The suspect and the maid worked for a former police officer who resided in the Fifth Settlement during which an affair took place between them, according to the suspect. He asked for permission from his family to marry the victim and travel with her to Sri Lanka, but the family refused.
The victim and the suspect left their work and the latter attempted to cut communication with the maid who insisted to meet with him as usual in a rented apartment in Cairos Shubra al-Kheima area.
The maid told the suspects brother she was pregnant and threatened to disgrace his family and to resort to the Sri Lankan Embassy in Cairo.
According to the suspects confessions, he then contacted the maid and told her that his family pressured him to get engaged to a girl from his home town in Sohag governorate.
The victim continued to threaten him, so he asked to meet her. The suspect convinced the maid that he was going to marry her and took her to the regional road in Giza where he stabbed her in her neck before dragging her on the roadside and pouring gasoline on her body trying to set fire to it.
His attempt failed as a vehicle passed by the scene of the incident upon which he tried to escape.
The security authorities arrested the suspect in Abu Simbel in Aswan as he was driving the microbus used in the crime. The mobile phone of the victim and a bladed weapon were found in his possession.
Prosecutors ordered the suspect to be remanded in custody for four days and he was charged with murder and possessing a bladed weapon. - Egypt Independent

Fails to find a place in 20-member preliminary Nidahas trophy T20 squad
End of the road for Lasith Malinga
Fast bowler Lasith Malingas failure to make it to the preliminary squad of 20 named by the Lankan cricket selectors for next months Hero Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series with India and Bangladesh may mark the end of his career in international cricket.
Malinga, 34 has been trying to impress the selectors with some impressive performances for NCC in the ongoing SLC Twenty20 tournament inspiring them to three successive wins with eight wickets taken at an average of 10.62 and an economy rate of 7.08, making him the second highest wicket-taker in the tournament after Colts left-arm spinner Prabath Jayasuriya who has 10 wickets.
But with the next cricket World Cup scheduled for 2019 and the next World T20 for 2020, Malinga who has lost some of his deadly pace that had once made him a feared bowler in the one-day format is most unlikely to be in the national selectors shortlist.
Malingas last appearance for his country was in September last year against India in a T20 international at R Premadasa Stadium. He also failed retain his place with Mumbai Indians and to attract any bidders for this years IPL.
With Sri Lanka producing so many match winners in recent matches in the form of 22-year-old fast bowler Shehan Madushanka who performed a hat-trick on his ODI debut, and the return of Dushmantha Chameera to white ball cricket and the vast improvement made in his overall cricket by fast bowling all-rounder Thisara Perera, the chances of Malinga finding a place in the eleven is fast diminishing.
Wicket-keeper/batsman Kusal Perera and fast bowlers Nuwan Pradeep and Chameera who were nursing injuries proved their fitness by playing in the SLC Twenty20 tournament and find themselves selected in the 20member squad.
MATHEWS RULED OUT
However white ball captain Angelo Mathews once again has to sit on the sidelines. His run with bad luck has not deserted him as he is reported now to have strained a calf muscle during training just days after recovering from a hamstring injury he suffered during the second match of the one-day tri-series in Bangladesh.
Mathews continuous battle with injuries has been put down by the Lanka team physios to his heavy work load in previous years where he played as an all-rounder in addition to shouldering the captaincy across all three formats.
In his absence the burden of captaincy has once again fallen on the shoulders of Dinesh Chandimal who led Sri Lanka to victories in the Bangladesh one-day tri-series and the T20 international series.
The final squad of 15 players will be named announced today. The tournament commences on March 6.
SRI LANKA T20 PRELIMINARY SQUAD:
Dinesh Chandimal (Captain), Upul Tharanga, Danushka Gunathilaka, Kusal Mendis, Dasun Shanaka, Kusal Perera, Thisara Perera, Jeewan Mendis, Suranga Lakmal, Niroshan Dickwella, Sadeera Samarawickrama, Isuru Udana, Jeffrey Vandersay, Akila Dananjaya, Amila Aponso, Asitha Fernando, Lahiru Kumara, Nuwan Pradeep, Dushmantha Chameera, Dananjaya de Silva.

Englands Topley signs white-ball deal with Hampshire
LONDON: Reece Topley has become the latest England international to switch his focus from first-class cricket to the white-ball game, following in the footsteps of Adil Rashid and Alex Hales.
The fast bowler, who has played 10 one-day internationals and six Twenty20 matches for England, has penned a contract with Hampshire for the 2018 season during which he will only play limited-overs cricket. Hampshire Cricket can announce that seamer Reece Topley has signed a white-ball contract with the club for the 2018 season, the club said in a statement.
Topley, who joined Hampshire at the end of 2015, penned the new deal in December as part of a programme to help maximise his playing opportunities while preventing injury throughout the course of the season. The left-armers 2017 season was ravaged by injury and he did not play after July due to a stress fracture in his back following an earlier hand problem.
It has been a frustrating time for me as a young bowler, said the 24-year-old. It is hoped that this proposal will assist me by preventing further injury as my body matures.
Going forward, I do hope to return to red-ball cricket and still harbour ambitions of being the first left-arm fast bowler to take 100 Test wickets for England but that remains a long-term goal. Batsman Hales announced last week he had signed a new limited-overs contract with Nottinghamshire after England leg-spinner Rashid said he would focus solely on white-ball cricket for Yorkshire this season.
The moves are likely to strengthen fears that Englands top limited-overs internationals could abandon first-class, or red-ball, cricket, which includes five-day Test matches, in favour of playing in lucrative domestic Twenty20 competitions around the world.
But Englands Jos Buttler, currently on tour in New Zealand, still hopes for a return to Test cricket.
I havent played a great deal of red-ball cricket recently. Whether that opportunity comes (depends on) performance, he was reported as saying in the Guardian newspaper.
I think at the back-end of this year Ill be available for quite a lot of (County) Championship cricket -- so if Im going to get back in thats when I need to score runs.

A sum of Rs. 1,000 million had been allocated for the renovation of the Eastern Province (EP) Health Services Department and its equipment, last year, Deputy Health Minister Faizal Cassim said.
He was addressing the opening ceremony of the Eastern Province Health Services Training Institute constructed at a cost of Rs. 34 million at the Thiraimadu Tsunami resettlement area in Batticaloa, recently (25).
The deputy Health minister further said, We are able to initiate various important programmes in the heath sector of the Eastern Province under the guidance of Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna. Even though such a large sum is not permitted to be allocated to a provincial council, it was due to the personal efforts of Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratna that this endeavour was made possible.
The plan to improve health services for the next 25 years have been drawn up and are being implemented under the Good Governance government. Before this government finishes its term, we shall implement the proposed plan in the Eastern Province. We are planning a propose to the government that the faulty equipment be repaired in the Eastern Province itself, without being sent to Colombo.

Final decision concerning Brig. Fernando to be taken up today: Military sources
A final decision with regard to the future course of action concerning Brigadier Priyanka Fernando, is expected to be taken today, according to reliable Military sources.
The Minister Counsellor (Defence) attached to the Sri Lanka High Commission in London, Brigadier Priyanka Fernando was recalled to Sri Lanka due to security concerns and held consultations with Army Commander Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake.
He is said to have explained the incident noting that he had pointed to the Sri Lanka flag on his shoulder, but that the throat slashing incident was not meant for the protestors, but was an indication to the sergeant to say the event was over. Meanwhile, with regard to news reports that he was to leave for a career course in China, Military sources said that it was definitely not compulsory, but it would be decided by this evening as to whether Brigadier Priyanka Fernando would prefer to take up the course. He, himself understands that it would be difficult for him to continue his stint in London under the present situation, but the decision is his to make, the source added.
With regard to the family of the Brigadier, these sources added that there were no valid grounds to warrant the immediate return of his family. These are countries that respect human rights and there are no grounds to send back the Brigadiers family as his children were attending school, while it takes time for them to organise these matters, the source added.

Foremost place to Buddhism,equal rights to all will be guaranteed- PM
The foremost place accorded to Buddhism and the right to equality in the Constitution should be guaranteed without causing conflict, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
The Prime Minister said it is done in some other countries such as in South Africa without causing any conflict.
Prime Minister Wicremesinghe added that in those countries too, the foremost place is accorded to one religion while assuring to religious freedom and rights of other religions.
The Premier was speaking at the launch of the National Policy on Reconcilliation and Co-Existance in Sri Lanka and the premiere of the film "Thundenek" at the Regal Cinema yesterday.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe further said that according to the Mahawansa, some kings had united the country. He added that they had united various races and religions. "There was Theravada Buddhism practised in the country while there were other religions like Jainism as well," the Prime Minister said.
"Thereafter, Hinduism arrived followed by Islam and other religions. Today, we have an office for reconcilliation." The Premier said the country faced a terrorist war for three decades which brought death and destruction.
He added that a mandate was given to Maithripala Sirisena on January 8 to bring about reconcilliation.
The Prime Minister added that an office has also been set up for this purpose and the National Policy was also launched yesterday.
"This is not the end of reconcilliation and co-existance," Premier Wickremesinghe said.
"This is but the begining of an arduos journey to strengthen reconcilliation and we have to achieve it." The Premier added that the people of different communities fear that these processes would be prejudiced against them. "The Sinhala people think that there is no other land for them and those from Jaffna think that they would loose theirs,' Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said. "We have to pay attention to their fears when we find solutions to their issues." President Maithripala Sirisena who participated as the Chief Guest delivered the key-note address while former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga in her capacity as the Chairpersom of the Office for National Unity and Reconcilliation delivered the welcome speech.

Fresh initiatives to promote wellness tourism sector
Wellness tourism sector has been identified as one of the key sectors for development and promotion in the National Export Strategy and accordingly, a plan of action has been developed with key stakeholders, said Indira Malwatte, Chairperson and CEO of Sri Lanka Export Development Board.
The EDB has taken various initiatives to promote the Sri Lankan wellness industry to gain more international recognition for this sector and promote the country as a destination for high quality wellness service, she said speaking at a seminar on wellness tourism, organized by the EDB.
Sri Lanka has a well-established medical system in indigenous medicine, western health services and other alternative medical practices which make the country as an ideal destination for medical travelers.
We work on our quality and the Sri Lankan certification to be accepted internationally. I think that is something that we can take forward. It is not only the treatment part of it, then the after sales of it. Concoctions, balms would be the next stage; if somebody is happy with that , then there will be a follow up , after sales on that,she said. The sector has two strong professional bodies for both the western and indigenous sectors. Sri Lanka offers a wide range of wellness services at the luxury Ayurveda resorts, indigenous medicine hospitals, spa and recreation centers and western hospitals. (IH)

Gotas interim order extended
The Court of Appeal (CA) yesterday further extended until March 23, its interim order preventing police from acting against former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act, regarding a Magistrate's Court inquiry.
A two-judge bench comprising Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Gunaratne extended this Interim Order preventing police from acting under the Public Property Act against Rajapaksa, on Galle Magistrates court inquiry over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs. 90 million.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva who appeared on behalf of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is to make his further oral submissions on the next date as well. Subsequently, Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne is expecting to make his oral submissions on behalf of the Attorney General.

Govt. plans to eliminate tobacco cultivation in 2020: CCT
Centre for Combating Tobacco Director Dr. Mahesh Rajasuriya said, the government plans to eliminate tobacco cultivation in 2020 in Sri Lanka, at a programe in Janaki Hotel on February 26.
Presidential Task Force on Drug Prevention Director Dr. Samantha Kumara Kithalawaarachchi and Dr. Manuja Perera of the Public Health Department also participated for the programme. Center of Combating Tobacco (CCT), Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo and Presidential Task Force on drug Prevention had been carrying out investigations about tobacco cultivation.
Dr. Mahesh said that more than 80 percent of CTCs tobacco leaf requirement is grown during the Yala season when the farmers have no alternative but to grow a cash crop for the lack of adequate water essential for paddy. The income derived during the handful of months in the Yala season turns the farmers into millionaires, allowing them to breathe easy during the rain-heavy, paddy cultivation-friendly Maha season.
A plethora of evidence exist to confirm that tobacco cultivation and its final product lead to many adverse effects on public health, environment and the socio economic status of the country.
Tobacco cultivation was first introduced to Sri Lanka under Portuguese rule in colonial times. At present Matale, Polonnaruwa, Monaragala, Kandy and Anuradhapura are identified as the main districts that cultivate tobacco in Sri Lanka. Ceylon Tobacco Company (CTC), the subsidiary of British American Tobacco (BAT) runs a leaf to cigarette manufacturing process in the country and domestically grown tobacco is also used in chewing tobacco products and other smoking products such as beedi, he said.
Dr.Mahesh further said that Tobacco farming is harmful to the environment and farm workers, with multinational companies contributing to the problem by exploiting local farmers. They found that tobacco farming causes green tobacco sickness (GTS) in farm workers who absorb nicotine through the skin when handling wet tobacco. GTS causes muscle weakness, headache, nausea, vomiting, dizziness, abdominal cramps, breathing difficulty, diarrhea, chills, fluctuations in blood pressure or heart rate, and increased perspiration and salivation.
Children working in tobacco farming face other serious risks as well. Children also reported that tractors sprayed pesticides in nearby fields.
They said the spray drifted over them, making them vomit, feel dizzy, and have difficulty breathing and a burning sensation in their eyes. Many of the pesticides used in tobacco production are known as neuro toxins, poisons that alter the nervous system.
The long-term effects of childhood pesticide exposure can include cancer, problems with learning and cognition, and reproductive health issues.

Horses for courses
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne has said that the Law and Order portfolio, assumed by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, at Sunday's Cabinet reshuffle, was only a stop gap measure, and, that, Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka will be taking over the subject in two weeks time. Fonseka, who was overseas during the UNP segment of the reshuffle, was spoken of as the likely successor to Sagala Ratnayaka from the time it was known that a Cabinet reshuffle was in the offing. It is not clear if Dr. Senaratne's statement is official. But he certainly has set the cat among the pigeons.
Even before this announcement was made hardliner cleric the Ven. Bengamuwe Nalaka had threatened to take to the streets, with 1,000 monks, if Sarath Fonseka was made Law and Order Minister. There had been other, more muted, expressions of opposition from Bikkhus in the Rajapaksa camp. Why this objection to a war hero receiving his just rewards by the very people who are castigating the government for engaging in a witch-hunt against the country's war heroes Is the role played by Sarath Fonseka, who commanded the army to victory, any less than that of Commodore D. P. K. Dassanayake, over whom today the pro-Rajapaksa Buddhist monks, like the Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananada Thera, are weeping buckets, as being one of the victims subjected to a witch-hunt by the government, for arraigning him for his alleged role in the abduction of Tamil youth, for ransom.
In contrast, what was the reaction of these patriots when Sarath Fonseka was dragged away, thrown behind bars and left to languish suffering privations for two years in prison, in connection with yet unproved allegations As Dr. Senaratne said; Sarath Fonseka is a war hero. Those who make a big hue and cry about war heroes should realize that. Those personnel who robbed and killed, had also been venerated as war heroes. Besides, the government also ought to take a fair and just decision. What the country needs today were efficient people who could take split decisions.
The minister has put things in a nutshell. His views, in this regard, will be endorsed by many who feel that the government needs to put its foot down on sabotage and disruptive activities that has been the norm in recent times.
No doubt, the spate of protests, strikes, and, other forms of disruption in the day-to-day life also contributed to the adverse results for the government at the local government elections. The people felt that the government had lost control and things were allowed to drift, with no firm hand to combat these activities which brought hardship on the public. The petroleum crisis, CEB strikes, the doctors all too frequent work stoppages, and, the anti-SAITM streets protests, not only portrayed a general breakdown of the system but also had its impact in other forms, such the dent these made on investor confidence.
Felix Dias Bandaranaike, it was, who once said that a little bit of totalitarianism would not be out of place in democratic Sri Lanka, and, went about doing just that. Such a stratagem will be needed in the present day too, if things tend to get out of hand. Sarath Fonseka has already made it known publicly that he would control all unruly campaigns and activities, not to mention, going after the big time rogues of the former regime, if he is given the job of Law and Order minister for six months. Given his record on the battlefield, and the fact that he led his troops to victory, is testimony that he means what he says. He also famously said that he would not leave the war to be finished by his successor, and lived up to his word.
With the pohottuwa victory at the LG elections, there had be reports of attacks on rival supporters, especially in the provinces, with the police slow to act to apprehend the culprits, betraying a loss of control by the authorities, in the immediate aftermath of the polls, of the law enforcement machinery. There have also been heightened incidents of crime in recent times, in the south, and the free availability of firearms used by gangs in tit for tat killings. The drug menace too is taking on serious proportions, with almost daily detections being made, indicating the big time operatives are still at large. Underworld crime in the urban areas too have spiraled, in recent times, despite the best efforts of the IGP and his men.
Gen. Fonseka, who was known for his no nonsense attitude, during his military career, will certainly have a lot on his plate, if, and, when he is appointed Law and Order Minister. But, as minister Dr. Senaratne hinted, there is no doubt that he will live up to his reputation, and, turn things around in his own inimitable style. His possible advent, no doubt, would have already ruffled many feathers in the Joint Opposition camp. But, it is incumbent that the government uses his skills to the optimum level to bring about a semblance of order into things.

The programme has a unique structure as it lining up children with a team sports spirit in day-to-day activities like walking, running, spinning and throwing in a fun and exciting manner with a scientific perspective can help meet their physical exercise requirement.
Children should engage in physical activity programmes based on the 'Four F' concept (Fun, Fitness, Fundamental and Friendship) conducted in suitable environments that provide a balanced physical and academic education. In addition to helping children be fit, these activities help recognize students with a talent for a specific sport and help develop their abilities too. Therefore to develop unity, team spirit, friendship and other character building qualities among children, the Ministry of Education introduced the Kids Athletics Programme for primary students in 2015. The programme currently conducts team sports for grades 3, 4 and 5. Nestl sponsors this programme and has been very popular among schools. By developing the basic athletic talent of primary students, the programme aims to improve Sri Lankas future in athletics.
Through this programme, more than 175,000 students participated in 247 divisional level games, 74 zonal level games and seven provincial level games in 2017. All provinces have been represented at this years championship, totaling 5,940 children for the finals (1,920 from Grade 3, 2,016 from Grade 4 and 2,004 from Grade 5).
The national level Grade 5 finals will be worked off on March 25 at the Mari Stella school grounds, Negombo.
The All-Island Schools Kids Athletics Championship is part of Nestles Kids Athletics Programme. It is the physical activity component of the Nestl Healthy Kids Programme which teaches school children about improved diets, healthy cooking, hydration, food safety and hygiene.

Lalith Weeratunga appeals HCs rejection of request to go abroad
Filing a revision application in the Court of Appeal, former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge, who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC, yesterday sought Courts jurisdiction to set aside the Colombo High Court's decision to reject his request to go abroad.
On January 29, the Colombo High Court had rejected a request made by Weeratunge that he be allowed to go abroad.
When the revision application came up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne, the matter was fixed for support on March 2. Weeratunga who was convicted of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) had sought the Colombo High Courts permission to travel to Doha, Qatar and Australia in March and April.
While rejecting the application, High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga had observed there is no legal basis to consider this application, since a person convicted of an offence has no the right to be presumed innocent.
The High Court Judge further observed that the accuseds request cannot be considered as an urgent requirement since his request was not based on a medical requirement.
On September 7, 2017, Weeratunga and Anusha Palpita were found guilty of misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC in the controversial sil redi (fabric used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
They were sentenced to three years rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court.
They had filed appeal petitions in the Court of Appeal challenging the judgement of the Colombo High Court. They are currently out on bail.

LAWASIA on fact finding mission in Maldives, detained and deported
Members of LAWASIA who had arrived in the Maldives for an independent fact finding mission on the state of the judiciary and rule of law in the country, had been detained and thereafter deported at the Velana International Airport in Maldives.
LAWASIA is the law association for Asia and the Pacific and its Council comprises of the peak national bar associations and law societies in the United Nations ESCAP Region.
LAWASIA, President Christopher Leong issuing a statement to the media, stated that though the Government of Maldives had issued a statement on February 7 stating that Maldives would like to invite its development partners and representatives from international organisations and associations to visit the Maldives to assess the situation in the Maldives and witness the safety and security of Male, for their own citizens as well as to engage with the Government and key stakeholders in the country, when LAWASIA had contacted them for a visa, there had not been a positive response from government authorities. Their team had secured several appointments with stakeholders for their fact finding mission which was to be held from February 24 - 28.
Four members of the fact-finding team arrived at the Velana International Airport in Maldives in the evening of February 25, 2018. Each had declared the purpose of the visit upon arrival. Instead of providing guidance and facilitating the mission with a visa as would have been consistent with the open invitation issued by the Government of Maldives to international organisations, the Maldivian authorities had instead, refused entry to the members of the team, detained and kept them at a closed detention facility under guard and surveillance and subsequently, deported them. Although the actions taken by the authorities were inconsistent with their public statements of invitation, the immediate officials who attended to us were courteous, stated the release from LAWASIA.
By such action, the Government of Maldives deprived itself of the benefit of an independent and impartial assessment by a fact-finding team not sponsored by any individual, parties or organisations in the Maldives, they further stated.
The organization however has noted that they would continue with their mission and carry out its mandate.
In this regard, it remains the hope of LAWASIA that the Government of the Maldives and key stakeholders in the country, would take meaningful steps to assist and participate with this task,said LAWASIA.

Lawrences Lawrences flame test
Peaches
Why the groove
Why the lovely, bivalve roundness
Why the ripple down the sphere
Why the suggestion of incision
- A poem by D H Lawrence
The Flame into being is a phrase one comes across only on reading a well-known novel by an equally well-known novelist named D H Lawrence (1885  1930). The title of the novel is Lady Chatterleys Lover. A general reader may not know how the term had been framed by Lawrence, but a well-known biographer Anthony Burgess tried to rediscover in the form of a literary biography the novelist and his works using the title as Flame into Being.
As Burgess explains, this brief book (running to 18 chapters and 211 pages) had its origins in the intentions to write a book even briefer  a centennial tribute to David Herbert Lawrence which should be a sort of payment of a debt. Furthermore, the contents may serve to introduce the man called Lawrence and his writings inclusive of his poems to those who know nothing of either the personal creative process and the personal lifestyle of the creator. As the biographer Burgess underlines, Lawrence was the only great British writer to celebrate a centenary in 1985.
Trials and tribulations
A year devoted to musicians and most of all to Handel who was born in 1685. At the outset, the reader comes to know that the intention is a broad perspective not meant to be a mere profile presentation but an interpretation and analysis of the works and the background experiences that have gone into it. As such the work as a whole has to be considered as a peep into the creative process via the experiences encountered by Lawrence, from childhood, in a colliers village, the gradual bringing up as a scholar, the personal trials and tribulations such as romances to his journeys into various countries inclusive of Sri Lanka (then Ceylon).
Burgess tries to present in the best possible manner, the social ideology that Lawrence held as a young scholar in the creation of his first novels, White Peacock, Sons and Lovers, Women in Love and Lady Chatterleys Lover.
As such, the work could be regarded as a creative investigation into the creation and the creator. Burgess tries as far as possible to be closer to Lawrence when he states that Lawrence died in March 1930 when he was just 13 years old and too unliterary to notice. He stated that at that time he had read Juvenile Shockers in bed with torchlight. In this manner, he had managed to come across Lawrence via a periodical named Boys Magazine.
It had been the prevailing generation gap according to Burgess that had prevented him from knowing intimately who Lawrence was and what he had contributed as a creative narrator and a poet of a lesser fame. As such, he confesses that having discovered James Joyce, he was not at first eager to read Lawrence. He comes to know that in 1960 after court case of some length and much fatuity, Lady Chatterleys Lover was no longer a banned book.
Controversy crisis
So he notes that the lifting of the ban after a long controversy goes to prove not only the integrity of Lawrence, the writer but also the crisis within the living conditions itself. As such, Lawrence ceased to be a subversive writer.
Burgess writes: His [Lawrences] fangs were drawn and he became a mild classic, meaning a writer wrapped in his period. Lawrence had, in a sense, done his work, of bringing about a sexual liberation. But did the society in which Lawrence lived accept his ideology as profound But the point encircled the concept of rationalism. If Lawrence was irrational, it was because he recognised how small a part reason plays in the business of living. The Centre of his response to the external world was the solar plexus, not the cerebral cortex.
Most sensitive poetic visions of Lawrence is embedded in the chapter The Prophecy is in the Poetry. As Burgess states, one of the major achievements of the postwar exile of Lawrence was a series of poems eventually published under the title Birds, Beasts and Flowers. They are denoted as poems because of the intense sensibility they disclose and the emotive and the descriptive daring of the language. But they could as well as fragments of essays, jottings, in a notebook digressions in a story or a novel.
Ezra Pound, the well-known scholar and linguist, saw these jottings as the essence of literature, meaning poetry. The poetry of Lawrence is regarded as simple and sensitive.
Burgess comes to a conclusion by stating that Lawrence accepted the concept of belonging in a manner which his detractors have always been unwilling to understand. As such, Lawrences grief was that cosmos and human society had alike been brought low. Lawrence seems to ask: where were the raging lions and the soaring eagles Only in his poems could be the response.
Disappointing Ceylon
In chapter Eastward, Burgess records his trip to Colombo.
Lawrence had got to Colombo in March 1922. By the beginning of April, Lawrence was ready to dismiss the East as silly. He had said: I dont like it one bit, I dont like the silly dark people or their swarming billions on their hideous holy places. He was perhaps referring to the upcountry pageant or perahera which he had seen with a lack of informative knowledge on the cultural background.
It seems that Lawrence had branded himself as a noble savage. The underlying meaning and vision are quite mythical. While preferring the most naturalistic way of the humans, he detested at times the torture that emerges via manmade rituals for the sake of achieving a higher state of living. Lawrence, according to Burgess, was not limited to one sphere of creations. He tried his hand at the painting which he cultivated as a self-expression. Then comes his essays which are collected as Apocalypse.
They are more random jottings on varied subjects ranging from aesthetics to love and sex. As noted by Burgess, Lawrence died midway between his 44th and 55th birthdays.
Too young An absurd question, but only if we consider that life is a quantifiable substance and that we all have a right for it

Measures will be taken to implement a large number of projects within the next two years under the Mahaweli development programme at a cost of Rs 100 billion, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and State Minister of Mahaweli Development Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a progress review meeting held on Monday February 26 at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry.
The President as the Mahaweli Development Minister has launched several projects in the Mahaweli areas as well as implemented a special program to provide drinking water and water for cultivations to the people in the Northern Province. said the Minister.
The Minister said that all drinking water and irrigation water issues of the people living in the North will be solved with the implementation of Moragahakanda  Uthuru Ela project which is scheduled to be commenced soon.
According to the Minister, many other projects will also be implemented in 2018 exceeding Rs. 100 billion.
Measures will be taken to renovate 2,400 small reservoirs and provide irrigation water to cultivate thousand acres of barren paddy fields.
A large number of small reservoirs have not been renovated for a long period and as a result of this, those tanks are not filled to the capacity and even during a light rain the tanks overflow. Similarly even in a short drought, the tanks get dried up and crops are damaged. As a measure taken to prevent this, 2,400 reservoirs will be rehabilitated. he added.

Members of coopertive societies take to the streets
Over 3,000 members in 100 cooperative societies took the streets of Jaffna yesterday, in protest against the increasing debt situation in the lives of many in the North due to unscrupulous activities of microfinance companies in the area. They marched to the District Secretariat in Jaffna to hand in a letter seeking the government's intervention on behalf of them to control the high debts in their society. The protestors also went to the Governors Office where they handed in a letter addressed to the President along with their demands.
They demand that: all microfinance companies that use unethical and illegal practices be banned, an interest rate cap with an effective annual interest rate not exceeding 25 percent be imposed, so that all predatory loan schemes are immediately stopped, cancel all existing predatory microfinance loans or provide a moratorium for two years necessary to restart sustainable economic activity and expand low interest government credit schemes that could generate sustainable rural livelihoods and rebuild the economy.
Jaffna District Cooperatives Council's Secretary, Vethavalli Selvaratnam, speaking to the Daily News, said many finance companies go into villages and provide loans at high interest rates, often creating a cycle of debt for those who take on the loan.
The members of cooperatives have stated that they could offer the people more sustainable forms of credit if they were supported more and strengthened by the government.
Selvaratnam asked that the 2018 Budget allocation for cooperatives be made available as soon as possible, so that they could offer an alternative source of credit to people.
Jaffna District Thrift and Credit Cooperatives Council Union, Secretary, Kanakambigai Jegarajah in the meantime, said their Co-Op's system ensured that loans are given at low interest rates.
It is more systematic. But when people go and take loans from microfinance companies and they are unable to pay them back, it affects our payback periods too, he added.
The Jaffna District Cooperatives Council headed by T. Suntheralingam in its statement observed that since 2009, indebtedness in the Northern Province was growing at an alarming rate. The lack of opportunities for employment and sustainable livelihoods, have led to microfinance companies charging exorbitant interest rates and effectively acting as loan sharks. They mainly target rural women with annual interest rates ranging from 40 - 220 percent, the statement read.

Parties legally bound to protect 25% womens quota:
Minister tells EC to order than appeal
The Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister has asked the Elections Commission to order rather than appeal to political parties to appoint women through their lists to complete the quota.
This was in a bid to break the deadlock over the 25 percent quota for women in many local councils.
The gazette establishing the councils have been postponed to March 20, Minister Faiszer Musthapha said on the request of the Elections Commission and the current situation with the quota.
We have informed the Elections Commission in writing that the quota should be protected and as a government, we are committed to the quota and are bound to protect it, Minister Musthapha said, addressing a discussion held with womens organizations at the ministry yesterday.
Forty four womens organizations around the country have written to the minister asking that the government ensure that the quota be protected.
Women and Media Collective, Executive Director, Dr Sepali Kottegoda who addressed the discussion, pointed out that their discussions with the Elections Commission had led them to believe that fulfilling the quota was purely in the hands of the political parties and that it would happen only if they decreed so.
In reply, the minister explained, All political parties are legally bound to protect the quota and if they ignore that responsibility, I ask that the Elections Commission to direct them to do it.
The people believe that these parties will keep to the quota and if the parties do not do so, they are in breach of the mandate given to them, he added.
Establishing the quota however, has had significant practical issues in several councils where minor parties have scored 20 percent or less of the vote. Councils especially in the North and East where there were several campaigns asking that people not to vote for women, have been badly affected by this issue - with many not being able to be set up.
For these councils, the Minister said he would have to hold discussions with the Elections Commission and find the best possible solution to implement the quota and if not possible, they would have to look into legal means to amend the structure of the Act to establish the councils.
This has been a victory for women despite the shortcomings, said Minister Musthapha.
When asked whether the quota would also be introduced into the Provincial and Parliamentary electoral system however, the minister was of the opinion that a quota only in local government was sufficient, Before we implement it in the Provincial Councils, we have to see how workable it is at the local government level. We already have problems here, we dont want to mess up all three, he said.
First take what you are given, added the Minister who believed that the local government elections was a good starting point for women who wished to go further.
The Minister together with the womens organisations also proposed that a five member committee comprising of women from these organisations be appointed to look into the problems in the quota and the issues that women faced during the local government elections.

N Korea 'providing materials to Syria chemical weapons factories'

North Korea has been sending equipment to Syria that could be used in chemical weapons manufacturing, US media report, citing findings by UN experts.
The materials include acid-resistant tiles, valves and pipes, reports say.
An as-yet-unreleased UN report also says Pyongyang's missile specialists have been seen at Syrian weapon-making facilities,the New York Times says.
The allegations come after new reports of chlorine gas being used by Syrian forces, which the government denies.
North Korea is under international sanctions over its nuclear programme.
The supplies reported to have been illicitly sent to Syria by North Korea included high-heat, acid-resistant tiles, corrosion-resistant valves and thermometers. The tiles are said to be used to construct facilities where chemical weapons are produced.
Five shipments were sent to Syria via a Chinese trading firm during late 2016 and early 2017, the Wall Street Journal says.They are allegedly part of dozens of shipments over several years.
The Scientific Studies and Research Center (SSRC) - a Syrian government agency - is said to have paid North Korea via a number of front companies, the newspaper reports.
The report - also seen by the Washington Post- was compiled by the UN Panel of Experts, which assesses North Korea's compliance with UN resolutions.
In a September 2017 report, which is publicly available,the group said it was "investigating reported prohibited chemical, ballistic missile and conventional arms cooperation" between Syria and North Korea.
It said that two UN member states had intercepted shipments bound for Syria, and that the goods were suspected to be supplied by North Korea's main arms exporter as part of a contract with front companies representing the SSRC.
UN spokesman Stphane Dujarric did not say whether the leaked report would be published, but told the New York Times: "I think the overarching message is that all member states have a duty and responsibility to abide by the sanctions that are in place."
The Syrian government is reported to have told the UN panel that the only North Koreans present in Syria are sports coaches and athletes.
Syria signed up to the Chemical Weapons Convention and agreed to have its declared chemical weapons stock destroyed in 2013 aftera sarin gas attack killed hundreds of people in Ghouta.
It has been accused of repeatedly using banned chemical weapons in the civil war since then.
The Organisation for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW) concluded that sarin nerve gas was used in Khan Sheikhoun, in Idlib province, last April in an incident that killed more than 80 people. UN investigators said the Syrian air force was to blame.
The US carried out missile strikes on a Syrian air base in responsebut President Bashar al-Assad maintained the incident was faked.
Suspected chlorine gas attacks have been recently reported in Syria, including on Sunday in the Eastern Ghouta, a besieged rebel-held enclave near the capital Damascus.
Experts say that North Korea has long offered military supplies and weapons know-how around the world in exchange for cash.
The UN report is said to highlight its efforts to illicitly trade with dozens of countries and groups in the Middle East, North Africa and Latin America.
Syria and North Korea have decades-old military ties.
Last week, US President Donald Trump said Washington was imposing a fresh set of sanctions on North Korea, targeting more than 50 ships and maritime transport companies in several countries.
North Korea is already under a range of international and US sanctions over its nuclear programme and missile tests.
But it continued tests last year, including tests of a nuclear weapon and a long-range ballistic missile capable of reaching the US.
The US says the new sanctions are designed to put a further squeeze on North Korea, cutting off sources of revenue and fuel for its nuclear programme and clamping down on evasion of already existing restrictions.

In the name  of holiness
Maha Shivaratri also known as the Great Night of Shiva is a spiritual festival held to honour the God Shiva where Hindu devotees are mindful of overcoming darkness and ignorance. Dr Lakshmi Ramaswamy held a performance at the Kaileshwar temple in Colombo on Maha Shivaratri called Aindhaan Potri when she visited Sri Lanka recently.
She did a performance in connection with the Natyanjali. Natyanjali is a performance done in Shiva temples during the Shivaratri time.
Aindhaan Potri is based on the story of 4 Saiva Saint Poets called as Nayanmars namely, Gnana Sambandar, Tirunavukkarasar, Sundarar and Manikkavacakar and one Sekhizar who is considered to have chronicled the inspiring stories of the Nayanmars and who penned the Peria-puranam.
I am going to present fives dances. Each of the Saints had an incident in their lives from which onwards they got into the fold of Shiva. We have added that incident and whatever miracles they have done during their lifetime in the name of Shiva. This is the 22nd production we have done. My dance institution which is Sri Mudhraalaya is 24 years old now. Next year will be our Silver Jubilee, said Ramaswamy.
Lakshmi Ramaswamy is a dancer, choreographer and researcher who hails from Tirunelveli.
She is the first doctorate in Bharatanatyam from Madras University. She is also a recipient of the Fulbright fellowship for Arts and Culture Management studies. Ramaswamy has trained under Chitra Visweswaran, Dr Padma Subrahmanyam and Kalanidhi Narayan.
She is also a top grade artist of the Doordharshan and teaches MA in Bharatanatyam at the Madras University.
I have trained my students in Arangetram and now many of them have become teachers themselves. Many of them are MA holders and Dhoordharshan acknowledged graded artists. Some of them are also doing their PhD, stated Ramaswamy.
Ramaswamy receives a tremendous amount of happiness when creating new performances.
If a mother gives birth to a child, that happiness is similar to what I have when creating new performances. I feel humbled to stage it in front of people. One thing about the classical arts is that it gives happiness. It has a takeaway value, and after anyone watches my productions, there is something to take out of it. It pleases the mind. In my performance, we explore the lives of these saints  how much they have done for religion and society, pointed out Ramaswamy.
To Ramaswamy, the production is deeply meaningful. She also has added Thevaram songs.
This performance is mostly on the devotional side, as it is dedicated to Lord Shiva. It also addresses society as we are social beings. The message in this production is commitment. Commitment is the basis of our lives. We live in a world with so many troubles, but if you are committed you will get your reward. The performance is also religiously oriented. It has been a lot of hard work, explained Ramaswamy.
Sri Mudhraalaya has performed in UK, Bangkok, USA and London but this is the first time they are premiering a performance outside of Chennai.
I am a first generation dancer and my performances have been very well received and critically acclaimed by scholars and people. People who did not appreciate Bharatanatyam have remarked how beautiful it is after watching my performances. Expressing emotions and feelings and portraying characters and stories is my speciality. We just want to go from strength to strength creating productions of high quality. We want to touch on good values and ethics. We want to create nice memories for people when they go home. To be a performer one has to work hard. Dance is spiritual to me because it is mind, intelligence and emotion, added Ramaswamy.

Nations Trust Bank records 31% growth in pre-tax profits
Nations Trust Bank closed the financial year December 31, 2017 with a post-tax profit of Rs.3,371 million, up by 18% over the previous year with pre-tax profits increasing by 31%.
A higher effective tax rate stemming from the increase in the financial services VAT rate as well as the additional tax of Rs. 210Mn on inter-company dividend payments impacted the Group bottom line growth. Healthy portfolio growth and strong fee-based income growth enabled the Group to record higher pre-tax profits, despite the effects of narrower NIMs and an increase in impairment provisions.
The Groups Net Interest Income grew by 26% underpinned by good growth in its advances portfolio.The faster increase in deposits rates which mirrored market trends due to tightening of market liquidity, especially in the first half of the year, resulted in interest expenses increasing by 56% whilst the corresponding increase in interest income was lower at 42%. However, this trend was somewhat reversed in the second half with the decline in cost of funds and a moderate pick-up in NIMs.
Net fee and commission income increased by 29% driven by growth in the cards fee based income, increased trade and transactional fees as well as contributions made from structured financing transactions. Net trading losses for the year amounted to Rs. 558 Mn which is partly reflective of the swap cost arising from an increase in the funding of theforexswap book by30% and increase in SWAP premiums by 117bps.
Impairment charge increased by 58%, stemming primarily from the increase in individual impairment as the weather relatedweakening of thecountrys agriculture sector had trickle down effects on several industry sectors. Previous year individual impairment charge was low as a result of reversals in impairment provisions.
Total operating expenses increased by 15% due to business growth in transactional volumes and increased operational activity. It has been an extremely rewarding year as the Bank not only exceeded in achieving the financial goals set for the year but also successfully executed a numbers of strategic initiatives in our customer experience and digital journey, Director/CEO Renuka Fernando, said.
Loans and advances recorded a well balanced growth of 25%.Depositsgrew by 28% faster than the industry growth of 17%. The Bank successfully concluded a $50Mn funding line from IFC adding more diversity to the medium term funding structure of the bank. During the year, the Bank reached a major mile stone in its digitization journey with thelaunch of Sri Lankas first digital bank, FriMi, a combination of next generation bank account, payment system and e-wallet wrappedup in one convenient app.

NCPA gets tough on child abusers
Tough action will be taken against all acts of mental, physical, cruel and degrading against children, Chairperson of the National Child Protection Authority (NCPA) Attorney Marini De Livera yesterday said in a statement.
In his statement, Chairperson de Livera requested all teachers and principals to be sensitive to the needs of children as a high prevalence of violence against children in educational and other institutes were reported.
The NCPA also observes, Research has shown that children exposed to violence show excessive irritability, emotional distress and develop criminal violent tendencies.
The NCPA notes that the circular issued by the Education Ministry in 2016 (Circular No 12 issued on 29/04/2016) has outlawed physical punishment and has outlined methods of positive discipline, such as advising children, talking to parents and guardians, and limiting privileges enjoyed by the child.
The Authority hopes to create awareness about the contents of the circular through its street drama group and workshops for teachers and principals with techniques such as role play, Chairperson De Livera stated.
The NCPA urges the public to inform of violence against children through its 24-hour toll-free helpline - 1929.

Over 30 believed dead in PNG quake
AUSTRALIA: More than 30 people are believed to have died after a powerful earthquake struck Papua New Guinea's mountainous interior, a report said Tuesday as rescue teams worked to reach the worst-hit areas.
The 7.5-magnitude tremor struck 90 kilometres (55 miles) south of Porgera in the Pacific nation's Enga province early Monday, with two strong aftershocks rattling the rugged region.
Phone lines have been largely cut, but the PNG Post Courier newspaper cited Hela provincial administrator William Bando as saying there were casualties. It reported that at least 13 died in the Southern Highlands capital Mendi while 18 others were believed to have been killed in nearby Kutubu and Bosave. Some 300 people were injured, it added, and properties destroyed, with reports of landslides and sinkholes.
The Papua New Guinea Today website, quoting Catholic priest Pius Hal, said at least 10 died, including four children, in quake-triggered landslides.
AFP was unable to confirm the death toll.
A government assessment team was due to fly into to the area Tuesday to get a better idea of the impact, with the military mobilised to help restore services and infrastructure, the government's Chief Secretary Isaac Lupari said in a statement.
Information will be provided as this is made available from assessment teams in the area, he added.
The tremor hit at a depth of 35 kilometres on Sunday, US seismologists said, with aftershocks of 6.0 and 6.3 magnitude recorded.
The region is home to oil and gas production. ExxonMobil PNG said buildings at its Hides Gas Conditioning Plant were damaged but all its staff were safe and accounted for, with non-essential employees to be evacuated. Australian resources company Oil Search on Monday said its operations in the area were being shut down as a precaution and for damage assessment, and there were no injuries reported among its staff so far. - AFP

PickMe adds top talent from local universities to expand engineering team
Stepping out of being a young tech start-up and making its way towards the larger perimeters of tech-based businesses, PickMe, recently announced a significant expansion of its engineering team to equip the ride-hailing software with the resources needed to cater to the forecasted growth of the company.
This expansion is based on an accelerated recruiting plan where PickMe's partnership with the local universities will enable engineering students from these universities to be trained and recruited by PickMe, having proven their skills on individual projects assigned to them by PickMe and the students mentors.
The students recruited will then have the rare opportunity to be resourced by PickMe to carry out their projects to its completion, thereby bringing their ideas to life and releasing their solutions for the benefits of the local commuters.
PickMe actively presents themselves in a number of career and educational fairs organized by universities in a bid to handpick prospective employees to strengthen their engineering team with the best local talent. With its rapid growth and the continuation to expand its footprint across Sri Lanka, PickMe is positive that its recruitment process will pick pace and accelerate over the next few years.
At PickMe, we believe that efforts aimed at advancing capabilities, maximizing performance and enhancing efficiency of our service will help fuel the innovative solutions needed to uplift the transportation industry of the country and maintain our qualitative edge as the industry leader, said Jiffry Zulfer, Chief Executive Officer of PickMe.
This increased focus creates a need for engineering assets to actively support PickMes innovation through close collaboration with internal and external stakeholders of the company and ultimately, developing the best product which is tailor-made to meet customer expectations. In this regard, we are actively recruiting the best engineering talent from local universities and groom them to become future leaders of Sri Lanka.
As we enter the next crucial phase in our journey, this infusion of fresh blood into the PickMe team will make an invaluable contribution towards shaping an exceptional new portfolio of PickMe products, Zulfer said.
A product of the University of Moratuwa, Aruna Prabhashwara from Halvitigala, Galle, is one such recruit that joined PickMe's team of engineers recently. I have always had a keen interest in doing something new, this is a dream I hoped to achieve when I joined the University of Moratuwa following my A/Ls, in the process I fell in love with software languages and decided that software was a very useful tool to help realize my dream, said Prabhashwara.
When PickMe hosted a hackathon at our university I realized that this was my golden opportunity and I went for it. My project was shortlisted by PickMe and today I'm a Trainee Software Engineer at PickMe, helping build software solutions that can help elevate the transport sector in our country, Prabhashwara commented further.
PickMe recently strengthened its core leadership team further, with the appointment of Isira Perera as the Chief Operating Officer (COO). With his visionary leadership and proven track record in digital financial services and mobile commerce, PickMe is set for a new course of innovativeness and to thrive well in Sri Lankas rising digital economy sphere.
The company also announced a partnership with the Department of Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) and the newly-established Center for Data Science (DataSEARCH) at the University of Moratuwa recently in strengthening and extending the capacity of research and development needed to foster a culture of technological innovation and entrepreneurship in Sri Lanka.
As the software platform that hosts the largest organized taxi fleet in Sri Lanka, with over twelve thousand three-wheelers, mini cars, cars, vans and luxury sedans, PickMe currently services the transportation needs of over one million passengers based in Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara and Kandy regions.
Adding to its portfolio of services, PickMe also provides corporate traveling solutions to businesses and organizations with the PickMe Business Portal, the benefits of which is currently enjoyed by over 150 corporates in the country.

## Title: Policy reforms vital for financial and economic discipline

Policy reforms vital for financial and economic discipline
The Presidential Commission Report on the Bond Scam of 2015, which was released in January 2018, is historic for a variety of reasons. Never in the history of Sri Lanka (probably in any other South Asian country) has a sitting governments alleged corruption been investigated to this depth during its own tenure. Secondly, never in the history of Sri Lanka has the Prime Minister of the country testified before such an Investigative Commission. Thirdly, never in the history of Sri Lanka has a Senior Cabinet Minister tendered his resignation due to the allegations against him in the Commission of Inquiry. Lastly, not the least, this is the father of all financial scams perpetrated in Sri Lanka to date.
While the Bond Scam and the long delay in removing the Governor of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka, who was alleged to be linked to the scam, is somewhat repugnant, the belated action taken by the President of Sri Lanka to appoint a Commission of Inquiry and actually carry-out its recommendations by initiating legal proceedings against the suspected perpetrators of the scam are laudable and indeed revolutionary for Sri Lankan standards of rule of law and democratic governance.
Legal action and policy reforms
Whilst the legal action against the culprits in order to recover the huge loss to the Exchequer is absolutely necessary, it is absolutely insufficient. The root cause of the scam and the enabling institutions of the scam have to be identified and remedial action should be taken so that such scams do not occur never again.
The foregoing actions have to be taken speedily to re-establish confidence in the rule-of-law in economic governance in the country and perfect competition in the financial market, which is sine qua non for attracting foreign investments to the country and for the success of the proposed Colombo International Financial Centre to be established in the reclaimed land from the sea adjoining the Colombo harbour through a Chinese foreign direct investment, which is the largest ever foreign direct investment in the country.
While the conclusion of the legal action against the culprits could take at least five years, policy reforms to prevent such scams in the future could be undertaken in much shorter time period if there is real and sufficient political will from at least the two main political parties in the country (such as the UNP and SLFP/SLPP). Whilst the Presidential Commissions of Inquiry primarily base their verdict on circumstantial evidence, such circumstantial evidence have to be proved beyond reasonable doubt for the successful prosecution of the accused in a Court of Law. For example, the judicial action against the suspects in the 2G Spectrum Scam (aka 2G Scam), claimed to be the worlds second largest abuse of executive power by the Time Magazine http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,2071839_2..., took almost eight years to conclude in December 2017, and more importantly all the accused were found not guilty because the prosecution could not prove that the accused were guilty beyond reasonable doubt.
Public funding of political parties for elections
It has been rumoured that the bond issue was committed partly due to election campaigns.
Under normal circumstances, political parties depended on wealthy businessmen for funding. This has also resulted in unholy alliances between business and politics.
In order to clean-up the financing of the political campaigns of political parties during election times, the state (through the Election Commission) should fund political parties for their political campaigns during election times based on a formula established taking into account the proportion of votes obtained in the past election/s by each and every political party. New political parties and independent groups could be funded through a different formula.
In order to minimise the cost of election campaigns to the exchequer and thereby to the taxpayers, the deposit money imposed on political parties and independent groups for contesting elections should be exponentially increased in order to minimise the number of political parties and independent groups contesting any election. Secondly, the Presidential election and the Parliamentary elections should be held on one and the same day, and the Provincial Council elections and local government elections should be held simultaneously on another day. The foregoing will minimise the number of election campaigns to be funded by the state and thereby minimise the cost to the taxpayers.
The public funding of election campaigns has the potential to encourage self-less educated and professional classes of people to contest elections, and thereby improve the quality of elected politicians in the country, who are presently put-off by the very high cost of election campaigns.
Reform of State-owned Banks and EPF/ ETF
It transpired during the course of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry, how the state-owned banks and financial institutions, and the Employees Provident Fund (EPF) and Employees Trust Fund (ETF) were abused/manipulated by the Central Bank in the great bond issue of 2015. Therefore, the privatisation of the state-owned banks and financial institutions (such as the Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation) and listing these financial institutions in the Colombo Stock Exchange is the sine qua non to prevent the abuse of executive power as happened in the case of the bond issue.
It is high time the trade unions in general, and the Ceylon Bank Employees Union (CBEU) in particular, should agree to the privatisation of state-owned banks and financial institutions and take the management of the EPF / ETF out of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka to prevent future abuses by the ruling political party and/or politicians.
The trade unions in Sri Lanka should evolve with the time if at all it wishes to be relevant and effective in the twenty-first-century economy. Globally, the capitalist mode of production has evolved irrevocably in the post-cold war era with the dispersion and atomisation of production processes through the global supply chains and it is high time the labour unions follow suit with its own evolution in order to remain relevant and effective in their services to the working people.
The state-owned commercial (e.g. Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank) and specialised banks (e.g. National Savings Bank) account for around seventy percent of the total bank deposits in the country, and the state-owned Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation is the single largest player in the insurance market. The EPF / ETF are captive sources of revenue for the government. Hence, the state effectively monopolises the financial sector in Sri Lanka. This monopolisation is the primary reason for fiscal profligacy by successive governments and ineffective and irrational monetary policies in the country. The unsustainable public debt portfolios in the past three decades are also a direct result of the monopolisation of the financial sector by the state.
Appointment of Governor of the Central Bank
The appointment of the Governor of the Central Bank should be made completely transparent with in-built wetting processes and should be based on a competitive process through public advertising in order to ingrain the independence of the Central Bank vis--vis the Executive and the government in power.
Though the great bond issue has negative consequences for the confidence in the financial sector of Sri Lanka in particular and indeed the economic governance of the country in general in the near term, the fact that the President had the audacity to institute a Commission of Inquiry and conclude it in a very short time followed-up by institution of legal action against the accused marks great strides made against bribery and corruption committed by powerful politicians (especially ruling party ones). It would greatly enhance the confidence in economic governance in the country in the medium and long terms.
This augurs well for attracting quality foreign direct investments on a competitive basis from advanced countries as opposed to current flows from emerging economies in Asia.
This extraordinary investigation of a scam perpetrated by the incumbent government was made possible because the President and the Prime Minister were from two different political parties. In order to ensure such exemplary judicial action in the future too, it should be made mandatory, constitutionally, that the President and the Prime Minister are from two different political parties.
However, much more needs to be done to cleanse the economy and polity of this country. The Presidential Commission of Inquiry and its aftermath is just the beginning of the long road ahead. By the way, the ghost of the past (2006 - 2014) is knocking the door in the aftermath of the just concluded local government elections. Is this, one step forward, two steps backwards

Pre planned strategies for product life cycle management
Any product launch need careful analysis at all stages to make it successful and to recover the returns in the planned manner. The business environment is extremely competitive and leaves no room for complacency. Any omission, commission or delay will affect the success of the subject matter. Pre planned strategies should be devised for each stage of product life cycle. Most products and services developers are usually neglecting the consideration of all vital key factors in their preliminary, secondary and final evaluation.
Some spend years in the design and planning stage. A good example of a common and easy to understand case is the making of a film. The film in the first instance need to have a story which has so far not being made use of by any film producer. In other words it should be a breakthrough story. Then the film producer should select the most appropriate and suitable director for this type of stories. To select the director, the producer should possess an in depth knowledge of the film industry for at least a decade, to make sound judgements on all aspects. Together with the director selected, the producer is required to select the most dynamic and versatile cast for the film. If required auditions should be preceded for each role preceding the selection of cast. Screenplay is another important aspect of the film and the screenplay should not make the viewers feel uninterested for even one single scene. The momentum should be kept upto the end of the film. Then comes the dialogue which need to match the roles of each member of the cast. Then the selection of the music director is also of significance. The background music and songs (if any) will add to the strength of the film. Amongst other things the type and quality of film production equipment and the skills of film crew also play a pivotal part. The most important angle of the film would be the film locations and studios to be selected. The film should be shot within the shortest possible time as film artistes and crew usually have other assignments in the industry. Finally, the censor board approval and film release dates be decided. The length of the film is also important as most viewers do not wish to spend more than 2  hours at the cinema. The modes of film advertising in both print and electronic media and the selection of film halls for simultaneous release will also be important factors. The film producer should target the maximum collections within the first 2 to 3 weeks from film release as the feedback from the film fans will spread. If the film is good and meets the requirements and expectations of the target audience the film will draw crowds over and above the target audience.
Total product life cycle inclusive of the planning and development stage is detailed below briefly.
* Specific product and service planning stage
* Product development stage
* Sensitivity analysis based on key factors
* Re-development of the product based on the results of sensitivity analysis
* Product launch
* Product acceptance
* Growth
* Maturity
* Competition by way of new and existing products
* Product innovation
* Product re-Launch
* Decline
* Obsolescence
* Market exit
* Dropout
This product life cycle is common in most products and services. Banks and financial instituitions can make a detailed study on each customer base products and services to determine the extent of success possible with a view of safe lending. Banking products and services need special attention.
Now let us look into summarized details of each module of product life cycle.
Specific planning stage
The entrepreneur is required to have a thorough knowledge and a deep insight into the product or service to be introduced into the market. It is ideal that the product and service should be a breakthrough product and service to catch the attention of the customers. In other words the product and service is not currently available in the market or the new product and service is available in the market at present is sold and serviced by a competitor. If the same product and service is introduced into the market under a different trade and brand name it may be necessary to spend a large sum of money for sales promotion and advertising to achieve the market leader or dominancy status or to achieve a fair market share.
Product development stage
This is the most important stage of the cycle and needs lot of research data and market acceptance reports of similar products and services. A technical analysis in all aspects will ensure a tried and tested product and service.
Sensitivity analysis based on key factors
This is required for building up the perfect model for the product or the service. The quality of the product at different denominations of key factors will ensure a low cost and high quality product at a good profit mark up continuously, to ensure the availability of product in the markets at all times.
Re-development of the project model based on results of sensitivity analysis
This process is known as the Stamping of class into the developed product or service.
Product launch
This is commonly known as the introduction stage. At a suitable time of the year the product and service should be launched. The ideal time would be a time where the consumer savings are higher and they possess the spending power to purchase. A successful launch covered by the media as well coupled with the production of a short promotional advertisements will be the beginning of the success road. The product is promoted vigorously to create awareness and develop markets for the product and service.
Product acceptance
To gain market acceptance all new products and services are required to spend a considerable part of their promotional costs in the first few weeks, to ensure large sales volumes and ready acceptance of the product and service to be launched in a majority of markets.
Growth
At this stage of the project, higher sales volumes are appearing and brand preference and increased market shares will be the result. In growth stage, firms seek to build niche markets.
Maturity
Consolidations in markets and market acceptances are at a very high level at this stage.
Competition by way of new and existing products and services
The competitors at this stage may well employ new strategies to get back their lost market shares.
To counter this threat, sufficient liquid funds are needed to tackle them head on, with similar or superior counter attack strategies.
The liquid funds should have been built up over a period from profits generated internally in anticipation of this threat.
Product innovation
Product specifications are tested again for a simple but an improved product or service in terms of technology, easier handling, cheaper with many added security features to catch the eye of consumers again.
Product relaunch
Re-launching will take place again at a time most opportune for the existing business. Launch of complimentary products may be more advantageous as both products will be made use of by the customers, that is the re-launched product and the complementary product. A higher combined profit could be achieved.
Decline
There may be a point at which superior and cost effective products will come into the market. These products may be imported ones or produced locally with superior technology by the competitors. At this stage it may be a strategic move to merge with another business house or to sell the existing business to them, unless the management is confident that further innovation is possible to counter the threats of competitors. The other option would be to shift markets.
Obsolescence
If the company fails to carry out further innovation or are unable to merge or sell the business, it will only be a matter of time before obsolescence arrives.
Market exit
Market exit is advisable after obsolescence without spending valuable resources on the product and service.
Drop out
Finally, total drop out will come. Staff cadres could be shifted to an inter company or found employment with external companies. In the alternative, compensation will have to be paid.
For each of the above stage mentioned above, alternative strategies could be designed to ensure that there will be many business alternatives at every stage of product life cycle. If manufacturing is involved, the manufacturing cycle should be reduced as far as possible with lower times for raw material procurements, factory production, selling and realizing the sales proceeds into cash. It is the cash flow that is important for the survival of any business. Sales volumes may be there at all times. However, the credit periods both inward and outward will decide on the availability of liquid cash within the company which will assist the company in the working capital management.
Let us now consider the practical cases of long term business survival and forward corporate march and product life cycle management in the long term.
The famous international drink coca cola is in Sri Lanka for over five decades and the consumers are assisting the company by being loyal to the brand, taste and the company itself. Only a few added features in packaging, like cans and mega bottles, have come in as value additions to the original product. In the case of our own Elephant brand soft drinks, the product range has been increased with additional quantities at same price. Elephant soft drinks are also in the market for a considerable time. Maliban and Munchee are two more consumer products who have been innovating their products and provided the consumers with high value all the time.
Diversification into other snack items has achieved commendable results. The local and overseas consumers are provided with a wider choice of quality products at affordable prices. They have successfully weathered the local and overseas competitors.
At the same time there were many other business ventures who had to cease functioning due to bad planning and non management of product life cycle at most vital times. For a successful management of product life cycle, a company will need excellent marketers, finance personnel, research and sales personnel, information technology and engineering staff to look into the components of the products and services with a view of cost cutting, engineering analysis and continuous edge over market competitors. BPO could be another method of cost control. Product life cycle should be jointly monitored by the directors and the top management to devise joint strategies to successfully prolong the product life cycle ousting the competitors at all times.
Though the product life cycle concept has been used successfully over the years, it has made marketers assume that there is only one trajectory for successful products. By viewing the product life cycle in the same way, marketers pursue similar positioning strategies for products and services during each stage of the life cycle. In the process, they miss out on opportunities to differentiate themselves and exploit Fortune favours the brave concept.
Cost of entry to domestic and overseas markets is very high and it is advisable to launch on new products and services with a sufficient liquid capital, sophisticated fixed assets and a clear vision. If the launch is unsuccessful and the product and service fails, bulk of the capital pumped in will be lost. In addition business name, brand and the goodwill of the company will suffer.
Given below is a checklist of points for consideration in deciding to launch a new product or service and the management of life cycle of same.
* Nature of product and service to be launched
* Target markets
* Patent rights
* Resources required
* Cost of market entry
* Market shares
* Profit margins
* Credit periods
* Availability of resources
* Means of reaching the customers in all markets
* Innovations possible later on
* Advantages and disadvantages vis a vis competitors
* Local and imported materials and expertise required
* Long term existence
* Direct and indirect taxes payable
Depending on the product and service and the competitors and the state legislation there could be other considerations as well. Many businessmen and companies have run into difficulty after launching new products and services due to incomplete pre evaluations of the product and service life cycles. As a result they had to exit the markets and forego the invested capital.

President calls for swift renovation of 2,400 irrigation tanks in Dry Zone
President Maithripala Sirisena instructed relevant authorities to expeditiously complete the renovation of 2,400 irrigation tanks in the Dry Zone.
Already, necessary steps have been taken in this regard and the President instructed that the renovation of small irrigation tanks should begin soon, so that the agriculture sector would not be hindered during adverse weather conditions.
President Sirisena gave these instructions while addressing the Special Coordination Committee Meeting of the Polonnaruwa district, at the Thamankaduwa Divisional Secretariat on Monday (26).
During the meeting, the progress of projects in the Polonnaruwa district, as well as future plans for the district, were discussed in detail. The special attention of the President was drawn to the construction of the Kidney Disease Hospital, Economic Centre and trilingual school.
Special attention was also paid to actions taken for the development of infrastructure facilities, including the education, health, roads and irrigation in the district.
The President further instructed officials to prepare plans to identify the development needs of the people of the respective areas and emphasised that this must be done without wasting public funds. The President was told of the problems faced by farmers, particularly in relation to the agricultural uses of water.
The President pointed out the importance of re-planning programmes implemented to uplift the livelihoods of the people in the district, according to the needs of the public, with clear criteria.
Special attention was paid to the problems of farmers, as well as to agricultural development in the district. The President apprised officials regarding issues related to the agricultural uses of water and pointed out the importance of providing information to farmers, through farmers organizations, about the remaining water levels of the reservoirs and irrigation tanks, so that they could plan their agricultural strategies accordingly.
Meanwhile, Rs. 29 million worth of equipment was distributed to 636 beneficiaries in the Welikanda and Dimbulagala Divisional Secretariat divisions, to uplift their livelihoods, at the premises of the Welikanda Divisional Secretariat.

President's SAITM solution should reach Supreme Court - GMOA
Any delay in informing the solution (enrolling all qualified SAITM students in KDU) to the Supreme Court will make the issue more and more complicated and serious. This solution given by the President should be informed to the Supreme Court immediately, the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday he said that there are five steps that should be taken by the President in order to make his solution a reality. The first step is issuing the gazette notification on abolishing SAITM. The second step is passing the Minimum Standard of Medical Education drafted by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) after gazetting it.
The third step is declaring the list of qualified SAITM students who are eligible to enroll in the Medical Faculty of Kothalawala Defence Academy (KDU). This should be done through a committee appointed by the SLMC and University Grants Commision (UGC).
The fourth step is appointing a technical committee consisting of Deans of State Medical faculties to decide what to do (required studies, training etc.) with qualified SAITM students who enroll in KDU and declare the programme to be implemented for them especially with required time duration, he said.
The solution including the technical facts should be presented to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General. As immediate temporary step, the President should inform his declared solution to the Supreme Court through the Attorney General. The GMOA will present the solution to the Supreme Court as a party of the ongoing Supreme Court case in connection with SAITM, he added.

## Title: Protecting Sri Lankas wetland ecosystems

Protecting Sri Lankas wetland ecosystems
A recent news story revealed that Colombo is literally drying up. Since the 1980s, the city has lost almost 60 percent of its wetland area. The news item would make anybody sad because Colombo was known in colonial times as the Garden City.
According to the authorities, for example, there are currently no wetlands left in Colombo from the extent between Beira Lake to the BMICH complex. Not long ago, there were enough of them! But theyve been replaced with multi-storied homes and high rises, office complexes and shopping centres, roads and landfills.
This situation is not confined to Colombo city alone. The majority of the wetlands in Sri Lanka are facing the same threats that are posed by harmful human activities.Unplanned reclamation, clearing of vegetation, organic pollution or chemical effluents, sewage disposal, garbage disposal, poaching (for consumption), ornamental fish or plant trade are the major threats.
These threats endanger species living in wetlands. Without healthy wetlands, this species can be lost to us forever.
These species are not the only ones that need healthy wetlands. We as citizens also rely on wetlands to naturally improve our waters quality and to store floodwater. The plants and natural bacteria found in a wetland can break up chemicals and make them less harmful to man and the environment. It then slowly releases the water back into the ground, allowing the water to replenish nearby aquifers and provide storage for floodwater.
Benefits
Wetlands, therefore, are incredibly valuable and productive ecosystems. Their functions benefit society in a number of ways. Flood control is one important function. Without a healthy wetland, flood water may not have a place to go, and could be forced to rush the excess water into nearby lakes and rivers.
Fish and wildlife habitat and shoreline erosion protection are two other functions.
In addition to these functions, wetlands, and the ecological diversity they provide, add beauty to any landscape and ideal for casual walks and relaxation Many individuals and organisations are also interested in wetland recreation activities such as wildlife watching.
Categories
Three general categories of wetlands are recognized in Sri Lanka: inland natural fresh water wetlands, salt water wetlands and man-made wetlands. Our fresh water wetlands include 103 river systems (covering more than 4500 km), the numerous lakes, marshes etc.
The salt water wetlands are located along the coastal belt with the exception of Wilpattu. The man-made water bodies referred to as wewas and it is said that Sri Lanka probably has the highest number of man-made water bodies in the world with an estimated total of more than 10,000 wewas countrywide. Both natural and man-made wetlands comprise about 15 per cent of the land area.
Wetland losses
Wetlands in Sri Lanka, as elsewhere are increasingly facing several anthropogenic pressures. The rapidly expanding urban population, large scale changes in land use/landcover, burgeoning development projects and improper use of watersheds have all caused a substantial decline of wetland resources of the country. Significant losses have resulted due to the threats from industrial, agricultural and various urban developments. These have led to hydrological disturbances, pollution and their effects.
The wetland loss can be divided into two broad groups namely acute and chronic losses. The filling up of wet areas with soil constitutes acute loss whereas the gradual elimination of forest cover with subsequent erosion and sedimentation of the wetlands over many decades is termed as chronic loss. Both types of losses are evident in Sri Lanka.
Since 77 percent of Sri Lankas population is rural and most of these people are resource dependent, these continuing losses can lead to predictable serious consequences in rural lifestyles.Healthy wetlands are essential in rural Sri Lanka for sustainable food production and potable water availability for people and livestock.
On the other hand, they are also necessary for the continued existence of our diverse populations of wildlife and plant species. We should remember that a large number of endemic species are wetland dependent.
Wetland loss is a long one-way street. Restoration of the converted wetlands is very difficult once these sites are occupied for non-wetland uses. Hence, the demand for wetland products (e.g., water, fish, wood, fibre, medicinal plants etc.) will increase with increase in population.
Coastal wetlands
When we study our coastal wetlands, it becomes clear that human activities have significantly altered coastal and marine habitat over the past few decades. This degradation and loss of habitat has significant economic and social consequences. For example, habitat degradation and loss has reduced the size and diversity of fish populations, which in turn has decreased opportunities for commercial and recreational fisheries. Human population who illegally live near the coasts, increase the pressures on coastal and marine habitat.
Many coastal wetlands have been identified as Essential Fish Habitat, indicating an increased urgency and value in protecting these areas. Using extensive scientific and management expertise, the Government authorities should take steps to avoid, minimize, and compensate for the adverse effects of dredging, fill, and other actions that threaten healthy coastal wetlands.
National wetland policy
In 2004, the Ministry of Environment and Natural Resources prepared the National Wetland Policy identifying six objectives: to protect and conserve wetland ecosystems, to prevent illegal utilization of wetlands, to restore and maintain the biological diversity and productivity of wetlands, to enhance ecosystem services from wetlands habitats, to assure sustainable use of wetlands and traditional practices by local communities; and to meet national commitments as a signatory to the Ramsar Convention.
It is time for the authorities to sit back and review the performance during the past 14 years  what went wrong and what was done successfully. They should decide whether tougher regulations and better enforcement will be needed to protect the wetlands in the face of increasing threats like infilling and pollution.
The authorities should also analyse the effectiveness of local government authorities management in wetlands and whether policy plan tools proved effective.
Different approach
The global experiences tell us that the transition to the ecosystem management approach needs a well-defined integrated decision-making approach. In this process, engagement with local people is critical.
The authorities should also consider the development of new higher supra-local government joint-management organisms such as Regional Action Plans, Special Plans of Conservation, and Public Consultation Forum etc.
Such organisms will be able to coordinate the responsible state and local authorities, develop an integral management of the wetland areas and involve stakeholders in the active management of these areas.
The participation of local people, both in the Public Consultation Forum and in joint management organisms, is a key factor to get them involved in management decisions. In addition, media-assisted knowledge dissemination activities can help people understand the values and benefits they obtain from water and wetlands.
On the brighter side, several government and non-profit agencies are working together presently to protect our wetlands from further destruction. Together, these organizations and the concerned citizens can make a difference in the future of our wetlands. As wetlands contribute to citizens health, economy, quality of life and the well-being of the natural environment, all of us as citizens should play our part in protecting them.

SLFP trying to wrest control of our bodies - SLPP
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party is attempting to wrest control of some local government bodies won by the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) by forging an alliance with the UNP, MP Dullas Alahapperuma said yesterday.
Addressing a press conference of the Joint Opposition group at the N.M.Perera memorial center at Borella, Allahapperuma said the SLFP General Secretary was behind an attempt to form an administration in 76 LG bodies jointly with the UNP.
He said although the SLPP has won all these LG bodies the party has narrowly failed to obtain an absolute working majority.
Alahapperuma also blamed the new calculating system at the LG polls to nominate candidates which he described was the reason for SLPP not obtaining a workable majority at some councils which it has won with a clear majority of votes.
He said that the Joint Opposition will seek legal redress for this anomaly and will soon file a case in court.However, Alahapperuma said out of the 76 LG bodies in question the SLPP was confident of obtaining a working majority in 36 bodies with the help of other parties and independent groups supporting it.

Sir John, Queen Elizabeth, Royal Astrologer & KDU:
Soothsayer spot on
In that short period of premiership -October 1953 to April 1956; following the resignation of honourable statesman Dudley Senanayake as PM, whose government mishandled the Hartal 53 killing nine rioters, Sir John Kothalawala was very much in the news. He planned a grand welcome to the Queen who was expected to visit with the Duke of Edinburgh.
Princess Elizabeth undertook a tour of British colonies on a long-planned international tour that covered Africa, Australia and New Zealand and Ceylon in February 1952.
The royal party was to visit us a month later, when one Sellaheva, a fairly well-known soothsayer declared that the Princess would never make it on the scheduled period according to the planetary positions that prevailed, a prediction that received wide publicity. Whilst enjoying a short break in Kenya en-route with Prince Philip the princess husband, her father, the 56-year-old King George VI had fallen ill.
The royal pair was relaxing at a game-viewing lodge in Nairobi. They spent the night surrounded by undomesticated animals. It was there that the princess became Queen after George VI passed away in his sleep. Her Majesty could not make her scheduled visit as she had to return home due to the sudden death of father proving Sellahevas forecast true. Sellahewa styled himself as royal astrologer, became a highly respected astrologer overnight. His services were sought by top politicians and rich businessmen for auspicious times and horoscope reading. Even before Princess was crowned in St Pauls Cathedral, our locals crowned Sellaheva as the undisputed King of Stars.
The Princess, now a Queen, in a rescheduled itinerary visited us in April 1954. The visit was a huge success. During her visit, PM Sir John advised Queen Elizabeth to appoint his friend Sir Oliver Goonetilleke as Governor-General in succession to Lord Soulbury. A conference of South-East Asian Heads of State was held in Colombo immediately after the royal visit.
This meeting was to lead to larger meetings at Bandung where Sir John was much in the news. During his premiership, in December 1955, we gained permanent membership of the United Nations Organisation. Scribes of the day named the PM, Hero of Bandung, for his great role at the summit.
A confident Prime Minister Sir John consulted Sellahewa and moved for an early dissolution in February 1956 although Parliament could have continued until 1957. Sellaheva rushed to predict a landslide victory for Sir Johns UNP at the general election which was fixed for April 1956. Bandaranaike had other ideas, Sinhala only in 24 hours. It became a great misfortune for the UNPwhen the party led by Kothalawala, the Hero of Bandung was reduced to just eight seats. SWRD Bandaranaikes coalition with Philip and Dahanayake won a landslide; SWRD became the Prime Minister, while the Royal Astrologer went missing for some time.
Queens Sigiriya climb
The famous anecdote that was doing rounds six decades ago was when the Queens skirt went up in the breeze as she climbed up the Sigiriya staircase constructed for the occasion.
Sir John who was just behind the royal couple had screamed at the press cameramen Click your cameras, you devils. The photographer himself narrated the story in the Sunday Observer years ago. According to him, the real Sinhala words spoken by carefree and jovial Sir John were down to earth.
Ganin Yakko -------- Ganin.
The SRI series registration
In his time, he was a favourite object for ridicule by cartoonists like Collettes and G S Fernando; and it was famously said that he giggled loudest when the joke was on him, a most admirable characteristic especially for those in the public eye.
The new SLFP regime after the 1956 victory in a surge of nationalistic passion commenced the Sri series for registration of vehicles instead of English letters. Sir John in a skilful trick had the coveted numbers 1 Sri 1 for his brand new Cadillac. This was followed by 2 Sri 2, 3 Sri 3 . For his cars and it was a fair amusement for the cartoonist. In One of Collettes cartoons, Sir John was in ceremonial attire getting into his limousine whilst his political opponent was shown to be pensively reflecting on the sight standing on the street. The cartoon carried the diction Only A Cad Lac that way.
During the battle for the general election in 1956, the contender in a paddy - growing area invited the Prime Minister to chair a meeting. Sir John, never discriminate on race, caste, creed or religion during his carrier, and was brave enough never talk about it. At the meeting, he was somewhat intoxicated. The production of delicious kitul hakuru was a cottage industry in this village. The government, a month ago had increased the price of sugar. During question time, a bold youngster yelled: Hamuduruwane, why have you increased the price of sugar Sir John staggered straight and shouted: Ayi, yako, umbata hakuru thiyenne! -Why, devil, you have jaggery!
Once he had invited the entire guild of cartoonists to bring some of the originals of their work at his Kandawala Bungalow, Ratmalana and entertained them with scotch and his usual egg hoppers. A selected few cartoons he got preserved in frames and hung them in his spacious office room.
That was the jovial and good spirit of Sir John Kotalawela.
Retirement
Sir John, after his first and only set back, decided to wish goodbye to politics and party leadership, spend his time mostly on his farm in Kent, England. In 1979 he donated his residence and the 48-acre Kandawala estate to the government for establishing a National Defence Academy. He served in the Volunteer Force joining the Ceylon Infantry in 1923 rising to be a Colonel. He was posthumously made Hon General by President JR Jayewardene. John Kothalawala was knighted in June 1948 and made a Privy Councillor in 1955.
He was back in Sri Lanka in the latter part of his life and following his death on October 2, 1980, the Defense Academy was opened. It was raised to university status and is presently the General Sir John Kotelawala Defence University [KDU] to which the present government has decided to absorb SAITM private medical students successfully ending a long disputeundoubtedly, a fitting tribute to the fearless third Prime Minister of Sri Lanka.

Sri Lanka cooperative assets peak at Rs. 3 Billion
The asset base of Sri Lankan cooperatives have increased to Rs. three billion (USD 18 Mn) and coops are no longer charitable but they too should now compete in the liberal market economy.
Cooperatives are no longer charitable organisations and they have to compete with other institutions in a liberalised market economy. Accordingly, Cooperatives may formulate proper strategic plans to sell their products and services, announced the Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen on February 26.
Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the launch of Asia Pacific Cooperative Development Conference by the International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) at Galadari Hotel Colombo on February 26. This is the first ever such ICA Conference to be held in Sri Lanka. In attendance were Regional Director of Asia Pacific Region of the International Cooperative Alliance Balu Iyer, Deputy Minister of Economic Affairs of Kyrgyz Republic Denair Inanalier, Chairman of the National Cooperative Council of Sri Lanka W. Lalith A. Peiris and visiting cooperative reps from 27 countries.
The two day sessions that conclude on February 29, shall be focusing on integrating Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) to cooperative systems. This series of ICA sub-regional conferences began last year with three already concluded (In Jordan for Central Asia, in Mongolia for East Asia, and in Philippine for South East Asia).
It is obvious that this conference has paid its attention to Socio-economic, cultural well-being, poverty, hunger, food conservation, environment conservation etc. The recommendations, proposals and conclusions of this conference could be implemented through the cooperative movement and be contributed to the sustainability in the region. At present discussions and activities are taking place around the world on SDGs due to their importance.
Similarly, global Co-operative movement will also find out ways and means to achieve SDGs through this largest Community based movement in the world said Minister Bathiudeen, and added: The Government and the Cooperative movement could jointly implement programmes to achieve SDGs successfully. I would like to emphasise further discussions about the recommendations and exclusions of the Ministers Conference are taking place and necessary action to implement them are being worked out. Cooperatives are no longer charitable Organisations and they have to have a considerable revenue to meet their expenses for their survival. As all of you are aware Cooperatives also have to compete with other institutions in a liberal market economy.
Accordingly Cooperatives may formulate proper strategic plans taking into consideration of market situation and competitiveness to sell their businesses and services.
The cooperative movement has tremendous strength to meet business challenges in the open economy and Sri Lankan cooperative sector is a good example which started 112 years ago. There are almost 14,500 cooperatives in various productions, services, SMEs, womens development, rural banking, insurance and farming sectors. Cooperatives are also now present in our FMCG retail sector in Sri Lanka through Coop City shops. Lankan cooperative assets are a huge USD 1.8 Billion with another USD one billion in savings. The membership in our cooperative system exceeds five million.
Regional Director of Asia Pacific Region of the International Cooperative Alliance Balu Iyer praised Sri Lankan cooperative stakeholders, and said: This conference brings together participants of previous three sub-regional conferences. This meeting is held with the support of the European Union. Discussions and presentations will take place in the coming two days on eradicating poverty, sustainable food system, improving access and protecting environment.
After this Asia Pacific sub-region meet in Sri Lanka concludes, two more sessions in other countries for the finalisation of the Colombo declarations are likely.

## Title: Sri Lanka has role in ridding world of nuclear weapons

Sri Lanka has role in ridding world of nuclear weapons
Sri Lanka does not have nuclear weapons. And like many small countries around the world, it probably never will. But as the threat of nuclear warfare reaches Cold War levels, Sri Lanka could play a role in getting rid of the worlds stockpile of nuclear weapons.
Sri Lanka, along with 121 other countries, adopted the Treaty on the Prohibition of Nuclear Weapons, at the United Nations in July 2017.
The historic treaty, which was opposed by the worlds major nuclear powers, bans the possession, testing, stationing, use, and threat of use of nuclear weapons.
The intended effect of the ban is to increase the moral pressure for all countries to get rid of their nuclear arms, said Professor Ramesh Thakur of the Australian National Universitys disarmament programme and Asia-Pacific Leadership Network, at a lecture in Colombo earlier this month.
What the non-possessor states can do is to stigmatize the very possession of nuclear weapons and to delegitimize the possession and threat of use of nuclear weapons, he said. So far, only five of the 122 countries that adopted the treaty at the UN have ratified it. Sri Lanka has neither signed nor ratified the treaty since adopting it last year. We are at a particularly critical juncture in world affairs, Professor Thakur said. I think we are in danger of sleepwalking our way into a nuclear disaster.
Nuclear tipping point
The threat of nuclear war appears to be growing, not shrinking.
The famous Doomsday Clock now stands at two minutes to midnight. The clock, which has been maintained since 1947 by the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists, tracks how close the world may be to nuclear catastrophe, or midnight.
The last time the clock stood at two minutes  the closest the minute hand has ever been to midnight  was in 1953.
The bulletin said it moved the clock up this year because of the progress of North Koreas nuclear programme, the increasingly heated rhetoric from the United States, and tension between major nuclear powers like the US and Russia, China and the US, and India and Pakistan.
In the South Asian context, both India and Pakistan are actively testing missile technology, and disarmament talks are at a near halt, according to Professor Sadia Tasleem, of the Department of Defence and Strategic Studies at Quaid-i-Azam University in Pakistan.
The space for disarmament debate is also shrinking, she said at a recent public forum in Colombo.
The risk that nuclear weapons may be used - intentionally or because of miscalculation - grew last year around the globe, the Bulletin of the Atomic Scientists said in its annual report. This is a dangerous time, but the danger is of our own making.
Nine countries now possess around 15,000 nuclear weapons. The United States and Russia have the largest arsenals by far, with 6,800 and 7,000 warheads, respectively.
According to the International Campaign to Abolish Nuclear Weapons, which won the 2017 Nobel Peace Prize, the US and Russia maintain about 1,800 nuclear weapons on high-alert status, meaning they are ready to be launched within minutes.
The rest of the worlds nuclear warheads are held by France, the United Kingdom, China, India, Pakistan, Israel, and North Korea.
If any of these countries used their weapons against each other, there would be deadly effects felt around the world.
A single nuclear bomb detonated over a large city could kill millions of people, according to the campaign.The use of tens or hundreds of nuclear bombs would disrupt the global climate, causing widespread famine.
Professor Thakur, who served as an advisor to the Australian and New Zealand governments on arms control and disarmament, said the old model for maintaining peace, known as deterrence, has proven ineffective.
The deterrence theory rests on the assumption that world powers that hold nuclear weapons will not attack each other, or each others allies, based on mutually-assured destruction. A nuclear attack on an enemy would basically guarantee destruction at home from retaliatory attacks.
But the historical record is actually quite sceptical of the utility of nuclear deterrence, Thakur said. He argued that the ownership of nuclear weapons has not reduced aggression in geopolitical conflicts: the Soviet Union, for example, expanded its control into Eastern Europe when the United States had a monopoly of nuclear weapons in the 1940s.
Non-possession by the Soviet Union did not deter them from expanding, he said.
He said military defeats of the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, and the United States in Vietnam, showed that nuclear powers were unable to convert that nuclear monopolyinto any battlefield utility.
A bit like the emperor with no clothes, maybe its time to call out the nuclear emperor for being naked, he said.
He also argued that deterrence theory doesnt account for accidents, such as an accidental launch or seizure by terror groups.
And those threats may be less abstract than we think. The American investigative reporter Steve Coll, for a recent book, obtained documents from Indias external intelligence service showing that they believe the Pakistani naval frigate Zulfiqar contained a nuclear warhead at the time it was attacked by Al Qaeda in 2014.
The attack was successfully thwarted, but the proximity of a non-state terror group to obtaining a nuclear weapon is frightening.
The solution instead lies in nuclear disarmament, Thakur said.
Disarmament attempts
The major nuclear powers took a first step towards disarmament in 1968, with the signing of the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT).
The basis of the non-proliferation treaty was that non-nuclear weapons states would never acquire nuclear weapons, while nuclear states would agree to share information on peaceful nuclear technology, while pursuing disarmament.
But critics think the usefulness of the treaty has run out.
Since the NPTs entry into force, another four countries have acquired nuclear weapons, Thakur said. Israel, India, Pakistan, and North Korea.
And although the sheer amount of nuclear weapons has been reduced through bilateral agreements, the threat of nuclear war is higher than it has been in years. The net conclusion is that perhaps the NPT is perhaps no longer fit for purpose, Thakur said.
For this reason, many activists hope the newly adopted nuclear ban treaty will achieve the unfulfilled goals of the old treaty.
The worlds major nuclear powers, the United States and Russia, explicitly opposed the nuclear ban treaty.
After it was adopted, the US, the UK, and France issued a joint statement saying the ban disregarded the realities of the international security environment, and that they did not intend to sign, ratify or ever become party to it.
Professor Thakur argued that the adoption of the ban itself shows the increasing power of non-nuclear states given voice in the UN General Assembly, and that increased pressure on the international platform can have tangible effects.
Although 56 countries have signed the nuclear weapon ban treaty, only five have ratified it. It needs 50 ratifications to come into force.
Im confident theyll come, Thakur said.
That said, I think the normative impact will be much stronger once that number climbs to approximately 100, he added. A majority of states in the international community taking a firm position against nuclear weapons would break a psychological threshold, he argued.
Asked why Sri Lanka has neither signed nor ratified the ban, Foreign Ministry spokesperson Mahishini Colonne said that the matter is under active consideration by the relevant authorities, and Sri Lanka supports the Treaty in principle.
South Asian perspectives
Experts from around the world agree that non-proliferation and disarmament need a new strategy. The non-proliferation treaty has reached the end of its success, said Rakesh Sood, Indias former Ambassador to the Conference on Disarmament in Geneva. He was speaking at a forum at the Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute.
The only certain way to achieve peace, he said, is through nuclear disarmament. Sri Lankas former Foreign Secretary and former Permanent Representative to the United Nations, H.M.G.S. Palihakkara said the old non-proliferation treaty had allowed nuclear countries to maintain their status without consequence.
The existing nuclear countries want to lock in their status and de-legitimize everybody elses, he said.
Even though Sri Lanka is a small island, it has a role to play in the geopolitical arena, said University of Colombo Dean Nayani Melegoda.
As a small non-nuclear state, we cannot afford the prospect of nuclear conflict in the Indian Ocean region, she said.
Sri Lanka should use its historical links between its broader non-aligned foreign policy and nuclear non-proliferation and disarmament, she said.
If Sri Lanka signed and ratified the nuclear ban treaty, it would bring the number of states that have, up to six. Its not many, but the anti-nuclear activists argue that for every state like Sri Lanka that ratifies, the pressure increases.

Surrogate for daughter-in-laws Baby
Kayla Jones, 29, married her husband in 2012 with the knowledge that she would never be able to become a mum and would need to use a surrogate to carry their future children.
According to a story published in The Independent, the woman from Texarkana Arkansas was unable to carry her own child after she underwent partial hysterectomy at 17 but always harboured the hope of becoming a biological mum with her husband.
But after several other surrogacy options didnt work out, Kayla took her mother-in-law, Patty Resecker, up on her offer - a decision Kayla couldnt have been more thrilled about.
According to Kayla, who shared her story on LoveWhatMatters, her mum-in-law always joked about being their surrogate. After a couple of their surrogate options did not work out, they started to take her mother-in-law more seriously.
Despite originally finding the idea crazy, Kayla started researching the concept and found other instances where grandmothers had acted as surrogates.
The couple and Patty began undergoing tests to see if Patty was capable of carrying the child - and it turned out that she was actually a match. Using the IVF process, Patty successfully became pregnant in May 2017 - after the second embryo transfer, a day Kayla described as the second best day of my life.
The couple ended up surprising Patty with the results in a moving video that marked the beginning of their journey to parenthood.
And seven months later on December 30 2017, Patty, Kayla, and her husband welcomed baby Kross Allen Jones.
Speaking about the decision to serve as her daughter-in-laws surrogate, Patty, 50, said she felt blessed.
Speaking to LoveWhatMatters the grandmum said, Ive recently had the privilege of doing one of the most rewarding things: to carry my own grandchild for my son and daughter-in-law. This is something that has blessed not only me and my family, but also Kaylas family.

Textiles to lead Lankas export revival in 2018 - OBG Group
Sri Lankas apparel and textile export segment is likely to experience the highest rate of growth and would be the key driver towards Sri Lankas 2020 export earnings target of $ 20 billion.
A survey by Oxford Business Group (OBG) Business Barometer with CEOs who took part in a face-to-face survey predicted that the garments industry would be the growth engine for exports in the year ahead, followed by tea and spices at a distant second with 14%. Textiles and tea are the backbone of Sri Lankas tradable sector, respectively comprising 47% and 12% of total exports in 2016.
Asia Regional Editor, OBG, Patrick Cooke, says that under President Maithripala Sirisenas National Export Strategy, ICT, wellness tourism, spice concentrates, boat building, processed food and beverages, and electronics,machinery were identified as the six priority areas for diversifying the countrys export base.
While diversification will certainly contribute to meeting the governments bold targets, it is clear that local business leaders expect traditional industries to underpin growth for the foreseeable future.
Export industries received a welcome boost in May 2017, when the EU reinstated Sri Lankas Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+) status, which had previously been rescinded over human rights concerns in 2010. GSP+ status removes the majority of import duties on Sri Lankan goods entering the European single market, and likely drove the 13.8% year-on-year increase in garment exports to the EU in November 2017.
Even though the immediate future looks bright for the garments segment, Sri Lanka would be wise to devise adaptation strategies for technological advancements in manufacturing processes. Developments in innovative areas such as 3D printing and robotics are likely to erode some of the countrys current competitive advantages in the years to come, as without the need for lower labour costs, clothing giants may start to move production facilities closer to their main consumer markets.
Commenting on the future outlook for Sri Lanka the report says that Lanka should look towards successfully transitioning into a productive knowledge-based economy while still honoring debt commitments. The sustained pursuit of an open trade policy to attract value-added industries with accompanying skills transfer, as well as efforts to enable small and medium-sized enterprises to integrate into global and regional supply chains, will aid this endeavour. Being situated between the Middle East and Asia, with close proximity to the emerging economic superpower of India, the opportunities presented by the nations strategic geographic position should not be overlooked either.
At the same time, the country may benefit from opening the higher education system to private and international investment, though this will entail overcoming domestic opposition. This could help prevent the brightest minds from pursuing academic studies overseas and would introduce new approaches to creative thinking and entrepreneurship, which may ultimately lead to the creation of more high-value jobs at home.
Effectively countering the persisting brain drain will also require a coherent strategy to address the slide in female participation in the labour force, in turn enabling Sri Lanka to harness the full potential of its society.

The ultimate act of loyalty
A German Shepherd named Captain, who did no leave his master's grave for a decade, recently died at the same spot where the man is buried.
The 15-year-old dog has lived at the side of his owner's grave in the Municipal Cemetery of Villa Carlos Paz, a city in the Argentinian state of Cordoba, The Sun reported.
Miguel Guzman had bought Captain as a gift for his 13-year-old son Damian in 2005. Sadly the next year Guzman passed away. Captain went missing when his family returned home from the funeral.
Guzman's family assumed he ran away, but were surprised to find out where he had gone. It is unclear how Captain even found his master's grave.
"He turned up here one day, all on his own, and started wandering all around the cemetery until he eventually found the tomb of his master, " Hector Baccega, director of the the cemetery, is quoted as saying by The Sun. Baccega also revealed he sometimes used to wander around the cemetery during the day, but was back at the grave at 6p.m. every night.
When he was taken to the vet some time ago, it was discovered he had kidney faliure. "Unfortunately, his age and this condition (kidney failure) meant he could not hold on, " Cristhian Sempels, the vet who treated him told reporters, she thought it best to treat him in the cemetery than at a veterinary surgery.
His burial details are not yet known. Some have suggested he be cremated so its ashes can be placed in an area where locals can pay tribute to this beloved dog.

A voice never forgotten
Rukmini Devi was born on February 29, 1904, in an orthodox Brahmin family. Her father was Nilakanta Sasthiri, a Sanskrit scholar and civil engineer and the mother was Sheshambal. She also hailed from a musician family from Thiruviyaru. Her father Nilakanta Sasthiri induced her from the tender age to follow theosophical society activities. Due to that, she was in contact with numerous scholars including Dr George Arundale.
In 1919, she lost her father. Later in 1920, she married Dr Arundale who was 24 years elder to Rukmini Devi, despite stiff resistance from the orthodox Brahmin family. With Dr George Arundale she travelled to Europe and propagated the Indian culture.
Exceptional skills
Further, while she was in Australia she met Russian ballerina Anna Pavlova. There she learnt dancing under Cleo Nordic. Due to the suggestion and advice of Anna Pavlova, she started learning her own traditional art under the Meenakshi Sundaram Pillai. She also leant dancing under Mylapore Gowri Amma and Muthukumar Pillai. Her first performance took place in 1935 at the Theosophical Society. In 1939, she went on a tour to entire South India to propagate dance. In 1945, her husband Dr Arundale died.
Once she said that Anna Pavlova was her spiritual guru who really induced her in the dancing career. She founded Kalashethra on January 6, 1936. Today Kalashethra has gained worldwide recognition. It produced a considerable number of danseuses. In the Bharatha Natyam field, she was awarded numerous prestigious awards for her immeasurable contribution to the art. Mostly Kalashethra produced dance drama from 1944 to 1979.
In 1956 Padma Bhushan award was presented to her by the president of India. In 1957 Sangeetha Natak Academy awarded her the Best Dancer award. Sadir was the origin of Bhartha Natyam. When Sadir was in an extinguished position. Rukmini Devi Arundale rescued the art and revived it. Until she entered the dance field, Tamil classical dance was practised and preserved by Devadasis and the Isai Vellalar clan. She was the first to prove that the dance could be practised by all including the Brahmin caste and high-class section of society. Bharatha Natyam is a divine art which helps the soul to attain salvation. She was the first one who danced for the famous music trios songs of Thyagaraja, Muthuswami Tikshakar and Siyama Sasthiri.
Musical collaborations
She started the institution Kalashethra with the help of her niece Radha Burnier who was her first student. Later, many good dance teachers and musicians joined the organization. Especially, Panda Nallur great gurus joined the Kalashethra. Among them were Pantha Nallur Chokalingam Pillai and Panda Nallur Dandayuthapani Pillai. They followed the Panda Nallur style and joined the institution to teach Bharatha Natyam.
Besides these, she got the assistance of some outstanding musicians such as Mysore Vasudevachariyar, Karaikudi Sambasiva Iyer and Papanasa Sivan to develop the music section of Kalashethra. All of them composed melodious musical compositions for her own idealistic dance compositions. She also got the assistance to learn and understands Sanskrit from scholars in order to understand the Natya Sastra.
Ambu Panickar and Chandu Panickar were employed to teach Kathakali. Later Varadachachariar, Modikondan Venkadarama Ayyar, Papanasam Sivan, Kalidas Nilakanta Ayyar, Vasudevadevachariar and Madurai Subramaniya Ayyar were engaged to teach her classical music at Kalashethra. The Veena was taught by Karaikudi Samasiva Ayyar and Veena Krishnamachariar. And Krishnamurthi Sasthiri was engaged to teach Gottuvadyam.
Upholding standards
More or less Smt. Rukmini Devi choreographed more than25 dance dramas. Kalidass Kumara Sampavam, Jega Devas Githa Govintham, Ramayanam, Valmikis Ramayanam, Mahapattabishekam, Chudamani Pradanam, and Sitha Suyamparam are some of her own outstanding dance dramas. All the productions of Kalashethra dance dramas were of high standards.
With the passage of time, all the dance schools started following and producing numerous dance dramas based on epics. Mostly Kalashethra produced dance dramas during the period of 1944to 1979.In 1960 the Wayne State University of the U.S.A awarded a Doctorate in Humanities to her. In 1968 the Sangeetha Natak Academy gave her a fellowship.
Similarly, in 1969, 1972, 1980 and 1982, doctorates were awarded to her by Rabinthra Barathi University, Calcutta, Vishwa Bharathi University Santhiniketan, Tamil Nadu Eyal Isai Nataka Mandram and Benares Hindu University.
Madya Pradesh Government conferred the Kalidas Samman title on her. From 1952 to 1962 she served as a member of the Rajya Sabha (Upper House of the Indian Parliament). In 1977, she was invited to serve as the President of India, which she politely declined. Her life ended on 24 February 1986, but her service rendered to the art world will never end. The entire Bharatha
Natyam world will always remember her tremendous service to art. And also the whole world will salute her lifelong contribution to the Bharatha Natyam, and her efforts to get the worldwide recognition and fame.

Walsh seeks consistency from Bangladesh in Sri Lanka tri-series
DHAKA : Bangladesh interim coach Courtney Walsh said Tuesday he would be pushing his side for consistency in next month's tri-nations series in Sri Lanka after a string of poor finishes.
The former Caribbean fast bowling great, usually a pace instructor for Bangladesh, is stepping up in the absence of a coach for the Twenty20 tournament.
Bangladesh lost a tri-nation tournament at home last month despite a strong start, before losing a series-deciding Test match against Sri Lanka inside three days.
Walsh, who has been working with Bangladesh's bowlers since 2016, said the side lacked consistency, not talent.
If we can get consistent, we will be happy. It is going to be the biggest challenge and it is something that I will be stressing on a lot, he told reporters.
Bangladesh have been without a head coach since October when Chandika Hathurusingha, a former Sri Lankan batsman, quit after three years to join his struggling home team.
Former skipper Mahmud filled the void as team director recently, when Bangladesh lost a Test and Twenty20 home series against Sri Lanka.
Walsh said he had not needed a long discussion to take up the offer.
Once the opportunity came, it wasn't anything too difficult to discuss. I want to improve what we are doing here and hopefully take up a challenge, he said.
The 55-year old former West Indies captain, who was once Test cricket's leading wicket-taker with 519 scalps, said his role would be more that of a mentor than a coach.
It is going to be like a father figure, to give them the confidence, he said.
The competition, which has been organised to mark Sri Lanka's 70th independence anniversary, will run from March 6-18 in Colombo.
India are the other team in the tournament.

## Title: Will Nidahas series lose its sheen sans Kohli & Co

Will Nidahas series lose its sheen sans Kohli & Co
Both India and Bangladesh have named their squads for next months Nidahas trophy T20 tri-series to celebrate Sri Lankas 70th year of Independence, but some of the big names are missing especially in Indias line-up which could take the sheen off the tournament.
T20 is especially associated with India whose Indian Premier League (IPL) has produced some outstandingly talented cricketers for them across all formats.
However with the amount of international cricket India is playing today the Indian Cricket Board to prevent player burn out has rested as many as six regulars namely Virat Kohli the Indian captain, former captain MS Dhoni and exciting young players like Hardik Pandya, Kuldeep Yadav, Bhuvneshwar Kumar and Jasprit Bumrah  all match winners on their day.
Rohit Sharma has been handed the task of leading India in the absence of Kohli and the team apart from Sharma comprises seven players who helped India complete a 3-0 whitewash of Sri Lanka in the three-match T20I series in India last December. On that occasion too Kohli was rested and Sharma led India.
The seven players are: Lokesh Rahul, Manish Pandey, Dinesh Karthik, Jaydev Unadkat, Yuzvendra Chahal, Washington Sundar and Mohammad Siraj.
However India has included batsmen Shikhar Dhawan (who will be vice-captain to Sharma) and Suresh Raina  both of whom didnt figure in the series against Sri Lanka. A player of Rainas quality has not been able to guarantee a regular place in the Indian side having appeared in only six T20I for his country in the past two years.
Such is Indias talent that even without some of the big guns like Kohli and Dhoni they are still a strong unit to go and win the Nidahas trophy. So neither can Sri Lanka nor Bangladesh treat them lightly just because some of their key players have been rested.
India of course will find Sri Lanka a totally different side from the one they played three months ago. On that occasion Sri Lanka were drifting in stormy seas like a ship without a rudder and suffered a battering from all sides. With the arrival of Chandika Hathurusingha as head coach in December, the Lankan team seems to have settled into a match-winning unit as was displayed in their recent tour to Bangladesh where they won across all three formats defeating the hosts in the one-day tri-series final, the Test series and in the T20I series.
Hathurusinghas presence in the dressing room and at practices has given the team renewed confidence and belief to win and bring the best out of the players which was something that was amiss in the recent past.
Shikhar Dhawan is one player who foresaw Sri Lankas improvement in the near future. In his assessment of the Lankan team in August last year Dhawan who had powered India to a thumping nine-wicket win in the first ODI at Dambulla said, This is a young side and they are in transition period where all the boys will mature. In international cricket you need to have that experience. The young boys are good and with time they will get better thats what I feel.
Even South African-born fielding coach Nic Pothas who was trusted into the position of interim head coach following Graham Fords resignation said that he could bring about a turnaround of the teams fortunes if given a free hand.
For me, if we were left alone and you could work with this group of players, you could get some stability and consistency over six months, youd see massive improvements. These are seriously gifted players.
It was a statement which Pothas was to retract less than 48 hours later apparently under pressure from Sri Lanka Cricket with the words: We are in good shape at the moment, a couple of very good training days and the boys are in very good spirits. We are very much focused on the process of policies and procedures that are in place which would stand us in good stead into the future.
If Sri Lanka Cricket has learnt its lessons from the past they would do well to let Hathurusingha run the show the way he thinks is best for the team. He has already shown his hand that without outside interference and pressure he can deliver the goods.
Hathurusinghas presence is not only a shot in the arm for the national cricket team but a lifeline for the present set of administrators whose survival and the chance of being re-elected to office for another two-year term depends heavily on the national teams performances which before his arrival had sunk to its lowest level. Hathu is the savior not only for the Lankan team but for Sri Lanka Cricket in general.
