Way of the World
Everyone born into this world wishes to be happy. And so people are continually searching and striving for their happiness. It has been like this since we were little. Even before we can speak properly, we are already seeking things to satisfy us. As small children, we express our wants through our studies and acquire as much knowledge as possible so we can get a good job. We assume that having a good job and earning a lot of money which make us happy and at ease.
These words quoted from the English translation of a series of Thai Dhamma talks delivered by Ajahn Anan Akincano are titled as The World and the Heart. As a reader, I found the five discourses as translated into English are full of spiritual insights packed with varying types of Dhamma anecdotes resembling the Zen type of tales and dialogues akin to versified dictums as delivered by Venerable Ajahn Chah with whom Ajahn Anan had been a close associate, a student and a personal assistant.
Ample examples
Proceeding from the known facts of the day to day life, Ajahn Anan takes the reader (or the listener in the first instance) to a world of multiple activities, where the innermost understanding is made to be clear with ample examples. Instead of propagating a strict rule or dogma in Dhamma, Ajahn allows the respondent to see the way of the world and to realise how it affects individuals. He says this is the way of the world and this is how it has always been.
Sentence by sentence, the respondent is allowed to think and interpret for oneself where he or she stands in the way of the world. This he says: When we are gone, a new generation emerges. It will be like this for them as well. As such, nothing changes. Then comes the paradoxical statement that goes as though we are born and others follow into this world, we fail to see the world.
The discourse continues as a stream. We become addicted to the ways of the world. What is meant to be an addiction is then exemplified.
We are addicted to forms, sounds, smells, flavours and tactile sensations. Given thought to these factors, the inevitable question is whether they last. These dont last as the world changes. Arising and ceasing, they undergo change and transformation over time. Followed by these, Ajahn Anan states:
For this reason, the Buddha cautioned his disciples in the following words: Look at the world beautiful and enticing like a royal chariot. Those without wisdom are bound by the world. But those who know are not bound.
Interspersed understanding
This explanation culminates in the teachings of the concept of captivating wisdom known in the canon as panna or pragna. This is explained as a great form of understanding interspersed with the two main factors of sila and samadhi. The precepts may look high flown or laid down as untraceable by the common folk. But the respondent is made to follow them devoid of barriers based on simple practices.
These practices include the taming of the mind commencing from simple meditations to higher forms gradually laid down in other chapters. The reader-respondent is made to be aware of the ways of the world as a conclusive measure as follows: During the course of one day, there is endless arising and ceasing. If one sees the nature of these thoughts and feelings as they arise and cease this means that we see the world.
As the next interlinked discourse the reader is made to perceive Finding the Path which deals mainly with the concept as laid down in four lines that go as follows:
Sabba papassa akaranan (refraining from all wrongdoing)
Kusalassa upasampada (bringing goodness to perfection)
Sachittapariyo Dapanan (making the mind pure and unblemished)
Etam Buddhanasasanan (these are the teachings of all the Buddhas)
Noble path
In order to exemplify the teachings of all Buddhas, Ajahn takes the eight steps as laid down in the Noble Path known as Arya Ashtangika Magga (Noble Eight-fold Path). Though the average layman knows about this path, the inner layers could be well interpreted and analysed based on the wisdom one had gained. What is simply taught come to mean in a simple question raised: do you know what you are doing Are you doing the right thing If you do the right thing, you will reach a sanctity so far unreached. But if you do the wrong thing you will fall into a dismal state, perhaps unknown to you. This is explained as light and dark. Who likes to be in darkness It is the light of wisdom one needs.
In the chapter titled as From Wisdom, Freedom, some of the teachings of the prophetic Zen type storyteller Ajahn Chah are laid down as examples to clarify some Dhamma dogmas. In one instance, it is recorded that when the new ordination hall at Wat Non-Pah Pong developed cracks in the cement, a layman had come to inform Ajahn Chah. Thats right, he told the layman.
If the hall didnt crack like this, there wouldnt have been a Buddha! You see These things are impermanent. It is just natural  no matter how well built they change according to causes and conditions.
Then it is stated that thought the venerable monk had stated in that manner, he had not discouraged any repair as a measure to amend it.
Interesting anecdotes
More Zen type anecdotes follow in order to exemplify simple teachings in a creative manner that could be perceived by the common folk. Once a discourse comes to be on the precept and practice. Some monks from South Korea had come to see Ajahn Chah. One question raised happens to be: Why do we need to practice What is the purpose of practice How should we practice What result can we expect from practice
The Zen type answer on the part of Ajahn Chah had been like this.
Why do we need to eat
Lets all think about this.
Why do we need to eat
Whats it for
How do we go about eating and once we have eaten, what is the result
This is how he answered and they understood.
In this manner, the series of talks takes the reader on the way for the world and the heart.

We will protest against lifting ban on glyphosate: GMOA

We will launch a massive protest jointly against governments decision to lift the ban imposed on using glyphosate weedicide for tea and rubber plantations, said Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Nalinda Herath.
Expressing his concern on local citizens health he told Daily News Online, even though this weedicide may help to gain more crops and hence gain more economic benefits to the said industries, it is very unhealthy.
In a previous press conference held on April 11, the GMOA stated that they believe glyphosate causes cancer and kidney deceases.
When it was inquired from Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake as to why a health hazardous chemical was approved to be allowed for the top two commercial crops in Sri Lanka, the Minister said that these statements made by the GMOA are false.
Glyphosate is not hazardous, the Minister said and added, It has been proven by the World Health Organization (WHO) and it is a two way carcinogen.
Last November the world's largest study on the health effects of glyphosate covering over two decades and involving 90,000 people, found no harmful effects even on applying powerful statistical analysis to scrutinise the data, the Journal of the National Cancer Institute (JNCI)said.
Furthermore the Minister said in response to GMOA who alleged that government politicians are carrying out personal agendas for personal gain, that it is the GMOA who is aligning their claims according to agendas of other anti-government movements.
However the ban which was imposed on utilizing glyphosate was lifted this afternoon on tea and rubber industries, by the government.

The present government is destroying the workers rights one by one which is evident from the denial to celebrate the Workers Day on May 1, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was speaking at the T.B Ilangarathna commemoration ceremony.
The May Day rally of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna which will be held in Galle would be a massive success. We havent invited the 16 SLFP members yet. But, there is plenty of time to invite them, Rajapaksa said.
The present government cannot rescue this country from the mess it is in by any reshuffle, Rajapaksa said when inquired about his views on the Cabinet reshuffle.

## Title: Yasodhara: pride of Buddhist womanhood

Yasodhara: pride of Buddhist womanhood
The most dedicated woman in the history of womanhood, Yasodhara has been the companion of the Bodhi Sathva for five hundred and fifty births in the samsara. She was instrumental in the Bodhi Sathvas life, to fulfil the aspiration of becoming the Buddha, the Enlightened One! From the period of Deepankara Buddha, she had the courage and the determination to fulfil her vision. She became Prince Siddharthas queen in his last birth and encouraged him to follow the path.
All this is legendary and scriptural. The sacrifices made by her during the long journey of samsara are not comparable to the role of Maya or Prajapathi Gothami.
Colossal production
Professor Sunil Ariyaratnes visualisation of Yasodharas character is also a tedious task. Yasodhara is a character living in the minds of Buddhists in the past- present- and even in the future. We see a huge number of references made by Professor Ariyaratne in his title cards of the film. Hence his visualization on the large screen is a colossal production. H D Premasiri the producer has taken a huge risk in the Sri Lankan film industry.
The Director employs a Puraka or a narrator in the form of a bard (a brilliant performance by Thumindu Dodanthenna) who makes frequent appearances on the screen. Professor Ariyaratne himself being a great lyricist uses his poetic prowess for characterization.
The filmmaker, apart from visualizing, meticulously chooses dialogues to glorify the legendary lady. The dual portrayal is meant to conquer the minds of Buddhist audience, especially the mass audience. At times it is heartening - bringing tears to the eyes of the audience - who are well aware of Yasodharas sacrifices!
Yasodhara is a family film that underlines ups and downs of a princess who is striving to achieve the supreme bliss!
Mark of respect
Prince Siddhartha is well aware of this plight. That is why after attaining Buddhahood, he allows Yasodhara to pay obeisance in her own way! Not only that, but the Blessed One visits her chamber as a mark of respect for her sacrifices. He makes reference to her companionship through five hundred and fifty births as laid down in the Buddhist literature.
The filmmaker visualizes this particular moment with pomp and pageantry. Yasodhara shows the Enlightened One to her son, Prince Rahula, with the Naraseeha Gatha being chanted in the background. The director uses a painting to elaborate her feelings. So the outcome soon follows. Prince Rahula is ordained by the Buddha. Prince Siddharthas father opposes it! And then a Vinaya rule is introduced to the Buddhist tradition: parental permission is a must before ordaining a child.
Yasodhara also follows the path of Buddha and attains the bliss of Nibbana. Her brother Devadatta is up in arms against the sequence of events. The filmmaker seems to have highlighted the character of Devadatta. This portrayal seems to harm the serenity of the films mood.
The Indian actors portrayal of Prince Siddhartha and Princess Yasodhara is satisfactory though not powerful. Extravagant costumes, colourful done sets and every minute detail is given importance. Thus Yasodhara can be viewed as an extraordinary creation. Compared to Ariyaratnes earlier films, Uthpalawanna and Kusa Paba, this could be reckoned as another step towards a mass audience. Buddhist Literature is enriched with glorified themes. Yasodhara is the pinnacle of such themes! The filmmaker uses all these legends for the portrayal of Yasodhara.
Spiritual material
Sinhala or the Sri Lankan Cinema always went in search of these materials. D C L Amarasinghas Vesaturu Siritha is the first colossal production in this sphere. Though not a money-spinner, it was truly rooted in epic film tradition. Wimalanath Dissanayakas Patachara and Kundalakesi were two attempts, though failed. Hollywood Productions by Cecile B de Milles Ten Commandments was an epic in that tradition. Ben Hur was partially related to religious literature. Jesus Christ Super Star was a controversial handling of a religious leaders character!
Indian cinema and literature had always tried to portray the Buddhas character, but not adequate. Angulimala the Hindi film, a failure in India, draw masses when the film was dubbed to Sinhala in Sri Lanka!
Yasodhara proves once again that producers are keen to finance colossal productions. The question remains is how it will be received by the audience. It depends upon the promotion of the film. Sri Lankan Film Industry is facing a crisis. And without any protection from the foreign films exhibited freely, its quite encouraging that producers of the calibre of H D Premasiri took a step of bravery.

Depreciating rupee could entice foreign investment to CSE
The depreciating rupee might provide fresh opportunities for foreign investors to invest in the Colombo Stock Exchange(CSE), a senior investment advisor attached to the Sampath Securities said.
While exporters gain from rupee depreciation, a strengthening rupee benefits companies that rely on imports or else more local currency is needed to purchase imports and exporters get more local currency when they convert the export proceeds.
In this scenario, there might be an impact on the overall performance of import oriented companies. In the meantime, current political development in Sri Lanka has somewhat undermined the investor confidence in the market, however, the political uncertainty and rupee currency hasnt created any huge impact on overall market activities so far. The market has been waiting for signs of political stability,the advisor said.
Nevertheless, senior official expressed hope that market activities are likely to pick up next week following the Cabinet reshuffle and the next election not scheduled until 2020.

2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020: Minister
Commemorating the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, 2,721 families were provided with title deeds, houses and other relief yesterday at the ceremony, held opposite the late Presidents statue at Hulftsdrop in Colombo, yesterday morning.
Minister Sajith Premadasa handed over title deeds to 2,308 families living in the Colombo area, in memory of his father, the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa at the ceremony. In addition, 326 families were provided with fully-fledged houses. Six athletes who won medals at 2018 Commonwealth Games were each given a house worth Rs. 3.5 million. A total of 81 UNP supporters who were victims of political revenge were also compensated at the ceremony. Minister Premadasa pledged to establish 2,500 Uda Gammana villages by 2020.
Minister Sajith Premadasa welcoming the gathering said that he is dedicated to strengthen the Yahapalana government while protecting the President and Prime Minister from organized mud-slingers.
Some are trying all possible gimmicks to disrupt the progress of this government. We are all dedicated to secure this government upon our lives. Some organized groups are spreading all sorts of fake news and rumors, trying to take down this government. We should defeat all such attempts. The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa had to face a similar situation at that time. So do the present President and the Prime Minister. Some try to come back to power based on lies. I am ready to take a step forward or backward to shield our President and the Prime Minister, Minister Sajith Premadasa said.
Minister Premadasa pointed out that the citizens want the present government to execute the mandate given by them in 2015. Titles and portfolios are impermanent. Everything is decided on the power of universal suffrage. We should understand the sovereignty of the people. Our success or lack of it will be decided upon the heart beat of our people. If people are happy, our political journey will lengthen. If their expectations are not met, our political journey will shorten. We need to stand strong with the revolution in 2015, Minister Premadasa pointed out.
Some people are trying to imply things about me too. They are spreading rumours on a so-called Raja Yogaya I am waiting for in 2025. I have to say that I am not a man enslaved by astrological beliefs. I believe that the most important Raja Yoga is being a person in peoples hearts, he said.
Speaking of his fathers political vision, Minister Premadasa said that his father was dedicated to economically empower the downtrodden and the underprivileged. His ideology on social justice is valid to date, Minister Premadasa said. He also said that 25 temples will be established in the 25 districts on June 23 commemorating the birth anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.

[APPRECIATIONS - (02-05-2018)]
Dr. Lester James Peries
An iconic cinematographer
Were a star quenched on highFor ages would its light,Still travelling down ward from the skyShine on our mortal sightSo when a great man diesFor years beyond our kenThe light he leaves behind him liesUpon the paths of men.
- Henry Wordsworth Longfellow.
The line of mortal destiny of Dr. Lester James Peries, has run its karma and reached the finale at 99 years of age.
When we take a panoptic view of the near-century-long life he led, the image that emerges is that of a subdued, sober visionary. His quiet, restrained and civilized cultural heroism further enhanced the lustre of his life.
Hailing from insular urban roots, Dr. Lester James Peries eventually found himself in the global gallery of cinema savants.
The paths he had to tread, to scale such creative heights, had not always been rosy; he had to defy hideous challenges. Obstructions and impediments serried against him had to be overcome.
Destiny is an expression that seems to have dominated the unparalleled human and creative evolution of Dr. Peries.
His father, Dr. James Francis Peries, once gifted him an 8mm Kodasko projector. This rudimentary piece of film equipment ran Charlie Chaplin's silent movies. To the young Lester, this proved not only a simple toy, but also the foundation stone for his life-long dedication to the film industry.
That toy had an eradicable impact on his inner being during his formative years.
His urge for cinematic creation goes back to the late 1940's, when he was young and living in London. For him and for a like-minded group of enthusiastic young people, the cine-camera became an absorbing toy that gave them an instrument to impose a semblance of visual discipline upon the disarray of diffuse experiences of their youthful days in a cosmopolitan city, far away from home.
Peries initial forays into the cinematic field were exclusively in the format of the documentary genre.
The erratic progress in the documentary medium was a fitting apprenticeship for a lively talent whose Line of Destiny (Rekawa), was eventually to lead him to creative heights in fictional films.
His return to Sri Lanka was to have a far-reaching effect on the course of the island's film industry. Strangely enough, his homecoming was determined by an expatriate who headed the Sri Lankan Film Unit at that time. The person in question, Ralph Keene, was so persuasive that Dr. Lester came back home and joined the unit.
He plunged into documentary film-making with zest and zeal and made a series of documentaries that still remain pioneering works in this genre in Sri Lanka.
The documentary period of Peries evolution made him appreciate how resource-rich Sri Lanka was for the film-maker. The locations impressed him, especially after his sojourn in the west.
Since, he was back in his native land as an outsider due to his long absence from home, the exotic in our culturethe fresh appeal of our way of lifebegan to entice him.
At this stage, when we look back on the life of Lesterthe cinematic geniusit is essential to dwell briefly on his advent into Sri Lanka's cinema history.
The central event that was to determine his future in Sri Lankan cinema took place in January, 1947, when the first-ever Sinhala film appeared to the massive enthusiasm of the Sri Lankan film-goer. For Sri Lankan audiences, the novelty of a Sinhala-speaking filmtheir own tonguewas an overwhelming experience.
But soon, the novelty wore off, partly because the country's compact society tended to be more critical than the amorphous audiences that had been the mainstay of South Indian films for decades.
The mere theatricality of the presentation and the artificiality of the first Sinhala films, began to jar the sensibilities of Sri Lankan film-goers during the first few years of Sinhala cinema. The stilted dialouge, which was satisfying in the legitimate theatre, seemed incongruous in the cinema medium, in which realism held the predominant appeal. Peries years in the documentary made it possible for him to utilise the genuine film medium to achieve a more realistic appeal to life. When he made his first feature film debut with Rekawa in 1956, Dr. Lester was still document-rust turned fiction filmmaker. From the first, he set out to be more plausible than those pioneering Sinhala film-makers, for whom a film was essentially a cinematographed stage-play.
Rekawa dramatically embodies the core of Dr. Lester's cinematic credo.
From then on, Dr. Peries cinematic destiny was altered substantially.
Early in his formal film career, Dr. Peries came to be recognised as the establishment. The subsequent history of Sinhala cinema could be described as the Sri Lankan cinema's creative efforts reacting against this establishment. Whether the film-workers who came in the slip-stream of his films admired him, opposed him or even denounced him, Dr. Peries remained the central force propelling Sinhala cinema forward.
Dr. Peries film philosophy is characterised by a cautions, non-controversial stance. He may deal with vital, socially relevant issues at times, but such situations are viewed with detachment and objectivity, that not even a mere trace of partisan shop could be detected. His cinematic style is essentially reflective and is bereft of biased comment or controversial polemics.
The body of his works exudes a refined Asian flavour. He always maintained a calmness, bordering upon a tranquillity akin to a spiritual state. Jealousy, rancour, pettiness and other blemishes of the ilk, never marred the purity of his soul.
Dr. Lester James Peries presided over the destine of Sri Lankan cinema, imperceptibly, impersonally and in spirit.
Even when his physical presence is no more around his influence will remain a potent factor, that will affect, Sri Lanka's Cinema Establishment.
During this unfortunate time, when we mourn the passage of the unquestioned safe of Sri Lankan cinema, there are certain hesitations that trouble us.
We cannot help but come to the anguished conclusion that the mass culture, folk values and the dominant collective ideals of this paradise island, have plummeted, from which they are almost unretrievable.
The life of the great genius who has just left us, is a shattering example.
We have not had adequate national awareness to cherish such an unparalled genius in the manner he deserved.
And almost tearfully, we have to reconcile ourselves to the shattering reality that we have been reduced to a cultural desert where men of outstanding genius are largely confined to limbo until they pass away.
Let us face the truth that our island paradise claiming a brilliant tradition of fabled glory, seems incapable of producing geniuses anymore. And the worst is that we seem to be incapable of curating even the rare handful we get.
Media too, are to an extent, responsible for this heart-rending neglect. I doubt whether we could produce geniuses of this calibre in the years to come; Dr. Lester, above all, was a complete human being. He had an reputation for keeping his actors and actresses at ease, even during the most tense of situations.
Until his last breath, as it were, he was a genius days before the passing. He once scrutinised Chekovs Cherry Garden for scripting possibilities. Dr. Peries possessed a sense of humour and wit.
Dr. Lester James Peries passage is an irreparable loss. This is not a routine platitude; this is profoundly felt and springs from the depths of my soul as I have understood the genius comprehensively.
All our limitless sympathies should be offered to Sumithra, whose exacerbated loneliness cannot be fully understood by anyone.
May the genius Dr. Lester James Peries rest in eternal bliss.
Dr. Edwin Ariyadasa

ATM helps Sri Lanka  to source large number of  visitors from Middle East
Sri Lanka Tourism leveraged the Arabian Travel Market (ATM) complemented by three road shows, B2B and industry meetings in Dubai last week in a major push in the Middle East market.
Sri Lanka was showcased as an attractive holiday destination at the 24th Arabian Travel Market (ATM) which took place from April 22 to 25, 2018 at the Dubai International Exhibition & Convention Centre. Sri Lanka participated for the 16th consecutive year at the event with more than 60 industry participants.
The Arabian Market is important for Sri Lanka as it helps to source a large number of visitors from the region. During the month of March 2018 there were 15,894 tourist arrivals from the Middle East. The event coincided with three roadshows which were held from April 17 to 19 in UAE by the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau in collaboration with the Sri Lanka consulate in Dubai. This was the first time SLTPB organized three consecutive roadshows in UAE.
The attractive Sri Lanka pavilion at the ATM was the center of attraction and drew large crowds. It was declared open by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga. The Sri Lankan delegation to the ATM included Senior Advisor to the Minister, Felix Rodrigo, Sri Lankas Consul General in Dubai and Northern Emirates, Charitha Yattegoda, Managing Director, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Sutheash Balasubramanium and Assistant Director, Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau, Ajantha Rathnayake.
A press conference was held parallel to the travel fair to keep the international media well informed about the new developments in the tourism industry in Sri Lanka and the many attractions for the Middle Eastern travelers.
The Minister also held discussions with a cross section of industry professionals on boosting bilateral tourism traffic. The B2B meetings which were held on the sidelines of the fair proved to be fruitful and had a positive impact especially in encouraging investment opportunities in Sri Lanka.
The Arabian Travel Market (ATM) 2018 is the largest annual exhibition for the tourism trade in the Middle East. Sri Lanka Tourism has been participating at this event since 2003 along with members of the travel and tourism industry.
ATM now facilitates $2.4 billion in industry deals and attracts 2,800 exhibitors from 86 countries and over 26,000 influential visitors.

Australian cricket cheating plot sparks ethics review
Sydney, MONDAY: Cricket Australia on Tuesday appointed an ethics guru to review the sport's culture in the wake of the cheating scandal that has rocked "the gentleman's game".
The governing body said it wanted to ensure there was never a repeat of the conduct during the third Test against South Africa in March that tarnished Australian cricket's reputation.
"We understand and share the disappointment of fans and the broader Australian community about these events," CA chairman David Peever said in a statement.
"The board is determined to do all we can to prevent such events from ever happening again."
During the match in Cape Town, captain Steve Smith, vice-captain David Warner and batsman Cameron Bancroft plotted to tamper with the ball using sandpaper, earning themselves lengthy bans.
Coach Darren Lehmann also resigned amid criticism he allowed a win-at-all-costs attitude to flourish that gave rise to the cheating scandal.
CA has acknowledged cultural issues within the team and on Tuesday said Simon Longstaff would conduct a wide-ranging review into the sport.
Longstaff is head of Sydney-based non-profit organisation The Ethics Centre, which aims to promote ethical decision-making in business, government and everyday life.
He is expected to quiz current and former players, administrators, media and sponsors about ethical issues facing the sport before making recommendations.
Longstaff did not comment in the CA statement but said last month that those involved in the scandal had lost their "internal compass".
"(It's) essentially good people making bad decisions with sometimes calamitous effects - tragically so as we've seen in this case," he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation.
"It's an inability to recognise the small things that start to change the seeds of some deeper corruption of a core set of values and principles... a type of deviance becomes normalised."
Longstaff's review will run in tandem with a separate probe announced last month into player behaviour headed by former Test batsman Rick McCosker.
McCosker will work with former players to formulate a charter on player behaviour balancing the demands of elite cricket with public expectations about the way such role models should act.
Peever said CA wanted to implement recommendations from both the Longstaff and McCosker reviews in time for the 2018-19 season. AFP

Balls five-for puts Notts on top
LONDON, Monday - Nottinghamshire beat Worcestershire by an innings and 41 runs to go top of the English County Championship Division One table on Monday.
Notts forced victory inside five sessions of playing time after the first two days were lost to rain.
A swift 38 from England bowler Stuart Broad helped Notts to 300-9 declared, giving the visitors a lead of 190 and a minimum of 80 overs to force a result.
Pace bowler Jake Ball boosted his England Test hopes with 5-59 as Worcestershire were bowled out for 149. For Worcestershire, who suffered a third straight defeat, only three batsmen, including top-scorer Tom Fell (37), faced more than 30 balls in the innings, which lasted just 38.2 overs.
Ball removed opener Brett D'Oliveira with the second ball of the hosts' second innings and they lost three wickets in the 10 overs before lunch, before slipping to a third consecutive Championship defeat in the afternoon session.
England opener Mark Stoneman again failed to fully press his case for Test selection in Surrey's Division One draw with Lancashire at Old Trafford.
Stoneman made a patient 29, his highest score in four Championship innings this season, before he was caught behind down the leg side off Tom Bailey.
Surrey, following on 204 runs behind after being bowled out for 235 on the final morning, ended on 199-6. Paceman Bailey took 4-13 in 19 overs for an impressive match haul of 8-67.
Jack Leaning's 68 could not prevent Somerset from claiming their second win of the Championship campaign as they beat Yorkshire by 118 runs in Taunton.
Chasing a target of 321, with nine wickets left, Yorkshire lost Cheteshwar Pujara to the day's first ball.
Adam Lyth (34) and skipper Gary Ballance (19) soon followed as the visitors slumped to 81-4.
Leaning hit eight fours and he was last to go as they were all out for 202, with Craig Overton taking 3-41.
Victory put Somerset second in the table behind Notts, and it is the first time since 1993 that they have started their Championship campaign with two wins.
Hampshire and Essex vied for bonus points as their weather-affected match at the Ageas Bowl ended in a draw.
Resuming on 241-4, Liam Dawson (34 not out) and Kyle Abbott (43) helped Hampshire secure a fourth batting bonus point as they declared on 351-7.
Brad Wheal (2-63) helped reduce Essex to 61-3 in reply before Alastair Cook (84) anchored the visitors' recovery.
Ravi Bopara (84 not out) helped guide the defending champions to 300-6 with help from James Foster (46).
Hampshire, who were denied a third bowling point, move up to third in the table while Essex remain unbeaten at the start of their title defence and leapfrog Yorkshire to go fourth.
Sussex and Gloucestershire were thwarted in their respective bids for a Division Two victory as rain prevented any play on the final day at Hove.
The visitors were due to resume on 108-6, chasing 167 to win. But a tense conclusion never materialised as the weather intervened and play was called off for the day. Both sides took eight points from the match, leaving both on 29 points after three Division Two games.

Allegations of corruption and malpractices:
BASL urges attorney to provide evidence
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL) has urged Attorneyat-Law Sugandhika Fernando to supply information and evidence with regard to the allegations that she made against corruption and malpractices in the system of justice and law enforcement in Sri Lanka, within 14 days to the BASL in order that action can be instituted against any wrongdoers, Bar Association of Sri Lanka(BASL) President Attorney-at-Law, U.R.De Silva (PC) said yesterday.
The Association has urged her from the beginning to provide evidence to back her allegations.But,she did not do that and made a public announcement at a press conference held at the Public Library recently.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, the BASL President further said the BASL would like to work with her to find the truth about the people that such allegations are levelled against.
If there any complaint against a lawyer, it can be initially probed through the BASL Ethics Committee while any complaint against Judges should be directed to the Judicial Service Commission (JSC), the BASL President said.
There could be corrupted individuals in all of these entities.But,it is wrong to tar the everyone with the same brush. There are many honest individuals, he said.
Meanwhile, Attorney-at-Law Nagananda Kodiwaththu has called for a debate between him and the BASL President on several issues pertaining to justice and law enforcement in the country,but,the BASL Executive Committee has decided not to participate in any such debate.
The BASL has decided that it is not worth debating these so called allegations. There is no point of debating these issues, but we plan to resolve all the issues pertaining to the justice and law enforcement system gradually one by one, the BASL President added.

Beyond the legacy
Lesters talent was not to be wasted on documentaries and he soon grew bored with the subject. He was a person who recognised the pulse of the public and strived to make his own mark in a society that was used to viewing films with some Indian influence
Traversing through the winding path of destiny he reached the zenith of glory. The contented but unexhausted traveller who devoted his life to change the line of destiny of the Sinhala cinema passed away on April 29 at the age of 99 while receiving treatments at a private Hospital in Colombo.
Considered as the father of Sinhala cinema, Dr Lester James Peries was also the longest living filmmaker in the world. With a career spanning more than 50 years the iconic filmmaker revolutionized the Sinhala film industry with his globally acclaimed film Rekava in 1956. Rekava was the first Ceylonese movie to be shot outdoors. It was nominated for the Palme dOr at the 1957 Cannes Film Festival.
An internationally acclaimed film director, screenwriter, and film producer, Dr Peries was involved in over 28 films including shorts and documentaries. He was not only a national treasure but was also one of the biggest brand names in the cinema world. The reason for this was that he was more highly regarded abroad than in his native country.
With a career spanning more than 50 years Dr Peries has made what his friend and companion Lindsay Anderson as works of Chekhovian grace. Some of his noteworthy productions are Delovak Athara (Between Two Worlds), Golu Hadawatha (Cold Heart), Akkara Paha (Five Acres of land), Nidhanaya (The Treasure), The God King, Madol Doowa (Enchanted Island), Beddegama (Village in the jungle) Kaliugaya (The Time of Kali), Yuganthaya (The Changing Village), Avaragira (The Sunset), Wekanda Walauwa (The mansion by the lake) and many more. His last film was Ammavarune (An Elegy for a Mother) which was screened in 2006.
Lester was born on April 5, 1919, to a family of four children. His parents were Dr. James Francis Peries and Ann Gertrude Winifred Jayasuriya. He was an old boy of St. Peters College, Colombo. Though his parents wished him to enter priesthood the youths passion for theatre and films carved his destiny.
He started his career as a journalist at the Daily News and joined the Times of Ceylon working under Frank Moraes in 1939. In 1947 Lester travelled to England to join his brother, Ivan, who was there on an art scholarship.
During these six years abroad his interest in films developed. He was committed to his passion. Having joined the Government Film Unit of Ceylon as an assistant director, he worked under the distinguished English documentary filmmaker Ralph Keene.
He made a number of documentaries like Heritage of Lanka and Nelungama. He also directed Conquest in the Dry Zone; a documentary based on controlling malaria and Be safe or be sorry, a witty study on errant motorists.
Lesters talent was not to be wasted on documentaries and he soon grew bored with the subject. He was a person who recognised the pulse of the public and strived to make his own mark in a society that was used to viewing films with some Indian influence.
Rekhava was released in 1956 and it marked a watershed in Sri Lankan cinema. He released his second film Sandeshaya (The Message) in 1960. His third creation Gamperaliya screened in 1964 was instantly recognised as a superior work of cinematic art and won the Grand Prix (Golden Peacock) at the International Film Festival of India in New Delhi.
The iconic filmmaker has made two attempts at reaching for a wider international audience. The first is a British co-production named The God King (1974), starring Oliver Tobias and Leigh Lawson was set in fifth-century Ceylon. It related a colourful but bloody story. It proved a fraught production despite a comparatively large budget. He fared better with a 1980 adaptation of Leonard Woolfs novel Village in the Jungle, which was stunningly captured by his long-term collaborator Willie Blake.
Lesters Wekande Walauwa, starring Ravindra Randeniya and Malani Fonseka, was Sri Lankas first ever submission for the Academy Awards.
Lester was married to the equally renowned film directress Sumitra Peries nee Gunewardena since 1964. Taking a cue from her husband Sumitra also shares a passion for movie making and has made her mark in the cinematic scene with her own unique style in making movies.
Lester had introduced many artistes who went on to make big names in the industry. He worked with cinematographer Willie Blake and film editor Titus Totawatte in Rekava. Veteran actor Iranganie Serasinghe acted in one of his documentaries, Parissam Venna Nethnam Kanagatu Venna (Be safe or be sorry) before taking up a role in Rekava.
Film legend Gamini Fonseka joined the Rekava team as a technician and later went on to take the second lead in Sandeshaya. K.A.W. Perera, the renowned filmmaker composed the dialogues for the film while Rev. Fr. Marcelline Jayakody penned the lyrics.
Well known musician Sunil Shantha set the melodies and Indrani Wijebandara and Ivor Dennis contributed as playback singers to Rekava. Lester also worked with many well loved artistes of the golden era like Jeevarani Kukurulasuriya in Sandeshaya and Tony Ranasinghe, Anula Karunathilaka, Trilicia Gunawardena, Wickrama Bogoda and G.W. Surendra in Gamperaliya. Veteran journalist and film critic Regi Siriwardena wrote the screenplay of Gamperaliya and renowned media personality Tissa Abeysekara was the additional screenplay writer for the film.
The key behind Lesters creations is his loyalty and dedication to his work. The essence of his creations is often derived from local families in rural settings. His journey to the top was difficult but his unwavering confidence succeeded in bringing the Sri Lankan cinema to the main cultural stream.
He has received countless honours and lifetime achievement awards. The road in which his house had been was renamed after him. On his birthday in 2002 a million 3.50 rupee stamps were struck in his honour. A book, Lester by Lester  as told to Kumar de Silva, was published in 2007.

British PM braces for election test
UK: With Prime Minister Theresa May on the ropes over her Brexit strategy and immigration policy, Britains main opposition Labour Party hopes to deliver a further blow in local elections on Thursday.
Labour is targeting traditional strongholds for Mays Conservatives such as Wandsworth, south London, just days after the resignation of top ally Amber Rudd as interior minister.
We need a change, Beverley Shillingford, a 54-year-old social worker living in a tower block in Wandsworth, told AFP as Labour Party supporters went canvassing door-to-door one evening in April.
Shillingford accused the boroughs Conservative leaders of letting this place fall down and fellow residents in the 16-storey building complained about everything from a lack of services to a mouse problem.
Defeat in the local council polls would pile further pressure on May, who is struggling to keep her party united on Brexit and whose leadership has been on borrowed time ever since she lost her partys parliamentary majority in a general election last year.
Rudds departure for misleading parliament over migrant deportation targets also deprives May of a key ally at a difficult time.
The big attention will be on London and the Tories are going to do badly, said Robert Hayward, a Conservative peer and polling expert.
Although essentially people are supposed to be voting on local issues, the reality is that turnout is often driven by perceptions of national politics. Paul Scully, the Conservatives vice chairman for London, told AFP: Its going to be really tough.
We are trying to hold on to what weve got, he said.
The elections are set to highlight Britains burgeoning divides between urban and rural areas, and eurosceptic and pro-European voters, according to analysts.
John Curtice, politics professor at Strathclyde University and one of Britains top polling experts, believes May will make gains outside the big cities, cementing her partys move away from the more cosmopolitan conservatism of predecessor David Cameron.
When results come out, expect to see Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn celebrating in London and the prime minister in Englands provincial heartlands, agreed Hayward.
Nonetheless, losing Wandsworth would be a stinging and symbolic Conservative defeat.
The borough was former Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers favourite local authority for pioneering free-market policies and has low local tax rates and a reputation for sound management.
Conservative voters stayed true even when Labour swept its three parliamentary seats in the 1990s and while similar urban areas have shifted leftwards. Ravi Govindia, the incumbent leader, said he is hopeful of retaining control.
There is not a single Labour authority in London that has the kind of low tax levels that our Wandsworth has, he told AFP in his office in the boroughs town hall. - AFP

Coca-Cola  eyes health business  with Beijing LePur tie-up
The Coca-Cola Co China is expanding into the yogurt business with an investment in Beijing LePur to tap the growing demand for healthy products in the country.
Coca-Cola China has signed an agreement with Beijing LePur. The companies will collaborate in areas that include new product development, digital innovation and incubation of new brands.
The investment in LePur is an example of Coca-Colas consumer-centric strategy as the company continues to expand its portfolio, according to the beverage company.
Founded in 2015, LePur is one of the fastest-growing brands to have emerged as Chinese consumers upgrade their consumption preferences. LePur offers a wide range of high-end products, including high-protein Greek yogurt and cereal.
The strategic partnership is expected to enhance both companies growth potential and meet the evolving tastes and needs of Chinese consumers.
Coca-Cola is accelerating its journey as a total beverage company, said Curt Ferguson, president of Coca-Cola in China.
LePur shares our interest in high-quality products, innovative business models and being consumer oriented. Through our strategic investment and cooperation, we will enhance our connection with consumers via desirable products and engaging digital experiences.
From a broader perspective, we believe this will contribute to innovation and the continued development of Chinas beverage industry.
Denny Liu, CEO of LePur, said: LePurs business strategy is to integrate sophisticated global resources to develop more appealing products. Through the strategic investment, LePur will benefit from Coca-Colas deep industry experience and proven ability to scale up emerging businesses. It will further ensure our sustainable growth in new retail and omnichannel operations, as well as creating better consumer experiences.
LePur has experienced strong growth in the past year based on data from Kantar Worldpanel China. It has used the internet and e-commerce to build a brand rapidly and command the highest price premium in the market catering to consumer demand for health and well-being, said Jason Yu, general manager of Kantar China.
Coca-Cola has been trying to diversify its product portfolio to meet the new consumer demand while in the past it wasnt able to tap into the growth of the dairy sector, which is booming, Yu said.
The dairy business has strict supply chain requirements while Coca-Cola has relied on its bottling business to distribute products, he said.
The move shows that Coca-Cola is heading toward a more agile business building model as LePur is 100 percent local, Yu added.
It shows that they are focusing on rapid buildup of advantage while in the past it may have taken a long time.
The beverage giant has achieved a strong financial performance in the first quarter of this year.
Its figures for the first three months, released on April 24, show that its net revenues declined 16 percent to $7.6 billion, impacted by a 26 percent headwind from re-franchising of bottling territories.
Organic revenue grew 5 percent, driven by concentrate sales growth of 4 percent and price growth of 1 percent. In China, its soda business has seen double digit growth.
The company has seen unit case volume growth of 5 percent, driven by strong performance in China.
We are encouraged with our first quarter performance as we continue our evolution as a consumer-centric, total beverage company, said James Quincey, president and CEO of The Coca-Cola Company.

The Bank recorded a growth of 17% in total operating income amounting to Rs 4,093 million for the quarter ended March 31, 2018 compared to Rs 3,503 in the comparative period in 2017. However due to the higher charge for impairment as a result of Banks prudent provisioning policies, the net operating income recorded a growth of only 4%.The Banks NPL ratio increased to 3.12% as at March 2018 from 2.77% recorded in December 2017 as a result of adverse environmental conditions in the operating environment. The industry NPL ratio also recorded an upward trend.
The Bank has strengthened processes whereby close follow up measures are taken to arrest defaults at an early stage and all efforts are made to swiftly recover loans in default.The Bank achieved a notable growth in its core business operations during the quarter under review. During the current period, net interest income grew by 29% to Rs 3,342 million from Rs 2,581 million in the 1st quarter of 2017 while net fee and commission income grew by 27% to Rs 434 million from Rs 343 million in the comparable period. Interest margin improved to 4.0% during the quarter under review from 3.6% in the comparable period.
Operating expenses increased from Rs 1,343 million to Rs 1,579 million (18%) in the comparable period due to branch expansion and business promotions that were carried out during the first quarter 2018. Bank added 10 fully fledged branches during the period April 2017 to March 2018 and continued its drive to expand its franchise through business promotions, which helped to increase income streams.
Other comprehensive income before tax improved by Rs 1,475 million (86%) over the previous period. Mark to market impact on investment in equity securities under available for sales investment has improved by Rs 1,771 million year on year while mark to market impact on fixed income securities declined by Rs 296 million.
Total assets of the Bank grew by Rs 67,236 million year on year which reflects a 24% growth compared to March 2017. The growth in total assets from December 2017 was Rs 18,393 million (6%). Continuing the growth strategy, Banks Loans to and receivables from other customers (Loans and advances) grew by Rs 35,475 million to Rs 222,588 million compared to Rs 187,113 million as at March 31,2017 reflecting a growth of 19%.

The Banks low cost deposits (CASA) ratio was 19.6% compared to 21.3% as at December 31, 2017.
This is a result of an increased growth in time deposits versus savings which is reflected in the first quarter. With the impending promotional campaigns planned to mobilise low cost deposits this position will be corrected in the coming months.
The Bank continues to enjoy long term concessionary credit lines which improve the ratio to 28.4% as at March 31, 2018.
The Bank has successfully issued BASEL III compliant Tier II listed rated unsecured subordinated redeemable debenture of Rs 7 billion (oversubscribed on opening day) in order to sustain the planned lending growth and to maintain stable Basel III compliant ratio.

The Cabinet reshuffle yesterday saw the reduction of the number of ministries to 42 as subject allocations to new Cabinet portfolios were made on a scientific basis.
Eighteen new Cabinet Ministers were sworn-in by President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday at the Presidential Secretariat in the presence of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The remaining portfolios remain unchanged.
This was the second reshuffle of the Cabinet effected by the government since it took office in 2015.
Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe who was removed from his earlier post as the Minister of Justice was appointed as the Minister of Higher Education and Cultural Affairs.
Cultural Affairs was previously held by Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam.
Minister Kabir Hashim who earlier held the post of Higher Education Minister was given Highways and Road Development.
Agriculture which was earlier run by Duminda Dissanayake has been given to Mahinda Amaraweera.
Amaraweeras previous post of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development along with Minister P. Harrisons Rural Economy, has been given to Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soysa. Soysas Irrigation, Water Resources Management and former Minister Anura Priyadharshana Yapas Disaster Management was given to Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
Two portfolios which were held by the Ministers of the UPFA were given to the UNP.
The former SLFP Ministry of Social Welfare and Social Empowerment in the meantime has been split with Social Empowerment going to UNP Ministers P. Harrison and Social Welfare along with Primary Industries going to Minister Daya Gamage.
Further, the Minister of Labour and Trade Union Relations was given to UNP Minister Ravindra Samaraweera.
Samaraweeras former post of Wildlife and Sustainable Development was given to Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka.
Minister Thalatha Athukorala received Prison Reforms to go with her Ministry of Justice while Minister D.M. Swaminathan who held Prison Reforms previously was given Northern Development in addition to his previous posts of Rehabilitation, Resettlement and Hindu Religious Affairs.

The reshuffle was done in a scientific manner by the collective decisions of the President and Prime Minister.
The accuracy of this scientific way will be proven when these portfolios are gazetted. The preparation of the gazette is almost complete, stated Minister Maddumabandara speaking to the media after the event.
This should be the final Cabinet reshuffle. We can now work towards the goal of developing the country together. There is a Unity Government at present and it will be so in the future too. Many issues crop up when two leading parties get together which is quite natural. But we have resolved those issues and have the ability to start a new journey together, he added. Minister Sajith Premadasa who attended the event along with his other cabinet colleagues who have not had their positions changed noted, It is unfair to judge the success of the reshuffle just minutes after it took place. We have a capable Cabinet and Im sure that their excellence can be judged through the various policy implementations from today onwards. The decision making process that led to the Cabinet reshuffle was engineered and pioneered by the President and the Prime Minister. Both of them did it through consultation, compromise and discussion. Minister of Lands and Parliamentary reforms Gayantha Karunathilake in the meantime said, A reshuffle means to make the changes which did not happen in the past.
The reshuffle took place today on a scientific basis and the gazette would also confirm this. The success of the changes will be seen when the portfolios are gazetted. I believe that we can all look at this in a positive way.

Glimpses of Rajiva Wijetunges 40-year Mercantile sports career
Hailing from the town of Matara, an old boy of Royal College, Colombo 7, Rajiva Wijetunge is no stranger to the Sri Lankan sporting arena. From his younger years at Royal College, Rajiva was determined to stride ahead through participation in cricket, athletics and table tennis. From 1977-1979, he represented Royal College in cricket as an opening bowler and was a member of the Royal College cricket team for the centenary Royal Thomian encounter in 1979. Rajiva was also awarded as the best bowler at the Royal Thomian 50 overs encounter in 1979.
Another rare achievement of Rajivas school sports career is becoming a triple coloursman, being awarded Royal College colours for cricket, athletics and table tennis. In 1979, Rajiva participated in the first Mercantile Table Tennis Meet in Colombo and continued his participation as a tradition uninterrupted for the last 40 years, being the only one to do so.
On joining the corporate world, Rajiva was keen to pursue a veterans sports career, specially in athletics and table tennis. Rajiva was appointed a National Selector for table tennis from 2002 to 2007 and thereafter from 2010 to 2015. He is the only Sri Lankan to win an individual medal at the World Masters Games for table tennis in 2005. He was a member of the National Olympic Committee (NOC) in 2007/2008 and was appointed Chef de Mission of the Sri Lankan contingent for the third Commonwealth Youth Games in Pune, India 2008.

He has won twenty-five international event medals for Sri Lanka and is a double international Masters in athletics and table tennis. He was recently honoured to be invited as the guest of honour at the Royal College Colours Night 2017.
He has participated in the Mercantile Athletics Tournament from 1983 to 2018 without missing a single tournament, completing a total of 35 years.
Rajivas over 40 years of star studded sporting career is a fine example to prove that age is no barrier to achieve your sporting goals with correct mind setup and commitment. Sports build character, teamwork, discipline and agility. As a daughter I see a good combination of those characteristics in my father, Rajiva and feel privileged to have a father such as him. He is a daily inspiration to many around him.

## Title: Goodbye LJP!!!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, May 2, 2018 - 01:00
Goodbye LJP!!!
From the time he passed the Biblical lifespan of three score and ten in 1989, Lester James Peries often joked that he was living on borrowed time.
Twenty nine years later, 24 days after his 99th birthday, on the Thrice Hallowed Vesak Poya night, he finally breathed his last, never to return.
I know that reams will be written about him as a filmmaker and his outstanding contribution to Sri Lankan and world cinema. Let me thus focus on LJP the human being.
My first meeting with the Perieses was in 1986 with Bonsoir, the fledgling weekly television programme sponsored by the Embassy of France in Sri Lanka and telecast over ITN. We were to find in LJP and Sumitra never exhausting subject matter for future programmes.
Bonsoirs mission was to bring France and Franco-Sri Lankan ties to Sri Lankan television audiences. It was thus a bonus that both LJPs and Sumitras personal and professional lives were inextricably linked with France.
And so began my friendship with the Perieses. The Bonsoir crew and cameras were frequent visitors to No. 24, Dickmans Road (now Dr. Lester James Peries Mawatha). The result - Bonsoirs countless hours of interviews and programmes on LJP and Sumitra.
Years down the line, I had the privilege and unique honour of ghost writing Lester by Lester - as told to Kumar de Silva. This was HIS story on the making of his 20 films, from Rekawa (The Line of Destiny, 1956) across half a century to Ammawarune (Elegy for a Mother, 2006).
The project took five long years, during which time I spent countless post-lunch hours with him, for days on end, just he and I. There we were, locked up in the office room at No. 24 (lest the household dog barge in), my outstretched hand holding a dictaphone close to his face. LJP would talk and talk and talk with great enthusiasm and I would luxuriate in reciprocated enthusiasm listening to his journey back in time. To say he had an elephantine memory is a gross understatement. He was a great raconteur.
Post-lunch, after a heavy rice and curry meal, there were also times when I (very ashamedly) fell asleep while he spoke. But he continued undeterred. When he finally finished relating the chapter into my dictaphone, he would apologetically gently tap me on the shoulder and say, Kumaaar, now get up. I have finished. I would wake up and jump up like a banshee out of hell only to see him with a mischievous smile on his face.
Ever since my first meeting with him, there have been two significant characteristics about the man that struck me most - his great wit and his total absence of malice.
LJP would maintain a very straight face and relate the most hilarious of stories, and then while those around him were bent in stitches, he would wear a deadpan je ne sais quoi look, as though they were doing something terribly silly.
Another incident was his very seriously self-imposed diplomatic status when Sumitra was Sri Lankas Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to France and Spain, and Permanent Delegate to UNESCO (19951999) and LJP was in a sense the shadow ambassador.
Based in Paris, where they first met in 1956, the couple was often invited out to soirees, diplomatic and otherwise. During these social gatherings LJP would, with yet another of those deadpan looks, say, You know, my wife Sumitra is H.E. the Ambassador. And who am I I am the Spouse of Her Excellency. And so I am a S.H.E. Those around him ended up not knowing whether to laugh or to condole. Such was his un-relentless wit.
During those four years in Paris, in his self-proclaimed role as S.H.E, LJP was a tower of strength to the Ambassador. He preferred to take the backseat. Just as in their life in cinema, this too was a symbiotic relationship. I have not seen another couple in such a harmonious domestic and professional relationship as LJP and Sumitra.
Much of the book, Lester by Lester - as told to Kumar de Silva,we edited on the run. He would first pour out his un-edited recollections on the making of those respective films and with it came spicy stories, pithy anecdotes, hilarious situations et al in his inimitable stylesometimes with a mischievous look in his eyessometimes with sadness in his face
But LJP being LJP, he didnt ever want to hurt anyone even with a word and so he would hastily add, Kumaaar shall we omit that part there and that other part there, etc etc etc. Better isnt it I kept to my word and none of those lines ever hit the pages of that book.
Quite unlike the hundreds, if not thousands, of others in this world we live and move in, LJP was one those very few human beings who never, and I repeat, never, had a bad word for another. He moved across all social strata, from Heads of State to the humblest of film technicians, but his simplicity, kindness and gentleness were the same to all.
When on June 13, 1997, the Government of France bestowed on LJP one of its highest national honours, Commander in the Order of Arts and Letters, Sumitra was Sri Lankas Ambassador to France at that time.
It was the couples 33rd wedding anniversary and they flew down to Colombo for the investiture at the BMICH. I remember LJP telling me how he had been totally taken aback when he was told of it and how deeply humbled he felt. He is still the only Sri Lankan to be so decorated at that level.
Seventeen years later when on November 24, 2014, the French Government conferred on Sumitra Peries the title of Chevalier in the Order of Arts and Letters, LJP came to the investiture in a wheelchair. It was an emotional moment for him. He was moved to tears. This is just so coincidentally unbelievable. Sumitra and I first met in Paris and now we have come the full cycle in this climax of our long karmic tryst, he said to me that evening, his eyes brimming with tears, joy written all over his face.
With successive national and international honours weighing heavier and heavier on his slight frame as the years passed, he could easily have acquired pomp and pomposity. Mais non,that was not LJP. While lots of others who have achieved much less, flaunt themselves, basking in glory and sometimes reflected glory, LJP remained the same simple man he always was. He was a one-of-a-kind human being. Such men are rare. They are irreplaceable.
LJP was very excited about Vaishnavee, Sumitras current movie and based on his original storyline. The film was in limbo for around five years and he was eagerly waiting for its release. It took a very, very long time. Despite his very poor and, at times, failing health he still hung on steadfastly. Vaishnavee was finally released on his 99th birthday on Thursday, April 5th, at a grand gala at the Regal Theatre in Colombo. Yet he was too ill to attend.
The following day when Yashoda Wimaladharma (the vaishnavee) visited him at his residence, he had held her hand tightly and said, You know Yashoda, Ihave been praying every night for the past six years that Vaishnavee will be released. Three-and-a-half weeks after that release, he was gone. In retrospect, I believe, despite his failing health, he hung on until the movie was finally released.
LJP is gonebut he leaves behind his 20 children and his celebrated and award-winning body of work, all of which will keep his memory vibrantly alive in this country and across world cinema and across time.
Goodbye my dearest LJP. You are finally free from all the physical suffering and from all the physical pain of this incarnation. I grieve. I grieve deeply. You were my unofficial Foster Father (to quote your own words).
My wish for you is that your journey through Samsara be speedy. My wish for myself is that I will meet you along that journey. Theruwan Saranai !!!

Govt. will have fresh start: PM
The Yahapalana government will march forward with a fresh program, supported by a newly appointed Cabinet despite unreasonable criticisms, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
The Premier was speaking at the ceremony to commemorate the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, yesterday morning.
Premier Wickremesinghe, pointing out that the Yahapalana government should take the late President Premadasas vision and mission as an example, said that it is their duty to continue the magnanimous industrial, housing and social welfare projects initiated by the late President and UNP head.
There are a number of people who accuse us left and right. They blame us continuously. But they dont come up with another way. If they are critical of the government, they should present us with a solid option. We have a plan. I am not denying the fact that we have our own shortcomings. Last February, the people of this country gave us a clear warning. They pointed out to us that we are slow in progress. They want us to keep our promises. So we are continuing with a fresh start, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Reminiscing on the past, Premier Wickremesinghe said he worked closely with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa when he was given the Minister of Industry portfolio.
Then President Premadasa contacted me and requested to start a project establishing garment factories around the country. His plan was to empower the village community. Accordingly, factories were established in areas such as Biyagama and Katunayaka.
He told me to establish those factories within a months time, when the investors were finalized. Whatever the issues relevant to the procedure, I was to inform him. Infrastructure issues were solved by him in two weeks. So we first established 100 garment factories. Then he wanted me to establish 100 more. Unfortunately, he did not live to witness all those factories. These factories provided numerous ways of income for people in rural areas.
Premier Wickremesinghe pointed out that the Yahapalana government is also facing similar issues in providing infrastructure facilities when promoting industries in the country. When we took over the government in 2015, no one trusted us. We couldnt access the global export market. But then we were able to retrieve the GSP+ facility. We won over international investors. We will generate government jobs as well as private jobs. We will have to generate ways of income for the young generation in this country, just like the late President Premadasa, he said.

Health for All
Universal Health Coverage is our new slogan. It is certainly laudable. I am 86-years-old and recollect my life as a Doctor, Public Health Officer (Malariology), Director of Anti-Malaria Campaign. After joining WHO I served as a Malariologist in Bangladesh, Nepal and ended as WHO Representative in Bangladesh.
After retirement, served as a consultant for USAID, World Bank, UN and WHO. You may say looks pretty impressive. I remember the slogan of the 1970s Health for All by the Year 2000. Sri Lanka was represented by Mrs Siva Obeysekara, Minister of Health and Dr Herbert Jesuthasan, Deputy Director General of Public Health Services. Siva was a dynamic minister and organiser. We all got into the act enthusiastically. This is 2018. Have we achieved Health for All
Mrs Obeysekara and Stalwarts like Dr Ana Wickremesinghe former Director, Anti- Malaria Campaign and Director General of Health Services plus many dedicated doctors, entomologists, PHIs, Laboratory Assistants, Microcopists, Field Assistants played a major role in the elimination of Malaria. It was a coordinated effort, including not only the health services but allied government departments, the private sector, NGOs and the Sri Lankan community itself. The recent elimination of malaria is certainly a successful story. Sri Lanka has other health success stories as well.
Local governments
I remember in the early 1980s we were enamoured with the call for Equity in Health nationwide and then globally. Equity is something perhaps you would attain in the Garden of Eden or in a mythical Eldorado. But certainly if we look at it retrospectively, there were for sure improvements in health in a number of receptive countries. Local governments must be convinced as well as the Opposition so that the plans formulated are carried out to meet the desired objectives and goals even if the Opposition comes into power. There are so many hot beds in the Middle East and other countries. How do we approach them
In WHO itself, the effort must be sustained at HQs level with direct links to its regional and country offices. The links must be firm, responsive and sustained. The linkages within the countries are vital, if the vision and mission are to succeed. Persistent monitoring of implementation is essential with ready remedial measures to be put in place, if progress is slow.
The Holistic approach is an essential pre-requisite for a country to succeed. Inter-country and inter-regional approaches will help the ultimate global push. Constant monitoring will assist implementation and help institute corrective measures if previous plans have failed. The bottom up approach is the most successful for continued implementation namely, village to district; district to province and province to country. The centre should be the source for country monitoring, revision and for change and implementation.
Health indicators and parameters
I remember that for any health unit to succeed it is not the medical officer who is the king pin but the unit as such. The Entomologists, the Nurse, the Public Health Inspector, the Microscopists, the Field Assistants, Laboratory Staff and equipment are equally important. Quick monitoring and immediate action on spotting would be disasters are vital. Each individual in the team must feel that he is essential for it to succeed.
As a Sri Lankan Community Physician, I must pay tribute to our pioneers in public health.
I recall Dr W A Karunaratne, Dr Herath Gunaratne and a host of others who made it possible for us to achieve these remarkable vital health statistical parameters. Its not the brilliant Cardiac Surgeon with his bypass surgery or that Sherlock Holmes type physician with his admirable diagnosis and cure. But the lowly Kanu or Drainage doctors as we were contemptuously called sometime back who helped to achieve these admirable health indicators and parameters. time waits for no one. So let us proceed with our arduous journey to improve our health standards keeping in mind, the constraints.
I remember my Senior Professor of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, Prof. Ranasinghe, Ranaya as we used to call him remark emphatically what say you!

## Title: Herbie Felsinger a legend among cricket umpires

Herbie Felsinger a legend among cricket umpires
Herbie Felsinger who officiated as a cricket umpire in an era where technological assistance for umpires was totally unheard of believed that umpires of his genre did a better job than the present ones.
The present umpires when they have a doubt they always go to the third umpire. In our time if we gave out thats it, the batsman went. If the ball pitches within the sticks and if it doesnt vary much and the batsman misses, its out, said Felsinger once in an interview.
His view is that the advent of technology has forced a lot of good umpires to retire from the game. Dickie Bird was one of them and later another top notch English umpire David Shepherd. They were good umpires and when they made a mistake they admitted it. Umpires should be very bold in giving decisions. Technology has taken away the pleasure of umpiring.
I read the laws of cricket before every match and it is fresh in my mind. What makes a good umpire First of all you must tell a prayer and walk out. You must give any decision, whether right or wrong, straight from the heart whoever the players is, he said.
What made Felsinger earn a reputation as one of the finest umpires to don the white coat for his country was his experience as a cricketer.
As a player I know I am out if the ball is pitched within the wickets and the ball hits me below the knee roll and I miss it. As an umpire the same principles apply. Playing the game makes it easier to umpire, especially if you are a good player. To be a good umpire you must play the game first and be well read and educated, Felsinger said.
The standard of Sri Lankan umpires according in Felsingers opinion is below standard. Sri Lankan umpiring standards have gone down from what it was during our time. The reason is more money. Umpires are always thinking of money not the game. They are keener to finish the match early and get the money.
Another area which Felsinger felt the local umpires were lacking is the back foot no-ball. Our umpires dont look at the back foot because most bowlers cut the line with the back foot and they are not no-balled. The greatest offender is Sanath Jayasuriya. If the back foot cuts the side line it is a no-ball. The umpires only look at the front foot for a no-ball and not the back foot. We were taught to look for this. On television when the ball is bowled the camera focuses on the batsman and not on the bowler so no one ever sees it. Only if a bowler is no-balled it is shown in slow motion where the front foot landed.
Felsinger was an umpire for two decades since 1971 until a stroke in 1991 left him partly paralysed and ended his career. I spent one month at Asiri Hospital. They said there is a clot in my brain and I couldnt be operated and that I would end up a vegetable. It took me about four years to recover from that illness. I couldnt talk for one year but my wife (Mignnone) understood me, Felsinger recalled. Even till his death Felsinger bore the scars of that stroke because he walked assisted by a walking stick and with a slight limp on his right leg.
Felsinger officiated in six Tests and 11 One-Day International matches between 1982 and 1986. Along with another umpiring icon KT Francis, Felsinger officiated in Sri Lankas inaugural Test match against England at the P Sara Oval in February 1982. At the time they were paid Rs. 750 a day for a five-day Test and Rs. 5000 for an ODI.
I didnt feel any pressure at all although it was our first Test match. For me it was just like a normal game, said Felsinger. I no-balled Ian Botham from my end first and second ball. After the captain spoke to him he bowled a legal ball and he asked me is that okay. I said it was. You must speak to the players not stay glum. On the fourth day we were looking very good to win the Test but the batsmen ate it up.
Felsinger also had the honour of officiating in the Centenary match between two traditional schools Royal and S Thomas in 1979 at the P Sara Oval.
Another incident which Felsinger remembers is helping Sri Lankan middle order batsman Ranjan Madugalle to score his maiden Test century against India at the SSC grounds in 1985.
I was umpiring at square leg when the Indian fielders appealed for a run out against Madugalle, but I had to say not out because one of the leg side fielders stood in front of me covering my vision. I couldnt see anything. Madugalle was on 40 odd at that time and he went on to make a Test hundred only because I was unsighted. After the match Gamini Dissanayake, the Sri Lanka Cricket Board president came to me and said good decision, said Felsinger.
On another occasion, officiating in a Pakistan v India ODI match at Sharjah with legendary English umpire Dickie Bird, Felsinger felt the Englishman imposed his authority on him as he was the senior umpire and was deciding on how the match should be conducted. But Felsinger who took everything in his stride had the last laugh when Bird miscounted and allowed a seventh ball to be bowled in an over off which Imran Khan, the Pakistan captain scored two runs. When the scorers were at a loss how to credit the seventh ball in their books, Felsinger stepped in and told them to take the two runs off the book and the game continued. At the awards ceremony Dickie admitted that I was a very good umpire and he told me if I came to England he would help me anytime. When I went there a few years later I rang him up, he came and met me.
Felsingers cricket career at school and at club was a real mixed bag. He was never allowed to settle down in one place. I went to Wesley College and studied up to the third standard when my father took me out and put me to Carey College. Playing for the Carey first eleven at the age of 14, I scored 202 (n.o.) opening the batting against St Johns, Nugegoda. That score is still a record today. I broke the previous record of 173. After two years I was back again at Wesley where I played as an opening bowler and opening bat. I never got to bowl after the seventh wicket went down because they preserved me for my batting, but in one match I managed to take five wickets.
Felsingers club history was almost on similar lines. He joined Moors SC as the first non-Muslim when Procter MAH Fuard (father of Sri Lanka off-spinner Abu Fuard) was president of the club and in his first season (1952-53) etched his name in the record books by putting together an unbroken opening partnership of 351 runs with Makkin Salih. While Salih went onto make a double century (237 n.o.), Felsingers contribution was 118 not out.
In my first match I scored 70 runs and in my second, we got this record partnership against Notts CC at the Moors SC grounds. I was adamant not to get out. I always pushed the single and gave Makkin the strike. Makkin was in good form and he hammered the ball all over and scored faster than me. He came and told me Herbie I am only scoring why not you Then I started hitting out and soon after I got to my hundred, I gave him most of the strike and we carried on till we had put on a record 351 runs for the first wicket, Felsinger recalled.
Makkin and I used to put on 100 runs for the first wicket at any time. The Moors batting strength was in the first three batsmen  Makkin, myself and MA Cafoor and then came Cabraal thereafter followed all the hard hitting batsmen. If the top order scored 200 runs Moors would still be all out for 225, he said. That year Felsinger and Salih were picked to represent Ceylon CA in the inaugural Gopalan trophy match against Madras (now Chennai) in India.
The division I first wicket record stood for nearly 30 years before it was broken by Tamil Union opening pair Athula Samarasekera (192) and Wayne Jansz (115) who put on 352 runs against Police SC in 1981-82.
From Moors SC, Felsinger joined NCC and then after a few seasons there he crossed over to Saracens where he opened with another famed Sri Lankan opening batsman Abdul CM Lafir. Felsinger eventually ended up playing Sara trophy cricket for BRC where he met Major-General BR Heyn, a stalwart of the club who was to change his career from cricketer to umpire.
Major BR Heyn who was administrator at the Cricket Board one day told me that I would become a very good umpire because I was cool and had a good temperament. He said everything in me was correct and that he had been watching me play cricket for one year. He told me you can play in the second division and umpire in the first division, said Felsinger.
My first match was between NCC and SSC. There was a catch attempted by the elder Ranatunga (Dammika) who scooped and caught the ball, but at once my heart said no. They appealed and I said not out. At the end of the over the fielders were crossing over and I overheard them say that was a good decision, man. At the end of three days, I got a good report and Major Heyn told me to come for all the matches and that my playing days were over.
He was the one who kept me going for a long time as an umpire. After every match he would come to me and say well done and he would also ask for the umpires report and if he found that I had erred somewhere he would say dont do that. Whenever I couldnt obtain leave he would give me a letter to release me from work.
I enjoyed my career as an umpire although I experienced some difficulties with some of my partners. They were an unscrupulous lot and never wanted to co-ordinate when umpiring. Only a handful of umpires I liked to umpire with were Errol Seneviratne, MO Gunaratne, Dooland Buultjens, a lawyer chap called Dissanayake and Elmo Gunasekera. These guys I appreciate, Felsinger said.
Although Felsinger admitted he enjoyed umpiring his heart was more on playing cricket. I enjoyed playing cricket than umpiring because playing cricket was my first love. I dreamt of playing my shots and I give due credit for it to Capt FT Badcock, the former New Zealand captain who came on a coaching assignment to Sri Lanka in 1946. He taught me how to hook and the cut shot. Those were my main strokes where I got a lot of my runs from, Felsinger said.
Felsinger worked in the banking sector having joined Mercantile Bank (later known as Hatton National Bank) straight from school as a clerk and retiring after 20 years as manager of Outer Bills department. He played and captained the bank in the inter-bank tournament where their main rivals were Hong Kong Bank.
What makes a good umpire: I will first watch his attire, secondly, he must walk to the grounds very boldly and look around and thirdly, the way he makes his decisions. If he takes a long time to make a decision its all wrong.
His heart must instantaneously say whether the batsman is out or not out once the appeal goes up. A maximum two seconds and then the decision should be given. Some of them dont adhere to all this, said Felsinger who passed away on Sunday at the age of 87.
His remains lie at his home in Mirihana and the funeral will take place (today) Wednesday at Borella Cemetery.

JAT Holding initiative to rejuvenate Temple Art
JAT Holdings has created a unique initiative to breathe new life into discarded temple flowers, it will begin production of Petal Paint  paints made from the pigment of discarded temple flowers, to be used in the restoration of sacred Temple murals.
Petal Paint is an initiative that pays homage to Sri Lankas rich heritage of Temple art, often found in the form of captivating wall murals in Temple Shrine Rooms.
The Petal Paint concept is being turned into reality by the R&D team at JAT Holdings, who will extract the vibrant, natural colors from the dry flowers and turn them into unique paints. Initially Petal Paint will be created in the three most widely used colours in Temple art  red, blue and yellow. Lotus Red, Pigeonwing Blue and Trumpet Yellow paints will thereafter be used in projects to restore and breathe new life into fading Temple murals.
The ancient art of extracting colour from a natural source like a flower is now being coupled with modern pigment extraction technology to create a one-of-a-kind paint, says Richard Gunawardene - Head of Marketing at JAT Holdings. The combined efforts of ancient knowledge and modern technology will come together to create Petal Paint, which will be used to restore one of the most beautiful art inheritances of the Sri Lankan people  the Temple murals found across our country.
The process of the Petal Paint extraction is done with maximum efficiency levels using modern hi-tech equipment. The flower offerings will be collected from various Temples across Colombo, Sri Lanka and taken through a drying process, after which their natural pigments will be extracted to create Petal Paint.

Clippity clop, clippity clop, clippity clop, went her slippers.
The reactions were varied. Some scowled, some looked at her with disapproval. Others shook their heads and looked at each other showing their disapproval.
They came home that evening, Members of the committee. They called her husband out and spoke to him in hushed tones. She cant walk in the park, they said.
Shes got diabetes, her husband whispered. She needs to walk.
No rubber slippers, they said firmly. Maybe barefoot. Less noise.
Cant cut my feet, she whispered to the walls, doctor said be careful.
You cant walk in the park, her husband said as he entered the hut.
But you are the caretaker, she whispered. You keep the park clean so that they walk well
Too much noise from your chappals, he said wearily. Cant you walk outside
She looked at him, he put his head down. He knew she had blacked out twice and was scared to go out alone. Walk barefoot, he whispered and shook his head immediately. He had been there when the doctor had read out her sugar count. Walk, said the doctor. You are lucky. You live inside Joggers Park. You can walk all the time!
She searched for shoes. People throw away their old pairs when they get a new one, she thought. The rubbish dumps yielded pairs that were too small, big or some that would have cut her feet to pieces. She found two singles. One red and the other, once white. They fitted well. She stood in front of her husband, overjoyed.
You cant, he said quietly.
Why she asked. He looked sadly at the morning walkers. They wont like those, he said.
She fished under her bed that night. What are you looking at he asked angrily as she pushed back the snap of a fifteen year old boy. Their son. It was five years. No news. I dont want to be a gardener, he had said. She had heard the slap and heard him packing that night. Dont go, she had cried. He had hugged her and left when his father slept.
What will you do she had cried out as she ran out.
Ill work as a truck cleaner ma, he had said, Ill see the world. Dont worry.
She missed him, then saw the letter.
It was from him. He drove a truck. There was a photo. He looked happy. Handsome. Ma, he asked. Do you need anything
Walking shoes, she wrote on the post card and sent it to the transport company address.
She watched the others as they walked next morning. She chuckled to herself. She looked at their shoes. Mine will be better, she thought and chuckled again.
She had another black out. Outside.
The doctor shook his head. Diabetic Coma he said. Take her to the hospital.
He took her home. She died without too much trouble. The postman brought a parcel. He tore it open. For you ma, the note said.
That evening, joggers for once stopped their walk as the funeral bier was carried out. They started again. They looked at each other. They frowned. Why would a corpse have on a pair of walking shoes they wondered.

Kane keen for strong finish with Spurs ahead of World Cup
London, Monday: Harry Kane admitted it has taken him time to recover top form after an ankle ligament injury, but believes he still has time to rediscover his best ahead of shouldering England's World Cup hopes.
Kane scored his 38th goal of the season as Tottenham Hotspur edged closer to a third consecutive season in the Champions League by opening up a five-point lead on fifth-placed Chelsea with just three games of the Premier League season to go thanks to a 2-0 win over Watford at Wembley on Monday.
But Kane was again far from his best and believes he should have scored more in a laboured Spurs performance that was characteristic of the dip in form from Mauricio Pochettino's men in recent weeks.
"Obviously, I would have liked to play better over the last few games or so but I think the whole team feel like that," said Kane.
"I feel good, I feel sharp, I probably could have scored a couple more out there today.
"I'm looking forward to the last three games. Hopefully I can finish strong like I did last year going into a big summer."
Kane was sidelined for just three weeks after suffering ankle ligament damage at Bournemouth last month.
But on top of trying to get back into top physical shape, he has also had to cope with public ridicule for claiming a goal in a 2-1 win at Stoke to aid his chances of beating Liverpool's Mohamed Salah to the Golden Boot award for the league's top scorer.
"Of course it is a mix about different things. It wasn't a great period for him the past few weeks, he is human like everyone else, and was a little bit affected," said Pochettino.
However, the Argentine has no concerns over Kane's mental toughness to lead England in Russia. An 11th defeat in their last 12 away games leaves Watford still in need of a point to mathematically secure survival.
But the visitors were left to rue a host of missed chances after matching the under-par hosts for long spells. A bright start from Watford was undone on 16 minutes when goalkeeper Orestis Karnezis spilled a simple cross from the right and Christian Eriksen teed up Alli to tap home his fourth goal in five games.
Watford had more than enough chances to be at least level at the break, but were denied by a return to form by Hugo Lloris. AFP

Lanka to christen Test venue in Australian capital
The news that Sri Lanka are going to baptise the Manuka Oval in Canberra with their first-ever Test match when they play Australia in the second of a two-Test series from February 1-5, 2019 is nothing new to a country that has being doing that around the world for quite a while since 1985.
After achieving Test status in 1981 and playing their inaugural Test the following year, Sri Lanka has been the country that other ICC full member nations have used to test their soils and popularity of their stadiums.
The Manuka Oval becomes the 15th international ground that Sri Lanka is going to baptise as a Test venue next year.
Canberra which is the capital of Australia is where the Sri Lankan High Commission is situated and the cricket authorities there are all agog with excitement that Lankan expatriates from other Australian states would fly over to Canberra to witness this first-ever Test.
The venue has to-date hosted 9 One-Day Internationals between 1992 and 2016 and Sri Lanka has played there once against India in 2008 and won the contest by eight wickets.
Manuka Oval is in the midst of an A$35 million renovation, due by the end of the decade.
The latest upgrade completed in January 2014 involved resurfacing the ground, and increasing the venues capacity to more than 15,000.
A report in one of the Australian newspapers titled: Test a jewel in Canberra crown states:
Officials are confident fans will turn up as the game recovers from the damaging ball-tampering saga with the city looking to capitalise on CAs A$1.2billion broadcast deal with Channel Seven and Fox Sports. While the Test is scheduled as a one-off, CAs leagues general manager Anthony Everard believes a packed house could pave the way for more elite content in Canberra.
Everard is banking on a full house in Canberra. He said he was very optimistic scores of Sri Lankan fans will make the trip to Canberra and snap up one of the hottest tickets in town. Theres no reason why if this Test is successful depending on what the schedule looks like in the future and the mount of content we have that we couldnt look to schedule future Test matches in this part of the world.
Australias clash with Sri Lanka in Canberra will be the second match in a two-Test series with Brisbane slated to host a day-night Test at the Gabba on January 24 beginning at 1 pm.
Its not that all 14 venues that Sri Lanka has had the privilege to play the first Test overseas are currently in use. As a matter of fact two venues in India namely  Sector 16 Stadium in Chandigarh in 1991 and KD Singh Babu Stadium in Lucknow in 1994 and one in Pakistan  Jinnah Stadium, Gujranwala in 1991 have never hosted a Test match after their first Test, while Sialkot in Pakistan in 1985 and Cuttack in India in 1987 have not hosted a Test match since 1995.
Other venues that have not hosted Tests for a long period are two from the Caribbean Islands - Arnos Vale St Vincent (first Test 1997  last Test 2014) and Providence Stadium, Guyana (first Test 2008  last Test 2011).
Venues that Sri Lanka have baptised and continue to host Test matches at present are Bellerive Oval, Hobart, Seddon Park, Hamilton, Queens Sports Club Bulawayo, Gros Islet St Lucias, Chowdhury Stadium Chittagong, Rose Bowl Southampton and Hagley Oval Christchurch.
LIST OF TEST VENUES BAPTISED BY SRI LANKA (OVERSEAS):
Pakistan v Sri Lanka  Jinnah Stadium, Sialkot 1985  last test 1995

Late President Premadasa, an epoch maker: President
Present Sri Lankan politicians are keen on realizing their own dreams rather than working to make the dreams of citizens come true, President Maithripala Sirisena said when he graced the 25th Death Anniversary commemoration of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, yesterday.
The 25th Death Commemoration of former President Ranasinghe Premadasa was held opposite his statue at the Colombo Courts Complex in Hulftsdorp yesterday under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena. The picture shows the President perusing a copy of the Dinamina Special Supplement on the late President Premadasa.
Such a personalized political culture has stemmed many issues that curb the collective effort to develop the country, President Sirisena added.
The commemoration ceremony was held opposite the late Presidents statue at Hulftsdrop in Colombo yesterday morning, with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, late President Premadasas family members, Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake, ministers, parliamentarians and other guests.
President Sirisena, addressing the gathering said the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa, in contrast to the present politicians, was an epoch maker who dedicated his life to make peoples dreams come true. Observing that the late President was a man of the poor and needy, President Sirisena said the late President had a clear and solid vision to uplift the people.
The late President Premadasa was not a representative of the elite society. He was a man of the people. He had to meet numerous challenges coming from his background. Finally, he was assassinated. Remarkable leaders such as the late President Premadasa were targets of many. That happened not only in Sri Lanka, but around the world. We have much to learn from this exceptional leadership, President Sirisena pointed out.
President Sirisena said the present Yahapalana government can draw many examples and guidelines from the vision and mission of the late President Premadasa. He also said that the Yahapalana government can bring about the social revolution that the late President strived hard for.
We should clearly understand the mandate given to the Yahapalana government in 2015. We need to concentrate on the average citizen. We should remember the kind of enthusiasm our people had to change the previous regime. We should know why the people gave us the responsibility of developing this country, President Sirisena said.
They want a government that does not repeat the errors of the ex-regime. They urge for a good society, clean politics, people-oriented approach, an office that loves and empathizes the average citizen. Of all our responsibilities, we first need to understand the political consciousness of our people, President Sirisena said.

The late President Ranasinghe Premadasa was firmly committed to a united and undivided country, Leader of the Opposition R. Sampanthan said yesterday.
He was addressing the ceremony held to commemorate the 25th Death Anniversary of the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa.
The Opposition Leader pointed out that the late President Premadasa was committed to promoting unity and harmony among all. He wanted all people to live together in one undivided indivisible country that celebrates equality, rights and justice, he pointed out.
The late President Premadasa also believed that the 13th amendment to the Constitution does not provide a solution to the ethnic issue. So he appointed a select committee to look into it and made a senior SLFP member its Chairman. It clearly showed that he wanted both the UNP and the SLFP to work together to find a solution to the national problem, Sampanthan pointed out.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya on the occasion said, I have worked closely with the late President Ranasinghe Premadasa for over 30 years. I know his expectations. He is a great example to young politicians. The late President Premadasa never considered the ethnicity, religion or political parties when serving people. He utilized skilled officers in these endeavors. He believed that the people will be content if their pockets are filled with money. So he generated employment opportunities for the people, he said.
During his time, the export sector thrived. Industries came into the country. He discussed issues in relation to development measures on a monthly basis. He had smart and skilled people around him. Accordingly, the present government is upholding a similar approach in developing the country, the Speaker said.

The Lester technique
Extracted from the Lester James Peries Oration in 2012.
Since our friendship goes back a long time I would like to begin with a reminiscence of an early meeting with Lester. He had invited me to visit Balapitiya where he was shooting scenes for Gam Peraliya in the Mahakappina Walauwa. In those days film crews were on location for long periods and had time for much fellowship and special visits from friends, and particularly from the Producer who turned up from time to time to pay the bills and make sure that the Director, his players and the technical crew did not pave the way to his premature bankruptcy.
I was lucky in that I had the privilege of making the journey from Colombo to Balapitiya in the company of Martin Wickremasinghe and Regi Siriwardena in Mr. Wickremasinghes car. I was too intimidated to participate actively in their discussions during the journey.
Anyway, Regi was rather reticent probably fearing, as it is usual in films, that once the screen play is written the novelist is unhappy that some favourite parts are left out and new episodes added. To add to the tension was the frequently expressed view of Martin Wickremasinghe that cinema cannot do justice to literary works, probably based on his experiences with South Indian films which were more than the main cinematic offerings to Sinhalese audiences.
We were invited on that day because a key scene was being shot in Balapitiya. It was the marriage scene of Nanda and Piyal. We all crowded round the verandah of the Mahakappina Walauwa; out stepped the wedding couple and I vividly remember Lester deploying his new players from the stage, namely Tony Ranasinghe, G.W. Surendra and Wickrema Bogoda to give a sense of the festive occasion. There were also several foreigners in the crowd to suggest that Piyal was now building his fortune in Colombo. Crackers went off, a prop man tugged at an overhanging decoration and confetti floated down on the couple.
Work of cinematic giants
When the film was released I eagerly looked forward to this scene, only to find that many of the details that stuck in my mind had been edited out. Nevertheless, I remember well Lesters detachment; his whispers to the cameraman and very gentle suggestions he made to the players which became a hallmark of his directorial style.
Since then we have had many pleasant meetings; many discussions. I also had the pleasure of seeing all his films from the documentaries he made for the GFU to his latest efforts. What holds his works together What common thread binds his work This is a legitimate question made contemporary by the Auteur theory which was first presented by the Cahier de Cinema group in France, and has today become a popular approach in understanding the work of cinematic giants. We look back at a large number of films of a Director all stamping a personal vision, a distinctive style and rhythm and, indeed, their cinematic language and idiom.
After all if we could see in Picasso or George Keyt a distinctive vision and style, why cannot we do the same for the masters of the moving image If we can delve into the psychology, even pathology of great painters and writers, the origins of their oeuvre, the influences on them, the effects of ideology and even of the market place and of the continuous evolution of their work, why cannot we follow the same methodology in examining the body of work of the great film directors of the world Will it not help in separating the artiste from the journey man
If we adopt the Auteur theory to look at the body of work of Lester what stands out is his humanism. Humanism has been defined as Any system, mode of thought or action in which human interest, values and dignity predominates. While similar ideologies have prevailed in many regional traditions, we are here concerned mostly about humanism as it developed in western society after the Renaissance and became a strong influence on Lester James Peries. While he progressively delved into Sinhala Society and culture he was also a cosmopolitan intellectual. A similar claim can be made about Satyajit Ray. Philip French calls Ray a great film maker rooted in his complex Bengali culture and at the same time a detached cosmopolitan intellectual.
Whatever some nationalist thinkers say, almost all the distinguished creative artists and literary figures of Sri Lanka have been largely influenced by their readings of great works of western literature. Martin Wickremasinghe, Sarachchandra, Gunadasa Amarasekera and Siri Gunasinghe have all been influential by classical western writers. We will later see the strong impact of outstanding pre-revolution Russian writers, particularly Anton Chekov, on Wickremasinghe which links him to his cinematic interpreter Lester, whose works have been described by international critics as Chekovian. Anton Chekov is the bridge between Wickremasinghe and Lester. Indeed in a later film Lester directly adopted Chekovs Cherry Orchard just as Rays Ganasatru was an adaptation of Ibsens Enemy of the People.
English literature and culture
Wickremasinghe was a voracious reader. He read the Russion classics of Tolstroy, Dosteovsky Chekov and Gorky. That fed his inherent humanism which grew out of his close observation first of village life in South Sri Lanka and later of the metropolis of Colombo, which was being transformed by the beginnings of native capitalism. Lester on the other hand was a product of the English speaking Colombo upper middle class. His father was a well to do doctor. I was always intrigued by the appearance of a grave looking doctor in Lesters films like Gam Peraliya, Nidhanaya and Madol Duwa, usually giving very rational and unhurried diagnosis, which only confirmed what the cinema audience already knew was a critical situation.
Lester with his fascination with English literature and culture of the immediate post war period was part of the English avant garde. This was a group of people like Auden, Spender and Gascoyne who were transformed by the war and contemporary ideologies. It was an aesthetic movement based on humanism which shook the foundations of an out of date, class bound English culture. This is a long and fascination story which may be nearer to us than we think, thanks to many recent publications regarding this period. For instance, we read of Tambimuttu and his desperate efforts to help many of those talented poets even though he himself lived in abject poverty.
It was not all poetry however. Due to the war effort British documentary films with their praise of the working man and woman, the young British soldiers, seamen and particularly the fighter pilots, created a new humanism - a regard for the dignity of the individual who faces great odds. This approach was seen in the work of John Grierson. Close to Independence, DS Senanayake was persuaded to set up the GFU. Its first equipment came from a group of Italians who had come to this country to shoot a feature film. Their producer had lost interest and the new government hired them to set up a Film Unit.
With time the Italians left and the British took over. Fortunately they hired superb film makers like Ralph Keene who began to travel to London for likely assistance. Many of those early film makers of the GFU like Lester James Peries, Titus Totawatte, Hettiaratchy and Irvin Dassanaike had been involved in varying degree with film making in England and brought with them a sophistication and technical competence quite different from that of the Indian film industry. Also there were other associates like Sumiththa Amarasinghe, who had studied in India.
Here is a quotation from G S Frasers. The Modern writer and his world which well describes the milieu in which young artistes including those from Sri Lanka who were plucked out to come back to their country, lived. I remember around 1946, young writers sharing sparsely furnished flats, giving parties with mulled Algerian wine and weak bitter beer, talking eagerly through the night, trying to call into existence, as if by magic, a London Literary World.
I do not have the time to go into all the details of Lesters pioneering ventures; the breakout from the GFU, Rekava as the first authentic Sinhala film, the introduction of a new film language different from the prevailing South Indian tradition, his evolution towards a depiction of local, particularly Buddhist, culture and society and the first manifestation of Sinhala film in the regional and international critical arena.
Humanistic approach
I will therefore devote the rest of my lecture to an examination of Lesters cinema based on the Martin Wickremasinghe trilogy or triptych Gam Peraliya; Yuganthaya and Kaliyugaya which illustrates the directors humanistic approach. I must say straight away that these three films have to be viewed as works of cinema and not mere translations of Wickremasinghes novels to celluloid. As John Hood remarks on a parallel relationship between Tagore and the cinema of Satyajit Ray, I have discussed all these films, not according to their worthiness or otherwise as cinematic representatives of Tagore, but as cinematic works of art by Satyajit Ray. As literature and cinema are two categorically different art forms, there seems to me to be little point in decrying the independence of one and insisting on its difference to the other. Unfortunately many of the critics of these films when they were released failed to understand such a difference. So it was also with Lesters Baddegama which led to many controversies.
Wickremasinghes three novels and Lesters three films based on them cover four generations of a Sinhalese family group with origins in the deep south. Members of the family make the transition from a small village to the top of the countrys business ladder. It is a tale which resonates with Sri Lankas social experience and psychology. While many of our Socialist oriented critics have flayed a dead horse about the emergence of capitalism, as depicted in these novels, I would submit that it is the characterization of these dramatis personae that is most remarkable and is linked to the authors close observation and deep understanding of the complexities that go to make up their lives. It is only to appreciate the unique and complex nature of the behaviour of characters before us that we glimpse the undercurrents of social changes.
Only an insensitive Marxist or an ultra nationalist will create puppets who appear and disappear according to the ideologues preferred vision. On the other hand, it is the sensitive interplay between the individual, his psychology and the evolving social background that makes for good art. Sarachchandra writing The Sinhalese Novel in 1950 made this point about Gam Peraliya. He wrote The Changing Village is a true tale of village life than anything that has appeared before. In its stark realism, it introduced us to characters whose attitude of life and mode of behaviour are unique. He presents these new types of humanity to us with a deep understanding of their psychology and the environmental conditions that served to produce such a psychology.
While the novel can always meander into anthropological and psychological commentary, a frequent technique of Martin Wickremasinghe, a film must perforce concentrate on event, action and character. As we see in the trilogy many of the subsidiary characters have been dropped and only key events have been highlighted. But it is a special characteristic of Lesters cinema, as it is of Satyajit Ray, that the director has a good lining up of the sequences which enables the viewer not to stray too far from the original story. So does the composition of the visual images that go to constitute such a sequence. He is very restrained in his camera work, frequently using the mid-shot and using close-ups only for telling effect.
In Gam Peraliya and Kali Yugaya it is the role of Nanda which is brought to the fore. It is Nanda whose dormant feelings for Piyal are squashed by the traditional mores. She accepts life with Jinadasa only to be buffeted by a series of, perhaps inevitable, events caused by changes in the wider world. In Kaliyugaya, which to me is a much better film than Yuganthaya, she is married to Piyal but a letter from her first born, Alan, from London cruelly gives a different take on the life that Piyal has created for his family in Colombo. By any standard the playing of Punya Heendeniya in these two films is outstanding. She brings an emotional charge to her role that keeps the viewer transfixed.
Wonder of human life
As a director, Lester must be given full credit for focusing on the playing of this central character. The nuances of feeling of Nanda surrounded by people who have strong and simple feelings like Anula, Piyal and Savimon Kabalana not only makes her a sympathetic character but also takes us to a world of moral choices and sensitivity of feelings which help us to take a more tolerant view of the human condition.
Who are we to pass judgment on such people who grapple with their own existential conditions Lesters compassionate but unflinching vision helps us to celebrate the wonder of human life. I am reminded of John Hoods description of Ray Quite apart from his artistic and technical brilliance, he was a film maker who celebrated humanity.

Maestro nonpareil
The passing away of Dr. Lester James Peries removes from our midst a unique personage who not only charted a path-breaking course in the field of local cinema but also put Sri Lanka on the world map with his creative prowess that brought him on par with the top names in world cinema. His creation, Nidhanaya, is considered one of the 10 all time great films in international cinema, an achievement for which the country could truly be proud of.
Lester burst on the scene like a comet taking the local cinema by storm with his first cinematic experiment Rekava (Line of Destiny) that broke the mould of the South Indian melodrama genre which was the staple that fed the local cinemagoers up until then. In wife Sumithra he had the ideal foil, the combination going onto create some unique pieces of cinema that brought in a string of international awards and acclaim. When Lester burst on the scene the country was in the throes of the cultural revolution ushered in by S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike in 1956 which also saw a re-awakening of indigenous thoughts, practices and the renaissance of a local cultural ethos.
It cannot be a coincidence that Lesters cinematic creations tended to match with the prevailing milieu and the changing winds of the times. He painted on a broad canvass, not only bringing to the fore the beauty of village life and the innocence of rural living, but also exploring the intricacies of the innermost core of the human mind and prejudices associated with the village. In Goluhadawata he brought out the innocent romance of two young hearts that had such a poignant ending that the film captivated both the young and old in equal measure. His subsequent works also dwelt on serious themes and other topics that embraced a wide gamut of social issues, politics, psychology etc. that brought with it a new breed of cinemagoer who was exposed to and learnt to appreciate serious cinema. In this he set a trend, precipitating the arrival of a whole young breed of creative cinema artistes that strove to bring about a truly indigenous cinema in this country.
One cannot speak about Lester without the mention of wife Sumithra. As already mentioned, the duo complemented each other, at times the wife surpassing the husband, so much so, one found it difficult to speak in the same breath about Lester without mention of Sumithra. This is because the themes they dwelt on were of the same genre and the creative excellence complementary. It will be the wish of all who have the best interest of the local cinema at heart to have Sumithra continue in the same vein, that would further encourage the next crop of potential exponents of serious cinema to take the cue and rescue the local cinema industry from the depths to which it has fallen today.
President Maithripala Sirisena, who last met the aging maestro on the day of his 99th birthday, at his home, and wished him many more years of life on this planet, should take concrete measures to propagate the name and works of Dr. Lester James Peries, who was a national treasure like the Nidhanaya he created. There is a national trend among us to forget things after the initial spell of heightened activity and displays of sentiment and emotion. There is little spoken of today about the doyen of indigenous music, the late W.D. Amaradeva, or, the late Premasiri Khemadasa who provided the musical score for all Lesters films, until the formers demise.
It was the fervent wish of Dr. Peries to have a state-of-the-art film archives established so that all old masterpieces could be restored and local films preserved. It is indeed a telling indictment on those responsible that Nidhanaya (among the top ten internationally acclaimed films, of all time) is lost to the present generation due to this negligence and the quest in search of a copy is yet to bear fruit.
Steps, at least should be taken now, to preserve the remainder of the unique cinematic creations of this colossus for the benefit of the generations to come so that they may come to know and appreciate the contributions of the man who was able to rub shoulders with the best of men in world cinema and bring fame and glory to the motherland.
It will also be appropriate for the authorities to give utmost attention towards the creation of a Dr. Lester James Peries Museum at an appropriate location, that incorporates his early forays into the Lankan cinema and other Lester memorabilia to propagate his memory.
Sri Lanka has lost one of her unique sons who contributed to the glory and esteem of the country far afield from our shores, as no politician has done to date. It is only fitting therefore that no stone is left unturned to further his memory, at every turn.
Dr. Lester James Peries makes his final journey today.
We salute you Sir, for your unique contribution in placing Sri Lanka on a pedestal in world cinema.

Sri Lanka fast bowler Lasith Malinga has been included to play in the SLC Super Provincial one-day tournament beginning today.
SLC CEO Ashley de Silva speaking at a press conference stated that Malinga has to first prove his fitness and form by playing cricket either at home or in the IPL.
SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala also shared his views and said that in his opinion Malinga was good for T20 cricket but it is the selectors job to select him.
If he is currently playing in the IPL the selectors will have an idea of his performance but being a bench player how can they consider him for selection, said Sumathipala. - KR

Point of view
Sri Lankan Equity markets ended the week on a negative note, reversing the positive momentum that dominated in the previous two weeks when the broad share ASPI surpassed the 6500 mark for the first time since Mid-March.
Although market activity returned to normal levels this week as investors returned to markets post the Traditional New Year holidays, the benchmark Index ended the week at 6531.06 to record an ~10 point loss W-o-W.
Despite the overall market ending on a negative note, investors remained interested in blue chip stocks over the week, helping JKH gain ~2.8% W-o-W while Dialog gained ~2.2% W-o-W.
JKH consequently accounted for ~23.4% of this weeks total turnover. Activity levels also improved this week, helping turnover hit a 3 week high of Rs.3.1Bn (cf. Rs1.3Bn last week), and pushing the daily average turnover up by ~141% W-o-W (Rs.0.62Bn cf. Rs.26Bn).
Market activity however was dominated by retail investors as Local institutional and HNI investors opted to remain on the sidelines yet again.
Local Institutional and HNI participation accounted for just ~32% (of total market turnover) during the week cf. the average of ~47% year to date. Foreign investors meanwhile, showed interest in Sri Lankan equities, helping the Bourse record a net foreign inflow of Rs.0.3Bn cf. a net foreign inflow of Rs.0.1Bn of last week.
However, higher exchange rate volatility & rupee depreciation (~LKR depreciated 2.6% year to date) in the last few weeks has remained a concern for foreign investors, and the YTD net foreign outflow amounted to Rs.0.9Bn (including LOLCs transaction for Rs.12.8Bn).
Markets in the week ahead are likely to move in line with developments on the political and economic front.
CB forecasts inflation to stabilize at 4.0%
National inflation levels in Mar18 fell to a 2-year low of 2.8% Y-o-Y, down from the 4.2% Y-o-Y recorded in Feb18.
The decline in headline inflation was driven largely by the general reduction in Food inflation (from 3.7% Y-o-Y in Feb18 to 2.6% Y-o-Y in Mar18) while Nonfood inflation increased marginally (from 2.8% Y-o-Y in Feb18 to 2.9% Y-o-Y in Mar18).
Urban inflation levels meanwhile, continued to drop in 2018 as CCPI dipped to 4.2% Y-o-Y in Mar2018 from 7.1% Y-oY in Dec2017, while core inflation also reduced to 3.4% Y-o-Y in Mar18 from 4.3% Y-o-Y in Dec17.
Lower national and urban inflation levels in 2018 (cf. Annual average 7.7% in 2017) allowed the CBSL to reduce the interest rates by 25bps at its 2nd monetary policy review for the year.
Despite the expected fuel price revision in the year, the CBSL projected urban inflation in 2018 stabilizing at 4.0%, and ~5.0% in the medium term (2019-2022). Meanwhile, the LKR experienced higher volatility this month due to greater importer dollar demand, with the LKR depreciating ~1.1% in this month so-far cf. ~0.5% in Mar18 and ~0.7% in Feb18.
The CBSL was quick to re-assure markets however, with the CBSL Governor stating that the recent FX market volatility is unwarranted as the countrys foreign reserve position remains positive, with FX reserves currently touching a record USD 10Bn as the government has just closed bids on USD 1Bn loan while the USD 0.6Bn final tranche from the Hambantota port lease is also expected (1).
So far this year, the LKR has depreciated ~2.6% against the USD, compared to a total depreciation of 2.3% during 2017.

May Day tragedies in the past
A recent news item highlighted a statement by Joint Trade Union organisation, Trade unions will hold their joint May Day meeting as usual on May 1, the Joint Trade Union said accusing the governments decision to reorganize the rallies to May 7. The government says it arrived at this pronouncement to ensure Buddhist religious activities are observed serenely during the Vesak week. Municipal Council has not granted authorization for May Day rallies to be held in public places on May 1. however, we will proceed to hold our combined rally on May 1,
May day is an alien concept, hence it cannot be declared as a public holiday. In early 1920s, A E Goonesinghes Ceylon Labour Party received the above reply from the Colonial governments Legislative Council and it was repeated by the State council in 1930s when the Marxists agitated for a holiday on May first. The workers applied for leave and marched towards rallying points even during UNP governments of 1940s and early 50s. The workers continued to forego their personal leave to attend rallies until Bandaranaike made May 1 a full holiday in 1956. Later even the UNP launched their trade union JSS under J R Jayewardene, whos members for the first time marched the streets in mid1960s.
May Day rallies
In the years gone by Marxist leaders being immersed in sweat and rain shouted themselves hoarse on May Day rallies with cries like, Down with Capitalists'; Revolution round the Corner. They demanded enhanced pay, housing, better allowances for the workers. In late 1930s the new Marxists parties were attacked by A.E. Goonesinghe's well established Trade Union. Pieter Keuneman, the Communist Party boss later recalled that they were once attacked by A.E. Goonesinghe's goons. His was the first trade union pressure group. His May Day gatherings consisted of baila singing and women dancing along the demonstration routes. Pieter, the son of a Supreme Court judge who belonged to the elitist class yet chose to unite with the working class and yell slogans asking that May Day be devoted internationally as a workers day, and be made a state holiday. He also solicited for better pay, better wages and housing, etc for the workers. It was surely a long way from the famous Cambridge University.
My earliest impressions of the LSSP on May Day was seeing the eminent lawyer-politician Dr Colvin R. de Silva and handsome Dr N M Perera the colourful characters at May Day rallies of yester-years.
Red, has been the traditional colour of the workers. It is symbolic of their sweat and blood at work. The LSSP, the CP and later the CMU wore red shirts while the women wore red saris or jackets.
However, with more workers rallying behind young educated leftists, Gunasinghes organisation died a natural death compelling the veteran labour leader to join with the UNP. The powerful Marxists parties LSSP and Communists in 40s 50s and 60s, unlike today, had their meetings dedicated to the genuine workers.
Veteran trade union leader, the late comrade Bala Tampoe, General Secretary of Ceylon Mercantile Union was a proud man in 1971. JVP insurrection on April 5- 15, compelled the United Left Front Government of the SLFP, LSSP and CP to ban May Day meetings and demonstrations in 1971. But Bala, and his Ceylon Mercantile Union decided to ignore the ban and hold a meeting on their own grounds in 22nd lane Kollupitiya. The Daily News headlines on May 2, 1971 yelled, Only CMU celebrated May Day.
Murder inside temple on banned May Day 1987
On April 21 1987, a LTTE car bomb exploded near the Pettah Bo-tree killing 122 people and severely injuring another 200 persons. Inter University Students Federation affiliated to JVP staged a demonstration the very next day opposite the Ward Place residence of President Jayewardene. They agitated for adequate security for the ordinary citizen. Two leading bikkhus, Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera and Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha led the Bhikkhu participation of the march. The government anticipating a worst situation on May Day a week later, decided to ban all meetings and rallies scheduled for May 1 using emergency laws. They suggested an alternate day on May 22, and as a further precautionary measure, the government imposed a full day curfew on first of May.
The Leftist parties and trade unions resolute to defy the ban and commemorate a Red-only May Day after the lapse of two-and a-half decades. The Maubima Surakeemay Vyaparaya [MSV] led by Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, President of the United Government Services Nurses Union, Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Naga Viharaya, Kotte, and Ven. Hedigalle Pannatissa Thera of the Agrasharavaka Dharma Faculty too decided to join the fray and held a rally and procession at the famous Abhayaramaya in Narahenpita.
The traditional Marxists left consisting LSSP and CP encouraged trade unions affiliated to them to assemble at Union Place, opposite LSSP headquarters for a demonstration. Later, they too joined a discussion that was held at the Abhayaramaya, Narahenpita, on how to defy the May Day ban. The united front included MEP Leader Dinesh Gunawardene, Dr. Colvin R. de Silva and a host of Left leaning TU leaders. In the meantime, the LSSP, Communists, SLMP of Vijaya Kumaranatunga and Vasu-Bahu led NSSP too had separate discussions on challenging the ban and holding a joint public meeting opposite the LSSP headquarters. Several other small groups too had decided on a similar course of action. On May 1, over 3,000 people attend the Abhayaramaya by 2 pm. Ven. Muruththettuwe Ananda Thera, Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, Ven. Hedigalle Pannatissa Thera, and MP Dinesh Gunawardana addressed the gathering. A ten-point May Day declaration was adopted at the convention after which the organizing committee requested the participants to peacefully disband and go away.
Certain radical sections among the crowd took to streets confronting curfew in spite of heavy presence of weapon-carrying security men around the place. The contestants walked out of the temple grounds on to the main road carrying posters and shouting slogans. The police reacted with baton charge followed by rubber bullets and teargas which failed to convey a message. They failed to control the situation and finally decided on using live bullets. Shooting continued within the holy place too. The police walked in search of curfew violators within temple buildings; later, they recovered a dead body from inside the main worship area [Buduhuge]. The two young men died of shooting included Kithsiri Ranawaka, a son of lawyer Ranawaka, the Vice President of MEP, and an undergraduate.
President Premadasa disparaged May Day by making it a workers festival in late 1980s. He invited singers and film stars from India and transported bus loads of people from the outstations, followed by the SLFP making a mockery of May Day, a day dedicated to the workforce of the world where the slogan was workers of the world unite.

Mayweather legacy faces challenge from Thai dwarf giant
Bangkok, Tuesday: After a career laden with belts, cash and kudos, boxing great Floyd Mayweather Jr retired undefeated over 50 fights -- but his flawless record faces an unlikely challenge from an obscure Thai fighter known as the "dwarf giant".
At 5ft 2in (1.57m) and weighing just 105lb (47.6kg), minimumweight Wanheng Menayothin is shorter, leaner and significantly less wealthy than Mayweather, who briefly emerged from retirement last year to fight MMA star Conor McGregor for a $100 million purse. If Wanheng triumphs on Wednesday afternoon he will equal Mayweather's feat of winning 50 successive fights.
His WBC minimumweight belt is on the line against Panamanian challenger Leroy Estrada.
The fight, to be held outside the town hall of second-tier Thai city Nakhon Ratchasima, has none of the glitz or pay-per-view pull of a Mayweather bout in Las Vegas.
But still Wanheng will enter boxing lore with victory -- and, at 32 years of age, has time to go one better and match the 51 wins, one draw and no losses set by Mexican flyweight Ricardo Lopez.
It is not just the box office power that differentiates Mayweather from the Thai, who turned to the ring at the age of 12 as a path out of poverty. AFP

Minister appreciates work of Health TUs
Health and Indigenous Medicine Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said that bureaucratic management within the Health Ministry is a major problem.
The Minister made this observation yesterday participating at a May Day event organised by the Health Sector trade unions.
Minster Senaratne said he appreciated the health trade unions for getting together to fight for the rights of workers irrespective of their political differences.
"Health trade unions had different views on the SAITM issue and it was impossible to make them all agree to one solution. It is a really healthy sign to see all health trade unions getting together to fight for a common cause," he said.
Minister Senaratne said that he always tried his best to implement the proposals made by the trade unions.
"I could not implement some requests due to the prevailing bureaucracy with in the ministry. It is a problem for me as well. Bureaucratic management is a barrier to the progress of the health sector. Some officers do not deliver a satisfactory service,"the Minister said.
Minister Senaratne further emphasised the need to defeat the prevailing bureaucracy.
"I will take the responsibility regarding the decisions that I make. I am not scared to do that. I will always take initiatives to implement the requests made by the trade unions.But, the decisions that are made cannot be efficiently implemented without the support of the Ministry officials," he said.

One million houses to become solar energy generators
Our endeavour is to transform the roofs of one million houses in the country into solar energy generators, Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya said.
He was addressing the gathering after providing solar energy panels to the Main Muslim Jumma Mosque at Palliporuwa, Hemmathagama on April 28.
Minister Siyambalapitiya said providing solar energy is a step in the right direction, taken the national interest into account.
The programme will be expedited, dubbing it a solar energy war.
Although hydrel reservoirs, coal and fuel were used to generate electricity, we have been far behind in tapping solar power for electricity.
As such, priority had now been given for utilising solar power to generate electricity. Solar energy panels will be provided to places of religious worship in an effort to create awareness among people to set up such panels in their houses, he said.
Muslim Mowlavis, officers of the Hemmathagama police station and the Grama Niladhari were among the large gathering present.

Over 850 excise raids conducted during Vesak season
Excise Department officials in an effort to prevent excise crimes and misuse of excise permits during the 2018 Vesak Festival Season conducted 850 raids during the period April 27 to 30 and detected 778 excise crimes, Deputy Excise Commissioner and Media spokesman Kapila Kumarasinghe said.
Among them were 26 cases of illegal production of liquor spirits, 191 cases of illegal liquor sales and 395 cases of excessive possession or transport of liquor. The other detections included 22 cases of illegal possession of heroin, 36 cases of illegal possession of ganja, 26 cases of smoking in public places, 24 cases of smuggled foreign cigarettes and 58 cases falling under the NATA act.
The release said 670 suspects arrested during these detections were released on excise bail and legal action would be filed against them in magistrates courts within the next week.
A special feature is that an analysis of these crimes shows a marked reduction in such cases in the Northern, Eastern and North Central provinces and escalation in other parts of the country. Only 5 cases of illegal liquor sales were detected in liquor shops with permits.
The raids were conducted by several teams of officers under the direction of Excise Commissioner General R. Semasinghe and Deputy Commissioner M.B.Wansuriya.

Prassanna Pathmanathan honoured with  Global Peace Ambassador award
The Sustainable Development Accelerator and the 2nd Global Business Leadership Forum 2018 recently took place at the ITC Grand Central in Mumbai, India on April 7, 2018.
The event was heralded as a Global Leadership forum and the largest business award platform which recognizes and felicitates businesses and business leaders, entrepreneurs, start-ups, peace activists and other such individuals who have showcased a level of change through their avenue of work.
Organized in conjunction with the Unified Brainz of India, the World Peace & Diplomacy Organization and in association with The Hindu Business Line, the event gathered recipients from across the globe and included professional, models, actors and directors to name a few, from more than 15 countries.
One of these countries included Sri Lanka, where a number of Sri Lankan recipients were emphasized for their contribution in their respected careers. Amongst them was Prassanna Pathmanathan, who was awarded the Global Peace Ambassador Award at the event. He was recognized for his contribution to humanitarian and voluntary services through the many motivational and career guidance seminars that he conducts around Sri Lanka with the title Make it Happen.
The aim of an awarding platform of this caliber allows for national recognition to be commended for the achievements and contributions from individuals across diverse business, entrepreneurial and creative disciplines.
Such a platform also serves as an example and an incentive for youth in countries like Sri Lanka to channel their energies towards the right direction and prompt them to create a positive change in their community and beyond.
Pathmanathans recent win shone light on his impressive abilities and credentials that has elevated his professional approach to the work he does. Well-known amongst the corporate fraternity as an international corporate trainer, creative entrepreneur, a consultant in the fields of marketing, public relations and fashion, a motivational speaker, lecturer and personal coach, Pathmanathan is also trilingual.
He has been instrumental in conducting engaging training programs for over 110 companies and has trained participants from more than 75 countries to date; ranging from countries such as the United Kingdom, Australia, Egypt, India, Singapore, Malaysia and the Philippines. His practical approach to training programs, etiquette programs and grooming sessions are well recognized among professionals in the corporate world.
When asked about his inspiration behind the launch of the Make it Happen programs, Pathmanathan added, I launched Make It Happen for the very reason of giving back to society and to use my skills to help people, schools, universities, youth and women in rural villages, motivate the down-trodden and uplift them towards achieving an avenue of sustenance. Whilst I train many corporate clients for a fee, I felt the need to reach out to those who were in dire need of motivation but could not afford it due to poverty. This thought prompted me to reach out to those who no doubt need such a form of elevation and offer the best of myself, on an en gratis basis.
Pathmanathans reason for initiating the Make it Happen program was not aimed towards garnering recognition and all who associated with him encouraged him to raise its purpose to the public in order to request for more support from those who wish to contribute towards his worthy cause.
This could be steered in the form of a national initiative, to give people a better life. Further, I wish to drive this endeavour through social media to urge generous donors to consider the plight of those who yearn for a brighter future, he added.
At the Global Business Leadership Forum 2018, Pathmanathan was also invited to deliver a talk on Humanitarian Action and Pursuit of Peace and joined a renowned panel of distinguished business leaders, social activists and corporate big-wigs who also contributed as part of the events proceedings.
The event presented Excellence Awards which covered a number of significant categories such as World Peace Ambassador and Messenger Title Awards to name a few. These were bestowed onto social activists from around the world and those who have initiated and carried on the agenda of global peace in their respective countries and fields.
The Chief Guest at the awards ceremony was the First Lady of Maharashtra, Amruta Fadnavis. Fadnavis was also invited to unveil a book titled World Peace & Diplomacy, The Concept Unfolded authored by Prof. Dr. GD Singh, Founder & President of WPDO, witnessed by eminent guests and diplomats where a large contingent were present from Sri Lanka, which also happened to be the partner country. The event also saw Amruta Fadnavis being bestowed and honoured with the title of the WPDO World Peace Ambassador.

Hinduism features of Polonnaruwa period
Remains of a civilisation
Several South Indian invasions took place during the late Anuradhapura period. As a result, Hinduism gained ground in Sri Lanka. Opening years of Polonnaruwa period started with Chola regime. The Chola regime lasted at Polonnaruwa for more than five decades. Following this Chola period, 157 years of Buddhist rule existed. After the Buddhist rule two decades of Kalinga, Magha period existed.
Cholas administered Sri Lanka as a province of Chola empire, under the name of Mummudi-Chola -Mandalam. Mummudi-Chola was a well-known title of Chola king Rajaraja I. Opening years of Polonnaruwa period in Sri Lankan history started with Chola regime. The recoveries of Chola inscriptions from Mantai have provided some important clues and valuable information about the expansion of the Chola Kingdom from South India to ancient Sri Lanka. It seems that often Cholas sent their officials to the occupied areas in ancient Sri Lanka to coordinate the administration. The Chola areas of ancient Sri Lanka were referred to as Mummudi Chola Mandalam.
Exclusive patterns
The Chola invaders had built typical Hindu temples according to the Dravidian architecture. During the Polonnaruwa period, the Chola regime or dynasty was dominating in South India. Yet it is worthy to mention here that Polonnaruwa period architectural structure had certain unique and exclusive patterns. Majority of the Hindu temples were built only during the Polonnaruwa period. Numerous Hindu bronze statues were installed in the Hindu temples in the Polonnaruwa period.
The bronze statues of the period were considered as some of the best sculptural creations in the world. During the Chola occupation of ancient Sri Lanka, they influenced the Sri Lankan art, culture and religion. During their occupation, they built numerous Hindu temples at Mathota, Polonnaruwa and several other areas of the island. According to historical evidence, Cholas made a lot of endowments to the Buddhist monasteries. Discoveries of many engraved early historic stone inscriptions were found at various locations of Polonnaruwa. The great extent of South Indian Hindu influence started in Sri Lanka especially during the opening years of the Polonnaruwa period. During the Polonnaruwa period, numerous Hindu temples were built in and around the capital city of Polonnaruwa and its vicinity.
The Hindu culture, its dominance and the traces of Hinduism introduced during the Chola period could still be found in numerous existing forms, especially in the form of stone inscriptions, Hindu icons (including bronze and stone sculptures), decorative dance sculptures, general sculptural dance poses and Hindu Dravidian architectural structures. All these provide meaningful evidence to the masses to gather information about the Hindu cultural influence during the Polonnaruwa period.
The Chola style structure and building decorations of Polonnaruwa resembled the typical South Indian influences. Despite, such architectural styles, structure and building decorations had certain close affinities and links with the earlier Buddhist rule. It reveals the admixture of Buddhist and Hindu architectural structures, style and patterns.
Architecture and tradition
Chola administration in Polonnaruwa was marked with a Hindu revival and construction of several Siva and Visnu Kovils (shrines), with Chola architecture and tradition.
To signal the conquest of Sri Lanka, under the instructions of King Rajaraja, officers constructed a stone temple of Siva in Polonnaruwa and another at Mathottam. According to Chola inscriptions, many Hindu temples dedicated to Siva and Visnu were erected in and around Polonnaruwa. From these temples, many forms of images of Saiva and Vaisnava have been recovered. It can be said that there was a co-existence of twin worship of Lord Siva and Sri Maha Visnu worship prevailed during the Chola dynasty in Sri Lanka.
The Visnu statues are generally divided into three different categories based on their appearance. They include standing, sitting and sleeping (reposing position) which is popularly known as Ananda Sayanam in Sanskrit. The ancient Maha Visnu statues found in Sri Lankan Polonnaruwa archaeological sites are depicted in standing positions only.

The right of tax payer to act via an authorized representative under new Inland Revenue Act - Suresh R.I. Perera
The new Inland Revenue Act, unlike the repealed Act, has granted the Commissioner General of Inland Revenue (CGIR)the discretion to specify the circumstances under which a tax payer could be represented via an authorized representative.
Section 115 of the Inland Revenue Act No. 24 of 2017 which provides the discretion reads as follows.
The Commissioner-General may specify the circumstances under which a taxpayer may designate an authorized representative to communicate with the Department on behalf of the taxpayer and shall accept a designation made in accordance with such circumstances.
Above Section generated much apprehension and was looked upon with fraught by many as this posed a threat to the rights of the tax payers. Perhaps due to the concerns expressed by many, the recent Gazette notice issued specifying the circumstances a tax payer may make representations through an authorized representative has been formulated very broadly.
It provides the opportunity to every tax payer to correspond with tax office regarding registration, apply for private rulings, and provide information requested and make appearances via an authorized representative. In addition a tax payer may file the income tax return & capital gains returns also via an authorized representative.
The Gazette also permits a tax payer to request for extension of time to file a return and extension of time for making tax payments via an authorized representative.
The new Act unlike previous Act has provided the facility for a tax payer to request additional time to file the income tax return & obtain extensions for making payments going beyond the applicable due dates under certain circumstances.
The new Act has replaced the concept of preferring an appeal to CGIR by a tax payer and reduced the process to a mere administrative review upon an application by the tax payer. The recent Gazette permits the tax payer to make representations via an authorized representative in an administrative review by the CGIR.
Furthermore a tax payer could be represented via a representative in an investigation by the Inland Revenue Department too.
Perhaps the main feature of the recent Gazette is that it attempts to retain the status quo under the repealed Act in relation to the right of the tax payer to act on behalf of the person. This has been ensured by including a clause which empowers the tax payer, by writing to authorize the representative to act on for any other purpose whatsoever.
Due to this very broad parameter, one could opine that the right of the tax payer to be represented via an authorized representative has not been impaired due to the power vested on CGIR by section 115 of the new Act.

Salah wins writers footballer of the year award
London, MONDAY: Mohamed Salah was Tuesday named as the Football Writers' Association Footballer of the Year for 2017/18 after scoring 43 goals so far in an incredible debut season for Liverpool.
The Egypt international narrowly topped the poll of the 400-strong FWA membership ahead of Manchester City midfielder Kevin De Bruyne, the margin understood to be less than 20 votes.
Tottenham striker Harry Kane was third.
Between them, Salah, signed by the Reds from Roma last summer, and De Bruyne, who helped City claim the Premier League title with five games remaining, collected more than 90 per cent of the journalists' votes.
Salah has scored 43 goals in 48 appearances in all competitions this season and spearheaded Liverpool's push towards a potential place in the Champions League final -- the Reds lead Roma 5-2 ahead of Wednesday's semi-final second leg in Italy.
The 25-year-old, who was last month crowned the Premier League's Players' Player of the Year, becomes the first African winner of the FWA accolade, which has been awarded since 1948. AFP

Singer (Sri Lanka) A-(lka); Outlook Stable: Fitch
Fitch Ratings has affirmed Sri Lanka-based consumer-durables retailer Singer (Sri Lanka) PLCs National Long-Term Rating at A-(lka) with a Stable Outlook.
Fitch has also affirmed the National rating on Singers outstanding senior unsecured debentures at A-(lka). A full list of rating actions is at the end of this commentary.
The affirmation of Singers rating reflects our view that its net leverage, defined as lease-adjusted net debt/operating EBITDAR (excluding the finance subsidiary), will improve and remain below the negative trigger of 5.5x over the medium term after it deteriorated to 5.5x by end-2017 from 4.3x in 2016 amid a weak operating environment. We expect the improvement in its leverage to be supported by a recovery in sales volumes. Singers rating also reflects its leading position in the retailing of consumer durables, its extensive product and brand portfolio across different price points and its well-managed hire-purchase business.
Recovery in Sales Volumes: Fitch believes the demand for consumer durables will recover in the medium term as consumers adjust to higher costs, earnings in the agricultural sector recover, personal taxes stay low and interest rates remain stable. Singers consumer electronics and home appliance revenue growth slowed to 1% in 2017 after two years of double-digit growth on weak demand due to a prolonged drought in the country, which affected the livelihood of a significant proportion of the population, and an increase in indirect taxes. Fitch believe Singer was able to better respond to the weak demand compared with peers due to its more defensive product portfolio and strong brand presence.
Growth in IT, Digital Media: Fitch expects Singer IT and mobile segment to be the key growth driver in the medium term, aided by increasing smartphone penetration in the country and short replacement cycles compared with most other consumer durables. Singer is currently the largest smartphone retailer in Sri Lanka Singers IT and digital media revenue has grown at a CAGR of about 57% over the last five years.

Current administrators to continue as interim body
SLC elections postponed for May 31
The much awaited elections of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) will take place on May 31 following a legal issue that forced them to postpone it from being held as scheduled on May 19.
At a press conference held at SLC headquarters yesterday, SLC president Thilanga Sumathipala said that he will appoint a special election committee on May 19 at a special general meeting according to the directive given by the Minister of Sports Faizer Mustapha and then conduct the election on May 31.
In the meantime he said the Minister of Sports had approved the present administration of SLC to continue as an acting interim committee from April 27 to May 31 until the elections are held.
Speaking further Sumathipala the incumbent president stated that he was the most qualified and suitable candidate for the post of presidency.
During my presidency I have proved by bringing SLC to a profitable status when they had suffered heavy financial losses when I took over, said Sumathipala.
There are 61 affiliated clubs who nominated my name out of 84. They have trust in me, and my team. Many have questioned my eligibility for the SLC presidency. Yes, I was a founder and owner of a newspaper but at present I am not involved in any activities in the media field. They also blamed me that I was engaged with a sport good business but it was my wife who was engaged in it. Because of this a few years ago when I came forward to contest my nomination was rejected.
The newspaper was formed in 1986 and I became a vice president of SLC in 1995. I was totally away from the business according to the SLC constitution, he said.
When I took over the SLC presidency we were in debt for nearly Rs. 5 million. I have now made SLC a profitable organization with almost Rs. 2 million in profits.
We have done immense changes to SLC and our affiliated members are also well aware of it, thats why so many clubs have shown their support by nominating me for the presidency once again. Our main concern is the forthcoming Cricket World Cup. We have to work out a plan and target. We have a clear vision in everything we do, Sumathipala said.

Sri Lankan refugee family face deportation
The fate of a Sri Lankan asylum-seeker family from central Queensland will be decided in a Melbourne court on Wednesday, with a refugee council prepared to step in if they face deportation.
Lawyers for Tamil couple Nadesalingam and Priya, who have two Australian-born daughters, will appear before the Federal Circuit Court, eight weeks after the family was taken from its Biloela home and placed in detention.
Tamil Refugee Council spokesman Aran Mylvaganam said they were extremely concerned the familys appeal would fail and theyd be deported
We are preparing to stop a potential deportation through other means, he told AAP.
All we know is the system is set to fail Tamil asylum seekers. We have seen a lot of Tamil cases fail.
Mylvaganam said the relationship between the Australian and Sri Lankan governments meant Sri Lankan took back their refugees who come to Australia by boat unlike other countries such as Iran.
Nadesalingam and Priya came to Australia by boat separately and settled in Biloela on a bridging visa, which has since expired.
Nadesalingam was getting ready for work at the local meatworks and their two-year-old daughter Kopika and 10-month-old baby Tharunicaa were in bed when border officials came to the house on March 5, giving them 10 minutes to pack.
A week later the family was taken to Perth Airport and put on a plane to deport them to Sri Lanka until last minute legal intervention saw them removed.
A rally will be held to support the family at the Flagstaff Gardens in Melbourne on Wednesday morning.
Family friend Angela Fredericks, who will be at the rally with other Biloela residents, said the family had been uplifted by the huge national support but admits they are struggling in detention.
Kopika keeps crying and asking when they will go back to Biloela Ms Fredericks told AAP.
She said many people in their small town remain in disbelief about the familys removal. They are a family who work here, who want to invest in this town. Wheres the sense Supporters have been asked to bring cardboard cockatoos to the rally, a symbol of the town.

The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Sri Lanka has partnered with the National Youth Services Council (NYSC), Cisco and Citi to conduct e-learning programmes in 20 locations across Sri Lanka to build on national priorities placed on strengthening the knowledge on Information and Communication Technology skills among youth.
eLearning is a powerful tool that has the potential to connect the youth of Sri Lanka to up-to-date learning material to equip youth with the right tools to contribute to the sustainable development of the country. This innovative mode of learning will also support in developing the entrepreneurial skills of youth, thus providing them with the ability to positively contribute towards the economy.
Speaking about the impact of this programme, Jorn Sorensen,UNDP Sri Lanka Country Director, said, We are very pleased to introduce this programme together with NYSC, Cisco and Citi to support the digital capacity of young people in Sri Lanka. As a crucial segment of society, we believe that engaging with young entrepreneurs to provide better access to market information and business skills, and a better enabling environment for youth-led enterprises is the best way forward to achieve inclusive and participatory sustainable development.
The e-Learning programme will engage approximately 1000 youth through the National Youth Services Council network island wide, who will have an opportunity to the Cisco eLearning course on Entrepreneurship. The programme will run as a two-day workshop engaging 50 participants at each youth center.
Furthermore, 40 best performers from this pool of participants (assessed at the end of the session) will also be given an opportunity to engage with the youth center instructors as Volunteer Instructor Assistants to expand this initiative further to other young people within the community.
Commenting on the e-learning module, Murugan Vasudevan, Regional Manager  South Asia for Cisco said, Entrepreneurship skills are critical to create the jobs of the future, many of which also require digital skills. Cisco is excited to be able to partner with the United Nations to offer the Entrepreneurship course with interactive, online case studies to show how one can apply digital skills to start a business. An added feature of this programme will be the training on Financial literacy for Young Entrepreneurs, facilitated by Citi staff who will volunteer as resource persons.
Speaking about this partnership Ravin Basnayake, Citi Country Officer Sri Lanka said, We are proud to be partnering with UNDP on this project to enhance technology skills of our youth. We strongly believe technology is a key enabler for inclusive development and recognizes the crucial role of the youth in creating a prosperous Sri Lanka.
Young people play a key role in shaping the 2030 development agenda. Hence, engaging with them at a community level is vital if the call for participation, inclusion, accountability and engagement embedded in the Sustainable Development goals are to be achieved.
Speaking about this, Eranda Weliange, Chairman of NYSC said,Young people are active drivers of change in local communities. I am confident that this programme will enable young people in this country to advocate for change both within their communities and beyond.

US exports to China  hit record
The US exports to China grew faster than its export growth to the rest of the world, according to a report from the US-China Business Council released.
The US exported nearly US$128 billion of goods to China in 2017, more than ever before and making China the third-largest US goods export market, trailing Canada and Mexico, according to the USCBCs 2018 annual report on state exports. US goods exports to China declined slightly in 2015 and 2016.
The US exported nearly US$128 billion of goods to China in 2017, more than ever before and making China the third-largest US goods export market
For US services exports, China has become a major market and is virtually tied with Canada as the second-largest market, at close to US$53 billion.
Despite trade barriers that frustrate full market access, US exports to China continue to contribute to US economic growth, said John Frisbie, president of USCBC, which represents more than 200 US companies doing business in China.
Exports to China support 1 million American jobs annually across a wide range of industries, Frisbie said in a press release.
Forty-nine US states have expanded their goods exports to China over the past decade, with 17 states experiencing triple-digit growth. Every US state has had triple-digit services export growth to China over the past decade, with 31 states experiencing services export growth of more than 300 percent, according to the report.
The report shows that US goods exports to China have grown by 86 percent over the last decade, compared with only 21 percent to the rest of the world.
In the decade from 2007 to 2016, US services exports to China grew by 12 percent, compared with a decline of 0.6 percent to the rest of the world.
China is among the top five goods and services export markets for most US states. China was the top goods export market for five states in 2017, and among the top five markets for 46 states. In services exports, China was the top market for 18 states in 2016, and a top five market for all 50 states, according to the report.
In 2017, 30 US states exported more than US$1 billion in goods to China, and 15 states exported more than US$1 billion in services to China in 2016. In 2008, only 21 states exported more than US$1 billion of goods to China and in 2007 only three states exported more than US$1 billion in services to China.
The report comes just days before US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin will lead a delegation to China for trade talks to ease the escalating tensions triggered by US unilateral tariff measures.
The US has announced and threatened tariffs on US$150 billion worth of imports from China following a Section 301 investigation into Chinas intellectual property policies and practices. China has proposed retaliatory tariffs and vowed to fight to the end.
Many in China, the US and other parts of the world are worried about the devastating consequences of a possible trade war or major tit-for-tat retaliations between the worlds two largest economies.
US President Donald Trump announced last week that he is sending a US delegation to Beijing, a trip he described as having a very good chance of making a deal.
The White House on Monday announced that the US delegation will include Mnuchin, US Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer, White House National Economic Council Director Larry Kudlow, White House trade advisor Peter Navarro, US Ambassador to China Terry Branstad and Deputy Assistant to the President for International Economic Affairs Everett Eissenstat.
In an interview on Fox News aired Monday morning, Mnuchin said he is cautiously optimistic about his meetings in China on Thursday and Friday.
He said he doesnt want to predict whats going to happen or not going to happen on the trip. Were going to go over there and well have very frank discussions, he said.
Mnuchin noted trade imbalances and intellectual property rights are among the issues to be discussed.
Trump has constantly blamed US trade partners, especially China, for the trade deficits, while most economists believe they are caused mostly by the US fiscal policies, low savings rates, the role of the US dollar as a global reserve currency and Trumps tax cut plan.
Hopefully well make significant progress. Were going to make progress, Mnuchin said of the Beijing trip.
China has welcomed the visit by the US delegation. Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said last Friday that we are willing to hold negotiations with the US on the basis of mutual respect and equality. (Chinadaily)
