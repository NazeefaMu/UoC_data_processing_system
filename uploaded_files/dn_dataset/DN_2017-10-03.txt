Business ethics a must subject for universities
Both the public sector and the SME sector should try to improve their PR and business ethics, said Senior Lecturer in Philosophy attached to the Faculties of Humanities and Social Science, University of Sri Jayewardenepura, Dr. Asha Nimali Fernando.
She said that today its a well-accepted fact that most of the public sector is not customer friendly.
This has to change and I think one of the best ways to overcome this is to try to infuse a private sector mindset to the employees in the government sector. It would also be a good idea that workshops in public relations should be conducted for the public sector to improve their communication skills which will ultimately also help the productivity of their workplace as well.
She said that today one of the main reasons for the public sector to lag behind is that they have very little respect not only towards a customer but also to their superiors. This may be because the employee may have political clout or their immediate boss may have been appointed politically and may not have the qualification to hold the job, thereby losing respect for the superior.
She also said that in the state sector institutions the boss mostly acts like a baby sitter and this attitude too should change. "Bosses should have the knowledge as well as ability to extract the skill of a worker and put them to use.
Fernando with two master degrees, one from India's University of Mysore and the other in Western Philosophy from the University of Pali and Buddhist Studies of Sri Lanka and a PhD in Moral Philosophy from the University of Erlangen in Nuremberg, Germany, said that administrators must address this issue from a psychology point of view to create good work culture in public enterprises.
Since most of the employees in the public sector comes from universities it would also be a good idea to conduct workshops in PR skills, business ethics (marketing/advertising) for undergraduates at the final years of their university education.
In most developed countries, a university's management faculty will have a compulsory subject named, Business Ethics, she said.
Having worked as a research assistant at the University of Erlangen, Germany and University of Stuttgart, also in Germany, she said that in Western countries there is no difference between the work culture of a private or public enterprise and a customer would never know if he or she is in a private or public enterprise.
Commenting on the SME sector, she said that in most areas their public relations too is low. This is especially evident when it comes to the environment; respect from the SME sector towards safeguarding of the environment is low."
When it comes to the sale of their own product most of them have the attitude, if you want, you buy which is not customer friendly.
However she said that in the hotel sector there is great discipline from the employees and this is one key factor for the success of tourism.

SAARC countries have not made right decisions to get out of poverty trap
Every budget since Independence has pledged to assist the private sector, but to date that has not happened, said Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Minister of Special Assignments.
Speaking at the inauguration of the certified professional managers (CPM) regional management conference held at BMICH recently, he said that there is a small paragraph in every budget, sometimes in small type, saying that we consider the private sector to be the motor of growth.
But if you look at the financial allocations, if you look at the policy prescriptions, that pledge is hardly carried over to real life.
Commenting on the SAARC region, the Minister said that all member countries are bound together by the SAARC Charter and advances in one country are always an advance for other member countries. SAARC is one of the largest gatherings population-wise and represents more than one quarter of the worlds population.
We are a region which is nuclear combat ready. So it is very important that we work together, particularly to make sure that all of us come out of the poverty trap. Though we are large in numbers, almost all our countries are on a growth path. Bangladesh, today, is a good example of economic growth for many of us in the region.
He said that it is fair to say that in South Asia we all choose to be poor. If we look at our countries, our history and our decision making, we refrain from taking those decisions which can help our countries to be much better, to be richer.
We have not taken those decisions that were necessary particularly in the area of administration and as a result we are today what we are. We have to admit that we can do much better. We can be much more responsive to the poorer people of our societies and, to some extent, we can say that several generations of leaders have let down large numbers of poor people in our countries.
The SAARC is not we managing their resources properly. Are the people of our countries getting a return that they have every right to expect from their natural resources, their human resources and from new technology I think all of us will have to look into this matter and I feel that much more can be done.
We are not taking the correct decisions to transform our economy. Now if you look at our neighbour India and another billion population country, China, one would have thought that they would have never transformed themselves. So that is why I say we are deliberately choosing to be poor - because we are not addressing the proper issues.

Suraksha scheme, a milestone in the education sector: PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe called the launch of the health insurance scheme for students, the third most significant programme in the education system of the country since the introduction of the free education system by former Education Minister C.W.W. Kannangara in 1942.
Addressing the launch of the student health insurance scheme Suraksha at Temple Trees yesterday he explained that Kannangaras initiative removed the major economic hurdle to education and in 1980, President J R Jayewardena, through the introduction of free text books, further improved on it. In 2017, under President Maithripala Sirisenas government, a child can have access to a healthy and secure education.
Thus, after the introduction of free education, 75 years later, the government headed by President Sirisena has introduced the 3rd major step, said the Prime Minister.
The government will invest Rs 2700 million in the program, according to the Prime Minister. Sri Lanka has become one of the few countries in the world which sticks to the UN charter on access to education for all, he added. Children are the future of the nation and if there are any economic hurdles to education, we need to remove it, said Wickremesinghe. The Prime Minister further explained that as the government has managed to stabilize the economy, more programmes to secure free education would be rolled out. Other such programmes include; the closest school is the best school initiative, the increase of teachers salaries by Rs 10,000, the construction of 200,000 government houses and the creation of 400,000 jobs, according to the PM.
The insurance scheme alone will not ensure that all problems in the education system would be solved. We also want to ensure compulsory 13 years of education and from 2018 onwards we will provide students with tabs. In addition, we have also designed a special training programmes for English teachers, said Wickremesinghe.
The President, Minister of Education and I are products of the free education system and so we know the value of it and the responsibility of protecting it', added the PM.

58 killed, 515 wounded in Las Vegas shooting
Fifty-eight people are now known to have been killed in a mass shooting at an open air concert in Las Vegas while another 515 were wounded, police said Monday.
The number of people who have died associated with this event has increased. Right now were using the number of 58, Las Vegas Sheriff Joseph Lombardo told reporters.
The number of injured -- we are using the number of 515. A gunman, named as 64-year-old Stephen Paddock, opened fire from the 32nd floor of the Mandalay Bay Hotel toward an open-air music festival.
Police said a suspect identified as a local resident was shot and killed by officers. They said they were looking for a companion travelling with the suspect as a person of interest. See pages 12 and 17
Sheriff Joe Lombardo said police believed the shooting was a lone wolf style attack, but confirmed they were trying to locate an Asian female named as Marilou Danely.
Sheriff Lombardo said he was unable to accurately say the number of dead and injured, but confirmed two off-duty officers were among those killed.
A local hospital spokesperson said earlier that at least 14 of the injured were in a critical condition.
There had been reports of other incidents at different locations along the Las Vegas strip, but police said those reports were false. Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired. Hundreds of people fled the scene and the sound of what appeared to be prolonged automatic gunfire could be heard on videos posted on social media. Many hotels on the Las Vegas strip close to the scene remain on police lockdown as they search for two vehicles in relation to the attack. Witnesses reported that hundreds of shots were fired. A witness told the BBC that he saw people running in total panic.
One man had blood all over him and thats when I knew something was seriously wrong. People were running and there was chaos. Some flights were diverted after news of the incident emerged. - BBC NEWS

728 refugees in shelter in Sri Lanka: Mahinda Samarasinghe

There are 728 refugees in Sri Lanka now under the care of UN Refugee Agency, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
The Minister, addressing a press conference at the SLFP Headquarters in Colombo today, said they belong to 10 countries and majority of them are Pakistani nationals.
Bringing out the statistics of refugees in Sri Lanka as at August 31, 2017, the Minister said there are 533 Pakistani nationals, 113 Afghanistan nationals, 35 Myanmar nationals, 14 Syrian nationals, 10 Palestine nationals, 8 Maldivian nationals, 7 Iranian nationals, 6 Yemen nationals and one each from Somalia and Tunisia among them.
At the same time there are 605 asylum seekers in Sri Lanka pending the refugee status of the UNHCR.
Among them are 504 Pakistani nationals and 77 Afghanistan nationals.
He said the UNHCR has undertaken the responsibility to send them to a third country as soon as possible.
Asked by a journalist as to where these refugees are presently located, the minister said he was not aware. I dont know, but the Government must be aware. I will inquire and let you know, the Minister replied.
The Minister pointed out that Sri Lanka is not party to the 1951 UN Refugee Convention along with India, Pakistan and many other countries, and therefore not bound to keep refugees permanently.
Despite that we look at humanitarian aspect of the issue and act in keeping with the international law.
The Sri Lankan Government has signed a Status Agreement in 2005 with the UNHCR and according to it the UNHCR is bound to send them to a third country as soon as possible, he said.
He also said the Government acted responsibly during the recent agitation near the refugee shelter at Mount Lavinia that housed 31 Rohingya refugees, adding that the arrests made following the incident showed that the Government acts swiftly against the law breakers.

ACCA extends MoU with University of Colombo for BBA in Accounting
The Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA) Sri Lanka, has over the past few years been building partnerships with local universities through a series of MoUs, in an attempt to better prepare local students for the changing job market, that calls on professionals with skills and expertise that combines both theoretical and practical knowledge.
Having had a long standing relationship with the University of Colombo, ACCA recently extended their MoU to further strengthen the partnership between the two educational entities that will enable them to work together to grant exemptions for the graduates, which in turn will give them an edge in their profession by helping them gain specialist knowledge and accountancy skills and managerial skills that are on par with global standards.
The recent MoU in addition to offering a host of attractive opportunities for students of the Bachelor of Business Administration (BBA) in accounting degree of the University of Colombo, will also allow 4th year undergraduates to enjoy exemptions from eight subjects out of the fourteen subjects in the ACCA qualification.
The MoU will also entail the two organizations working together to develop the accounting profession and accounting degree programmes in Sri Lanka, as well as promote the standards and ethics of the profession.
These goals will be achieved through conducting joint workshops, seminars, research, discussion events and conferences to build better knowledge and understanding of what is expected by finance professionals in the future.
The Vice Chancellor of University of Colombo Senior Professor Lakshman Dissanayake said that he strongly believed that this was an excellent opportunity for students of the University to enhance their academic degree with a globally recognized professional accountancy qualification such as that of ACCA, which is highly recognized by employers across the world.
ACCA Sri Lanka Head Nilusha Ranasinghe said, We are extremely pleased to extend our relationship with the University of Colombo, not only to offer even better options and opportunities for students but also to work towards producing professional accountants that the future industries in Sri Lanka so badly needs. We are confident that graduates from the University of Colombo by attaining our qualification, will have better acceptability in both local and international job markets which have become increasingly competitive.
This event was also attended by the Dean, Faculty of Management and Finance, University of Colombo, Dr. R. Senathiraja, heads of departments of the faculty and academic staff members of the department of accounting.

Anti-dumping law cleared for Parliament
Sri Lankan industries have been assured that the FTAs being mooted will not affect them nor will result in an imports dump that the domestic manufacturers are fearful of.
In fact, the much sought after anti-dumping legislation has been cleared by the Attorney General and is ready to head to the legislature.
We are planning to present the draft anti-dumping bill to the Parliament, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on September 27 in Colombo. Minister Bathiudeen was addressing the 26th AGM of Industry Association of Sri Lanka (IASL) at Cinnamon Grand.
Joining the event were Chairman of IASL Dinesh Dharmadasa, Assistant Secretary General of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce Rohan Casiechetty, Vice Chairman IASL Bandula Egodage and the Immediate Past Chairman IASL Nilam Jayasinghe. Industries operate in challenging environments, but with the help of government agencies including the Ministry of Trade, some of these have been overcome, said Chairman IASL Dharmadasa and added: FTAs to be signed by Sri Lanka could bring forth numerous new challenges. We thank the government for starting a dialogue with the industries and hope these dialogues will continue to facilitate viable operations of Sri Lankan industries once the FTAs are signed and open up new opportunities for our members.
"We like to mention that any further liberation of trade must be done after few basic safeguards like anti-dumping legislation and lowering of duties of raw materials for local manufacture of finished products.
In response, Minister Bathiudeen said: Our industries appear to be worried about impacts of FTAs and dumping. The unity government will not enter into such agreements without consulting local industries and without protecting them first. I am also pleased to say that we are looking at new steps on anti-dumping and my officials are studying issues on this.
"The Department of Commerce is a key institution working in this regard. In fact we are planning to present the draft Anti-Dumping Bill to the Parliament in the coming two-three weeks.
The policy of the unity government of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is to support development of industries. Last year, Minister Bathiudeen, joining the Minister of Development Strategies and International Trade Malik Samarawickrama proposed the anti-dumping legislation to the Cabinet and received the go-ahead to proceed. Having been cleared by the AG, the bill is now being translated to be presented to Parliament. The key focus of this anti-dumping bill is to counter unfair trade practices.

Arjun Mahendran cross-examined by Treasury Bond Commission
The former Central Bank Governor, Arjuna Mahendran yesterday revealed that the decision to stop issuing Treasury bonds through private placements came in a backdrop where the newly elected government has to pay Rs. 1.4 trillion unpaid bills of 2014.
He also explained that there was an urgent requirement of Rs. 15 billion to pay arrears due for already completed road development projects. Mahendran pointed out to the Treasury Bond Commission that Private Placement method was not raising enough funds but the fund requirements were urgent and crucial.
According to Mahendran, the Secretary to the Treasury was facing the crunch on massive payments including the unpaid bills of the year 2014 which were amounting to a large sum of Rs. 1.4 trillion. So we had to reach the International Monetary Fund to request emergency funding.
The Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera, who was cross-examining the witness, then asked how Mahendran dealt with the matter.
I spoke with the Secretary to the Treasury both in person and over the phone very extensively. The Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe personally spoke with the IMF head and discussed the matter of urgent fund requirement as well. I met the Secretary to the Treasury after every Cabinet sub-committee meeting. We discussed about this matter with the PM, FM and several other ministers as well throughout January, February 2015 and further. Mahendran said.
Then the secretary to the Treasury went to the IMF and did an elaborated presentation regarding the matter to the IMF. This was such a serious issue for both public and private sector. Even the IMF wrote a report on this matter, elaborating the magnitude. Mahendran explained. According to Mahendran, the presentation to the IMF was done on 10 February 2015 in New York.
De Livera then asked Mahendran as to who instructed him to do away with the direct placement method. Mahendran told the Treasury Bond Commission that it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who gave the directive to stop direct placement method. The Commissioner, Supreme Court Judge P.S. Jayawardena requested Mahendran to elaborate his answer in keeping with the answer given by him on a previous occasion to the same question.
Mahendran then explained that, following the first Cabinet meeting held on late January 2015, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told him to conduct all Central Bank procurement and other activities in a transparent manner. I interpreted it as stopping the direct placement method. Mahendran said.
Further explaining, Mahendran said, on 24 February 2017 at the Economic Sub Committee meeting, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe told him that the issuance of Treasury bonds should only be done by public auction.
Justice Jayawardena asked Mahendran if he had discussions with PM Wickremesinghe with regards to fund raising methods. Mahendran, in answering to Justice Jayawardena said, that he explained to PM Wickremesinghe that private placement does not raise enough funds and that there are other matters concerning the private placement method. Mahendran also told that he explained to PM Wickremesinghe that the manual of the Public Debt Department clearly states that fund raising should be done via public auction as much as possible. Thus, any instruction given by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe may have been based on the information you gave, Justice Jayawardena questioned, to which Mahendran answered in affirmative.
Mahendran denied ASG de Liveras suggestion that the Monetary Board disagreed with the decision to do away with the direct placement method. Mahendran pointed out, the Public Debt Department requested at a later stage, somewhere in late June 2015, to re-introduce a private placement dominant method, which was not accepted by the Monetary Board. If the MB disagreed with the initial decision to stop direct placement method, the MB could have accepted the PDDs proposal, Mahendran said.
De Livera also questioned Mahendran on Cabinet Sub-committee meetings and Economic Sub-committee meetings he participated. De Livera suggested that there were no decisions taken regarding urgent fund requirements for road development projects at these meetings.
Marking the minutes of 24 February 2015 Economic Sub-committee meeting, De Livera pointed out to the Commission that the decision taken at the said meeting was to finance all the road development projects with available funds.
According to Mahendran, the said meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, then Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake, Ministers Kabir Hasheem, Rauff Hakeem, Swaminadan, Dr. Harsha de Silva, Secretary to the Finance Ministry Dr. Samaratunga and senior officers of many ministries.
Mahendran denied that the available funds were enough to pay the arrears payments of Rs. 15 billion and observed that the minutes of the said meeting to be sketchy. De Livera asked if Mahendran is disputing the minutes of the meeting, to which Mahendran said that he is. My recollection is that there was a serious issue of funding requirement. he added.
Meanwhile the Chairman of the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury Bond Issue, Supreme Court Judge K.T. Chitrasiri yesterday informed that the proceedings of the Commission need to be over by the end of next week, so that it will have sufficient time to write the Commissions report.
Commissioner Justice P.S. Jayawardena on the same subject observed that there would be no point in conducting extensive investigations and receiving series of evidence from relevant parties, if they have a limited time to write a comprehensive report on the inquiry.
The Treasury Bond Commission commenced its probe on 21 February 2015. The Commission has heard evidence from about 50 witnesses from its commencement. These witnesses include around 20 witnesses from the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. The other witnesses include officials of the Employees Provident Fund, the Chief Dealer/Treasury Manager of Pan Asia Banking Corporation, the Chief Dealer/Treasury Manager of Bank of Ceylon, witnesses from companies which functioned as primary Dealers, officials from the Treasury and three officers of the Perpetual treasuries Limited.
Chairman Justice Chitrasiri requested the Attorney Generals panel to complete the cross-examination of Central Bank former Governor Arjun Mahendran in the earliest possible time.
Acting Solicitor General Dappula de Livera informed the tribunal that he can complete his cross-examination within the next day, and Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake and Senior State Council Shaheeda Barrie are to cross-examine Mahendran next.
The cross examination will continue today as well.

Atlantic City..!
Many years ago while visiting New York, it was my mother who suggested I visit Atlantic City. What dyou have over there I asked. Gambling! she said. I dont gamble, I told her. Just go and have a look at all the casinos and plazas, she said, youll be spell bound!
I was. Atlantic City is a few hours drive from New York. Buses take you there, and for the cost of the ticket, they even gave me twenty dollars worth of coupons. I put all the twenty dollars into one slot machine and lost everything at one go. I was happy with the result and decided to walk outside.
What a sight. There was Trumps Plaza and the Taj Casino and glass plated buildings where scantily clad beauties went around carrying coins for the machines. Everything spelt money.
I left the buildings and walked along the boardwalk watching the sea. Along the sea front where little tents selling small knickknacks. I walked across and saw something that looked out of place in Atlantic City. It was the poem Footprints, which was being sold for a dollar. I picked it up and as I read it there in the middle of all the vice, I wondered what it was doing here in Sin City, till I looked around and saw lonely broken people strolling on the beach, dozens who had lost hundreds and thousands of dollars in the gambling dens and wandered broken. Now I knew why the poem was selling here. Even to these people there was hope in this simple poem:
Footprints
One night a man had a dream.
He dreamed he was walking along the beach with the Lord.
Across the sky flashed scenes from his life.
For each scene, he noticed two sets of footprints in the sand; one belonging to him, and theother to the Lord.
When the last scene of his life flashed before him, he looked back at the footprints in the sand.
He noticed that many times along the path of his life there was only one set of footprints.
He also noticed that it happened at the very lowest and saddest times in his life.
This really bothered him and he questioned the Lord about it.
Lord, you said that once I decided to follow you, youd walk with me all the way.
But I have noticed that during the most troublesome times in my life there is only one set of footprints.
I dont understand why when I needed you most you would leave me.
The Lord replied, My precious, precious child, I love you and I would never leave you.
During your times of trial and suffering, when you see only one set of footprints in theSand it was then that I carried you!
Atlantic City: breaking people, and a God, waiting in a poem, to carry the broken ones. What a picture..!

Attack on Rohingya shelter : Ven. Akmeemana, another remanded
Ven. Akmeemana Dayarathna Thera and Ravindra Warnajith Perera who were summoned to the Colombo Crime Division (CCD) yesterday morning in connection to the attack on the Rohingya safe house in Mt Lavinia last week, have been remanded. The two suspects who surrendered to the CCD around 9 am yesterday, were questioned for over five hours prior to their arrests.
The Police media unit in a statement released to the media stated that Perera was a 40-year-old resident of Gangodawila, Nugegoda and the two were produced before the Mt Lavinia Magistrates Court later that day and subsequently remanded till October 9.
With the newly arrested duo yesterday, police have arrested eight suspects in connection with the attack on the Rohingya. The six arrested earlier have been remanded until October 9.
The 31 Rohingya refugees, mostly women and children who were evacuated from the safe house in Mt Lavinia were moved to the Boosa Detention Camp in Galle last week for greater protection. Certain extremist groups however had declared that they would hold a protest outside the camp over the refugees being given shelter there. The police which sprung into action after much criticism over their actions during the Mt Lavinia attack have been successful in obtaining a court order against any protest before the camp and had deployed close to 600 km policemen to guard a perimeter of 2 km around the camp.

Emerging top banana in monkey conflict drama!
Some people think that monkeys are cute and mischievous and great entertainers. Ok, I agree their antics are enjoyable and make great subjects for social media snap shots, assuming they havent stolen your camera by then. Certainly in this neck of the woods you are likely to encounter them in the wilds and even in suburbia.
It appears that theres no escaping their anthropomorphic presence anywhere in our tropical island nation. I once tried spending a quiet Christmas at a fancy eco resort in Dambulla. Fat chance! I may have been mercifully spared the commercial big city Jingle Bell jingles only to be replaced by the Jungle Bells jangles by large troupes of monkeys discoing on the aluminium roof top.
A good many people go ape about apes, far more than they do about fellow humans. Personally, I really dont like monkeys. In fact, I kind of detest them particularly those ruddy-faced pestiferous varmints of the Toque Macaque species, which the locals call the Rilawa. Those cute little monkeys that hang out in tourist areas might be fun to watch, but they can be dangerous.
These little scoundrels are the gangsters of the animal world.
Theyre like those out-of-control, hyperactive children who never got any discipline growing up and so feel like they can go around pestering, stealing and harassing people with impunity. The average local macaque is about two feet high and weighs probably around 15 pounds - but just because they are small it doesnt mean they cant harm you.
In fact, macaques can be very aggressive. Injuries that require hospital care are reported yearly, and authorities have even put up signs in tourist areas warning people to beware, but incidents continue to occur. These darn macaques give new meaning to monkey-shine and mischief in general. Most of their time their aggressive poses and teeth-revealing expressions are bluffs meant to intimidate. Male monkeys seem to enjoy harassing women and children more than adult men apparently as a way of showing off. Sometimes they bite and sometimes they carry nasty diseases.
Regardless of how tame and accustomed to people wild monkeys may seem, they should still be approached with caution. These creatures can be devilishly devious, in ways that are not immediately apparent to the untrained eye.
Monkeys are incredibly smart and wisely hang around snack areas in tourist spots. Be vigilant around food and drink carts and open-air restaurants that are situated close to the jungle cover. The grandkids and I had a traumatic encounter with an entire colony of marauding monkeys at an exclusively swank boutique eco-resort in Anuradhapura last week.
We made the mistake of opting for an alfresco breakfast a few feet outside the luxury cabana situated in the midst of the jungle canopy. The amenable resort staff left in their eco-friendly golf-buggies after laying out a delicious spread on a small table. Everything seemed serene as the three kids and I sat down to enjoy our first repast of the day. That was until we started to take the wrapping off our plates.
Suddenly we were surrounded by a ferocious horde of hirsute apes hanging off the nearby trees. The kids were terrified as they left the table duly prepared to abandon their appealing breakfast. Even though I had to think of an action plan I began to wonder about their sudden appearance at our impromptu dining site. There was certainly no evidence of their presence when the staff were setting the table. There was no time for frivolity but I quipped that they must have got their gossip on the Ape Vine.
I had to square up to a whole troupe of the little buggers to get the grandkids and our breakfast to the safety of our cabana. The terrified kids were out of their seats before you could say: Brass monkey or Monkey with brass. The ecologist advice in a situation like this is: Avoid smiling at them: For monkeys, showing teeth is a sign of threat and aggression. A misinterpreted smile or yell may provoke an unnecessary attack. And when a monkey smiles at you, back off immediately.
Okay so I didnt smile at the advancing ruddy army. No one in such circumstances would. This seemed like full-scale war with no quarter given. The first thing I did in the face-off was roar while ignoring little Moyas warning of: Dada, dont yell. They attack when yelled at! So I unleashed what I imagined was my stentorian, full-throated Tarzan-like challenging bellow that must have echoed through those silent green mansions for miles around.
You see, when it comes to a crisis it is sometimes prudent to throw conventional wisdom to the winds of chance. I was determined I should stay and defend our property and my little charges. Frankly I did not know how to defend property and my kids against a macaque attack. Such a skill was never covered in my fleeting two months of judo training, 25 years ago.
Sure, the macaques were smaller than I was, but they possessed a fearlessness certain human antagonists I have faced could only dream of. Yet, I was aware that if one bit or scratched me, Id be in the hospital getting rabies shots  an activity possibly less pleasant than the macaque bite.
The ape-man war-cry stopped that bunch of red-faced rapscallions in their tracks, but only for a time. About a half dozen of the shameless scallywags came forward like relentless commando fighters ready to pounce. I handed over the plates on the table to the oldest grandkid, Keshini to take inside the cabin, while reaching for my ever-present switchblade.
The evacuation operation took only a few minutes while the kids relayed the food and drinks into the safety of the cabin. I stood in a heroic Publius Horatius stance against the invading army of Lars Porsena at the bridge gate of Rome. The only thing left on the table was a heavy metal dining knife which I grabbed with my right hand while flicking my pocket switchblade open with my left hand.
There were screams from the advancing imps as the blade flashed open. There was a warning shout from the partially open doorway as the youngest of the grandkids Kingsley yelled: Dada watch out behind you!
I instinctively kicked backward as I observed another gang of ruddy rascals sneaking up on me. I realised that getting into a fight with an army of apes was not a wise or practical strategy. That is because the sneaky simians are quite adept at waging gorillawarfare. Leading the rearguard troop was a large alpha male with his vampire-like fangs flashing expressive eyebrows telegraphing rage.
I threw the heavy table knife at him which hit him square on the chest and he backed down while I reached the safety of the cabana. The indoor breakfast was an amusingly serene one as the children recounted the monkeyshines conflict. Little Kingsley between mouthfuls cracked: Thank Heavens our DaDa showed those silly monkeys that hes the top banana!

Basil seeks order transferring almanac case away from High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga

Filing a Transfer Application in the Court of Appeal, Former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa sought an order staying any further proceedings into controversial almanac case before Colombo High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga, currently presiding over Court No.6 of Colombo High Court.
He further sought an order transferring case from Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga to any other court of High Court of Colombo.
High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment regarding Controversial Sil Redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sill) distribution case. Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three-year-rigorous imprisonment by Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to TRC.
In his petition, Basil Rajapaksa stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against him. He further stated that one of the primary grounds on which the proceedings before PRECIFAC are sought to be challenged by him before the Court of Appeal complaining that he was denied a fair hearing at the purported inquiry by the PRECIFAC.
On June 15, the High Court case against two accused including former Economic Development Minister Basil Rajapaksa for allegedly misappropriating Rs.29.4 million of funds belonging to Divi Neguma Department was fixed for trial on November 13 by Colombo High Court judge Gihan Kulatunga.
When the Transfer Application was taken up before Court of Appeal (President) Justice L.T.B. Dehideniya and Justice Shiran Gunaratne, the Attorney General was noticed to appear in Court on October 26.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against former Minister and former director General of Divi Neguma Department Kithsiri Ranawaka in the Colombo High Court for allegedly printing 5 million almanacs with the image of former president Mahinda Rajapaksa, costing Rs.29.4 million, to be used as election propaganda material during January-2015 presidential election.
Presidents Counsel Gamini Marapana with counsel Navin Marapana, Kaushalya Molligoda instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Basil Rajapaksa.

Basil's bombshell
Former Minister Basil Rajapaksa is certainly not going to be a favourite of messrs. Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila or Ven. Elle Gunawansa. Not by a long way. Come to that, he is not going to endear himself to elder siblings Mahinda or Gota either. Not after his comments made in Jaffna, where he was busy setting up local branches of the pohottuwa party, over the weekend.
Addressing journalists, at the Jaffna Press Club, the younger Rajapaksa conceded that the security forces, indeed, committed crimes during and after the war. I think our forces did not do war crimes. But individuals must have done (crimes). We can call (it) crimes, Rajapaksa was quoted as saying. This is the first time that a Rajapaksa has admitted to crimes committed by the military, both during and after the war. He certainly would not have meant combatants, read the LTTE. For, essentially, killing guerillas, can, by no stretch of the imagination be described as a crime, in what was, after all, a war. Hence, if crimes were committed, as contended by Basil, it has got be against civilians. By this admission, the onetime powerful minister has certainly opened a can of worms. He has, wittingly or unwittingly, compromised all those who vehemently protested against the Darusman report, that listed specific instances of the killing of civilians, including the cold blooded murder of four schoolboys, in Trincomalee, alleged to have been committed by the security forces.
What is more, Basil has also endorsed the claim made by many, that, members of the security forces were responsible for abductions, particularly the allegation made by Sarath Fonseka that a Safe House operated in Colombo, staffed by members if the forces, who were responsible for the abduction and harming of journalists. He has given the lie to all the lamentations of his JO buddies and Bikkhu fronts who are weeping buckets for the war heroes who, it is said, were being maltreated by the Yahapalanaya government.
Basil has unmasked the true face of these war heroes and the Weerawansas, Gammanpilas and Elle Gunawansas can no longer blame the government for the maha paava deema. The charges made against the former Navy Spokesman now languishing behind bars, for being behind the abduction of Tamil youth from several areas in Colombo cannot be far-fetched, anymore. Those who were gnashing their teeth and tearing their hair over the ranaviru dadayama had better wake up and come to terms with reality. The man, who was once their Godfather, had let the cat out of the bag.
Basil's is not just an isolated admission. Major General (rtd.) Kamal Gunaratne had borne personal witness to crimes committed by the security forces, as contained in his book Road to Nandikadal. Basil cannot be faulted in that sense. Also, the brouhaha made over claims by Sarath Fonseka, vis-a-vis his successor as Army Commander, Lt.Gen. Jagath Jayasuriya, too is just so much hot air.
Rajapaksa's contention that all occupied land in the north should be returned to their original owners, too, has removed a strong plank in the JO's campaign to show up the government as paving the way for the re-emergence of the LTTE. By this stand Basil has even pooh-poohed the present Army Commander's position that withdrawing the army from the north, at this stage, was not feasible. In this too, Rajapaksa has gone against the campaign of the JO and Bikkhu organisations who are agitating for the retention of the military, at its full strength, in the north.
It was only the other day that his own brother, the former President, expressed fears that the LTTE, whom he defeated, was poised to make a comeback due to the government's move to reduce the strength of the military, in the north. How he will respond to Basil's remarks will be anyone's guess.
Of course, the younger Rajapaksa is on a political mission in the north, to obtain a foothold for the pohottuwa party, a tall order, though, this may be. One way of atoning for the militarist approach of the Rajapaksas, Basil would have thought, was doing a Mea Culpa, admitting to the crimes committed by the military. Whether this would have any impact is difficult to say. That is because the Rajapaksas have already blotted their copybook with the minorities, the Tamils in particular.
MR too was on a similar mission in the north, trying to woo the Tamils by distributing jewellery, stolen by the LTTE, prior to the Presidential Election. But this attempt came a cropper, judging the poll results in the north. Rajapaksa also must have estranged the northerners, further, by declaring that he was defeated on January 8 by the Tiger vote, thus branding all the Tamils as terrorists. Post war-victory, he also conducted himself in a manner that cast the Tamils as a conquered race, by staging military parades, and, also, banning the singing of the National Anthem in Tamil, in all the schools and at public functions in the north.
It is difficult to comprehend Basil pulling it off, where brother Mahinda failed.

Ethereal interest
Having gone to Art school in Oxford University very late at the age of 48, Elizabeth Porter did her MA at the Royal College of Arts also in London. Her degree was in Fine Arts. Elizabeth Porter has an interest in how animals relate with human beings. The animal and the man made. Most of her paintings are about animals. Daily News spoke to artist Elizabeth Porter who says she is interested in things that are slightly overlooked by people.
I perform as well as paint. I also do drawings and sculpture. I am interested in things that are quite small and in some ways not ordinary. But things that are ethereal. I have been painting since I was five years old. I have also done many exhibitions that are all slightly different to each other. Even though I am based in London, I have done exhibitions in Beijing, Germany and South of France. But mostly in London, said Porter.
Porter admits she paints in a very traditional manner. I even look back into the medieval. Like Fra Angelico. Even Medieval artists interest her. One feature in her paintings are that they are very portable, as in you can pick it up and put it in your bag. Even before Porter went to University she had a training in Chinese style of painting and lacquer. Her work is also from across the world. There is a small art school in Oxford University called the Ruskin. Oxford takes in 3000 students every year but there are only 30 arts students. They are all over the University. Nearly everyone in the group that Porter was in were in the age range of 19s. She was the only student in her 40s. Porter admits that in some way she felt lonely. However porter points out that they were so kind to her and she learnt so much from them.
Particularly in a city, we try to exclude animals. And we are not entirely successful. We try to police animals in the way we do ourselves. If you take small animals, they dont see the world as we see it. They do not see the glass and the concrete. In London we have pigeons everywhere. They dont see the city. They see it as cliffs where they breed. What would a bird make of a gun It would see a branch or a tree. I really dont know but I am interested in putting the animal and the man- made together. Put it besides each other. I want to ask the viewer questions, explained Porter.
Her message for someone who wants to take up art is simply to do it. Dont think about it. Just do it. One of her favorites ever, is a tiny painting in the National Gallery of London. The front has angels depicted and Richard the III that makes it 15th century. But the bit that I like is the animal on the back. It is not important. It is just a deer on the back. I am interested in the things that you might not notice. Things that are just behind. Even in the Barefoot Caf there are so many varieties of birds and even squirrels, and people dont notice them, said Porter.
Art school was so much fun for her! Interestingly enough Porter calls herself very quiet and very shy during her formative years. She recalls that she once went to an interview and she simply could not speak! A lot of us can relate to Elizabeth Porter. Sometimes we are so shy that we are simply unable to speak! Painting is now Porters bread and butter. She paints to earn a living and she loves to work.
To go to arts school and be with other artists for three years in Oxford, that is an amazing experience. I have always had a very rich fantasy life. One reason I went into fantasy maybe because of my introverted nature. I lived in a very tiny village in the middle of a country side. I had a lot of time on my own with dogs and cats. I was in the farmland In the middle of nowhere. There was an airport nearby and I would walk around the woods. And I remember that planes would fly over my head! And I felt that I could touch them. The books I liked as a child were the Narnia Chronicles. I am quite a leader. I loved that, said Porter.
A sensitive woman she feels so powerless when she hears about war. So there is a small reference to it in her mind.
In a city small animals are everywhere and is see a certain beauty in their circumstances. Things that really people have discarded. Some of my paintings are pretty random, said Porter.
Porter calls herself mostly spiritual and that she was brought up as Catholic even though she does not belong to any denomination. And she says that there is always something that can break inside of us and needs care and needs love. Like a small animal might. I am interested in being creative generally. I am not in one particular way of expression.
I am interested in my own dreams and what happens in them. They are full of animals. I am more interested in things that are more animal and less human. I dont know but my dreams are like that, said Porter.

European Investment Bank to finance Megapolis projects
European Investment Bank (EIB) is looking at entering into financing agreement for several major infrastructure development projects under the Ministry of Megapolis and Western Region Development.
This was subsequent to a business luncheon with senior officials at the banks headquarters in Luxembourg with Foreign Minister Tilak Marapana when he paid an official visit to Luxembourg. This was the first visit of a Sri Lankan Foreign Minister to Luxembourg since the establishment of diplomatic relations between the two countries in 1972.
Foreign Minister Marapana had a breakfast meeting with Minister of Foreign Affairs of Luxembourg Jean Asselborn at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Luxembourg city and it was noted that Luxembourg is among the top 15 Foreign Direct Investors in Sri Lanka and there is tremendous potential for further investment.
Luxembourg as one of the worlds top financial centres has interest in capital investments and there are several of the worlds leading multinational companies that have their headquarters based in Luxembourg. The two Ministers agreed to further strengthen bilateral relations with particular focus on economic opportunities. They undertook to facilitate the upcoming visit of a business delegation from Sri Lanka to Luxembourg in this regard.

Brief history of Parliamentary democracy in Sri Lanka
There will be a special session in Parliament today, to mark the 70th anniversary of Parliamentary democracy flourishing in Sri Lanka.
Parliament established prior to independence under the Soulbury Constitution, was the legislative body of British Ceylon and Dominion of Ceylon, replacing the State Council.
The First Parliament, the House of Representatives of then Ceylon, ceremonially met at the inaugural session on October 14, 1947 at the Independence Square with Prince Henry, the Duke of Gloucester with the First Prime Minister, D.S. Senanayake. It was the formal ceremony to mark the beginning of Self-Rule.
According to Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Speakers from the South Asian Association for Regional Cooperation would be present to mark the occasion. Senior politicians would also be present on the occasion.
Making reference to the achievements the country had made, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had observed that Sri Lanka has upheld Parliamentary democracy without interruption for seven decades despite the fact the country had faced two failed military coup attempts in 1960, and 1971 coupled with insurrection / youth unrest and then the 1989 revolt.
The country also suffered internal strife for almost three decades within this period, but still Parliamentary democracy prevails, earning admiration from the world, including the Inter Parliamentary Union (IPU). Today, it stands as a role-model for the rest of the world.
Prior to the creation of Parliament or the House of Representative, Sri Lanka, then Ceylon experienced the establishing of the first Legislature; the Executive Council and the Legislative Council on March 13, 1833, based on the recommendation of the Colebrook-Cameron Commission.
The Governor of Ceylon presided over the Executive Council Meetings which was composed of the Colonial Secretary, Officer Commanding the Military Forces, the Attorney General, the Auditor General and the Treasurer. Though it was first composed only of British Officials, with the passage of time, natives were elected to the Legislative Council, and the local representative rose from 16 Members at the beginning to 49 Members.T he right to cast vote at an Election, was reserved to those qualified. That Legislative Council was dissolved in 1931 and the Ceylon State Council with more powers replaced it, with 101 members elected by the public enjoying the universal adult franchise, provided by the Donoughmore Constitution.
The election for the first Parliament was held from August 23 to September 20,1947 to determine the membership of the first Parliament. That Parliament was dissolved on April 8, 1952. The term of that Parliament was four years, five month and 24 days. The elections were held on 23,25,26, 27, 28, 30 August and 1, 4,.6,8,9,10,11,13, 15, 16, 17,18 and September 20,1947.
Sri Lanka, then Ceylon, won independence on February 4, 1948. But before that, based on the Soulbury Commission recommendations, steps were taken to dissolve the State Council and establish a bicameral Parliament in 1947: the Westminster model with an upper house and a lower house.
The lower house referred to as the House of Representatives, (Parliament) had 95 members elected directly by the people at the election and six nominated members to compose 101 Members of the House of Representatives. (This number was increased to 157 in 1960). The Upper House or the Senate as we all know had 30 members. Out of this, 15 were elected by the House of the Representatives, and the other 15 were nominated by the Governor General.
Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Leader Sirimavo Bandaranaike feared to contest the 1960 March and July General Elections. But the results of the 1960, July General Election was a big victory for the SLFP, and it was the Senate that paved the way for Mrs Bandaranaike, as the SLFP leader to enter Parliament and form the government and run the affairs of the country as Prime Minister operating from the Senate. ( (She is claimed to be the first Woman Prime Minister in the World).
She scrapped, that very Senate on October 2, 1972, she herself was a member from 1960 July until she contested the Attanagalla seat in the 1965 General Election.
With the promulgation of the very first indigenous Constitution on May 22, 1972 known as Republican Constitution, the National State Assembly with 168 elected Members, replaced the House of Representatives. The 1978 Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka, promulgated under the UNP Government led by the First Executive President, J.R. Jayawardene, replaced that National State Assembly with Parliament of Sri Lanka with the enactment of the Constitution now in force from 1977.
The first Prime Minister, D.S. Senanayake, who is also referred to as the Father of the Nation, died suddenly on March 22, 1952. His untimely death, gave room to friction within the rank and file of the UNP and Dudley Shelton Senanayake appointed by the Governor General Soulbury, and it is claimed that appointment was a positive response to a request made by Premier D.S. from the Governor.
But though accepted Premiership, Dudley was keen to test the will of the people and the Government was thus dissolved. He and his Party UNP was elected at the General Election. He resigned from the post of Prime Minister and was succeeded by Sir John Kotalawala. Then on the results of the 1956 April Election, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike became the Prime Minister.
The promulgation of the 1978 Constitution gave a new lease of life to the Parliamentary system of Government and the number of Members to Parliament increased to 225, and the Members were elected on the preference vote. Today, Parliament of Sri Lanka consists of 225 members. While 196 Members are directly elected by the people at an election, 29 are elected from the National Lists allocated to the political parties and the independent groups based on the share each party receives at the election. They are elected for a five-year term on the proportional representation empowering them to make all laws of the land.

Call to serve
The recent decision given by the Colombo High Court regarding the criminal misappropriation of funds by the former Presidential Secretary Lalith Weeratunga and the other has revived an old debate over the relationship between the senior public servant and the politician.
The High Court action should shake the entire bureaucracy, especially the senior officers of the Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS), out of their complacency. It should make them introspect on how they should regulate their responses to ministerial demands for unequivocal compliance of directions.
The relationship between senior public servants and their political masters is one of the central issues in our contemporary governance. To a certain extent, the neat distinctions of the original public administration thinkers - politicians make policy, public servants implement policy has become more theoretical than real.
In political sense, both groups of actors can claim a legitimate role in policymaking. However, in democratic terms, the claims of the political leaders may carry greater weightage. They have a popular mandate through elections and therefore can claim to represent the will of the people.
The main claim from the senior public servants for involvement in making policy is the expertise of the bureaucracy. They believe most politicians are amateurs in the policy areas and only the experienced public servant can offer direction and advice to make the best possible political decision.
Delicate balance
All politicians, by their inbuilt nature, are eager to pursue their political ambitions. They want to be in the limelight not only in Parliament but with media and across their constituents. In the process, most of them would like to have the allegiance of the senior public servants to make their political ambitions realised.
By convention, however, government servants are excluded from helping politicians directly to fulfil their political ambitions. Particularly, a public servants role is such that he must maintain a neutrality in political matters, in order to ensure confidence in the political impartiality of the Administration Service.
The challenge in this broader perspective is how to create a willingness between politicians and senior public servants to embrace the virtues of consultation and consensus. In principle, the senior public servants should never be coerced by politicians, to fulfil their political dreams. In short, the public service must be free from all political affluence. The strength of this position is that it will enable politicians and senior public servants to address national problems jointly, and to know that public policy is grounded in the concrete experiences of the community.
Neutrality
At this point, it might be appropriate for us take a brief look at how the relationship between politician and public servant operates in the UK.
Public Administration Select Committee of House of Commons, Politics and Administration: Ministers and Civil Servants. Third Report of Session 200607  (Volume I) states:
The civil services relationship with government has long been recognised as more complex than simply being the enthusiastic instrument of government policies. As Dr Matthew Flinders of Sheffield University put it: In practice, it is quite clear that the bureaucracy has its own implicit values, wants and desires and these may on occasion conflict with the instructions of ministers.
Yet the only explicit acknowledgement of this potential for conflict within the current system is when civil servants act in the role of Accounting Officers. In that context, they have a clearly defined role as the guardians of propriety in public expenditure. If they believe a particular expenditure would be a misuse of public funds, they may formally note the fact. The minister may override their objections, but the note is sent to the Treasury and the Comptroller and Auditor General. Such a note will inevitably come to the attention of the Public Accounts Committee. It is quite clear that according to the British governments view, the civil servant is responsible to ministers, but, as the role of Accounting Officer, that responsibility is complex, and not limited simply to implementing government policies.
Carltona doctrine
In UK, The Carltona doctrine is the legal principle under which civil servants exercise power on behalf of ministers. It expresses the idea that the acts of government departmental officials are synonymous with the actions of the minister in charge.
The point was established in Carltona Ltd v. Commissioners of Works. The judgment states:
In the administration of government in this country the functions which are given to ministers (and constitutionally properly given to ministers because they are constitutionally responsible) are functions so multifarious that no minister could ever personally attend to them. The duties imposed upon ministers and the powers given to ministers are normally exercised under the authority of the ministers by responsible officials of the department. Public business could not be carried on if that were not the case.
Constitutionally, the decision of such an official is, of course, the decision of the minister. The minister is responsible. It is he who must answer before Parliament for anything these officials have done under his authority, and, if for an important matter he selected an official of such junior standing that he could not be expected competently to perform the work, the minister would have to answer for that in Parliament.
Sri Lankan context
Sri Lankas public service has experienced several changes in its chequered history during the post-independence era. With the independence in 1948, one of the political issues which cropped up was whether Sri Lanka should continue with the Civil Service. Accordingly, in 1959, Wilmot A. Perera Commission was appointed to study the existing system and make suitable recommendations. In their report, the Commission stressed the need for unification of the Government administrative grades.
What the Commission meant by the term unification was the absorption of the Ceylon Civil Service and all other officers performing administrative functions in various departments, who do not belong to the Ceylon Civil Service, into one common group of officers. In 1963, the government abolished the Ceylon Civil Service and a created a unified administrative service to be termed as Ceylon Administrative Service. In 1972, the name was changed to Sri Lanka Administrative Service (SLAS). Along with this change, Public Service Commission (PSC), the constitutionally mandated independent body was also abolished and the powers of recruitment, transfer and disciplinary control of public officers had been vested in the Cabinet.
In 1978, PSC was re-established but powers of appointment of secretaries was retained by the cabinet. Independent political analysts believe this provision paved the way for legitimization of political interferences at high levels of appointments. The present government has repeatedly said that steps will be taken to depoliticise the system.
Today, SLAS officers hold key positions in the Central Government, Provincial governments and Public-Sector Undertakings.
Reasons
Fifty four years after the establishment of SLAS, we have to ask ourselves two simple but practical questions. What was the impact of five decades of involvement by the SLAS bureaucrats in nation-building and socio-economic development Were the expected objectives of forming a unified Administrative Service achieved
Some fifty odd years ago, we had an enviable public administration system considered to be one of the best in Asia. Going by the severity of the public dissatisfaction during the past decades, it is obvious the quality of service has plummeted down.
Other than the political interferences, there are other reasons as well for this downfall.
(1) Most of our political leaders do not demonstrate high standards of propriety in the discharge of their official duties
(2) Most of our public officials (including seniors) act ignorant the fundamental values of the public service and standards of integrity and conduct to apply in their daily work
(3) We have not properly identified the risks to integrity in key government activities and have not developed countermeasures to manage these risks
(4) We have failed to place fool-proof solid mechanisms to enable civil society organisations, media and the wider public to scrutinise government Public servants actions.
There has been a growing debate over politicisation of public administrative service which is damaging the service. Apparently, the gap between politicians rhetoric, public expectations and the day-to-day dilemmas facing senior public servants wanting to improve the quality of the public services is increasing. Despite a Ministry of Public Management Reforms, the SLAS still essentially constitutes a system of public administration rather than of public management.
The need of the future is a cadre of dedicated SLAS officers based on a professionally oriented, technically competent, politically and ideologically neutral bureaucracy.

Exports to reach US$ 11.1 bn by year end
There is an increase in exports and if the same trend continues exports will reach US$ 11.1 billion by the end of this year, said President National Chamber of Exporters, Ramal Jasinghe speaking at their 25th awards ceremony at Colombo Hilton.
In a marathon speech of over half an hour which put a section of the audience to sleep, he said that assuming a growth rate of 10% over the next 3 years exports could reach US$ 15 billion by 2020 as opposed to the national target of US$ 20 billion by 2020, for which the achievement requires an annual growth rate of 20%.
However, exports as a percentage of GDP currently stands at 12.7 % having progressively declined from over 30% since the 2000.
Overall, our exports have been stagnant or have recorded an erratic and declining trend since 2010, reaching US$ 10.3 billion in 2016.
Nevertheless, the latest figures shows a welcome positive turnaround achieving USD 6,521.9 million (6.5 billion) compared to US$ 6,013.1 million (6 billion) for the comparative period in 2016, reflecting a growth rate of 8.4%.
Fisheries products too have achieved a growth rate of 38.6% and agricultural products including plantation crops have achieved a growth rate of 17.2% during the first 7 months of the year, however our main export sector of textiles and garments has continued to record a negative trend with a decline of 3% in spite of regaining of the GSP+ facility.
It is also pertinent to note that according to the Central Bank Annual Report for 2016, Industrial Production as a percentage of our GDP is just 26.8% and of that figure, only 35.2% of this total production is exported while the major portion of the industrial output is consumed domestically.
We are disappointed do note that the withdrawal under the new Inland Revenue Act the 300% deduction of expenditure incurred by any entity registered with the Tertiary and Vocational Education Commission (TVEC) for standard skills development training recognized by the TVEC, is counter- productive.
Jasinghe also highlighted the delay encountered (over three years) to register Trade Marks and also Intellectual Property Rights (IPRs) locally and overseas.
Nevertheless the initiative to set up a Single Window under the Trade Facilitation Program as well as the Revenue Administration and Information System (RAMIS) of the Customs for online transactions needs to be appreciated.
We feel that given the required Political Will, the best opportunity lies with the current Unity Government to put in place through consensus, firm National Policies to overcome these issues.
However it must be pointed out, that under the new Inland Revenue Act the tax incentive allowing 300% tax deduction of expenditure incurred for Brand Promotion has been withdrawn completely, which we feel is regressive and counter- productive, as this is a vital need for the export promotion of the country.
NCE President said the new taxation policy related to exports is not aligned to the National Export Strategy as demonstrated by the overall increase of Corporate Tax covering all export ventures from 12% to 14%, and more importantly applicability of the Corporate Tax of 14% to the hitherto exempt sectors related to Services Exports as well as to the Gems & Jewellery.
We feel that the very limited incentive for providers of professional services only by individuals and partnerships with an exemption of Corporate Taxes up to Rs. 15 million of turnover, provided the exported professional service is consumed outside the country and not in Sri Lanka, is not rational. Further the tax incentive of 300% of expenditure incurred on R&D activities through State Institutions has been reduced to 200% under the new tax reforms. In the background where the expenditure incurred on R&D is less than1% of GDP in the case of Sri Lanka, and the necessity for innovation and differentiation of products and services to diversify exports of our country for which it is essential to incur expenditure on R&D, this approach does not provide a conducive environment.
We hope that these concerns will receive the attention of the State authorities to make the necessary adjustments through the budget to be presented in November. Under the new Inland Revenue Act for the requirement for an enterprise to export at least 80% of the production to be eligible for the concessionary corporate taxation of 14%, applicable to export ventures, and that too only for the exported component.

Chandimals dogged ton puts his detractors in the shade
Dinesh Chandimal, after a few hiccups came good at last. Sri Lanka were looking down the gun barrel with Kaushal Silva, Thirimanne and the wonder boy Kusal Mendis back in the hatch for a mere 61 runs. Thrimannes endless opportunities given to him seems to never end. He succumbed to the wiles of Yasir Shah quite meekly. Kaushal Silva coming back to the scene after a while, could not make use of the opportunity although he stuck around facing 58 balls, when Amir and Abbas were making the ball talk. Mendis is also going through a bad patch, one wonders whether his focus has gone haywire, a well earned rest would do him a world of good.
It looked as if another Lambs led to slaughter was in the offing and with the experience of the setbacks since of late, the depression surfaced again. The Sri Lankans were gutted by now and Dimuth Karunaratne, always the unsung hero weathered the storm in his usual unruffled manner, and with Mendis back in the hutch, in strode Chandimal (a cloud hanging over him due to manipulations which were really uncalled for) to join Karunaratne.
During the early stages of their partnership Karunaratne was more at home with the proceedings with his prominant onside play, although he missed quite a few deliveries which nearly kissed the outside edge of the bat. Chandimal was locked in his shell for quite some time and he was determined not to swish outside the off stump, which has caused his undoing many a time, very few boundaries came along from his broad bat and gave the impression that he was going to keep his wicket at any cost , come what may.
This partnership meandered along, and they managed to put together 100 runs and Sri Lanka was well out of the woods by then. But Karunaratne was stuck at 93 due to tight field settings and accurate bowling. He tried to break the shackles drove the ball towards long on and drove too hard and came darting down the wicket and Chandimal (ball watching or not) would have committed suicide if he ran towards the other end. Lo and behold Karunaratne was left high and dry and was runout. The gentle Old Josephian showed no malice when he walked back to the pavilion showing his true pedigree, perhaps he was hard done by the run out. During this period of play, some of the TV commentators ours in particular were accusing Chandimal for the run out which was not quite fair.
Whilst Chandimal was holding the fort in came Dickwella, and straightaway he was on song, dancing laterally on the crease bamboozling the young Pakistani pace bowlers and cheekily picking the gaps at will going his merry way and he blasted 83 runs in no time. His innings was of great value to Sri Lanka because it put the Pakistani bowlers off balance. By now the Pakistani fielders were baking in the sun like hot cross buns. Dilruwan Perera joined Chandimal and by now the skippers crisp cover drives were evading the fielders whereas before it found them. Perera robust in build and courage to match was a good ally to the skipper.
Perera is no slouch with the bat because he got a 95 on his Test debut against Pakistan at UAE in January 2014. It is interesting to note that Perera in 2007 made his ODI debut as an opening batsman and was left in the back burner for 7 long years, so was Chamara Silva a brilliant fielder and an attacking bat who put Shane Warne to the sword at the Wanathamulla Oval and what made the people up above ignore this gifted cricketer is another mystery. They both played for Panadura Sports Club is another matter to contend with! Perera batted with guts survived the DRSs and played the lofted drives with power, he looked stolid which was the order of the day.
Chandimals 372 ball knock had 14s and his strike rate was 41.66, not only was his concentration admirable his stamina was tremendous and no running repairs were observed during his knock.
Fitness count in international cricket and under the baking conditions in UAE, it had to be the survival of the fittest, so Chandimal skippering the side fitted the bill perfectly. Still one wonders if he fails the next time will he be shown the door!

The owners being the Deraniyagala family lit the oil lamp amidst relatives, friends and potential clients. In the heart of Mount Lavinia, nestled in a sprawling garden fringed with coconut palms, and more importantly - a large parking area, is this elegant venue. Topped with a welcoming ambience, everyone seemed to find their own space to relax, have conversation, a dip into a chocolate fountain, a cheese platter, a variety of thirst quenches, pass around canaps, poolside chatter and lively music; all of which contributed to a pleasant and memorable evening.

Fitness plus brains!
Damith Chandima Bandara Wijayathunga who hails from Matale represented Sri Lanka in the first edition of the Manila-based male pageant; Man of the World 2017 held on July 18 in the Philippines.
The pageant was held at One Esplanade in Pasay City with the theme; Celebrating Masculinity with Responsibility. Prior to representing the Man of the World 2017 pageant Damith won the title of Mister Sri Lanka in 2016. Damith being a passionate individual shared his experiences about the pageant and more with the Daily News T&C.
Who inspired you to maintain physical fitness and good looks
More than an inspiration it was more of my own passion towards fitness. I firmly believe health is better than wealth.
I have another passion which is professional education.
I aspire to blend fitness with brains and to be a role-model to young Sri Lankan models.
Tell us about your background.
I hail from Matale and I am the eldest in a family of three.
After my education at St Thomas College, Matale, and Science College, Matale, I pursued higher education. I graduated from National School of Business Management in Computer Science.
I have been a sports enthusiast from schooling days and have played cricket and done athletics, specializing in 100-200 meters.
I also enjoy hiking, orienteering and rock climbing, watching movies and going to the gym.
You won the title of Mister Sri Lanka prior to representing Sri Lanka at the Man of the World 2017. Tell us about you the time you vied to become Mister Sri Lanka and representing Man of the World 2017.
I never thought I could achieve the title of Mister Sri Lanka. It all happened subsequent to a casting test.
This particular casting test opened new vistas in my life, paving way for a modeling career. Modeling was my window to venture into the Mister Sri Lanka contest in 2016 and to win the title.
I always had faith and courage in everything I did. I worked hard in every little thing I did and always tried my best. I continue to do so.
This was the first edition of Man of the World. How does this contest differ from Mister World and Mister International contests
All international contests have their own themes which are their core competencies.
Man of the World 2017 Pageant had its theme, Celebrating Masculinity with Responsibility.
The pageant also looks for men who are geared with the five attributes; Masterly, Mindful, Manly, Masculine and Modern.
The winner gets openings to work with different agencies in Indonesia, Malaysia and Singapore and he will have opportunities as an international model and to be in the entertainment sector.
Share your experiences at Man of the World 2017.
All the contestants were very friendly.
We visited many beautiful and cultural places in the Philippines. My favourite place was Negros Oriental Dumaguete, one of the most beautiful islands I have ever seen.
I made many friends there, but the ones who were closest to me were Mr Vietnam, Mr Gibraltar, Mr Cape Verde, Mr Algeria, Mr Nepal, Mr Zambia and Mr China.
Not having time to be in the gym and to have a good nights sleep was a drawback for all of us. Some contestants fell ill due to extensive travelling.
Though the pageant was very tiring it was a worthwhile experience I will always treasure.
My national costume was admired by everyone.
There were 29 Contestants and you were in the top 18 Semi- finalists.
How did you feel when that was announced
I liked that recognition. However I was not overjoyed by that fact. We all focused on maintaining our motivation levels and positive frame of mind until the end of the pageant.
Who helped and guided you to represent Sri Lanka
My family was the greatest strength behind my success. National Director Brian Kerkoven guided and encouraged me a lot.
Sameera Weerasinghe, Hiran Wijesekera, Kamil Hewavitharana helped me with my wardrobe and provided general guidance. I also thank Sanka media team and all the friends and fellow Sri Lankans who supported me in one way or another.
How do you think Sri Lankan youth should prepare themselves for international contests of this nature
There should be more encouragement from the organizers and authorities towards events of this nature. Another aspect is providing more effective training. We must adopt modern methods of training aiming at global pageants and benchmark with global standards.
Contestants must be familiar with the international standards. They must be shown what it takes to represent a country at these types of events.
What is in store for you for the future
I look forward to moving on with my modeling career and move up the career ladder with professional education. I want to add value to the modeling sphere with my skills.

Thoughts on a better world
Do you agree that we should adopt as our life's motto: Be kind to one another.
This includes avoiding resentment of any kind. Resentment is corrosive to the human psyche that we persuade the world media not to give inordinate prominence to misdeeds of jihadists. This prominence is what they hope the world media to project. This prominence given to misdeeds is akin to feeding the wild beasts.
Preserve our planet from ecological disaster by rewarding those countries which preserve their rain forests etc. Make the occupiers of buildings abutting our roads responsible for keeping the space in front of their properties spotlessly clean.
Daily papers should run a page for recording complaints received from the pubic in relation to lack of public service and repeat the complaints till they are satisfactorily dealt with. If no action is taken after a reasonable period the names of the sleeping officials concerned should be printed.
Books, especially those used in schools, should not portray dark people as villains while the fair Caucasians are shown as heroes. This could to some extent lessen ethnic bias for our Cricket team. Subject members to counselling before taking to the field which prevents them from trying to hit sixes and getting caught. We recall here immortal Don Bradman's two great innings (482-&388+) which did not contain a single six. Tail-enders to be taught to bat. At present their average contribution does not go beyond one figure.
Also our batsmen should appreciate the role of the bat which is, for the most part to hit the ball and not to kiss it and get caught to a silly position fielder or one in the slips.

Fleeing Sri Lankans with fake passports say they wanted to escape poverty
The four Sri Lankan nationals arrested in March for allegedly attempting to enter the UK with forged documents have said that they wanted to escape poverty, threats to Tamils and the hardships they faced during the civil war in their country, according to a charge sheet filed against them by the police.
On March 10, immigration officials at the Chhatrapati Shivaji International Airport caught Sri Lankan nationals Suthakaran Arunasalam (34), Karthatheepan Kannathsan (26), Gajan Chandrabalan (31) and Kaveenthini Kandasamy (23), as they prepared to board a British Airways flight to London. The police found forged boarding passes for the flight with a fake departure stamp and forged Indian passports bearing the names of British nationals in the possession of three of them. Kandasamy had reportedly flushed her Indian passport in a restroom before she was caught.
At the same time, the Bureau of Immigration caught British nationals Julie Ann Warner, Dominic Bower, Stuart Quilliam and Captain Fivehats, just as they were about to board an Air India flight to Ahmedabad. Investigations later revealed that three agents  two Sri Lankans and one Indian  made Indian passports in the name of the British nationals and arranged for them to be exchanged on the airport premises.
The arrested Sri Lankan nationals were also booked to fly to Ahmedabad but managed to bypass immigration checks after checking-in for the domestic flight. The police later arrested Sunil Soni, a salesman who allegedly helped the agents obtain an Indian SIM card using forged documents, as well as Sri Lankan agent Reyappan Thevakumaran.
The Sahar police station, which booked all 10 accused with human trafficking, cheating and forgery under the Indian Penal Code, has filed two charge sheets in the case so far.
In its supplementary charge sheet filed at Andheri magistrate court in August, the police have included statements that the Sri Lankan nationals gave to the Bureau of Immigration the day they were caught.
The 400-page document includes statements of staff at hotels that the accused stayed at, of immigration officials and those they had met during their stay in India.

GMOA calls off strike scheduled for October 6

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA)called off the strike which was scheduled to be held this Friday, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
He cited that the Health Ministry met its demand and cancelled the post intern appointment list which was not approved by the Transfer Board.
He said this while addressing a press conference at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo, today.
 GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said that at the moment the Health Ministry is in the process of re-making the list with the approval of the Transfer board and therefore the need for a strike may not arise on Friday. 
Earlier the GMOA warned to launch acountrywide persisting strike on next Friday (6th) if the Health Ministry failed to rectify the inaccurate post intern appointment list which was made without the Transfer Board approval, Dr. Aluthge said.
He said that the GMOA requested the Health Ministry Secretary to withdraw the existing list and to make a proper list after calling an immediate meeting of the Transfer Board.
The Secretary responded positively for the request, he said.
Meanwhile Health Ministry Secretary issued a statement stating that he had given two days for the GMOA to present written proposals.

The Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) will launch a countrywide strike on Friday (6) if the Health Ministry does not rectify the existing inaccurate post intern appointment list, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the GMOA requested the Health Ministry Secretary to withdraw the existing list and make a proper list after calling an immediate meeting of the Transfer Board.
The GMOA would make a formal request from the Public Service Commission to conduct a formal and proper investigation on the conduct of Dr. Priyantha Athapaththu and would make an appointment with the Commission to discuss the existing problematic situation, he said.
A lot of issues were there since 2016 with the post intern appointment list because it is made and declared by the Health Ministry without the consultation of the Transfer Board due to political interference.
In the past, there was no such issue because the list was finalised and declared with the consultation of all relevant parties, especially the Transfer Board. No political influences were in the past, he said.

Govt targets Rs. 2.2 trillion income in 2018: Minister Samaraweera
The government targets an income of Rs. 2.2 trillion in 2018, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
The Minister was addressing the national ceremony to mark World Habitat Day in Matara yesterday.
He said the value of loan installment to be paid for the financial year is around Rs. 1.7 trillion. Over 84 percent of such loans have been obtained by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa as then Finance Minister, he said.
The minister said the former government went for a snap election as they were aware that they would have to face the crisis soon.
The former government declared a snap Presidential Election not because of the predications made by an astrologer, but because of an imminent crisis in the economy due to the debt burden, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said certain individuals were of the view that the government was on the verge of collapse, when a Minister tendered his resignation to prove his innocence.
He said no person in the world other than a Buddhist who can implement the ideals of reconciliation.
From our childhood, we were trained to meditate wishing people of all communities wellness, happiness and kindness, he said.

Hard work, belief and trust brought us victory  Chandimal
ABU DHABI, Monday: Sri Lanka Test captain Dinesh Chandimal said that hard work, belief and trust his players had with each other brought them the dramatic 21-run win over Pakistan in the first Test at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium here yesterday.
The guys worked hard before the match and finally that hard work paid off, said Chandimal at the post match press conference.
As a team, we were below par in our performances, but we had waited for this win and finally we got it. Credit goes to all the players. They played some really good cricket, Im sure this can continue throughout the series, he said.
We did more work on our fitness and fielding, and discipline. Everyone put their heart and soul into the practices, and the management put lots of hard work in.
It is tough, especially with this heat. The management supported us, even during the game, going around giving the players drinks, and that made a difference. We didnt feel the heat as we were binding as a family. That is the difference we had in this game.
Chandimal also had a good word for the new selection committee headed by former Sri Lanka fast bowler Graeme Labrooy.
Thanks to the selectors as well. Before we came here, they talked to me and the team, and that gave us a lot of confidence. That made a difference, and the guys played some outstanding cricket in the middle.
Recalling the end of the fourth day when Sri Lanka were struggling at 69-4 Chandimal said, It was a tough time, especially last evening (Sunday). We were surprised to be four down for 65, but we thought before play started today (Monday) that 160-plus would be a winning total.
This time, we got a totally different wicket to the last two series. We all knew there was a bit of spin. (Niroshan) Dickwella was outstanding in the second innings to get us to the 140 mark. We all knew the legend Rangana (Herath) would come into play, and finally he did his best.
Rangana is a team man. He is supportive to me and the players, with what he has learnt from cricket. Every young player goes to talk to him about his bowling and experiences. He is a wily old fox. Hes a good asset to the team. I have no idea how long he is going to play, but I just want him throughout my career, said Chandimal.
Our Batsmen Didnt Attack Herath  Arthur
Pakistan coach Mickey Arthur blamed his batsmen for not being positive against Herath which allowed him to dominate their batting in the second innings.
We did a lot of homework, our players has played him a lot. But obviously on the last day he was always going to be a factor and youve got to give him more respect, said Arthur.
I would probably have liked to see our batsmen take him on. But early on I would have liked the batsmen to attack him. Once you take him on and that goes for any bowler, the game sort of settles down.
I am going back to Dickwella in the morning and for a period when Sarfraz and Haris were going on for a period of time and the key to that was to remain positive and not getting tentative and look for runs. If you allow Herath to settle down he will do what he did today, he said.
Chasing 136 you expect one good partnership to chase that down so thats particularly disappointing. It was challenging but we probably should have got there.

Herath sends Pakistan batting into a spin
ABU DHABI, Monday: Amazing scenes were witnessed at the Sheikh Zayed Stadium in Abu Dhabi where Sri Lanka defended a moderate total of 136 marvelously to pull off a spectacular 21 runs win over Pakistan on the fifth and final day of the first cricket Test yesterday to go one-up in the two-match series.
Pakistan were bowled out for 114 in their second innings  their lowest total in the UAE that has become their home ground since 2010, and it was their first defeat at this venue in 10 Tests.
The man of the moment in Sri Lankas hour of glory was none other than veteran spinner Rangana Herath who has been Pakistans nemesis for several years. Yesterday he demonstrated why he can be considered the best spinner in contemporary cricket when he took a match bag of 11 wickets and in the process completed two milestones  becoming the first left-arm spinner to reach 400 Test wickets and also the first bowler to take 100 Test wickets against Pakistan.
There was an anticlimax to the finish when Heraths spin partner Dilruwan Perera had Yasir Shah caught by Kusal Mendis at short leg and everyone thought including the players and the supporting staff the Test had ended and started congratulating each other. But to their dismay Perera had bowled a no-ball and Yasir survived.
However that no-ball turned out to be a divine hand from above for Herath as it enabled him to take the last Pakistani wicket  that of Mohammad Abbas and reach 400 wickets  the fifth spinner to reach that mark in Test cricket after Muthiah Muralitharan, Shane Warne, Anil Kumble and Harbjahan Singh. The wicket of Mohammad Amir prior to that dismissal brought Herath his 100th against Pakistan. Indian all rounder Kapil Dev had the most Test wickets against Pakistan prior to yesterday with 99.
If Sri Lanka was to defend a modest target of 136 it required something special from the master spinner himself. Herath has never let his country down in such circumstances and he produced a tantalising spell of left-arm bowling to strangle the free-scoring Pakistani batsmen into submission finishing with figures of 6 for 43 off 21.4 overs  figures that confirmed him as one of the greatest bowlers to defend totals in Test history. Herath has 11 fourth innings five-for hauls in comparison to two other legendary spinners Muralitharan and Warne who have seven apiece.
This performance coupled with his first innings effort of 5 for 93 off 40 overs in the first innings easily made Herath the clear candidate for Man of the Match although there were other notable runners for it like skipper Dinesh Chandimal whos marathon knock of 155 not out set the tone for the Lankan first innings and Niroshan Dickwellas two crucial innings of 83 and 40 not out.
Pakistan with a strong batting line up as they displayed in their first innings were pushed onto the back foot by Herath from the fourth over when he had Sami Aslam edging a catch to slip with the total on four. Soon it became 16-3 as Dilruwan Perera and Suranga Lakmal also came to the party.
With the target so small it was a game of see-saw as Pakistan crawled their way to 101-6. The Test stood in the balance with either side capable of winning. But eventually it was Sri Lanka who held their nerve to fashion out a famous and much deserved win after being whitewashed by India in all three formats only a month back. The team was also reeling from the criticism that was levelled against them from all quarters following ODI series defeat to Zimbabwe and a rare Test loss to Bangladesh.
Where the Pakistanis erred was that none of their batters decided to bat positively and take on the Lankan spinners. By trying to play a defensive game they allowed the spinners to dominate the innings so that in their entire second innings there was only four boundaries and one six hit. Their first boundary did not come until the 27th over so tightly did the Lankan spinners weave a web around the Pakistani batsmen.
Sri Lankas chances of saving the Test took a jolt when within the first 38 minutes of play in the morning they lost both overnight batsmen Kusal Mendis and Suranga Lakmal within the space of 13 runs to Mohammad Abbas who was making the ball swing both ways especially on a fifth day pitch and causing a lot of concern to the batsmen.
Sri Lanka lost their remaining six wickets by just doubling their overnight score of 69-4 to be all out for 138 with only Dickwella offering any sort of resistance with a plucky unbeaten knock of 40 off 76 balls.
It was a pity that no one managed to stay with him  with only Sandakan sticking it out for 42 minutes to add 34 but undoing all the good work with a rash cut shot to a wide ball from Yasir that led to his dismissal and the end of the innings at lunch. Yasir finished with five wickets and eight for the match.
It was another case of the lower order not contributing to the total that has become a major issue with the team and needs to be addressed. In the first innings Sri Lankas last five wickets fell for 32 runs and yesterday Dickwella was left without a partner to stay with him. Statistics reveal that the Sri Lankan lower order has the second worst record for batsmen batting between 8 and 11 where they average a lowly 13.
This Test was an extraordinary one. For the first 11 sessions it looked as if it was heading for a meaningless draw. It only came to life in the final session of the fourth day when Sri Lanka lost four wickets for 69 runs and led by only 66. Compared to the first four days 16 wickets fell on a gripping final day yesterday. Who said that Test cricket was dying or boring

Historical roots of Kaurava tribe
Long before the Swiss mathematician Bernoulli in the 17th century discovered the famous theorem named after him, Kaurava boat builders knew the out rigger canoe will sail against the wind, if two sails were rigged in the fore section of the canoe, their math acumen coming from the copious consumption of Omega 3 fatty acid.
The first recorded instance of the existence of these people is the Abhayagiri vihara terrace inscription dating from the 1st century BC denoting a Kaurava navika. (The 1st century was the century that lasted from AD 1 to AD 100. It is often written as the 1st century AD to distinguish it from the 1st century BC which preceded it).
Historical manuscripts such as the Mukkara Hatana indicate that there were several migrations from India including the Kuru Mandalam Coromandal coast of South India. Kaurava people claim an ultimate origin from king Kuru, the founder of the Kuru dynasty described in the epic Kauravas of the Mahabharata, the Sanscript epic describing the Great War between the descendants of Baharata in which the 5 Pandava brothers with the help of Krishna, were victorious over the Kauravas.
The Kaurava people of Sri Lanka came in contact with the Portuguese, Dutch and English and assimilated with regard to education, dress, religion and customs and exploited the new opportunities in commercial enterprises. The Kauravas north of Colombo like the Kurukulasooriyas are mostly Catholics. Those south of Colombo like the Patabendiges are mostly Buddhists. They were seafaring merchants and a naval and military caste and were mercenaries to kings in India and Sri Lanka.
Kandyan chiefs
The Kauravas were entitled to use flags. British Government Agents have noted that not a single flag could be found even in the residencies of Kandyan chiefs as even they were not entitled to use flags. A large number of Kaurava flags have survived the ravages of time. Apart from flags, the Kauravas were the only community entitled to use royal insignia such as pearl umbrellas, swords, tridents, yak tail whisks.
Ge names denote a persons ancestry. The Kauravas traditionally used the title or clan name. Ge names precede an individual personal name unlike a surname which follows ones personal name. The Kaurava Ge names show military, royal or maritime heritage.
Some members of the Kaurava caste descend from a Iberian ancestry dating back to the 16th century, as it is known that the Portuguese men were ordered to marry local women, where apart from the Ge names also used their Iberian derived surnames like Fernando, De Silwa, De Mel, Perera, Dias, Mendis. Often Kauravas also belong to the Suria clans. Kurukulasooriya, Jayasooriya, Weerasooriya, are examples and appear to indicate distinct streams of migration.
Hazardous journey
On an assignment for the ADB, I took a plane from Rangoon to Mandalay and from there to Pagan by Jeep. On the way I got the Anglo Burmese driver, who spoke fluent English, to stop at Amarapura, an ancient capital of Upper Burma, now in ruins.
Removing my shoes, tiptoed into hallowed ground made sacred by countless Kaurava Buddhist monks who travelled here, centuries back from Dodanduwa, Mirissa, Ambalangoda, Panadura, travelling the hazardous journey by sailing ship to Rangoon and from there to Amarapura by foot for their higher ordinations.
It was eerie and the silence deafening as if the ancient monks were watching and the stones crying, weeping and pleading that a Kaurava wealthy merchant, who reads the essay in the Daily News, step forward and build a hermitage allowing that seedling to grow into a mighty tree for a new generation of Sri Lankan Kaurava monks, like their ancestors, may return to their heritage.
The Founder of the Amarapura Nikaya is the Most Venerable Walitota Sri Gnanawimalatissa Maya Thera. The monastic fraternity, Amarapura Nikaya, is named after the city of Amarapura in Burma, the capital of the Konbaung dynasty.

HNB launches Pragna- for education of children at SOS Villages islandwide
Recognizing that knowledge development and education is the basis for a childs intellectual, emotional and social development, HNB together with SOS Childrens Villages, launched the PRAGNA account, to support and fund the education and schooling needs of over 4,500 children, across all of the SOS Childrens Villages in Sri Lanka.
A simple ceremony to mark the occasion was held at SOS Village in Piliyandala, graced by SOS Villages International President Siddhartha Kaul together with top-officials from HNBs senior management.
HNB, Pragna, meaning wisdom, can be accessed across all of HNBs branches islandwide as well as their ATMs. The account will fund and support education of children housed at SOS Villages, most of whom are orphans, without parental care and those at the risk of losing parental care, thereby giving the children an opportunity of good education throughout, including undergraduate studies.
Expressing commitment to the cause, HNBs Managing Director, Jonathan Alles said We believe every child, whatever background, has the right to good education. By simply depositing as little as LKR 100 into the Pragna Account, can change the future of a child. By equipping the children with knowledge and education, undoubtedly gives them a headstart on their journey in life and we at HNB are privileged to be playing a role in it.
Commenting on the initiative, SOS Childrens Villages International President Siddhartha Kaul said: "Education is a prerequisite for preparing young people for a secure life. At SOS Childrens Villages we strongly believe and advocate, investment in education is the best way to ensure a childs future.
"My vision is to empower young people through education enabling them to have employable skills when they leave our care, giving them confidence to stand on their own two feet and make a meaningful life in their society, he added.
Also commenting on HNBs involvement with SOS Childrens Village, HNB Chief Human Resource Officer/Deputy General Manager - Human Resources, Chiranthi Cooray said: It is a true honour for HNB to be able to support such a worthy cause.
The SOS Childrens village has long been involved in Sri Lanka providing life-changing support including family-based, long-term care of children who can no longer grow up with their biological families.
These vital initiatives have helped children across the island to experience reliable relationships that enable them to grow up in a stable family environment hence we urge all who are seeking to make a difference to learn more about SOS Childrens Village and make whatever donation they can towards this important cause.
Currently, there are over 21 students who were brought up at SOS Childrens Villages, in universities in Sri Lanka and overseas.
Pragna by HNB hopes to raise Rs. 120 million by the year 2018, exclusively for schooling and school needs plus tuition and extra educational activities to ensure that the child receives adequate support for quality education. Those seeking to make a deposit towards this worthy cause can make a donation in the name of SOS Village - Pragna Account Number: 038020462474 at Hatton National Bank.

Hughes injury leaves England with No 8 worry
London: England were left with a fitness question mark over Nathan Hughes after the Wasps No 8 suffered a dead leg in a 25-9 Premiership defeat by Bath on Sunday.
Hughes left the field at Wasps Ricoh Arena ground in Coventry after Anthony Watsons knee made contact with his knee during an aerial challenge.
The England back-row forward tried to run the injury off but to no avail.
Hughes should be back soon but England will be anxious for him to regain full fitness quickly as he is in line to replace first-choice No 8 Billy Vunipola for the upcoming end-of-year internationals against Argentina, Australia and Samoa after the Saracens star was ruled out January at the earliest following knee surgery.
Nathan had quite a bad dead leg, said Wasps director of rugby Dai Young.
Hopefully he will recover by next week, but we dont know, the former Wales and British and Irish Lions front-row forward added after a third straight defeat took some of the shine off the clubs 150th anniversary celebrations.
Weve said before it will only be one week and it ends up being longer.
We said that with Danny Cipriani -- one week to 10 days when it was three months, so what do I know
Its a bit early to tell, but hes certainly not looking at knee instability or anything like that, its purely a dead leg. Nathans a big player for us.
Bath ensured a two-match losing streak did not become more severe after Semesa Rokodugunis late try rewarded a strong defensive effort against Wasps, last seasons beaten Premiership finalists.
We made tackle after tackle and we had to do that, said Bath director of rugby Todd Blackadder. We kept ourselves in the right and I thought it was good.
There are a lot of things we can get better at though and this was a real arm wrestle, the former New Zealand international added.
Meanwhile England prop Kyle Sinckler has been cited for an alleged eye-gouging incident in Harlequins Premiership defeat at Northampton on Saturday. Sinckler was accused of the offence by Michael Paterson following an incident that took place in the 49th minute, but referee Luke Pearce decided replay footage was inconclusive and awarded a penalty only for removing the Saints locks scrum cap.

Importance of building techno-entrepreneurship, culture among the business community
The techno-entrepreneurship is using technology to the advancement of business operations. Its evident that business landscape has changed rapidly in the recent past.
We can see the changes in every area in a business including business conduct, in the marketing approach and in the business model concepts. The sustainability of the business should be another concern when formulating a business in the early stage.
Due to this rapid change taking place in the business hemisphere, business people are more concerned with how to make the biggest impact to their customer base or to their market. The importance of techno-entrepreneurship comes in handy at this place. There can be many reasons as to why techno entrepreneurship framework is to be established in todays businesses in the Sri Lankan scenario.
Effective communication between business and consumer
Today, there are more instances where ongoing dialogs between the two parties of a business can result in fruitful business dealings. Suppose, a consumer may want a product that can only be illustrated in a pictorial format. The technology warrants online transfer of data supporting any picture between two parties involved in a business.
In the same way, the transaction details can also be communicated via the internet or using applications in the mobile devices. The benefits can be in many ways. The time involved in the business is much less due to the less time involved in the communication stage. The customer is not only stress-free but knows that his requirements are being fulfilled in the proper way.
In business transactions too, the customer is well secured over his transactions and recording of transactions are much easier. Here, the technology eases the operation of a business and the customer is satisfied over the procedure involved in the business.

It is not uncommon today to send messages to a majority of people by just a click of a button. The online real time messages can be passed to the consumers illustrating the companys latest offerings or its new products.
The messages can be sent using the internal database of a business or to an identified target audience. The messages influences a particular target of business audience to products or services. The cost involved is minimum compared to the traditional paper advertisements.
Technology-an online surveillance watchdog
The rise of digital monitoring and online surveillance pave the way for more security in businesses. The digital options like infrared scanners, motion sensors, heat sensors and water vapour sensors add more security to the business premises. The theft of goods can be minimised if not eradicated by using these options.
Online procurement and order processing
The technology advancement related to this field is tremendous. Ordering of an item in a certain store in Sri Lanka can be a reordering level for a local supplier and the same batch operation trigger the supplier about the quantity and other variations of the product. The same scenario can happen irrespective of country borders and different custom procedures involved in the countries.
Analytical tool in identifying consumer buying patterns
A techno-entrepreneur associates with unusual analytical tools to identify certain and on-going customer buying patterns and behaviours. The various levels of analytical tools including facial recognition and online surveys are being conducted to verify the real concern about the customers. This data is crucial in knowing exact customer requirements and how to align the company products to match them.
Research and development of products
The technology can transform a company to its maximum potential if a new breakthrough is coming under way by its Research and Development (R&D) arm and that is why companies are investing heap of money. The entrepreneur in this aspect can communicate the breakthrough in science by way of a product offering that has new benefits bundled in them. The entrepreneur can even make the offering a habitual product for the current generation and can create a cult among the present generation.
It is so much of a concern in todays business about the applicability of techno- entrepreneurial culture among the business people. The fact is that culture could shape the people. At the same time, the technology can transform people.
One could see the extent to which people have been changed by a single business entity named Facebook. It has proven that new technology can make a difference and change peoples attitudes and their beliefs to a certain extent. It is evident that technology can change people and it impact is based on association; willingness to accept or reject it.
In the same argument, the technology associated with businesses can make a difference to the business conduct and the overall success of the business entity.
In Sri Lankan scenario, many people are reluctant to change their thinking and is cornered. The rise of technology can create waves among the existing businesses and the need to change and be updated with the technology is thoroughly highlighted in this instance.
Business people should not be in their comfort zones thinking that pathsw travelled is safe and secure. You probably do not know the instance where technology could be an impact on you.
The un-travelled path is the path that you need to follow and be concerned with. If not, you would be wiped out from your business by a storm of events where you will not have any time to think about.

KIDNAPPING OF NAZI WAR CRIMINAL ADOLF EICHMANN : RISE FROM THE ASHES
Germany, perhaps the most intelligent and cultured nation at that time, and the country of birth of Goethe, Beethovan and Kaant could democratically elect a raving psychopath like Adolf Hitler as its leader is beyond comprehension.
The Nazi march to power commenced in 1929, when terrible world-wide economic crisis hit Germany. A ridiculous far right party became a political force to be reckoned with. From there it took four years to become the largest party in Germany. The Weimar Republic broke down and step by step they started hoisting the Swastika and raising their arms and saluting Heil Hitler.
German fascism arose from the humiliation of surrender in World War I  the occupation of the Ruhr by France and Belgium from 1923 to 1925 and the terrible economic depression of 1929 - the stage was perfect for Hitler. The ageing President Von Hindenburg was effortlessly eased out.
Hitlers meteoric rise from obscurity to near Emperor of Germany and perhaps the Emperor of the whole world commenced in the 1930s. He had designs to rule, not govern, the whole world.
The word democracy was virtually erased from the vocabulary. Hitler was possessed of a demonic personality, a granite will, uncanny instincts, ruthlessness, remarkable intellect, a soaring imagination and towards the end, when drunk with power and success over- reached himself. To most Germans Hitler would shortly assume the aura of a charismatic leader. They were to follow him blindly for the next several tempestuous years, as if he possessed a Divine Judgement. Considering his origins and his early life, it would be difficult to imagine a more unlikely figure to succeed Bismark, Hohenzollen Emperors, and Field Marshal President Von Hindenberg than this Austrian of peasant stock, born in 1889 across the borders from Bavaria.
The rise of Hitler and his cohorts such as Eichmann instilled in the Germans that their word was law. Anyone who dared to challenge them was tortured and put to death, just like Prabhakaran and his LTTE terrorists. Thence continued the Nazification of Germany.
International law
About 24 Nazi War Criminals were indicted before the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal at the tail end of the Second World War. This Tribunal was set up by the Allies in the war ravaged city of Nuremberg. These Trials had a great influence on the development of International Law. The definition of what constitutes a War Crime is described in the Nuremberg Principles, a document which was created as a result of this Trial. Amongst some of those 24 War Criminals, who were tried at Nuremberg were Martin Bormann, Rudolf Hess, Admiral Karl Doenitz, Ernst Karltenbrunner, Baldur Von Shirach, Arthur Seyss Inquart, Hans Frank.
It was not only Adolf Eichmann on Trial, but the whole Nazi system was in the Dock.
This case is about determining one mans guilt or innocence and establishing the significance of his part in the machine which systematically murdered millions of people in the holocaust.
SS Lieutenant Colonel Adolf Eichmann fled Germany at the tail end of the Second World War, and for over 15 years remained in Buenos Aires, Argentina after having had plastic surgery done to change his face. He, who was the architect of the Final Solution to exterminate 6 million Jews, fled from the Third Reich by means of a secret escape line, which took him via Austria to a monastery in Italy. He assumed the name Ricardo Klement. Under this name he obtained an Argentine visa and continued to live in Buenos Aires. His wife and children joined him in 1952. He worked for Mercedes Benz, receiving a handsome salary.
There was one man in Israel, Simon Wiesenthal, who made it his lifes mission to hound these Nazi war criminals. He was lucky to survive having lost several members of his family in the holocaust. He spent years tracking these war criminals and was finally recognized by the new State of Israel as doing yeoman service to the cause.
This is what our Government should be doing, to track down the LTTE war criminals and those who gave material support, to commit mass murder of innocent Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim people during the 30 years of terror, unleashed by the blood thirsty Prabhakaran and his cohorts. The LTTE rump is still floating around abroad, bribing some western politicians, to restart another killing spree in Sri Lanka. It is most desirable that the government set up a separate ministry to track down these murderers and traitors, to bring them to trial. There are various Ministries for insignificant subjects, such as Botanical Gardens, in the previous Cabinet but no Ministry or a separate Department to monitor the new threat to the country from them. These criminals yet have the assistance of the completely partial UNHRC, and some of the Tamil Nadu politicians. On 23rd May 1960, the first PM of Israel David Ben Gurion, electrified the world by declaring that the architect of the Final Solution was captured at last, and was smuggled out of Argentina and brought to Israel, to stand his trial for the murder of millions of Jews.
Eichmann was tracked down by the Israeli Secret Service and kept for a while under clandestine observation, till he was positively identified. Thereafter he was captured at a bus stop in Argentina on his way home from work, and bundled into a car by a 4-man snatch team. Fearing that the alternative was instant death, Eichmann opted to confess to his identity, on the basis that he would be made to stand trial. Since Israel did not have an Extradition Act with Argentina, the only option was to smuggle him out and be taken to Israel. It was argued that the smuggling out of Eichmann, was a breach of International Law. The question arose as to whether he could be guaranteed a fair trial from a nation born from the ashes of the holocaust.
Brutal killers
The trial itself was on trial! For these reasons the whole affair had to be conducted with meticulous correctitude. Eichmann was afforded every facility, including his own defence lawyers from West Germnay. Seven hundred foreign correspondents were accommodated, together with many internationally known lawyers and historians. Eichmann in the dock, looked appallingly self-confident, like the war criminals at the Nuremberg War Crimes Tribunal. They were such brutal killers, not to be shaken by a mere trial.
He was charged on 15 counts. The Attorney General of Israel Gideon Hausner opened for the prosecution with the words, as I stand here before you, Judges of Israel, to lead the prosecution of Adolf Eichmann, I do not stand alone. With me in this place at this hour stand 6 million accusers. But they cannot rise to their feet and point an accusing finger towards the man who sits in the glass dock and cry, I accuse. For their ashes are piled up in the hills of Aushwitz, and in the fields of Treblinka, or washed away by the rivers of Poland.
One of the witnesses, Rivka Yoselenska from Eastern Poland, described how one of the dreaded einsatzgruppen (the extermination squads) had decended on the Jewish Quarter of her town, in 1941. They were surrounded by SS men who with whips, herded them like animals into the town square, where they were kept overnight without food and water. The next morning, exhausted by terror and fatigue, they were marched out and commanded to undress by a huge pit. They were lined up, shot in the back of the head and kicked into the pit. She saw her mother, grandmother, sister and six-year-old daughter murdered, before her eyes. She with minor injuries fell into the pit, and pretended that she was dead. Her evidence was corroborated when they dug up this pit and unearthed hundreds of rotting remains.
Eichmann joined the Nazi party in 1932, at the age of 26, as SS officer. He quickly made a name for himself as a specialist in Jewish affairs. He taught himself Hebrew and Yiddish. Attached to the Viennese Gestapo, Eichmann initiated a scheme for the mass emigration of Jews from Austria. Throughout the war he headed the Jewish Dept. He was not a man who could plead like others before him, that he did not know about the Final Solution. Instead he adopted the alternative line that he was only obeying orders. He has said, why waste bullets for the Jews when there is a cheaper thing called gas. His intention of extermination was proved beyond all reasonable doubt.
Eichmann was no mere cog in the machinery of annihilation. He was the dynamo. Tirelessly he scoured Europe for Jews for deportation, appearing now in France, now in Chechoslovakia, now in Belgium, to accelerate and encourage the Purge. He was a cold blooded and calculating murderer, and showed himself to be completely obsessed with the idea of destroying every single Jew he could lay hands on. Even the loathsome Ernst Kaltenbrunner hanged for War Crimes at Nuremberg, relented. But not Adolf Eichmann.
Truck loads of Jews packed like sardines were dispatched to Auschwitz. Eichmann defied Hitlers orders, protesting that Jews are important biological material, many of them veteran Zionists whose emigration to Palestine is most undesirable.
Adolf Eichmann was found guilty by an Israeli Court and sentenced to death. His Appeal too, failed. On the night of May 31, 1962, he was taken from his cell and hanged. His last words were, I had to obey the rules of war and my flag. Thereafter he was cremated and his ashes were thrown to the sea, well beyond the Israeli three mile limit.

Lankan passenger carrying gold in rectum caught at Vizag airport
Customs officials of the Air Intelligence Unit at the Vizag Airport detained an international passenger on the charges of carrying gold biscuits in his rectum on Sunday.
Refusing to reveal the identity of the passenger, the officials said he had landed at the city airport in a Sri Lankan Airways flight around 9.30 am.
Initially, it was suspected that he was carrying cocaine, but a senior officer, on condition of anonymity, said the passenger was trying to smuggle gold bars.
The person could be carrying around 800 grams of gold, he said. Customs officials grew suspicious of the passengers behaviour as he was walking awkwardly and rushed through the green channel meant for passengers carrying non-dutiable goods.
Officials detained him and conducted confirmatory screening tests which revealed that he was carrying something in his rectum. Sources identified the passenger as Abdul Razak, 50, who flew in from Colombo. Officials are yet to confirm the information.
The passenger has been sent to the King George Hospital for a total body scanning procedure. Police denied having any official information about the incident. - The New Indian Express

Lawyer intervenes in former CJs FR
Attorney-at-law and public interest litigation activist Aruna Laksiri yesterday filed an intervention petition seeking Supreme Courts jurisdiction to dismiss (in limine) the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva who challenged the enactment procedure of Provincial Council Election Bill.
On September 28, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva filed a Fundamental Rights petition at the Supreme Court seeking an Interim Order by way of a direction that the amendments purported to be made to the Provincial Council Election Bill at the committee stage of the Parliament on September 20 shall not be operative till the final determination of this petition.
Filing an Intervention petition in the Supreme Court, attorney-at-law Aruna Laksiri maintained that the former Chief Justice cannot challenge a Bill passed in Parliament since it becomes law when the certificate of the Speaker is endorsed in terms of Article 80 (1) of the Constitution.
A Bill passed in Parliament cannot be challenged in Court through a Fundamental Rights petition, the intervention petitioner added.
Laksiri further stated that former Chief Justice has filed this Fundamental Rights petition contrary to the provisions of the Constitution and undermining the sovereignty of the people exercised by Parliament. He further said the Fundamental Rights petition filed by former Chief Justice was erroneous since the Speaker had been named as a respondent, contrary to the Parliament Privileges Act.
He further alleged that the former Chief Justice is attempting to misuse the legal process of the country and moved the Supreme Court to dismiss former Chief Justices Fundamental Rights in limine. In his Fundament Rights petition, former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva sought a declaration that the Fundamental Rights of the petitioner guaranteed by article 12(1) of the constitution has been infringed or is likely to be infringed by the executive or administrative actions of respondents.
The former Chief Justice cited Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Attorney General Jayantha Jayasuriya and Chairman and members of Election Commission as respondents.
The former Chief Justice is also seeking a declaration that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya is not empowered by law to certify in terms of article 79 of the constitution that the Provincial Council Election Bill which was passed at the second reading by parliament and operative provisions of which were entirely deleted and new provisions purporting to be amendments to the Provincial Council Election Act No.2 of 1988.
The petitioner stated that the government attempted to postpone the said elections by means of the twentieth amendment to the Constitution which was challenged and Supreme Court determined that the Bill is inconsistent with the Constitution and should be approved by people at referendum. The petitioner stated that upon the said determination the government decided not to proceed with the said amendment and decided to proceed with the Bill as to the quota of female candidates.

Malwatte Mahanayake tells Dinesh : PRESIDENT, PMs ASSURANCES ON CONSTITUTION SUFFICIENT
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had said the proposed new Constitution would safeguard the countrys unitary status and the pre-eminent place afforded to Buddhism. Therefore, the country can rely and place confidence on the assurances given by them, Malwatte Mahanayake Most Ven.Tibbotuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala Thera said.
When the two leaders ruling the country have given such an assurance there is no point in questioning about its validity, the Malwatte Prelate said.
The Malwatte Chief Prelate expressed these sentiments when Parliamentarian Dinesh Gunawardene called on him at his temple in Kandy and presented a document containing observations and comments of the Joint Opposition (JO) group about the interim report of the Steering Committee on constitutional reforms yesterday. Gunawardene said a copy of the document had been submitted to the Steering Committee too.
The Malwatte Mahanayake Thera who reminded Dinesh Gunawardena that he (Gunawardene) and several other Joint Opposition members had participated in various steering committees on Constitutional Reforms added that they had the discretion to oppose if any harmful decisions were taken at that stage.
The Malwatte Mahanayake Thera said it was better to submit ideas and news for the formulation of a good Constitution beneficial to the country without taking a firm stand saying a Constitution was not needed. He said he would always raise objections if any decisions inimical to the country nation and religion were taken. The prelate who noted that there was a group who stood up to oppose anything and everything said a similar situation happened during the signing of the Bandaranaike-Chelvanayakam Pact which took the country towards a setback.
The Chief Prelate who commended the introduction of the First Past the Post system in place of the present system of elections added that the activities of Provincial Councils had degenerated to such a low level that no one knew whether they were functioning or not.
MP Dinesh Gunawardene said the interim report included clauses which threatened the Unitary Status of the country and the protection of Buddhism. He also said that the Sinhala copy and the English copy of the interim report differed as regards the historical status of the country.
The Mahanayake Thera said whom to believe is the question baffling him today. He had to ask the question as to who uttered more lies.

MAS Holdings inks chemical leasing deal with JAT holdings
MAS Holdings has inked a chemical leasing deal with JAT holdings paint supplier with the aim of reducing chemical usage in their plants and ensuring products are zero toxic by 2020.
As a part of a long term commitment on Environmental Sustainability Aelian Gunawardene, Managing Director of JAT Holdings (Pvt) Ltd and Chelan Goonetilleke, Chief Executive Officer of MAS Active Trading (Pvt) Ltd and their respective teams came together to sign this agreement.
The objective of the agreement is to environmentally and economically optimize a chemicals life cycle. A specification of the agreement is that the chemical supplier is paid for the usage area of chemicals and not the number of units of chemicals provided. The end user, in order to reduce cost will reduce the amount of chemicals used and opt to recycling at all possible instances.
Benefits of this agreement revolve around the chemical supplier, end user and the environment. As a result of the reduction in chemical consumption and waste, a considerable reduction in air and water pollution will occur. This induces a reduction in emission of the production process leading to a low carbon footprint.
The low amount of chemicals used and the high amount of chemicals recovered, lead to a low cost of production. This value addition shared by both the supplier and the end user provides a dual economic advantage when applying the ChL business model.

Mattala will be a busy airport in future - Jetwing Director
With the development of the Hambantota Port, the planned oil refinery, and more luxury hotels opening in the Southern Province, Mattala international airport will be a busy aerodrome in the future, says Jetwing Air Director Sunil Peiris.
A veteran of the airline industry, Peiris, who served the national carrier SriLankan in senior management positions, sees huge potential for the Mattala airport. It has lot of unused land that can be developed.
Jetwing, the GSA for budget airline flydubai, owned by the Emirates Group, has operated uninterrupted to the Southern airport since it opened in March 2013 and currently has four weekly services.
Jetwing is also in close talks with the Ministry of Labour to have Sri Lankans seeking employment in Dubai and living in the South and East to opt to travel from Mattala instead of Colombo, Peiris said.
Peiris says with the development of the Hambantota Port and the opening of five star hotels like the Shangri La, Anantara Tangalle, Marriott Weligama, two Hilton hotels in the deep South and other new hotels opening in Tissa and Yala, Mattala will be a bustling airport in the future.
He says they have flown down groups for special events such as weddings and corporate events at the South coast hotels. Peiris believes that in the future tourists visiting Sri Lankas pristine Southern and Eastern coasts will opt to fly directly to Mattala instead of Colombo.
With all of these developments, the Jetwing Director was very positive about the advancement of the islands Southern coast which in turn would contribute to the overall economic growth of the nation
While the Colombo international airport was being refurbished earlier this year, SriLankan Airlines' China bound flights made a stopover in Mattala and saw heavy movement of passengers from Mattala.
It is expected that the extension of the Southern Expressway to Hambantota and the rail link too would secure additional business to Mattala airport.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has on several occasions said that the government would also look at leasing Mattala airport to Indians similar to the Chinese harbour lease to cut debt repayment.

The proposed new Constitution after being adopted by Parliament with a two thirds majority, should be placed before the people at a Referendum to seek their approval as it is the most appropriate thing to do, said Ven. Dimbukumbure Wimaladhamma Anunayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter.
Ven. Wimaladhamma Thera said a copy of the interim report of the Steering Committee on Constitutional Reforms submitted to Parliament had been reviewed by him too.
The Anunayake Thera said this during the course of an Anusasana when Home Affairs Minister Vajira Abeywardene called on him at the Malwattee Viharaya and received his blessings on September 29.
The Anunayake Thera said the government had still not formulated a draft Constitution bill and what had been tabled was only an interim report of the Steering Committee. But some detractors were trying to whip up public opinion by giving a wrong picture about it to the country.
He said he never believed that the government would introduce a new Constitution inimical to the national interest. If that happened, the Maha Sangha would strongly oppose it. But he did not condone efforts made by certain sectors of the Maha Sangha to dabble in politics and trying to propagate political agendas of certain parties.
He said he will study the interim report and announce his observations on it to the country.

New houses received by needy families in Kuliyapitiya Division
Arrangements have been made to build housing schemes in Colombo to accommodate 4000 police officers, IGP Pujith Jayasundera said.
He was addressing a meeting held at the Narammala Police Station to mark the handing over of keys to nine new houses built for the benefit of nine needy families by eight police stations in Kuliyapitiya division concurrent to the police mobile services held in the regions recently.
Pujith Jayasundera said, police mobile services were being held throughout the country under six categories, namely Sports, Shramadana, Health, Education, Culture and Religion. So far services with a financial value of nearly Rs. 470 million had been accomplished under this program.
It not only involved infrastructure like village roads or school and temple buildings but also entertainment programs for children and Do You Know contests. The objective of these programs was to enhance police public relations. It would not only help in a great way to combat crime and drug trafficking but also net in undesirable elements.This would also enable police to implement the law and identify people damaging the environment.
He said, police should always try to win public confidence. He had directed all police stations to resolve at least 75 percent of the reported crimes before December 31 this year. He added, the government had set up an Independent Police Commission to eliminate political interference in police activities. The police force had also been enhanced and the number of police stations increased to 487.Police promotions were now given according to a marks scheme.
The Maha Sangha led by Ven. Mugunawatuna Siddhartha Chief Sanghanayaka Thera of Wayamba Province, DIG Jagath Dharmasiri Gunawardena and SP Kapila Kadupitiya were also present.

Ocean Glider Challenger reaches Mirissa
The Ocean Glider Challenger, which set sail for Sri Lanka in November last year from Western Australia, reached Mirissa on September 29. It was the longest journey ever attempted by an autonomous underwater vehicle.
The Glider had covered 7570 km in over 330 days (nearly 11 months), making it the longest ever glider transactor in history.
Finance State Minister Eran Wickramaratne said the data collected using the Challenge Ocean Glider would also help Sri Lanka overcome issues pertaining to ocean climate change.
He said Sri Lanka was chosen to play a significant part as the mission concerned collecting data on the Indian Ocean.
Minister Wickramaratne speaking at a press conference held in the Hilton Colombo said each year has been warmer than the previous year in Sri Lanka and added that there was also an acceleration in the occurrence of natural disasters.
He said the country need affordable, reliable energy and solar power was not a choice anymore.
Let us not politicise these issues that concern the well-being of the country. Some countries have targets to go for renewable energy, a ban on fossil fuels and use of renewable energy on plantation and manufacturers. We also need to conserve biodiversity through policy and legislation, much is to be done, the State Minister said.
According to University of Western Australia Professor of Coastal Oceanography Charitha Pattiaratchi, the Challenger Glider Mission had captured and communicated unprecedented undersea data, he said.
It will help determine how changes in currents, temperatures and salinity affect weather patterns and give scientists a deeper understanding into the issues that raise due to changing climate, he said.
He said they collect data across the ocean basins and compare the previous measurements to identify how ocean has changed.
Prof. Pattiaratchi said that previously data about ocean were gathered with the help of ships and the ocean glider was a more cost effective and efficient technology.
The ocean glider is the Teledyne Webb Slocum electric glider: a 2.2 metre autonomous underwater vehicle, which collects data as it moves through the ocean in a saw-tooth shaped trajectory, achieving a forward speed of 25 to 35 km per day. It captures continuous ocean readings and transmit it to researchers in near real-time via satellite network when the glider surfaces.
The ocean glider is to circumnavigate the rim of the Indian Ocean, taking a further two years.The endeavour is part of a partnership between the UWA and the Rutgers University under the auspices of the Australian Integrated Marine Observing System (IMOS) and the US Integrated Ocean Observing System (IOOS).

Passion driven
Soprano Tharanga Goonetillekes life achievements are enviable and admirable. She will be performing with the Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka on October 19 at Ladies College.
Being a native of Sri Lanka, she graduated with her Artist Diploma for Opera Studies as well as her Master of Music degree in Voice and Opera at the Juilliard School. She has a Bachelor of Music degree from Converse College, Spartanburg, SC, USA with a minor in Biology. She is also an Associate of the Trinity College of Music, London, England.
In her home country, Goonetilleke made her solo debut with The Symphony Orchestra of Sri Lanka (SOSL) after winning the Concerto Competition of Sri Lanka in 1998. In addition, she has won the Trinity College of Music examination prizes in singing for three consecutive years for which achievement she was awarded the Yamaha Trophy in 1997. Since then she has been a frequent performer with the SOSL.
In the US she has been adjudged a winner in both New York and South Carolina districts at the Metropolitan Opera National Council auditions. She is also a winner of the Palmetto Opera competition in Columbia, SC. The Sri Lanka Association in California presented her with an Award of Excellence in performance. At Juilliard she was awarded the Makiko Narumi Memorial prize and is a recipient of the Sing for Hope Grant awarded to recent alumni of Julliard. Goonetilleke is the first woman from Sri Lanka to be accepted to the prestigious Juilliard School.
Daily News contacted Goonetilleke and spoke about the woman behind the mike, the woman off stage.
My first music teacher was my mom. Then I studied voice with Christine Perera and piano with Ponraja and Prema Ratnayake while I was in Sri Lanka. Then I studied voice with Dr. Beverly Hay (Converse College, SC, USA) and Marlena Malas (The Juilliard School, NY, USA), said Goonetilleke.
The concert is very special for Goonetilleke for two reasons. First, this concert will be dedicated to the memory of Dr. Earl de Fonseka who was the founder of SOSL.
I was lucky enough to have met him and sing for him in the late 1990s and he encouraged me to continue on the path of music for which I am truly grateful. Second, this would be my first time performing under the baton of Dushyanthi Perera whose cello playing and musicality has always been an inspiration to me especially as a child growing up in Sri Lanka, stated Goonetilleke.
Her passion for music is thrilling and inspiring. Her performances are magical and can lift anyone up from the doldrums. It is this mutual passion for music, this collaboration that will make the performance to remember for a very long time.
Whether I am singing with the SOSL or any other symphony anywhere else in the world, the process is the same. As the soloist, I only will be present for two or three rehearsals before the concert. And when I attend the first rehearsal, the orchestra and I have independently rehearsed the music well enough to be able to adjust, to meet mutually in musical sensibilities and temperament. Flexibility is key on everyones part. The success of the work of both parties (myself and the orchestra) is very much dependent on how well we all know the music and how much of our heart we are willing to expose. It is a large responsibility for anyone on stage. The more vulnerable the musicians are the more exciting and the more magical the performance will be, explained Goonetilleke.
Lost in the music she discovers herself. Lost in the music she finds her purpose in life. Lost in her music she reaches deep within herself and lives up to her potential which is massive. Her talent is impressive. The more she performs the more she grows as a musician. The more she is able to share that part of herself with us and lift us up. And listening to her, we discover a part of ourselves as well.
I feel that it is probably because there is nothing else that makes me feel that I am fully myself except when I am totally lost in music. I do write music and poetry for fun. However, I dont perform them professionally. Singing and voice training alone consume us, said Goonetilleke
There is no better person who can deliver a message to any young person who wants to enter the music industry other than Goonetilleke.
Dont get passion and fun mixed up. If you are in music because it is fun, it could simply be a passing interest. Passion will last a lifetime and you will be heartbroken if you dont give it a chance. Anything you do only for fun can be replaced by the next fun thing that comes along. So, when you chose your career, hopefully you will evaluate these differences. The music industry and career is not always fun but it is full of passion; it is a mix of electricity, heartache, exhilaration, freedom, liberation and more, in combination with unwavering hard work, informed Goonetilleke.
She is a permanent resident of the USA and tries to come to Sri Lanka every two years or so if she can. The artistes she admires are Kiri te Kanawa, Leontyne Price, Lorraine Hunt Lieberson, Renee Fleming, and Sarah Connolly.
I founded TharangArt. It is a visual arts project I started during a period of time a couple of years back when I was medically advised to be on bed rest. I thought Id go crazy if I didnt have a way to channel my creative energy somewhere. I took up drawing. Since then I have shown my artwork at least in a dozen shows, some of my designs are used in the Julliard store at Lincoln center etc. Lately I am working on collaborating these two different artistic outlets. For example, when I get back to the USA in November I will be travelling to Canada to perform a recital at Wilfred Laurier University while I will be displaying some of my artwork they have commissioned, explained Goonetilleke.
In 2015, she became a TED Fellow and it has been a life- changing honor for her. When asked as to what sustains her and strengthens her, she pointed out that it is her God, her two children, her husband and music and art.
Ladies College education has impacted me in every imaginable way, whether it is professional or personal. I was in school with a remarkably intelligent, talented and compassionate batch of women at Ladies. They along with my wonderful teachers have made me the woman I am today by allowing me unwrap the girl I was then, summed up Goonetilleke.

Qatar Airways Announces $2.16 billion Boeing order
Qatar Airways has announced an order for two Boeing 747-8 Freighters and four 777-300ERs, valued at $2.16 billion at list prices. The order, a sign of the airlines continued expansion and contribution to the US economy, adds to the airlines current fleet of nearly 100 Boeing widebody airplanes and its more than 100 additional Boeing aircraft on order.
The announcement was made at a delivery ceremony in Everett, Washington, where the airline also received the first of its 747-8 Freighters. The ceremony was attended by Qatar Airways Group Chief Executive Akbar Al Baker, Boeing Vice Chairman Ray Conner and Boeing Commercial Airplanes Chief Executive Officer Kevin McAllister. Al Baker, said: Qatar Airways operates one of the youngest and fastest-growing fleets in the sky and Boeing unceasingly proves to be a valuable partner to us in providing the quality aircraft that make us the worlds third largest international cargo carrier. We are very appreciative of our enduring partnership with Boeing, as it is key to our future growth, and we look forward to continuing to work with this important US partner.
McAllister said: We are proud of our strong, enduring and growing partnership with Qatar Airways and we truly appreciate the value its business has brought to Boeing, its employees, suppliers and our communities. As one of the worlds largest international cargo carriers, it is heartening that Qatar Airways has selected the 747-8 Freighter to meet its growing cargo operations and to see the important role the 777-300ER continues to play in its long-haul fleet.
There have been many milestones in Qatar Airways relationship with Boeing and this announcement is the latest development in this strong relationship. Qatar Airways was the first airline to operate the 787 in the Middle East, is a launch customer for the 777X, and has twenty 737 MAX airplanes on order. In 2016 the airline placed a record $11.7 billion order from Boeing for 30 B787-9 Dreamliners and 10 777-300ERs.
The 747-8 Freighter gives cargo operators the lowest operating costs and best economics of any large freighter airplane while providing enhanced environmental performance. It is optimised to provide greater revenue cargo-carrying capability than the 747-400, offering 16 per cent more cargo volume while keeping its unique nose door.
Qatar Airways has a host of exciting new destinations planned for the remainder of this year and 2018, including Canberra, Australia; Chiang Mai, Thailand and Mombasa, Kenya, to name just a few.

World Tourism Day comes at a time when Qatars tourism sector is experiencing exciting and monumental change. Last month, Qatars Ministry of Interior, Qatar Tourism Authority, and Qatar Airways launched visa-free entry to Qatar for citizens of more than 80 countries.
Last year it also introduced a 96-hour transit visa, which allowed passengers transiting at Hamad International Airport the option of leaving the airport and exploring the city for up to of 96 hours, as long as they had a return ticket.

REACHING THE SACRED PEAK
The annual Sri Pada Pilgrimage season begins on Duruthu Pasalosvak Poya with religious ceremonies conducted at Sri Sumana Saman Devalaya, invoking the blessings of the Sri Sumana Saman deity on pilgrims climbing Sri Pada Mountain.
The path to the summit of Sri Pada Mountain remained a mystery until it was discovered with the help of the gardener who showed the way to King Nissankamalla of the Kalinga dynasty who hailed from South India. He was the son of King Ghosha and Queen Parvati who ascended the throne and ruled Raja Rata from Polonnaruwa for nine years and visited Sri Pada Mountain during the latter part of his rule. The legend has it that King Nissankamalla climbed the mountain to pay his obeisance at the Sacred Footprint of The Buddha on the summit on the Duruthu Pasalosvaka Poya.
There are legends and beliefs related to the worship of the Sacred Footprint. The foreign visitors from far flung lands have climbed Sri Pada Mountain and left their impressions about the sacred summit in their writings. Ibn Batuta was one of the visitors who wrote in his travels how he climbed the mountain terrain.
There is a popular belief that butterflies make their journey heading towards Sri Pada Mountain during this season, hence the name Samanala Kanda. Prof. Senarath Paranavithana too had made his observations about the worship of the Sri Pada in his writings.
The mountain was sanctified by the visit of The Buddha at the invitation of the Sri Sumana Saman deity and placed his Sacred Footprint on the summit of the mountain to mark his third visit to Sri Lanka. Thus Sri Pada Mountain became one of the most sacred places of Buddhist worship in Sri Lanka where Buddhists visit at least once in their lifetime.
It is a common sight to see the arrival of pilgrims in vans, cars, buses and other modes of travel to Nallathanni in the evening and prepare to climb the mountain braving the cold misty weather. Then they trudge across the abandoned tea land and commence their climbing the steep terrain forming into a group called Nade led by a Nade Gura to lead kodukarayas who are those visiting for the first time.
Karunavai, Karunavai, Karunavai  May there be compassion is a common way of greeting each other while ascending and descending the Sri Pada Mountain by the Nade Guras and rest of the groups. Nade gura begins to chant verses from Thumsaranaya extolling the virtues of the Buddha, Dhamma and Sangha in his sonorous notes which the others in his group following him keep chanting line by line. These chanting make the pilgrims blessed spiritually and uplift their spirits from weariness.
Along the path to the summit there are many historic places pilgrims pass through. The road from Hatton is known as Raja Rata Mawatha. After passing Indikatupana and arriving at Seethagangula where icy cold water gushes down from ravines above, forming into water pools, pilgrims usually wash their hands, feet and faces.
There is a cave known as Nissankalena. On the summit there is a two acre flat rock surface, Samyaamadama, the resting place of the visiting bhikkhus and below the rock there is a rock cave with a drip ledge carved to drain the rain water preventing it from getting inside the cave.
Inside the cave there is a figure of a king standing, said to be of King Nissankamalla and beside it stands the Saman Devale. The king learnt the secret path from a gardener who looked after the royal flower garden. Having found some flowers missing every morning, he decided to be vigilant and kept awake one night and was able to detect the thief who steals the flowers. To his surprise it was a fairy who confessed the flowers were taken to worship at the Sacred Footprint on the summit of the mountain.
It is recorded that king Nissankamalla travelled along Raja Mawatha and worshipped at the Sacred Footprint and visited Divaguhava or Bhaghava lena where The Buddha rested lying 300 feet below the summit. It is said the king commissioned a statue of him showing himself worshipping the Sacred Footprint and inscribed a rock inscription in 14 lines.
There is also another inscription at Ambagamuwa which was the entrance to Raja Mawatha that led to the route on which king Nissankamalla travelled. The details in the inscription mention that the king donated a number of villages for the maintenance of Sri Pada and to meet the needs of the pilgrims who visited.
The inscription said that those who make use of the revenue from these villages for their own needs would be born as cats, dogs and cows in their future births.
In addition to Raja Mawatha the other route is Palabaddala. There is another inscription similar to Gilimale which mentions that the revenue from Bambarakotuwa village should be used for those who visit Sri Pada on pilgrimage.
Pilgrims climb the steep rocky surface walking on the steps with the help of the iron railings and make their way at snails pace till they reach the summit to witness Ira Sewaya - homage of the sun to the Sacred Footprint.
The eastern horizon gets lit up with the rays of the morning sun and then darkness. This process repeats and finally the golden disc of the sun appears much to the delight of pilgrims paying homage to the Sacred Footprint.

Smith blames Australias poor decisions for India loss
NAGPUR: Australia skipper Steve Smith has blamed his teams poor decision making under pressure after their demoralising 4-1 loss to India in the one-day internationals.
The visitors suffered a seven-wicket thrashing in the final ODI in Nagpur on Sunday to slip to third in the world rankings. They started the series in second spot.
The latest defeat was Australias 12th loss in their last 15 ODIs away from home -- a worrying loss of form for the team just two months ahead of a home Ashes series against England.
Were just not taking our words out in the middle and doing it with actions. We have glimpses of it and we play well in periods and then we just get ourselves in trouble, Smith told reporters in Nagpur.
Probably from poor decision making under pressure, thats what I probably put it down to. Thats something that we need to improve on because its not good enough. Australia, who came to India off the back of a disappointing Test series in Bangladesh that ended 1-1, failed to capitalise on favourable positions throughout their four losses.
The visitors allowed India to reach 281-7 after having them reeling at 87-5 in the first ODI. The Australian batsmen also faltered against Indias wrist spinners.
Probably lacking consistency with the bat Id say ... I think were losing wickets in clumps very consistently and thats not good enough, said Smith.
We probably didnt adapt as well as we would have liked. Top Australian batsmen were guilty of not converting their starts into bigger scores, costing the visitors against a formidable Indian side.
Smiths own form with the bat was not up to his usual high standards in the five matches, scoring 142 runs with two half-centuries. David Warner and Aaron Finch were the only Australian batsmen to make centuries.
I wasnt feeling great at the start of the series to be honest. I wasnt holding the bat the way I would have liked to, said Smith.
As the leader of the team its been disappointing but I guess sometimes thats cricket. You have those periods where youre not getting the scores you like.
Its something hopefully I can turn around and hopefully contribute in the T20s. Smith played his 100th ODI in the series, having made his debut back in 2010.
Australia now head to Ranchi for the three-match Twenty20 series starting Saturday. The second and third T20s will be played on October 10 and 13 in Guwahati and Hyderabad.

South Africa beat Bangladesh by 333 runs in 1st Test
Potchefstroom: The pace of Kagiso Rabada and the spin of Keshav Maharaj sent Bangladesh crashing to a 333-run defeat on the fifth day of the first Test against South Africa at Senwes Park on Monday.
Bangladesh lost seven wickets for 41 runs in less than an hour and a half as they were bowled out for 90 after being set 424 to win.
South Africas victory was overshadowed by an injury to fast bowler Morne Morkel, who is expected to be out for six weeks.
Rabada started the destruction by taking the first three wickets of the morning. He finished with three for 33, while left-arm spinner Maharaj took four for 25.
Resuming on 49 for three, Bangladesh lost their captain, Mushfiqur Rahim, to the 12th ball of the morning when he pushed at a lifting delivery from Rabada and was well caught above his head by Hashim Amla at first slip for 16.
Mahmudullah was bowled off an inside edge when he played a tentative defensive shot against the fast bowler and Liton Das offered no shot and was leg before wicket to a ball which slanted in to him. Sabbir Rahman and Taskin Ahmed were both leg before to Maharaj before Shafiul Islam was run out when he and Mehedy Hasan attempted a third run against the strong fielding arm of Rabada after a relay throw from twelfthman Wayne Parnell, who chased a ball to long-off.
Hasan and last batsman Mustafizur Rahman shared the best partnership of the morning, putting on 15 before Mustafizur pushed back a return catch to Maharaj.
Bangladeshs rapid demise meant that South Africa were hardly hampered by the absence of Morkel, who suffered a side strain after taking the first two wickets on Sunday.
Team manager Mohammed Moosajee said Morkel required around six weeks rest, ruling him out of the second Test in Bloemfontein, starting on Friday.
South Africa dominated the match after Rahms surprising decision to send them in to bat on an easy-paced pitch, with Dean Elgar (199), new cap Aiden Markram (97) and Hashim Amla (137) enabling them to score 496 for three declared in the first innings. AFP

Sri Lankan refugee in Papua New Guinea takes his own life
The death of a Sri Lankan Tamil refugee in Papua New Guinea is the sixth fatality on Manus Island in four years.
Australias immigration department confirmed the death at Lorengau Hospital but directed inquiries to PNG authorities.
Authorizes believe the 32-year-old man took his own life early on Monday morning. The mans death is reportedly the second suicide on the island in the past two months.
Former Manus Island MP Ron Knight said the magistrate on the island will be conducting a coroners investigation over coming days.
It seems like a suicide but its not confirmed yet, Knight told AAP. He said locals had become increasingly frustrated with the problems that have come with hosting the immigration detention centre, which is slated for closure at the end of the month. Its given the island a bad name, its given the people a bad name, when people are being looked after by our government and the Australian government has to resort to something like this to prove a point, it means that something is terribly wrong with the whole system, Knight said. Refugee Action Coalition spokesman Ian Rintoul said the man had been sent to the hospital three days earlier. Greens senator Nick McKim said the case was catastrophic neglect from Immigration Minister Peter Dutton.
This man had suffered for years in a system that Australias Labor and Liberal parties deliberately designed and operated to cause mental harm, he said in a statement.
The body of Iranian refugee Hamed Shamshiripour was found near refugee accommodation in early August. The death comes as more than 50 refugees last week left Manus Island and Nauru for a new life in the U.S. More are expected to follow in coming months.

State Pharmaceuticals Corporation targets Rs 1.9 bn profit by end 2017
The State Pharmaceuticals Corporation (SPC) a state-owned enterprise will once again record a profit in the excess of Rs. 1.9 billion by end of 2017 said its Chairman, Sarath Liyange.
In an interview with Daily News business he however said that the profit was around Rs 2.5 billion in 2016.
We will fall short of previous year profit due to the lowering of prices of some of the essential pharmaceutical items by the government this year.
He said that the corporation in the last two years has made a remarkable turnaround emerging as a profit making organization.
SPC set up in 1974 is the largest supplier of drugs in the country, and is tasked with providing quality-assured health care items that are safe and effective, at an affordable price, while educating the public on the rational use of drugs. It also employees about 600 staff. I am ashamed to admit that SPC was branded as a one of the most corrupt state owned entities and we have now changed and this is one of the main reasons for the organization to be making profits once again.
He also said that with quality drugs SPC once again won confidence and also regained back its market share and has opened new outlets to reach out to the masses. We are also moving some of the Osu Sala outlets to our own premises, which are better locations and this too will cut costs and bring in more business.
Liyanage said that they have decided to stop all medical drug imports to the country by 2020.
To meet this objective we have tied up with both local and foreign Pharmaceutical manufacturing companies to set up their factories in Sri Lanka. We have given them a buy back grantee and pharmaceutical companies have already set up two of the regions largest manufacturing plants in Horana and Koggala. They are also allowed to import tax free and this is encouraging more companies to come and start factories in Sri Lanka.
Currently SPC manufactures Jeevani health energy drink and 47 other items and they may also look at increasing the precut line in the future.
He also said that in a bid to share some of their projects they would offer around 70% salary increment to the staff in several stages. Picture by Mahinda Vithananchchci

Terror on Las Vegas Strip after deadly shooting spree
US: Over 50 people were killed and more than 200 wounded when a gunman went on a shooting spree at a concert on the famous Las Vegas Strip late Sunday, police and US media reports said.
Police said the shooter was taken down after officers swarmed over the famous boulevard in response to multiple shots being fired from the Mandalay Bay casino resort towards thousands of fans at a country music concert.
Revelers screamed and fled in panic as a steady stream of gunfire rang out at the venue, footage captured on smart phones showed. At this time we do have a suspect down, Las Vegas police officer Steve Gomez told reporters, without elaborating.
We have numerous victims right now, he added.
While police did not immediately give a figure for the number of dead, CNN reported that at least two people had been killed.
Pictures taken at the scene showed revelers cowering in the street or running in terror, as well what appeared to be several bodies lying prone on the ground. A local hospital was taking in several people with gunshot wounds, University Medical Center spokeswoman Danita Cohen told the local Sun newspaper.
Video footage circulating on social media showed a large crowd enjoying a concert as part of the Route 91 country music festival just outside the casino before what sounded like volleys of automatic gunfire halted the performance.
We heard (what) sounded like a glass breaking, so you looked around to see whats going on and then heard a pop, pop, pop, Monique Dekerf told CNN.
Youd think for a moment okay were fine, theres no more gunfire, then it starts again. Her sister Rachel said it sounded like the shots were coming from the right side ... it sounded like they were right beside us too ... it was right there. Fans said that the best-selling singer Jason Aldean was on stage at the time of the shooting which came towards the end of the concert.
We were watching the concert having a great time, then we heard what sounded like firecrackers, witness Joe Pitz was quoted as saying by the local Las Vegas Sun news outlet. I guess it was an automatic weapon going off but it literally sounded like firecrackers. Then soon enough there was commotion on the Mandalay Bay side of the stage. They were motioning for medics to come and safety people to come and Jason Aldean ran off the stage. Everybody in the vicinity went down. I dont know if they were ducking or if they were but it was chaos. Another witness told local TV news station KLAS that he saw someone several stories high firing hundreds of shots into a crowd of people. Police however denied reports of multiple shooters. At this time we do not believe there are any more shooters, the department wrote on Twitter. A shocked Aldean told his fans via Instagram that he and his band was safe. Tonight has been beyond horrific, the singer wrote.
I still dont know what to say ... My Thoughts and prayers go out to everyone involved tonight. It hurts my heart that this would happen to anyone who was just coming out to enjoy what should have been a fun night. - AFP

US musician Tom Petty dies aged 66

US musician Tom Petty has died in California aged 66, says a statement issued on behalf of his family.
Petty was found unconscious, not breathing and in full cardiac arrest at his Malibu home early on Monday.
He was taken to hospital, but could not be revived and died later that evening.
Petty was best known as the lead singer of Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers, and his hits included American Girl, Breakdown, Free Fallin', Learning to Fly and Refugee.
"He died peacefully at 20:40 Pacific time (03:40 GMT Tuesday) surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends," said his long-time manager Tony Dimitriades.
A statement on the singer's Twitter page described Petty's passing as an "untimely death".
Petty was also a co-founder of the Traveling Wilburys group in the late 1980s, touring with Bob Dylan, Roy Orbison, Jeff Lynne and George Harrison.
"It's shocking, crushing news," Dylan told theLos Angeles Times.
"I thought the world of Tom. He was a great performer, full of the light, a friend, and I'll never forget him."
Other tributes include those from fellow musicians Sir Paul McCartney, Carole King, Brian Wilson and Cyndi Lauper.
McCartney tweeted that he was"sending his love"to Petty and his family, whileKing said her "heart goes out"to "family, friends and fans of Tom Petty, of which I'm one".
Beach Boys star Brian Wilson tweeted that he was "heartbroken" to hear of the news.
Canadian singerBryan Adams thanked Petty"for all the great rockin' music".
Actor Kiefer Sutherland also paid tribute.
He tweeted: "Today America lost one of its musical giants. Thank you Tom Petty for all the music. To me you will live forever."
Petty also found solo success in 1989 with his album Full Moon Fever, which featured one of his most popular songs, Free Fallin', co-written with Jeff Lynne.
In 2002, Petty was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.
Petty was born in Gainesville, Florida, on 20 October, 1950.
He endured a rough childhood, living in poverty with an alcoholic, abusive father - but his life changed in 1961 when he met Elvis Presley and shook his hand.
"That was the end of doing anything other than music with my life," he said.
He joined two bands at school, The Sundowners and The Epics, before dropping out to play with Mudcrutch, aged 17.
After that band broke up, Petty and several of its members formed Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, releasing their debut album in 1976.
Their career was slow to take off, but heavy touring - including a well-received support slot with future E Street Band member Nils Lofgren in the UK - eventually pushed them into the chart.
Over the next four decades, they became one of rock's most reliable live acts, doggedly sticking to their no-frills rock template, and producing a stream of radio staples including Don't Come Around Here No More and the Stevie Nicks duet Stop Draggin' My Heart Around.
Petty scored solo hits with the platinum-selling albums Full Moon Fever and Wildflowers, while the 1991 album Into The Great Wide Open gave the band a number one single, Learning To Fly.
The video for the title track was also in constant rotation on MTV, thanks in no small part to cameos by Johnny Depp, Faye Dunaway and a then-unknown Matt LeBlanc.
Petty gave his last live shows just a week ago, playing three sold-out dates at the Hollywood Bowl as part of a 40th anniversary tour.
Last December,he told Rolling Stone magazine: "I'd be lying if I didn't say I was thinking this might be the last big one. We're all on the backside of our 60s.
"I have a granddaughter now I'd like to see as much as I can. I don't want to spend my life on the road."

The Additional Magistrate observed that he would make a suitable order regarding these requests after inspecting the facts pertaining to a Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ananda Samarasekara and his anticipatory bail application.
Meanwhile, the CID today tendered in Court information pertaining to the FR petition and anticipatory bail application filed by Prof. Ananda Samarasekara.

Bruce Willis is all set to return as John McClane in the next installment of Die Hard. The movie, a part-prequel, part-sequel, will be directed Len Wiseman, who confirmed the return of Willis.
Wisemans movie will be a parallel story featuring Willis in his iconic role as McClane in the present day and a new actor playing the vigilante during his younger years as a New York cop.
The right casting for this role is crucial. Those bare feet have some very big shoes to fill, Wiseman said. Wiseman previously directed the 2007 film Live Free or Die Hard.
Willis, who first appeared as McClane in 1988 hit, last played the role in 2013 movie A Good Day to Die Hard, which did not generate good reviews. The actor is also working on reviving another character. He is returning to M Night Shyamalans sequel to Unbreakable, which will reunite him with co-star Samuel L Jackson as they fight James McAvoys Beast from Split. The movie is titled Glass. PTI

Youre so beautiful, his voice intruded on her self-inspection, rought and with a depth of feeling that made it sound like a caress. A thousand fingers barely touching her skin, running down from the nape of her neck over every bump and groove of her spine to the small of her back, sending a delicious shiver through her.
Almost as soon as Devika Fernando could write, she imagined stories and poems. After finishing her education in Germany and returning to her roots in Sri Lanka, she got a chance to turn her passion into her profession. Having lived in Germany and in Sri Lanka with her husband has made her experience the best (and the worst) of two totally different worlds  something that influences her writing. Her trademark is writing sweet, yet deeply emotional romance stories where the characters actually fall in love instead of merely falling in lust. She draws inspiration from everyone and everything in life.
What she loves most about being an author is creating new worlds and sending her protagonists on a journey with ups and downs that leaves them changed. When shes not writing, shes reading or thinking about writing. Some of her contemporary and paranormal romance novels are bestsellers on Amazon.
Romance is not every novelists cup of tea. Most fiction-smiths toy with everything else that at times seems cerebral to the ordinary readership. Whether the literati like the idea or not, the romance genre hardly gathers dust. And in Sri Lanka, the genre is privileged with being sold like hotcakes.
Devika Fernando has captured that reality. She has written a number of romance novels and seems a maverick marketer on the cybersphere. And today, on social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook, she has earned quite an audience for her books.
We have oftentimes heard that the Sri Lankan English authors do not enjoy a flourishing market either at home or abroad. Fortunately, however, a few writers prove an exception to the rule. Shyam Selvadurai and Romesh Gunasekara are some of the Sri Lankan English authors who earned recognition on the global platform. But they are no longer domiciled in Sri Lanka.
No profits
Devika Fernando
Most Sri Lankan English authors thrive on their job with a handsome day job in hand, and they expect no profits in return.
I made it a point to start networking as soon as I knew I wanted to publish my first book. That involved connecting with other authors on Facebook and Twitter as well as following people who are avid readers, reviewers and bloggers. I made it a point to reach out to Indians because our neighbour seems to be a lot more open to and enthusiastic about literature in English. I also approached and interacted with Americans as they are the main customers of online stores like Amazon. Over time, I grew my friendship and readership circle to countries all around the globe. Its what I love about books: they bring people together, bridge gaps and form bondsespecially if theyre written in English, Fernando notes.
Sri Lanka could have a flourishing literature scene if we just encourage and sponsor the right people, especially the younger generation, Devika believes. Her story was different as she chose to self-publish all of her books and reach an international audience online. The internet has a way of removing geographical boundaries, the author adds.
Devika Fernando is also a German citizen despite her roots in Sri Lanka. Her novels are woven around various countries with Sri Lanka well included.
I admire the Sri Lankan English writers. I wish their contribution to this country and to literature, in general, was recognised more.
Many years ago, Devika discovered Michael Ondaatje. The Booker-acclaimed author paved the way for Devika to go in search of other writers. To date, The English Patient remains her favourite book. Although the other Sri Lankan English books are almost non-existent in bookstores abroad, Devika went in search of them in the Sri Lankan bookstores. That is how she familiarised the likes of Romesh Gunasekara, Shyam Selvadurai, Martin Wickramasinghe, Nihal de Silva, Ashok Ferrey and Jean Arasanayagam.
Tragic past
I saw the country through their eyes, its beauty and tragic past, its struggle and its exotic warmth. I truly believe they should receive more international recognition like various Indian authors do. Its encouraging to see emerging authors in the recent years, with their own voices and often also valuable contributions to competitions held for Commonwealth countries. I will have to check out Nayomi Munaweera, for example.
As she writes romance, love in its myriad forms always lies at the heart of her books. She finds it fascinating how people discover themselves and learn to love themselves when they fall in love with someone else. A journey of self-discovery, if you want to call it that, at times combined with a physical journey to a different place. Her books also shine a light on various issues like domestic abuse (When I See Your Face), arranged marriage (Saved in Sri Lanka) and life as a single parent (Kaleidoscope of Hopes). Family always plays a central role as well, either the lack of a familial bond or the complicated ways in which it can influence our life choices.
I find myself unable to write flawless or stereotypical characters or weak heroines who only swoon and simper. This isnt what women are like, so why portray them like this when there is such a wealth of traits, quirks and qualities to explore That being said, the chemistry of attraction and how it expresses itself is always a challenge and a treat to write. I make it a point not to restrict it to whatever may or may not happen between the sheets because romance is so much more than that.
Romantic suspense
Devika is fond of romance with its various sub-genres very much. In fact, she prefers contemporary romance because it resonates with a wide audience and can throw upas well as answerso many questions. Romantic suspense and paranormal romance are full of possibilities, too. They are a great canvas to paint on if you strive for developed, authentic characters and a more complex plot.
What measures could be taken to uplift the Sri Lankan English literature as a market-friendly entity
Devika brings out two main approaches. First, education needs to give literature a bigger place and greater value, especially contemporary literature in English. If you nurture a love for books in children, acknowledge and foster their talent, there are bound to be budding writers who could then go on to benefit from workshops and hone their skills. Events like the Colombo Book Fair and smaller events could be organised, with the main focus on English literature by national and international authors.
Or we could seek multinational promotions and team up with other Asian countries, hosting competitions and offering forums for discussion. And on the other hand, Sri Lankans should be familiarised with eBooks. So much here still depends on bookstores, printed copies and the huge cost that come with them.
These days, everyone knows how to use a phone and access the internet. Why not utilize that as a foundation to promote eBooks, get more people interested in reading and also make it easier for authors to publish or self-publish their works
