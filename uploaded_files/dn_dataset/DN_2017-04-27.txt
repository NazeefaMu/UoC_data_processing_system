CID or Bribery Comm. should probe into issuance of direct placement prior to 2015
Presidential Commission into Treasury Bond issue:
Former Deputy Governor Dr. W.A. Wijewardena said the CID or the Commission to Investigate on Bribery or Corruption should probe into the issuance of direct placement done prior to 2015 by the Central Bank's Public Debt Department.
He also proposed that a similar probe be done on the Employment Provident Fund as well.
Dr. Wijewardena said all CBSL officers are expected to submit their asset declarations to their Governor, where an investigative body could compare the real assets owned by the officers and what they had officially submitted, in order to ascertain whether there were any discrepancies, Dr. Wijewardena suggested.
He said if the Public Debt Department(PDD) had corrupt officials, the Central Bank should take immediate action against them, Dr. Wijewardena said.
He said, the Front Office officers of the Public Debt Department are allowed to change bond interest rates from five basis points. So there is the possibility of having bad eggs there, Dr. Wijewardena said. He also said there have been instances in the history of the CBSL where such officials were transferred. Dr. Wijewardena was replying to a question directed by Supreme Court Judge P. Jayawardena as to what was the procedure followed by the Public Debt Department when they placed direct placements with Primary Dealers.
Justice Jayawardena also questioned as to whether there had been any formal complaints regarding officials being biased towards certain primary dealers. Dr. Wijewardena replied that there were none. However, he said that rumours circulated in the market regarding such biased action, while the CBSL had probed into and taken necessary action.
Dr. Wijewardena also pointed out that CBSL officials of all ranks, were not even allowed to accept gift hampers from parties who transact with the Central Bank. They were expected to return such hampers to the Welfare Department of the Central Bank, he explained.
He also suggested that the
location of the Front office and the Back office of the PDD should be changed as well. Asked if he agreed to prohibit the usage of mobile phones within the PDD premises, Dr. Wijewardena answered in the affirmative.

Citizens' Mail
Rapid growth as a whole
We can be happy about the direction in which this country is steered. Sri Lanka is now geared for a better future, albeit a few setbacks.
Corruption is much discouraged thanks to the painstaking efforts of the two gentlemen in charge of the countrys highest echelons. That has led to radical development in certain sectors. However, a handful of opportunist politicians as well as sections of unscrupulous media showcase fraudulent propaganda to re-enthrone the former regime. They shed acid to innocent people's eyes by propagating all sorts of rumours.
The leaders of the former regime, instead of speaking in parliament or discussing directly with the present authorities, make a miserable attempt to win the common mans heart. They are not ashamed in passing the rein to the nose of the people thinking that they are foolish bulls or donkeys.

Colombo through to final in low scoring game
SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament:
Colombo led by Sri Lanka cricketer Dinesh Chandimal qualified for the final of the SLC Super Provincial 50-over tournament final when they beat table leaders Kandy by four wickets in a low scoring match played under lights at the R Premadasa Stadium yesterday.
Both teams played their final round robin matches. The other finalist will be decided after the outcome of todays match between Galle and Dambulla at the same venue under lights. Colombo who picked up a bonus points finished on top of the pile with 16 points. Kandy on 12 points has no chance of qualifying unless todays match ends in a no-result or a tie. In that event Kandy, along with Dambulla and Galle will all be tied on 12 points and the net run rate will come into play to decide the other finalist/
Currently Dambulla and Galle have 10 points each and the winner will qualify to play Colombo in the final on April 30 at the R Premadasa Stadium under lights.
Yesterdays match was quite in contrast to those played before it where high scores were the order of the day.
The two sides in yesterdays match could muster only 275 runs and last a total of 56.5 overs out of a maximum of 100. Kandy batting first were bundled out for 136 in 31 overs and Colombo used up 25.5 overs in knocking off the required runs scoring 139-6.
The highest individual score of the match was from Shehan Jayasuriya whose knock of 30 off 48 deliveries (2 fours) and his sixth wicket partnership of 68 off 85 balls with Sachitra Senanayake (22 not out off 9 balls, 3 fours, 1 six) sealed the match for Colombo after they were tottering at 47-5. Jayasuriya had earlier played the part of bowler capturing three wickets for 14 runs with his off-breaks to derail the Kandy batting.
Kandy were also badly placed at one stage at 96-9 before a last wicket partnership of 40 off 42 balls by Amila Aponso (22 n.o.) and Nuwan Pradeep (14) saw them to their final total which in the end proved insufficient to defend. Fast bowler Vishwa Fernando although going for plenty finished with figures of four wickets for 61 runs.
Scores: Kandy 136 in 31 overs (Mahela Udawatte 22, Amila Aponso 22 n.o., Vishwa Fernando 4/61, Shehan Jayasuriya 3/14, Wanidu Hasaranga 2/19)
Colombo 139-6 in 25.5 overs (Wanidu Hasaranga 29, Shehan Jayasuriya 30, Kithuruwan Vithanage 26, Sachitra Senanayake 22 n.o., Amila Aponso 2/34, Sachith Pathirana 2/35)

## Title: Cricket match fixing probe to be completed by end May
## Supertitle:

Cricket match fixing probe to be completed by end May
Delays due to several factors:
It is nearing three months since the appalling news first broke out about a Premier first-class match conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket being fixed. The two clubs concerned were Panadura Sports Club and Kalutara Physical and Cultural Club (KPCC) whose Premier League Tier B match played on January 23-25 at the Surrey Village grounds in Maggona stands accused of foul play.
The issue unfolded when Sri Lanka Ports Authority CC (SLPACC) who were one of the front runners for the title were deprived of winning it because of the rather unusual circumstances that led to Panadura winning the match outright by three wickets and thus emerging winners of Tier B. At the same time KPCC also benefited as they escaped relegation to a lower division by getting the required runs and points. As it turned out Panadura collected 17.84 points for their outright win and KPCC 5.49 points which was sufficient for them to avoid relegation.
KPCC in their first innings scored 390 off 103 overs at the rate of 3.78 runs per over and Panadura replied with 423 off 68.3 overs scoring at the rate of 6.17 runs per over. Where the real twist to the match took place was on the third and final day when KPCC was dismissed in their second innings for 197 off 22.5 overs scoring at 8.62 an over leaving Panadura with the target of 165 for a win. Panaduras run chase was extraordinary because they chased those runs down in a matter of just 13.4 overs scoring at a staggering rate of 12.21 runs per over.
Apart from the unbelievable run rates achieved there was also the mode of dismissals and the manner in which the overs were bowled that led to suspicion that the match was fixed for one team to emerge champions and gain promotion to a higher Tier and for other the team to avoid relegation.
SLC vice-president K Mathivanan who is overall in charge of domestic cricket said, Off nine consecutive balls they have scored four sixes and affected five dismissals. The run rate on the first day was 3.78 and on the last day it was 12.21. There was no doubt that so many overs had been bowled and there were nine stumpings on the last day with batsmen simply coming out of their crease and getting stumped.
Its a well known fact that something took place during the match but we have to establish the facts. Given fair justice it is obvious that the match has been fixed and the captain of the Panadura team didnt turn up for the match on the final day, said Mathivanan.
The lengthy period the inquiry has taken has raised doubts in certain quarters that the whole matter would be swept under the carpet as there are key officials of SLC who are members of the two accused clubs also involved.
This inquiry is not like the normal inquiries there are so many people involved - match referee, umpires and Ports Authority who made the complain, said Mathivanan.
The tournament committee had a preliminary inquiry where I was present and they felt that there is some evidence to probe into this match. They recommended me to go for an independent committee which I did having got the necessary approval from ExCo, he said.
Mathivanan explained the delay in concluding the investigation was due to many factors.
We appointed Chairman of the Disciplinary Committee Asela Rekawa, former national player Jayantha Paranathala and SLC head of Security and Investigations Sarathchandra Liyanage to form the three-member committee. Unfortunately Paranathala fell sick after one inquiry and we brought in Nalinda Illangakoon, a former brigadier from BRC into the independent committee, said Mathivanan.
They have already led the evidence of a representative from Ports Authority who had made the complaint. But the evidence given by him is not all that strong because he was not there at the match. He had only heard about it and they are the party who had been deprived of coming to the top of the table because of this match fixing allegation, he said.
Recently they had taken tournament committee chairman Bandula Dissanayakes evidence. There is something called natural justice, so we allowed the two accused parties to retain lawyers and cross examine the witnesses.Three lawyers are appearing on behalf of Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC. They cross examined Bandula on April 20. We dont want to leave room for the accused parties to go back to courts and say they were not given justice and this was a one-sided inquiry.
Mathivanan stated that the prosecution is being led by Uchitha Wickramasinghe, a lawyer and Ashley Ratnayake who is assisting him on cricket matters.
I know that there is a time period. Everyone has been hammering at us for delaying the final outcome. But I have been telling them that finally justice will be done and nobody can stop it, said a determined Mathivanan.
Firstly the complainant, then the tournament committee chairman, the umpire Gamini Dissanayake, match referee SM Faumi and then Asoka de Silva who has also been sent a letter have to be called up to give evidence. With that the inquiry will be over.
The last evidence we led was in the first week of April. There was a spate of holidays and we are resuming inquiries again on April 28. Next week they will have another 2-3 days. By another 6-7 sittings it will be completed. Seven sittings means 4-5 days and with Wesak intervening we are hoping to conclude it by end of May.
We cant get the witnesses to appear every day because they are also working and these inquiries are held in the evening and can go on for 3-4 hours, Mathivanan said.

CSC hits record Rs. 1.7 bn  turnover with coal transport
Ceylon Shipping Corporation (CSC), has successfully completed another season of transporting the much needed energy resource of the country by carrying nearly 2.209 million metric tonnes of Coal.
As the shipping arm to the procuring entity Lanka Coal Company (LCC), CSCs relentless task just completed few days back for the season 2016/2017 in transporting Ceylon Electricity Boards (CEB) annual coal requirement up to September 2017 through two-staged shipping process. During the said season, coal was carried from South Africas Richards Bay by using 37 shipments under the Contract of Affreightment entered on free-on-board basis with LCC through 26 time-chartered vessels and 11shipments by its own MV Ceylon Breeze and MV Ceylon Princess each weighing 63,000 metric tonnes.
Within a time span of six months, avoiding the rough sea season commonly known as Varakan, the transportation process is not an easy task to carry the countrys coal requirement that ensure energy security by thermal power production at Lak Vijaya Plant in Norochcholai, Puttalam.
As mentioned, the first leg of carriage involves the main sea voyage using the mother vessels that cover a passage of around 3600 nautical miles spending nearly 340 hours in smooth sailing at an average of 11 knots per hour from Richards Bay to Puttalam.
Once a ship arrives in the outer anchorage in the Puttalam coast, which is estimated at five nautical miles off the Jetty at Norochcholai, the coal is thereafter lightered using the cranes in the ship and carried up to the Jetty using Self Propelled Barges (SPB).
Since the draft at the coastline off Norochcholai is quite shallow, the particular process falls mandatory in carrying the coal to the conveyor belt that carry the cargo from the Jetty to the Plant. Since this complex procedure needs to be adopted, proper coordination in the due delivery of the cargo up to the receiving end of Ceylon Electricity Board is absolutely imperative.
In executing this said process, CSC has deployed a team of its staff with technical knowledge at the Jetty who perform at some higher expected levels.
During this season 2016/2017, CSC has secured total foreign exchange earnings and in return saving of nearly US$ 11.6 million for the countrys national economy through its own exercise, whereas such earning may have lost if an overseas supplier is vested with the task.
This would also ensure the strategic presence of a National Carrier for Sri Lanka that focus on developing a substantial fleet of ships, which is an important element in a countrys sustainable growth policy.
In addition, saving CSC owned vessels MV Ceylon Breeze and MV Ceylon Princess that have been bought by the previous regime at quite suspicious over-priced value has been highlighted as one of the critical decisions that the present Board is faced with. It is obvious that easing the debt burden imposed upon the CSC in relation to the purchase of these two vessels can only be marginalised by employing them in the coal transportation for the country on a service-for-reward basis.
It would not only strengthen the countrys national shipping sector but also to maintain a high degree of self-dependant sovereignty over its vessel owning capabilities in addition to the training of local seafarers.
Despite the present volatile market on freight rates, CSC has been able to provide these transportation services at a very competitive price by matching the suppliers CIF rate while safeguarding its existence through considerable profit making at operations.
Comparing to previous year; CSC was able to save over US$ 3 million in foreign exchange only from barging operations due to transparent selection of a suitable party to handle the lightering operation, namely United Shippers Limited (USL) that has helped increase the discharge rate of coal to the Jetty.

Dusky Mendis Special
Looking every inch like a West Indian mauler, dusky DULEEP MENDIS was hot property in the 1970s and 80s. His power packed dazzling magic electrified the field. With the willow he blundgeond bowlers local and international whether they be spin or pace with "Eveready Power and Swiss watch timing" that had spectators flocking to venues where he was in action to savour his magic. And rarely did he disappoint his schools St.Sebastians College Moratuwa or S.Thomas College, Mount Lavinia his team, club SSC, workplace Maharaja Organization or country. Runs flowed from his willow like the Mahaweli in spate. He was stockily built with a powerful muscular body and when he hit the ball it stayed hit. Any fielders daring to stop it did so at his own peril --- the risks included having damaged fingers or hands. The ball would race to the boundary boards or over it like a guided missile. I have played with and against him and could vouch for his power play.
MENDIS had all the shots in the book. Although short in stature, he could play the hook shot if the ball is reachable. After serving his term playing in the Sri Lanka team, the captaincy was not long in coming and when it did come he made it memorable one by leading the country to its first Test victory over India at the P. Sara Stadium.
First to score twin centuries
MENDIS was the first Sri Lankan batsman to score twin centuries and that was against India in Chepauk, Madras in 1982. He made the identical score of 105 in both innings. Mendis had the opportunity of scoring twin centuries at the Holy Land of cricket Lords in England. After making 111 in the first and when on 94 in the second innings, he had a sudden rush of blood and attempting to hoist Ian Botham for six dollied a catch. It was sad to see him go, but that is what the game is all about and that is why it is called at times game full of glorious uncertainties . MENDIS was lucky to survive a nasty incident in the 1975 World Cup in England when a vicious delivery from Australias pace merchant Jeff Thomson hit him on the head. It was a delivery pitched short of length which sprung cobra like to strike him. It was life threatening, but thank god he survived. That was the era when Thomson and Lillee were making batsmen shake in the knees with vicious fast bowling. Once MENDIS put aside his bat he took to coaching and was in charge of the national team at one time. It was when he was manager of the team that Sri Lanka won the 1995/96 World Cup in Lahore, Pakistan which sent the country into raptures. He was also Chief Executive of Sri Lanka Cricket under the chairmanship of Jayantha Dharmadasa for a short while and did a wonderful job using his tremendous experience in the game. His brother Gerald was also an excellent batsman and would have made it big time, but his job at Air Lanka did not allow him time to further concentrate on the game. Gerald was my team mate at Saracens Cricket Club.
Lot of leatner chasing
Mendis was a batsman opponents wanted out earlier. To let him ride was to do a lot of leather chasing while he reigned. An incident is still vivid in my memory. In the good old days the local cricket DERBY was the game between SSC and NCC. In an earlier article I had mentioned what a wonderful captain Michael Tissera was. And heres another instance to confirm that. In that game against SSC Tissera was captaining NCC. Now MENDIS had a weakness against the ball pitched short of a length and on leg stump level. When MENDIS walked out to bat he was given a rousing welcome by the SSC supporters who were awaiting a fireworks display from MENDIS. Tissera crowded MENDIS with an attacking field knowing that the youngster would be all nerves and positioning himself at silly mid on. Tissera got his pace bowler Vernon Caldera to pitch short of a length on leg stump. After a couple of deliveries Caldera pitched right , MENDIS poked his bat from the crease without moving his feet and the ball ballooned off MENDIS bat and Tisssera gobbled the catch to the joy of his team and disappointment of the SSC fans. MENDIS failed to score that was due to Tisseras astute and strategic captaincy. MENDIS had the ability to draw crowds where ever he played. At the wicket he was always excitement personified. I first saw him as a schoolboy cricketer at St.Sebastians when he made a scintillating half century against my old school St.Benedicts at Kotahena. After watching that knock I predicted a very bright future for him in the game and did he not oblige.
Successful batsman and captain
MENDIS after a successful run as batsman and captain at school he joined the school by the sea STCML and like the breeze by the sea, he continued his breezy batting also captaining the team and having the rare honour of captaining two schools. In the 1971 and 72 Royal-Thomian big games he scored centuries. In 71 he made an unbeaten 103 and in the next year put the Royal bowlers to the sword pulverizing and slamming a big 184. Another anecdote and it goes like this. Duleeps father was Julian and mother Doreen. Julian played for St.Sebastians College, Moratuwa and a team mate was the famous Acupuncturist Professor Anton Jayasuriya. Jayasuriya was a dear friend of mine. According to Jayasuriya who was the opening bowler while surveying the field before reaching his run up, he had noticed Duleeps father chatting to a lady on the fine leg boundary. Jayasuriya ran up and bowled a bouncer which the batsman mis-hooked and Duleeps father spilt the catch. Jayasuriya was furious. When the team reached the pavilion, Jayasuriya had slapped Duleeps father and chided him saying  you lost concentration and grassed the catch because you were chatting to a spectator. The offence brought a two match suspension on Jayasuriya. According to another dear friend of mine doctor J.C. Duraisingham who was a Director of Sport and a batch mate, Jayasuriya was known as kara at Medical College because he was always unafraid and unbowed and into trouble always with his hot temper.
But MENDIS --always delivered his type of Special. A 'Special' that cricketing connoisseurs would like to imbibe in for the thrill of all the blood rushing , adrenaline pumping excitement that he brought to the wicket.

England rising star Ansari retires
London: Surrey all-rounder Zafar Ansari unexpectedly announced his retirement from cricket at the age of 25 on Wednesday, just six months after making his England debut.
Ansari, who had been with Surrey since the age of eight, said he wanted to pursue other opportunities and was contemplating a career in law.
"After seven years as a professional cricketer and almost two decades in total playing the game, I have decided to bring my cricket career to an end," he said in a statement released by Surrey.
"This has been a very difficult decision to make and I have not made it lightly. It is... with great sadness that I say goodbye.
"Nevertheless, I have always been clear that when the time was right for me to move on I would, and that time has now come.
"While the timing may come as a surprise, I have always maintained that cricket was just one part of my life and that I have other ambitions that I want to fulfil.
"With that in mind, I am now exploring another career, potentially in law, and to achieve this I have to begin the process now."
Ansari was first capped by Surrey in 2014 and made his one-day debut for England the following year.
His Test debut was delayed by a freak hand injury sustained while fielding at Old Trafford in late 2015.
He eventually won his first Test cap against Bangladesh last October. Ansari has combined his cricket career with academic studies.
He secured a degree in Politics, Philosophy and Sociology from Cambridge University in 2013 and was awarded a Master's degree in History by Royal Holloway, University of London last year.
Alec Stewart, director of cricket at Surrey, said: "Zafar's exceptionally tough but considered decision is one that we should all respect and understand. AFP

ICC meeting: BCCI loses revenue, governance votes
Sri Lanka votes with India:
The Indian Cricket Board's hegemony in world cricket on Wednesday came under severe threat as the richest board was comprehensively out-voted on governance structure and revenue model at the ICC Board Meeting in Dubai.
India was checkmated by former BCCI boss Shashank Manohar, who now helms the ICC as its first independent chairman.
The BCCI was thrashed 1-9 when representatives of all other member nations, except India's Amitabh Chaudhary, voted in favour of a change in the governance structure.
Their opposition to change of the revenue model was also rejected 8-2 by the ICC board with Chaudhary only finding support from Sri Lanka Cricket's Thilanga Sumathipala.
The BCCI were opposing changes on two counts -- ICC's Governance model, which required a change in its constitution with review of full membership, and a two-tier Test structure.
The bigger issue was the contentious revenue model, which is set to bring India's share down to half from $570 million. Manohar has advocated a more equitable distribution from the earlier 'Big Three' Model where India, Australia and England were the primary earners.
"Yes, the votings are over. It was 8-2 in favour of revamped revenue model and 9-1 in favour of constitutional changes," a senior BCCI functionary present in Dubai told PTI on Wednesday.
"The BCCI has voted against both as we had, in principle, maintained that all these changes are completely unacceptable for us. At this point, we can only say that all options are open for us. We would have to go back to our SGM and apprise the members of the situation," he added.
It was learnt that since BCCI outrightly rejected the additional $100 million pay-out in revenue, it was once again given the original option of $290 million which is a $280 million cut from the $570 million India had been getting till last year.
A peeved senior official on Wednesday said that while it was expected that there will be resistance with current BCCI dispensation's bete noire Manohar at the helm, they were taken by surprise when Zimbabwe and Bangladesh -- the two votes that BCCI thought of as assured -- never came their way.
It is also a sort of embarrassment for the Committee of Administrators (COA) as it was dealing with a lot of member nations and was extremely confident of pulling it in India's favour.
The heavy defeat indicates that the COA failed to read the minds of the likes of Nazmul Hasan Papon, David Peever, Haroon Lorgat, all of whom came to India to discuss the changes.
"Zimbabwe have been promised $19 million by the ICC. On what grounds has Manohar made this promise But strangely Bangladesh also went the other way. Today at the meeting, Manohar, in fact, said that the $290 million is a 'take it or leave it' offer," the fuming BCCI official said.
"Now at the SGM, there were only two resolutions passed. Our representative had two mandates. Propose for deferment of the decision which was rejected. And the next option was voting against during a floor Test.
"Our aim was to protect India's interest. Our tone was extremely conciliatory at the meeting for the best interest of the game. But what was shocking was Mr Manohar's stance," the official claimed.  PTI

India miss Champions Trophy squad submission deadline
India have missed the April 25 deadline to submit their Champions Trophy squad to the ICC and it is understood the BCCI told the ICC that it could not submit the squad for "operational" reasons.
The other seven countries have all announced their squads.
According to a BCCI official, the delay was inevitable. With the BCCI secretary Amitabh Choudhury and CEO Rahul Johri attending the ICC meetings this week, and captain Virat Kohli playing the IPL, all concerned parties couldn't be in one place at the same time to pick the squad.
"We have told the ICC the reason behind the delay," the official said. "We have told them we will announce it soon."
However, the delay is being seen as a message from the BCCI to the ICC that it can still withdraw from the Champions Trophy should its demand to retain its share of revenue not be met. The ICC had earlier initiated reforms to undo the big-three revenue model, which could have brought the BCCI's share down from $570 million to $290 million.

Dengue has become an epidemic in Sri Lanka but not Influenza A (H1N1). Influenza A (H1N1) is not a public health issue in Sri Lanka, acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said.
Addressing a press conference at the Health Education Bureau in Colombo yesterday, he said since Influenza A (H1N1) is endemic and an ordinary seasonal disease, state health institutions do not keep track records on the disease. A majority of the infected are cured without any complications, Dr. Bandara said.
Allergies have been reported from the victims of the Meethotamulla tragedy but no other disease had been reported. Health authorities took immediate action to prevent diseases such as dengue, rat fever, etc. among the victims of the tragedy. Counseling services are also offered to them, Dr. Bandara said. The National Child Development Centre will be established at Mulleriyawa to assist children with autism. Child development centres will be set up in every province for the same purpose. Artistes, journalists, sportsmen and women can help children who suffer from autism to change their lives, he added.

## Title: Japanese ERS solution  for rapid waste composting

Japanese ERS solution  for rapid waste composting
A paper submitted by the Research Centre for Social Sciences (RCSS) of the Faculty of Social Sciences of the Kelaniya University by Dr Hemantha Premaratne (Kotelawala Defence Academy) Dr.M.G. Kularatne (Kelaniya University), Jude Fernando (Consultant) and Ranjan Joseph (COSTI).
For a long time, decent treatment for municipal and industrial waste and garbage has become an acute public issue in many countries. Environmental pollution, diseases, financial and economic costs are associated with mismanagement of waste.
It is essential to have an integrated waste management system to address this issue in total, as there is no one single solution. The principles of 3R (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle), segregation at the source and waste generator and public participation in the waste management process are mandatory in a successful waste management strategy. If properly managed, waste will become a valuable resource that creates employment opportunities, raw material for industries, energy and most importantly, organic fertilizer for agriculture.
The most visible problem of mismanaged waste generally arises from organic or perishable matter. Therefore, it is imperative to initially generate an effective solution to manage the organic component which is over 40 percent of the total waste, in order to find the total solution.
It is also understood that relevant agencies established in Sri Lanka for waste management have implemented number of programmes to manage the organic component of MSW, yet unfortunately failed due to such reasons as inappropriate technology, lack of continuity, resistance and vested interests from stakeholders, etc. The classic example is Pillisaru Purawara programme in which investment over Rs 5 bn has been dematerialised with no accountability.
Issues of MSW in Sri Lanka
Approximately 50% percent of Sri Lankan MSW is said to be organic matter which is rich in plant nutrients, once composted. Alternative technologies to composting such as land filling has become one of the biggest problems in the country due to a higher rate of waste generation by public and industry, land unavailability, public protest, fast rate of urbanization and environmental pollution. The other technologies such as waste to energy and anaerobic digestion seem to have a higher opportunity costs beyond the reach of the state unless the investment is sponsored by another actor.
Another main argument which states that compost generated from MSW is contaminated with heavy metals such as lead, cadmium and arsenic can be nullified if , a proper mechanism such as 3R (Reduce, Reuse and Recycle), sorting at source, Material Recovery Facility (MRF) or manual sorting at the gate is implemented. The classic examples are abundant, but a selected few in the world are Edmonton's Composting Facility in Canada, Keppel Seghers Facility in Qatar and Lahore Composting Facility in Pakistan.
2.2 Alternative Solutions
Among the handful of solutions, composting seems to be the most viable and economically feasible. There are three main types of aerobic composting currently available for MSW management in Sri Lanka. Windrow composting which is widely practiced in Sri Lanka takes 6-10 weeks, occupies vast space, cause environmental damage, has labour issues and results in poor quality compost.
The Kawashima composting which is currently practiced as a pilot project in Digana Kandy, has its own setbacks in the Sri Lankan context. It takes nearly eight weeks against the initial plan of two weeks for the process, occupies a large area, has a high operational cost and the possibility to allow pathogens and weed seeds to remain in the end product.
The third technique which is not currently available in Sri Lanka, the Japanese Rapid Composting technology (ERS),is a high-speed, aerobic composting and drying system which converts waste to value-added products such as organic fertilizer, animal feed and even raw materials for biomass power generation.
This ERS technology takes only 24hours compared to 6-10 weeks taken by other methods. The main ingredient of this system is a patented combination of microbes, when found from local soils, is a highly efficient and 100 percent environmental friendly Japanese technology. The investment of this system is almost equal to that of the Kawashima method and a municipality can run an ERS system as a profitable income earning venture.
Furthermore, ERS is a Bio-Mechanical Technique (BMT)and microbes are multiplied and stored in an ERS reactor. The reactor uses a pressure and temperature controlled environment to create an ideal condition for aerobic microbes to multiply exponentially, thereby decomposing the organic matter and evaporating the moisture in just 24 hours. Water content will be recovered by the heat exchange and used back in the system in the cooling tower.
No odours and effluents are released and energy costs are kept low by the recycling of the heat generated in fermentation.
This technology has been applied in many countries, particularly in Japan, China, Philippines, Malaysia, Singapore and Indonesia and is found to be a lasting and most efficient solution for MSW management.
3. Japanese Rapid Composting ERS Technology
3.1 ERS Process Floor
Waste is first inserted to the hopper which then transfers it automatically to the main unit of ERS where the fermentation and drying process takes place. The output is segregated as degradable and non-degradable, while non-degradable remains are used as fuel for the biomass boiler. Water content will be recovered by the heat exchange and is reused in the system in the cooling tower. No odour is released and energy costs are kept at bay by recycling the fermented heat.

Figure 01:
ERS process flow (Fertilizer, Animal Feed and Energy)
3.2 Key Features of ERS System/Functionality
* The largest ERS system requires only four perches which is far less than the number of hectares used for a conventional system.
* ERS system is independent of weather and can operate anywhere in Sri Lanka.
* It can be used for solid, liquid or animal/ fish/ slaughterhouse/ sewage/ human waste.
* No micro-organisms or bacteria are brought from abroad. The usage of local microbes in particular, guarantees that recycled waste matches the conditions of the surrounding area.
* No need to replace or refill the microbes and no additional cost is involved.
* ERS has patent rights to use three types of specific microbes named Simose1,Simose 2 and Simose 3 in combination.
* The process is largely automated. Only the input and the output are manually handled.
* The ERS system operates for 24 hours and 360 days. Motors need to be changed once every 7 years. The vacuum pumps, cooling water pump, and vacuum valve need replacement when they are exhausted. Running maintenance is possible and the cycle continues after repair.
* Part feeding is allowed. Waste collected from areas close by the plant can be fed into the hopper with quantities as low as 50 kgs per cycle while maintaining the total capacity for 24 hours. No storage of raw waste and associated problems.
3.3 ERS System Capacity and Scalability
ERS comes in different capacities (Table 1)such as, ERS-0, ERS-1, ERS-2, ERS-3, ERS-4, ERS-5, ERS 6 and 7 and ERS-8 according to the input. Thus, it can be contextualised according to the district or area depending on the amount of waste disposed by each district.
For example, in urban towns such as Kandy, Colombo and Gampaha where there is a high amount of garbage disposal, ERS 5,6 and 7 or 8 could be used while for rural, less populated areas, ERS 0,1 or 2 could be used.
It is also possible to scale down on certain subsystems of ERS in order to save initial investment costs depending on the user requirement. Apart from that, ERS also allows the selection of operating times as 12 hours or 24 hours according to the requirement.
4. Why is ERS the best alternative waste management system for Sri Lanka
The financial provisions for the Pilisaru project was expected to be to the tune of Rs 5.675 billion which was mainly invested in composting of MSW/ Waste at various level using the Windrow method.
However, it has ended up without achieving its objectives (refer, issues and solutions on waste management in Sri Lanka by Research Centre for Social Sciences (RCSS) and the Department of Geography of Faculty of Social Sciences of University of Kelaniya). Reports identify that most of the Pilisaru projects established around the country are inefficient because of the following reasons:

i. The existing compost production process requires a long period of time.
ii. Compost production is not an eco-friendly process.
iii. Compost users are not satisfied with the output and do not trust the quality of compost.
iv. Labour shortage for segregation of solid waste.
v. Wet climate affecting negatively for compost production.
vi. Paying attention only to produce compost
vii. Land area needed for compost production cannot be allocated for local authorities.
viii. Due attention for Pilisaru projects is not received from political leaders and respective authorities.
ix. Neglecting the residuals that are produced from the compost production process
x. Labourers and other employees are not satisfied with the benefits they get including the salary.
The Kawashima technique is another composting solution that has been proposed with the patronage of JAICA. A pilot plant was established in the Digana Kundasale area, with an approximate investment of Rs 120 mn, with a capacity of processing 25 MT per day. However, the investment is now expected to be increased to Rs 160 to 200 mn as per the information from relevant authorities.
Further, an initial estimate of a two-week composting cycle has now extended to 6 to 8 weeks. The drawbacks stated in the RCSS with regard to the Pilisaru Project are more or less present in the Kawashima method. Under such uncertainty there are plans to set up eight more Kawashima plants in various locations in the country, which will also end up disastrously.
The report presented by the RCSS recommends Rapid Composting (ERS) as The Solution for management of organic MSW due to the following reasons;
i. The main reason is that the efficiency of ERS outperforms all other composting and non composting technologies presently available in the world. ERS is essentially a large scale technology solution, which is 50 times more efficient than Windrow and Kawashima.
ii. ERS targets effective manufacturing of organic compost as well as animal feed and fuel for biomass power generation.
iii. ERS does not demand pre-segregation of organic and inorganic materials to a greater extent.
iv. ERS is functional irrespective of any weather condition.
v. ERS can be utilized for both solid waste and liquid waste.
vi. ERS has an automatic control system that requires less man power.
vii. ERS requires a lesser area of land.
viii. ERS is less time consuming.
ix. ERS is eco-friendly.
Apart from its technical, social and environmental feasibility, ERS has a great financial viability to run as a commercial venture. Local government authorities can run ERS plants independent of government financial support as income generating venture with low interest loans provided through the Local Loans and Development Fund of the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government.
With minimum assistance from the state and with a low interest loan, there are opportunities for the private sector to come forward to establish Private Public Partnerships for the management of MSW.
As such, the Government of Sri Lanka, Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government and the other relevant stakeholders shall come forward to implement the ERS system.

JO slams decision to remove Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as Dambulla party organizer
The Joint Opposition yesterday, slammed the decision taken by the SLFP to remove Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as the Partys organizer for the Dambulla electorate.
MP Dullas Alahapperuma speaking to the media in Colombo, said that Tennekoon as a senior Vice President of the SLFP had done yeomen service to the Partys progress over the years.
Alahapperuma while noting that the removal of party stalwarts such as Tennekoon, would hurt the SLFP in the long run as compared to the
incident where the sacking of the
SLFP and UPFA General Secretaries 72 hours prior to the August 18 General election.
Alahapperuma also charged that those who had replaced Tennekoon and several other SLFP seniors removed in recent times as electoral organizers, were incompetent and unpopular.
He went on to say that sacking of party seniors from posts of electoral organizers, would help to bring in more crowds to the JOs May Day rally at Galle Face.

Legends admire Mother of All Shows
The race for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year has taken a new turn with dark horses making their presence felt in the last few weeks of voting. That gives an indication that there could be a few more sensational changes as heavy voting is expected in the coming years.
Santhush Gunatileka of St.Peters College, Colombo made a steady progress by advancing to the number two position in the division1 contest. He displaced Sanjula Abeywickrema of Isipataana to the third position. Hence, the division 1 contest has now turned out to be a three cornered tussle among Petetrites Lakshina Rodrigo and Santhush Gunatileka and Sanjula Abeywickrema of Isipathana at the end of the 9th week count.
However, Piyumal Sinhawansa of St.Annes College, Kurunegala and Charitha Basnayake of Bandarawela Central College maintained their leads in the division 11 and division 111 contests for the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year titles respectively.
Winning a major title at the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year mega show has been the dream of every schoolboy cricketer. Such title would definitely take them much closer to a place in the national pool, considering the past track records of the proud recipients of the prestegious title.
Meanwhile, some of the top international cricketers produced by Sri Lanka, all top award winners of yesteryear, have commended the role played by the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest to promote school cricket during the past four decades.
In their recent interviews on Sri Lankas first-ever inter-school cricket awards ceremony, many top Sri Lanka cricketers have hailed the role played by the Lake House and the Sunday Observer in fostering school cricket.
Although the countrys inter-school cricket history is around one-and-a-half century old, there had not been any formal award ceremony to appreciate the achievements of schoolboy cricketers until 1979. But the countrys flagship English newspaper then understood the need to appreciate the achievements of schoolboy cricketers and inspire them.
As a result, the inaugural Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards ceremony was held at Navarangahala in 1979. It was a memorable start with the then Royal captain Ranjan Madugalle being adjudged the first-ever recipient of the prestigious Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title.
Chief ICC Match Referee and former Sri Lanka captain Ranjan Madugalle has paid a tribute to the Lake House and the Sunday Observer for keeping the show going for all these years. Sponsors are essential to keep the show going. In the past, most of the winners of the top awards came from Colombo and its suburbs, but now, the outstation schools have come in a big way and it is a positive sign for the game. May the show continue for many years to come. Says Madugalle/
Minister of Ports and Sri Lankas world cup-winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga said that it is the dream of any schoolboy cricketer to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. Its great for the Sunday Observer to conduct the Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest since 1979 to encourage the budding schoolboy cricketers. I was particularly happy to see that the Northern Province joining with the others in the competitions at the contest. I am happy at the improvement of outstation cricket as the game has spread far and wide in the country. Many Sri Lankan cricketing giants of the past and the present are those who have either won the prestigious and coveted Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Award or won other awards at the contest, said Ranatunga who had won the title on two occasions.
ICC Elite Panel Umpire and former Sri Lanka cricketer Kumar Dharmasena feels that winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was one of the greatest moments in his career as a cricketer. Winning the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration. That helped and encouraged me to play for Sri Lanka. Winning such a mega award gives a huge image and confidence to a schoolboy cricketer to go places. We were determined to reach the top of the ladder and did so with dedication, he said/
If you dont enjoy the game and dedicate yourself towards it, you wont be successful. Believe in yourself, work hard with dedication and you will find success, Dharmaasena added.
Former Sri Lanka cricketer and present Sri Lanka team manager Asanka Gurusinha too proudly admires the glittering Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title he had won when he was playing for Nalanda. When Roshan Mahnama won this award twice in 1983 and 1984, I felt how prestigious it is to win the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award. It is not an award that everybody could win. One has to perform exceptionally well and be consistent right throughout a season to win that  work really hard to reach the pinnacle of school career, he said.
The Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show has not only produced top cricketers but some international level umpires such as Kumar Dharmasena who serves in the ICC elite panel. I am glad that the Lake House is hosting the awards show uninterrupted and encouraging the budding schoolboy cricketers. During my time, this was the only school cricket awards show and we were eagerly looking forward to it, Gurusinha added.
Former Sri Lanka captain and ex-Sri Lanka national coach Marvan Atapattu too feels that the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title was a big inspiration to his cricket career. I was a student at Ananda then, playing my junior cricket when I witnessed the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year awards show in 1982. There I saw our school captain at that time Arjuna Ranatunga emerging out of a huge cricket ball, erected on stage, to receive the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year award, says Atapattu.
That was a great inspiration to me and I thought that I too could make my family, the team and my school proud if I could win that top award one fine day. The things worked well for me to emulate that feat eight years later, he was quoted as saying.
Almost all those who have won top awards at Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year show have stepped into the national team in next to no time and many of them have established their mark as top national players.

May day; stirring dismay!
With May Day looming, political parties are making last minute preparations to put on a show- and vying with each other to draw the biggest crowds, so they could engage in one-upmanship with each other.
The ruling United National Party (UNP) will hold its rally at Campbell Park in Colombo but the main focus of attention will be the tug-of-war between the two factions of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP)- and the warning shots in this battle appear to have been fired already.
The mainstream SLFP, led by President Maithripala Sirisena, will gather at Getambe in Kandy. The hill capital is a stronghold of the UNP, but being away from the main political events in Colombo, the SLFPs organisers are confident of attracting a large gathering to demonstrate its political strength.
The Joint Opposition (JO) where former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is the de-facto leader will hold its rally at Galle Face Green. Previously, this has been a venue preferred by ruling parties. President Sirisena, at a meeting with media heads last week, indicated that it was his decision to provide the prime location for the JO.
Earlier, media reported that Prime Minister Wickremesinghe had instructed Police to facilitate security for the JO and for Rajapaksa in particular, at the venue. At the time, some suggested that the decision to provide the Galle Face Green to the JO was a ploy to expose its lack of support as they claimed the JO would not have the strength to muster a crowd that was large enough to fill the venue. Rajapaksa too was asked about this and replied confidently: Come to Galle Face and see!
May Day celebrations
However, the tussle for supremacy between the two factions of the SLFP was evident, days before the May Day celebrations, with President Maithripala Sirisena taking action to remove two SLFP organisers in the Kandy and Matale districts.
On Tuesday, former minister and SLFP senior vice president Janaka Bandara Tennakoon and parliamentarian Lohan Ratwatte were sacked from their posts of electoral organisers by President Sirisena. Janaka Bandara Tennakoon was the electoral organiser of Dambulla while Lohan Ratwatte was electoral organiser of Pathadumbara. They were replaced by Dambulla Trade Union leader U.R. Dayanandasiri and Provincial councillor W.M. Yasamanna respectively.
Incidentally both Tennakoon and Ratwatte have strong family ties with the SLFP. Tennakoon is the son of T. B. Tennakoon a colourful and controversial character who held the portfolios of Social Services and Cultural Affairs in the Cabinet of Sirima Bandaranaike from 1970 to 1977. Having entered Parliament as an SLFP member in 1956 he remained undefeated until 1977 when he was ousted by the UNPs landslide win that year.
Lohan Ratwatte is the son of Anuruddha Ratwatte who was Minister of Power and Energy and also held the powerful position of Deputy Defence Minister in Chandrika Kumaratungas Cabinet. Ratwatte (Snr) was also a cousin of Sirima Bandaranaike and, during the Kumaratunga years, spearheaded the militarys battle against the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE).
Both Janaka Bandara Tennakoon and Lohan Ratwatte have been controversial characters, albeit for different reasons. At the outset of the last presidential election campaign, on the day the then General Secretary of the SLFP, Maithripala Sirisena announced that he would be the common candidate of the opposition, Tennakoon made a controversial speech in Parliament saying the party had been taken hostage by drug-dealers and those who import ethanol. He said the traditional SLFP old guard had become helpless.
As a result, his name was also mentioned in media reports as a ruling party member who might cross over to the opposition ahead of the presidential election. That however, did not eventuate. After the election though, he did pledge his loyalty to President Sirisena, accepting the post of Minister of Provincial Councils and Regional Development in March 2015.
Rajapaksas camp
Yet, Tennakoons stint as a Cabinet minister was short-lived. In July, Tennakoon tendered his resignation in protest against President Sirisenas nationally televised remarks that Rajapaksa would not be appointed Prime Minister, even if the SLFP emerged as the single largest party at the August 2015 general election.
In contrast, Ratwatte is controversial for different reasons. Having acquired a reputation as a politician who does not hesitate to use strong arm tactics, he was implicated in the shooting death of Papua New Guinean Rugby player Joel Pera twenty years ago on May Day in 1997 but was subsequently released due to lack of evidence. Four year later, in 2001, during elections, Ratwatte was implicated in the shooting deaths of ten Sri Lanka Muslim Congress supporters. He was again exonerated by courts due to lack of evidence.
It is no secret that both Tennakoon and Ratwatte are now firmly aligned with the JO and have hitched their wagon to Rajapaksa. Their dismissal from their electoral organiser posts will push them towards Rajapaksas camp even more.
At the ceremony to hand over new electoral organiser positions, a few ministers were at hand. Among them were S.B. Dissanayake, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Mahinda Amaraweera. Observers say that Minister de Silva let the cat out of the bag when he said he hoped the newly appointed organisers would work towards forming a SLFP government in 2020.
It was only two weeks ago that the President moved to quell discontent in the Kurunegala district by reshuffling the organisers there. Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekera was appointed as the SLFP organiser for the Panduwasnuwara electorate after he insisted on being reinstated there. In a related reshuffle, Dharmasiri Dasanayake was appointed as the organiser for the Bingiriya electorate, Jayarathne Herath for the Polgahawela electorate and Lakshman Wandaruwa for the Kurunegala electorate.
Jayasekera, a former UNPer, was previously a Rajapaksa loyalist, supporting the former President during the presidential election campaign and hurling insulting remarks at candidate Sirisena. Now however he has had a change of heart and is firmly with the President.
The Presidents move to appoint new organisers, with only a week to go for May Day, appears to be a strategic move to isolate the JO. The President is in firm control of the mainstream SLFP because he commands a majority of the partys decision making body, the Central Committee, even if he does not command the support of a majority of parliamentarians elected under the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) banner. As such, nominations from the SLFP at a future election will be definitely under the Presidents direction.
The underlying message therefore is that those who wish to align themselves with the JO and the Rajapaksa camp will need to seek nominations from another source. The JO itself is preparing for this eventuality, propping up the Sri Lanka Podujana Pakshaya (SLPP).
2015 election
In fact, at the JOs May Day rally, the role of the SLFP and its traditional hand symbol is likely to be deliberately understated and the SLPP maybe unveiled to the public. However it is no secret that the SLFP and the hand symbol are potent factors which attracts a strong voter base. To what extent a fledgling party, even with Mahinda Rajapaksa leading it, can erode the SLFPs hard core vote base remains to be seen.
There are also rumblings of dissent within the JO that the SLPP project has been taken over by former Minister Basil Rajapaksa. The younger Rajapaksa, the omnipotent Minister of Economic Affairs in the Mahinda Rajapaksa government, was much maligned in the aftermath of the 2015 election defeats and left the country.
Now he has returned and is fashioning the formation of the SLPP. Many SLFP seniors who attribute Mahinda Rajapaksas defeat to younger brother Basils actions are apprehensive that they would be sidelined- yet again. Some are promoting Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as a more credible alternative and others are proposing Dinesh Gunawardena for a leadership role.
It is not that the UNP does not have its issues. Recent moves to appoint several deputy leaders for the party have been put on hold- at least until May Day- but the difficulties the UNP leadership has pale into insignificance in comparison to the travails of the SLFP.

Minister pandering to SAITM: GMOA
Three ministers were pandering on behalf of SAITM during the television programme telecast yesterday. The Health Minister lied during the programme, Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) Secretary, Dr. Navin De Zoysa said.
Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said everything presented during the television programme was just information that is not based on any facts and figures.The truth is that the Colombo Medical Faculty is in the 2000th place in world rankings while SAITM is in 14,000th place according to statistics.
According to Dr. Zoysa, the three ministers presented different facts during the television programme and lied to the judiciary by presenting inaccurate, distorted facts. They clearly stood for SAITM and not for State Medical Faculties. "In addition, now they have taken over the official duties of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) and are making decisions that should be made by the SLMC based on technical facts," he said.
The GMOA will never stop its struggle against SAITM until the Government takes it over and declares it as public property. What the Government should do now is to implement the set of proposals presented to the Government a month ago by the GMOA, Deans of all State Medical Faculties of Sri Lanka and the Faculty of Medicine Teachers' Associations (FMTAs), he added.

Minister Senasinghe at Harvard : Sri Lanka should develop export oriented sectors
Sri Lanka needs to look at new sectors which will generate higher export value. This is an area where Harvard University is collaborating with the country, International Trade State Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said.
The State Minister was addressing the GEM 2017 Forum at Harvard Universitys Kennedy School on Sri Lankas experience with economic development  tailoring solutions to local problems recently.
He said a reason for the Sri Lankan conflict was the adoption of Sinhala as the sole language of the country, which resulted in the alienation of the Tamil community, culminating in insurgency and terrorism. The 30-year conflict damaged Sri Lanka in term of economy and international image.
Senasinghe said nine leading political figures were assassinated in the conflict period including President Premadasa. However, Sri Lanka defeated the terrorist group, he said.
State Minister Senasinghe said military experts speak of the Sri Lankan model of counter insurgency.
He said the country benefits from a central position in a region which is not just emerging as an economic powerhouse, but also represents a demographic block of 5 billion people with whom Sri Lankas small economy can interact through trade and investment.
He said an important challenge faced by the Sri Lanka economy is its reliance on the apparel industry for exports. He said the industry though significant, has not grown as fast as, for example, that of Bangladesh.
The State Minister said another important aspect of Sri Lanka is the strengthening of democratic institutions and economic liberalisation. Senasinghe said these two are linked and Sri Lanka aims to strengthen business ranking and has set up nine commissions that will result in the strengthening of institutions and democracy.
He said there is a realisation on the part of the government of the need to strengthen global supply chains in the future as the Sri Lankan economy is tied to the global market.
He said the countrys three leading ports at Hambantota, Trincomalee and Colombo will play a vital role, being deep harbours. Sri Lanka will become a major transshipment center.
The State Minister said the country enjoys considerable goodwill on the part of regional powers such as China who are engaged in the development of an industrial zone in Hambantota, while other countries are looking at new zones in Kalutara and Kurunegala.
There is also a need to appreciate the fact that many changes are taking place in the region with Chinese Government promoting the One Belt One Road strategy initiative to link China to Asia, the Middle East and Europe in a modern day silk road.
He said Sri Lanka is looking at strengthening trade agreements with China and India which will help strengthen the governments goal to create a trading hub in the country.
The country will need to upgrade infrastructure and will be linked by a network of modern expressways which will reduce time of travel in the Island, he said.

Monetary Board, CB responsible for loss by Treasury Bond issuance
The Monetary Board and the Central Bank of Sri Lanka should be held responsible for the loss incurred by the questioned issuance of 30-year Treasury Bonds in 2015, retired former Deputy Governor Dr. W. A. Wijewardena said yesterday.
It was also insisted that the position is his personal opinion only. Former DG Wijewardena said according to his calculations, the immediate loss due to the questioned transaction is Rs.532 million and the long term loss would run up to Rs.10 billion.
Dr. Wijewardena pointed out to the Commission that the CBSL officers who testified before the Pitipana Commission, have been of the viewpoint that there have been no loss incurred by the questioned treasury bond issuance.
Dr.Wijewardena also said the decisions to do away with the 5% interest rate provided for commercial banks and to accept 10.5 billion through 30 year bonds, resulted in all the structures of interest rates having gone high.
He said every officer in the CBSL is fully qualified in their education and professional expertise, so that they are responsible to notify regarding a discrepancy as all of them are expected to exercise due diligence . If someone is to rob our workplace, we cannot ignore the attempt saying it is the responsibility of the security service, Wijewardena emphasised .
Dr. Wijewardena was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue. Apart from being a senior Central Banker and as the longest served Deputy Governor of the Central Bank, Dr.Wijewardena has been the expert advisor to the Gamini Pitipana Committee and the first COPE subcommittee chaired by D.E.W. Gunasekara that probed into the Treasury Bond issue.
Dr.Wijewardena also said the Treasury Bond Tender Board is also responsible for the loss incurred by the issuance of 30 year Treasury Bonds on February 27, 2015. He said the Tender Board should have referred this to the Finance Ministry Secretary regarding its position.
Asked if there is a culturally reverential acceptance of a Governors decision, Dr.Wijewardane answered in the affirmative. The Governor has enormous power within the CBSL. When a Governor walks into a meeting, the officers can be under pressure .The officers will yield to what the Governor says, he said.
In my long career, there were two Deputy Governors detached from their positions due to going against the Governors decision, he explained.
It was observed at the Commission, if that would be the culture within the CBSL, would any officer or committee go against the former Governors decision as well.
Former DG Wijewardena also said that he believes former Governor Arjun Mahendran is also responsible for failing to obtain the approval from the Monetary Board on suspending the direct placement method. Former Governor Mahendran should have properly given the rationale behind making such a decision.
Doing away with the direct placement method is not within the purview of the Governor, Dr. Wijewardena further said. He also said the direct placement method is an artificial manipulation of the interest rates, which is not conducive to an economy in the long run.
Dr. Wijewardena also said that the stoppage of direct placement method should have been one of gradual stoppage. When it was abruptly stopped, the market is at a shock, he explained. He also said in an auction dominated hybrid system, the direct placement method should be used as a control measure.
He pointed out the Treasury Bond auctions that took place in March 2016, gives a fine example as to how the CBSL was at the mercy of Primary Dealers.

A multi-purpose transport centre will be built in Kandy at a cost of Rs 6,000 million under the Kandy City Development programme by amalgamating the Goods Shed Bus Stand and the Kandy Railway station, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawake said.
Addressing a press conference at the Riverdale hotel Kandy, the Minister said tenders will be called before the end of this year for the construction of this electronically operated centre which will be similar to the working of the airport.
Multi-purpose transport centres have been proposed for Pettah, Kottawa and Battaramulla and Galle, but the proposed centre in Kandy will be given preference. He said Kandy, Jaffna and Galle would be developed as strategic cities under foreign aid. During the second stage, such cities would be developed in Anuradhapura, Trincomalee and Hambantota. All strategic towns would later be linked together under the governments proposed plan. Although strategic town concept was not popular it was far better than beautification programmes undertaken in cities by building parks and roundabouts.
He said almost 40 percent work on the Colombo Financial City programme has been completed. Preference would be given to solve the vehicle congestion in Kandy, Minister Ranawake said.

National Vesak Festival in Kegalle as Sri Lanka hosts International Vesak Day in kandy and colombo
The countrys National Vesak Festival will be held in the Kegalle District. The government has imparted nearly Rs.1,000 million for the organisation of the festival and related development activities.
President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe are due to open the National Vesak Festival on March 10.
We are proud to have the official National Vesak festival in our historic district, which is the region of the Satara Koralaya of Maya Rata, Kegalle District Leader of UNP and Enterprises Development Minister Kabir Hashim said Monday at a press conference at his ministry.
We see this as a boon bestowed on us to improve the regions infrastructure and facilities in parallel with the arrangements to hold the festival, he said.
He said The Buddhas teachings are not restricted to any particular nation or any ethnicity.The Buddhist doctrine teaches us to spread our love and compassion to animals. The noble teachings of the Buddha are for whole of mankind. It teaches us to how we may live to the fullest without any affliction from pain and sorrowfulness.
When the topic is on celebration of Vesak, our thoughts naturally flow over to the Kelaniya Raja Maha Vihara, the minister said and added,Although the Kelaniya Raja Maha is regarded or so named as the main place for celebrating Buddhist events, we believe that Wattarama Rajamaha Vihara in Kegalle, where one of the Detis Palaruwa Bodhi Tree branches is located and Sri Lankas last known Arahath Wanaguptha Maliyadewa Maha Thera had lived, can also be regarded as having similar importance for holding important Buddhist events.
In view of Vesak celebrations at Wattarama Rajamaha Vihara this year,a large number of Smaneras will be ordained to the the Maha Sangha.The government will provide patronage to the ordination ceremonies, Hashim said.
He said when the historic Wattarama temple was donated to the order of Buddhst monks by King Sirisangabos brother King Gotabhaya, it was done so by ordaining 12 000 laymen into the order.
Therefore,I think the decision by the government to hold the festival in Kegalle is of great significance, said Hashim.
We have set out plans to celebrate the festival while ensuring the participation of both Buddhist and non-Buddhist public.
He said after their ascent to power in 2016, he and Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya requested at a Cabinet meeting that holding of the National Vesak Festival be given to the Kegalla district. As there had been problems as regards availability of certain infrastructure facilities in the district, the festival was destined to go to the Hambathota district that year, he said.
He said Minister Siyambalapitiya and he made the same request in 2017 and President Maithripala Sirisena approved it .
Commenting on the work they have carried out, Hashim said,to give due place for Buddhism and to invigorate Buddhist activities during Vesak, we took steps with the Ministry of Buddha Shasana to upgrade the Wattarama Raja Maha Vihara temple.
The infrastructure around the temple too have been developed side by side with the program. Main access roads and village roads have been improved, he said. .
The government has put millions to the activities.The Ministry of Highways has invested money to build a car park for the temple so that those patronizing the temple can use it.
Actions are being taken to provide pipe borne water to many areas in the Kegalla district as part of the program, he said.
Power and Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya has done much to improve electricity in the district, he said.
There are 669 Buddhist temples in the Kegalle district with 40 Raja Maha Vihara temples, 584 Sunday Dhamma Schools, and 42 Pirivenas. Besides, there are 261 archeological protected Buddhist monuments.
The Ministry of Buddha Shasana after meeting the Nayaka Theras of the temples, took necessary measures to improve facilities in them, he said.
Not only the political leadership, but also the leadership at district and Pradeshiya level, the GA and all officers have contributed to the success of these development activities, the minister said.
Hashim said they decided to go the extra mile to improve the conditions of the temples that is to do something other than what the Ministry of Buddha Shasana has been doing.
"We sought assistance of donors in the district. We actually prepared a plan to carry out necessary infrastructure development in temples," he said.
"We also discussed with the embassy of Thailand. They promised us to extend their support to hold the r National Vesak Festival," he added.
He said upon learning that most Buddhist temples in the district did not comprise essential twelve segments that a temple should have; they decided to provide necessary funds to construct those facilities.
"We are going to construct kitchens for the use of some Pirivenas which do not have such facilities under the program. We have already placed action to provide them with gas cookers," Hashim added.
Speaking on the arrangements of Vesak Zones to he had, Hashim said, Because the International Day of Vesak will be hosted by Sri Lanka this year,we expect that there will be a considerable influx of foreign nationals into the country during Vesak.
The international commemorations will include an International Buddhist Conference, with the participation of over 400 delegates from over 100 countries.
Since the delegates will be using the Colombo Mahanuwara road, all Vesak organisers are keen on decorating that road all along, he said. The Internationa Vesak Day will be held in Mahanuwara. the Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka has undertaken to sponsor a main Vesak Zone at Kegalla Nidahas Mawatha, where a Vesak lak lantern competition, Vesak Bhakthi Gee (songs) and essay competitions would be held.
They will be held in other Vesak Zones. There will be Dan Salas in respective Vesak zones. Not only Buddhists but also communities belonging to other religions too will be holding Dan Salas at Vesak zones. Some Muslim nationals have agreed to conduct a Dansala to signify national reconciliation, the minister said.
"There will be a main Vesak Zone in the city of Kegalle. The whole of Mawanella electorate is to be made a Vesak Zone,"he said.
Members of the Mahasangha from the Kegalle District including Ven.Panagamuwe Dhammarathana Thera, Ven.Eladatte Saddhaseela Thera,GA Chandrasiri Bandara, Kegalle Electorate UNP Organiser Lilan Amaratunga and Merchant Bank of Sri Lanka Chairmam Sujeewa Lokuhewa were present at the press conference.

NDBIB pioneers Cornerstone Strategy for IPOs on CSE
NDB Investment Bank (NDBIB) successfully introduced the Cornerstone Investor Strategy to the Colombo bourse via the recent Initial Public Offering (IPO) of RIL Property Limited (RIL).
The IPO was oversubscribed within minutes on the opening day itself amidst healthy participation of value driven institutional investors. The Cornerstone tranche is commonly used in advanced regional markets such as Singapore, Hong Kong and Malaysia and the introduction of this strategy in a frontier market like Sri Lanka is a landmark accomplishment. The introduction of the Cornerstone Investor Strategy is in line with NDBIBs quest for innovation and adds to the many innovative structures and financial products, including that of book building for IPOs, introduced by the company to the capital markets in Sri Lanka.
Darshan Perera, Chief Executive Officer of NDBIB, commented The rationale for the Cornerstone Investor Strategy is to seek initial price validation whilst creating awareness and positive sentiments around an IPO by receiving commitments from prominent institutional investors. Generally, Cornerstone Investors have a profound understanding on business operations of the company, the industry, the market opportunity and actively pursue appropriate valuations, comprehensive due diligence and post-investment monitoring. Such investor commitments are secured for the IPO prior to receiving regulatory approvals and the names of cornerstone investors are prominently disclosed in the Prospectus.
Nilendra Weerasinghe, Vice President and Head-Corporate Advisory, stated Cornerstone Investors are offered sizeable allocations in return for making commitments before they see the market response for an IPO. We have a mandated IPO pipeline of about USD 75 million and will consider using a Cornerstone Strategy for our future issues depending on market conditions. Priority allocations to selected investors may not be possible under the usual proportionate allocation policy followed in an oversubscribed IPO. Cornerstone Investors also agree for lock-in periods to signal that the priority allocations received will not be off-loaded in the market immediately after listing. The reputation and calibre of Cornerstone Investors contributes significantly towards rallying other institutional investor support and retail participation for an IPO. A common market perception is that Cornerstone Investors carryout stringent due diligence on prospective IPO companies prior to giving commitments providing some degree of comfort on IPO pricing as well the future potential of the Company.
The IPO of RIL, a leading developer of commercial office spaces in Colombo, comprised a Cornerstone Tranche of Rs 200 million amounting to 20% of the offer size. NDB Capital Holdings Limited (NCAP), NDBIBs parent company, committed as the Cornerstone Investor whilst agreeing for a minimum allocation of Rs 120 million in the event of an oversubscription.
NCAP further agreed to a voluntary lock-in period of 6 months from the date of listing in line with best practices followed in regional markets. The IPO was jointly managed by Commercial Bank of Ceylon PLC and NDBIB.
As the leader in investment banking in Sri Lanka, NDBIB has unrivalled market share in both debt and equity transactions and Mergers & Acquisitions. Its commitment to continue as the forerunner in innovation by introducing best practices and structures in developed capital markets to Sri Lanka remains firm.
NDBIB envisages to continuously test new grounds and embrace lucrative market opportunities whilst furthering its position as the market leader in investment banking in the country.

Next election in line will be LG elections: Amaraweera
The country's next election which is to be held immediately, would not be a referendum, but Local Government Election, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. He said the Government would take every possible measure to hold LG elections with immediate effect, while there was no need in postponing it, he added.
With the Meethotamulla disaster, it had been proved the need for having LG bodies functioning in the country. Having identified the need, the President advised the relevant Ministers and Government officials to take steps to hold LG elections promptly at the Central Committee meeting of the SLFP recently, he further said.
Accordingly, the next election will be none other than the Local Government election, he said.

No explosion risk at Meethotamulla dump
There is no risk of an explosion at the Meethotamulla garbage dump as speculated by many since scientific research had proved there was no large amount of Methane accumulated to warrant an explosion,Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. The Minister also said that some people and politicians had made certain baseless statements without a proper knowlege of the chances of such an explosion due to the high levels of Methane.
The levels of Methane in the garbage dump are less than 2 percent but the Carbon Monoxide levels are very high inside which could cause an ignition. However the steps have been taken to control such a situation, Minister Ranawaka said.
He made these observations at a press conference at the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry auditorium yesterday.
The Minister also said that within five months the dump site could be stabilised with the support of many institutions including the Tri Forces. Work at the site would be challenging with the impending monsoon rains, Minister Ranawaka said. However, rehabilitation work is being done on the advice of an expert Committee,the Minister added.
He also said that once the garbage dump is rehabilitated, the plan for the site will be revealed.
Minister Ranawaka added that the land had a very high economic value.
No institution dared to implement the project to rehabilitation of the Meethotamulla garbage dump, Minister Ranawaka said. Then we, the Urban Development Authority and our ministry took over the matter. There are many who talk and criticize, but there is none to work, he said.
Megapolis and Western Development Deputy Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna was also present.

Nuclear tests will 'never stop', North Korean government official says

A North Korean government official in a rare interview promised his country's nuclear tests would "never stop" as long as the US continued what they viewed as "acts of aggression."
Speaking to CNN Tuesday, Sok Chol Won wouldn't confirm when the country'slong-anticipated sixth nuclear testwould take place but said it wouldn't be influenced by outside events.
"The nuclear test is an important part of our continued efforts to strengthen our nuclear forces," he said.
"As long as America continues its hostile acts of aggression, we will never stop nuclear and missile tests."
Sok's official title is director of North Korea's Institute of Human Rights at the Academy of Social Sciences, but he was authorized to comment to CNN on all matters.
Another nuclear test could further inflame an already tense situation on the Korean Peninsula, at a time when the Trump administration is moving large amounts of military hardware to the region.
The USS Vinson aircraft carrier is currently on its way to the peninsula, while a nuclear-powered submarine, USS Michigan, arrived in a South Korean port on Tuesday. And the THAAD anti-missile system designed to mitigate the threat of North Korea's missileswill be operational "in the coming days," the top US commander in the Pacific said.
Sok said Tuesday's massive artillery drill, held onthe 85th anniversary of North Korea's army, was a warning to US President Donald Trump.
"This exercise is a direct response to acts of aggression by the United States," he said.
When asked about the three US citizens currently held in North Korean custody, including Kim Sang Dukwho was arrested on Saturday, Sok only said they were being kept in the same conditions as other prisoners.
He strongly denied statements made by defectors of brutal North Korean prison camps, whereup to 120,000 men, women and childrenare believed to be held.
"Those people (defectors) are criminals who ran away, they're paid to lie and encouraged by the US and their followers," he said.
"The UN wants to politicize the human rights issue, use it to interfere with our internal affairs. Their reports are nothing but fiction."
Sok said human rights meant defending North Korea and its supreme leader Kim Jong Un, even if it meant nuclear war.

## Title: Reforms long overdue

## Section: Features

Reforms long overdue
The news-media recently carried reports that the Education Ministry is planning to set in motion a process of education reforms. It will no doubt be most welcome since much is to be desired in the education system as prevailing today. New demands are constantly made emphasizing the necessity to ensure that education is kept relevant, result-oriented and above all consistent with the national development goals which should necessarily reflect in the National Educational Policy. It is also abundantly important to keep abreast of new trends in education constantly being experimented upon and implemented all over the world. It is incumbent on those in charge of education to ensure that we do not lose track of new happenings in a world which is experiencing a knowledge explosion in all aspects of education.
Reforms that are envisaged should no doubt lead to a good hard look at the content and delivery of education from primary to the tertiary level, identifying the gaps and growth points in the existing system and making informed decisions whether the right system is in place to address both the current and emerging needs of education in the country. If the answers are in the negative, needless to say, immediate steps should be taken to bring about the necessary changes in the system as a whole inclusive of setting up new institutions and structures if deemed necessary.
The flaws prevalent in the education system are also the reason for extensive lawlessness among the youth of the country including drug abuse and its nasty implications to the well-being of the society at large. It has also made a mockery of university education churning out disillusioned graduates with unemployment and a bleak future staring them in their face. This is not because they are not educated but because they are educated for unemployment and not employment.
Developing countries
The world, as we see it today, consists of a large number of developing countries that are trying to emerge from years of neglect and exploitation. Sri Lanka is one of them. It has to be understood that no country can develop unless it concentrates its energies on developing and nurturing their human resources. That is precisely the function of education. One question that needs to be asked is whether our education system from primary to tertiary is geared to develop human resources. Are they sufficiently equipped when they enter the world of work, to lend their shoulders to whatever development tasks for which human resources with job-specific skills are called for
When Lee Kwan Yev took charge of a mass of land which we now call Singapore, it was only a backward village, without any material resources except the sea surrounding it. But he had a vision to turn it into a flourishing state as we see it today. He was able to accomplish this during his life time, because he had the vision to start off this fantastic development process by first developing human resources. This was done by revamping and rebuilding the schools and other educational institutions to cater to the development needs of the new nation. The end-result was the emergence of an educated and responsible citizenry. Not only did they have the needed technological know-how, but also a deep sense of ethics and love for their country. Singapore is now widely recognized as a shipping hub, financial hub and above all an educational hub.
It has to be remembered that Sri Lanka was far ahead when countries like Singapore were struggling to stand on their feet. But with lethargy and a sense of complacency setting in, we started lagging behind. This I attribute to the lack of forward thinking, lop-sided planning and the sense of one-upmanship displayed by politicians not concerned of the common good.
Development goals
Hence while acknowledging the importance of education reforms to ensure the system continues to deliver the desired objectives of over-all national development goals, it has to be noted that those who are charged with the reforms should be given a free hand to have discussions with all concerned parties in this field. It has to be emphasized that unlike in other areas of social activity every member of the society has a stake in education be it the students, the teacher and school principal, the university lecturers, parents and even grandparents. The authorities have to be sensitive to the opinions and reservations expressed by these stakeholders on any issue pertaining to education.
Creating awareness on key areas that are subject to reforms and developing a consensus among interested parties should be the main objective. In the case of contentious issues with varying opinions it is advisable to encourage a national debate where the mass-media, both electronic and print could be widely used. Ultimately when the reform package is announced the stakeholders should feel that their voices were heard during the reform process and they had the opportunity to contribute to its outcome.
Disastrous consequences
The other matter of paramount importance is the need to get the opposition on board to ensure there will be continuity when it comes to implementation of the reforms that are recommended. We have to recognize the fact that in any active and vibrant democracy the opposition is regarded as the government-in-waiting.
When a new government is formed there is always a tendency to tinker with education. At times this even leads to throwing overboard the entire system put in place by the previous government. This is indeed unfortunate because it leads to the student becoming mere guinea-pigs in experimentations driven more by political expediency than by educational considerations.
Most of us vividly remember the 1970s when extensive educational reforms were affected with the introduction of pre-vocational studies from Grade 6 onwards and National Certificate of General Education (NCGE) introduced as the terminal examination instead of the all too familiar GCE.
While most of those at the receiving end of these reforms are around holding different responsibilities in society some of those at the giving end working at the Education Ministry implementing the reforms like the writer himself are also around to recount the disastrous consequences faced by the students when the reforms were totally rejected by the government that was installed after a subsequent election.
This resulted in the students who followed the NCGE syllabus being placed in a quandary. Some of those who sat the NCGE examination had to face the sad prospect of preparing and sitting for the GCE.
The prevocational studies that were assiduously taught and learnt by all students in the country gave them for the first time hands-on experience in accordance with the highly acclaimed UNESCO principle of learning by doing. Because of this new change neglected spaces in the school compound were turned into vegetable garden and model farms. Spare classroom became veritable workshop.
Students while preparing for their normal subjects were given the opportunity to develop their psycho-motor skills. Some even acquired sufficient skills in art and craft to be self employed in later life. On the whole good thinking had gone into the introduction of the new subject.
Teachers too were trained in Teachers colleges to teach this subject and community education was made an integral component of the teacher training syllabus.
It was indeed sad when the whole scheme was stalled with the change of regime putting the students in total disarray. In retrospect the writer strongly feels that the regime that introduced these reforms, however relevant it may have been, should have concurred with the opposition to ensure continuity.
One upmanship when it comes to education can be disastrous and should be avoided at all cost. Educational reforms have to be seen as an exercise that prepare students to face the challenges of tomorrow, and hence all stakeholders must be involved in the reform process.

Regulations needed before ETCA, FTAs are signed - CCI SG
A proper regulatory mechanism should be in place before entering into foreign trade agreements, Construction Industry Chamber Secretary General and CEO, Nissanka N Wijeratne said.
As per the ETCA agreement and FTA with China, the construction sector will opened out to a certain extent. But the problem is although the Construction Industry Development Act was passed in 2014 not a single regulation under the Act has been passed. Without regulations the provisions of the Act cannot be implemented, Wijeratne said.
If free trade agreements are signed and the sectors are opened without regulatory mechanisms, it will be a free run for those companies and it applies to even other sectors. Anti dumping we still dont have a law, so if those things are implemented then of course there is no harm opening out and getting benefits from those agreements. Otherwise it will be dangerous Wijeratne opined.
The industry is also marred with other burning issued such as the shortage of labour especially for projects in Colombo and once the rain sets in the problem will get much severe because the employees will go back to farming. The next burning issue is the scarcity of sand. The sand price has increased to Rs 16,000 per cube and the chamber has been pressing for as alternative of river sand the government should facilitate supply of washed and sieved sea sand. The Muthurajawela plant alone cannot supply the total requirement of the Western Province at least another two parties must be allowed to pump sea sand.
Although the chamber agrees of banning river sand mining there must be an alternative, he said.
The government has not intervened to solve this problem he said.The promise to provide sieved sea sand from January 1 too had not materialised yet he alleged.
Constructors in Colombo alone need 8 million cubic meters of sand he said.
Also there is a shortage of crush rock in the industry and there are delays in obtaining permits. he said.
The last budget has also heavily burdened the construction Industry with taxes and also imposed a 5% withholding tax on contractors. After protests the government has revised it to 2.5% but it has not yet been gazetted he said. Wijeratne said the Chamber feels that it should however not be more than 1%. On top of that a 2% NBT has been also levied on Contractors he said. This will increase the overall construction cost due to snowballing effect by 5% he alleged.

The right move
An English daily ran as its main story on Wednesday that President Maithripala Sirisena had proposed the setting up of a Committee headed by Minister Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to deal with emergency situations such as disruption to power, work stoppages at the port, fuel distribution etc. This was in response to several ministers pointing to the near anarchic situation that prevailed on Monday following the petroleum strike called by the CPC unions. It was pointed out at the Cabinet meeting chaired by the President that some 1,500 petroleum workers were able to cripple all government activities on that day and that there should not be a repetition of such a situation. The Ministers stressed that the military should be equipped to deal with emergency situations to ensure public life is not disrupted. That probably may have been the reason for the President to suggest that the war winning army commander head the Committee that will also include other stakeholders such as the military and the Law and Order Ministry.
The proposal, no doubt, will be welcomed by most who would not want the even tenor of their lives disrupted by anarchic elements who prevent essential services reaching them. Today, the citys landscape is marred by frequent protest marches and agitations resulting in chaos on the highways. The New Year festival provided a welcome breather and the Petroleum strike signaled the return to business. The GMOA too has announced that it is going to devote the month of May for strike action, once again causing distress to the sick. The government is increasingly being conceived by the public as being soft in not tackling the situation with a heavy hand. Perhaps the Yahapalanaya tag attached to the regime has proved a millstone round the neck of the government. But it cannot stand by and watch as the country descends to anarchy. Decisive action is called for to ensure public life is not disrupted as a result of politically motivated strikes.
Governments are elected to govern. Different governments have different styles in governing. Their policies too differ. These policies may not be to the liking of some, Trade Unions included. But they (TUs) cannot be allowed to call the shots on matters that are unrelated to their personal welfare or work conditions, as was the case with regard to the Petroleum strike. The Unions struck work against an alleged move to sell the Trincomalee oil tank farm to the Indians. Even if such an agreement was to be signed, this certainly would not endanger the jobs of the strikers. Besides, this was a matter to do with the countrys trade and economy where they (TUs) have little or no stake. If the trade unions are allowed to dictate terms on how the government should conduct its economic policy there will be no knowing where things are going to end up. It will be akin to the doctors striking against ETCA which is well beyond their remit.
Be that as it may, agitations by trade unions are not always based on their own interests or that of the country. In a majority of the instances these TUs are being manipulated by politicians. A good example is the recent doctors strike where one of the GMOAs big guns delivered a speech that took on a political flavour. The garbage crisis too saw the public being instigated by politicians.
True, most Trade Unions today operate on party lines to which there can be no objections. But it should be ensured that their actions dont go beyond permissible limits. Mondays petroleum strike came without warning that took the public unawares. It is the duty of any responsible government to ensure public life is not disrupted as a result of the denial of essential services. It should employ every means towards this end. If the military is deployed in the public interest to make sure essential supplies reach them without hindrance, so be it. It will be recalled that army personnel commandeered SLTB buses during the height of the JVP violence in 1989.
There is little doubt that more work stoppages and disruptions are in store in the coming days as the political temperature hots up. The government should be prepared for any eventuality. The strategy will be to target those services which the public cannot do without. This way the public wrath against the government would that much more pronounced. Anti-government TV channels would be dutifully on the scene to record the public indignation that would be beamed to the homes of the citizenry.
In Fonseka, the government will have the ideal choice to deal with emergency situations such as the petroleum strike. Declaring garbage collection an essential service did not have much impact. Protests are still continuing, with garbage trucks blocked from reaching their destinations. What is needed is a military presence to deal with such situations. The Joint Opposition too will not be able to blame the military for any highhanded action. If they do their war hero cries would be rendered hollow.

Royal College Rowing Crew stamp their class in Hong Kong
The Royal College, Colombo Rowing Crew of 2016 stamped their class by winning medals in all events they have participated at the recently concluded 62nd Head of the Bay regatta conducted by the the Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club (RHKYC) at the Middle Island club house in Hong Kong.
The Head of the Bay regatta is a time trial race rowed over either a 2.5km fine rowing course or a 5km coastal rowing course. What makes this race unique is the fact that it is held in an open water course instead of the flat waters where most regattas are held. The oarsmen faced new challenges from water conditions and difficult navigations throughout the race. Unlike the common straight courses, the Deep Water Bay course requires coxswains to accurately steer to marker buoys and complete quick turns around them. This different style of racing made it an interesting and completely new experience.
The Royal Hong Kong Yacht Club is one of the oldest sports clubs in Hong Kong and have a rich and colourful history of over 170 years. The regatta was participated by 11 Clubs and representatives from 4 Counties.
The Royalist who entered in the Fine Course event dominated the category winning every event included the Mens U19 Fine 1x won by the 2017 captain Hashen Hettigoda.
The Mens U19 4x was won by the Royal Crew comprising Waruna Hewamanne, Kaveen Rajapakshe, Hashen Hettigoda, Jatu Rockwood and Coxed by Revata Karunasundera with a timing of 11.09 which was ranked as the best time in the regatta for the fine boats category. The Mens Open 2x was won by Hashen Weerakkody and Praveen Weerakkody.
The Mens fine open 4+ was won by The Royal College A crew which was stroked by Prathap Perera with Praveen Happugale at Three, Charin Wijethilleka at Two, Lasaru Kudaligama at Bow and Coxed by Avishka Jayaweera, where as the Royal College B4+ Stroked by Kaveen Rajapaksha with Praveen Weerakkody at Three, Kavinda Mathew at Two, Lasindu Gamage at Bow, coxed by Revata Karunasundera came in second only behind the A crew by 2 seconds. Both the A and B crews which timed 11:32 and 11:34 respectively, ranked as the 2nd and 3rd best timings for the fine boats category.
This was a significant achievement as the Royal crew managed to perform at such a caliber displaying class, skill. It was a memorable tour as it had been over a decade since the entire team represented school internationally. The RHKYC was pleased by the Royalists visit and invited them to participate again in the future.

Sanitary waste dump in Muthurajawela
A sanitary waste dump is to be constructed in Muthurajawela in 40 days to manage the waste generated in the Colombo Municipal Council area.
Cabinet this week granted approval to build the above waste dump to accommodate 400MT of waste per day.
A committee comprised of officials from the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government, Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment and Ministry of Megapolis and Western Development was appointed to work on the garbage issue soon after the Meethotamulla disaster and recommended the above measure. The committee had thereafter reviewed a proposal put forward by the Waste Management Research Unit of the University of Peradeniya.
The proposal, according to Co-Cabinet spokesperson, Gayantha Karunathilake, was presented to the Japanese team which had flown down to inspect Meethotamulla, and they too had agreed with the engineering standards of the project.
While approximately 750 MT of waster is collected from Colombo daily, the Ministry of Provincial Councils and Local Government had pointed out that through recycling and composting, the waste amount could be brought down to 400 MT and thus the dump site would be able to accommodate the waste in five acres of land.
The government land for the above purpose has been chosen within the Wattala Divisional Secretary Division, in the Muthurajawela-Pattiyawela Grama Niladhari Division. The cabinet paper on the subject notes that there were no residents found in the surrounding area of the dump.
The Army and Civil Defence Force are to take on the construction work.
The courts had earlier allowed garbage from Colombo to temporarily be dumped in the dumpsites of Karadiyana and Dompe but continuous protests from residents of these areas have made it urgent that the government find alternative dump sites to dispose Colombos garbage.
Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Dr. Rajitha Senaratna commenting on the protests said,; All talk of a unitary state, but when it comes to garbage, everyone wants federal.

Seylan Bank posts Rs 866 mn profit in first quarter 2017
Seylan Bank has reported commendable performance in the first quarter of 2017 recording profit-after-tax of Rs.866 million, a 20% Year on Year growth.
The Bank increased its Net Interest Income and recorded a robust growth of 20.97% in spite of the mounting pressure on the margins due to rising cost of funds. However Net interest Margin contracted from 4.19% in 2016 to 3.92% in 1Q 2017 due to cost of deposits increasing at a faster rate than the re-pricing of loans.
Net fee and commission income witnessed a healthy growth of 24.94% to reach Rs. 869 million in 1Q 2017 as compared to Rs. 695 million for the comparative period. This was mainly attributed from core banking related business such as card-related income, trade finance related fee income and fees from guarantees and remittances. The Bank will continue to look towards enhancing its fee-based income from products such as debit and credit cards and trade-related products.
Other operating income comprising net gains from trading, gains from financial investments, gains on foreign exchange and other income reported a net gain of Rs. 299 million compared to loss of Rs. 68 million in 1Q 2016.
Impairment charges for loans and other losses for the period was a charge of Rs. 346 Million as compared to a charge of Rs. 84 Million in Q1 2016. Individual impairment charges of Rs. 253 Million represent specific provisions made for few credit exposures. The Bank has a stringent recovery process in place to minimise any significant losses that may arise from such loan facilities.
Total expenses recorded an increase of 19.03% from 2,273 Million in the 1Q of the previous year to Rs. 2,705 Million during the period under review. Expenses growth was witnessed by investments made in employees, technology, upgrading and refurbishment of branches etc.
Cost efficiency and productivity has taken a predominant role in the Banks day-to-day operations. The Bank continues to focus on cost initiatives coupled with implementation of lean concepts and exploring ways of inculcating a culture of working smarter across all the functions by the employees.
The Banks loans and advances portfolio recorded a marginal growth of 2.76% to 242,531 Million during the 1Q 2017 amidst rising interest rates. The growth in credit was driven primarily by Term Loans, Overdrafts and Credit Cards. The overall deposit base recorded a marginal growth of 0.24% from Rs.273,456 Million by the corresponding quarter last year to 274,120 Million by 1Q 2017 and a shift from low cost CASA to term deposits was noted which is partly due to increase in interest rates.

SF overall Commander
Presidents suggestion under consideration:
I will do any duty for countrys sake:
President Maithripala Sirisena has asked Field Marshall Sarath Fonseka whether he would be interested in resigning from his ministerial portfolio to take up the post of an Army Commander or Overall Commander of the Tri-Forces to bring about discipline in the country, Co-Cabinet Spokesperson, Minister Rajitha Senaratna said yesterday.
The Field Marshall had responded that he was willing to take on any responsible post for the sake of the country. Senaratne added that the Cabinet had responded positively to the proposal made by the President.
Minister Senaratne addressing the weekly Cabinet briefing at the Government Information Department, said the suggestion came about, given the increasing number of protests and public agitations which have hindered development programmes in the country.
This week alone, strike action by the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) unions brought to a halt the fuel supply in the country wreaking havoc among the public.
The unions were protesting against an alleged agreement with India over the Trincomalee Oil Farm tanks. Earlier this month, hospitals around the country had to turn away patients as doctors launched trade union action over private medical universities.
You do not want the Trincomalee tanks to be given away but what have we done for the last 100 years with it Do we want to keep it as an artifact, asked the Health Minister.
The GMOA now says that they are going to shift their focus on ETCA. There are protests at every corner.
Minister Senaratne however stressed that no definite role or responsibilities for the Field Marshall, who currently holds the Ministry of Regional Development has been decided as of yet.
The Minister also denied allegations that the government was increasingly moving towards militarisation and was trying to create another Gotabhaya Rajapaksa; the former Defence Secretary was famed for his intolerance towards dissent.
The government is always talking to unions and many a time, strikes have been called without proper knowledge. People complain that the President and Prime Minister have been quiet for too long. For those who say the government is spineless, we are about to have a spine, the Health Minister said.

Sri Lanka overturns ban on adopting baby elephants

The Sri Lankan government has decided to overturn its ban on the adoption of baby elephants in a bid to overcome difficulties maintaining the Pinnawala Elephant Orphanage as well as overcoming the issue of overcrowding, the International Business Times reported.
The Cabinet has approved a proposal put forward by Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Minister of Sustainable Development and Wildlife, which opens the doors for baby elephants to be adopted by individuals and religious places under specific conditions.
In his proposal, the minister said that it has become a "difficult task" to maintain the 88 elephants at the orphanage, which spans over 30 acres of restricted land. The orphanage runs a successful breeding program.
Elephants are allowed for the Perahera, or religious processions. The cabinet also approved the regularisation of the registration of domesticated elephants and their protection.
"Wildlife conservation is good, but we also need to conserve our cultural pageants," government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told AFP, which said that the ban on the adoption of elephants had raised concerns on whether there will be enough tame elephants for Buddhist pageants.
Senaratne also said that strict conditions will be put in place to ensure the protection of the animals adopted.
Individuals wishing to adopt an elephant will have to pay 10m rupees (51,141, 60,334, $65,800) while temples will get them for free.
Sri Lanka banned the use of young elephants for logging and other physical work last year as part of stricter laws protecting the animals.
Official records show that there are about 7,500 wild elephants in the country. Catching wild elephants is illegal in Sri Lanka. There are about 200 domesticated elephants.
In Sri Lanka, having an elephant has become a status symbol for the wealthy, AFP reports.
Elephants are also kept by temples for use in religious ceremonies. The animals are revered as holy in Sri Lanka and India.
However, there remains opposition to separating elephant calves from their parents.
An Asian elephant expert, Jayantha Jayewardene, told AFP that the government's decision is "ill-thought out and totally irresponsible". He accused the government of selling the animals to raise money.
In early April, wildlife enthusiasts successfully stopped an elephant calf from being handed over to New Zealand during a visit by its then-Prime Minister, John Key, to the country.
Omalpe Sobitha, a Buddhist monk, had said that the six-year old elephant Nandi should not be separated from her parents, who were both being cared for at Pinnawala.
He said the move by the government could affect elephant calves that had been sent to Pinnawala after they were seized from wealthy Sri Lankans accused of keeping them illegally.
"We are very surprised by the decision to give back these elephants. It is a sad day for conservation," he added.

Tea Exporters cry foul over high taxes, CESS, levies
The Tea Exporters Association (TEA) has complained of the high taxes imposed on the sector.
They lament that every exporter should renew their licence with the Tea Board (SLTB) annually at a cost of Rs. 500,000 for large and medium tea companies and Rs. 50,000 for small companies.
The CESS and Promotion Levy paid on export
of value added teas comes to Rs. 7.50 per kg and about Rs. 17.50 per kg on export of bulk tea.The income tax payment, economic service charge and other fees paid to SLTB and other state
organizations also add to the operational cost of tea exporters.
According to Sri Lanka Customs data over Rs. 2 billion per annum is collected from tea exporters as CESS on bulk and value added tea exports. A further Rs. 1 billion is collected as Tea Promotion Levy by SLTB from the exporters.
The total CESS and tea promotion levy paid by the exporters amount to around 1.5% of the annual tea exports revenue. This may be the highest CESS payments made by the tea exporters in a tea producing country.
The members of Tea Exporters Association point out that this happening at a time when tea production is on a declining trend in the last few years due to many issues.
The exporters are also worried about the slow implementation of budget proposals related to tea export sector. It has been proposed to abolish the Import and Export Control Department Fee of 1% of CIF value on import of tea for re-export purposes to support the tea industry through a more simplified tax and tariff structure in the 2017 Budget.
The Tea Exporters Association had been lobbying for removal of this fee as tea exporters pay a licence fee of Rs. 5.00 per kg to the Sri Lanka Tea Board also when importing tea for re-exports. The dual taxation on tea import licences currently applicable for the import of CTC,Green and Specialty teas is negatively affecting the competitiveness of Sri Lanka tea brands. However, this proposal is yet to be implemented by the government.
They also point out that Tea Fund since the establishment in November 2010 conducted only a few useful promotional activities have been undertaken in foreign markets and as a result the accumulation of the fund has now reached Rs 6 to 7 billion.
We strongly believe that further accumulation of funds may prompt the Treasury to force the Tea Board to use the idling funds for recurrent expenditure or for other non-promotional activities.
The delay in implementation of the global Ceylon Tea campaign is not due to any fault of the tea exporters but due to strict government tender procedures and other regulations.
In view of the current situation, TEA has requested SLTB to initiate action to suspend the tea promotion levy until the launch of Global Ceylon Tea Campaign is finalised.

Testing organisational capacity
Every organisation exists only because of the people who are a part of it, and those people both shape and interpret the character and culture of the organisation. But creating and maintaining a high-performance culture is not easy in todays turbulent environment and changing workplace.
An organisation that tries to stand still may not survive. In order to achieve long term growth, organisations need novel replacements, new products or breakthrough products. Successful organisations are generally effective in responding to evolutionary changes in business environment particularly the market and have the capacity to absorb innovation into organisational culture which lies at the heart of organisational innovation.
Culture defers from country to country and organisation to organisation. An organisation that does not understand its own culture is like a person without an identity. To encourage change and positive growth the first step is to analyze the existing culture. Even if an organisation is relatively satisfied with its culture, assessment is still important to provide a common language for a conversation about current culture, workspace, and direction for the future.
Culture creates a sense of order, continuity, and commitment that permeates every aspect of the organisation from how employees interact to customer perceptions. Culture is often difficult for an organisation to articulate, but its impact is far reaching and influences management process, product and services, employee motivation, attention and retention, productivity, reputation and ultimately the bottom line.
Good corporate culture
Organisation culture is what organisational members learn over a period of time as they solve problems of survival. It is the pattern of basic assumptions that have been evolved, discovered or developed by a given group as it learns to cope with its problems of external adaptation and internal integration. Culture also expressed through the organisations myths, heroes, legends, stories, jargon, rites, and rituals. Culture is social glue that binds members of the organisation together through shared values, symbolic devices and social ideas.
Good corporate culture is not accidental. Successful organisational cultures are intentional by design, and not the product of default or serendipity. High-performance organisations set, manage, and monitor culture to achieve strategic objectives. In order to meet the organisational objectives and achieve competitive advantage, all organisations are thriving to recruit highly performing individuals. On the other hand, individuals need supportive organisational culture to help them reach individual objectives.
The selection process, performance evaluation criteria, training and development activities, and promotion procedures ensure that those hired fit in with the culture, reward those who support it and penalize those who challenge it. Further, the action of top management and socialization methods play a particularly vital part in sustaining culture.
Several challenges stand in the way of becoming more innovative, including the need to meet financial expectations and continue or extend the life of existing products and services. The biggest challenge many organisations face is creating a culture that supports and embraces innovation.
Most cultures are fairly resilient and resist change. Even when the corporate outlook is dire, it can be difficult to change a corporate culture. Decreasing resistance to change is important because the attitudes of those within the organisation greatly influence the success of change. Change does not come overnight. Outperformers have developed their performance excellence systematically and in a disciplined manner over extended period of time. Creation of high performance culture requires ambition, vision and courage. Spiritual leadership can dramatically reduce negative feelings, emotions and conflicts that are often present in organisations.

Different communication channels
Leadership is a core factor of organisational culture. In organisations that have had innovation success, a good portion of the credit goes to CEOs with visionary leadership to demand innovation and the fortitude to invest the necessary resources for senior management time and energy in talent management. Knowledge management also plays a key role on performance improvement of an organisation. For an effective knowledge management that can support the successful processes of an organisation should be supported by the organisations culture.
As rational individuals, most of us do what we are compensated and motivated to do. If an organisation has a focus on cost cutting and process excellence, it is likely that the compensation schemes encourage and reinforce those behaviours. However, most organisations unintentionally discourage new product development and risk taking because there are no clear compensation strategies for innovation. Also the widespread practice of viewing budgets as commitments to be delivered produces a number of performance limiting effects.
Constant communication set the stage for reviewing strategic plans, evaluating senior executives and setting expectations throughout the organisation about the importance of innovation thus need to plan a consistent, cohesive communication strategy over a significant period of time to change corporate culture to make it more accommodating to innovation through communication. By using number of different communication channels including, the corporate magazine, newsletter, voice mails and video clips, every employees role in innovation can be reinforced.
Training is an important component of cultural change, since it is unrealistic to expect people to take new responsibilities and innovate consistently without giving new tools and methods. Einstein defined insanity as doing the same things over and over again and expecting different results. Communication tells people what to do and training tells them new methods, processes and tools for innovation. Different results cannot expect from the same process without incorporating training on new thinking.
Trust and honesty are an essential part of successful business relationships. Also organisations care about its employees as much as it expects them to care about customers. Further individual employees should think for themselves and do what they believe is right to provide exceptional customer service. But most organisational members are not consciously aware of these deeply embedded values in a culture.
Rules and regulations of an organisation are considered an inalienable part of the culture. Friendly and supportive working environment ensures that the rules and regulations of an organisation are well defined and not a burden to its employees. It is important that employees feel motivated to follow the rules and regulations and are not being forced which leads to employee satisfaction and positive associations with the organisation, management and respective individual positions.
Corporate culture can work for an organisation to improve performance or against it by creating barriers that prevent the attainment of goals. It shapes the way people act, interact and strongly influences how things get done. Unhealthy cultural values played a crucial role in many of the mistakes that organisations made. Subcultures within the organisation sometimes contradict the large culture, adding to the complexity of diagnosis. The correct relationship among cultural values, organisational strategy and the external environment can enhance organisational performance.
People make change. Clear strategy and effective operations brings us to the optimal results. The ongoing transformation of an organisation is the results of the growth of the people who make up the organisation.
Therefore, organisations need to develop systematic ways to measure and manage the impact of culture on organisational performance.

Two-thousand deaths and twenty thousand hospitalized due to kidney disease

Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne has said that according to the latest health statistics, annually about 20,000 Sri Lankans are hospitalized and around 2000 die due to various kidney diseases.
The Minister expressed these views during a recent ceremony held in Colombo.
According to Minister Senaratne, the number of patients who suffer from Chronic Kidney Disease of Unknown Origin (CKDU) is around 38,000.
Around 4000 CKDU patients were reported from Anuradhapura and Polonnaruwa districts along during the past four years.
Minister Senaratne pointed out that researching on CKDU commenced in 2008 and the Presidential task Force set up in 2014.
Malnutrition and Anemia are two common health issues among kidney patients.
The lives of kidney patients can be uplifted through correct nutrition.
This is proved scientifically. Plans are now being made to recruit 300 nutritionists to the Health Ministry soon.
The country needs more nutritionists in order t look after the health of kidney patients and the food habits of all patients who suffer from Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs), he added.

United Airlines report: Our review shows that many things went wrong that day

In a new report, United Airlines admits several mistakes were made before, during and after a man was violently dragged off a flight earlier this month, including calling in law enforcement to resolve an incident that was neither a safety nor security issue The Washington Post reported.
In the report, released Thursday, the airline says it had allowed internal policies to distract from the need to treat passengers with dignity and respect and it outlines what the company intends to do to prevent a repeat of the incident.
This is a turning point for all of us at United and it signals a culture shift toward becoming a better, more customer-focused airline, CEO Oscar Munoz said in a statement that accompanied the release of the report on the April 9 incident at Chicagos OHare International Airport. Our customers should be at the center of everything we do and these changes are just the beginning of how we will earn back their trust.
With the report, Munoz makes good on a public promise he made several days after David Dao, 69, was dragged out of his seat, down the aisle and off the plane after he refused to give up his seat for off-duty crew. Other passengers captured the incident on their phones and shared video that has been viewed millions of times worldwide and sparked international outrage.
Lawyers representing Dao said he suffered a concussion, broken nose and two missing teeth, among other injuries. Four aviation security officers involved in the incident have been placed on leave while the investigation continues.
United Airlines takes full responsibility for what happened, reads the reports introduction. The intention of this report is to communicate concrete and meaningful actions that will avoid putting our customers, employees and partners in impossible situations.
The report lays out five ways in which United says it failed both its passengers and employees. In addition to unnecessarily summoning law enforcement, the airline should not have tried to find space on the flight for crew members at the last minute. It also should have offered more compensation or more transportation options in order to entice customers to give up their seats voluntarily, but it acknowledged that agents did not have the authority to make such decisions. Finally, the report said the airline has not provide regular training for employees on how to deal with denied boarding situations.
Our review shows that many things went wrong that day, but the headline is clear: Our policies got in the way of our values and procedures interfered in doing whats right, Munoz said.
The report, which outlines 10 changesthe airline is makingto prevent a repeat of the incident, is the most detailed account yet of the events that led to Daos removal from Flight 3411,
According to the report, Flight 3411, scheduled to leave Chicago at 5:40 p.m. for Louisville, was overbooked by one seat. After no volunteers came forward, the airline bumped a passenger who had not yet received a seating assignment. That person received a check as compensation and was booked on another United flight, the report said. The remaining passengers were allowed to board.
At the same time, however, another United flight to Louisville that had been scheduled to depart at 2:55 p.m. was delayed because of mechanical difficulties. The airline needed to get four crew members who had been booked on that earlier flight to Louisville on Sunday night in order to prevent at least one  and possibly  several other flights from being canceled.
And so the crew members were rebooked on Flight 3411. As a result, the airline needed four of the 70 passengers aboard to give up their seats. The gate agent offered $800 in travel credits plus the cost of meals and a hotel stay and when no one came forward, the agent followed Uniteds procedure for involuntarily bumping passengers. A United supervisor boarded the plane and told a couple they would have to leave. The couple left. The supervisor then told Dao and his wife they would have to leave. Dao refused. After multiple refusals, United officials told Dao they would call authorities if he continued to protest. At this point another passenger volunteered to leave the plane in exchange for $1,000 in compensation. But United officials still needed a fourth seat. Chicago Department of Aviation officers, who the report noted, historically [have] been effective in getting customers to voluntarily comply then arrived on the scene. They too were unsuccessful in persuading Dao to leave.
According to the report, the United supervisor left the aircraft to call a manager. It was at that point that Dao, the report said, . . . was physically removed from the aircraft, by the aviation security officers.
That moment, captured on video by other passengers aboard the flight, showed Dao yelling as he is pulled from his seat and then dragged down the aisle of the plane.
But United is promising change.
Under the airlines new customer-first policy, travelers who voluntarily give up their seats will be eligible to receive up to $10,000 in travel certificates. United employees will be given new authority to find creative solutions to get bumped passengers to their final destinations  even if it means booking them on another airline or sending them to another airport.
In addition to increasing the compensation for passengers who voluntarily give up their seats, the airline will create an automated system to identify passengers willing to give up their seats and allow them to set the level of compensation they would be willing to accept. Starting in August, the airline also will offer additional training for front-line staff and later this year will roll out an app that will allow employees to immediately compensate customers when a service issue arises. It also will create a customer solutions team charged with finding ways to get displaced passengers where they need to go.
Even though United officials say only a small percentage of passengers are involuntarily bumped from the airlines flights, they said they will reduce overbooking on those flights where volunteers are less likely to come forward. Overbooking is not illegal, but has drawn new scrutiny from members of Congress following the airlines treatment of Dao.
Its unclear whether Uniteds actions will be enough to satisfy lawmakers who are already demanding changes to the way airlines treat customers. Among the provisions of abill introducedin the Senate on Wednesday is one that would require the Secretary of Transportation to re-examine airlines practice of overbooking to determine whether limits should be placed on how many seats an airline can sell.
United had already announced some new procedures and changes. Munoz said the airline will limit the use of law enforcement to safety and security issues only. He also announced that the airline will no longer bump passengers once they have boarded their flight unless it involves a safety or security issue.
The report notes that after being removed from the plane, Dao returned and according to video and passenger accounts, his face was bloodied. Incident reports released by the Chicago Department of Aviation this week saidDao became increasingly combative and began swinging his arms with his fistsclosed after one of the officers tried to grab him. It says the officer was able to pull Dao upfrom his seat and toward the aisle, but then lost his grip because Dao kept fighting. The police report said Dao was removed from the plane with minimal but necessary force.
Munoz, however, again apologized for the events and took responsibility.
Every customer deserves to be treated with the highest levels of service and the deepest sense of dignity and respect, he said. Two weeks ago, we failed to meet that standard and we profoundly apologize.

UNP, only representative of the working class: Range Bandara
Skills Development and Vocational Training State Minister Palitha Range Bandara said yesterday that after assuming power, the UNP is the only political party that fulfilled promises made to the working class during the election campaign.
"The UNP said they would increase the salaries of the public servants and we did it within one year of assuming office. We also raised the salaries of private workers and the entire working class. In accordance with our promises to increase the efficiency of public servants, we directed them to various foreign and local training programmes while introducing the latest technology to them. We also activated all non-functioning anti corruption bodies to tackle malpractices and corruption. Now the working class has acknowledged that the UNP is the real representative of the working class," he said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Sirikotha yesterday, he said the government has also engaged in uplifting not only the working class, but the entire population. "Thousands of new houses are being built for the ordinary people. The monthly medical bill of most medicine users has reduced by about 40 percent due to the reduction in drug prices. The country has also received due recognition from the international community. But, certain politicians who have lost the people's trust are now making various allegations and engaged in various demonstrations against the government. But, those are the people who shot and killed protesters in Rathupaswala. He said that all arrangements have been made to hold the UNPs May Day rally at Campbell grounds on grand scale on May 1. We expect at least 200,000 people to participate in the rally. We urge everyone that if they support fraudsters and corrupt politicians to go to the JO May Day rally at Galle Face Green and all those who oppose them to come to our May Day rally at Campbell grounds. We have spent only party funds on May Day cut-outs," he added.
Wayamba Provincial Council Opposition Leader Prasanna Shamal Senarath said that the oil tanks in Trincomalee has been lying idol for the past 90 years. "Just as when we are making plans to make better use of it several self-serving politicians with sinister motives are trying to cripple it. It was in 2003, that the agreement was entered into with IOC to utilize the oil tanks in a more efficiency way. Accordingly, IOC is using 15 oil tanks and other 85 tanks are empty. It is a criminal folly to let these resources go to waste."
He further said the new contingency unit under the Regional Development Minister Sarath Fonseka will help the government to face crisis situations in crucial sectors such as power and energy.
"Everyone has a right to engage in demonstrations, but, they cannot interrupt or intimidate the activities of the ordinary people," he said.

Accordingto the statement, Thailand and Bangladesh have completed mass drug administration (key initiative for LF elimination) in all endemic areas, while India became the first country globally to be verified for yaws elimination and formally acknowledged to be yaws free in 2016.
The region is closer to achieving elimination of kala-azar as a public health problem.
Though there has been progress, much remains to be done.
Home to one fourth of the world population, WHO South-East Asia continues to bear the second highest burden of NTDs among six regions of WHO, said the statement.
It has the highest burden of lymphatic filariasis, accounting for 53% of global population requiring preventive chemotherapy.
The Region accounts for 74% of new leprosy cases reported globally, 41 per cent of global black fever cases and 42% of children who require preventive chemotherapy for soil-transmitted helminthes, the statement said.

Will Lankan hopes freeze in Jiashen
Asian Grand Prix 2017 second leg today:
The second leg of the Asian Grand Prix 2017 will commence here at the Jiashen Sports Complex, 98 kms away Shanghai, China. The temperature in Jiashen has dropped to 12 degrees Celsius yesterday and Lankan athletes were badly affected by the cold weather that greeted them.
They participated in two training sessions and Sri Lankan medal hopes at the second leg is at stake with the unfamiliar weather conditions.
The organizers have advised athletes not to eat chicken as a disease is spreading among the poultry farms in Jiashen. Sri Lanka team manageress Mrs. Badra Gunawardena said that the athletes are being provided with boiled water instead of bottled water to assure their safety.
The two injured Lankan athletes, Nimali Liyanarachchi (women's 800m) and Waruna Lakshan (men's Javelin throw) will take part in their events in the second leg, even though they have not fully recovered. Waruna has an ankle problem and Nimali has an injured left foot.
According to head coach Pradeep Nishantha, Waruna was injured during the first leg when he competed on the Mondo track which is totally different from Sri Lanka's synthetic tracks.
"The cool weather created a lot of problems in his grip and throw with the numbness. The javelin throw event will last for at least one and a half hours, so it is very difficult to keep the body warmed up in this weather. But Waruna is determined to fight against all these odds," Nishantha said.
On the bright side, Waruna's familiar Nemith javelin which the Technical Committee did not allow for him to use in the first leg has been permitted by the same committee and will be an advantage to Waruna.
Nimali's personnel coach Sujith Nilantha revealed that she is suffering from the injury for some time and she will be sent to Qatar soon after this meet to make customized running shoes as they have found the problem is with her shoes.
Nimali recorded a better timing a week before, and we have investigated the problem with a Thai physio. His advice was not to compete, but I need to observe her performance and asked her to take part, Nilantha said.

Last year too, Sri Lanka was placed on the same ranking. Thus the country marked no improvement or deterioration in relation to global press freedom rankings this year.
The World Press Freedom Index was published by the Reporters Without Borders, an international non-profit, non-governmental organisation that promotes and defends freedom of information and freedom of the press.
From 165th place in 2015, Sri Lanka moved 24 ranks up in 2016 to 141 and attributed this improvement to the change of Governments in early 2015.
Reporters Without Borders in its country specific analysis this year raised concerns over the Sri Lankan Governments call to register all news websites with the Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Ministry.
This vague and disproportionate directive immediately reminded the media and citizens and journalists of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas censorship methods it commented.
The new government also assured journalists that they would not be persecuted due to their political views or their coverage of sensitive subjects such as corruption and human rights violations by the military. However, an attack on journalist Freddy Gamage in June 2016 fuelled doubts of both the public and media freedom defenders it added.
The index has categorised countries as Good Situation, Satisfactory Situation, Noticeable Problem, Difficult Situation and Very Serious Situation as per their performance on the press freedom front . Out of these categories Sri Lanka falls into the category of Difficult Situation.
According to the Index released yesterday Norway ranked first and North Korea ranked last in terms of press freedom. The Reporters Without Boarders website also noted that a number of democracies including the US and the UK have fallen in the Index.
Donald Trumps rise to power in the United States and the Brexit campaign in the United Kingdom were marked by high-profile media bashing, a highly toxic anti-media discourse that drove the world into a new era of post-truth, disinformation, and fake news, it stated.

Bus Only lane to cover many roads in Colombo
The Bus Only lane will be extended to many parts of Colombo and the suburbs as it received Cabinet approval this week after its initial success in Rajagiriya.
The Bus Only lane provision would be made available during peak hours on roads of Moratuwa-Ratmalana, Wellawatte-Colpetty on the Galle road, from Parliament junction to Rajagiriya, Borella, Maradana, Pettah and Colombo Fort in Parliament Road, from the roundabout in Chittampalam A. Gardiner Mw to Pettah, Thummullah Junction to Museum Junction and Eye Hospital roundabout to Thummulla Junction.
The Bus Only lane has been put forward by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry as a suitable short term measure until other proposals such as the Light Rail Transit system and electrification of trains are implemented as part of the Megapolis to improve public transport.
A pilot project for the Bus Only lane was implemented from the Rajagiriya Junction to the Ayurveda junction from March 12-23. Results showed while the earlier measured speed of a vehicle during traffic between Borella to Welikada junction was 9.5km/hr during the trial, buses achieved speeds up to 20km/hr.
A survey by the University of Moratuwa revealed that over 50 percent of users indicated significant travel time savings, while 70 percent wanted the project to continue to permanency and over 60 percent wanted it extended to other roads.
The bus lane benefited more than 4O percent of the commuters even though it carried 5 percent of the vehicles.

Ex-CB governor made transfers with ulterior motive
It is fairy tale: Mahendrans Legal Counsel:
Former CBSL Governor Arjun Mahendran has made transfers with an ulterior motive following his appointment in 2015, evidence presented at the Presidential Commission suggested yesterday.
Former CBSL Governor Mahendrans Legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva, while objecting to the nature of evidence, said such a statement lacks credibility. It is a fairy tale meant for the gallery, he said.
De Silva said evidence is prejudicial.
A disagreement arose when Central Banks Human Resources Department former Director Kalyani Gunatilake was testifying at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
She was questioned on the major shuffling of Central Bank Department Heads by former Governor Mahendran as soon as he took office in 2015. It was revealed that 14 Heads of Departments were transferred by then Governor Mahendran.
Additional Solicitor General Yasantha Kodagoda justifying as to why he is presenting such evidence said that his position is based on investigative material collected by investigators and on interviews he has done with former HR Director Kalyani Gunatilake.
He said the shuffling of Department Heads has affected the Treasury Bond auction on February 27, 2015.
Mahendran to facilitate his interference with the decision making process and the practice of the Public Debt Department, had put in place an officer as the Head of the PDD, so that he could brush her aside and interfere with the decision making process, Kodagoda said.
Objecting to the implications by Kodagoda, legal counsel Silva said that a statement as this is meant for the gallery and the press. One must check the credibility of the statement, he said.

Blaze trophy returns to Randles Hills
It was an amazing rugby encounter when two brother schools Kingswood College, Kandy and Wesley College met each other last Saturday at Bogambara Stadium. It was a brilliant encounter with both teams playing some excellent rugby to the excitement of the spectators where the Kingswoodians regained the trophy.
Kingswood was able to take back the trophy with just a one point win (40-39). It was nice to see their former sports master Ruben Wijayawardene gracing the occasion as the chief guest and handing over the trophy. He was 15 years as MIC of rugger, and 2 years POG and was also the Tournament Secretary of Sri Lanka School Rugby and Central Province Schools Rugby secretary.
This trophy means a lot as it was introduced in 1986, where the old Kingswoodian late Roy de Silva, a well-known sporting figure when he was the president of the Kingswood OBA donated it. The inaugural game for the trophy took place on 17 July 1986 and it was won by Kingwood who was led by Ronnie Ibrahim. Wesley was led by Sumedha Kuruppu.
Thereafter it became an annual fixture and two games were played except for the period between 2006 and 2012, when the series was interrupted due to unwanted incident at a match, and thus it was made one leg.
Lewis Edmund Blaze was a product of Trinity College, the founder of Kingswood College on 4 May 1891. At that time the school was named Kandy Boys High School and he was the founder principal. Wesley College was founded on 2 March 1874 by Rev. Daniel Henry Pereira, with Rev. Samuel Rose Wilkin as its founder Principal. Kingswood was the first school to play rugby in 1893 during that time there was no school involved in the game and after Trinity College took up the game the first inter school game was between Kingswood and Trinity in 1906 which ended in a six-all draw. Wesley started rugby in 1955 with Eddie Buell as captain.
So, in last Saturdays game Kingswood and Wesley were equally superior in their type of play. Both schools, surprised everybody with their excellent display of run and passes rugby.
The Blaze trophy wining Kingswood team consisted of Heshan Jansen (captain), Lakshitha Ranaweera, Tharindu Oshada, Dimantha Weerasekara, Thavindu Siriwardana, Milan Weerasingha, Rimzan Alith, Rashmika Chandaratna, Shanuka Gedaragoda, Tharindu Waligampola, Hirushan Anuranga, Sachintha Seneviratne, Asiri Seneviratne, Sachintha Abeyratna, Ruchira Ekanayaka, Chathura Soysa, Thuwan Dilshan, Janitha Rajanayaka, Amantha Alwis, Dinesh Gamage - Coach and Indunil Wickramasinghe - trainer.

Chevron to produce Yamaha Genuine Oil
Chevron Lubricants Lanka announced a strategic partnership with Japans Yamaha Motor Company where Chevron will be producing Yamaha Genuine Oil under the brand Yamalube for the Sri Lankan market.
With similar arrangements in place between Yamaha Motor Company Japan and Chevron in various other markets, this represents a first for Sri Lanka where Yamalube 4 Stroke Motor Oil will be produced at the state of the art blending and manufacturing plant of Chevron Lubricants Lanka in Sapugaskanda.
Yamalube Oil is specifically meant for use in Yamaha Motor Cycles sold in the Sri Lankan market and is available in 2 viscosity grades of 10W-40 and 20W-40 conforming to API SL/JASO MA specifications.
Yamaha Motor Company officials Masakazu Suzuki and Mitsuru Masayasu were in Sri Lanka in 2016 for the audit of the Chevron Blending and Manufacturing Plant at Sapugaskanda and after an exhaustive check of systems and processes, cleared the plant as conforming to the high standards required by Yamaha Japan to manufacture their Genuine Oil.
We are pleased to partner with Chevron Sri Lanka in introducing Yamaha Genuine Oils for Yamaha Motor Cycles in Sri Lanka, in the same way that we work with them in several other Regional markets said Masakazu Suzuki, Manager  Yamalube Support Group, Overseas Marketing Division of Yamaha Motor Co., Ltd. Japan.
Kishu Gomes  Managing Director/CEO of Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC stated that the relatively new blending and manufacturing plant of Chevron Lubricants Lanka PLC built with an investment of US$ 15 Million in 2014 has a capacity of more than double the total market potential of Sri Lanka and was therefore also meant to cater to the demand of regional markets. Toll Blending for major OEMs such as Yamaha is therefore very much part of this vision added Gomes.
