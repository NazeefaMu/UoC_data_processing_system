Beware, he's active again!
The emergence of a new party within the SLFP has become the talking point of most, today. Although the parties of the United Opposition indicated their interest of a party lead by Mahinda, SLFP members were mostly silent. Leaders gave strong statements against dividing the party. President Maithripala Sirisena has said, sometimes people ask him whether he will not allow dividing the SLFP. He pointed out that if someone is attempting to divide the party and form a Front that is a treacherous act against the SLFP.
He said this in a meeting organized under the patronage of Nuwara Eliya SLFP Organizer C. B. Ratnayake. Speaking on the occasion the President said that he worked as the General Secretary of the SLFP for a long period of time and he would never attempt to divide the party. He further said that everyone should join to protect the party from those who try to divide the party, to gain narrow political mileage. On the other hand, at the same time, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa denied that the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) is divided and said that the reason he did not form his own party to contest the election is because he was not ready to abandon the SLFP for his personal gain.

When asked as to why he decided to contest the parliamentary polls and whether the UPFA is divided due to his decision, the ex-President responded saying: "I have come forward at the request of the majority of my party and the UPFA and most importantly the people of this country." "UPFA is not divided at all," he assured. While Maithri, talked about the unity of the SLFP; Mahinda emphasized on the unity of the UPFA.
New political party
Strangely enough the UPFA members such as VASU, Wimal who were categorized as left or socialist party leaders in the past, now have become the most violent patriots undermining the interest of the minority nationalities. Instead they have become the perpetrators of fascistic campaigns of Mahinda clan. Apparently the SLFP MPs supporting former President Mahinda Rajapaksa have been asked to refrain from talking about forming a new political party to contest the forthcoming Local Government election. However other members of the UPFA who supports Mahinda come out with statements in support of forming a party or front that includes them. This has been followed by the SLFP members too.
"We have realized that SLFP MPs issuing statements to media about forming a new political party will hinder our negotiations with the SLFP to work out a settlement. Therefore, the SLFP MPs representing the joint opposition were asked to keep mum on the matter. At the same time, there will be negotiations with the SLFP and the 'joint opposition' to arrive at a final agreement. Those discussions are aimed at preventing a split in the SLFP," a top-notch member of the 'joint opposition', formed by UPFA dissidents has stated. So this is conspiracy to undermine the leadership of Maithri and to draw the bulk of SLFP to the party created by the UPFA.
However, they have agreed that the other party leaders of the UPFA can talk about forming a new political party because they don't have any commitment to the present SLFP leadership.
Maithri supporters
The SLFP MPs supporting the former President will only talk about the new political party if Maithri refuses to accept their demands. The conspirators say that even the former President would not openly talk about forming a new political party, at this point. While this conspiracy is going ahead, speaking at a press conference held recently SLFP stalwart Minister S.B. Dissanayake said the party leadership would not be 'transferred' to the former President, at any cost. "If the former President leads the election, we will certainly face another defeat. But, I accept that our campaign needs his blessings," the Minister explained.
Many militants are deeply worried about what is happening. While Maithri supporters still believe to win elections by hiding behind the image of Mahinda and maintaining an artificial unity within the SLFP fascistic elements is busy undermining the leadership of Maithri. Today the problem within the SLFP has become the disturbing problem of the government. Many drums started to beet! Forming a new party is unavoidable, says former minister Basil.

Navy-Havies could be a thriller
The confrontation between Havelocks SC and Sri Lanka Navy in the Dialog 'A' Division League Rugby Championship second round match at Havelock Park today at 6:30 pm under lights will turn out to be a thriller.
Havelocks will miss the services of experienced national fly half Dulaj Perera due to a serious knee injury which has ruled him out for the season. His place will be taken by ex-Navy fly half Samantha Lakshan. Burly lock forward Jason Meldor is a doubtful starter due to injury and if he does not play Sithum Peiris will fill in the vacant berth.
The forte of both teams has been their power-packed forwards. The Navy 'eight' especially ex-national captain Yoshitha Rajapaksa, Dulanjana Wijesinghe, Danushka Perera, Sajith Saranga and Sathya Ranatunga have to give a terrific display in the loose and secure ball position if they have to pull this game through because the Navy will be given a torrid time by the Park club forwards spearheaded by burly Ganuka Dissanayaka and ably supported by Dushmantha Priyadarshana, Umesh Madushan, Melder, Rohitha Rajapaksa and Muthuthanththri.
Two more matches today
Two other Dialog A division second round matches will be played today with CR & FC hosting CH & FC at Longden Place and Air Force v Sri Lanka Army at Ratmalana.
Police-Kandy a close tussle
The confrontation between Kandy SC and Sri Lanka Police at Nittawela grounds tomorrow (Sunday) should turn out to be a closed game. Kick off at 4:00 pm.
The Policemen who suffered an unexpected defeat at the hands of Navy in their first round game came back to their normal pattern of play against them in their second round where they registered a shock 16-11 victory. Police have been training hard during the last few days and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win while the Kandy side which registered run away victory's against Air Force by 60 -16 last week will have to be at their very best if they have to beat the high riding Policemen. Going by the two team's performance so far a close tussle for supremacy can be expected.
Kandy will miss the services of their experienced skipper and national captain Fazil Marija due to a serious back injury. His place will be taken by former CR and FC fly half Nigel Ratwatte.
The forte of Police team has been their power-packed forwards. The Police 'eight' especially Bilal Hassan, Sharo Fernando, Terence Henry, Joel Perera, Achala Perera and Radeesha Ranjan have given a terrific display in the loose but they will come up against the Kandy forwards spearheaded by burly Buwaneka Udangamuwa and Heshan Kalhara ably supported by Soyuru Anthony, Kishore Jehan, Damith Dissanayaka, Piyumal Manchanayaka and Gayan Ratnayaka.
In the set scrums experienced Police hooker Achala Perera should get the better of his vis-a-vis Damith Dissanayaka while the line outs should be shared between the Police duo of Archirige and Sharo and Kandy's Soyuru Anthony and Gayan Ratnayaka.
With the new halves combination of Sudam Sooriyarachchi and Mohamad Sheriff having clicked in the last match the Policemen will hope that Sooriyarachchi will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Mohamad Abzal and Musheen Faleel. In addition there are experienced wingers Chula Susantha and young Reeza Rafaideen who has stood out with their powerful runs down the flank along with their full back Reeza Mubarak often joining the line to form the overlap.

No one is above the law
'A Judge needs courage. Judges with courage resist threats to judicial independence and actively advocate such. We must foster a culture that support and rewards courageous judges.' Duhaime's very profound yet 'gone out of gear' utterance in the Sri Lankan context was brought to this writer's mind when the Homagama Magistrate made a rather unusually bold pronouncement that the army commander would be arrested should he interfere in the case of journalist Eknaligoda's investigations.
At the time these lines are being penned, Judge Dissanayake has resorted to a moral explosion again in ordering the arrest of BBS kingpin Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera.
In a country of fallen standards, eroding values and very lackadaisical unprofessional behaviour, this judicial brilliance deserves nothing less than a standing ovation for it endangers his life and it comes as a result of selflessness. Finding such professional eminence in this country is akin to getting a needle off a haystack going by the moral deviance which has been our 'feed' since the so-called dawn of independence.
Very often we hear at seminars and workshops, failed, retired government servants' famous escape line,"what to do. I was helpless in the matter. There was no alternative for me except to agree." This no doubt is to make 'chicken feed' of one's self to the deities of power. Contrastingly, the Homagama Magistrate risks not only his bread and life but his family's as well. Media concern over such is poor as Presidents, Ministers, Prime Ministers, bomb explosions, how many killed and how many wounded are prioritized for public consumption. Sensational journalism and elitist journalism go to fill newspaper pages while very little or no effort at all is the unfair share allocated to developmental journalism. The Magistrate's story falling into the last category which should have been prime media pick for at least a few days, did not get the attention it so richly deserves.
Magistrate's bold and upright stand
Failure on the part of media warrants public participation in the matter. Protest marches alone would not suffice. Highlighting individual performance of professional brilliance in public interest is absolutely nil in this country as evident in the magistrate's bold and upright stand and the media's failure to centerpiece its significance does not augur well. Had civil society gone to town in highlighting that kind of legal brilliance, the message of what the public expect from professionals would have rung out in no mean way.
This is not to underestimate the effort, even though of late, the positive street protests so far unheard of in this country in the face of what is irregular. The rise of civil society and the awakening of academics are contributory factors in spearheading yahapalanaya. Renowned Sinhala scholar Professor Sarath Wijeysuriya on whom the leadership mantle of the National Movement for Social Justice fell, following Ven. Sobitha Thera's demise, has done well in expressing certain unpalatable views, of course with some back patting when needed. Professor Siri Hettige on whom the spotlight falls for moral clearance of police discrepancies maintains he would rather go home than be seen pushed around by political nincomputes. "In fairness to them this has not happened so far and I'm still around," he says. Contrastingly, G.L. Peiris was a total moral failure for his servility in upholding a corrupt status quo. Not even a semblance of intellectual brilliance was to his credit though ironically a Rhodes scholar _ silence being his preferred state in instances of misdemeanour.
The people's sovereignty is upheld when a public servant challenges administrative irregularities _ it's realization only possible in an environment of freedom as we find now. For how long the newly found freedom will continue, only time will tell. Yet this alone will not suffice. Public servants challenging the status quo need to be appreciated though a leading academic saw it as worthless upon which this writer asked him whether to appreciate is not part of a cultured mind. My question only met with a deafening silence.
Judicial supremacy
One single swallow does not make a summer. Nevertheless, that a single whistle blower's inspiration would signal many others' entry into the moral domain is well worth waiting in anticipation. However, devoid of civil society and media interest in the matter, a positive outcome is least expected. Yet, an essential component in activating civil society is the media _ the prime informing agent.
The much preferred line of traditional media gurus of the orthodox, conventional, outdated brigade was, "when dog bites man it is not news but when man bites dog it is news." Yet who chews what was regrettably not of their concern. A constant thirst for sensationalism of a negative nature was their taste and delight but not so the focus into a moral society. We have not come very far in changing the face of modern journalism into a proactive, vibrant state. The old mentors' theories still do languish without any effort into media vibrancy. If it was so, Judge Dissanayake's judicial chivalry would not be at a dead end.
Some may feel as did that academic pundit, that the gentleman Judge was merely doing his duty and there was no need for such acts to be highlighted. Perhaps, 'yes' in countries where high standards are upheld, Judge Dissanayake's act is a common occurrence and media exposure is redundant. Yet, in many Asian countries including Sri Lanka such whistle blowing needs much trumpeting for their indefatigable capacity in the realms of corruption and other moral deviance.
In India and Pakistan, judicial swiftness has even prime caused into bringing down powerful governments. India's one time Chief Justice Bhagwati's contribution in torch bearing an evolved judiciary in that country is not unknown. In a Colombo based gathering 20 years ago where the large numbers present outdid the hall's physical space, he spoke on the spirit of the law so far unheard of in this country.
Had Neville Samarakoon, one time chief justice been living, Judge Dissanyake's judicial valour would have come in for much praise. Samarakoon, though J.R. Jayewardene's choice into that seat, refused the latter's summoning to be at Braemar and insisted the president meet him instead. Those were the high standards he maintained in judicial supremacy.
Politicians will always be in disrepute for their inability to win public confidence. Take for instance nepotism or family bandyism. Politicians are inclined into it because of the callous disregard for feelings of the country's citizenry. They will unceasingly remain corrupt which is why people disregard them as a bunch of crooks. Elections and a change of government is not the way out.
If so who will beard the lion in it's den. The three pronged attack rests with a fearless judiciary, a vibrant civil society and a team of enlightened academics who will demand from the lawmakers who have fallen from grace into being law breakers, good governance and righteous rule to rid this country from the labyrinth of disaster.
Judge Dissanayake no doubt has made a good start and the public surely will regain their lost confidence in the judiciary. His ruling as against Sarath Silva the former Chief Justice whose judgemental favour towards Rajapaksa was public confession sometime back, erodes people's faith in the judiciary. Gnanasara Thera was right when he spoke of the law's unequal treatment, but he chose the wrong venue to argue a strong point. He ought to have known better.

PM leads battle against rise of yellow terror
The Homagama Magistrate's Court emerged as the centre of a necessary fight against the rise of a wave of racial-religious terror that has the support of key opposition forces, and posing a major threat to the country's judicial system, too.
Only a few weeks ago the Homagama Magistrate ordered the Army Commander to extend fullest cooperation to the Police in investigations into the case of the missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda. The same Court has now had to order the detention in remand of the leader and General Secretary of the Budu Bala Sena (BBS) Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera, and ensure protection of the Court premises from the robed, robe removed, and lay persons who are demonstrating a swell of terror, fanned by racial and religious extremist forces, having the fullest backing of the opposition ranged against attempts by the government of consensus to take the country forward through reconciliation, understanding and accountability.
Responding to the show of this wave of terror at the Homagama Magistrate's Court earlier this week, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe made a timely and valued statement in Parliament that there will be no room for another Somarama or Buddharakkitha in the country. The necessity to recall the assassination of Prime Minister SWRD Bandaranaike, a popularly elected leader of the country by yellow robes persons, so described by the fatally injured Mr. Bandaranaike himself, shows the danger that lurks with extremist forces seeking to gain control and give direction to sections of the Maha Sangha.
The new danger
Welcoming the Prime Minister's decision to prevent a Somarama-Buddharakkitha situation, and his orders to the Police to fully probe the activities of the BBS leader, it is necessary to record that what took place in the Bandaranaike assassination was an internal conspiracy over business interests with political connections; while, what is coming up in this new wave of terror is a clear attempt to push people politics into the arms of religious-racist extremism, which was clearly encouraged by the defeated Rajapaksa regime; with no room for doubt that the brother of the former President, former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, was very close to and supportive of the BBS and its activities.
Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera
The previous regime took no action whatever against the BBS, Ravana Balaya and related forces in the violence against Muslims they provoked at Aluthgama and Beruwela in mid-2014, as well as against Christian organizations, and also the disruptive action they took in forcible entry to State institutions, threatening administrators and disrupting the functioning of those institutions. The only response was the joke of a Religious Police Unit being set up, which religiously avoided any confrontation with these dangerous forces.
Diverse threats
It is important to note that the timing of the BBS-led contempt of court and threat to the judiciary, and the near coincident Dalada Maligawa pledge by the "Sinha-le" movement, comes with the emerging interest in Sri Lanka as a new location for foreign investment in South Asia.
The discussions at Davos led by Prime Minister Wickremesinghe, and the country's new trends in democracy, rule of law and economic policies, have shown key investors such as Microsoft, Richard Branson's Virgin Group, George Soros related institutions and many European companies, to show an interest in direct investment in Sri Lanka. The rise of the new extremist wave can be seen as an attempt to prevent such investment coming to the country, through the bad image of racist or religious violence given to the world, in line with efforts of the defeated Rajapaksa forces to prevent much needed economic recovery in the country.
Also related is the comment by the BBS leader in his tirade at the Homagama Magistrate's Court that they had no respect for the white man's judicial system that is followed, which stands out as a major threat to the progress of the Rule of Law in the country, and the welcome signs of the new independence of the Judiciary seen in several recent court decisions. Interestingly, this threat of "yellow robed" terror comes amidst the debate on the proposed Theravada Kathikavatha Bill.
The SLFP divisions
The political cartoons in most media are the best indications of the crisis strongly threatening the unity of the SLFP today. This situation is underscored by comments from SLFP groups in the Government and the Opposition, and especially from those realizing the inevitability of a break away from the party, under some Rajapaksa leadership.
Mahinda Rajapaksa (MR), weakly waving the SLFP flag stating he will never be a "party breaker", is causing a burden for the Joint Opposition loud mouths Wimal Weerawansa, Udaya Gammanpila and cabal. Meanwhile, there is a clear inner Rajapaksa family contest for leadership of any new political alignment from an SLFP split. Basil Rajapaksa, having lost much support within the SLFP, on his bad record as SLFP National Organizer, leading to MR defeat on January 8, is certainly making a claim for leadership, in keeping with his record in political machinations and party jumping in the past. However, the stronger contender seems to be Gotabhaya, with his absence of a political record, and his standing as a "War Hero", and clear supporter of extreme Sinhala-Buddhist thinking.
BBS and 'Sinha-le'
The new rise of the BBS, and the "Sinha-le" waving the "Sinhala" flag, waved when Gotabhaya was first called to a Commission of Inquiry after January 8, shows the forces ranged in his support, mainly the extremist forces trying to make the best use of the so-called threats to War Heroes, as in the Ekneligoda and certain other cases today; best demonstrated by the BBS at the Homagama Magistrate's Court, the "Sinha-le" clashes with Police near the Dalada Maligawa and extreme anti-Muslim provocation at Mawanella, earlier this week.
Gotabhaya has reminded pro-splitters in the SLFP of the paternal history in party splitting, when DA Rajapaksa, left the UNP Government with SWRD Bandaranaike to form the SLFP in 1952. He thus sees a good family tradition in party splitting and is even posing a challenge to MR, who makes less sound about any support for a breakaway. There is less said about Mr. Bandaranaike's expressed surprise that DA Rajapaksa had indeed followed him in that crossover to the Opposition.
What is most likely to emerge is a break away from the SLFP, with some arrangements where MR will possibly remain within to look after the interests of his own family and those of his siblings, even in political rivalry; with his support for a Maithripala Sirisena leadership of the SLFP. It will be an interesting display of sharing family responsibilities on crime, fraud and corruption.
The Sailor inspiration
Amidst speculation about Lt. Yoshitha Rajapaksa, the second son of MR being called before a military court for alleged violations of the Navy Act, there is an interesting aspect about his recruitment to the Navy, without necessary educational qualifications for the rank he was hired, but costing the State more than Rs. 200 million on training abroad.
Minister for Media and Information, Gayantha Karunatilake, informed Parliament that Yoshitha may have been recruited to that rank, even without qualifications, being the then President's son, and possibly to encourage other youth to join the Navy, in need of manpower at the time, in December 2006. It's possible his entry to the Navy may have inspired some youth to join it at the time of war.
Yet, what is more significant is that this "inspiring force" did no service whatever in the area of conflict in the country, but spent more than three years, till the war against the LTTE was over, training abroad - in the UK and Ukraine at public expense; while many of those he may have "inspired" would have been the victims and even heroes of war.
Women's power
Departing from the turmoil of politics, the Prime Minister made important proposals on increasing women's representation in politics and governance, speaking as Chief Guest at the Ninth Sisters of St. Margaret Oration, celebrating Founders Day of his first school, Bishop's College, Colombo, on Wednesday.
He was concerned that although women were widely represented in all professions, public and social services, the numbers in governance, both national and local were very small. Parliament had only 11 women MPs when the population has over 50 % of women. His initial proposal was bringing women to local government, through a Women's List, similar to the National list for Parliament, ensuring 20 to 25% representation in Local Government bodies, based on percentage polled by respective parties. He expected this to progress towards better female representation in Parliament. Importantly, he also called on women's activists to ensure better promotions of women to the directorates of companies in the private sector.
His proposals, timely amidst the debate on constitutional reform, showed commitment to bringing capable women, into the field of politics and governance, to strengthen democracy, and paved the way for a good debate on aspects of gender equality, and matters of domestic violence that are of rising concern today.
