Three-wheeler drivers influence society considerably
Today, the three-wheeler drivers profession is one that can make a considerable influence on society. At present there are about 1.5 million people engaged in this profession. If you take this as an industry, there are around 4 million people who are direct contributors to it, said Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha.
He made these observations at the All-Island Federation of Professional Three-wheeler Service Providers held at the Colombo Public Library auditorium. Here, attention was drawn in regulating three-wheeler drivers by issuing identity cards and registering three-wheeler drivers in relevant districts.
"We should protect this mode of transport which is closed to the hearts of the middle-class community. Because of the faults of few, the entire field is being ostracized. However, that is far from the truth. As a government, it is our duty to safe guard this industry. These three-wheelers provide a huge service in the rural areas," he added.
"Today, in all parts of the country, including the poorer districts, there are a large number of three-wheelers. They not only transport passengers, they also transport goods. Because of this, we have to protect this industry which is wide spread all over Sri Lanka. We have to take into consideration, the safety of the clients who use the services of these three-wheelers. As a government, we have to ensure the safety of both parties," the minister said.
Minister Musthapha said, "It is wrong to think that the children of three-wheeler drivers should continue their fathers' footsteps. All fields of employments in this society are open to their children. Similarly, I would like to request something form you all. That is to follow the rules of the road. I am requesting you all to establish a disciplined industry."

The Minister also said his appointment was a great honour for Sri Lanka. He also spoke on the proposals of the UNWTO and said those proposals would be of immense benefit for developing the tourism industry in Sri Lanka.

Aitken Spence Hotels  pay tribute to 150 years of Ceylon tea
Celebrating the perennial connection between Sri Lanka and Ceylon tea dating back to 150 years, premier hospitality chain Aitken Spence Hotels hosted a unique concept event on Thursday, September 14, at its Vauxhall Street head office, with over 300 guests in attendance.
Completely transforming the corporate atmosphere, Aitken Spence Hotels, in their customary innovative spirit, brought Nuwara Eliya to Colombo, creating an epic journey to the hills complete with sights, sounds and views. Invitees started their experience with a rail ride from Fort to Nanu Oya, arriving at a beautiful walkway through tea plantations leading to the entrance of Heritance Tea Factory, all whilst in Colombo 2.
Signature brews specially made to be blended with curated tea infused concoctions and delightful sweet and savory nibbles with a twist to truly Sri Lankan flavours were created by Aitken Spence Hotels talented and award winning culinary teams  led by F&B Corporate Director two-Michelin star chef Bjorn Van Der Host and Culinary Brand Ambassador and Culinary Olympics gold medalist Chef Dimuthu Kumarasinghe  which added to the overall experience.
In celebrating the legacy that started with James Taylor and his experiment along the margins of his coffee plantation divisional roads, the guests were treated to a surprise entrance by a good old fashion bombai mottai man, doing the rounds with his tin box, drawing memories of an era gone by.
The event also acted as a platform for the Group to thank their valued stakeholders for their unstinted support during the past years whilst looking forward to a future that will mirror past successes combined with new milestones and achievements.
Speaking at the event on behalf of the management, Director of Aitken Spence PLC and Chairperson of Aitken Spence Hotel Managements (Pvt) Ltd, Stasshani Jayawardena noted that as a truly Sri Lankan hospitality brand that looks at carrying the virtues of Sri Lankan culture and its interlaced values to the world through its brands of hotels, the momentous occasion of Ceylon teas success through 150 glorious years is one well worth celebrating.
While tea is part and parcel of Sri Lanka and its identity in the world, it has influenced our business as well. One of our premier hotels, Heritance Tea Factory is a unique property that is converted from a 19th century tea factory constructed in the days of the British Raj.
The hotel has been featured in many local and international forums as a unique holiday resort and we are very proud of having such a property, which was the brainchild of G.C. Wickremasinghe as part of our portfolio. As such, it gave us an impetus to share in this national celebration of its legendary journey in tea, Jayawardena said.
The eminent guest list included ambassadors, personnel from the Tourism Board and Ministry, heads of banks, celebrity chefs such as Chef Martin Yan of Yan Can Cook fame, members from the Emirates Culinary Academy, longstanding Diamond Club members, influencers, corporate and sales partners, guests and media.

By October 26, new vocational subjects would be introduced for G.C.E./Ordinary Level failures to take them upto the GCE Advanced Level Examinations. Furthermore, an insurance cover upto Rs.500,000 would be introduced for the school going population comprising nearly 4.5 million children from October this year. If a student is hospitalised for a sickness he or she would receive Rs.1000 daily for 30 days totalling Rs.30,000 in respect of a government hospital or upto Rs 100000 in respect of a private hospital.

Meanwhile, Perpetual Treasuries Limited Chief Executive Officer Kasun Palisena testified before the Commission yesterday. PTL lawyers Presidents Counsel Nihal Fernando, Romali Thudawe and Neranjan Arunpragasam re-examined the witness arguing against the cross-examination carried over by the Attorney Generals Department of Palisena.

Arjuna Mahendran arrives before PCoI - UPDATED

Former Governor of the Central Bank Arjuna Mahendran testified today before the Treasury Bond Commission with regards to the questioned 27 February 2015 auction as well as the 29, 31 March 2016 auctions, which are under the scrutiny of the Commission.
Mahendrans position was that he was in fully agreement with the Tender Board decision taken on the 27 February 2015 auction to accept 10.5 billion bids.
He also disagreed with the Auditor Generals position that a loss was incurred by the government at the said auction.
Mahendran also expressed his disagreement with Auditor Generals loss calculation in his special audit report on the Treasury bond issue.
Mahendran also stated that he was not involved in the decision-making processes of 29 and 31 March 2016 auctions, under Commissions probe.
Legal Representative of former Governor Mahendran, Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva made a submission reserving their right to withdraw from giving evidence at any point that his client was not treated with dignity and fairness.
De Silva PC pointed that Mahendran is not legally inclined to testify before the Commission, as he is not a citizen of Sri Lanka.
Mahendran gave evidence before the Commission on changes he made at the Central Bank when he was appointed as the Governor and also rationalized why he thought public auction was a better method to raise debts more than private placement method.
He also gave evidence on the decision-making process of the 27 February 2015 auction. He also gave reasons for walking into a Market Operations Committee on the same day morning, which was chaired by Deputy Governor Dr. Nandalaal Weerasinghe.
Mahendran said following his appointment, he wanted to address serious issues in the Central Bank, which has caused the CBSL to incur losses up to Rs. 39 billion in 2013-2014 years.
Speaking of the backdrop at which the 27 February 2015 auction was held, Mahendran said the biggest economic issue the newly-appointed government faced in 2015 was the large debts it had to service.
For March 2015, the government requirement was Rs. 72 billion, which was a large sum of money, and drastic actions were necessary to meet the demand, Mahendran said.

Australian cricket anecdotes - Gideon Haig
At present our cricket has hit such a low that even the elderly ladies who have not seen a bat or ball all their lives start questioning our fraternity, to explain the nuances of cricket to them, is the most difficult and frustrating thing on earth, as a result to divert their minds to more familiar grounds to them, I normally deflect their minds to their new hairstyles or make up etc and my success rate has been more than 90%. These days each and every one has joined this band wagon of criticizing the higher ups but let us stop this and think constructively and hope everything should fall into place eventually, not all is lost and at least we should think that way to ease the depression that is enveloping our minds. So to take my readers feel more tranquil in mind I would delve back to the Australian Cricket Anecdotes. So here we go.
LAST MAN STANDING
Australian hopes in the Fourth Test of the 1882-83 Ashes series at the MCG ended up hinging on a last wicket alliance of tailender Jeff Thomson and Allan Border, whose form to that stage had been wretched. But the former stuck round and Borders form steadily returned when Englands skipper Bob Willis decided to concede him singles.
Counselling his colleague through the days last 45 mts, Border began relishing Englands misdirection: When the partnership had started the Poms had been full of the joy of living. By stumps they were showing a little strain.----
The sight of 10,000 queuing for a day that could end in a ball cheered Border and Thomson next morning - 44 and 8 respectively - as they performed ritual nets.
Willis plan remained to defend against Border but, as the scoreboard flashed and the most frugal over, the run requirement at thirty second intervals and a second new ball was survived, confused fielders began colliding.
With the crowd 20,000 just after noon and the target reduced to a single stroke, Willis bowled his fiercest and most frugal over with Border on 60. The left hander glanced a couple to deep fine leg but could not appropriate the strike for Bothams 26th over. Mid -pitch conferences at 12.20 pm confirmed the air of imminent decision and Thomson took fresh guard pondering the possibility of a boundary.
Border recalls the next few seconds and the uncanny collaboration of Botham and slips men Tavare and Miller with clarity. When he hit it my initial reaction was that it was going over the top and for four. Then I thought its in Tavares hands and we are gone. And when it bounced out of his hands I thought: beauty we are back in it. Then all of a sudden, Miller was there. England had won by three runs.
Border recalled Marshs dressing room prowl-peering beneath kits, behind doors and in lockers-and its explanations: I am looking for four runs. The atmosphere was no better. Wrote Allan Lamb: I know callers expected to witness scenes of absolute mayhem with England cricketers dancing with delight knocking back champagne as if Australia was going to run out of the stuff any moment. Instead even half an hour after the match has finished they found the room like a morgue--- most of us sat around staring into the space hardly saying a word. Now and again one make a move towards the shower and get changed.- The Border Years (Hughes) pp 54-6
AN EARLY NIGHT
Victorian Dean Jones was selected to make his first Australian tour with Kim Hughes team visiting the West Indies in February 1984, and was quickly reminded of his junior status as the First Test approached. Three days before the Test I was rooming with Geoff Lawson who had sinus trouble or something. It was 8.00pm and we were watching TV, when, stuff me, when he gets up and switches off the set. Not a word. When I asked him what he was going on he said: Ive got a Test Match to play in a couple of days so I am going to have some sleep.
Ill always go along with professionalism but it was 14 hours before we had to turn up for training. But that was it; kicked out I had to go and find another room.
HE PASSED AWAY
Hughes found the various rumours of Rodney Hogg problematical, notably when he found 12th man Carl Rackemann fielding in a tour match apparently substituting for South Australia.
Hoggys gone off, said Rackemann.
What do you mean off asked Hughes. He didnt tell me. Go and find out where he is.
Big Carl returned to the field soon after, smiling, and said; He told me to tell you, captain that hes passed away.
This wasnt good enoughfor Kim naturally and he sent Carl again to retrieve Hogg. When Rackemann returned Hughes again asked after Hoggs whereabouts and Rackemann said: He told me to tell you that he has gone for a drive.
This was understandably too much for Hughes who promptly found his errant fast bowler in the dressing room and ordered him back on to the field quickly. - Hookesy (Hookes. page 116)

Awe-inspiring Architecture
An exhibition on the work of Sri Lankas master architects Geoffrey Bawa and Valentine Gunasekera titled Architectural Modernism in Sri Lanka: Geoffrey Bawa  Valentine Gunasekera, hosted by the Asia Culture Center (ACC) and produced by the Asia Culture Institute (ACI) in Gwangju, was inaugurated at the ACC in Gwangju on August 31. The exhibition which also celebrates 40 years of diplomatic relations between Sri Lanka and the Republic of Korea, was inaugurated by the Acting President of the ACC Bang Sun-gyu, in the presence of Sri Lankas Ambassador to the Republic of Korea Manisha Gunasekera; the President of the ACI Kim Byeong Seok, the Superintendent of the Gwangju Metropolitan Office of Education Jang Hwi-guk, and other distinguished invitees and attendees.
The exhibition was curated by Sri Lankan architect Dr. Nishan Wijetunge who provided an introduction to the work of the two master architects, Goeffrey Bawa and Valentine Gunasekera, as well as the impact of their work on architectural modernism in Sri Lanka and Asia. While both Bawa and Gunasekera had their architectural upbringing rooted in mid-20th century modernism, Curator Wijetunge pointed to the fundamentally different architectural styles that they adopted.
Ambassador Gunasekera welcomed the holding of the exhibition in Korea and thanked the ACC, the ACI, the curators and the organisers for putting together an informative and inspiring exhibition. She observed that Geoffrey Bawa is today regarded as one of the most influential Asian architects of the twentieth century, and that his work on tropical modernism has inspired modernist architecture in Sri Lanka and Asia. She noted that the work of Bawa and Gunasekera can be viewed as representative of modern Sri Lanka and its cosmopolitanism, embodying a blend of the countrys indigenous traditions as well as its colonial and post-colonial heritage. Looking at Bawa from the vantage point of Korea, the Ambassador observed that his minimalist aesthetic and spatial arrangements resonate with and demonstrate an affinity with East Asia.
The exhibition is unique in using VR media to provide the visitors with a virtual experience of the work of the two architects, in addition to photographs, models and other installations. The exhibition will continue at the ACC until October 29. During the visit to the ACC, the Ambassador and staff of the Embassy also viewed the exhibition space of artist Samvarthini Gunaseharam from Northern Sri Lanka at the 2017 ACC Arts Space Network.
The Embassy of Sri Lanka in the Republic of Korea and the organisers were deeply saddened to receive the news of the passing away of architect Valentine Gunasekera on September 4 in Sacramento, California, a few days after the inauguration of the exhibition. The exhibition in this context gains greater significance as a serious appreciation of Gunasekeras work, aesthetic and legacy.

Bulges wobbles and bubble butt troubles
Leg-hugging strides may be the pinnacle in pants fashion, but skinny jeans are likely to be squeezing their male hosts too tight in a particularly sensitive area, new medical research shows. British researchers warn that skinny jeans are responsible for the occurrence of health problems around the groin.
The skinny jean has been linked to inflictions including low sperm counts, twisted gonads, bladder weakness, urinary tract infections and fungal irritations, according to the research reports. Which effectually means that men encased in extremely tight pants greatly reduce their chances of fathering children. If an adult man wears tight pants all the time, it will keep him bunched up, so to say.
The ones in tight pants will remain fruitless while the ones with comfortable tailored pants remain heir-conditioned. Oh, the insufferable cruelty of tight jeans. Some sadistic, voyeuristic designer out there should be charged with the tyranny of discomfort. Hey, arent you tired of trying to shoe-horn yourself into tight little jeans Dont you feel that the world of fashion is decidedly strait-jacketing your nether regions and you are paying for the ache and discomfiting torture
Now, the logical thing to do is to base most of our fashion sense on what doesnt pinch, itch or tickle. After years of giving it some thought I have figured out with brilliant perception how they squirm into their tight pants. Rationally speaking they must start with a left leg wiggle, a jump and a squat. Then resort to a right leg wiggle, another jump, and a heck of a stretch. Then scream ouch on a couch and youre done!
But somehow, many of you, both sexes included, have all decided that smashing yourselves into jeans is really pretty awesome. This needs to stop. I mean, at what age is it okay for a woman to stop warring with her womanly curves I am dead weary of watching women fighting their curves.
And then come a different type of pants. You know, the kind that inspired me to coin the phrase that people in low-rise pants have recessive jeans. Sure, they might be in among rappers and gangstas, but sagging pants on most people are just gross. No one wants to see the parts of your body you should be keeping covered under those jeans. Once thought of as a fashion faux-pas, shockingly, now some people actually wear their pants like this on purpose. If you are not in a hip-hop group, buy yourself a decent belt and hike up those pants, please!
We all can appreciate a good body in tight jeans. However, some jeans, pants or shorts are simply too tight, leaving nothing to the imagination, or making even the most fit people look like a sausage. If you have to lie down and suck in your gut every time you put on your favourite pair of jeans, chances are they should no longer be your favourites. Ever heard of a nasty term that has to do with exposing in outline a womans womanliness And guys, in the name of everything thats holy keep your pants on at a decent level. We do not need to be able to see what religious denomination you belong to.
Thanks and God bless you. As long as you are reasonably shaped and you have mostly straight lines, you can rock the look. Still skinny jeans should not look like denim pantyhose! They resemble unmentionables, those articles of ladies apparel that are never discussed in public, except in full-page, illustrated ads. Hear, hear people! We do not need our men looking like they have sausage casings on.
Leave the skin tight jeans for your girlfriends and sisters please. They should sit just below your waist and have enough room in the legs, butt and crotch area. Think less skinny, more slim, with just a slight little taper at the ankles. Buy your jeans a size larger and wash them a few times to get a good fit. Do not wear your skinny jeans or pants below your butt. It is not sexy. It makes you look like toothpaste being squeezed out of the tube and might inspire some uncharitable types to call you Butthead!
For one thing it is uncomfortable. Come to think of it, I do not deserve the punishing view of you overflowing your denim or pants either. Look, no one likes to see such a brimful of flab spilling out of anybodys body. No one wants an eyeful of your jelly belly or your blacmanging bottom either. Besides, as mentioned for the male wearer there is the danger of cutting off your circulation to a vital part of your anatomy. And one for those chunkier dames out there: Dont you think that wearing jeans must just feel like such a cruel thing to do to your childbearing hips.
Then we observe the ridiculous ripped jeans trend, always an unusual choice of garb that beggars belief that people actually seem bent on imitating the impoverished vagrant look. The question is how much did you pay for a torn garment to look like the victim in a runaway lawnmower hit-and-run case
What you really need to do is to dress for comfort with clothes that provide the ease of movement and allow for breathable breeziness. Slightly looser well- tailored pants have that air of swooshability about them because no matter which way you move, you are covered - no crack, no bulging bum-bums, no patti-whack!
At church Sunday services women in excessively tight pants are certainly a distraction. Not because of any sensual thoughts but because the rest of the congregation I believe, fear for the wearers modesty. Each time they kneel their rear view fellow worshippers pray that the trouser material encasing their sagging bottoms would be able to withstand the bulging pressure. Those tight pants are at times so darned taut, that many could hardly breathe simply being forced to look at them.
Fortunately, so far prayers appear to have been answered. There have been no ominous ripping sounds. The materials have not split asunder and bottomed out. Thanks to what only could have been divine intercession sparing the congregation bare bottomous viewings.
As for the constrictive male nether garments, all I can say in their defence is that the term egotistical may be an apt description of the wearers vanity. But hold on! It has absolutely nothing to do with any phrase that helps accentuate any free-wheeling bulges they choose to flaunt in skin-tight pants.

Cancer on the rise in Sri Lanka: 17,000 new patients detected annually

All types of cancers are on the rise in Sri Lanka with around 17,000 new cancer patients detected annually by the local health system, National Cancer Control Programme Director Consultant Community Physician Dr. Sudath Samaraweera said.
Addressing a media workshop in Colombo today Dr. Samaraweera said the most common cancer among Sri Lankans is oral cancer, while with women it is breast cancer, with around 2,500 new breast cancer patients detected annually.
Consultant Community Physician Dr. Nayana De Alwis said that daily around seven new breast cancer patients are being detected in Sri Lanka with most of them in the stages three or four, which cannot be reversed.
The doctor said that early detection was imperative to survival and requested the public to screen themselves regularly at cancer detection centers.

Cases of those arrested under PTA will be heard soon: Swaminathan
The Attorney Generals Department will take steps to expedite the cases of those arrested under the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA), Prison Reforms, Resettlement and Rehabilitation Minister D. M. Swaminathan yesterday said.
The Minister addressing the National Prisoners Day celebrations held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute explained that the Attorney General had assured him that steps are being taken to deal with 73 cases filed under the PTA.
The AG said they would push for these cases to be heard on a daily basis and if there were any postponements, they should be no longer than two weeks, Minister Swaminathan said.
The cases will be finished at the earliest, he said.
The National Prisoners Day commemorated by the Prisoners Welfare Association together with the Prisons Department had many cultural performances put forward by the prisoners. The Prisoners Welfare Association, which celebrated 100 years this year, also awarded scholarships to children of prisoners.
The Minister took the opportunity to highlight the need to reintegrate prisoners into mainstream society once they leave prison. He asked that businesses hire them and that society accept them as rehabilitated individuals.
Swaminathan highlighting weaknesses within the Prison Department, said he could not tackle the long ingrained corruption within the Department overnight.
There is something radically wrong when prisoners start escaping prison, the Minister said as he admitted that they had serious shortage of staff which makes things harder to handle.
We have to fill some 600 odd vacancies and we are working on that and if the Ministry of Finance agrees, we will fill them as soon as possible, he said.

Cocoon Resort & Villas focuses on going green
In a day and age where going green is limited to a marketing tactic and everyone wants to get on the eco-friendly bandwagon, few establishments actually stay true to their word and quite literally get their hands dirty in trying to save our planet.
For a tropical island like Sri Lanka, heavily dependent on industries such as tourism to keep us afloat, taking care of the very environment we depend on is of utmost importance.
Eco-friendly hotels and resorts across the island constantly strive to come up with new and innovative ways to conserve energy and reduce their carbon footprint. In the last five years of operation, Cocoon Resort & Villas in Induruwa has followed suit with several ongoing projects and more in the pipeline.
Cocoon currently boasts 168 solar panels which generate 50KVA to the national grid per day. The resort also takes it a step further with only using energy efficient lighting and promoting simple energy-conscious deeds like switching off lights and air conditioning in unused areas.
Not limiting to energy conservation, Cocoon also has its very own waste water management and rain water harvesting project that saves up to 400,000L of water. It is then used via an underground sprinkler system to keep the resorts lush lawns green and healthy even during the dry season. The reverse osmosis system installed at the property also purifies the drinking water used at the resort making it safe for all guests.
Recently Cocoon Resort also partnered with 'Think Green', a company specialized in recycling electronic waste to ensure the safe and clean disposal of electronic waste from the resort.
Speaking on these projects the General Manager of Cocoon Resort & Villas said, Tourism is what sustains this nation and in turn we as those who are involved in the industry need to do everything possible to sustain the nature we operate in. There is no point in converting our beautiful island home into a concrete jungle when thats not what people come here for. So it is imperative for hotels and resorts specifically to make sure that the environment we place ourselves in is preserved in the best possible way. This is what we strive for at Cocoon and want others in the industry and even our guests to follow suit.
The management at Cocoon Resort & Villas also has plans to convert a section of the garden into an organic plantation, where vegetables and fruits will be grown and the harvest used to prepare the meals served at the resort. This will also open up more job opportunities to farmer communities in the Southern Coast.
Furthermore, the resort is blessed with an abundance of bird life and an in-house naturalist is also being brought in to introduce nesting and breeding of endemic birds. Ensuring that the balance of nature is not disrupted, this will also provide a great opportunity for nature enthusiastic travellers to witness flora and fauna in its natural habitat.
The gardens at Cocoon are also home to two varieties of endemic monkeys making it a budding nature reserve.

Combank enhances corporate website with  assistive technology for differently-abled persons
The Commercial Bank of Ceylon has broken new ground in enhancing access for differently-abled persons by enriching its corporate website with special assistive technologies for users with visual disabilities, hearing impairments, physical disabilities and age-related conditions.
Designed to comply with Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 developed by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), Commercial Banks recently revamped corporate website makes it easier for users with visual, auditory and physical difficulties to access information on the Bank.
The website is optimised for speech recognition and screen reading for users with visual as well as physical disabilities, provides supplemental highlighting of content and visual notification for users with hearing impairments and improves accessibility for those with other disabilities.
As the largest private bank in the country, we are committed to enhancing access to information and services to the widest possible spectrum of consumers, Commercial Bank Managing Director/CEO Jegan Durairatnam said.
We have ensured that a significant portion of our branches and ATMs have convenient access for differently-abled customers and we are now looking at web access, and the difficulties posed for people with physical and visual difficulties.
The website has Voice-over on the latest version of iOS and OS X, TalkBack on the latest versions of Android and the latest version of NVDA on Windows. The content has been optimised to be compatible with the latest and the most popular assistive tools for differently-abled users.
The website can be accessed through desktop and laptop computers and mobile devices with Android, iOS, Windows (8, 7, Vista and XP) and MacOS X operating systems.
Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.0 defines how to make web content more accessible to people with disabilities. It is based on the four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust.
The only Sri Lankan bank to be ranked among the Top 1000 banks of the world for seven years consecutively, Commercial Bank operates a network of 256 branches and 695 ATMs in Sri Lanka.
The Bank won 10 major international awards in 2016 and has over the years won multiple awards as Sri Lankas Best Bank, Best Trade Bank, Strongest Bank and Most Respected Bank from a number of local and international institutions and publications. It has also been adjudged one of Sri Lankas 10 best corporate citizens by the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce for several years.
Commercial Banks overseas operations encompass Bangladesh, where the Bank operates 19 outlets, Myanmar, where it has a Representative Office in Yangon, the Maldives, where the Bank opened a fully-fledged Tier I Bank with a stake of 55% in September 2016 and Italy, where the Bank launched its own money transfer service in November 2016.

Continued Improvements in Health Indicators
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) takes steps to identify, collect, analyse and communicate the information needed for the development programmes of the country. For this purpose, the DCS and the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine collaborates to update and expand the database on a number of crucial aspects of health. The purpose is to provide information for evidence-informed decision making in enhancing the effectiveness of health service delivery. Health service delivery is guided by the health needs of the population. It involves assessing the health status of the people, analysing the causes, and incorporating the knowledge gained in refining programmes and policies. Current information is also essential for monitoring progress, proactively taking corrective action including strategic, legislative and policy enhancements, and advocating for desired levels of funding. To promote the essential process of evidence-informed decision making and action, the DCS in collaboration with the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine conducted the Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) 2016.
Increasing emphasis by planners and policy makers on the utilization of objective indicators for policy formulation, planning, and measuring progress has increased the reliance on regular household survey data, given the inadequate availability of appropriate information from administrative statistics and other routine data-collection systems. Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) are conducted in many countries to provide quality data related to the health sector for policy development and programme planning, monitoring and evaluation. The DHS collects a wealth of health related information on a wide range of topics, which are important for informed decision making in the health sector of the country.
DHS evolved from the World Fertility Surveys and the Contraceptive Prevalence Surveys implemented in the 1970s and 1980s. Like their predecessors, the DHS originally collected comparable population-based data on fertility, contraception, maternal and child health, and nutrition in developing countries. Today, the DHS core questionnaires are based on the best of scientific and technical knowledge and decades of survey experience. They are standardised and well-tested internationally and adapted for country contexts. In addition to the core topics, countries choose to collect data on special health issues including human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), malaria and domestic violence using optional modules.
The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) conducted the fifth Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey (SLDHS) in 2016, which is the first ever DHS conducted countrywide, at the request of the Ministry of Health and Indigenous Medicine. The SLDHS 2016 is a follow-up to the 1987, 1993, 2000 and 2006/07 Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Surveys. This survey was funded by the World Bank under the Second Health Sector Development Project (SHSDP)  Component II. Data collection took place from May to November 2016. ICF provided technical assistance.
Survey objectives
The SLDHS 2016 was undertaken to address the needs of the health sector programmes. The survey was designed to provide policy makers in the Ministry of Health and other organizations with information for effectively planning, monitoring, and evaluating future interventions both at the national and regional levels, especially health sector activities. Specifically, the 2016 SLDHS collected information on maternal and child health, reproduction and fertility preferences, family planning, evaluation of maternal and child health services, womens status, and knowledge and behaviour regarding HIV/AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases etc.
Sample design
A nationally representative sample of 26,178 housing units was selected for the survey and 27,210 households in these housing units were enumerated to provide district level estimates. Within the households interviewed, a total of 18,540 eligible women were identified, of whom 18,302 were successfully interviewed. Detailed information was collected from all ever-married women aged 15-49 years about themselves and their children born after January 2011. All women aged 15-49 in selected households were eligible for individual interviews.
ICT tools for enumerations
For the first time, the Computer Assisted Personal Interview (CAPI) technique was used to collect data in this survey by the DCS. CAPI refers to interviews conducted using hand-held devices such as tablets or ultra-mobile personal computers. The questionnaire is configured using CAPI software and is loaded on to the device.
The enumerator reads the questions to the respondent, and inputs the responses directly into the device. This electronic data capture approach eliminates the need for post-interview data entry and thus allows for immediate data retrieval leading to improved quality and timeliness of statistics. Previously, with pen-and-paper interviewing (PAPI), the responses had to be transferred to digital format through manual data entry after the interview. DCS now uses this technology for its surveys.
Key findings
Data collected through the DHS deepens and transforms the understanding of population, health and nutrition issues in the country. As far as possible, the DHS uses consistent survey methods and questionnaires to measure key indicators, including infant and child mortality, fertility, family planning use, maternal health, child immunization, malnutrition levels, HIV prevalence and more. Therefore, data from these surveys are comparable across time and regions. Some of the key findings of the SLDHS  2016 are given below.
Access to amenities
Ninety percent of the households have access to an improved source of drinking water with the majority of them having a water source on premises (80 percent, an increase from 72 percent in the 2006 SLDHS). Equally, importantly, 90 percent of the households and population have access to improved sanitary facilities. As per household amenities/possessions, it was revealed that almost all households (97 percent) have access to electricity (increased from 80 percent in 2006). Two thirds, or 66 percent use wood and solid fuel for cooking (down from 79percent in 2006) and TV and mobile phones access has substantially increased to 87percent and 91percent respectively (from 77 percent and 39percent respectively in 2006).
Education
The 2016 SLDHS confirmed high levels of participation in education across the country with a median of 9.4 years (9.4 years for females and 9.2 years for males) of education. Primary school attendance is almost universal, while net school attendance in secondary education is as high as 83 percent.
Ever-married Women (E-MW)
The distribution of E-MW by place of residence, ethnicity and religion confirmed previous distributions: 81 percent rural residence, 76 percent Sinhalese, and 71 percent Buddhist. Ninety percent of E-MW were currently married, 4 percent were living together and 6 percent were widowed, divorced or separated. Only 18 percent of E-MW had ever used internet and 16.4 percent used it during the last 12 months. One out of three E-MW reported as employed during the week before the survey. Age at first sexual intercourse of E-MW was 23.5 years, but 12 percent of them reported at age of 18 years. The median age at first marriage of E-MW was 23.7 years, but 12 percent of them had married exactly at the age of 18 years.
Fertility
Fertility has continued to decline to values approaching replacement levels including in all sectors. The 2016 SLDHS reports a TFR of 2.2 children per woman of reproductive age. Substantial changes were observed among adolescents and young people (15-19 and 20-24). The TFR levels, trends and observed changes are well supported by the observed values under the basic determinants of fertility, such as marriage and contraception. The median age at first birth has also increased substantially to 25.6 years. In addition, only 3 percent of teenagers reported a live birth or to be pregnant at the time of the survey.
Sri Lanka has consistently made commendable advances towards child survival. This has resulted in the decline of infant mortality, child mortality and Under 5 mortality rates from 25 to 10, from 9 to 1 and 35 to 11 respectively during the period 1987 to 2016
Contraception
Contraception and contraceptive methods are universally known in Sri Lanka. Seventy two percent of the currently married women had a demand for contraception in 2016. Of these, close to two out of three (65 percent) currently married women were using contraception. The remaining 7 percent have an unmet need for contraception. Of the total demand for contraception, close to 90 percent of the demand for contraception is satisfied, mainly by modern contraception.
Increase in the level of contraceptive use was observed among adolescents and young adults 20-24, particularly in the use of IUDs and Implants. Although 35 percent of the currently married women were not using contraception, only 8 percent had an unmet need for contraception.
The public-sector act as the main provider of contraception (97 percent for IUD, 99 percent for implants, 94 percent of sterilizations and 57 percent for pills). The private sectors participation is strong for the provision of injectable (68 percent), male condoms (61 percent) and pills (43 percent).
As for informed choice, there are still challenges. For example, only 53 percent of current users were informed about side effects. Further, only 50 percent were told what to do in case of experiencing side effects and only 42 percent were informed about other available methods.
Child mortality
Under-five mortality or deaths of children under five years of age computed from the SLDHS 2016 was 11 per 1,000 live births (from 21 in 2006). Infant and child mortality has continued to decline during the last ten years.
Reproductive Health
Ninety nine percent of the pregnancies in the country received antenatal care: assistance from health facilities (95 percent visiting health facilities during the first month of pregnancy, 96 percent attended by health personnel and, 80 percent protected against neonatal tetanus).
Almost all births had taken place in a health facility (94 percent in public and 5 percent in private). As for postnatal care, 99 percent of the births received assistance within two days of birth.
Unfortunately, 16 percent of the births were low birth weight (less than 2,500 grams at birth). In eight districts, this percentage was 18 percent or greater.In terms of illness affecting children under the age of five 2.4 percent were affected by acute respiratory infections (ARI); 14.3 percent by fever, and 2.7 percent by diarrhoea (all below the levels observed in 2006). Almost all mothers (97 percent) knew about ORS; 91 percent of the mothers were aware about the proper ways of stool disposal.
Nutrition status of children and women
The prevalence of stunting (height for age) among children under five years of age was 17 percent while prevalence of underweight (weight for age) and wasting (height for weight) were 21 percent and 15 percent respectively.
Among ever-married women, 9 percent were found to be thin, 32 percent overweight, and 13 percent obese.
The majority (90 percent) of children were breastfed almost immediately after birth (98 percent within one day). Almost all households (95 percent) had supplies of iodized salt at home.
HIV/AIDS
Almost all ever-married women (93 percent) had heard about HIV/AIDS but only one out of three (33 percent) had comprehensive knowledge of AIDS (prevention and misconceptions). Yet alarmingly, this value was only 24 percent among young adults aged 15-24 years. Ten percent of the ever-married women had been tested for AIDS but only 74 percent of them received the results from the test.
Status of Women
The majority of ever-married women (83 percent) had access to a bank account and 78 percent used a mobile phone. Only 35 percent were making decisions related to their health care, 20 percent on purchasing household amenities and/or 16 percent on when to visit friends or family.
Health indicators of SDGs
The 2030 Agenda for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) is the worlds first comprehensive blueprint for sustainable development.
Launched at the end of 2015, this agenda frames health and well-being as both outcomes and foundations of social inclusion, poverty reduction and environmental protection. From a health perspective, development can be said to be sustainable when resources  natural and manufactured  are managed by and for all individuals in ways which support the health and well-being of present and future generations.
Associated with each Sustainable Development Goal is a series of targets and each target is measured by one or more indicators. Many of the targets in the areas of good health, zero hunger, no poverty, quality education, gender equality, clean water and sanitation, and reduced inequalities can be measured at least indirectly from DHS surveys. SLDHS 2016 compiled data for SDG indicators:
Prevalence of stunting; prevalence of underweight and wasting; proportion of births attended by skilled health personnel; proportion of women of reproductive age (aged 15-49 years) who have their need for family planning satisfied with modern methods; proportion of ever-partnered women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to physical, sexual or psychological violence by a current or former intimate partner in the previous 12 months disaggregated by type of violence and by age; proportion of women and girls aged 15 years and older subjected to sexual violence by persons other than an intimate partner in the previous 12 months, proportion of women aged 20-24 years who were married or in a union before age 15 and before age 18 etc.
These indicators compiled from SLDHS 2016 can be used as baseline data for assessing progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals.
Conclusion
The report Sri Lanka Demographic and Health Survey  2016 containing key findings of the survey: SLDHS - 2016, was launched on September 18 and the first copy of the report was presented to the Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister at a ceremony held at the Bandaranayake Memorial International Hall, Colombo. A soft copy of the report is published in the website of the DCS: www.statistics.gov.lk.
Health is regarded by the World Health Organization as a fundamental human right, and health promotion is defined as the process of enabling people to increase control over their health and its determinants, and there by improve their health.
The findings of the survey may be used for Health promotion in concert with other strategies including education, community development, policy, legislation and regulation for preventing communicable and non-communicable diseases and/or even for realigning current health policies to match with current and future needs.
The above report contains only a few of the key indicators derived from SLDHS 2016. To build the policy and programmatic evidence base, DHS data must be further analysed by researchers following standard protocols and rigorous methods.
As seen in the data presented above, Sri Lanka has made very impressive progress in many of the measured areas. Progress may be inadequate in others.
The multiple reasons for slow progress in hard to change areas must be understood through scientific analysis.
Evidence from research for decisions and actions must be made accessible in user-friendly packages for assimilation and utilization by policy makers and programme managers. Current policies and programmes can then be realigned as necessary for addressing the obstacles while maintaining the great achievements made so far.

CONTROVERSIAL PRISONS DOCTOR TRANSFERRED: Professional misconduct the main reason
The Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital, Dr.Nirmali Thenuwara was ordered to be transferred to the Colombo National Hospital by Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne yesterday.
The decision had been taken by the minister following concerns raised by 19 doctors attached to the Prison Hospital about the conduct of Dr.Thenuwara.
The 19 doctors attached to the Prison Hospital had arrived at the Health Ministry obtaining medical leave and handed over a 26 point report to Minister Senaratne which outlines the details of professional misconduct by the current Acting Chief Medical Officer. Following the discussion with the doctors, the Health Minister had instructed the Acting Director General of Health Services Dr.Jayasundara Bandara to transfer the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital to the National Hospital, Health Ministry Media Director Prasanna Adhikari said in a statement.
The team of doctors asked for a CID investigation on the issue and Minister Senaratne will forward a letter to the IGP with the signature of the Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara requesting a CID investigation, he said.
J. K. Malwatta will be appointed as the Acting Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital soon. Minister Senaratne ordered to fill the vacancy of the Chief Medical Officer of the Welikada Prison Hospital next year.
It is vacant now. The Minister ordered high rank health officials to provide the report on the investigation conducted on doctors attached to the hospital, he added. Recently several politicians accused Dr.Thenuwara of giving special treatment to VIP inmates transferred to the Prison Hospital Meanwhile,UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake recently requested the Director General of Health to transfer Dr.Thenuwara for allegedly giving special treatment to Lalith Weeratunga, former Secretary to President Mahinda Rajapaksa, and former Director General of Telecommunication Regulatory Commission (TRC) Anusha Palpita, convicted in the Sil redi case.

Court recalls arrest warrant against Weerakumara Dissanayake
Colombo Chief Magistrates Court recalled the arrest warrant issued against the National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake after he appeared before Court, yesterday.
Earlier in the day, the Colombo Chief Magistrate issued a warrant for the arrest of National Freedom Front (NFF) Parliamentarian Weerakumara Dissanayake for his failure to appear in Court over a case filed by Cinnamon Garden Police. Cinnamon Garden Police are expecting to file charge sheets against National Freedom Front (NFF) leader and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa and six other party activists for allegedly providing leadership to a protest which blocked the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.
However, when the case came up before Chief Magistrate Lal Ranasinghe Bandara, the suspect Weerakumara Dissanayake was not present in Court.
On February 6, 2016, the NFF staged a protest march against the visit of United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra'ad Al Hussein.
Seven suspects - NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne, Mohammed Muzammil and Don Lusian - are currently out on bail.
The Police had informed Court that the suspects who organized the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from the police to organise the march.
They further alleged that the organizers had also used loudspeakers without a valid license.
The Police further submitted to Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic.

Elections in the near future: Govt never feared elections:Amaraweera
A series of elections will be held in the near future to enable people to exercise their votes at will. The government never feared to face elections despite contrary claims made by its opponents and detractors, said Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera.
Amaraweera said what the government actually desired was to prevent the rivalry to gain preferential votes among candidates.
The government anxiously waited until such a system of elections was formulated in order to call for elections. Local government elections and several other elections will be held in the near future. Now people will get an opportunity to elect a representative for their own area, he said.
The minister was addressing a meeting at the Kalutara Assistant Fisheries Directors' office to mark the distribution of E-log books to owners of 55 multi-day boats, and housing and sanitation assistance to fisher families in the area on September 16.
Minister Amaraweera said the credit should go to President Maithripala Sirisena for ending the fight for preferential votes.
The Minister said although people expressed various views about the Sil cloth case, the two public officials were found fault with not for distributing Sil' cloths but for timing the distribution on the eve of an election to benefit a particular candidate.
Western Provincial Councils Education Minister Ranjith Somawansa was also present on the occasion.

Emirates customers will also be able to enjoy seamless A380 to A380 connections to 48 destinations within Emirates global network via its hub in Dubai.
Earlier this year Emirates announced plans to enhance its Australian services, with a third daily service set to be introduced between Dubai and Brisbane from December 1, 2017 and operated by a B777-200LR. Emirates will also upgauge its third daily flight between Dubai and Melbourne from a B777-300ER to an A380 from March 25, 2018. This change will ensure all three of Emirates daily flights to Melbourne will be serviced by A380 aircraft.
All passengers can enjoy over 2,500 channels on Emirates award-winning inflight entertainment system ice, gourmet food and wine across all classes and generous baggage allowances. Emirates recently improved its onboard connectivity with up to 20MB of complementary onboard Wi-Fi.
Between March 25 and March 30, 2018, the inbound service EK416 will depart Dubai at 20:40, arriving in Sydney at 17:20 the following day. Due to daylight savings from 31 March 2018, the arrival time changes to 16:30 the following day.
Between March 26 to March 31, 2018, the outbound service EK417 will depart Sydney at 17:05, arriving in Dubai at 00:25 the following day. Due to daylight savings from April 1, the outbound service EK417 will depart Sydney 16:15, arriving the same time the following day. All services will be operated by an A380 aircraft.
The A380 aircraft offers 489 seats in a three-class cabin configuration with 14 private suites in First Class, 76 flat-bed seats in Business Class and 399 spacious seats in Economy.
Emirates currently operates 77 weekly flights from Dubai to Australia, with flights to Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Perth and Adelaide. The third daily service to Brisbane and fourth daily service to Sydney will bring this to 91 weekly flights.

Five-match ODI  series starts today: Windies brace for strong  England test
There is little doubt that Twenty20 cricket is Windies domain, and it showed that with a clinical display against England on Saturday. But with five One-Day Internationals lined up, the first of which begins on Tuesday (today) at Old Trafford, theres equally little doubt which side enjoys the format more.
England has won six of its last seven ODI series, including a 3-0 drubbing of Windies in the Caribbean in March. Windies, meanwhile, hasnt won a series since 2014.
Thats why it is languishing at No. 9 in the International Cricket Council ODI rankings, didnt make the cut for the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in England and Wales, and could miss on direct qualification for the ICC Cricket World Cup 2019, also in the United Kingdom. Only the top seven teams, and the host, as per the cut-off date on September 30 are guaranteed entry. Unless the West Indies beat England 5-0  or wins 4-0 with a no-result/tie  the two-time World Cup winner will need to take part in a qualifying event next year to participate in the marquee event.
Cricket West Indies decision to bury the hatchet with its star players might have come a few series too late for it to have an effect on the rankings but for the long-suffering fans of the team, its better late than never.
Chris Gayle, set to play his first 50-over game since the ICC Cricket World Cup 2015 quarter-final, showed a glimpse of what he can do on Saturday. Much will depend on how he and Evin Lewis translate their T20I form into ODIs. Shai Hope -- the highest run-getter in the Test series in England across both sides -- will also be a key cog.
Similarly, the bowling too has received a boost with Jerome Taylor returning to the side. Jason Holder, the captain, will need to lead the way once again, and ensure that Alzarri Joseph, the 20-year-old quick who has been cooling his heels since a wicketless outing in the Edgbaston Test, hits the reset button.
England, though, will be prepared. The fans were denied a proper ICC World T20 2016 final rematch with the selectors resting Ben Stokes for the T20I, but the talismanic all-rounder is back for the ODIs. Theres already been a bit of needle between him and Windies in the red-ball game, but with Marlon Samuels also back in the ODI set-up, more fireworks -- be it batting, bowling, or otherwise -- can be expected.
Jason Roy working himself back into form with Surrey could see him displace Johnny Bairstow in the playing XI. That England can afford to do so speaks volumes of its batting depth, with Alex Hales, Joe Root, Eoin Morgan, Jos Buttler and Moeen Ali providing more than sufficient firepower.
Its bowling is also likely to have more bite in the ODIs. It was Liam Plunkett who ensured Windies didnt post a score in excess of 200 after a strong start in the T20I, and its worth remembering that he is Englands highest wicket-taker in ODIs this year. Meanwhile, the bowler thats third on that list, Chris Woakes, will be watched keenly.
He looked rusty in the Headingley Test and England all but admitted it was a mistake to rush him back into the side after a long injury layoff. But with the Ashes looming, regaining rhythm will be crucial.
All in all, the Windies will be hard-pressed to pull the rug from underneath Englands feet.  ICC News

Healthcare doublespeak
Turning and turning in the widening gyreThe falcon cannot bear the falconer;Things fall apart; the centre cannot hold;Mere anarchy is loosed upon the world. (W B Yeats The Second Coming)
Get thee glass eyes and like a scurvy politician, seem to see the things thou does not (Shakespeare, King Lear, Act IV, Scene 5)For the good of the many (bahujana hitaya)  The Buddha
Every country has faced the need for market forces and liberalization in public health. For the achievement of health objectives, there can be state non-market oriented, market-oriented or integrated healthcare systems. The pressing issue in Sri Lanka has been the inadequacy of health human resources, in particular, the doctors. There has been a perspective plan for health manpower development, in the late 90s which indicated the requirement of doctors on an annual basis. The governments through have been trying to respond to health manpower needs. State medical colleges have been increased at a slow pace. But needs ever increased with time. The 30-year civil war heavily and adversely influenced the implementation of the health manpower development plan. If not, the government could have increased the number of admissions of the eligible students, expanded the existing training institutions, rented out accommodation and invested on new infrastructure.
The attempt of planning, and producing doctors in private medical colleges has been a much-concerned issue. The best example was the Colombo North Medical College (NCMC). The schemata and the scripts connected with the NCMC cannot be blot out of memory. These schemata and scripts foreshadowed the sequence of similar mishaps in the future as a private medical college could pave access only to the minority of financially affordable privileged segment of students.
The same issue erupted after the establishment of a private medical college at Malabe. This medical college was established with constitutional and legislative cover. There have been no protests when it was established or when it had been functioning for a decade until the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) began a series of protests and organised hospital strikes. The patients were taken to risk adventures. Malabe Medical College has been given a rude metonym. The GMOA was dissatisfied with the culture, climate, policies, and procedures in private medical education. Their demands revolved around two issues. They were against the establishment of private medical colleges. This was the main issue. Their stand was that medical education should not be a commercial commodity and free education should continue to flourish. They also pointed out that the quality of medical education in private medical colleges would be below the accepted international standards. Some members of the public, university students, Trade Unions and some politicians too were actively supporting the GMOA demand. The government was under intense pressure from this powerful professional group.
Malabe Medical College
It could have been fortunate to have changed the pressure to an advantage for an unplanned policy change. The government might have thanked the GMOA for offering an opportunity to change a wrong short-sighted decision taken by the previous governing regime. The second issue pertaining to poor quality did not carry sufficient weight in the perspective of total quality management as the management of Malabe Medical College (MMC) has been taking positive steps to launch full-scale quality programmes. Further Dr Neville Fernando, the owner of MMC has been a medical doctor who has been conscious of quality criteria. But, there has been no opportunity for quality monitoring and evaluation of the products. However, the GMOA was resolutely firm that the quality of the products would be far below the products produced by the state medical colleges and employing the medical graduates from this private medical college would be a risk to the patients. The GMOA too has been aware of the unqualified quack doctors practicing in the country. It has been criticized that integrity is associated with professional jealousy. Total quality management was part of a holistic approach to quality progress which was already available in the state medical institutions.
The GMOA was the powerful backbone to the state health services. The large numbers of doctors were coercive leaders, innovators, and powerful change agents. They have exploited their power for influencing planning and managing changes with success. The doctors as change agents took an expert role as well as a facilitating role. As internal change agents, doctors became catalysts. They were pioneers in the field of medical education.
The government was placed in a state of a dilemma when the GMOA demanded the closure of the Malabe Medical College (MMC). There were three topics that one would wish to broach significant in comprehending the issue of Malabe Medical College (MMC). Firstly, the government was aware of the nationalization schemes that failed in the past. Secondly, there were private schools, private international schools, private institutions and even institutions affiliated to foreign universities. All these were fee levying institutions. Many countries have private medical colleges. These colleges were available even in developing countries. Further, after the breakdown in the Soviet bloc, the former socialist countries too have established private medical colleges. Many Sri Lankan students sought admission to these institutions and these were recognized by the Sri Lanka Medical Council. Private institutions did not run at a loss. There were the profit motive and the surplus income motive in operation in addition to service provision. Thirdly, in a democratic milieu, the existence and operation of fee levied teaching institutions were not restricted.
The establishment of the MMC became a solace that vastly curtailed the high cost of medical training in foreign medical colleges and saved foreign expenditure. But the GMIA was of the opinion that a private medical college should be disallowed to function because it was marketing medical education, catering the minor segment of the financially affordable population. No politician knew better than a medical professional about the quality of medical education because the doctors were voicing their opinion through first-hand practical experience, the GMOA perspective has been resourcefully and programmatically sound.
Essential services and goods free from direct cost to the population in need, are a panacea. The population would be too pleased to enjoy free services and free goods. In Sri Lanka, education and healthcare are free services. Prevision of water to the farming communities has been a long-term welfare measure. Every government has been efficiently managing environmental disasters. Some time ago we enjoyed two measures of free rice and free school mid-day meals. Free housing schemes and free distribution of lands are in operation. Free manure and a pension scheme for the farmers are available. The Poverty Alleviation (Samurdhi) Programme is open to raising the living standards of the poor. All these schemes and projects are aimed to serve the deserving and eligible majority of the population. But yet sugar and salt do not come under the list of free goods. The list of free services and goods could be expanded. In some countries, there are some other services and goods that are free to their population. Some countries offer a financial incentive to the unemployed. Sri Lanka is moving towards a welfare state and Sri Lanka is a country with widespread democracy. There have been protests, trade union actions, and even riots over human, economic, political and social issues since 1947. The outstanding feature of all these protests has been their success. For instance, soon after the 1947 mass protest, the salaries of the minor employees were increased, they were issued free railway certificates and a pension scheme was devised.
GMOA demands
Democratic governments are transient. Some politicians blamed the government for becoming autocratic. Further, the elections were around the corner. Suppose another party came into power, say those who were supporting the GMOA, they would have to implement the GMOA demand. The government has diagnosed its far-reaching relevance and impact. It would be a step for weakening capitalism (private ownership) into public property. The Government has committed itself to a dedicated, honest and genuine free market economy subject to the preservation of a welfare state.
What was essential was quick and appropriate management for a patient injured by an arrow and not waste time in finding out the answers to the five questions connected with the injury. Why the GMOA did not protest at the inception of Malabe Medical College has been argued. However, the government could be happy when there was a powerful professional organisation levering, nurturing and rewarding a wholesome workable policy planning response.
Malabe Medical College (MMC) was established with full recognition and with good intentions and the management has been improving the quality of medical training. It could be looked upon as a feasibility project and having germinated, flowered and came to fruition. The blessings of democracy have been with it for a decade but an unexpected shift has taken place. The medical graduates of MMC need not be crestfallen as medical training goes beyond frontiers and local boundaries. Human genetic potential finds its expression best in a democratic environment. There are avenues for making effective use of their knowledge.
As long as Malabe Medical College remains a state recognized medical degree awarding institution by the Government, international institutions like the World Health Organisation and other countries, it can continue to perform its assured functions and there would be clients opting for its valued services. Even foreign students would seek admission. Making it a non-fee levying state-recognized institution or affiliating it to another state university would be justifiable in the context of the GMOA. Such a policy change would favour availability, accessibility, coverage, equity, efficiency, effectiveness, quality and impact of medical education without extra cost to the eligible students. However, the ownership should be suitably compensated while ethical, legal and human rights issues require careful attention as Dr Neville Fernando has invested on it with good intentions and under the constitutional agreement.
There are those who know and those who don't want to know. If the latter remain in the majority, and we prove so unimaginative, cowardly and self-interested that we fail to tend the early growth of this small seedling, we will soon ourselves wither and die with it. (Kinsman 1990).
A democratic government is determined to uphold, safeguard and develop free public education at all levels including university education to ensure that national education would not be left to the mercy of market forces and the privileged class. In particular, only a very small percentage of the students with secondary education are admitted to the universities.
Danger of selfishness andprivate ownership
The principal characteristic of a democratic, socialist society should be the absence of private ownership of property. The Buddha did not find fault with such capitalists as guild leader Anatha Pindika or Maha Dhana. He did not suggest that their wealth should be distributed among the poor. But, he indicated how best the wealth should be utilized and pointed out the danger of selfishness and private ownership. The Buddha advised that one should treat everybody alike, like the moon, (Sarda 1998). In the MMC 30% of the students study on a scholarship basis the financial value being Rs 550 million declared Dr Neville Fernando (Mavbima, 23.7.1917 p 25). Undoubtedly the percentage could be increased.
Negotiations have been going on. Both sides have refused to give in. The GMOA made their request loud and clear. The MMC was a two-sided systemic conflict which became a win-win situation linked to a power struggle. The GMOA had a fixed objective; no other acceptable alternative and refused flexibility from the other side. Making a decision became a power struggle.
The GMOA gave deadlines and the government made concessions. Both parties were concerned with Democracy but did not split the difference and lay planks through the quicksand. One option was to allow MMC to continue while the government made positive steps to absorb the increasing number of eligible students to the state medical institutions. Another option was to carry on as usual and win a no-confidence motion and the coming elections. Yet another option was to conduct a stratified sample study of the general population for a consensus or present a proposal in parliament for free voting on the MMC issue and other burning issues.

Two such devices to be imported from the Massachusetts Eue and Ear Infirmary in Boston, USA are estimated to cost Rs. 330,000.
Ranjani says she has to attend the Cornea Clinic of the National Eye Hospital regularly and all this involved an unbearable expenditure.
She requests philanthropists and the public to assist her cause by sending whatever financial contributions possible to help raise the money and enable her to regain her vision.

Hotel Asia 2017 kicks off in the Maldives
Over 175 exhibitors are showcasing their products and portfolios covering aspects of the industry and modern security systems and a wide array of hotel supplies, Chief Judge Alan Palmer said at the opening of Hotel Asia 2017 in the Maldives.
Maldivian Minister of Finance and Treasury Ahmed Munawar said that the event also helps the growth of the country's tourism sector.
He said that today 35% of GDP is generated from the tourism sector in the Maldives and tourism is the key driver of the archipelago's economy.
He said that they have recorded over 700,000 arrivals with over 35% from China and are hopeful to pass the 1.3 million mark by the end of the year. "We also hope for more arrivals from Europe in the future," he said.
Hotels in Male have been sold out for this period due to the increasing number of visitors and exhibitors for the event and this too shows the potential of the industry. The event is also a meeting place for buyers and sellers to meet and is a very important show for the country's tourism sector development, he said.
The overriding purpose of the show is to cultivate healthy relationships between hospitality providers, suppliers and the community, explained Aasim Mukthar, CEO of MECS, the organizers of the event. The only way to achieve any growth potential is through harmonious relationships in trade and services. Hotel Asia is a platform for counterparts to speak to each other. It is a one stop shop for anyone in the hospitality field.
The three-day event will introduce a series of seminars and masterclasses in conjunction with the exhibition and culinary challenge.
Hotel Asia is organized by Maldives Exhibition and Conference Services. The event is endorsed and supported by the Ministry of Tourism and Ministry of Economic Development together with the support of the Maldives Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Liveaboard Association of Maldives. Bestbuy Maldives (BBM) continues its support as the main sponsor of the event since its inception.
The Hotel Asia International Culinary Challenge is the region's premier culinary competition which also obtained due recognition and endorsement from the World Association of Chefs Societies (Worldchefs - WACS).
The exhibition itself is a tremendous opportunity for resort owners to see new technology, products and services that are available in the market.

Hurricane Maria batters Dominica as category five storm

Hurricane Maria, strengthened to a "potentially catastrophic" category five storm, has torn into the Caribbean island of Dominica with sustained winds of 260km/h (160mph). 
Prime Minister Roosevelt Skerrit posted on Facebook that his roof had been torn off and he was "at the complete mercy of the hurricane". He said his house had flooded, later adding that he had been rescued. 
Dominica's airport and ports have been closed. 
Maria is moving roughly along the same track as Irma, the hurricane that devastated the region this month. The nearby island of Martinique has declared a maximum-level alert while another French island, Guadeloupe, ordered evacuations. 
Hurricane warnings are also in place for: 
Puerto Rico: The US territory expects Maria to make landfall as a category three on Tuesday. It escaped the worst of Irma and has been an important hub for getting relief to islands more badly affected. 
Governor Ricardo Rossello urged islanders to seek refuge US Virgin Islands and British Virgin Islands: Both island chains suffered severe damage from Irma and President Donald Trump declared a state of emergency for the US territories on Monday. British authorities fear debris left behind by Irma could be whipped up by the new storm and pose an extra threat. 
Warnings are also in effect for St Kitts and Nevis, Montserrat and St Lucia while hurricane watches are in place for St Martin, Saba, St Eustatius and Anguilla. 
Some of these islands are still recovering after being hit by Hurricane Irma - another category five hurricane which left at least 37 people dead and caused billions of dollars' worth of damage. 
Latest updates on Hurricane MariaUK territories prepare for worst The islands bearing the brunt of Maria are part of the Leeward Islands chain and include Antigua and Barbuda. The latter was evacuated after being devastated by Irma. 
The US National Hurricane Center (NHC) increased the strength of Maria in just a few hours on Monday from a category two storm, to a category four and then to category five - the highest level. 
Forecasters warned that heavy rainfall caused by the hurricane "could cause life-threatening flash floods and mudslides". Dominica is a former British colony with a population of 72,000 about half way between Guadeloupe and Martinique. 
The eye of the hurricane made landfall there at 21:00 local time (01:00 GMT Tuesday), the NHC reported. All ports and airports are closed and residents near the coast have been ordered to go to authorised shelters.
Curtis Matthew, a journalist based in the capital, Roseau, told the BBC that conditions went "very bad, rapidly". 
"We are not able to even see properly what is happening on the road. The winds are very, very strong, we can hear the noise on the outside. We still don't know what the impact is going to be when this is all over. But what I can say it does not look good for Dominica as we speak," he said. 
Martinique raised its alert status to "violet", the highest level, and ordered its population to seek shelter. In Guadeloupe , schools, businesses and government buildings have all been closed and severe flooding is predicted. 
The French government has ordered low-lying areas on the islands to be evacuated, AFP reports.Image captionThe Leeward Islands - where Maria will first strike - includes Antigua and Barbuda The British government said more than 1,300 troops were staying put in the region and an addit

The World International Ozone Day will be celebrated in the Kudawa Grama Niladhari Divison, Kandakuliya, Kalpitiya from 9.30 am on September 18 under the patronage of Mahaweli Development and Environment Deputy Minister Anuradha Jayaratne.
The National Ozone Unit will launch a programme marking the day to cultivate 2,000 mangrove plants with the participation of schoolchildren.
Researchers have proved that mangroves absorb the UV-B in the UV rays that is harmful to living beings. Mangroves store more carbon, 10 to 50 times, more than tropical forests do. They release carbonic materials to the sea thereby providing food for worms and small fish varieties. Furthermore, the mangroves act as a natural filter between the land and sea and block the silt, metal slag and various other chemical waste reaching the sea.

Several officials led by Buddhist activities Commissioner and Monaragala District Secretary D. A. Pathmakulasuriya, Kataragama Divisional Secretary S. C. Weerakone, Basnayake Nilame D. P. Kumarage, five kapuralas with Chief Kapurala Somipala Ratnayake, Tangalle Division ASP K. G. L. Geethal and Kataragama Police OIC Chief Inspector Upali Kariyawasam also participated.
The discussion was held for nearly three hours. After the discussion, Minister Jayawickrama said that Kataragama was a place where the Buddah had visited and there, invaluable things had been treasured by King Dutugamunu in the past. He said that therefore, they had to keep the respect of the place. He added, in the past also there were difference of opinions between kapuralas and Basnayake nilames, but this problem had aggravated due to the intervention of outside people.
Jayawickrama said that there were five senior kapuralas to conduct the rituals of of each month of the year. So it was decided to give five excess months for five kapuralas whose fathers were dead, from those recently appointed.
There would be a special fund called 'Sacred City Development Fund' and each kapumahattaya should contribute Rs. 2 million to this fund at the end of their months. The Basnayake Nilame had consented to contribute Rs. 50 million for each year.
This money would be utilized to construct houses and promote infrastructure facilities for low-income families in Katargama.

Lady Gaga postpones European tour due to health problems

Lady Gaga has rescheduled the European leg of her world tour due to ongoing health complications.
It comes after the singerpulled out of a performance at Brazil's Rock In Rio festivaland a show in Montreal after revealing she suffers from fibromyalgia.
"Lady Gaga is suffering from severe physical pain that has impacted her ability to perform," a statement from her label published on Monday reads.
"She remains under the care of expert medical professionals who recommended the postponement earlier today."
The 31-year-old singer also shared a message with fans on Instagram, saying she has been "searching for years to get to the bottom of" her condition.
"It is complicated and difficult to explain, and we are trying to figure it out," she said.
A documentary titled Gaga: Five Foot Two premiered last week at the Toronto Film Festival, explaining the singer's struggles with fibromyalgia, a condition which causes chronic pain all over the body.
"Lady Gaga is devastated that she has to wait to perform for her European fans," Monday's statement reads.
"She plans to spend the next seven weeks proactively working with her doctors to heal from this and past traumas that still affect her daily life, and result in severe physical pain in her body.
"She wants to give her fans the best version of the show she built for them when the tour resumes.
"Lady Gaga sends her love to all her fans across Europe and thanks them for their support and understanding."
The European leg of her Joanne World Tour was scheduled to last six weeks, starting at the end of September, and included five dates in the UK.
Since revealing her medical condition, the singer has been criticised online for being "dramatic".
"If you knew me, you would know this couldn't be further from the truth. I'm a fighter," she wrote.
"I use the word suffer not only because trauma and chronic pain have changed my life, but because they are keeping me from living a normal life.
"They are also keeping me from what I love the most in the world: performing for my fans."
The new dates for the European stint of the Joanne World Tour have yet to be confirmed.

Lees toughest fight immortalised in film
On a crisp December evening in 1960s California, two men near the peak of their powers locked horns in a battle that would go down in the annals of kung fu mythology.
On one side was a scrawny 24-year-old monk, newly arrived from eastern China, who exuded reserve and modesty despite being one of the fabled Shaolin Temples most skilled grand masters.
On the other: a brash, street-smart fighter of Chinese heritage but American birth  also 24  who was about to announce himself as the most iconic proponent of unarmed combat in history.
Birth of the Dragon showcases that epic face-off between Wong Jack Man and Bruce Lee, attempting to shine a light on a secretive and mysterious encounter that changed kung fu.
The handful of witnesses have never agreed on exactly what went down at Lees gym in Oakland that night  not the length of the confrontation, nor exactly how many people saw it, nor even who won.
What is undisputed is that the encounter transformed Lees approach to kung fu, setting him on the path to becoming The Dragon, a global superstar who introduced the until-then obscure martial art to world.
My father owns a martial arts school and he has a friend that was actually one of the witnesses, said Chinese-American action star Philip Ng, 39, who plays Lee and believes it was he who triumphed.
I heard his story and it contradicts some of the stuff that I read. I have my beliefs and my hypothesis about what happened in the fight but one thing that is definite is the fact that after this fight, Bruce Lee evolved his fighting methodology.
Set against the backdrop of 1964 San Francisco, Birth of the Dragon takes its inspiration from the classic movies Lee is known for, such as Fist of Fury and the posthumously released Enter the Dragon.
Legendary Shaolin monk Wong (Xia Yu), arrives in San Francisco to observe the state of kung fu in America and is immediately seen as a threat by Lee, who challenges him to the legendary duel.
Ng decided Lee was too well known for a straight-up impersonation to work, and instead created his own version, anchored on the fighters distinctive Hong Kong and 1960s San Francisco hippy slang accent.
The actor was born after Lees mysterious death from cerebral edema at the age of just 32, but believes he has been preparing, mostly unwittingly, to play the master his entire life. Ng  a prolific kung fu movie star in his own right  became proficient in Lees Wing Chun style in his native Hong Kong under Wong Shun Leung, the man credited with training Lee. He told me a lot of stories about Bruce Lee growing up, outside of kung fu and movies  things you cant read in books, said Ng. And working in Hong Kong for the last 15 years in action movies, Ive met a lot of people over the years who were close to Bruce.
Lee was noted for his generosity and sense of fairness, but George Nolfis movie invokes an arrogant yet gifted upstart who annoyed the Chinese masters with his insistence on teaching kung fu to Westerners and disrespecting its traditions. Hollywood News

In love with music
Sending positive and powerful vibes throughout the audience is what Anno Domini is all about. Shehan Perera, Band Leader of Anno Domini who believes music is all about love and passion reveals his story to Melodies.
Shehan Perera, who is a lawyer, says the band chose the name Anno Domini because it was catchy. Perera who has always had an interest in Latin names pointed out that it actually means in the year of our Lord. The band strongly believes in being honourable and values integrity. They also believe in being professional and going that extra mile. It is this sense of responsibility that really defines them. Trustworthiness, dependability and pride and love in what they do are on the top of their list of priorities.
We make sure the people who book us get the maximum out of it. We play exactly the way they would have wanted it. We cater to their musical tastes and also to the theme of the function. They must feel that they have got their moneys worth and should see that we have made a real effort, said Perera.
Pereras inspiration comes from many sources. He related a very touching story about how he wrote a song for his new born daughter which has not been recorded yet. Seeing her as a baby on the first day of her birth changed his life. That was an inspiration.
I have written a few songs, but we have not had a time to record them. We want to record some singles this year or at the start of next year. I have written a song for the band about being in music, making music and being in love with music. Music itself has been one of my inspirations along with life events and various other things, Perera stated.
Anno Domini is a band for all times. Their repertoire includes almost everything on request. They have made their name as a flexible and resilient band.
Predominantly we go as a pop band, but being a band in Sri Lanka we play all types. We do a lot of weddings as well and are known in the wedding circuit. So you need to play different types of music to suit the occasion, he said.
We play pop, jazz and retro as well. We play music from the 70s up to 2017. We play a lot of current songs and also play Bailas and Sinhalese pop songs. In Sri Lanka especially at a wedding you need to play everything as the audience expects all, Perera added. Anno Domini started as a group of friends and used to play as an acoustic outfit. The band is over 13 years now. Their first gig was at the World Trade Center. Starting out with four people, they had a packed audience every Friday, just playing acoustic music like Eagles, Beetles, Simon and Garfunkel. Having a great following, they thought they should cater to bigger events including weddings, corporate events and dinner dances. Perera points out that they were inspired and influenced by bands such as Beetles, Queen, the Eagle at the beginning. However now they have incorporated more songs into their repertoire such as Pit Bull.
In our music we always try to be positive. Positivity is the main message we want to convey. Different artistes have different ideas expressed in their music but we want to use music as a tool to promote positivity. We have enough of songs that focus on the negativity in the world. We want people to be happy when they listen to us. When we do weddings we want everyone to enjoy the event, and we want them to go away feeling happy. We want to spread the message that life is good. Life is something happy, Perera explained.
Love what you do, because if you do what you love, you will enjoy it, and if you enjoy it you will be successful. This may sound a clich but it is exactly what Pereras message is all about. If you enter music you have to do it because you love it and that should be your number one motive.
My message to anyone who enters music is that first you have to love what you do. If you love making music then go for it. However it can be lucrative as well. You should be professional about it and not let people down. If you are known as a responsible person or outfit, and you know how to respect your clients, then you can go far. Be mindful of peoples tastes and requirements, Perera said.
There is a perception in Sri Lanka that you do music because that is the only thing you can do. This is far from the truth. Anno Domini does music because it is their first love. Changing this perception is something Perera feels, is his duty. Music is a gift and it is a blessing to have music in your life. Not everyone can do it. Perera feels that musicians need to be respected as life would be boring without music. Music has added so much meaning to Pereras life as he even met his wife in a church choir. Music has being in his life now for 23 years. I am on the executive committee of the Western Musicians Association and we want to play our role in uplifting the standards of the music industry and help musicians to improve. We are thinking of an insurance scheme for musicians and a retirement plan as well. We are taking baby steps at the moment but we feel that it will be something great for the music industry, Perera said
Anno Domini has created strong bonds of friendship and built bridges. I have been in a choir for a long time. I have had the privilege of being trained by good voice trainers. I was part of the workshop players drama group directed by Jerome L. De Silva. For musicals we were trained by Mary Anne David and I had the privilege of learning under her.
I have sung for shows conducted by Ruwani Seimon and I was trained by her. As a child I also had the chance to train under Lylie Godridge. All of them have influenced me, Perera summed up.

Mercantile Investments and Finance has recorded a steady pre-tax profit of Rs 314 million and a post- tax profit of Rs 202 million for the financial year ending March 31, 2017.
However both pre and post-tax profits reported a notable decline of 61% and 60% respectively, when compared with the previous year mainly on account of recording impairment charges.
Further, as witnessed across the finance industry, the continued upward movement in interest rates and its resulting re-pricing effect impacted the cost of funding and core business margins which pegged back profitability levels against what was envisaged, Mercantile Investments and Finance Chairman Saro Weerasuriya told shareholders in companys Annual Report for the financial year 2016/17.
We experienced steady growth in our lending volumes which resulted in the loan book growing buoyantly by 14% year-on-year. In contrast, the deposit base grew moderately increasing by 8% year-on-year.
In the backdrop of rising market interest rates, we were conservative in the mobilisation of deposits that were deemed relatively more costly than other sources of funding available, and hence, we were able to access less costly sources of funding through borrowings on the strength of our brand.

The accelerated programme launched by the North Central Provincial Council to develop resources in the provincial education sector was standstill at present.
The programme was launched to construct and renovate classrooms and provide drinking water facilities to 810 schools in the province. Over Rs. 7,200 million was allocated last year for the Provincial Council to carry out the programme.
"We commenced infrastructural work at 503 schools in the province. We paid bills to the value of Rs. 1,620 million through the council funds to the contractors.
Again Rs. 1,007 million has to be paid, and we have not received funds from the Education Ministry as promised. Therefore, we have to abandoned 2,076 development projects at 503 schools and contractors have closed their work sites," NCP Chief Minister and Education Minister Peshala Jayaratne Bandara said. He said he requested the authorities to release the full allocation but they ignored the request. The Chief Minister said he would seek the intervention of the President if the situation continued.

Nearly 400 dengue deaths so far this year
A total of 390 dengue deaths and 151,975 dengue patients had been reported this year as at September 15.
About 68 percent of deaths are female dengue patients, the National Coordinator of the National Dengue Control Programme Dr. Hasitha Tissera said.
The National Mosquito Control Week will take place island-wide from September 20 to 26.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said only 32 percent of the total dengue deaths are male patients.
This is a new trend that should be studied. Out of the 390 dengue deaths, 197 had been reported from the Western Province. Over 50 percent of dengue deaths and patients had been reported from the Western Province, he said.
According to Dr. Tissera, in 2016, there were 98 dengue deaths and in 2015 there were 56 dengue deaths reported from Sri Lanka. About 85 percent of dengue deaths are those above the age of 15. A fever patient does not need to seek hospital admission during the first six hours of fever.
However, pregnant mothers need to consult their doctor on the first day, conduct a blood test and seek hospital admission if recommended by the doctor.
A seven-day mosquito control programme will be implemented in 44 Divisional Secretariat Divisions in 14 districts while a four-day mosquito control programme will be implemented in 144 Divisional Secretariat Divisions.
September 24, Sunday, will be allocated for cleaning campaigns and selling discarded items. A total of 3,000 teams will be deployed to inspect premises and they will be in uniforms carrying their official identity cards.
Three to five days will be given to clean mosquito breeding sites after issuing red notices, he added.

The Nice Guys : Amazing yet overlooked
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe reinvigorate this genre blending it with the best of the buddy comedy to make something truly unique. But the Nice Guys failed to rake at the box office. They more than made up for in great reviews. Gosling and Crowe carry the film with their rapport lending itself to quick-witted dialogue surprisingly hilarious physical comedy plus screenwriter and director Shane Black also wrote Lethal Weapon. The Quintessential buddy cop comedy. Breathing a new life into a retired genre the Nice Guys submits itself as a classic of days to come.
Ryan Gosling and Russell Crowe and is a story of two private detectives who are looking for a girl called named Amelia who is some wired way involved with a death of a porn star with some other several deaths being involved and its 1977. Basically the movie is these two unconventional characters getting to know each other.
Russell Crowe plays a tough guy and hes the kind of guy you hire maybe to beat somebody up whos following you. Hes not actually a private detective but sort of wishes he was. He fancies Himself a P.I. (Holland March) Ryan Goslings character actually is. The funny thing is Russell Crowes character (Jackson Healy) is probably better at his job even though hes not officially licensed.
I was super excited for this movie because Shane Black has written a very small amount of films and although I didnt love Iron Man 3. I enjoyed it. You can tell that Shane Black definitely understands where hes at home, writing buddy cop movies because the Nice Guys was probably one of my favourite movies of 2016. This is a fresh offbeat unconventional original witty comedy with two actors at the top their game. Their chemistry in this movie work like magic and not just because theyre funny play off each other well but also these characters feel at home with each other and yes that is a classic buddy-cop genre thing. What sort of reactions people had when you pair Chris Tucker and Jackie Chan. Oddly strange. When you pair Mel Gibson and Danny Glover Those people are two different opposing people. The difference here with these characters is that theyre not actually opposing. Theyre both have troubled pasts. They both have issues with alcohol. Theyre very similar in a lot of ways. They dont highly contract one another. Its the fact that they work together so well as a comedy team playing off each other thats so fresh and original.
The action is also great in this movie. Really great shootouts old 1980 style action film-making despite the fact that it takes place in the 70s that I must mention is perfectly well realized. I felt like I was watching a movie that came out in the 70s, but with better film stock. Its The Nice Guys is a perfect recapturing of a setting the mystery is appealing. So authentic this felt like the type of movie that wouldnt come out today like its just past its time. Hollywood doesnt make like these anymore. They rely on special effects, more explosions, more CGI but this movie is that type of movie that offers something great that would remind you why you love movies so much similar to Kiss Kiss Bang Bang There is also a fantastical vibe towards the final reel I couldnt get enough of its good characters, good dialogue, good story and great direction The Nice Guys is probably is one the best movie Ive seen last year.
The Nice Guys is a Lethal Weapon for a new generation.

No Arsenic in home food samples of Apura kidney patients
Laboratory tests conducted on food samples obtained from the homes of kidney patients in the Anuradhapura district has revealed that there is no Arsenic in them but contain dangerously high level of Lead, Dr. T. B. Ananda Jayalal Pediatric Nutrition, Environmental Technologist and WTO, SPS Trace Expert, Dr. T.B. Ananda Jayalal said.
Addressing a press conference at the Government Information Department Auditorium in Colombo yesterday, he said the study found Lead in 60 percent of blood samples tested for heavy metal.
The blood samples belong to both males and females of all ages. Of the 55 blood samples tested, 26 of them (47 percent) had Lead.
The Lead goes into the body through food and not through water. According to Dr. Jayalal, the amount of Lead going into the body through food can be controlled by using minimum fertilizer, not using pesticides and insecticides, not eating the same food all the time, eating different types of food and eating more fish and meat (but not the liver), etc.
A vegetarian diet cannot be recommended.
The food we consume more such as rice (paddy) can be cultivated in non affected (polluted with heavy metal) lands while the food we eat less such as chilies can be cultivated in affected lands,he said.
When the children consume Lead beyond tolerable levels, their growth gets affected and their IQ level becomes low.
Their hearing also gets affected.
When the adults get ingested with Lead, they get high blood pressure, low hemoglobin levels, consciousness issues etc. Sri Lanka stands in the 79th place in the world when it comes to the IQ level in the population, he added.

No change in trade policy towards Sri Lanka - US
The US has stressed that there shall be no major change in its trade policy towards Sri Lanka in the aftermath of its new administration -and hinted on stronger economic relations in future based on the bedrock US-Sri Lanka.
The Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) was inked in Washington in 2002, to which Colombo consented readily on September 18.
It is tough to predict the future, stressed the Washington DC based visiting new Assistant US Trade Representative South and Central Asian Affairs Office of the US Trade Representative Mark Linscott in Colombo.
Assistant US Trade Representative Linscott met with Sri Lankan Ministry of Industry and Commerce Team led by Secretary of Ministry of Industry and Commerce Chinthaka Lokuhetti representing Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen.
It is tough to predict the future. The new US administration has a significant shift in change towards several of its trade agreements-mainly the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal; and there is a big focus on re-negotiating NAFTA as well as correcting our current trade deficits too, said Assistant US Trade Representative Linscott, and added: Despite this I am not expecting any significant changes in US bilateral trade with Sri Lanka or our Trade and Investment Framework Agreement (TIFA) with Sri Lanka.
Being a hub in the region, this is a remarkably exciting time for Sri Lanka and we share the interest in working with Sri Lanka and exploiting its natural advantages for better trade.
We are looking to move on from the past and create a special (trade) plan for Sri Lanka on TIFA. A real example is using trade to increase economic growth. We too definitely want to see TIFAs follow up on the progress achieved in Washington. I appreciate this frank exchange of ideas with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in my first visit to Sri Lanka.

Parliamentarians angst with a new edge
Worldwide, it appears that parliamentarians are struggling to meet the ever growing expectations of citizens. Data suggests that citizens hold parliamentarians to account principally for the services that they are able to deliver outside parliament, not for their law-making role or their ability to oversee the Executive.
Constituency service is the general term for what parliamentarians do to serve and represent the interests of their constituents. Constituency service exists in many different forms, both in constituency-based electoral systems and also in list-based systems. Discussions with parliamentarians show the extent to which their capacity to deliver is being stretched to the limit, and might be taking them away from their parliamentary duties.
On the contrary, its a pity to see that some of the honourable Members of Parliament elected by the people do not make use of the August Assembly to speak good and bad of the government.
They make it a stage outside parliament to speak the same matter and entirely different and contradictory points then. It is to mislead people who elect them or are they thinking people are not brave enough to understand what calibre they are
There are so many to do and speak of the burning agonies to solve when they meet their kith and kin, the loyal voters, instead of talking rubbish.

Path before Pathi
Dr Dharmasena Pathiraja represents a rare breed of artistes in our country who have the power to bequeath wisdom in peoples minds.
Pathiraja in his cinematic works have exceeded the trend set by Dr Lester James Peries to produce more realistic cinema that had a kind of penetration into deep issues in the society and reality.
Pathis cinema was largely inspired by French new wave and Polish and East European films.
He was branded as a left bank (Wam Ivura) filmmaker in the 70s decade since his cinema was focused on urban lower middle-class youth who challenged a capitalist system and yearned for equality among people.
Once he told the Daily News, My political ideology too was socialist oriented. I was a leftist from my schooling days. While at Dharmaraja College, I used to listen to speeches of Dr N M Perera, Dr Colvin R de Silva and Bernad Soyza with much interest. While in the university, my batch mates used to call me a Trotskyite.
Although Pathi branded himself as a filmmaker in his heydays as an artiste, he was a resourceful playwright at the inception.
Pathi had studied theatre while in Peradeniya University. He obtained his Masters degree by writing his thesis on; Sinhala Naatye Aakruthiya Haa Anthargathaya Athara Aragalaya (The struggle between form and content in Sinhala theater).
On graduating from Peradeniya University with an Honours degree in Sinhala and Western Classical Culture in 1967, he had lectured on Drama and Performing Arts subsequent to obtaining a PhD in Bengali cinema from the Monash University.
Three books written by Pathi on his plays; Kora Saha Andhaya (The Crippled and the Blind Man), Putu (translation of the play, The Chairs by Eugene Ionesco) and Vankagiriya (original script) was launched at the Mahaweli Center, Colombo.
In his original play; Kora Saha Andhaya actors Daya Tennakoon and late Vimal Kumar de Costa had brought in a memorable performance.
This play which had been scripted by Pathi himself and directed by late Dhamma Jagoda decades back was later produced by Janakaraliya with the blessings of the veteran Parakrama Niriella.
Pathis direction Putu (The Chairs) had clinched the award for the best translated script at the 1971 State drama festival.
Kapila Kumara Kalinga in his speech said Putu made to the absurd drama genre was not understood by the general audience but Kora Saha Andhaya was a super hit.
When Pathi shifted to cinema, he induced this absurd genre to his cinema too and Bambaru Awith, Paara Digae and Soldadu Unnehae are good examples. Yet Pathi was branded as a Trotskyite or a Marxist based on his cinema. His latest film too was based on script by Kafka but on the other hand Eugene Ionesco was a hardcore anti-Marxist. This is the irony of Pathis creative nature. He believed a filmmaker does not necessarily have to stick to one particular genre to position him. Pathi instead believed in using the most appropriate rhythm to make a particular cinema or drama, said Kalinga.
Dr Saumya Liyanage made a short but insightful speech on Pathis dramas and his contribution to the Sri Lankan theater.
Prof Carlo Fonseka in his keynote speech said, in addition to being a University Don, a dramatist and a filmmaker, Pathi was a resourceful lyricist and a song like Sumudu Sayanae is testament to his prowess as a lyricist.
I see Pathi as a philosopher whose medium was Art. He was very sensitive towards changes taking place in the society, said the Prof.
He added, The Exposition, Rising action, The climax, Falling action and Denouement or Resolution being five basic stages aka Five-act-structure of a stage drama is used as the base to develop most plays, way back from Aristotles time. Even a Shakespearean drama like Romeo and Juliet was built on these five pillars. But Dharmasena Pathirajas Kora Saha Andhaya had deviated from this Norm yet magically was able to keep the audience at the edge of their seats.
The Prof continued to say, In this original story, Pathi talks of a cripple person and a blind man who come to consensus to seek for greener pastures with mutual help. I tried to understand this drama by putting it in a mould with three aspects; religion, art and science. Buddhist philosophy helped me to understand what was unfolding on stage depicted as Kora Saha Andhaya. People in this world are born with Loba, Dvesha and Moha and these attributes are wrapped in this 32 minute short drama in a magical manner, said Prof Fonseka.

Plunkett up for Gayle contest
Chester-le-Street: England fast bowler Liam Plunkett is excited by the prospect of facing West Indies' big-hitter Chris Gayle in an upcoming one-day international series.
Veteran left-handed opener Gayle gave England a taste of what they can expect in the five-match ODI clash with a typically rapid 40 as World Twenty20 champions West Indies beat England by 21 runs in the lone T20 international of their tour in Durham on Saturday.
A sell-out crowd were rewarded for braving a cold and rainswept night in Chester-le-Street by the sight of Gayle smashing three fours and four sixes in just 21 balls.
It was a reminder that the 37-year-old Jamaican has lost none of his power at the crease and England are preparing for more of the same when the ODI campaign starts at Old Trafford on Tuesday.
"I don't think anyone knows (how to bowl to Gayle) do they" said Plunkett. "He's such a good player he just hits the ball out of the park wherever he wants."
None of the West Indies side that played on Saturday featured during their recent 2-1 Test series loss in England.
But the likes of Gayle, Marlon Samuels and Jerome Taylor, who missed the Test series because of a clash with the Caribbean Premier League Twenty20 tournament and the legacy of a bitter dispute with Cricket West Indies chiefs, are now back in the fold.
"It's good they have their experienced players back, a lot of stars, and that's what you want to play against," said 32-year-old Plunkett.
"You want to beat the best they can bring over."
While the West Indies also have two World Cup titles behind them, England have yet to win a major global one-day international trophy, with the 2010 World Twenty20 in the Caribbean their lone piece of International Cricket Council silverware.
But England are a much-improved ODI side since their woeful first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup in Australia and New Zealand.
"In one-dayers we're a good team, we haven't won any silverware obviously but in terms of the last two years with the amount of games and series we are a confident team," Plunkett said.
"We feel like we should beat them (West Indies)."
Meanwhile, Plunkett could yet become the leading wicket-taker in one-day internationals this year.
He has taken 28 wickets in 13 ODIs in 2017, with Afghanistan's Rashid Khan (36 wickets) and Pakistan's Hasan Ali (31) topping the list for the calendar year to date.
The Yorkshireman took three for 27 on Saturday and now looks to be increasingly settled at international level following a stop-start England career.
Plunkett made his England debut back in 2005 but it is only in the past two years that he has become a white-ball regular.
"I'm quite comfortable in my own skin with England now," he said.
"It's good to have that feeling and it would be great to be the number one wicket-taker. "It would be great to achieve that but also good to win the series." AFP

PM at former President J.R. Jayewardenes 111th birth anniversary commemoration: JRJs introduction of open economy provided economic momentum to other Asian countries
It was former President J.R.Jayewardene who introduced an open economy in Sri Lanka, the first Asian nation to do so. But the country was unable to yield the best results of his endevour due to terrorism that engulfed the country, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said most of the Asian countries that opened their economies after studying Sri Lanka have achieved economic development.
The Prime Minister said that three and half decades ago the United States, Canada, the UK, the Soviet Union and other European countries were the economic powers of the world with Japan being the only country from the orient to be in this elite club.
"But now China, India, South Korea, Singapore, Malaysia and some South East Asian countries are among the countries with economic power," the Prime Minister said. "It is predicted that economic power will completely shift to the Asian countries in the near future".
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was speaking as Chief Guest at the 111th birth anniversary commemoration of late President and UNP leader J.R.Jayewardene at the J.R.Jayewardene Centre yesterday.
The Prime Minister further said the open economy was the main reason for economic power to shift to the East from the Western countries.

"It was J.R.Jayewardene who was one of the first Asian leaders to introduce an open economy," the Premier said. "He was bold enough to do so in 1977 just a few months after coming to power. Later,China, India, South Korea, Vietnam etc opened up their economies after studying developments in Sri Lanka. Special representatives came to Sri Lanka to study how we brought in foreign investments," the Prime Minister said.
Premier Wickremesinghe said most of the Asian countries achieved economic development,but,Sri Lanka could not yield the best results due to terrorism which plagued the country.
He added that even global military power too is seeing a shift from the West to the East. The Prime Minister said that although the US, UK and other European countries are strong military powers, Asian countries such as China,Japan and India have have gained momentum military strength.
The Prime Minister also said that J.R.Jayewardene took measures to construct the Mahaweli Project which was bigger than all the reservoirs that were constructed by ancient kings.
Late President J.R.Jayewardene's grandson Amrith Jayewardene garlanded his statue.
Ministers Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, John Amarathunga, Akila Viraj Kariyawasam and Chandrani Bandara and MP Ravi Karunanayake also participated at the event. Dr.Saroja Wettasinghe made the key note address.

Presidents Committee fails, GMOA to strike
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) will go ahead with all pre-planned trade union action pertaining to the SAITM issue because no people friendly solution had been given to the issue through the committee appointed by the President, GMOA Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said. Addressing a press conference held at the GMOA Head Quarters in Colombo yesterday, he said an island wide persisting national strike has been planned by the GMOA along with the other organisations of the Anti SAITM Peoples Barricade on September 21st. The GMOA Executive Committee has granted permission to go ahead with it.
According to Dr. Aluthge, Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) should immediately announce its stand on SAITM after considering the committee report and the media release issued by the Presidents Media Unit. The entire country is waiting for the response of the SLMC. The GMOA has appointed a committee headed by GMOA Vice President Dr. Sanjeewa Thennakoon in order to study the committee report and the media release.
The committee has totally rejected all the requests made by several parties demanding a people friendly solution.The committee is purely aimed at legalising SAITM ignoring all the requests made by the GMOA, State Medical Faculty Deans, Lecturers attached to state Medical Faculties, students, unions, parents unions etc. The committee report deny its facts by itself and the committee is illegal because it was presented by others and not by the persons appointed by the President, he added.

## Title: The pros and cons of PR
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial

The pros and cons of PR
President Maithripala Sirisena has quite rightly welcomed the reintroduction of the old electoral system, where parliamentarians and local government representatives were elected by majority vote, or, first past the post system, as is commonly known. Addressing local SLFP organisers of the North Central Province, the President said the proportional representation system has bred a brand of politicians who were selfish and worked to foster their own self interests rather than for the country. He said he was happy to see the introduction of electorate-based voting system, fulfilling the people's expectation, under his leadership, disregarding protests by certain disgruntled factions. Reverting to the old electoral system was also a pledge made at the election by the Common Candidate.
The PR system, no doubt, has its pluses. Minority political parties and those parties on the fringes of power largely benefited from the system. It is such parties that want the status quo to prevail. The PR voting system, no doubt, vastly benefitted the JVP, which managed to secure nearly 40 seats at the 2004 General Election, contesting under the banner of the UPFA. Had this been an election held under first the past the post system, the JVP members, who, eventually got elected to parliament, would have been elbowed out by the SLFP candidates, or, in a most unlikely scenario, field their candidates under a No Contest pact with the UPFA.
Minority parties were the other beneficiaries under the PR system, facilitating their entry to parliament in their numbers. Had it been the old system, no member of the CWC would have entered parliament, testified by the fact that only Thondaman senior got elected to the legislature at the 1977 election, and, that too, as third member, behind Gamini Dissanayake and Anura Bandaranaike. (In the case of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress, and the TNA, the situation was somewhat different, contesting as they do, under religious or communal labels, where Muslims (in the East) and Tamils (North) are contiguous). Hence, it could be seen why minority parties are loath to see the exit of the PR system.
On the other side of the coin, PR has promoted, not only a murderous political culture in the south, but also facilitated the entry of undesirables and the uncouth into the supreme legislature of the country. The cutthroat competition, at the elections, has pitted, not only members of one political party against rival party members, but also led to home and home matches, where, contestants of the same party went for each others jugular. Candidates who are unable to muster massive financial resources, given that the orbit is the entire district, rather than a single electorate, have as much chance of getting elected as a snowball in hell. What is more, the system had spawned the entry of bootleggers, drug lords and shady businessmen, into the equation, to bankroll candidates, in return for the usual quid pro quo.
That is why the President said the system has bred a brand of politicians, who are selfish and content at only massing wealth, leaving the public in the lurch. The PR system also left a swath of electorates sans a representative, such as the Colombo district, which has 15 electorates. Even the Moneragala district, which has only three electorates, although the largest district in the country, area wise, more often than not is bereft of representatives for any one among the Moneragala, Wellawaya or Bibile electorates, either from the governing party or the opposition, leaving the people a neglected lot.
On the other hand, the old system had the local man, or, gamey miniha, representing both parties, to choose from, and whoever wins the electorate is guaranteed of a people's representatives in parliament to serve their needs.
The return of the old electoral system, hopefully would see the entry of professionals and the educated into the political arena. Needless to say, the cultured and decent shunned electoral politics, given the cesspit into which present day politics had plunged into. True, there was the National List to accommodate eminent personages. But with rare exceptions such as Lakshman Kadirgamar, Prof. G.L. Peiris Malik Samarawickrama, Tilak Marapana et al. the National List had all along been abused, to accommodate political rejects and clowns.
Be that as it may, measures should also be taken to ensure minority parties are not excluded from the legislature as a result of doing away with the PR system. Some form of mechanism should be brought in not to entirely deny these parties parliamentary representation. The proposed mixed system to go hand in hand with the old electoral system could well be the solution. It should be borne in mind that the JVP staged it's second uprising after JRJ's referendum denied it the opportunity for parliamentary representation. The party, certainly, would have returned quite a few MPs, given the dynamics of the PR system and the bloodbath that followed could have been averted. The same goes for parties such as the CWC and Up Country Peoples Front, that command a sizable vote in the plantations. All measures should be taken to ensure no party, community or political group gets alienated from the political mainstream.

Rohingya crisis: Suu Kyi does not fear global 'scrutiny'

Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi says she does not fear "international scrutiny" of her government's handling of the growing Rohingya crisis.
It was her first national address on the violence in northern Rakhine state that has seen more than400,000 Rohingya Muslims cross into Bangladesh.
She said that most Muslims had not fled the state and that violence had ceased.
Suu Kyi has faced heavy criticism for her response to the crisis.
The current spate of violence began in August when there was an armed attack on police posts, blamed on Rohingya militants.
That lead to a massive security crackdown by the military, which the UN's human rights chief later called a "textbook example of ethnic cleansing".
Rohingya Muslims started leaving in vast numbers crossing into Bangladesh with tales of their villages were being burned and saying were facing persecution at the hands of the military.
The military says its operations in the northern Rakhine state are aimed at rooting out militants, and denies targeting civilians.
Access is restricted to the area, but on a government-controlled trip for journalists the BBC found reason to question the official narrative that Muslims were setting fire to their own villages.
Suu Kyi said she was making this speech because she was unable to travel to the UN General Assembly later this week.
She said she wanted the international community to know what was being done by her government to address the situation.
"We condemn all human rights violations and unlawful violence. We are committed to the restoration of peace and stability and rule of law throughout the state," Suu Kyi said in her address in the capital, Nay Pyi Taw.
She did not address the allegations against the military, saying only that there had been "no armed clashes or clearance operations" since 5 September.
In a comment being widely criticised by observers, Suu Kyi said most Muslims had decided to stay in Rakhine and that indicated the situation may not be so severe.
She said she wanted to speak to both Muslims that had fled and those that had stayed to find out what was at the root of the crisis.
Suu Kyi has earlier claimed that the narrative was being distorted by a"huge iceberg of misinformation"and said tensions were being fanned by fake news promoting the interests of terrorists.
While Suu Kyi is the de facto head of the civilian government of Myanmar, also known as Burma, it is the military which holds real power in Rakhine state as it is in charge of internal security.

The government yesterday said that it has never deviated from prescribed procedures in dealing with Rohingya refugees.
Internal Affairs, Wayamba Development and Cultural Affairs Ministry Secretary D. Swarnapala in a release said the government has acted within the legal framework when dealing with the Rohingya refugees.
The statement: "It is observed that numerous groups have been expressing divergent views over the past few days with regard to the situation that has developed in Myanmat and the Rohingya refugees.
"A group of 55 Rohingyas fleeing from Myanmar was rescued mid sea by Sri Lankan Navy on March 03,2008 and handed over to the UNHRC. All these refugees have left Sri Lanka in July 2012. In February 2013, the Navy had once again rescued in the mid sea refugees who travelled by two boats - one boat carrying 138 and the other with 32 refugees who were handed over to the UNHRC. They too had left the Island in November 2015.
"On April 30, 2017, the Navy had rescued 30 Rohingyas, including 17 children, seven women and also a pregnant woman faced with danger to life in a boat near Sri Lanka.
They were handed over to the UNHCR after completing the court proceedings related to refugees.
The government has acted within the approved legal framework and never deviated from the prescribed procedures and will act under the previously approved procedure in future too."

Seafood exports increase after EU ban removal

Sri Lankas seafood exports have recorded a 40 percent growth during past six months due to the lifting of the ban on fish exports by the European Union.
According to the economic statics of the Central Bank the demand for Sri Lankan seafood exports in the global market has increased tremendously.
The country has earned Rs 12.9 million US Dollars through seafood exports in June 2016 and it has increased to 15.2 million US Dollars in June this year.
Earnings in the first six months of 2016 were 83.5 million US Dollars, while in the corresponding period this year it reached 117 million US Dollars.
The revenue received from fisheries exports this year in comparison to the first six months of last year was 40.3 per cent.
Commenting on this, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said that Sri Lanka has not yet been able to meet the demand for fisheries exports in the international market and the country has achieved only the one third of the demand.
The Minister further added that the government has already taken measures to enhance fisheries production with the intention of meeting the demand.

SL Purchasing Managers Index (PMI) Survey  August 2017: Manufacturing Sector PMI records 54.4 in August
The Manufacturing Sector PMI recorded 54.4 in August which is a slight increase of 0.1 index points compared to July 2017.
The increase was driven by the increase in the Stock of purchases sub-index due to slow progress in production activities during the month and maintaining buffer stocks to cater to the already received new orders to be supplied in the future.
Suppliers Delivery Time lengthened mainly due to some company specific constraints. The Employment sub-index contracted due to the difficulties in finding unskilled employees in the market to address high labour turnover, especially in the apparel sector.
However, all the sub-indices apart from the Employment sub-index of PMI recorded values above the neutral 50.0 threshold signalling an overall expansion in August. Moreover, the Expectation for activities remain positive for the next three months.
The Services Sector PMI recorded 60.1 index points in August from 59.1 index points in July 2017.
This indicates that the Services sector continued to expand in August 2017 compared to July 2017 driven by New Businesses, Business Activity and Expectations for Activity. Employment Level increased at a slower rate while Backlogs of Work declined in August 2017 compared to July 2017.
Financial and Telecommunication sectors contributed to the expansion in New Businesses and Business Activity through introduction/expansion of technological reach to serve their clients and to improve efficiency of their services.
The Accommodation, Food and Beverage sector also reported an increase in Business Activity. Prices Charged sub-index experienced an increase, mainly in Accommodation, Food and Beverage sector due to seasonal demand. Meanwhile, Expectations on Labour Cost sub-index continued to decline in August 2017.

Discussions were focused on enhancing relations with Sri Lanka in the electric/electronic sector, specifically and exploring possible collaboration in areas such as trade, tourism, technical cooperation, education and culture.
On September 5, a B2B session for the delegation was organized by the Embassy with the assistance of the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Vietnam, the Vietnam Electronic Industries Association, the Vietnam Chamber of Commerce Industry (VCCI), the Embassy of the Republic of Korea in Ha Noi and Korean Chamber of Commerce in Vietnam.
Making the opening remarks for the B2B session, Dissanayake, indicated that the event is a beginning of a new chapter in the cooperation of the electronic and electrical industry of both countries and hoped that it would expand to other sectors in the future. Around 40 Vietnamese companies participated the session.
The Sri Lankan delegation also participated in a working session arranged by the Investment Promotion Center - North Vietnam (IPCN) of the Foreign Investment Agency (FIA). A comprehensive presentation was made on how and why Vietnam has become an attractive investment destination for foreign investors, as well as available opportunities. Officials from the Vietnam Investment Development Group also attended the session.
The Delegation also met senior officials of the Vietnam Research Institute of Electronics, Informatics and Automation (VIELINA), a research and development institution in the field of electronics, informatics and automation coming under the purview of the Ministry of Industry and Trade. Officials agreed to support Sri Lankan electronic and electrical companies upon requests from the Sri Lankan side.
This visit could be considered as a significant visit representing the electronic and electrical industry of Sri Lanka to Vietnam and it marked an important milestone in the cooperation between the industries of the two countries.

Some media channels criticise highway to sabotage it: Kirella
During the last couple of weeks, some media organisations continuously criticise the Central Highway Project to sabotage it, Leader of the house, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said.
He was speaking at the inauguration ceremony in Kandy of the 9th stage of Marga Development Project in Pathadumbara, Pubuduwa recently. The ceremony was organised by the Higher Education and Highways Ministry and the Road Development Authority.
Minister Kiriella said some people of the area were against the highway project since they were unable to implement the project although they were in power more than two decades.
"Madam Chandrika was in power for 10 years and Mahinda Rajapaksa for 10 years. But they could not make it a success. The Prime Minister replied to all the allegations made by some media and the opposition in Parliament last week," the Minister said.
"A media channel asks what is the value of the project. These are very silly and low type of queries and the Government has no time to answer them. They discourage investors. We must make them understand that the Colombo-Kandy highway project gives immense benefits to the people. It is a sin to sabotage the highway. People can visit Dalada Maligawa easily along the highway, the Minister said.

Sri Lanka Tourism  deepens its reach in Germany
Sri Lanka Tourism conducted B2B (business to business) meetings in four German cities starting from September 12-15.
This tourism promotional activity provides an opportunity to position Sri Lanka as a preferred destination in Asia. The travel and leisure industry of Sri Lanka serving the German market met with potential German outbound tour operators across Germany to establish new partnerships.
Sri Lanka has been a favorable long haul destination among German travelers for the last few decades.
Jrgen Becker of BCD Travel in Cologne said that after travelling to Sri Lanka in the 1980s he was quite excited to go back next year and explore the changes in the country. After his experience back then, he recommends a visit Sri Lanka, nevertheless. The European market continues to remain important to Sri Lanka as Europeans are high spenders with a longer duration of stay.
The roadshow kicked off in Cologne on September12 and continued till September 15, covering Dortmund, Hannover and Bremen too. This further widens the reach in Germany after the series of roadshows conducted nearly a year ago, which included Munich, Stuttgart, Frankfurt, Dusseldorf, Hamburg and Berlin.
Karunasena Hettiarachchi, Sri Lanka Ambassador in Germany, Honorary Consul General of Consulate of Sri Lanka in Cologne and Dortmund addressed the audience and shared the vision of tourism, the long-standing relationship between the two governments and the strong democracy of Sri Lanka.
The destination promotional presentation made by Sri Lanka Tourism Promotion Bureau Managing Director Sutheash Balasubramaniam highlighted the diversity, authenticity and compactness to position Sri Lanka in the minds of German participants as a unique destination in Asia.
Jessica Weyers of Reisebro Weyers said, It is really an alternative for those who already know the Caribbean Islands and South East Asia and the most important thing is that it is suitable for all ages.
"These positive endorsements from the participants highlight the potential which Sri Lanka has as a leading tourist destination which contributes immensely to the growth of the tourism sector.

St Louis protests turn violent; over 80 arrested
US: A largely peaceful rally in St Louis turned rowdy on Sunday as a handful of demonstrators protesting at the acquittal of a white police officer over the fatal shooting of a black man in 2011 threw bottles in response to police making arrests.
Hundreds of people gathered for the third night in a row in the Missouri city of almost 320,000 people.
Violence erupted the previous two nights, evoking memories of the riots following the 2014 shooting of a black teenager by a white officer in nearby Ferguson, Missouri.
More than 80 people were arrested as police in riot gear used pepper spray and arrested the demonstrators who had defied orders to disperse following a larger, peaceful protest.
At a late-night news conference, Mayor Lyda Krewson noted that the vast majority of protesters are non-violent, and blamed the trouble on a group of agitators.
Sundays event began peacefully, just like the previous two nights.
Then a police officer was making two arrests a block away from police headquarters, leading some to rush toward the officer, who then jumped in his car and reversed quickly through the crowd to get away, according to journalists.
Nobody was injured, but the crowd started confronting a police line, and some people threw bottles.
The St Louis police department said it had received reports of significant property damage on Sunday night and had ordered crowds to disperse in the area of Tucker and Pine.
Jason Stockley, the officer who shot dead Anthony Lamar Smith in 2011, has told a city newspaper he was just not the guy to blame.
During demonstrations on Friday night, police said 32 people were arrested and 10 officers injured.
Late on Saturday in the Delmar Loop area of University City, a suburb about 10 miles west of downtown St Louis known for concert venues and night life, a group of demonstrators refused to disperse, broke windows and threw objects at police. Officers moved in with riot gear and armoured vehicles and the disturbances resulted in several arrests.
In a Facebook post early on Sunday, Missouri governor Eric Greitens wrote: Saturday night, some criminals decided to pick up rocks and break windows. They thought theyd get away with it. They were wrong. Our officers caught em, cuffed em, and threw em in jail.
In the past, our leaders let people break windows, loot, start fires.
They let them do it. Not this time.
Tonight, the police arrested the vandals. At this moment, theyre all sitting in a jail cell. Theyre gonna wake up and face felony charges.- AFP

Sweet or bitter: The tea train evokes colonial legacy
Anniversary celebrations offer reflections on British rule and home-grown success
Just as the Sri Lankan capital stirs, the Podi Menike, or Little Maiden, creaks and groans as it pulls out of Colombo Fort Station. The train is bound for Badulla, 290 km away at the southeastern edge of the island's hill country. The 5:55 Menike was part of my life in the early 1990s, when I lived for two years in Nuwara Eliya, a chilly, mist-draped town 1,868 meters up in the mountains.
I recently boarded the Menike for the 10-hour ride to visit Ella, a stop near Badulla. I was heading there to report on the recent interest that globe-trotting millennials had taken in the town. They are drawn to the place for the treks through its tea-covered slopes; the train also features heavily in their social media posts. The Menike's first stretch out of Colombo is through a tropical tangle of low land urban and rural life. The journey serves up ample scenes of a habit embraced during British colonial rule. Sun-drenched Sri Lankan streets are dotted with tea shops, often crowded during the breakfast hours and when people take a midmorning break for a cup of tea. Add to this a break for afternoon tea at around 3 p.m., and the national rhythm of tea-drinking life on the South Asian island is almost complete.
But there is more to this very British legacy. This year marks the 150th anniversary of the first crop grown commercially on a small tea estate near the old royal city of Kandy, up in the hills. And the Sri Lankan government and industry leaders have brewed a special celebration -- a Global Ceylon Tea Party. From January through August, the best teas from Ceylon, as the country was formerly called, are being served up at the country's diplomatic missions across the world.
Fourth largest tea exporter
Sri Lanka is currently the world's fourth largest exporter of tea, but the anniversary celebration is also an occasion for reflection that goes beyond simply celebrating the commodity that put the island on the world map. Ultranationalists among the majority Sinhalese have made sniping at the British Raj something of a national pastime. Even tea has been thrown into the pot. They attack the land policies imposed by the colonial rulers to command tracts of the hill country for tea cultivation. How much longer will they remain bitter
Fortunately, a journey on the Menike through the heart of tea country provides a window on the progress made by another group of Sri Lankans.
They have built on the pioneering efforts of James Taylor, the young Scottish planter who first experimented with a commercial tea crop on his Kandy estate in 1867.
They are behind the spread of the evenly pruned tea trees that cover sweeping stretches of mountain slopes shimmering in the sunlight. Smallholder tea farmers today account for 65% of the 320 million kg of black tea produced every year in Sri Lanka -- meaning they alone produce far more than what the British-dominated plantation companies could manage when the island gained independence in 1948.
British engineering
Yet they are not the only ones who have made a virtue of the Raj's success at controlling nature and imposing rules to convert mist-covered mountains, some above 2,000 meters, into productive land. Even the Menike -- a feat of British engineering -- is part of this legacy. The first train chugged up to Kandy in the year of Taylor's commercial tea triumph. And as the Raj spread tea plantations across the rugged and chilly hills, the train tracks followed to carry the commodity to Colombo Port. The journey today still offers scenes tailor-made for a period film of life during the British Raj. As the Menike winds its way along steep mountainsides, it stops at small stations that look like English country cottages. In some, the white-uniformed stationmaster still manually operates instruments to ensure the trains run on time, embracing to the last toot this British legacy.

Unhindered relief for drought affected: Anuradhapura GA
Food rations and drinking water are being distributed to the drought affected farmer families in the Anuradhapura district without hindrance, Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake told the Daily News.
He said 141,328 farmer families would receive a dry food ration worth Rs. 2,500 each under the 2nd phase of the programme. Already 2,500 families in the Mahavilachchiya Divisional Secretariat Division were provided the relief and other 21 DS Divisions would receive the relief this week, he said.
Under the first phase, 157,503 families were to receive the relief. But the Disaster Management Ministry assisted by the GA Anuradhapura and District Secretaries have reduced the number to 141,328 families after re-examining their eligibility for the relief. Many names were deleted from the list as they have neglected the social work that they were asked to engage in for five days per month in a work site noted by the GA. Wanninayaka said water distribution was limited to 11,010 families in 64 Grama Niladhari divisions in the district since the areas now receive rains.
He said 70,000 persons in 27,000 families in 18 DS divisions were provided with drinking water through water bowsers.
The GA said every drought affected family would be provided with drinking water. Pipe borne water is suplied to nearly three lakhs of people in the Anuradhapura city and the suburb through Nuwarawewa, Tisawewa and Thuruvila. He said around 40.000 cubic meters of purified water was pumped from the tanks daily.
Major reservoirs received a low quantity of water despite the rain. The water level of the Nuwarawewa reservoir rose only four inches with the rain, Wanninayake said.
The Mahaweli Water Control Committee and the Mahaweli Authority have taken steps to pump 5,000 acre feet of Mahaweli water to the tanks via the Kalawewa and Nachchaduwa, the AG said.

V Leaking Chemistry paper questions: Tuition master, his brother released on bail
The tuition master and his brother, who were alleged to have published leaflets containing questions from the 2017 G.C.E. Advanced Level Chemistry paper, were released on bail yesterday by the Gampaha Magistrate.
The Police arrested the tuition master after carrying out investigations into the distribution of the handout near a leading school in Gampaha which contained several questions that appeared in the exact form as in the second A/L Chemistry question paper.
A 19-year-old student was later arrested for allegedly leaking the Chemistry paper to the tuition master. The student's father too was arrested afterward for allegedly aiding in the crime. They were both remanded.
The Police said the father of the student suspect is a doctor at the Police Hospital in Narahenpita. It is alleged that the student used an electronic device smuggled into the examination hall to leak questions of the paper to his chemistry teacher while the exam was ongoing, in return for answers.

Walk the word
Travelling back and forth between his home and the hospital in Maharagama was strenuous enough. With his father in a struggle between life and death, it turned out to be even worse. Plus, he had to take decisions  the most crucial ones. The stress engine has revved up to the full throttle.
But then that bundle of anxiety, stress, depression and weariness led him to a Shangri-La.
He began writing. That exercise came as a relief to rise above the adverse emotions. He sat down and went on writing. All that came to him spontaneously. And thats how an Ashok Ferrey was born at the age of 42 to the Sri Lankan English literary sphere.
His latest work of fiction, The Ceaseless Chatter of Demons, has been longlisted for two international prizes: The DSC Prize longlist (the last 13 out of 60+ entries) and the Atta Galatta Bangalore Lit Fest Prize (the last 11 out of 120 entries).
The book will also be translated and published in France early next year, making it only the second indigenous Sri Lankan novel to have this honour  the first being Martin Wickremesinghes Viragaya, over 50 years ago. There have been a few expatriate writers of Sri Lankan origin whose novels have been translated and published in France. But they have been Sri Lankans who live in the UK, US, Australia and Canada, and are citizens of the respective countries - so not strictly speaking indigenous.
All this goes to show that Sri Lankan English writing is slowly and quietly making its way onto the world stage, Ferrey comments.
I write well when I am sad. Sometimes it is just the right mood when I cannot sleep. You can never write well when basked in luxuries. In day-to-day life, we dont find much peace. We should be able to blur everything else and zone in on our job. We need to be in the zone amid all that chaos of the surrounding, Ferrey notes on writing.
But then he climbs on to another concept: the unconditioned mind, a must for a writer. Someone who had been starving for days would jump at whatever the food on hand. You might even wolf down cotton. But once hunger is satisfied you tend to have reservations about the very same food on your hand. You may not prefer chicken. A particular vegetable might be too sour. In such occurences, you cannot savour the real flavour.
The writer, in a similar vein, shall cultivate the habit of seeing things as they are. An individual is an individual; his profession and other matters are simply mundane. Without a conditioned mindset, the writer can observe an individual or a thing within a full scope.
From the unconditioned mindset, Ferrey descends to his home turf: writing.
When you are under stress, everything else comes to a rest, he reminds us. It applies to rewriting as well. But wait up, for Ferrey cautions!
Sometimes you might be overwriting. Most writers tend to go on adding and adding. It gets only worse then. A genius excels in the art of cutting and cutting, while a novice knows how to go on adding and adding.
And the remedy Give your writing a break. It could be a day at first. Then give it a week. That done, revisit your manuscript after a month. It is a slow process. That is why fiction writing takes so long.
But will this theory apply to other types such as non-fiction and content writing as well
It is a different story. You do not need much time when you are working on writings other than fiction. Other writings require only a few pages. You can revise them conveniently. But what is most important is to know whether you have written too much or not.
Ferrey names it too: overwrought. Although he has ample examples to quote, he would not dare do that. Writers will spot that in other writers, Ferrey notes, but he would not for the fear of making foes among his literary friends.
And that provides us with a clue as to why Sri Lankan English literature does not enjoy a comfortable presence on the global platform. However, there is more to come from Ferrey in his dissection of where we might have erred.
Many of us  me included  want to run before the walk. Take those artists on the pavement by the Art Gallery for instance. Most of those paintings belong to the movement of cubism. Most paintings look exactly like what George Keyt drew. But what we need to remember is that Keyt mastered the traditional painting first, before moving on to cubism. But when we see a cubist or an abstract painting, we feel as if we can do that too.
If painting is writing, then you assume you can indulge in postmodernist, absurd and other contemporary genres. But you need to have your tools  grammar, vocabulary and structure  in order. You need to learn the rules to a professional extent, and then you can break them like an artist.
There is absolutely nothing wrong with experimenting. In fact, it is a good thing to see experiments. But we tend to forget that we should know our craft really well. Thats not our fault though. We have a huge dearth of English teachers. Many newspapers do not have proofreaders. When a child reads a newspaper article full of bad mistakes, they will learn those mistakes.
In an encounter with a foreign head teacher, Ashok Ferrey has come to know the primary difference between the local O-Ls and the foreign A-Ls. The local students enter the examination with a vocabulary of 14000 words while the foreign counterparts are equipped with a vocabulary of 18000 words. The difference has created a huge impact.
And the politicians! They put English in cold storage during the 50s, the 60s and the 70s. Before then we were very much ahead of Singapore and India. Whenever I go to India or Bangalore, it is such a joy to read their newspapers. It does not mean that they are cleverer than us. Their contents are sometimes stupider than that of our newspapers. But it is the style they adopt. They have excellent proofreaders and editors. We suffer from that dearth because English was snatched away from us.
But Ferrey wants us to rest assured for we are slowly recovering. The recovery is most definite because we are a bright nation.
During the creative writing workshops, Ferrey would ask the participants to select five books they really like. Put them before you - he would ask the participants - and think over why you like them. Try to spot the common features. That is the trick of identifying your own voice as a would-be writer.
The voice is essential. Having a story alone will not suffice. You should have a voice to support your style. The voice comes to surface once you go on writing. You should have your story as well as the voice on a fifty-fifty basis. When you read widely, your style will come to you naturally. It will come soon if you are lucky.
We need to read the likes of Charles Dickens and Henry James to understand how verbose they are, Ferrey offers advice. We need to move on to the contemporary writers such as Salman Rushdie to understand his mastery of wordplay. I wont call Rushdie verbose. His is a brilliant wordplay. That wordplay is something that neither Dickens nor James could accomplish.
Among the local wordsmiths, Ferrey is enamoured by Tissa Abeysekara for his simple and poetic style adopted in Bringing Tony Home. It is simply the way that the writer puts the words together. Sometimes I am not satisfied with one adjective, Ashok remarks, and replace it with another.
A writer is a magician. He makes something, which you are well familiar with, disappear and makes something else appear unbeknownst to you. He can make an elephant appear without your knowledge. But then some writers keep on alerting you of an elephant about to appear. When the elephant appears at last, there is nothing to marvel at.
Such writers, Ashok Ferrey warns, are the bad guys.

WE NEED A NEW DISPENSATION
The much required preliminary work to draft a new Constitution has been done. The government should proceed towards the final phase of getting the new Constitution adopted, with the cooperation of all concerned, and as demanded by the people. Ever since the 1978 Constitution was put in place, there has been a cacophony over it. A multitude of voices calling for the dumping of the bahubhoota viyawasthawa and adopting a new one has been there from the time it was enacted and during the lifetime of the presently sitting members of Parliament. It has to be understood, therefore, that the New Constitution should not be a UNPs or SLFPs narrow personality slanted constitution as the 1972 and 1978 Constitutions have been. It should be a people centred constitution as it is the people as a whole who constitute the State and empower the Executive, the Judiciary and the Legislature to act on their behalf.
All the legislators who are made members of a Constitutional Assembly and empowered to adopt a draft of the new Constitution should now proceed to do so without dilly-dallying and procrastinating it under any circumstances. Knowing that they are acting on behalf of the people as well as the future generations who will be bound by the Constitution they should have the inner strength to transcend themselves and so deliberate honestly and with foresight over the draft and adopt a New Constitution that will uphold human dignity and rights and in truth guarantee human freedom, equality, justice, fairness and honour for all people. With these assured, there will be peace in our Land.
Some members of the Constituent Assembly are tempted by their own situation in the present circumstances and are surreptitiously moved to waver from the right and just path. Clearly contradicting themselves, there are those campaigning to retain the present constitution with a few amendments to suit their partisan and personal desires. If however, they are to have their way, the country would be led into another epoch of darkness where the peoples thirst for justice and fairness will be suppressed by force used undemocratically and power exercised by scoundrels, swindlers and deceitful men and women who not only disregard the law, but justify their actions after breaking the law and getting punished.
NO ROOM FOR FOXES
The people have demanded a New Constitution because there is evidently a need for a new dispensation after a prolonged period of political mayhem of dictatorial despots who wished to exercise exclusive power over everything and have the capacity to rob and horde the common wealth of the people, without being answerable to anyone, under the 1978 Constitution. Most disgracefully all the boot-licking politicians passed an 18th Amendment to enhance the powers of a despot and install an uncouth monarchy, in defiance of the will of the people.
The only power these people did not possess was the capacity to look back on their interior selves, examine their conscience and move towards transparent honesty and the integrity of human dignity. The tragedy is that while they are in the depths of ignominy and corruption, they think that all other people are living in a dark labyrinth and are in need of light. Pretending to bring a light they are planning to evade the justice that should surely overtake them. All those who were responsible for abductions, disappearances, murders, well planned road accidents and other heinous crimes of taking ransoms from innocent citizens and every other abuse of power by which the citizens were betrayed, should be brought to justice. No room should be left to restore the reign of political foxes that in their holes devise, plot and plan conspiracies to overthrow a lawful even though still imperfect government, of course constituted not according to their plans.
SINE QUA NON FOR PEACE
In any case, the Constituent Assembly has the onus of presenting a draft of a New Constitution accepted by them to the people to approve at a referendum. Then, it will become a Constitution that surpasses all other constitutions in that the people have participated in the drafting of it and it cannot be summarily dismissed as the product of a partisan adventure.
The New Constitution should assure the liberty, equality and fraternity of the people as the basis of a just society that upholds truth, reconciliation, freedom and bring about a just solution to the national question. This is a sine qua non as a prelude to a lasting peace. No one, including the Head of State should have any space to abuse power and to exercise arbitrary actions, including the use of state resources for ones own private benefit and of nepotism that favours ones own kith and kin and political sidekicks to the disadvantage of all others.
The politicians who know their guilt and whose guilt is known by the people should amend their lives, and not hide behind amending bahubhootha Constitutions for self-preservation; they should restore the public property they have stolen and ask pardon from the people. A former chief justice had asked pardon from the people for an arbitrary verdict he had given in favour of a politician.
He has admitted that he had committed an injustice by the people in whose name he was pronouncing judgement. No reimbursement of the gigantic sum of money involved has taken place. The fraudulence caused to the people persists just like the damage caused by the arbitrary actions of politicians.
It is to be hoped that an acceptable level of accountability is established by the New Constitution. And it is to be hoped that injustice caused to the people by the use of inside information and conflicts of interest will be obviated by the New Constitution. The Constitution should not leave room for anyone to arbitrarily gain, especially huge sums of money, by dishonesty and by rank deceiving of State agencies or deceiving anyone, for that matter.
FURNACE OF JUSTICE
No one should have the power to profit by deceiving the people and taking them on a ride, thus engaging in mass breach of trust. Everyone knows that finding an honest politician may be like finding a needle in a haystack. But with a right magnet, even a needle lost in a haystack could be found.
Therefore with the right values, right attitudes and the determination of the people backed by a good New Constitution, honest politicians, like needles in a haystack, could be found. They should indeed be found, however strenuous the attempt may be, and once they have been found, the haystack of evil doers and corrupt politicians who practice lawlessness should be thrown into the furnace of justice where there will be wailing and gnashing of teeth.
When they are given their just deserts they cannot defiantly hold up manacled hands and grinning teeth and be assured of sumptuous meals in a prison hospital as if they are innocent martyrs subjected to an unjust punishment.

Wild elephants rampage through Ampara villages
Wild elephants rampage through villages in the Ampara district regularly and villagers in the areas complain that they have to stay away from their houses at nights in fear of death in jumbo attacks.
They damage goods at houses and crops on farm land, they complain.
Malkampiddy in the Sammanthurai Divisional Secretariat Division were ruined almost entirely by the wild elephants.
The residents had informed about the issue to the Grama Niladharis and other officials but they have not taken any constructive step to control the invasion.
"Our children cannot engage in their studies in fear of elephants' attack," the residents lamented. They urge the authorities to set up an electric fence to prevent wild elephants from invading the villages.

Further $400 mn from apparel exports in the pipeline
Sri Lanka is not hiding its optimism for its apparels in the post GSP Plus era; especially a further $400 Mn revenues from exports are now in the pipeline for the sector.
We have received the GSP Plus, and apparel exports are projected to increase, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen recently in Colombo.
Business-to-Business exhibitions such as this play an important role since a range of textile products enhanced with the latest technology are made available for Sri Lankan industries. Global manufacturers and suppliers are making them available directly to our Industry in Sri Lanka at this event, he said.
Minister Bathiudeen expressed these sentiments addressing the launch event of the 9th Colombo International Yarn & Fabric Show 2017  Fall Edition along with its concurrent exhibitions International Home Textile Sri Lanka Expo 2017 and 2nd Sri Lanka International Air Freight, Shipping & Logistics Expo 2017, at Sri Lanka Exhibition and Conventions Centre, Colombo.
Minister Bathiudeen was joined by his top officials and Group CEO of CEMS-Global USA & Asia Pacific S. S. Sarwar. This business to business exhibition hosts exhibitors from Taiwan, China, India, Korea, Singapore and Sri Lanka. Promotional and networking events of our apparel industry are therefore now more important than ever since it establishes our brand identity globally. We have regained the GSP Plus that we lost in 2010 and as a result our exports including apparel exports are projected to increase, he said.

NCP principals frustrated over unpaid allowances
The North Western Province Education Ministry did not receive funds to pay the allowances to the principals in the Kurunegala and Puttlam Districts so far although many requests were made to the authorities to release the funds," NWP Education Minister Sandya Kumara Rajapakse said at a meeting yesterday at Nikaweratiya, Kurunegala.
He said provincial school heads complain that National School principals were receiving recently increased allowances but provincial school heads were not paid the allowances yet.
"My Ministry has not received required fund so far. Therefore, I cannot address the reasonable appeals of the provincial school heads. About 1,250 principals in the NWP are frustrated now. Nearly 12,000 school teachers of the Kurunegala and Puttalam Districts must receive salary arrears for nearly two years," the Minister said.
"Steps would be taken immediately to pay allowances with arrears when the funds are released by the Ministry, he said.

Premier Tier B match fixing : Panadura, Kalutara ignored chance to explain - Mathivanan
Sri Lanka Cricket has punished the players and coaches of Panadura Sports Club and Kalutara Physical & Culture Club because over a period of six months given for explanations they evaded the investigation all along, said Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) vice president and District Cricket Development president K. Mathivanan at a press briefing held at SLC headquarters yesterday.
The SLC held investigations after the Premier Tier B match between Panadura SC and Kalutara PCC played at Surrey grounds, Maggona from January 23-25 and both clubs guilty of misconduct and not playing to the spirit of the game.
We dont accept certain statement created by some people regarding this decision, Mathivanan said.
The President of Investigating Committee Asela Rekawa also confirmed the vice presidents statement. Any party has a chance to get judicial action against this decision and can also make an appeal to SLC, said Rekawa.
The Investigating Committee did not decide on the punishment. We have confirmed some misconduct in the game. We only produced the investigation report to the Executive Committee of SLC, he said.
All the players and coaches of from both teams received a one year suspension from all cricket related activities while being imposed a fine of Rs. 500,000 each.
Ports Authority became the top team after the result of the match was declared null and void and they were promoted to play in the top tier of the inter club Premier Cricket tournament the coming season beginning in December. Kalutara PCC has been demoted to third division.
In the related match Kalutara PCC batted initially and scored 390 runs and in reply Panadura scored 180 for 2 wickets at the end of second day. The third and final day of the match Panadura team collected another 243 runs in 23.3 overs to be all out for 423 in the first innings. In the second innings Kalutara PCC made a quick 197 runs in 22.5 overs. The Panadura team chased the target of 165 in 13.4 overs, scoring at a run rate of 12.4 runs an over and won the match to replace Ports Authority at the top of the points table. The skipper of Panadura SC Chamara Silva did not bat in any of the innings reporting sick.
On the final day the two teams produced 607 runs for 23 wickets lost in just 60.4 overs which led to suspicion of the manner in which the match was played.
