MOC did not agree to reverse repurchase agreements
Presidential Commission inquiring into Treasury Bond issue :
The Director of the Domestic Operations Department said the former Central Bank Governor Arjun Mahendran instructed him to immediately stop injecting of liquidity into the market by way of issuing reverse repurchase agreements, to which the Market Operations Committee(MOC) did not agree.
A reverse repurchase agreement is the purchase of securities with the agreement to sell them at a higher price at a specific future date.
On the March 3,2016, Governor Mahendran called me and told me to immediately stop conducting the reverse repo auctions. DOD Director P.W.D.N.R. Rodrigo said.
Reasoning out the decision, he said we have increased the SRR to 7.5% with effect from December 13,2015 and when the SRR is increased with
100 basis points, about Rs.50 billion money comes into the Central Bank, Rodrigo explained.
However, the Market Operations Committee did not agree with this decision because the interest rates may rise high and requested me to speak with Governor Mahendran again,Rodrigo said.
Asked as to how Mahendran responded to the disagreement, Rodrigo explained that, Mahendran told him that it does not matter and instructed to let the Standard Facility interest rates to raise high. I have mentioned all the instructions given by Mahendran in the MOC minutes,he further said.
Asked as to why the MOC disagreed with Mahendrans decision, Rodrigo said the DOD is responsible to maintain the interest rates within the policy rate corridor.
Rodrigo was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
The Commission will commence again on 24,April 2017.

Administration of Matara DCA may change today
It is expected that the administration of the Matara District Cricket Association (MDCA) may change at their Annual General Meeting scheduled at the Sri Lanka Cricket Auditorium at 10am today.
State Minister for Finance and Member of Parliament for the Matara District is tipped to be elected as the President of the MDCA while Dr Sanjaya Sedara Senarath who has held the post for two terms will step
down.
It is learnt that Sunil Mohotti presently a member of SLCs executive committee who has held the post of secretary of the MDCA for over two decades will not stand for election while a group of former cricketers
led by SLCs former district coach Prasanna Galappaththi who opposed the present administration hopes to contest for the key positions.
There has been no spectacular development in the standard of cricket in the Matara District in the past few years due to the tight stringent policies of the District Cricket Association except for conducting the Matara Super League T20 held last year.
MDCAs plans to maintain the Uyanwatta Stadium as an exclusive cricket venue did not materialize due to public outcry.
It is hoped that the first priority of whoever is elected to office at todays AGM will be to better the standard of the game in the District.

Attempt to rob school teacher foiled
Two women from an organized crime group were apprehended by residents in the Battaramulla area, when they attempted to rob Rs 10,000 from the bag of a school teacher travelling on the 174 bus route from Kottawa to Borella. The women were handed over to the Thalangama Police.
On 7 April, Thilini Kalubowila, a teacher of Ananda College, Colombo, had withdrawn Rs 10,000 from a bank in Battaramulla and thereafter got on to a 174 bus headed towards Borella.
A short while later, she had felt someone tugging at her bag. When she looked into what was happening, she noticed that a woman had managed to grab hold of the money in her bag and had jumped off the bus, running away with her cash. She had then shouted at her and proceeded to pursue the woman, but two other women in the same bus had pushed her aside and escaped with the suspect.
The residents of the area and three-wheeler drivers who had gathered around the bus when they heard the woman shouting, had managed to apprehend the female suspects. They were handed over to two officers from the Thalangama Police station who arrived at the scene much later.

Australian assistance to increase women employment in SL
The Australian government, in partnership with the International Finance Corporation, will provide $15 million over the next four years to help local private companies hire female employees as part of its Women in Work Programme.
Concetta Fierravanti-Wells, Australian Minister for International Development and the Pacific, said yesterday at Australia House that the programme will promote inclusive economic growth in Sri Lanka by aiding private sector companies in adopting business practices that empower women.
We will work with companies to demonstrate the business case for investing in women as employees. We will also work to improve their ability to recruit and promote women and men equally.
The programme will also provide increased access to financial and non-financial services for women and women-owned businesses. And it will increase opportunities for women in selective private sector supply chains, Fierravanti-Wells said.
Womens participation in the labor force is just 35.3 percent, and Fierravanti-Wells said that the Women in Work programme would both aid women and benefit the countrys economy as a whole.
Greater female participation in the workforce is now vital to helping economic growth in this country, she said.

CA suspends metal quarry operations in Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve
The Court of Appeal yesterday, issued an Interim Order staying the operation of any Licenses issued by the Geological Survey and Mining Bureau in favour of any person to operate a metal quarry within the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve, until May 4.
The Court of Appeal two-judge-Bench comprising Justice (President) Vijith Malalgoda and Justice S. Thurairajah, made this order pursuant to a writ petition filed by two residents of Dambuluhalmillewa in Kekirawa.
The petitioners had cited Geological Survey and Mining Bureau, Central Environmental Authority, the Conservator General, Department of Wildlife and seven persons who hold licenses to operate metal quarry were cited as respondents in the petition.
The respondants were noticed to appear in Court on next hearing date. The Petitioners through counsel Thishya Weragoda with counsel Iresh Seneviratne and Chinthaka Sugathapala under the instructions of Niluka Dissanayake stated that aggregate extraction activities are continuing in the said Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and amidst the State Counsel specifically informed Court that no such permits have been issued.
The Petitioners further stated that the conduct of the persons in whose favour licenses have been issued clearly disentitles them from operating any aggregate mining operations, within the bounds of Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and the Petitioners verily believe that over 7 quarries are in operation within the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve.
The petitioners state that the illegal activities in the pretext of the purported licenses issued by the first, second and fourth respondents have resulted in causing catastrophic damage to the Hinguruwelpitiya Reserve and an urgent need for intervention from Court to stop such activities has arisen.

Can Antonians turn tables on favourite Royal
Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby:
Royal College Colombo will be at full strength and go as favourites when they take on St. Anthony's
College Kandy in their Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby first round final encounter at the Royal Sports Complex, Reid Avenue at 4.15pm today.
The Reid Avenue boys, one of the strongest contenders this year for the Singer league will be out for their fifth win when they meet the wounded Antonians who lost their way from the beginning of the season.
Royal coached by former Isipathana old boy Sanath Martis, should have things their own way in this encounter.
Fly half Ovin Askey will lead the Royal outfit who will have Nikhil George, Shabith Feroz, Hamza Reeza, Ganindu Dilshan and Lennox Calyanaratne - the key players in the side to pull this game through with a victory. Meanwhile the Antonians coached by old boy Viper Gunaratne will be out for their third win this season to keep their chances alive to move forward and get into round 2 Cup segment when they lock horns with second placed Royal.
St.Anthony's lost two games within close margins to St. Peters (25-27), Isipathana (35-43) and lost to the Joes (11-24) before coming from behind to beat Dharmaraja (34-24) in their last outing.
They will heavily depend on their skipper cum centre Dinuk Amarasinghe, Jehan Seelagama, Kavinda Amarakoon Amare and Samuel Maduwantha in this tense battle to bring an all important win for them.
No doubt that Maduwanthas kicking boot has played a major role in bringing them many victories in this years ongoing league tournament, but we reliably learn this match winner will be unfortunately a doubtful starter for today due to a serious injury occurred against Dharmaraja last week, where he was carried off the field on a stretcher.

Can Masters finally be major win for Westwood, Garcia
Augusta:England's Lee Westwood and Spain's Sergio Garcia, two epic nearly men of golf still seeking their first major title, withstood blustery conditions Thursday to become early title contenders at the Masters.
Westwood, three-over after 12 holes, birdied five in a row starting at the par-5 13th for a two-under par 70 that left him third after 18 holes, five adrift of US leader Charley Hoffman and one back of American William McGirt.
"It was nice to make five birdies in a row," Westwood said. "Really got some momentum going. Got me back in the tournament."
On one of the windiest days ever seen at Augusta National, Garcia shared fourth after firing the lone bogey-free opening round, a 71, with 17 pars and a lone birdie at the par-4 eighth. "I'm happy with it," Garcia said. "Under the conditions we played on, to be able to go bogey free -- I don't know if it's probably my first bogey free round here at Augusta -- it was good to do that.
"I would have loved to have made a couple of those birdie putts I had, but I hit some good putts. And it's very difficult when it's this gusty, too It's hard to figure out the right clubs and you need to get a few breaks."
Major breaks have been few and far between for Garcia and Westwood, European Ryder Cup stalwarts, as they have sought major breakthroughs.
In 75 major starts, 43-year-old Westwood has 18 top-10 finishes and 10 top-4 efforts without a victory. He shared second at last year's Masters, third in 2012 and was the 2010 runner-up at the Masters and British Open.
Westwood, whose most recent win came at the 2015 Indonesian Masters, said he kept his composure after his poor start.
"I wasn't too disappointed," he said. "I was just trying to not make any silly mistakes on 10, 11, 12 and play my way out of the tournament."
Garcia, 37, is in his 74th major this week, with 22 career top-10 showings and eight top-4 finishes without a victory -- a void he dreams of filling by taking a green jacket on Sunday.
"I would love to, yes," Garcia said. "I feel like my game is in pretty good shape. I feel like I'm hitting the ball nicely. Even though today wasn't maybe my best ball striking round, I still hit a lot of good shots.
"I just need to keep working hard on my short game and get more confidence in there and if I can manage to do that, then I should be able to do that (win)."
Garcia, heckled by US fans at last year's Ryder Cup about his lack of a major title, found it easier to keep his cool in front of the appreciative Masters crowd.
"I played fairly well, stayed quite patient and I got a couple decent breaks on a couple holes that helped me salvage par and kept my round going," Garcia said. "But it wasn't easy out there."
Garcia, who last won in February at Dubai, was a 2007 and 2014 British Open runner-up and finished second at the 1999 and 2008 PGA Championships. AFP

Celtics slump as Millsap lifts Hawks
New York: Boston's hopes of pipping Cleveland for top spot in the Eastern Conference suffered a blow on Thursday as the Celtics slumped to defeat against the Atlanta Hawks.
The Celtics, comprehensively beaten by the Cavaliers on Wednesday, slid to another costly defeat as Paul Millsap inspired Atlanta to a 123-116 win at Philips Arena in Georgia.
Millsap scored 26 points and 12 rebounds as Atlanta improved to 40-38, a half-game ahead of the Milwaukee Bucks in the battle for fifth place.
But the defeat put a serious dent in Boston's chances of overhauling the Cavaliers at the top of the table.
The Celtics are now 50-29, lying in second spot behind reigning NBA Finals champions Cleveland who are 51-27 and now primed to lock up first place.
Millsap's points and rebounds total marked a 19th doube-double of the season, and confirmed his successful return from a left knee problem.
Millsap also got backing from Tim Hardaway Jr with 23 points as well as a career-high 20 points from Taurean Prince and 18 from Dennis Schroder.
Boston star Isaiah Thomas led the game scoring with 35 points while Jae Crowder had 24.
Elsewhere Thursday, the Washington Wizards claimed a 106-103 win over the New York Knicks to tie for third spot in the East.
Washington point guard John Wall warned however that the Wizards would need to improve their defense if they were to prosper in the playoffs.
"Our defense is terrible right now," Wall said. "If we think we're going to go to the playoffs with this defense, we'll have an early exit. "We have to figure that out," he added after a win which lifted Washington to 48-31, level with Toronto, who had a rest day on Thursday.
Meanwhile, Nikola Mirotic scored 22 points and Jimmy Butler had 19 points as the Chicago Bulls beat the Philadelphia 76ers 102-90 to boost their playoff prospects.
Butler also produced 10 rebounds and 10 assists for only the fourth triple-double of his career in what was a fifth win in six games for the Bulls.
The Bulls are locked in a neck-and-neck race with Indiana for seventh place in the Eastern Conference, with identical records of 39-40 following the Pacers' win on Thursday. The Miami Heat (38-40) are also in the hunt, just behind Indiana and Chicago.
The Pacers moved to 39-40 after a 104-89 win over the Milwaukee Bucks.
Paul George had 23 points and 10 rebounds to subdue the Bucks, who fell to 40-39.
Indiana coach Nate McMillan said he was encouraged by the grit shown by his team on their road trip.
"We now know exactly what we have to do on this upcoming road trip," McMillan said.
"We were solid on defense tonight, and we did a lot better job attacking. Those are things we have to do. We also did a better job with our spacing tonight."
Bucks coach Jason Kidd bemoaned his team's carelessness in possession.
"We had way too many turnovers," Kidd said.
"We talked about it before the game, that we've got to take care of the ball. If you turn the ball over against Indiana, it puts you in a bad situation defensively, because they are going to take advantage of it, and they did. Once we started turning it over, we were a little hesitant to pass it." AFP

 TheSilk RoadEconomic Belt and the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road, known as Belt and Road Initiative, were proposed by China in 2013 with the aim of building a trade and infrastructure network connecting Asia with Europe and Africa along the ancient trade routes.
 This year marks the 60th anniversary of establishment of diplomatic ties between China and Sri Lanka, and both sides should take this opportunity to further implement consensus reached by the leaders of both countries and jointly advance the China-Sri Lanka strategic cooperative partnership, Yu said.
 The Chinese top political adviser also expressed his hope that the two countries maintain the momentum of frequent exchange of high-level visits, enhance political consensus and boost mutually beneficial cooperation in such fields as ports and logistics among others.
 China is ready to jointly construct the Belt and Road together with Sri Lanka, expedite the talks of bilateral free trade agreement (FTA) and enrich their people-to-people exchanges, Yu said.
 Both sides should strengthen communication and coordination on global and regional issues so as to build an international order safeguarding the interests of the developing countries, he added.
 For his part, Karu appreciated China's support and help to Sri Lanka's socio-economic development, especially in the realms of medicare, education and culture.
 The Sri Lankan Parliament supports the Belt and Road Initiative, and backs the FTA negotiations with China, he said.
 Sri Lanka, which is striving to become a financial and shipping center in the Indian Ocean, is willing to actively participate in building the 21st Century Maritime Silk Road and welcomes more investment from Chinese companies, Karu said.
 On Friday, Yu also met with Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.

Cockerill at helm as crisis-hit Toulon tackle Toulouse
Paris: Richard Cockerill faces a stiff test as he oversees his first match in charge of crisis-hit Toulon against Top 14 arch-rivals Toulouse on Sunday just days after Mike Ford quit as head coach.
Englishman Ford's departure by mutual consent on Tuesday came just six months into the job and after Toulon were beaten by Clermont in the European Champions Cup quarter-finals.
Former France international scrum-half Fabien Galthie has already been announced as Toulon's new coach for next season.
But Ford's assistant Cockerill -- who guided Leicester to three English titles in five years from 2009 to 2013 -- has four matches to seal the Top 14 play-offs and qualify for next year's Champions Cup.
Toulon are fourth on 53 points -- 22 off leaders La Rochelle (75) with Clermont (64) second and Montpellier (56) third. Castres and Pau occupy the final two play-off spots just one point behind Toulon.
Under Ford, Toulon were incapable of winning away but Cockerill will not have that worry with three home games slated against direct rivals Toulouse, Castres and Pau.
Toulouse have had a nightmare season.
Also eliminated from the Champions Cup at the weekend by Munster they are tenth in the Top 14 and look set to miss the play-offs for the first time in four decades. After playing Toulon in Marseille the record 19-time French champions have two home games to come against champions Racing 92 and Bayonne.
Leaders La Rochelle are practically assured of a top two finish to qualify directly for the semi-finals.
But the unheralded westerners face a psychological test as they host Bordeaux who inflicted their last defeat - a 26-0 whipping in November.
Since then La Rochelle are unbeaten in ten straight Top 14 matches, and 13 altogether including the European Challenge Cup where they beat Edinburgh to reach the semi-finals.
"To say that we haven't thought about the away match this week would be to lie," said scrum-half Alexis Bales.
But manager Patrick Collazo played down its importance as they chase a maiden Top 14 title.
"What this match (November) changed Absolutely nothing," said Collazo. "We were on a series of quite interesting results before going to Bordeaux."
Bordeaux are still in the running but need an exploit in one of their three away games against La Rochelle, Brive and Racing 92, and assure a home win against Toulon.
Clermont are also well positioned as they host midtable Brive, with Montpellier holding a comfortable margin before their home game against minnows Grenoble.
Stade Franais, meanwhile, qualified for the European Challenge Cup semi-finals at the weekend, to set up a scheduling headache for their postponed match against Castres after a players strike.
The Parisians travel to Bayonne with Castres hoping to gain maximum points at home against Lyon. AFP

And the woman who has played a key role in helping the Portuguese star reach peak physical condition is Liverpool-born Clayton  who competed at the 2000 Olympics.
The 37-year-old ran in the 200m and 4x100m relay in Sydney and she is now tasked with helping athletes reach their peak in another field. Ronaldo met the former sprinter and nutrition expert through her work with American sports nutrition company Herbalife.
The pair are now working to improve the speed of the Real Madrid star  who has won 29 team and individual gongs during his career.
Clayton is used to being surrounded by elite athletes. She lives with her husband Royce Clayton  the former San Francisco Giants baseball star  in Malibu, California and currently trains sprinters at Pepperdine University.
Ronaldo posted a picture of him training alongside the former Olympic sprinter and captioned it by saying: Working on my speed with the athlete and expert in fitness Samantha Clayton.
The Portuguese and his Real Madrid team-mates travel to Leganes on Wednesday as they look to secure their first La Liga title since 2012.

England all-rounder Moeen Ali jets off to Saudi Arabia
England all-rounder Moeen Ali has made the most of a rare gap between fixtures as he jetted off to Saudi Arabia to visit some historic landmarks.

The Worcestershire off-spinner is gearing up for another domestic season, which gets underway in the coming weeks.
But coming off the back of a successful tour of the West Indies, where England came away with a clean sweep in the 3-0 ODI series win, the 29-year-old took some time to himself before plunging into another English season.
Ali, a practising Muslim, posted pictures on his Instagram as he visited landmarks synonymous with Islam. The Quba mosque, in Medina, is one of the oldest in the world and Ali captioned a photo standing in the foreground: First ever mosque built in Medina. Beautiful place.
Ali also posted a snap in Al-Masjid an-Nabawi, as well standing beneath a sign reading Umar Bin Al-Khattab and captioning it: When you see the name of a true hero.
It has been another packed winter for the left-handed batsman, having toured Bangladesh, India and the West Indies since October.
And their limited overs campaign this summer likely to be just as busy. They have two ODIs against Ireland and a two-match series against South Africa before England host the ICC Champions Trophy in June.
Then England face the South Africans in an eagerly anticipated Test series and Ali is likely to be heavily involved in all three formats as the summer progresses.
But before the elegant stroke-maker worries about any of that, he has the matter of Worcestershire's domestic season to tend to first.
The Division Two side kick off their season with a trip to Cardiff to face Glamorgan in the opening match of the season on April 14.  Daily Mail

Farmers will surround the Agriculture Ministry on April 12, if they do not receive the compensation for their harvest affected by the prolonged drought.
According to The All Island Agrarian Services Confederation Convenor Namal Karunaratne, the farmers have decided to resort to stern action if the government fails to pay the compensation to them as promised.
Today, the farmers are standing in long queues at banks to pawn their valuables to find money to celebrate the New Year, he said.
President of the United Rice Producers Association Mudhith Perera said the people will have to use imported rice to make Kiribath for the New Year for the first time. He further said one of the largest rice producing mills is retaining expired rice.
They mix the local and imported rice and sell it for a higher price and those rice stocks are being sold in many stores today, he said.

FCID to trace Udayangas residential address in UAE
The FCID conducting investigations into the controversial MiG aircraft transaction, informed Court that they have sought the assistance of Interpol to trace the residential address of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga who is currently living in United Arab Emirates (UAE).
The FCID informed Court that they were yet to ascertain Udayangas exact address in the UAE and further said steps have been taken to execute the warrant against Udayanga Weeratunga.
Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne had earlier issued a warrant through Interpol for the arrest
of former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga, a first cousin of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA).
The FCID conducting investigation into MiG aircraft transaction had named Udayanga Weeratunga as a suspect in the case through a B report dated October 11, 2016.
The FCID sought a warrant written in English through the Interpol from the Fort Magistrates Court to arrest former Ambassador to Russia Udayanga Weeratunga over alleged financial fraud that is alleged to have taken place in procuring seven MiG-27 ground attack crafts for the Sri Lanka Air Force (SLFA). The FCID told Court that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs had unable to serve notices on Udayanga Weeratunga who have been residing in Ukraine for several years.
The FCID had informed Court that Udayanga Weeratunga had directly intervened into the questionable transaction in procuring MiG-27 ground attack crafts. The FCID said the deal amounted to US$14 million.
On June 9, 2016 the Colombo Fort Magistrate had issued notices on Udayanga Weeratunga to appear in Court July 15 but he did not turn up.
The FCID had told Court that they were investigating whether the former Sri Lankan Ambassador in Russia had invested money in a company called Sri Lankan Limited Liability Company in Moscow, which were earned through the Mig-27 transaction.
The FCID launched this investigation following a complaint lodged by defence columnist and political writer Iqbal Athas.
In his complaint to the FCID, journalist Iqbal Athas stated that he had written several articles regarding the financial irregularities that had taken place in procuring four Mig-27 aircraft at a higher price. He told the police that these ground attack aircrafts had been manufactured between 1980 and 1983. He said financial irregularities had taken place during the transaction between Sri Lank and Ukraine.

Fielding and fitness levels criteria for selection
With the standard of Sri Lankas fielding being the talking point during the recently concluded series against Bangladesh the brain centre behind the teams fitness and performance have drawn strict lines for selection to the national team.
We have already put some plans for the players when it comes to fielding and we want certain things happening with fitness and fielding, said Sri Lanka team cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha.
Chairman of selectors, trainer and myself we are looking at certain things. We believe if the players are fitter, they will field, bat and bowl better. There was a clear message from the chairman of selectors and myself. We are not going to select players simply because they have scored heavily in domestic cricket. They need to achieve certain standards in fielding. Fitness has to be a certain standard as well, he said.
When you are playing games at higher intensity level, thats where they struggle. When the Provincial tournament finishes, we will start training from May 2. We have to select the Champions Trophy side by April 25. So from May 2 we have time till May 17 before we go and we will have training sessions which are specific with fielding. Next week or so we will finalize our support staff to England and beyond. I have heard about Nic Pothas and we want the best support staff to go to England with us and beyond.
The Sri Lanka players who are participating in the ongoing IPL tournament in India have also been given deadlines to return home and train with the national team prior to their departure to England for the Champions trophy.
We have told the IPL players that they need to be back by a certain day. We are selecting the team by 25 April. The Board told them when they need to get back. They have to train with the team and get ready to go to England. We have given him Malinga permission, said Gurusinha.
Even if a player is not contracted, he is bound to come by the day the board tells him. Even Kumar Sangakkara when he wants to go and play for Surrey, the board has to release him.
"If there is no tour, we give permission to play full series, but otherwise they need to come back. Shakib Al Hasan for example has to return by May 4 as Bangladesh are playing a series. We have told our players to return a little later, he said.

FIFA announces $369 million loss with worse to come
ZURICH, Friday  FIFA on Friday announced a $369 million loss for 2016, a second straight annual deficit, as it recovers from scandals that have rocked world football and acknowledged it had to use hundreds of millions of dollars of its reserves.
The game's world governing body blamed the cost of investigating the scandals, bad investments and accounting changes. But there is worse to come for the organisation, which is rebuilding after its near collapse at the end of the tainted Sepp Blatter era.
It expects to lose $489 million, before tax, in 2017 before a World Cup revenue bonanza in 2018 rescues the accounts.
FIFA's losses for 2015-2017 are set to hit $910 million (855 million euros) even though it revised its 2015 deficit down from $122 million to $52 million.
Revenues fell to $502 million in 2016 from $544 million in 2015.
FIFA said its reserves had fallen from $1.4 billion in 2015 to $1.04 billion in 2016 and they are expected to crash to $605 million this year.
FIFA is banking on making $1.1 billion in profits in 2018 when the World Cup is held in Russia, which would give a surplus of about $100 million for the organisation's four-year accounting cycle.
The organisation said the bumper profits, mainly from television deals, would help bring its reserves back to $1.7 billion in 2018. Since a police raid on a FIFA congress hotel in May 2015 when seven football officials were arrested, Blatter and his two top deputies, secretary general Jerome Valcke and finance officer Markus Kattner, have been suspended or fired.
The three awarded themselves huge bonuses and pay rises during their final years in power and all face criminal investigation. New FIFA president Gianni Infantino took over promising reform but also higher payments to the 200-plus national federations that are now costing FIFA dearly.
Infantino said 2016 was a turning point when the first and vital steps to restore trust in the organisation were taken. This includes a responsible and transparent way of managing revenue and expenditure, he added. FIFA said the main cause of the 2016 loss was new accounting rules. Before they booked profits when contracts were signed, now they can only be counted when the contract, such as the World Cup, is completed. Accounting experts said, however, this change would only account for about $35 million of the 2016 loss.FIFA also spent $50 million on investigating the lingering scandals.
US authorities have charged about 40 individuals and companies over more than $200 million in bribes paid for television and other commercial deals. Many of the defendants, who are to go on trial in New York in November, are former FIFA executive members. AFP

Several the affected were discharged the following day.
Many were transferred to the Ampara General Hospital, the Akkaraipattu Base Hospital and other nearby hospitals for further treatment since Irakkamam Hospital lacks even minimum facilities. The hospital had only 11 beds, Irakkamam Hospital sources said.

Former CB Governor permits DOD to take independent decision
With regard to deciding penalty against PTL:
The former Governor Arjun Mahendran permitted the Domestic Operations Department to take an independent decision with regards to deciding a penalty against Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited, on an Intra-day facility default, DOD Director P.W.D.N.R. Rodrigo said.
DOD Director Rodrigo was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
It was revealed at the Commission recently, that Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) was at a Rs.11.6 billion ILF default on April 1, 2016.
Such a default was not a usual occurrence, Rodrigo said, replying to a question directed by Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake, who was leading evidence for the day.
The PTL requested the DOD to split the defaulted ICIN into two, but we told them we have no room to make such an intervention to the electronic settle system.
So I called the then Governor Mahendran to let him know that there was an institution which had not settled their ILF facility. Rodrigo said. Then he asked me in which bank it was, Rodrigo explained. Then I told Governor Mehendran that it was not a bank who had defaulted, but a primary dealer and to be specific, it was the PTL, Rodrigo further said. Mahendran told me that since I must be aware of the connection he had to the PTL, why dont you take an independent decision and let me know about it as well, Rodrigo told the Commission.
Rodrigo firmly stated that former Governor Mahendran did not give any instructions regarding the matter.
He also said the PTLs offence was taken into the Monetary Board and a direction was issued limiting the PTL to deal with more than one billion in the secondary market.

Geneva thoughts 2017 GHRCR analysis
The 2017 Geneva Human Rights Council Report (GHRCR) contents realization is a serious and also a risky task. Its scrutinization and assimilation have to be done, in the light and the spirit of the script, titled as Geneva Report  favourable or dangerous, published in the Daily News of April 4th, 2017. Not so doing is fraught with misapprehension, misinformation and misrepresentation. The absorption of its right context is not recommended to be achieved, with the rhetoric of religious and political speech oration. Why
There are two types of rhetorics: (1) Religious Rhetoric (2) Political Rhetoric. In Asian countries, the majority are used to be self-based on religious and political rhetorics and root their decision-making in them. For an instance, if a cunning man proclaims: I was meditating in a stony cave of a remote forest and therein, a divine angel called Real gay suddenly appeared, causing a chilling and painful sensation across my spine. He was sent by Lord All Mighty God, to reveal His commandment of chopping the fingers and beheading the heads of the believers other religions- immediately the man will be a messiah and there will be a sufficient crowd to blindly believe and follow the religious rhetoric of this crafty man.
The religious rhetoric deals with God. The political rhetoric is associated with what is called, the capture of power. The reader of the 2017 GHRCR must be dispensed with both above cults and follow the advice of the Buddha, taught in the discourse of Alara Kalama, elucidating, not to blindly believe in what others say on ten grounds. That is the only way to gain the right knowledge of 2017 GHRCR.
Report summery
The 2017 GHRCR is a document, which has assessed the progress, Sri Lanka made, in the implementation of its imposed so-called recommendations, being considered by HRC to be obligations, stemming from resolution 30/1, on the promotion of reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka between October 2015 and January 2017.
It expresses that Sri Lanka had committed to engender a reconciliation and accountability agenda and hence, it has to identify the measure and the depth of Sri Lankan efforts, needed to achieve the progress. The report proposes the Government to exercise a meaningful dialogue with pertinent stakeholders to attain to the targets of transitional justice, the reform agenda and urges the HRC to sustain a more solid investigative involvement and focused monitoring on happening developments.
Contents
The 2017 GHRCR learning cannot be complete unless one knows its full contents. Hence, the writer decided to mention them as below-mentioned: It contains six chapters. Chapter 3 has three paragraphs as A, B, C. Chapter 6 too contains three paras as A, B and C. Chapter 1  Introduction, Chapter 2 - Engagement of the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and United Nations human rights, Chapter 3 - Developments in reconciliation and accountability, Chapter 3 - A. Transitional justice Chapter 3 - B. Reconciliation, Chapter 3 - C. Emblematic cases, Chapter 4 - Preconditions for transitional justice and confidence-building measures, Chapter - 5 Other human rights issues , Chapter 6 - Conclusions and recommendations, Chapter 6 - A. Government of Sri Lanka, Chapter 6 - B. United Nations system, Chapter 6 - C. Member States.
Chapter 1 - introduction
The fundamental objective of the report is to promote the so-called reconciliation, accountability and human rights in Sri Lanka. The 2017 GHRCR urges to read it, not as an isolated document, but in conjunction with documents, mentioned in Part 1, carried in the Daily News. The HRC has precisely rooted itself in the resolution 30/1 and refers to comprehensive recommendations, adopted by consensus as: (a) Judicial and non-judicial measures to advance accountability and reconciliation in Sri Lanka, (b) Strengthening the protection of human rights, (c) Further reinforcement of rule of law, (d) Empirical realization of the commitment of Sri Lanka to international community, (e) Implementation of measures to confront the past, (f) Ending the impunity or exemption from the punishment for the perpetrated so-called crimes, (g) Steps to ascertain justice, (h) Execution of reconciliation achieving agenda, (i) Prevention of violations recurrence. The report also writes about the sources of its obtained information for its preparation: (a) information of the public, (b) Information given by various stakeholders, (c) Information provided by the Government of Sri Lanka. Here, it can well be seen, that, in gathering the required information, no proper and acceptable investigation procedure has been conducted by the HRC. Chapter 1 contains four descriptive clauses.
Chapter 2  OHCHR engagement
The report Chapter 2 begins, describing the empirical involvement of the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights. Simultaneously, it reveals with a mark of appreciation, the cooperation-based engagement of the Government of Sri Lanka, particularly, during official visits, made by High Commissioner, Deputy High Commissioner and other high ranking officers, including the delegation of the Secretary General. Further it explains how the technical support was fostered, expert missions deployed and provided financial support to promote national consultation on transitional justice. The report has laid a special stress on the need to review the counter-terrorism legislation and the system of law in protecting the victims and witnesses.
In its engagement with Sri Lanka, the OHCHR corroborates its commitment, in involving such establishments as United Nations Peace-building Fund, in coordination with the United Nations country team and the Resident Coordinator. While making a mention about its close work with Sri Lanka Human Rights Commission and civil society organisations, the report boasts the collaboration, extended by the Government of Sri Lanka to the UN Human Rights Mechanisms. An important proposal eruption can be discerned from the advice of the Special Rapporteur on the promotion and protection of human rights and fundamental freedoms. That is, while countering the terrorism, he has provided initial comments on the legislation meant to replace the Prevention of Terrorism Act (Descriptive Item 8). Here, the people of Sri Lanka may obtain the clue, from which blue sky, the need to amend the Prevention of Terrorism Act fell down.
A serious note must be made by Sri Lankans, as to the UN Treaty Bodies, which have been mandated to review the progress, made by Sri Lankans, in its so-called obligations, during the period under review: (1) the Committee on the Elimination of Racial Discrimination (see CERD/C/LKA/CO/10-17); (2) the Committee on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of Their Families (see CMW/C/LKA/CO/2); (3) and the Committee against Torture (see CAT/C/LKA/CO/5).
At the end of the Chapter 2, the report welcomes the efforts, made by Sri Lanka to engage with the special procedures and the treaty bodies and encourages the Government, to set out a clear plan of action, to implement the key recommendations made by them.
Community responsibility
The Geneva HRC report is a serious and risky affair. Its impact on the country is immense. Hence, the right knowledge of its contents is a responsibility-imperative for all Sri Lankans and the sloth, torpor, lethargy and the passivity towards it, is not an intelligent option. The first is, to be in ones own self. The problem with the majority community is, they, as a rule, are installed in a self of somebody else. And this other-self installation has found its empirical embodiment, in the psychological inclination to be subservient to political statement cult.
The real domain of peoples dwelling is not their own self, but senseless statements of the psychology of politics, who rob them, harass them and cheat them via dragging them into foolish party bifurcations, stupid religious discriminations and de-socializing cast differentiations, which benefit them nothing. Thus, if the people of Sri Lanka aspire to achieve at least something meaningful, profitable and praiseworthy, the existing political statement cult has to be caused to be ceased and gain the ability to look and realize things and events, for what they truly are.
The blind belief in what the religious priests preach and in what the politicians proclaim must cease forthwith. The intelligence has to explode and the light of right knowledge must dawn. The required lamp, for the light to reach the chambers of intelligence of the people of Sri Lanka, has already been lighted by the present writer above and he is pleased to continue fueling the lamp further for the sake of the safety of this country. Read the text, analyze it, realize same through right understanding and be decisive, resourceful and resolute at the hour of need with deeds.

GMOA plays the politics of nationalization
The issue of higher education is brought into focus with the diversion of the politics of nationalization, and the GMOA doing the SAITM dance that hides the real issues involved. The Government needs to go beyond this dance of the unreal to make a proper impact on higher education.
As I write this the media have reports of the Government Medical Officers' Association (GMOA) confirming its decision to launch a strike throughout the country the next day (April 7). We learn that the doctors who go on strike at government institutions will also stop private practice elsewhere tomorrow, leading to a massive interruption to health services in the country. The stopping of private practice in the period of this strike is an acceptance of the criticism about how government medical officers who are ready to disrupt health service in state institutions, are ready to make money from private practice on the same days. That burden on the public will be heavier as a result of the new decision, but it is a noted recognition of questionable standards that government doctors apply to the stoppage of work.
The right of government doctors to strike is not being questioned. But one issue is whether this is the most suitable time for such action. Dengue is spreading in many parts of the country, and the H1N1 influenza is also spreading fast, with many areas badly affected, although not an epidemic. The University of Peradeniya has closed down due to the flu, and the Kandy Hospital has a special ward to treat the university students; and university students are among the biggest supporters of the GMOA. It is in such a situation that the GMOA has thought it fit to go ahead with its strike, over an issue that does not directly affect the wider public, but is certainly an important issue relating to higher education.
The issue relating to SAITM, that is the slogan of this strike, calling for the nationalization of this institution, seems a peculiar twist of government medical thinking in the country, with a belief that nationalization could solve the major issue of educational standards. It is also significant that the GMOA has not been so widely and loudly opposed to SAITM when it was strongly supported by the previous government, although Mahinda Rajapaksa and the Joint Opposition have changed their thinking on it today. It is also no secret that the GMOA is silent about the poor standards, noticeable lack of facilities for good medical education that prevail in some of the state universities that have medical faculties today. The GMOA is also silent about the poor education and training undergone by those Sri Lankan students who obtain a medical education in many foreign universities, and how they find it difficult to pass the subsequent examination by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) they have to sit to be registered for medical practice.
Medical education
There is obviously a major situation involving the standards of medical education in the country. This is also related to the district quota system under which admissions to the universities are made, with a clearly unfair advantages heaped on students from certain districts, and the unfair situation faced by others. There is no doubt that a large number of GMOA members today must be those who have benefited from this university selection process. What is needed is the total revision of this process, and the introduction of a wholly fair scheme of university entrance, especially for medicine and other fields of science.
Raising the standards of medical education is a national issue and should certainly beyond the SAITM slogan, and the politics with which it is associated today. Those learned in the medical profession, such as the Deans of the Medical Faculties, and at least two well recognized Emeritus Professors of Medicine have made very valuable proposals that must be studied, as well as the recommendations of the SLMC. Rushing to nationalize whole or part of SAITM is not the answer to this question, which will only keep the problem to be resolved at a later date. It can be resolved now, with correct policy making by the government, not being pushed around by even the strongest trade union in the country. Higher Education needs a more purposeful and realistic approach, and away from the cheap slogan of nationalization, as well as the hollow arguments made by the Minister of Higher Education that an order by the Court of Appeal is Law. Parliament is there to pass laws and the courts only interpret them. One must also not forget that the former Minister of High Education did little with the SLMCs previous recommendations on SAITM, and his calls for SAITM support comes with much of political self interest.
The GMOA and SAITM have posed an important issue that affects higher education in the country. Any solution the Government reaches on it, and without delay, must certainly go beyond the political and organisational interest of these two institutions, and think of the larger benefit to the people of this country, who are fast losing all faith in what is most questionably called Free Education today.
Post fast politics
The politics of the JO did take some steps backward with Wimal Weerawansa taking that glass of milk offered by the Sangha to break his second farce of a fast. He remains in Remand Custody, with the Fort Magistrate turning down his plea to be released, due to what was supposed to be his daughters illness and the need to care for her. What stood out at the end of this farce was the clear independence of the judiciary, where the Fort Magistrate made it clear there was insufficient evidence to support his plea for bail.
With all major political parties busy organizing their May Day activities, the JO seems to think they have received a big push to realize Mahinda Rajapaksas pledge to topple the government this year. The JO sees the new promise of success in getting Galle Face Green for its May Day Rally. The JO- Galle Face combine for this May Day has all the signs of a very good political calculation by the UNP leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
There was a time, many decades ago, when the Galle Face Green was the symbol of May Day activity in the country, when the day showed the power of the working people, organised by the left wing political parties, mainly the LSSP. May Day is now much less of a demonstration of working class or workers and peasants strength, but instead a colourful competition among the major political parties, that has pushed the red flag of the workers to a side. With crowd gathering  involving bus transport, lunch packets and spiritual delights, too  being the sign of success in the current May Day activities, the JO will certainly have a great deal to do to make Galle Face their major stepping stone to overthrow the UPFA  UNP government of National Unity. So far it has been boasting of the huge crowds it had at the two rallied held at Nugegoda, in the Rising with Mahinda move before the last General Election, and later in the move to show MRs leadership of the JO. The Nugegoda crowds certainly held up traffic and enabled sections of the media to give the impression of a huge public presence at these events. Nugegoda is a busy town, and an overflowing crowd is not difficult to have at such a place.
Galle Face Green is a much bigger place, with no busy junction, no traffic to be blocked, and a really large land area to cover. It will certainly need all the support that the parties of the JO has  and much more of public support than that too, to make a really big show at the Green. With the new support that MR has received from Sinhala entertainers, and the local government members who are out of office due to the delay in LG polls, it does have some good crowd pulling capability. This will no doubt be supported by the Sinhala nationalist sections that are building a wave of populism in the country.
Galle Face is a real challenge to the JO - possibly with the need to thank the Green Elephant leader Ranil Wickremesinghe, for giving it this chance to show how ready they are to overthrow the Yahapalana Government, even before the two years of the SLFP - UNP agreement comes to an end in August this year. But, the Galle Face draw will also be a threat to the SLFPs, and to a lesser extent the UNPs May Day plans, because of the support that may go to the JO show due to the continuing delay in local government polls.
It looks like the Galle Face Green has returned to a new height among the venues of political expression in the country.

GMOA strike: patients left in the lurch
Emergency operations, Children, Maternity services unaffected :
The usually crowded waiting rooms of the Colombo National Hospital (CNH) were deserted yesterday as the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) and 100 other trade unions launched the 24 hour strike against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
Thousands of patients seeking treatment at Government hospitals were left in the lurch. This comes in the wake of the AHINI outbreak and high Dengue prevalence in the Trincomalee and many other districts.
Patients caught unaware of the strike were turned away destitute and sent to private hospitals in the area.
We came to the hospital at 10 a.m because my grandson is suffering from a very high fever. There is no one here to give us medicine so we are going to Nawaloka, said W. Malani who had come to the National Hospital all the way from Wattala, not aware the doctors were on strike.
Hospital attendants and nurses at the National hospital were assigned to deal with patients and had to either turn patients away or dole out basic assistance.
We are admitting patients but we have no doctors. Many patients know that there was a strike, so we havent had many, but those who were unaware are coming to hospital, said a nurse at the OPD and Ambulatory Care Services of the Colombo National Hospital.
The cardiology Unit of the National Hospital, often packed with patients waiting to be served was empty except for a few who had been asked to come for a check-up that day.
Siththi Nazeera from Maligawatte found out about the strike once she got to hospital and was waiting for over an hour to get another date for her check-up.
I stayed to change the date today otherwise I would have to come again just to get another date. Been waiting for over an hour for the nurse to give me a new date,she said.
The Consultant doctors at the Cardiology Unit took to work in the wards despite the strike and the ICU functioned as normal.
The Daily News was informed that only the emergency operations and services were working.
The waiting area of the Cardiology Unit Dispensary which usually took hours to deal with patients too had slowed down.
Patients who came yesterday and could not get their prescribed medicine have come today. There are no new patients, a dispenser said.
Patients at the National Eye Hospital however have been the most affected as many have had to come to hospital for their scheduled clinic day.
I had my eye operation a month ago. The doctor asked me to come today so he can tell me about the dos and donts of how to treat my eye. I want to ask him if it is finally safe to take a bath, said Fathima Fauzer.
This was my clinic day and we were asked to come today. We were not aware of the strike.
These doctors are simply wasting our time,said P. Kusumawathi who had come to hospital from Bandaragama at 10am yesterday. Two hours later, she was still waiting for someone to check her eye.
We are the ones who always suffer at the end of the day. We cannot stay here all day, we have to get back to our own work. These strikes are only fair by the doctors, not us,she added. Lalitha Chandrawathie from Dehiwela, had her eye operated three weeks ago and had to come to hospital for new spectacles.
I have no choice but to wait, she said despite the fact that the doctors had called for a 24hour strike.
W.M.K. Sirisomage who was returning home to Panadura however saw the demands of the doctors asking for the shutdown of SAITM as being fair.
They have been talking of their demands for some time; it is the governments fault for not providing with an answer.
People would not strike on a whim, he said even though he was returning home without having his eye test done and would have to come to hospital back again next week.
Though the GMOA had asked that their members not report to private practice, private hospitals such as Nawaloka and Asiri Central had no issues with doctors not turning up. The private hospitals, along with the De Soysa Hospital for Women and Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital functioned as normal.

' GMOA TU action could not be condoned'
Due to severe hardships of people and their lives:
Trade Union action by the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA), could not be condoned as as such action could cause severe hardships to the entire society, Secretary General of the Sri Lanka Nidahas Sewaka Sangamaya Leslie Devendra said. How could the trade union action by the GMOA be ethical, he questioned. He said that trade unions should consider ethically of their union action prior to launching, though there was every right for trade unions to go for trade union action.
There are two sides of trade union action, namely Ethical as well as Labour rights, he said. He noted that the government could disperse such trade union actions which cause hardships and threats to people as well as their lives. Under the International Labour Convention, governments are empowered to take measures to disperse such trade union actions on the grounds of protecting the people and also their lives. When people and their lives are under threat owing to trade union action, the government of such country could attempt to come to an agreement with such trade union, he said.

Gurusinha baffled
Sri Lanka teams cricket manager Asanka Gurusinha admitted that he was at a loss for words to describe Sri Lankas vacillating performances against Bangladesh in all three formats of the game that saw the Test, ODI and T20I series all being shared one-all instead of the home team ending up winners.
It comes down to how we play. For me the disappointment was very disappointing nothing to do with the wicket but something wrong somewhere. Very difficult to give answers, said Gurusinha after Sri Lanka had lost the second T20I to Bangladesh at the R Premadasa Stadium on Thursday and thereby drawn the two-match series 1-all.
We should have won all three series. Not good to say that we have drawn all three series as we were playing at home. We were expected to win the series, said Gurusinha.
I guess Bangladesh came here thinking that they can win here. They are a strong side. They have played very good cricket. So have we but in patches. Its disappointing to sit here and concede that we havent done well. End of the day the way they bounced back after the first game. They did well in all three departments of the game, he said.
We played the second and third ODIs well. We played the first T-20 as well but not this one. We need our first six batsmen to fire the top five actually. If we dont get runs there, its going to be a problem. The games we score runs, the top five guys go onto get big scores. We need to bat out 50 overs. If we are to do well in the Champions Trophy, we need to sort out that.
How much did Sri Lanka miss the all-round contribution of injured captain Angelo Mathews on the tour
Angelo is a huge strength for us. But we need to find a way to play without him. He is fit and if we really wanted we could have played him as a batter. But we didnt want to take a chance. We have a decent team without Angelo, but replacing him will be tough. It will be like trying to replace Sanga or Mahela, said Gurusinha.
Malinga for Champions Trophy
Commenting on Lasith Malingas hat-trick, Gurusinha said, I dont think anyone has to explain about Lasith. He has taken so many hat-tricks and he is a legend. His knowledge of cricket is unbelievable. He is a top performer and he performs at his top. He hasnt played lot of cricket in the last 10 to 12 months. Playing T-20s and 50 overs are totally different. We will watch him closely at the IPL. He has got about 15 to 20 games if he plays all the games. The best thing is that he wants to go to England with us for the Champions Trophy. I am hoping he will. We will get an idea as to how well he is going. Fifty-over games mean that he has to bowl ten overs and field 50 overs. Thats where he is a little worried. We are waiting for some good news by end of April.
Its great if Hathu can come back to us
It is a well known fact that Bangladeshs rise as a cricket nation has taken place after Chandika Hathurusingha, the former Sri Lanka cricketer and coach took charge of them three years ago.
I am not surprised at what Hathu has done with Bangladesh. I am happy that a friend and a Sri Lankan has achieved great things, said Gurusinha.
He has been with them for three years and has taken them to new heights. I had got to know Hathu in 1986. The under-19 team when I was captaining I knew his vast cricketing knowledge. We have Graham Ford. He is contracted with us till the 2019 World Cup. Hathu is contracted till 2019 World Cup as well with Bangladesh. If he comes to Sri Lanka one day it will be great for us, he said.

Injured Johnson missed by Masters rivals

Augusta: Top-ranked Dustin Johnson's withdrawing from the Masters on Thursday stunned top rivals who were on the course when he walked out.
Johnson suffered a lower back injury on Wednesday when he slipped and fell down a set of stairs at a rented home. Care and treatment plus some last-minute therapy was not enough to get him fit enough to swing without soreness when he contacted the ball.
That led to Johnson walking off the first tee as his planned playing partners, two-time Masters champion Bubba Watson and 2016 PGA Championship winner Jimmy Walker, started in the day's final group.
"We talked to him," Watson said. "I was on the training table the same time he was on the training table before we hit balls, so I saw him before we went out there.
"You want him to be healthy, you know And so for us we knew if he doesn't play we're going to have a slow day. We're not thinking about him playing or not. We just want him healthy. We want him strong. You don't want to wish that on anybody."
Jordan Spieth, the 2015 Masters champion and a friend of Johnson, watched as Johnson's name was removed from the manually operated Augusta National scoreboards and guessed he had withdrawn.
"Certainly really unfortunate. And as a friend of his and somebody who has played a lot of golf with him, I know this it must really, really not be good in order for him not to tee it up," Spieth said.
"And I certainly wish him well."
Five-time major winner Phil Mickelson, who would become the oldest Masters champion at 46 if he wins a fourth green jacket Sunday, did not learn about Johnson until he was almost done.
"I just found out on 18 green that he didn't start and, gosh, he's been playing some great golf," Mickelson said. "I know it's disappointing."
Australia's Adam Scott, the 2013 Masters champion, was hopeful for a quick return by Johnson, who won his three prior starts to become the Masters favorite with oddsmakers when the week began.
"That's really sad," Scott said of Johnson's withdrawal. "I can't imagine having to do that. It's disappointing, for sure, for everybody.
"The way he has been going, a freak accident, he's obviously very, very injured, because to pull out of the Masters when you're in the kind of form he's in, it must be a very difficult decision to make." AFP

Joint victories and woes
Several Government members have expressed their disappointment that the economic assistance anticipated from Western countries has not materialized. They argue that the Yahapalana has done enough to win special treatment from global powers that stand for democracy. Under very difficult conditions government has attended to the HR proposals and cleaned up the state machinery. In addition, they have shown loyalty to western democracy by rejecting the feelers from the East.
At the beginning, the new government even went to the extent of stopping all Chinese funded economic projects, on the grounds that they were expensive and been negotiated with the former government in a non-transparent manner which gave rise to allegations of corrupt practices. In taking this decisive action the government may have been anticipating compensatory, and cheaper, inflows of resources from Western countries. The memory of JR days; how the UK government funded the lead development project of the 1980s, the Mahaweli river diversion scheme, created such dreams.
Middle income country
However of all the developed countries, it is only Japan that has maintained its economic assistance programme on a large scale for Lanka. Sri Lanka being categorized as a middle income country, much better off than many other countries in Asia, has led them to believe to be more deserving of concession attached Western assistance. The government has now renegotiated most of the existing Chinese projects. There is the possibility of a leap forward in cooperation if the Hambantota port project goes through, though at the political cost of a continued Chinese presence that has deep political implications for Lankas relations with India and other SAARC countries. The government is attempting to balance this out by having Indian investments and also by entering into the Economic and Technology Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India, while also having free trade agreements with China and Pakistan.
New Constitution
On the other hand the Tamil National Alliance (TNA) confirmed that they would guarantee a significant contribution from the Tamil Diaspora in terms of investments in the countrys economy, if the new Constitution solved the Tamil national problem and restored confidence in Lanka. TNA MP, M.A. Sumanthiran made these statements in an interview given to media. Meanwhile, on the question of the sale of national assets, Sumanthiran further noted that it had to be resorted as there was no other conceivable way around addressing the issue of the countrys economy. He indicated that economics is not their issue; as a true liberal bourgeoisie he added that the Hambantota port deal had to take place because of the heavy debt left by the previous regime.
The economy must make a turn-around. It is not an envious position to be in given the state of the economy. We have to come out of this. The sale of State assets is thus necessary. If the new Constitution is made and confidence is restored, the Diaspora will make a significant contribution including investing in the countrys economy. The Diaspora is keen to do so. We guarantee that they will in fact do so. They are only waiting until the aforementioned aspects are done, in relation to the Tamil national problem, he further explained.
While these agreements are spelled out by the Yahapalana camp there is a civil war declared by the GMOA backed by the Mahinda group. GMOA General Secretary Dr. Navin de Soysa said, the government had ignored the concerns raised by the GMOA regarding the existence of SAITM and the fraudulent manner it deceives the public! According to Dr. de Soysa, simultaneous to the strike, the members of the GMOA will keep away from private practice. He pointed out that the GMOA demands include firstly gazetting the minimum standards for medical education in Sri Lanka, secondly, the Health Minister accepting the SLMC Report on SAITM and informing the Higher Education Ministry that the SAITM was not in compliance with the SLMC standards, finally stop recruitments to SAITM and nationalize SAITM.
Political struggle against state
"We have provided timelines to the respective ministers with our demands. However, the government did not respond to our demands. Hence, we had to go for the last resort of taking strike action. It should be noted that it is not only the GMOA that will be engaged in trade union action. The trade union action will halt the entire country," he added. Many other trade unions, including the National Trade Union Centre (NTUC) are also likely to join the strike as it develops. About 150 trade unions and associations have joined hands with them to protest against the SAITM.
Inter University students Federation, National Trade Union Center, Association of Medical Facultys Lectures, All Island Nurses Union and Ceylon Teachers Union were also among the associations which would protest against the SAITM. The joint opposition announced that they would support the Government Medical Officers Associations (GMOA) decision to engage in a country-wide strike. Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena speaking at a media briefing said the government had continuously postponed its decision on the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) despite being held responsible to provide a solution. If all these true, an attempt to over throw the government is inevitable. Marx said continuous general strike is a political struggle against the state.
No wonder why, Mahinda has dreams to come to power in one years time. He is not bragging; if the country is confined to the southern Sinhala petite bourgeoisie, what he predicts may come true! However we have to admit that in the public perception, the government is lethargic in all fronts. President Maithripala Sirisena has tried certain Bonapartist interventions, attempting to overcome this sense of drift by political impulses. He has been having public programmes that enhance his image and improve his local and international network. In the SLFP Youth Convention where he invited UNP leaders too; expressed his intentions of holding the much delayed local government elections this year.
The most important promises made by Yahapalanaya were to remove dictatorial presidency; to eliminate corruption from the governance; finally the improvement of devolution and giving democratic solution to the Tamil national problem. But now there is a widespread public perception that corruption is no longer on the decline, but is now rising with a vengeance, while little or nothing is being done to put a stop to it. In relation to the minority rights presidents interventions have brought negative effects as pointed out by his loyal friend Azath Salley.
The public foolishly expect that a Cabinet reshuffle would reverse this negative trend. The real problem is that main leaders do not come to a common agreement in relation to the burning problems. But it is surprising those Tamil and Muslim leaders, those who played an indispensable role in bringing the government to power, are not yet prepared to leave the internal struggle they conduct within Yahapalanaya. On the other hand the MoU between the UNP and SLFP is only for two years. There is little reason to doubt that the partnership between the two parties will continue. Both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe reject any agreement with the fascistic Mahinda group.
However more seriously, they should look into sabotage activities going on. The Joint Opposition led by former President Mahinda Rajapaksa continuing to hold together, for wrong reasons.
They think fascistic policy could bring them to victory and then they could save all benefits under threat today.
They believe that the popularity of the former president Mahinda Rajapaksa remaining high, the government has no option but to continue to work together as a national unity government to ensure political stability. Hence they expect all who breakaway from the unity government to rally around them in near future!

Man City boss Guardiola needs Hull of a boost
Manchester: Manchester City's season has hit a bump at a bad time, and a victory at home to Hull City on Saturday will help bolster their bid to play Champions League football.
Citys 2-1 defeat at leaders Chelsea on Wednesday means they have now gone more than a month without a Premier League victory.
Successive league draws against Stoke, Liverpool and Arsenal, followed by the result at Stamford Bridge, have seen City manager Pep Guardiolas team slip to fourth place in the standings.
They have also been eliminated from the Champions League by Monaco during that period, meaning that the City managers only realistic hope of ending his first season in England with a trophy lies with the FA Cup.
It has been a less successful campaign than many predicted when Guardiola arrived from Bayern Munich in July with a record of 21 trophies from seven seasons in management.
In the Spaniard's defence, the squad he has taken on at City does not have the spread of world-class talent that he worked with at Barcelona and in Munich, but there have been many signs that the competitive nature of the Premier League has taken him by surprise.
Amid the disappointment of defeat at Stamford Bridge, one significant bonus for Guardiola was the return to action of Vincent Kompany.
The club captain has been struck down by a series of injury setbacks over the last three years, and had not played for more than two months before making his comeback on Wednesday and completing the full 90 minutes. Kompany has had to work hard to convince Guardiola that he is fit enough for a chance, and believes his return should serve as a message to the clubs young players that effort on the training pitch will get you a chance at City.
"It wasnt the easiest game to get back into but what I would say in terms of advice to younger players is: I could have stood back and moaned and complained that I wasnt playing but I never did," Kompany said.
"I worked very hard for that one opportunity and within the conditions that we available to me. I was helpful to the team. Thats what I wanted to do."
Midfielder Fabian Delph was another surprise starter for City, having been in and out of the team this season, suggesting Guardiola is looking at different options as he seeks a strong finish to the league season.
Perhaps his most surprising move in that respect has been the experimenting with winger Jesus Navas as a right-back.
However, that move has shown little sign of working so far, and it seems Guardiola is unlikely to persist with the decision.
Hull climbed out of the bottom three for the first time since October with a 4-2 midweek victory over relegation rivals Middlesbrough.
The Tigers are unbeaten at home since Marco Silva took over as head coach in January, with seven wins out of eight leaving them two points clear of danger to boost their hopes of avoiding an immediate return to the second-tier Championship.
Hull have struggled on their travels, however, with their only away win in the league arriving at Swansea back in August.
"We need to start translating our home form to when we go away because in front of our own fans we are playing well and with a lot of confident," said Silva.
"We have come a long way since I arrived, but I keep stressing to the players that we have achieved nothing yet in our battle to be out of the bottom three at the end of the season."AFP

Michael Carberry hits a ton on return to cricket after cancer treatment
Former England batsman Michael Carberry made a hundred for Hampshire on his maiden first class appearance since being diagnosed with cancer.
The 36-year-old was told he had a cancerous tumour last summer and immediately started treatment, with his last first-class appearance coming on July 8.
Carberry, who made six Test appearances for England, returned to training with his county over the winter, having undergone a successful operation.
He marked his return to the middle in some style, scoring exactly 100 from 121 balls as Hampshire faced Cardiff MCCU at the Rose Bowl.
He was given a standing ovation as he left the field, his knock ending when he found the hands of Matthew Norris off the bowling of David OSullivan.
Carberry has enjoyed an outstanding pre-season, scoring a century in an inter-squad friendly, two fifties on tour and smashed a 41-ball 78 as Hampshire amassed 255 for eight in a T20 win against Durham University. In a statement released last week thanked those who helped him recover and resume his cricket career, Carberry said: I would like to thank my family, the club, the supporters and my team-mates worldwide for all the kind messages of support and love through another very tough time in my career and life. There is still a long way to go to being recovered fully, but the outpouring of support from the cricket family has helped massively in getting me back playing and Im looking forward to another great summer with Hampshire.
In regards to the media, I would like to thank them for respecting my privacy in dealing with my illness and I would like to ask for this to continue on my return.  Daily Mail

Miserable performance by Sri Lanka
Hong Kong thrashed Sri Lanka Men's team by a convincing 31 points (5 tries, 3 conversions) to 05 (1 try) at the world rugby 7s series qualifiers in Hong Kong yesterday after leading 17 points to Nil at Half time.
For the winning Hong Kong team, Benjamin Rimene (two), Max Woodward (two) and Rowan Varty (one) scored the tries while Rimene put over the three conversions.
Speedy winger Anurudda Wilwara scored the solitary try for the Lankan's after covering nearly 75 metres in the final minute of the game. Incidentally Sri Lanka were thrashed by Hong Kong 31 points to nil last month at the Borneo 7s tournament as well.
Earlier in the day Sri Lanka were routed by Chile 38 points to nil in their first game after trailing 12 points to nil at the breather.
Sri Lanka will play Namibia in their last group game today.
Mean while Chile who topped the pool when they beat Namibia 26  14 in their final group game for the day and Hong Kong who are in the same pool beat Namibia 22 points to 07 to be placed second. Namibia ended the day as the third placed team in the same pool and Sri Lanka ended the day with a humiliating last place and it was a terribly disappointing performance by them as they only managed to score just one try against Hong Kong in the whole day after losing both games miserably.

MoU signed between Kelaniya University and ICTISC
To develop ICT related NVQ courses in e-learning:
A memorandum of Understanding (MOU) was signed between the University of Kelaniya and the Information and Communication Technology Industry Skills Council (ICTISC) yesterday, to develop ICT related NVQ courses in e-learning platform in Sri Lanka.
ICTISC Chairperson Poorna Bandara said that one of the main objectives of the Council was to act as quality assurance, coordinating and advisory body for e-learning for vocational education for the Industry Sector councils. Among the other objectives are, providing National Competency Standards and related Curriculums, promoting and obtaining the endorsement from the industry for trainings and courses provided through e-earning platform and providing various industry inputs related to technologies, standards, statistics and recommendations.
The MOU would provide the ICTISC an opportunity to collaborate with the University of Kelaniya in the e-learning project. The Council is basically entering the necessary inputs from the industrial sector. We will be able to get the industry inputs into the university and then create the e-learning resources materials. This opportunity will create a supply chain linking universities, the government and industries, thereby creating an environment for job creation. We need to convert lecture based teaching into learner based teaching. One of the main objectives of the e-learning platform is to introduce leaner based teaching to Sri Lanka. It is essential to provide high quality education. We have the infrastructure which is a e-learning platform. This will be used to train Sri Lankan citizens for the digital future under the e-citizens programme. The entire project is the sustainable and long term programme which would take Sri Lanka into the digital economy.
Vice-Chancellor, University of Kelaniya, Professor D. M. Semasinghe, said one of the main objectives are working with the ICTISC for analysing the needs of ICT related NVQ courses in the e-learning platform and to design, develop and deliver e-learning programmes. Several other
objectives are working with ICTISC to identify courses of other sector council into e-learning platform, creating public and private sector partnerships for professional and career development, promoting anywhere, anytime learning in Sri Lanka and especially, provide knowledge at doorstep for rural areas in Sri Lanka, increasing employability of young people and attracting overseas investors and outsourcing jobs by creating a national knowledge work force.
He said an e-Learning Resource Centre has been set up at the University of Kelaniya for ICT courses as a part of the budget proposal of last year and the government has funded Rs. 250 million for that.
The ICT related NVQ courses are expected to commence at this centre. This would help to produce employees in line with the industry requirements.

No shortage of food items during new year
As the Sinhala and Hindu new year season loomed closer, top Ministers in charge of economy and trade jointly stepped out to the marketplace yesterday, quelled consumer market fears and debunked speculations of any looming shortages. They also promptly re-assured the Lankan consumers of uninterrupted food, commodity and essential supplies during the forthcoming New Year season.
Rice stocks have increased and sufficient stocks are now available in the market for the next two months, said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen at then Pettah market, Colombo yesterday. Bathiudeen was speaking to the press after his inspection tour of retail and wholesale distributors of Colombo wholesale market epicentre at 5th Cross Street, Pettah , joined by Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake.
The unannounced inspections were facilitated by the powerful Essential Food Commodity Importers and Traders Association (EFCITA) on the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the Cabinet Sub-Committee on Cost of Living. EFCITA is the silent giant dominating the essential imports to the local retail market, the 223 strong EFCITA membership across the country handle more than 95 percent of essential commodity imports on its own.
We find that there are more than enough supplies of all essential items, said Minister Bathiudeen and added: Rice stocks have increased and sufficient stocks are now available in the market for the next two months. In fact, rice is sold less than governments MRPs in this open market. Here we found a kilo of Nadu at Rs 68 and white rice at Rs 60 at wholesale prices. We can assure that there will be no shortages. There are attempts by some errant traders and market manipulators to cash in on seasons demand. They are spreading false rumours of shortages, to hike prices during the season. They are errant and legal action will be taken against such violators, if detected.
We are here on the instructions of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe. As you can see, there are no shortages. The stories of shortages are rumours and are spread by unscrupulous elements, said Minister Karunanayake.
Spokesman of EFCITA Hemaka Fernando said that unscrupulous elements are trying to cash in on the season by creating artificial shortages, which is illegal. What Minister Bathiudeen just said is correct-in that there are stocks of all essential items lasting more than two months in the country. Also wholesale prices are much lower. For example, we expect sugar prices to increase as the season gets closer, but this year, sugar prices are falling. A kilo of sugar which was at Rs 103 last week today only sells at Rs 98.
Speaking of the health quality of imported rice, Fernando asked how it could be so and alleged certain elements and some local millers behind this.
Some rice millers have created fear about imported rice saying its harmful which is false. Every grain of rice commercially imported to Sri Lanka is inspected closely by Customs, along with phytosanitary and fumigation certifications. Only imported rice entering our market has such strong certifications. How can such rice be harmful to health
The items identified by the government as essential are chicken meat, red dhall, designated rice types, spratts, chickpeas, green grams, canned fish, white flour, white sugar, full cream milk powder, B onions, potatoes, dried chillies, dried fish, Maldive fish and Sustagen.

Norbies batting was a class above the rest
Some call him Norbie, some others NA and his Air Force colleagues Ever Green. Former St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, Catamarans Sports Club, Adastrians and Air Force and Hotel Intercontinental all-round cricketer Norbert Fernando spoke about his cricket career as he completed 60 years after representing his alma mater in the fourth Battle of the Golds against arch rivals Prince of Wales College in 1957. The former Sebastian captain, Best Outstation Schoolboy Cricketer in 1964 and Bank of Ceylon cricketer Sumithra Fernando has written about Norbert in this years Big Match souvenir.
A very talented cricketer that I have seen in my days of cricket was Norbert Fernando and he has created some batting feats of great skills that one feels convinced that his batting was of a class way above those we know in todays cricket. He produced really exceptional stuff. He had an amazing cleverness, a foxiness, to say to know the ruse the bowler was going to follow next, and so device a maneuver to inflict the harshest damage to the bowler. I saw in a big match how this lion hearted cricketer though injured, came into bat with a runner and produced a very cultured and refined batting piece that chartered a huge Sebastianite total. He was absorbed in to the Air Force soon after leaving school and there too he became a star, and his flowery batting bedecked the cricket there too with all sorts of beautiful performances. He played cricket and very exceptional cricket at that until he retired from service.

Parliament
Condolence message:
Late PM, an exemplary politician who looked down on fraud and corruption:President
Late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake was an exemplary politician who strongly objected to corruption and fraud, said President Maithripala Sirisena in Parliament yesterday.
He made this observation yesterday, joining the Condolence Motion on the demise of late Prime Minister Ratnasiri Wickramanayake, when it was taken for the second day.
He also said that late Wickramanayake was a leftist politician unlike politicians of the new trend who attempt to amass wealth from their initial stage. "Wickramanayake's family had tuskers, elephants, massive lands and shopping malls," President Sirisena said. "But they lost most of their wealth due to politics."
The President also said late Wickramanayake was the Secretary General of the the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) during the period when the late J R Jayewardene led the United National Party. "It was a difficult period for leftist politicians and the SLFP during that period when it was divided into three factions," the President said. "Even the children of the founder of SLFP late S W R D Bandaranaike formulated different parties."
The President also appreciated the late Wickramanayake for his ability to take quick decisions and his eloquence in speech.
Joint Opposition Member Vidura Wickramanayake said that his late father (Ratnasiri Wickramanayake) always believed that the country should be benefited by the acts of politicians rather than himself.
He also said that he was a Sinhalese and a great Buddhist. "But he never was a racist,' Vidura Wickramanayake said. "He stood against terrorism both in the North and South alike. There was much for upcoming politicians to study from him."
The Speaker also joined the condolence motion and ordered that a copy of the motion be sent to the family members of the late Ratnasiri Wickramanayake.
Import of of 257,559 Mt. of rice by SATHOSA causes country a loss of Rs. 15,000 M
A financial loss of Rs 15,000 million had been caused by the import of rice by SATHOSA without Cabinet approval during the last six months from September 2014 to February 2015, said Public Enterprise Committee (COPE) Chairman Sunil Handunnetti in Parliament yesterday.
He also said that the COPE had been informed that the import of 50,000 metric tons of rice was approved by the Cabinet in hauls of 5,000 metric tons at a time.
"But the SATHOSA had imported a haul of 257,559 Mt of rice," said JVP Parliamentarian Handunnetti. "This import had contributed to the breakdown of the agrarian economy of the country," he said.
He made this observation while presenting a report on the import of rice by the SATHOSA from September 2014 to February 2015.
On this occasion, Leader of the House and Highways and Higher Education Minister Lakshman Kiriella questioned if the complain befall on the good governance government to which Handunnetti replied he had clearly stated the time period. "Then you would have to tell us whether it had been committed during the previous regime," Minister Kiriella said. The Minister also moved that the report be printed.

Physician heal thyself
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is at it again. Consultant doctors and over 100 health and other trade unions launched an islandwide strike, halting all health services, in protest against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine, popularly known as SAITM.
This is not the first time that Government doctors resorted to strike action over SAITM. They conducted strikes on a district basis against SAITM sometime back. With the exception of accident services, maternity hospitals, childrens hospitals, the cancer hospital, kidney hospital and dialysis units and places where dengue affected child patients are being treated in the Trincomalee district doctors refrained from working at all other healthcare facilities. Although the GMOA said they would not engage in private practice too for the first time, it was not clear at the time we went to press whether this had indeed been done.
We have written time and again in these columns that doctors employed in the Government sector must not hold poor and innocent patients to ransom to win their demands. This is the view of every newspaper and media outlet in the country, bar none. Although the GMOA says the right to life is more important than the right to education this very slogan is violated by the GMOA by launching strikes.
The GMOA seems to be oblivious to the plight of patients who patronize Government hospitals. It is generally the underprivileged who attend the OPD clinics at State hospitals. Most Middle Class and rich people will anyway opt to visit private sector hospitals, at which GMOA members have no qualms about engaging in private practice.
Thus whenever the Government doctors strike, it is the poor who are most affected. Some patients have to travel a long distance to the hospital in the nearest city or even to Colombo which in itself is a great burden on their purse. They cannot afford to go back empty handed, without any sort of treatment. But the GMOA apparently does not care.
Ironically, in a country where more Middle Class and poor people pay indirect taxes than the rich who avoid income tax, the less privileged classes end up funding medical education. Yes, the doctors strikes affect the very people who have funded their education. People still do respect doctors, but their callous attitude towards the suffering of patients and incessant strikes over SAITM and other issues may erode this trust.
Professional bodies such as the GMOA should not dabble in politics, for private education is essentially a part of the Governments overall education policy for which it has received a mandate from the people. There are purely political trade unions who can voice an opinion on political matters but the GMOA should not stoop to the lowest possible depths to attack the Government on the SAITM issue. The Joint Opposition-JVP-GMOA nexus on SAITM is rather intriguing to say the least. The GMOA would do well to distance itself from the JO and its leaders, who had no hesitation in championing the cause of SAITM when they were in power. Now that they are no longer in power, they try to cling on to any straw to gain political mileage. Many of those who vociferously oppose SAITM now kept mum during the previous regime, fearing reprisals.
The JVP-GMOA mantra of end to free education is so pass, given the large number of private educational institutions that already exist in this country, from international schools to degree awarding institutions. Paradoxically, the GMOA does not seem to oppose the practice of Sri Lankan students going abroad for medical studies. Little is known about the standards of some of these foreign medical colleges, though the GMOA has found fault with SAITM standards.
Those who oppose private higher education conveniently forget another fact  having local private universities will pave the way for a huge saving in foreign exchange. Some degree courses at foreign universities in our own region cost as much as Rs.50 million, whereas a local institution would be able to offer a comparable course for under Rs.10 million. Moreover, local private higher education institutions will be able to offer places to foreign students especially from our region, which will turn them into foreign exchange earners as well.
Sri Lanka risks losing out on the private higher education market, which is now one of the biggest drivers of economic growth in both developed and developing worlds. Countries virtually trample over each other to attract foreign students. India has over 250 private universities while many other countries in the region have at least a handful each. The global higher education market is expected to reach US$ 1.4 trillion by 2020 propelled by rising student enrolment rates, globalization of educational services and the rising demand for an educated workforce in emerging economies. Sri Lanka should strive to secure at least a tiny fraction of this pie, which will be a boon for the economy. The GMOA and others must realise that freedom of education in conjunction with free education will lead to a more prosperous nation.

## Title: Plastics:  Boon or bane

Plastics:  Boon or bane
This seems to be a pertinent question to ask these days, considering the recent news on this matter, saying that the government is seriously thinking of banning certain types of plastic containers.
But can we really live without plastics It has become a day to day utility product which is mainly used for packaging. It is light and convenient and has become a household product that we cannot do without. There is one problem. It being low cost, we tend to dispose of it without giving much consideration to its recyclable qualities. So the waste is one of the biggest problems that the plastic industry faces. The magnitude of the problem is sometimes beyond what we can imagine. A recent investigation done by the writer in the Negombo area showed the frightening proportions in which carelessly dumped plastic waste has clogged the ocean bed in the seas around Negombo. All this is blamed on polythene and plastics coming down the Hamilton canal as well as other water ways to gradually settle on the ocean floor.
Denses Fernando from the Negombo Wallaveediya- Kudapaduwa United Fishermen's Organisation, in a recent interview said that the ocean bed in the Negombo lagoon is covered in a layer of polythene. He says that on an average one square meter of the sea bed holds 15 kilos of polythene and plastic and that various canals and waterways flowing to the deeper ocean are blocked by polythene, which has changed the marine environment of the harbour. The clogging of the lagoon and sea bed is what prevents the breeding of sea creatures, resulting in the drop of their catch. Diverted drains running across town, overflowing polythene and other waste into the ocean is another issue they face.
Denses Fernando of the Negombo Wallaveediya - Kudapaduwa United Fishermen's Organisation
These fishermen say that the cleaning operations undertaken by the different government departments have not helped the lagoon or the harbour area a great deal, because only the surrounding area and the shallow waters get treated. The plastic clogging occurs on the ocean floor and that area remains untouched.
Another fisherman, Maximan Koogne also from the Negombo Wallaveediya- Kudapaduwa United Fishermen's Organisation, said the problem lay not in the use of plastics but in the way in which it was used. He says that most low income families, who live in proximity to the harbour, collect empty bottles made of polyethylene terephthalate (PET) lying on the Negombo beach for recycling as recycled plastic is used to generate electricity. The people are compliant, especially since they get paid for doing this, says Koogne, adding that they themselves should go for such an arrangement i.e. to recycle.
According to Stanley Peiris, Secretary of the Madhal Owners Cooperative Society said when they drag their Madhal nets in, most of what comes is plastic and other waste material, because the ocean floor is thickly clogged with it.
Taking these statements into account, it becomes clear that a proper solution is needed to prevent the dumping. There is no doubt that this has become a menace. Something needs to be done about it. The easiest would be to stop using certain plastic as a packaging material like the recent suggestion to ban certain types of plastic packaging like PET bottles; but that is not a solution. Nor is glass the alternative, since glass is more environmentally unfriendly in production as well as transportation. In fact, research done by Dr. Vijay G. Habbu, who has a PhD. in Polymers and Fiber science, says that the use of PET in packaging consumes 52 percent lower energy compared to glass or metal, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 55 percent.
PET is an environmental friendly substance that is easily recyclable. All PET containers can be collected, sorted and recycled. Due to the robustness of the material, they can be recycled into textile products or even back into bottles after melting and re-extrusion or re-molding. The World Health Organisation (WHO), in the report as of April 2015 From Farm to Plate, make food safe stated that PET is a safe, strong packaging material which can be recycled easily. Thus, PET gets picked up preferentially from the garbage due to its lucrative returns in the recycling business. For example, the global average is 55 percent, whereas in neighboring India, more than 70 percent of PET gets recycled. It is also preferred by the waste collectors due to its light weight, high remuneration and safe handling compared to other substances like glass which is fragile and harmful says Vijay G. Habbu, who works as an expert in the industry.
There is a crying need for a solution to handle plastic waste. Primarily, it is a matter of education and secondarily and most importantly, it is the collection and processing for recycling. In tackling this problem, we need to engage with the social aspects of it and make the people understand the massive environmental harm it causes as a waste product. This could primarily be woven into the Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) programmes of the corporate sector, particularly, the manufacturers of plastics and the companies that use it for packaging. It would also be a great opportunity for NGOs to partner the corporate sector to help government authorities to bring some sense and order to the whole system.
We need a solution soon for plastic packaging. A rational approach to the problem is necessary or else it would be a case of throwing the baby out with the bath water.

Ranatungas compliment is very encouraging  Shakib
Bangladeshs leading all-rounder and former Shakib Al Hasan has described the recently concluded tour of Sri Lanka as one of the best because it was played overseas.
To do well in Sri Lanka is rare. We drew in all three formats, which is a big thing for us. It is one of our best series, since this is an away tour, said Shakib who was named Man of the Match at the end of the second T20I played at the R Premadasa Stadium on Thursday which Bangladesh won by 45 runs.
We played with more freedom in the second T20, compared to the first game. I think it is a positive sign. We have to play like this in T20s. We made huge improvements in the Test series, after losing the first game.
In ODIs, we showed the consistency of the last couple of years. We didnt bat well in the third ODI, but overall we had a mindset change in Tests and T20s. We dont often win like this abroad, he said.
The win was important because we hadnt won the last eight games. The Asia Cup was our last good tournament. It was a big challenge for us in this game, after losing the first game. This is a satisfying win.
Shakib played a pivotal role in Bangladeshs victory top scoring with a fluent 38 off 31 balls and capturing three crucial wickets for 24 runs with his left-arm spin.
Contributing for the team is always satisfying. Winning gives you confidence. My job is to contribute with ball and bat, said Shakib. I try my best in all games. Sometimes it happens, sometimes it doesnt; how much effort I am putting in the ground that is important for me, and thats what I am doing for the last few months.
Thursdays win was special for Bangladesh as it gave them an opportunity to give a memorable send-off to their captain Mashrafe Mortaza who quit from T20 cricket.
It was important to send off Mashrafe with a win, but what was more important was to represent Bangladesh. I think what you saw out there was an expression of that pride, said Shakib.
Mash is a special figure in the dressing room. Naturally everyone will miss him. We need support on and off the field, and theres no one more helpful than him. Nobody can play forever, so I wish him all the very best in life. I would want him to continue in the ODI team for a long time, and take Bangladesh cricket forward, he said.
Bangladeshs rise especially in ODI cricket has them thinking on the lines of winning the next World Cup in England in 2019. Sri Lankas World Cup winning captain Arjuna Ranatunga has predicted that Bangladesh would win it in 2023 when it is held in the subcontinent.
I think we have a very good chance in 2019 as well, said Shakib. The way we are improving, if we keep it up, I think we will have a very good chance. We lost to India in the 2015 World Cup. They played better than us in that game. Overall, if you look at our graph, we are doing well.
We have some experienced and young players, who are performing really well. We are going in the right direction. I would fancy our team would do well in the 2019 World Cup. Arjunas comment is a great compliment for us. It will always encourage us to do well.

Revision bail application by Anura Senanayaka fixed for June 2
The Colombo High Court yesterday fixed for June 2 to consider the bail revision application filed by Western Province former Senior DIG Anura Senanayake arrested and remanded over his alleged role in the cover up of evidence in the former rugby player Wasim Thajudeen murder.
However, Deputy Solicitor General Dilan Ratnayake raised objections to release the suspect on bail at this juncture citing that police were yet to conclude investigations into the incident.
Through this revision application, former DIG sought an order against the Colombo Additional Magistrates refusal to enlarge him on bail and argued that there is no justifiable reason to do so.
The petitioner said that the Colombo Additional Magistrate had refused to release him on bail on a number of occasions since he had been charged for conspiring to commit a murder. The petitioner said there is no evidence to prove that he was involved in conspiring to commit a murder and thereby moved Court that he be released on bail.
The prosecution maintained that there is a suspicion that the suspect had been involved along with the main suspects to commit this murder since the circumstantial evidence has suggested that the suspects had done their investigations to record Thajudeens death as a fatal road accident.

Should a slave-era song be used as a sports chant
A slap in the face of history:
I looked over Jordan, what do I see, Coming for to carry me home. A band of angels coming after me, Coming for to carry me home.
It is one of the most recognized African-American spirituals. Revered, emotive, and rooted in the horrors of US slavery and the oppression of race.
Chris Oti was the first black player to play for England in 80 years.
But for the last three decades, the familiar melody of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot has also been the adopted anthem of Englands rugby union team, its haunting chorus a common echo in stadiums where the national team plays. And therein lies the problem
Is it right that a slave-era song -- one which is believed to be a coded message for those slaves seeking the underground railroad to freedom -- is used to galvanize a national team to sporting glory Should lyrics which are about suffering and despair be sung by thousands of England fans who are often middle-class, often white
A slap in the face to the history of slavery, is how Cornell William Brooks, president of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), described the use of this spiritual in a sporting arena. Lord Herman Ouseley, a British Member of Parliament and chairman of anti-racism group Kick it Out, said singing Swing Low, Sweet Chariot to cheer a rugby team was a matter of ignorance, lack of sensitivity and arrogance.
American academics have called it cultural appropriation, but many England rugby union fans are unaware of the origins of a tune they now call their own and believe it now serves a different function.
Historically insulting and disturbing
Brooks, a lawyer and an activist, admitted he was not aware of how Swing Low, Sweet Chariot was being used on the other side of the Atlantic until the issue was raised by American media during this years Six Nations.
Despite this not being the first instance of music or art originating in one historical context but used in another, Brooks said singing Sweet Low, Sweet Chariot in the stands was no less disconcerting.
As the CEO of NAACP and a fourth generation minister in the Methodist church, its difficult to overlook the degree to which these songs are being ripped out of their history, he told CNN Sport.
Can you imagine people whose lives, bodies and beings were being sold as commodities singing about freedom, their longing for freedom, their longing for a God to free them, and have those same songs being sung in celebration of a victory on a rugby field Its just odd and historically insulting.
Rugby, as with any sport, has a certain universal appeal and everyone -- all the fans -- should be comfortable and enjoy the experience. Listening to a song about slavery on a rugby field is just an insulting and disturbing experience.
As an African American and descendant of slaves, it would be very hard for me to listen to a spiritual being sung on a rugby field. Thats not something I could do and a great many people aware of their history would find it very disturbing.
Ignorance and arrogance
Professor Louis Moore, associate professor of history at Michigans Grand Valley State University, said he was shocked, but not surprised, to learn of a solemn spiritual being used at Twickenham, the home of English rugby union.
At best its just a bad mistake, at worst its a continuation of global imperialism in sport, he told CNN Sport.
Its about appropriation, power and not caring about history. Youd hope they find another national song.
Social media threats
Lord Ouseley described the abuse he has been subjected to on social media when addressing such issues as tiresome and threatening.
The moment someone, like myself, suggests that the authorities try to read knowledge and sensitivity, you can expect a reaction claiming that you want them to ban them from singing their theme for no other reason that political correctness, whatever that is, followed by a barrage of endless social media abuse, said the 72-year-old Guyana-born parliamentarian.
The reality is that most black British people have bigger issues to confront in the context of inequalities and exclusion and have therefore become apathetic towards challenging racially offensive chanting. Those small number of black followers who go to Twickenham are almost themselves ignorant about the history of this solemn spiritual and its origin.
They are happy to blend in with the crowd and pleased to feel accepted by not showing objection to any intended or unintended disrespect and abuse. I cannot imagine attendees at a Black Power meeting wasting their time signing Rule Britannia even satirically knowing that the symbolism of such themes are about the painful experiences of slavery, oppression, exclusion and racism.
It should be sung with gusto
On learning of the songs origins, Tony Crawford, 60, from Birmingham believed Swing Low, Sweet Chariot should still be sung with gusto at Twickenham regardless.
Its tradition, he told CNN Sport before his teams Six Nations clash with Scotland. Its a great song.
Another England fan, Casey Boyd, from London, believed the context had changed.
What it represents now is not the same thing it represented back then and this is more about a song thats being sung to build team spirit, she said. Brooks said the England team itself had the power to stop the song being used as a rugby union anthem.
Whether or not there will be legislative, legal jurisdiction is one thing, but the ability of the team themselves to do something about that is pretty much unquestioned, he said.
When asked whether the Rugby Football Union (RFU) -- English rugbys governing body -- would be reviewing the use of Swing Low, Sweet Chariot, an RFU spokesperson said: Swing Low has been associated with rugby and rugby clubs for decades.
It is sung by fans to get behind the England rugby team.
England fans first sang Swing Low, Sweet Chariot on March 19, 1988, to celebrate the teams victory over Ireland.
Why that song Why then British newspapers have pinned its origins to the performance of Chris Oti, the scorer of a hat-trick in that victory over the Irish and the first black man to play for England in 80 years. James Peters had been the first black player to represent England in 1906.
A group of students, so the story goes, burst into song in recognition of Otis display that day and since then it has taken on a life of its own. For Brooks, there is no mitigation.
In respect to the song being sung for a black player does not make it any less offensive to black people, that does not mitigate the insult and injury at all, he said.
The fact that this may have been some kind of personal celebration does not in any way speak that it is politically insulting.
Professor Moore added: Things change, the meaning of words change. But its whos changing the meaning. Thats the real problem here.
Apparently itd been nearly a 100 years since that team had a black player, which is striking. That says a lot about that sport, about the opportunity to play it.
Before his teams Six Nations match against Scotland on March 11, New Zealand-born England captain Dylan Hartley defended the use of the song to galvanize the team.
I dont know the history, he told reporters. To me Swing Low is the England rugby song. Ive knew it like that as a kid, growing up in New Zealand. Should I know the history
To us its the noise, the sheer atmosphere it generates and the feelgood factor it gives Twickenham. - CNN

Son Zions 16th birthday bash
Floyd Mayweather buys a 31,000 Mercedes C-Class Coupe:
Floyd Mayweather continues to live up to his nickname Money.
The former five-weight world champion is renowned for splashing out on private jets and placing million-dollar bets.
Floyd Mayweather and Zion pose in front of the Mercedes car his son received as a present
And Mayweather has now treated his son, Zion, on his 16th birthday to a Mercedes C-Class Coupe worth around 31,000.
Mayweather claims to have made more than 640million during a 19-year-career in which he beat some of the best fighters of his generation.
And it is not the first time the 40-year-old has bought such extravagant gifts for his children.
Last year he bought his other son Koraun a 30,000 Mercedes for his 16th birthday, a year after treating him to a Bentley golf cart for his 15th birthday.
Mayweather presented Zion the gift at a 16th birthday bash at which Young Thug performed for him and dozens of friends.
The 40-year-old was in Los Angeles on Sunday night to watch the LA Lakers take on the Memphis Grizzlies at the Staples Center alongside David Beckham.
Money has not fought since he beat Andre Berto and stretched his perfect professional record to 49-0 in September 2015.
But talk of a cross-over fight with UFC star Conor McGregor has been rumbling on for months and last month, Mayweather officially came out of retirement to fight the Irishman.  Daily Mail

Sri Lanka Police too good for Malaysian counterparts
For the first time in Kandy two Police teams were seen in action at rugby between Sri Lanka Police and Royal Malaysian Police. Playing a good game of run and pass rugby Sri Lanka Police did well to defeat Royal Malaysian Police by 51 points (5 goals, 2 tries and 2 penalties) to 3 (1 penalty) at Nittawela grounds yesterday. Sri Lanka Police dominated play in the first half and led 25-3.
Sri Lanka Police played a better game, their forwards combined well and they made every effort to see that their threes moved the ball. The halves combination worked well and gave the ball plenty of air. Both packs shared the scrums and the line outs and Sri Lanka police were good in their loose play. The Malaysian halves did not combine and the threes could not get going as they fumbled or delayed the passes. The local fullbacks impressed with his long kicks to touch.
For the winners Kasun Rajakaruna scored two tries and there was one each from Hashan Gomez, Iroshan Silva, Upala Edirisinghe, Danushka Edirisooriya and Udaya Sanjula. Sandesh Jayawickrema goaled three tries and two penalites and Priyankara Jayaratne goaled two tries. For the losers it was Faizal Zulfiki who put over the penalty.
The Malaysian Police team and the officials were seen at the Meeramacam Jumma Mosque at Friday prayers yesterday.
Before the game the two teams were introduced to Royal Malaysian Police IGP Tan Sri Dato Sri Khalid Bin Abu Bakar and the guest of honor was DIG Kandy Division Lalith Jayasinghe.
The second leg is on Sunday at Police Park. The winners will be presented the IPG trophy on the aggregate of points of the two games.

Tehran's first marathon: no women allowed
TEHRAN, Friday  Hundreds of runners took part in Tehran's first-ever marathon on Friday, but many women were outraged to find they could only run a short distance in a closed-off stadium.
While men ran through Iran's capital in the morning, women were allowed to run just 10 kilometres (six miles) in Azadi stadium in the afternoon -- with no male spectators or officials permitted.
Many were baffled by the move, since there are no rules against men and women running together in Iran -- and joggers of both sexes are often seen in parks and public areas.
I registered but I quit. I took back my 500,000 rials ($15) because we were deceived, Nasim, an architect in her 30s, told AFP.
When they separate us, it is like they are casting us aside. They are insulting us. Everywhere in the world, marathons are held on public streets -- not in a closed space, she said. Sports Minister Massoud Solanifar denied claims that the separation of sexes was imposed at the last minute.
From the start, there was no chance the competition would be mixed, he told Iranian media.
Professional sporting events are strictly segregated in Iran. Women are not even allowed into sports stadiums to watch football -- although they were allowed to watch Friday's marathon.
I didn't know the run would be segregated and if had, I think I would not have signed up, said Hedieh Madani, a 28-year-old teacher.
The way the women's section was organised is very offensive. I usually run with my friend outdoors. It's really nothing special. If you go to parks, you see men and women running. Several dozen foreigners took part in the marathon, from around 40 different countries. I'm very disappointed that I can't do the full distance because I trained for it, but my husband is running so I will cheer him on, said Cecile Maceron, a French runner who had travelled to Iran specifically for the event. The organisers had said around 30 Americans would run, but only one Iranian-American showed up. Among the men, at least, the event was well-received.
I have just run my first marathon and it was great. The route was good, there were quite a lot of people cheering us on. For a first marathon, it was a big success, said Thomas, a 22-year-old French lawyer who has lived in the city since January. Only amateurs took part in the inaugural event, but the organisers say they hope to attract professional runners in the coming years. AFP

## Title: Trump, Xi at Mar-a-Lago for high-stakes summit

Trump, Xi at Mar-a-Lago for high-stakes summit
US: President Donald Trump greeted Xi Jinping to his Florida resort of Mar-a-Lago with a smile and a handshake Thursday, as cordiality replaced tough anti-China rhetoric during a first face-to-face encounter. Trump, in his signature red power tie, welcomed his Chinese counterpart Xi, decked out in contrasting blue, to what the US leader likes to call the "Winter White House" for a superpower summit in the sun.
This is the first time the two leaders meet, after a US election that featured frequent barbs at China's "rape" of the US economy.
Trump had also ridiculed his predecessor's decision to offer Xi a coveted state dinner, saying that -- if elected -- he would serve the 63-year-old a Big Mac.
But inside Mar-a-Lago's ornate dining room -- with gold-trimmed chairs, fine cut glass and polished silverware -- there was little indication that McDonald's will be on the menu later Thursday.
President Donald Trump's daughter Ivanka Trump and three children Arabella, Joseph and Theodore arrive in Florida for the summit. 
The open agenda and the personal setting for the 24-hour summit are designed to allow the leaders to freewheel and build a rapport, in what is the world's most important relationship.
Amid concerns about security and public perceptions, Xi and his wife are not staying at Mar-a-Lago, but at a resort and spa a short drive down the palm-fringed coast that is, for now, watched by snipers, tactical units and a coastguard cutter.
But Matt Pottinger, the top White House Asia expert who was tasked with planning the summit, promised a "relaxed interaction" despite a backdrop of tensions over trade and North Korea.
The two leaders will be joined Thursday evening by US First Lady and former model Melania Trump and Peng Liyuan -- a celebrated folk singer who was once more famous than her husband.
The group will "have an opportunity to have tea together, meet some of their senior cabinet officials, so to speak, on both sides, and have a dinner," Pottinger added.
Talks will continue up to a working lunch on Friday, that are likely to turn to more serious issues.
The summit has been somewhat overshadowed by renewed missile tests in North Korea and an apparent chemical attack in Syria that could prompt US military action.
The UN Security Council -- where both China and the United States hold a veto -- is expected to meet later to discuss a response to Bashar al-Assad's Syrian regime.
No one -- neither diplomats nor aides -- could be sure what would happen when the most powerful Chinese leader in a generation met a mercurial American president who has been in office less than 100 days and is capable of unraveling the most carefully-laid plans with a single 140-character tweet.
For that reason Xi arrived with a gift-basket of "tweetable deliverables", sources say, peace offerings on Trump's signature issues -- trade and jobs -- that he hopes will smooth over a relationship that began on shaky ground following disagreements over Taiwan.
Top of the list, according to a source briefed on Xi's plans, will be a package of Chinese investments aimed at creating more than 700,000 American jobs -- the number pledged to Trump by China's regional rival Japan, during Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's February Mar-a-Lago visit.
There may also be offers to further open China's auto and agricultural markets, insiders say, and even some concessions on Chinese banks' transactions with North Korea, a vital financial lifeline for the country.
In return, Xi hopes to get assurances from Trump on punitive tariffs and that an American arms sale to Taiwan will be delayed, at least until after a major Communist Party meeting later this year.
Trump's position on democratically-ruled Taiwan, which China considers a breakaway province, has been a major irritant since the billionaire politician accepted a protocol-breaking phone call from the Taiwanese president after his election victory.
The summit stakes, both domestic and international, are high.
Disagreements over approaches to North Korea or bilateral trade could, if mishandled, destabilize North East Asia or tank the global economy.
On the domestic political front, Xi is heading into a critical year. Ahead of a party congress that could cement his grip on power for years to come, he needs to show that he can deal with the US leader as an equal.
He "cannot afford to lose face while China aspires to be the new center of gravity for the world order," China political analyst Willy Lam told AFP.
Meanwhile, Trump -- who is reeling from legislative defeats, low approval ratings and unrelenting scandals -- desperately needs a win.
On the US side, however, North Korea will likely top the agenda following Wednesday's provocative missile launch.
The Trump White House worries Pyongyang is just months away from marrying nuclear and long-range missile technology and putting the west coast of the United States within striking distance.
While Beijing has condemned the missile tests, it has hesitated to take dramatic action against Pyongyang, fearing that the country's collapse would generate a flood of refugees across its borders and leave the US military on its doorstep. - AFP

UNODC Regional Representative presents credentials to FM
Regional Representative for South Asia, of the United Nations Organisation on Drugs and Crime (UNODC), Sergey Kapinos, presented credentials to the Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera, at the Foreign Affairs Ministry yesterday.
Foreign Minister Samaraweera noted that given the strategic location of Sri Lanka in the Indian Ocean, Sri Lanka is vulnerable to be utilised as a transit point for drug trafficking. He commended the Southern Route Partnership initiative undertaken by the UNODC to counter heroin trafficking in the Indian Ocean which will be helpful for Sri Lankan drug enforcement authorities.
Minister Samaraweera reiterated the necessity to enhance drug trafficking tracing methods with the use of latest scientific technology and praised the contribution made by the UNODC for undertaking capacity building measures to support the drug/law enforcement and drug demand reduction initiatives carried out in Sri Lanka.
UNODC representative Kapinos noted that Sri Lanka is one of the countries open for cooperation and therefore would work closely with the Sri Lankan authorities to counter drug trafficking activities.

Wimal Weerawansa was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.50,000 with two sureties of Rs.500,000 by Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne.
The Magistrate further issued an order directing the Controller of the Immigration and Emigration preventing MP Weerawansa from leaving the country and his passport was ordered to be surrender in Courts.
While deciding to release the suspect on bail, the Magistrate observed that the mental health condition of the suspects the15-year-old daughter can be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release the suspect on bail after perusing the medical documents submitted in Court. The Court was informed that MP Weerawansas daughter was suffering from symptoms of
adjustment disorder owing to separation from her father for a three-month-period. However, the Magistrate rejected the claims by defence that the suspect cannot be charged under Public Property Act for aiding and abetting to commit offence.
She further observed that the remand period of the suspect cannot be considered as an exceptional circumstance to release the suspect on bail. Wimal Weerawansa had been charged under the Public Property Act, Prevention of Money Laundering Act and Penal Code and was arrested by FCID on January 10. On January 24, the Magistrate refused to enlarge the former Minister on bail observing that the evidence presented before Court have proved that former Minister Weerawansa had intentionally given these vehicles to his close relatives and his party activists while they were not holding any position at the SEC.

However, the vehicles in question had been given to five relatives of the former minister including his sister. Ten other vehicles were given to 10 officials of the Jathika Nidahas Peramuna and the other vehicles were given to his staff members who were not entitled to receive them, the FCID had told Court.
The FCID alleged that Weerawansa had given these vehicles for the use of his close relatives and private staff members without Treasury approval during 2010 to 2015.
However, the defence had denied the allegations and informed Court that the FCID is conducting a politically motivated inquiry to punish the governments political opponents.
The FCID had filed a B report in Court againstWeerawansa alleging that he misused 40 vehicles while functioning as the Housing, Construction and Engineering Services Minister incurring a loss of Rs. 91 million to the state.

Workers should enjoy GSP Plus benefits: Devendra
The benefits of GSP Plus should come to employees than employers once the country receives the GSP Plus concessions in future, Industrial Sri Lanka Council (ISLC) Chairman Leslie Devendra said.
He added that the benefit of GSP Plus may be held back by employers without giving those perks to employees.
Therefore, the ISLC has informed the European Union to look into the matter and ascertain whether employees will receive the benefit of the GSP Plus. Moreover, the EU was made aware by the ISLC to consider the measures taken towards strengthen labour rights in the country. As a result of the awareness, an EU fact finding team relating to labour rights will visit the country on Monday (10), Devendra said.
The seven member EU delegation, which comprises EU Parliamentarians and union members of the labour rights relations, will meet the President, the Prime Minister,Labour Minister union leaders, employers federations and few more. The EU delegation will stay in the country for three days.
He added that labour rights are badly suspended and violated especially in the garment sector in the country. Workers in the garment factories are commonly and badly exploited. It has been reported that government workers are working for a meager salary under minimal facilities and with suppressed labour rights. Then the ISLC will stand for the garment workers aiming to protect their labour rights. We strongly urged the employers not to exploit the GSP Plus benefit once the country receives it, he said. He added that ISLC will forward a road map in protecting and safeguarding labour rights to the EU delegation. We are ready to work closely with the EU and the government to safeguard labour rights of employees.
Assistant Chairman of ISLC Anton Marcus also said that the road map to assert labour rights in Sri Lanka will be forwarded to the EU delegation for their consideration.
He added that most of private sector employees are not paid well and their labour rights have been badly suspended by their bosses compared with state sector.
The minimum salary of the private sector is Rs 13,000. With all perks including overtime payments most of the employees draw a monthly salary of Rs 20,000 especially in the garment sector, he said.
