Wanton killing of elephants
It is very disturbing to hear about the shooting of tuskers to extract their tusks for business purposes. The latest is the shooting of the most loving animal Dala Puttuwa  that displayed the faunal beauty of this country.
This is a despicable activity perpetrated by some heartless individuals and without any hesitation, the perpetrators must be meted out with a deterrent punishment.
Elephants are a blessing to this small tropical island and some individuals who are ignorant of their faunal value, are attempting to wipeout this magnificent animal from this country.
Tourists take a personal interest to observe the wild elephants at Sri Lankas natural habitats.
Of late, the destruction of these animals and their habitats are accelerated by the various activities of man, like encroaching on their natural surroundings for agricultural and other purposes. Thereby, these innocent animals are displaced from their natural habitats and are forced to roam about in desperation.
The number of elephants that have been knocked down by trains are innumerable. Various traps have been placed to harm these animals besides shooting them when they enter villages. The extinction of this animal from the country is inevitable through these blatant acts by people.
It is high time to explore an effective programme to arrest the further shooting of these animals and protect them as they have a right to live in this land.
On an initial step, may I suggest that the field officers of the WildLife Department be converted into a Task Force like in the Congo and establish units in appropriate places to supervise the movements of these animals, along with other wild animals like the Cheetah and Sambhur etc.

The Coffee Bean is now back at the Bandaranaike International Airport with a slicker, bolder and more contemporary look. Since it was first opened in 2006, The Coffee Bean and Tea Leafs airport store has been the first and longest running international franchise at the BIA.
The airport store embodies the CBTL philosophy of a home away from home - comfort and familiarity no matter where you go in the world. The franchise is one of the worlds most well-known brands, easily recognized by customers for its distinctive purple and white design. The Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf first opened in 1963 in Hollywood, Los Angeles. Ten years later, the Airport Bean served its 3 millionth customer.
The Coffee Bean remains the quintessential Hollywood brand- every celebrity has been snapped with a familiar CBTL takeaway cup in their hand.

Today, over three million customers walk into Coffee Bean stores around the world every day.
The airport store reopens with a modern contemporary aesthetic. The new Coffee Bean design replaces the old darker wood with a brighter and slicker new California vibe. More grab and go food and beverages are available at the outlet. A more efficient layout has created more seating capacity and a larger kitchen with a full walk in chiller facility, ready to drum up an exciting and extensive variety of food and beverages.

However, the prosecution provided insufficient evidence against the defendant at the trial that followed. Hence, the accused was acquitted due to uncorroborated evidence on February 28.

## Title: Cumaratunga Munidasas 74th death anniversary falls today: THE DOYEN OF SINHALA JOURNALISM
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, March 2, 2018 - 01:00
Cumaratunga Munidasas 74th death anniversary falls today: THE DOYEN OF SINHALA JOURNALISM
The origin of the Lak Mini Pahana, the premier Sinhala newspaper goes back to 156 years, and to be exact, its first appearance was on September 11, 1862. Its editor was pundit Koggala Dharmathike. During the next 42 years, its editorship changed from hand to hand including pundit M. Dharmaratne, during whose stewardship it was developed into a more advanced newspaper.
After a lapse of a few years, it was Cumaratunga Munidasa who revived the defunct Lak Mini Pahana in 1934 (June 20, 1934), and brought it into a recognizable newspaper with added features to attract a larger readership and enhance its circulation. However, the first act of Cumaratunga since he took over its editorship was to correct its title by changing it from Lak Mini Pahana to Lak Mini Pahana.
Pahana is stone or rock, while pahana is lamp, that eliminates darkness and brings light. A collection of editorials written by Cumaratunga Munidasa since he became the editor of Lak Mini Pahana was published by the Subanda Havula in 1984, under the title Pahan Katu Veki on the eve of the completion of 50 years of Cumaratunga's editorship of the paper. This publication was edited by Professor Bandusena Gunasekara. The most recent collection of the Lak Mini Pahana Editorials was published by the Cumaratunga Munidasa Trust in 2006.
Objectives ofCumaratunga'sLak Mini Pahana
Unless the context demands descriptive writing Cumaratunga style of writing is often lucid and precise. Therefore, in his own inimitable style, Cumaratunga spells out in the anniversary issue of the Lak Mini Pahana, the objectives for which the paper stands.
For the advancement of the nation, the language and the religion, the national dignity, thoughts and ideas and also, for the eradication of falsehood, hypocrisy, pusillanimity, thralldom and ineptitude.
However, the main purpose of penning this short essay is not to talk about the unique contribution he made to Sinhala journalism, as journalism is commonly described as a form of glorified commercialism. A close analysis of the editorials carried in the Lak Mini Pahana during the editorship of Cumaratunga Munidasa would reveal that he exalted the editorial writing to greater heights, the features of which could only be paralleled to a handful of newspapers that still safeguard and maintain the virtues expected of a true editorial.
Virtues of a true newspaper editorial
Interesting  Significant  Current topic
Adopting different writing techniques and styles that the readership could emulate
Collecting relevant facts/information
Arguing why it is an issue  Impact on Society
Explaining different/opposing points of view
Logically refuting/rejecting points of view and contradictions
highlighting some good points  showing the writer is rational and considerate
Strengthening the editor's point of view
Concluding/ending with a powerful punch
Usage of Standard Language - (Loose composition will nullify the effect while losing faith in the writing and the writer)
Lak Mini Pahana Editorial
on the Birth of Jesus Christ
All the above virtues are to be seen in the editorial published in the Lak Mini Pahana on December 18, 1934. The introductory paragraph highlights the relevance and importance of celebrating the birth anniversary or the birth of Jesus Christ.
The editor says that although he doesn't belong to the same faith we are bonded to celebrate this all-important day as all of us are human beings. He also says that Jesus Christ is the Prince of Peace everyone has a right to join in celebrating his birthday. Christ devoted his entire life to the service of mankind and, endeavoured to drive home the fact that people are equal. Cumaratunga says that Christ's very mission of spreading the message of equality and brotherhood are reasons for everyone to rejoice.
He took the side of the oppressed against their oppressors, that of the dim multitude, not that of the privileged few. As a clever artist the editor of Lak Mini Pahana narrates how Jesus Christ appearing amidst a gathering whose intention was to stone the woman who was alleged to have committed adultery; one of the most dramatic and beautiful stories in which Jesus says All right, but let the one who has never sinned throw the first stone! The editor asks how many such delightful stories should we bring about to praise you This is how Cumaratunga pictures the incident:
(The woman caught for committing an offence not becoming of womanhood, was seen shivering and lying on the floor frightened of being killed. Villains saying This woman who has committed such a debased act should be stone and killed, were also seen frowning and growling, with heavy stones in their hands. Having heard of this commotion you were also seen walking calmly and serenely to the scene. The silver tinkling sounds that came out of your youth to inquire into the incident were pleasing to the ears. It was not that the unpleasant utterings of the villains who accused the hapless woman were not heard. What did you say Let anyone who has not committed a single wrongdoing pelt the first stone at her! Lord Jesus, what a miracle There isn't a single hand raised. There isn't a single stone getting released from the hands. How did you become aware of the true nature of mankind)
This very composition is seen as similar to the imagery created by Vidyachakravarthi, the author of the Buthsarana, when he composed the piece of lively writing on the ferociousness of the elephant. It is the figurative language of the highest order, depicting the demeanours of the two contrasting characters, and to be more specific, describing the serenity of the Buddha pitted against the ferociousness of the elephant.
Cumaratunga being thoroughly familiar and conversant with the literary marvels of the yesteryear brought forth the literary styles in contexts where the current idiom was not seen as adequately expressive. Cumaratunga thus while creating the desired mental picture, taught the readership the descriptive efficacy of the Sinhala language. He was primarily a linguist. Its no wonder, therefore, that he wrote his editorials in the highest possible idiom.
Conclusion witha powerful punch
The unusual length of the particular editorial amply shows how much the editor was interested in the topic. In the concluding paragraphs he stresses the following two important facts:
Jesus Christ was an easterner and is eastern doctrine was instrumental in creating a disciplined and civilized society in the west. But how ungrateful are those westerners who demean/degrade the easterners
The editor is much concerned with the unity that needs to be established between Buddhist and Christian communities in the country. He says that the common factor that could bring about this much-desired unity is the language. He, therefore, proposes that all should contribute to preserve, enrich and develop our language which provides the common link.
Richness of Lak MiniPahana Editorials
The editorial of the Lak Mini Pahana is sufficient proof that Cumaratunga's sole intention was to enrich the society from all fronts. This noble cause he followed assiduously as he believed that a newspaper editorial influences public opinion, and has a significant impact on the society. The issues he deliberated in his editorials were, therefore, carefully selected, and as he never followed a path of hypocrisy his writings were truthful, bold, upright and straightforward. The way he endeavoured to uplift the society by being selective in the topics he chose for his writings was based on the dictum that newspaper editorials should function as the schoolmasters of the common man'.
Some of the editorials Cumaratunga chose for the Lak Mini Pahana were: The discipline of our children; Our Language; Our Servitude; Sinhala Schools; Our Independence; Spoken Sinhala; The respect of teachers; The future of the House of Representatives; Improper conduct of teachers; Publication of books; Regional administration; Selection of school text books; Fear of diseases; The country's crimes; Education of Ceylon; The budget of the coming year; Cabinet of ministers; The teaching profession; Elections; Temperance movement Corruption of the Buddhist Order; Fear of ignorance; and Mutual co-operation. These reflected some of the more important issues the then society considered as having an impact on the society.
Argumentative writing- a hallmark ofCumaratunga-writing
Argumentative writing is writing that presents the writer's claim on an issue. In such instances, the editor assumes the role similar to that of a lawyer. Such an essay is treated as a genre of writing that requires the student to investigate a topic; collect, generate, and evaluate evidence; and establish a position on the topic in a concise manner. The objective of argumentative writings is to drive home the fact that one should accept as truth only after he is convinced that sufficient evidence is available to establish a claim. While Cumaratunga used irrefutable evidence based on reliable sources, his editorials influenced public opinion, promote critical thinking and sometimes caused people to take action on an issue.
To quote Professor Bandusena Gunasekera Cumaratunga achieved his aim through the Lak Mini Pahana. It stood in the forefront of Sinhala journalism. It showed the progressive way to journalism and provided a model for contemporary and succeeding newspapers. The specific quality of the Lak Mini Pahana editorials was the strict observance of the Sinhala idiom and the correct usage, the technique of verbal coherence, an emphasis of thought and impression and penetration. The topics were nationally significant and important. They were fearlessly critical, fair and unique in style.

Dimo wins ACCA Sustainability  Reporting overall award
Diesel and Motor Engineering PLC (DIMO) clinched the overall award as Sri Lankas most transparent company at the ACCA Sri Lanka Sustainability Reporting Awards while Hatton National Bank PLC was adjudged the overall runner up.
A total of fourteen awards were presented at a gala awards ceremony presided by the South African High Commissioner Robina P Marks as the Chief Guest.
The demands of the 21st century urge that companies can no longer operate in the same way as before. New tools are required if companies are to be responsive in a world that is changing. The sustainability issue is a critical consideration for boards of companies and has to be embedded in its long-term strategy. The chartered accountancy industry therefore has a valuable and indispensable role to play in Sri Lanka, said the High Commissioner.
ACCAS Sustainability Reporting Awards is therefore an indispensable tool that can assist companies with its on-going relationships between the company and its stakeholders in developing strategy. In this regard, best practices from South African companies are instructive in demonstrating how companies can achieve long term sustainability, responsive to the needs of companies and society as a whole. she added.
ACCA Sri Lanka with its pay off line, Think ahead has endeavoured in felicitating Sri Lankas best sustainability reports via Sustainability Reporting Awards for over 14 years.
ACCA Sri Lanka Member Network Panel President, Adrian Perera congratulating winners who have conformed to the criteria indicators of completeness, credibility and communication said, each winning report had clearly acknowledged and demonstrated economic, environmental and social impacts on internal and external stakeholders.
We at ACCA believe that if Sri Lanka is to develop itself to become the true pearl of the Indian Ocean, businesses must come up with strategies that are not only viable but also sustainable in the long run, he said.
Franklyn Amerasinghe the head of judging panel said that having observed an increasing number of integrated reports being entered into the fray, the judges noted more strategic thinking in relation to sustainability, encouraging all organizations to move towards this approach.
Sri Lanka is among 25 countries globally where 3,000 entities worldwide use a predetermined methodology in sustainability reporting which falls within the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) blueprint.

Early Warning  System to undergo significant  improvements
The current Early Warning System will undergo significant improvements by 2020 with the setting up of Sub-Regional Centre of Regional Integrated Multi-Hazard Early Warning System (RIMES) in Sri Lanka, Meteorology Department Chief K.H.M. S.Premalal said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the Director General said the proposed Centre will attract regional meteorological experts and researchers to Sri Lanka.
He said the proposed Centre will help improve his Departments capacity to issue more accurate weather bulletins and early warning messages on natural hazards such as landslides, floods, tsunamis, drought, cyclones, heavy rains and strong winds.
The decision to establish a sub-regional centre of RIMES in Sri Lanka was taken at its third ministerial meeting in Papua New Guinea in August 2017, to which a delegation led by Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa attended. The Centre will be opened in 2020 parallel to the fourth Ministerial Meeting of RIMES scheduled in Sri Lanka.
Premalal said it will be an opportunity for the country to grasp the latest technologies being used in the field, new software for weather forecasting and early warning, and new research outputs.
This will enable his Department to develop the countrys weather forecast, early warning system and long term climate projections, Premalal added.
He said RIMES, as part of this project, will provide technical and financial support to improve early warning on ocean hazards, adding that it will enhance the Departments marine weather forecast issued to fishing and naval communities on rough seas and strong winds. He added another aspect of the project will be improvements to climate service and climate projection.
As a result we will be able to disseminate more reliable climate-related information to various sectors such as the agriculture and irrigation. Long term climate projection will also see an improvement, Premalal added.
The Cabinet on Tuesday approved a Cabinet Paper presented by Minister Anura Yapa to construct a two storied building in the Meteorology Department premises to house the RIMES Sub-Regional Centre.
Local funds would be utilized for the construction of the building and purchasing office equipment to it.

Commenting on the initiative Co-Chief Operating Officer of Edirisinghe Brothers' Hybrid Hub, Sanka Edirisinghe said, Hybrid vehicles are somewhat different from conventional petrol or diesel powered vehicles in terms of the technology involved and requires a different approach to maintenance. This specialty approach is vital in order to prevent expensive repairs which may occur at a later period.
Vignettes of the event
Hybrid vehicles require technicians and service advisors with in-depth knowledge about the technology behind the vehicle as well as specific training. Hence, we at Hybrid Hub use our dedicated training facilities to follow onsite training combined with online training programmes with our technology partners based in the U.S.A. and Singapore. We consider it an honour to partner with the leading Motor Insurer - Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation to initiate programmes such as this to create awareness of Hybrid vehicle maintenance.
The Hybrid vehicle clinic held in December saw over 50 of SLIC customers and walk-in customers treated to a free health-check and diagnosis of their hybrid vehicles and were educated on the vast technology and vehicle operating best practices tips by Hybrid Hub specialists.
With the Sri Lankan Hybrid vehicle market growing, SLIC was keen to address many of our customers predicament of being unaware of basic maintenance knowledge required for a Hybrid vehicle.
The last Hybrid Vehicle Clinic with Hybrid Hub was well received by our MotorPlus customers and from other Hybrid vehicle owners. Given the positive response and to provide a further opportunity for those who would have missed the clinic in December 2017, multiple clinics will be introduced to include regions such as the Central Province. SLIC being a pioneer in the insurance sector, it was important for us to partner with a like-minded partner with industry expertise - we are indeed privileged to collaborate with Edirisinghe Brothers, commented a spokesperson from SLIC.
Hybrid vehicles unlike the traditional petrol and diesel vehicles, is a technology centric vehicle that requires preventive maintenance on a periodical basis, to mitigate unnecessary and expensive repairs. Combined experience and market insights by both Hybrid Hub and MotorPlus has helped to identify a considerable shortage in understanding preventive maintenance and service facilities that are specialized for hybrid vehicles.
With the initiation of similar programmes, Hybrid Hub and SLIC hope to generate further awareness and understanding of the inner works of Hybrid vehicles and the need for specialized care.

Election laws should benefit  people, country - SP Chief Minister
A new election mechanism when introduced, it should be formulated and implemented under a simple and practically productive method avoiding unwarranted complexities and distortions in peoples representations, following the results of respective elections, Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva said.
Therefore, when making changes to the existing law, they should be framed with utmost care and after extensive research and study in such a way which is benifical to both the people and the country,the Southen Province Chief Minister further added.
He made the above observations commenting on the post Local Government Elections developments in the country when questioned by the media.
Provisions for right womens representation in the supreme Legislature and other governing authorities is quite a factual obligation and right as a policy, he said.
However, the recent laws introduced with regard to womens representation in Local Government Bodies have generated practical problems and unseen complexities, he said.
The people could not accept the new election law because the provisions for the increase in womens representation up to 25 per cent have created unexpected technical hitches in the implementations of the new election law.

Elizabeth Moir International School: Expanding horizons through drama
Endless horizons and limitless possibilities is what Elizabeth Moir International School is about. The school makes sure that their students have a wholesome education. Dramatic Moves interviews the members of English Drama Club of Elizabeth Moir who are equipped with skills needed to carry them into the future.
Personality development
Drama Teacher Anushka Senanayake, commented on the importance drama plays in the life of an adolescent. For some of us adolescence is a time we cherish and enjoy but for others it is a time that hold painful memories. However Drama can play a critical role in the life of an adolescent.
At any stage in life, drama can play a huge role in your personality development. Especially in adolescence some students may feel insecurities because they are discovering what they believe in and what they stand for, what they might find funny or sad. Drama is a nice avenue through which they can explore those things. It is an easy way to make friends and learn how to collaborate. There are a lot of little lessons you can learn through taking part in a production, said Senanayake.
She believes that one doesnt necessarily have to act but being a part of the crew, the designing team or the production team can help one to develop.
Drama gets people to come out of their shell. It builds up so much confidence, and for me it is wonderful to see students who are very shy or never speak up, break out of that. It helps them grow. They not only discover what they believe in and stand for, but also it teaches practical skills such as time management, organizational skills, respect each other and being able to hear other peoples ideas and learning how to share ideas. You even learn how to agree and disagree and work towards a common goal, pointed out Senanayake.
Senanayake feels that doing drama will certainly help a student adjust to the different roles you will have to play in your life. It can help you develop a sense of identity and the type of person you will become.
In addition to the subject matter, they learn in school and outside school, this is just one more tool that will help students discover things they enjoy or dont enjoy. It involves a lot of practical skills. It touches on humanity, so playing these different roles and observing other actors playing other roles, and just by being engaged with theatre, it opens their eyes, to different cultures, and different ways of living and thinking, things that they might not be usually are exposed to, explains Senanayake.
Theatre covers so many areas that your academic education may not cover. It pushes you to see things from different points of view. Thespians explore different stories, people from different backgrounds and culture  the different worlds they immerse themselves in, which will lead to a much more sensitive person.
Winning hearts
President of the drama club, Areeb Thassim feels that his journey in drama is something that makes him very proud. In the course of time he has widened his repertoire of skills.
Drama brings out a lot of things in you that you didnt know you already had. I never acted before until I came to Moir and now I am the Drama President. I have also discovered a lot of things about me as well, said Thassim.
Thassim had the good fortune of playing Prince Charming in Cinderella, which is a much coveted role amongst actors. Not only does this role involve a chivalrous demeanor, but the actor needs to step into a role that needs to win the hearts of the female audience. Thassim pulled it off really well.
My favourite character is Prince Charming in Cinderella which I did many years ago. A lot of people who have played the part have been charming, so the charm part is something that I enjoyed tackling. Yes I think I definitely pulled it off. When you are an actor you have to get into different mindsets. You have to become a different person. And to be a good actor you have to get into it really well. Over time you learn things about new characters that you didnt really know and you develop as a person. The most recent performance I went to see was Sound of Music. That was absolutely amazing. The whole production was amazing. Being part of the school English Drama club has been really fun and it has given me a sense of identity, explained Thassim.
Unearth new talents
Nicole Haddon rates her role as Lina Lamont in Singin in the Rain as one of her favourites. For her role as Lina Lamont, actress Jean Hagen was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress. The film Singin in the Rain was also nominated for Best Original Music Score for Lennie Hayton.
From the characters I have done Lina Lamont in Singin in the rain is my best mainly because that character was so different. It was definitely the most challenging and that was why I quite liked it. By doing drama you learn things about yourself you never even imagined. You have new experiences and you unearth new talents in yourself. You learn how to adapt to characterizations and improvise. Through every single different character you learn something different. Not only about that character but also about yourself and when you watch other people act, you see them adapt and overcome obstacles and you learn things by observing them, said Haddon.
Shakespeare in the Park  Othello is her favourite play and Haddon added that drama helps you express yourself in different ways which you did not think possible.
When I first joined Moir, I enrolled in the play Whose Life Is it Anyway and that was the start of my friendships and I made an identity in school, and people recognized me and my passion has grown with it as well, said Haddon.
Into spotlight
For Bjorn Paul his performance as Cosmo Brown really fascinated him. Paul, someone who was unheard at school, came into spotlight and drama transformed his life.
As an actor you get to explore other aspects of life, and how other people view life. I think the part I played in Singin in the Rain, the character of Cosmo Brown really stands out for me. I really liked playing that part because he was such a narcissist. I liked playing that character and trying to bring out the narcissism and that indirectly in a way actually helped me deal with some of my insecurities, said Paul
Paul pointed out that the chemistry in the group is definitely important if you want the play to work. Some time ago I watched My fair lady which up to today is one of my favourite plays. Their acting and characterization was really awesome and I still feel that it is the best play I have witnessed. Before I did drama at Moir I felt sort of invisible, so I think it has really helped me build up my identity, said Paul.
Kaavya Gnanam like Haddon and Paul too was relatively unknown until she took up drama. She feels that it has made her more empathetic.
Before I did drama I was really quiet and no one really knew who I was. But when I started doing drama more people got to know me and I felt confident in showing people who I really am. It has also helped me come out of my shell and discover myself, said Gnanam.
She also pointed out that during rehearsals you enter into the wondrous process of understanding personalities.
Especially when you play a character with a negative personality, you spend so much time working on that character, you start to understand who they are and the way they think. When I tap into a character that I am playing in any production, there are so many things I resonate with while figuring out things about me and my personality. The biggest thing is that acting gives you a sense of understanding and you get to a level of empathy.
We work as an ensemble cast, so we do a lot of different activities and make sure that everyone is comfortable with each other. I like the performance when my house did Mind Your Language at the Inter-House competition, I really liked it because we did so much with it really expanding on it, said Gnanama
Discover people
Tienn Kapilasena, who played the ugly sister in Cinderella needed to portray a darker side of society - a spiteful spinster who has plenty to feel nasty about. For a young man his age his efforts are indeed praiseworthy, since it is a role that is a challenge for even an experienced actor.
I have played some really weird characters that involved a lot of humor and these are some of the many things drama has helped me explore and allows me to discover new things through characters. One character I liked playing was the ugly sister in Cinderella because for me, when acting as a girl I am able to develop new skills, said Kapilasena
When you are acting you have to make yourself that character, and on stage you have to become that character, and you need to get into their shoes, so you definitely discover more about different people, he asserts.
My favourite play was the one we did recently  Singin in the Rain, because from Junior school to senior school there is such a big difference in the type of acting, so I got to explore the different types of genres. In real life when you say something to someone there is always the chance you will get a negative reaction, but in drama when you are on stage and you have those lines and you say it. And that helps you in real life because youve been exposed to responses that you would see in society, added Kapilasena.

EPIGENETIC EVOLUTION OF THE DRY ZONE TAMILS
It has now been universally accepted that all living things have to adapt to their environment to survive, or perish. The Tamils living in the inhospitable Dry Zone had to adapt to survive in it, unlike the lucky Sinhalese who live in the lush fertile Wet Zone.
The Tamils underwent a minor evolution called an Epigenetic Evolution, which involves a minor chemical change in the chromosomes, which had an effect in the bearers ability to adapt to the Dry Zone, as a survival technique.
The Dry Zone could not sustain the Tamils and the British did not have the technological ability to develop it in the early sixteenth century, when they made the island into a unitary state for the convenience of administration as they did in Africa and the other parts of their Empire.
English education
The Tamils were, therefore, forced to seek employment in the Wet Zone where the Sinhala majority lived. They were forced to acquire an English education in order to survive. The Sinhalese did not have such a worrying problem, in fact they refused to learn English until Colonel Henry Steele Olcott, who was an ardent Buddhist, encouraged the Sangha to open schools for the Sinhala Buddhist children. Besides the Sinhalese did not have the same survival motivation the Tamils had, who had to choose between education and starvation. So, throughout the years the Tamils became a more successful minority with a certain amount of job-denial for the Sinhalese. This naturally caused resentment and anger towards the Tamils.
This imbalance in education and employment had to be urgently redressed in order to avoid a serious destabilization in the country. SWRD Bandaranaike who wanted to be the Prime Minister at any cost, promised the Sinhala people that he would ban Tamil and English and have Sinhala Only if he was voted in as the next Prime Minister. The Sinhala naturally voted him in.
The Sangha and the Sinhala leadership lacked the wisdom to think forward and anticipate the natural repercussions of such a drastic move against the Tamil minority. It was like a declaration of war against the minorities. It was this that caused the immediate division of our country - by a mere stroke of the pen - as they say.
Ethnic war
The Epigenetic Evolution imbued the Tamils with better qualities for survival. It made them hardy and resilient, endowed them with a better work ethic. It made them docile and calm and put them off criminal activity.
The crime rate in the Dry Zone was almost negligible. The murder rate in the Wet Zone at one stage was within the first ten in the world because the Sinhalese are a very emotional and fiery people, although one of the kindest Buddhists when not roused!
The Epigenetic Evolution made the Tamils more successful which also led to their downfall and the 29-years-old ethnic war. The Tamils who were forced to emigrate, are continuing to live successful lives, especially in Canada and Australia.
The Sinhalese blame the divide and rule policy that contributed to the Epigenetic Evolution and Tamil success, which may be partly true, but it is the Environment Factor and the Epigentic evolution.

EUROPE SHIVERS, BRACES FOR FRESH BLIZZARDS
FRANCE: Fresh heavy snowfalls and icy blizzards were expected to lash Europe as the region shivers in a deadly deep-freeze that has gripped countries from the far north to the Mediterranean south.
Schools are shut and weather agencies predict the brutal cold will continue as the death toll from the freezing snap rose to around 48 since last Friday, with icy conditions causing accidents and endangering vulnerable rough sleepers.
In the latest deaths, a 60-year-old man perished after falling into a lake in London, while an elderly Dutch skater plunged through cracked ice in the western village of Hank.
The victims also include 18 people killed in Poland, six in the Czech Republic, five in Lithuania, four each in France and Slovakia, two each in Italy, Serbia, Romania and Slovenia and one in Spain.
The Siberian cold front -- dubbed the Beast from the East in Britain, Siberian bear by the Dutch and the snow cannon by Swedes -- has blanketed huge swathes of the region in snow and played havoc with transport networks.
In Scotland, which saw Glasgow airport closed until Thursday morning and most flights cancelled from Edinburgh, emergency services struggled to help drivers stranded for hours on a major motorway, with images showing scores of vehicles trapped in the snow late Wednesday.
This is a very difficult situation but everything possible is being done, Scottish leader Nicola Sturgeon said on Twitter.
Further blasts of wintery weather are expected, with authorities in Ireland and normally-balmy southern France among those to have issued red alerts late Wednesday.
Homeless people account for many of the dead, and cities across Europe have been racing to open emergency shelters to protect people sleeping rough. In Germany, the national homeless association urged shelters to open during the day and not just at night.
You can die of cold during the day too, its chief Werena Rosenke warned.
Authorities are also urging people to look out for elderly relatives and neighbours after a French woman in her nineties was found frozen to death outside her retirement home.
In Paris, where up to 5cm of snow was expected overnight, some 50 regional lawmakers were to spend Wednesday night on the streets to protest the denial of dignity suffered by those without roofs over their heads.
And in the northern port of Calais, authorities were launching emergency plans to shelter migrants who camp out near the coast hoping to stow away on trucks bound for Britain.

From the fantastic to the realistic
Title:Channels Volume 23:Journal of the English Cooperative of Sri Lanka
Author:Edited by Gnana Moonesinghe
The Journal of the English Cooperative of Sri Lanka is now on its 23rd issue, and celebrates this milestone with a thrilling anthology mixing short stories, poetry, and essays. As always, this volume too encourages, to quote Gnana Moonesinghe, the editor, "individual writers who enjoy writing, be they novices or experienced writers..." As a writer whose first ever published work appeared in Channels almost two decades ago, it is with immense pleasure that I read this volume, rejoicing in the fact that the journal 'continues to fill the lacunae in the limited space available for writers to publish their creative writing.'
The fiction in Volume 23 ranges far and wide. The anthology opens with Sunila Nanayakkara telling us of the plight of poverty-stricken rural women (End of the Spell,) Samya Senaratne focuses on child abuse (Child's Play) while Kamini Liyanage provides a bleak, heartbreaking portrayal of life after retirement (The Grey Multitude.) Titus de Silva's tale of misunderstanding between lovers (Yes Dear,) and Haseena Iraz's dilemma with the squirrel besotted by the flowers in her garden (The Fiend)are laden with humor while attempting to communicate a deeper message beyond the surface hilarity. Hana Mohamed spins a surreal tale centering around New York city (The Recruit).
Elsewhere, the disabled, (He Published no Book, Rohini Gamage)a single parent (Always, In Always, Venessa Andrea Nugara), an estranged marriage (Kismet, Romola de Mel) run the gamut from the experimental to the fantastic to the deeply realistic.
There are more traditional contributions,too, particularly in the essay category. Vijita Fernando expertly delineates some of the highlights of being a woman and a writer in Sri Lanka. I'm sure all of us who have been touched by their generosity, kindness and enlightening advice will agree with her when she writes; " Creative writing in Sri Lankan women have been greatly encouraged by a number of women who are themselves writers and whose ideas and criticism have influenced many of us writers. Among those the names of Lakshmi de Silva, Yasmine Gooneratne, Neloufer de Mel, Manique Gunasekera, Ranjini Obeysekere come to mind".
Nanda Pethiyagoda-Wanasundera admirably portrays five Sri Lankan women writers "born and bred in Ceylon/Sri Lanka" whose work and personalities, she says, have impacted on her to a great degree; They are Dr. Lakshmi de Silva, Vijita Fernando, Jean Arsanayagam, Madhubashini Ratnayake, and Manuka Wijesignhe. She explains, "Each is different from the other, but a deep sense of Sri Lankaness and pride in being women are discernible in their work and in them."
The two essays are detailed, clearand readable pieces, and their presence next to stories about the grief of losing a pet,(Time to Call it a Day, K.K.S Perera, Morty, Nelani Goonawardena) invigorate both sides of the essay/fiction divide.
The section on poetry provokes readers to new experiences of elucidating opacity, analyzing complexity, and discovering, in the magic of these creations, meanings for themselves. The poems are: Smoked Fruit, Kamini Liyanage, A Monkey's Point of View, Denis De Rosayro, Insanity: A Flair or a Flow, Upeksha Bandara, A Sigiri Damsel Needs Help, Dishani Senaratne, Conflict, Honeida Pakeer, Natami, Sunila Nanayakkara, Judgment, Sanjiva Wijesinha, Chees, M.T.L Ebell, Apology to a Fallen Tree, Punyakante Wijenaike, The Last Crest, A Mortal of a Lesser Kind, A Vine Rediscovered, Sakuntala Sachithanandan, See the Scene at a Colombo Club, Summer Chorus, Nature's Parachutes, Vince (Lochnera) Rosea, Jayanthi Kaththriarachchi, Death of a Renaissance Man, I Once was Blind, Plea to Gara Yaka, Chitra Premaratne Stuiver, and I knew an Escape Route, Basil Fernando. The poems are eloquent, short, clear, and concise.
The structure of the anthology, with fiction, poetry and essay alternating throughout, invites consideration of what journey is taking place in the transition from one to the other-what borderline is crossed in the process, what marks each territory as distinct from the other. With the back and forth, back and forth of this sojourn from the real, to the fake, to the imagined, in this issue of Channels showing us in a remarkably mature and breathtaking style a series of twists and turns in the lives of quite ordinary people - school teachers, poor women, married folks and those courting couples, pensioners, and pet owners,as well as the imagined, Aetos Dios, the Sigiri damsels, the reader receives at all times a glimpse of the varied approaches writers and poets take towards revealing the truth about life, about relationships, about us.
Channels Volume 23 makes for terrific reading for the heart, as well as the soul.

Floating liquefied National Gas terminals
Feasibility study to commence soon
A comprehensive feasibility study to establish a Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) terminal and Floating Natural Gas terminal within the Colombo South Harbour will commence this month, Sri Lanka Ports Authority (SLPA) Chairman Dr. Parakrama Dissanayake said.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday, the SLPA Chairman said the feasibility study will look at not only the financial viability but also the environmental and safety issues of the project.
He said a trilateral Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) between Sri Lanka, Japan and India on a LNG terminal and Floating Storage Regasification Unit (FSRU) will be inked next week and the feasibility study will commence shortly after that.
Dissanayake said the LNG terminal will be located at the end of the Colombo South Container Terminal.
The feasibility study will be carried out by independent third party analyzers and special attention will be paid to safety issues as it is going to be inside a harbour. An underground pipeline will have to be laid to pump the gas from the Western container terminal to a facility in Sapugaskanda or Kerawalapitiya, but it is still premature to comment, he said.
The project to build the LNG terminal and FSRU will be a joint venture by Sri Lanka Ports Authority with Japan and India.
According to the joint Cabinet Paper presented by Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickrama and Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe, the Sri Lanka Government (Sri Lanka Gas Terminal LTD) will have 15 percent stake in the joint venture, while Petronet LNG Ltd of India will hold 47.5 percent stake and Sojits Corporation and Mitsubishi Company of Japan will hold 37.5 percent shareholding. Cabinet approved it on Tuesday.
LNG is relatively a new energy source to Sri Lanka and this will be the countrys first LNG project. LNG is natural gas that has been converted to liquid form for ease and safety of storage or transport.
According to Government sources,the LNG terminal, which will import super-cooled natural gas in ships, will take about three years to complete.

Fitch rates Peoples Insurance A+(lka)/Stable
Fitch Ratings has assigned Peoples Insurance PLC a National Insurer Financial Strength (IFS) Rating and National Long-Term Rating of A+(lka). The outlook is stable.
The ratings reflect the non-life insurers strong domestic business profile, which is supported by its association with the Peoples Bank (Sri Lanka) (PB, AA+(lka)/Stable) group, strong capitalisation and adequate profitability metrics. The company has an operating history of eight years and is focused mainly on the motor segment - 84% of Gross Written Premiums (GWP) in 2017.
The companys business profile is supported by the strong Peoples brand name associated with its banking parent. Over 80% of Peoples Insurances business was channelled from the group in 2017, mainly by way of referrals from its immediate parent, Peoples Leasing & Finance PLC (PLF, B/AA-(lka)/Stable), a leading vehicle leasing financier in Sri Lanka. Peoples Insurance operates predominantly via 124 window offices placed inside PLF and Peoples Bank (PB) branches, which promote cross selling to PLF and PB clients. The group has helped the company achieve a medium non-life market share of 5.2%, as measured by GWP, in 2016.
Fitch Ratings believes the Peoples brand will also help the company expand its non-group related business. Peoples Insurance is a 75% subsidiary of PLF, which in turn is a 75% subsidiary of PB. PLF is one of Sri Lankas largest non-bank financial institutions, while PB is the countrys second-largest bank and is fully owned by the government of Sri Lanka (B+/Stable). Peoples Insurance accounted for 4.6% and 0.5% of PLFs and PBs total assets, respectively, at end-September 2017.
Fitch sees Peoples Insurances financial performance and earnings as strong. The companys low-cost window-office distribution strategy means its expense ratio of 26% in 2017 (2016: 23%) is lower than that of the industry (9M17: 38%, 2016: 36%), leading to a combined ratio of 95% in 2017 and 94% in 2016, well below that of the industry (9M17: 103%, 2016: 105%).

Focus on investment
Foreign Direct Investments (FDI) are a vital lifeline for any country. Sri Lanka was one of the first countries to open its doors to foreign investors following the liberalization of the economy in 1977 and the establishment of Free Trade Zones soon afterwards. The Government also set up a Board of Investment (BOI), a one-stop facility for the benefit of investors. Today, Sri Lanka is seen as a prime destination for foreign investors and joint venture partners.
There are two main avenues for FDI. The first is the Colombo Stock Exchange, where foreigners are very active. The other is the more traditional method of setting up investments such as export-oriented factories. It is important to encourage both types of investment. Last year, Sri Lanka recorded around US$ 1.3 billion in FDI inflows. China, India, Singapore, Netherlands, UK, Japan, Malaysia, Sweden and Australia are among the leading investor countries. The manufacturing and services sectors have seen the larger share of FDI inflows  of nearly US$ 400 million while the infrastructure and utilities sectors received US$ 350 million. According to the Ministry of Development Strategies and International Trade, merchandise exports grew 10.3% to US$ 9.5 billion in the 10 months to October 2017 with monthly exports topping US$ 1 billion thrice.
These are impressive numbers, but we have barely scratched the surface as the potential for improvement is huge. In comparison, Singapore attracts around US$ 50 billion in FDI each year. This example is significant in several ways. First, Sri Lanka and Singapore are strategically located islands (Sri Lanka is the gateway to SAARC while Singapore is the gateway to ASEAN) which have excellent port and airport facilities. Second, Sri Lanka and Singapore have excellent air links with citizens enjoying visa-free access to each others countries. Third, Sri Lanka recently signed a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) with Singapore, which was its first with a South Asian country. The FTA should see increased trade and investment between the two friendly island states. Singaporean and Sri Lankan companies will enjoy potential tariff savings and other benefits through the FTA.
Fourth, investments from Singapore should see a further boost following the Invest Sri Lanka Investor Forum which is being held today at the Four Seasons Hotel in Singapore. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe will deliver the keynote address, which will focus on Sri Lankas investment potential. He will offer perspectives on the outlook for Sri Lanka and investment opportunities across sectors in the Sri Lankan economy, with a specific focus on investment in the Sri Lankan Stock Market.
The investor forum organised by the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE), the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) of Sri Lanka and the Singapore - Sri Lanka Business Association (SLBA) has attracted a large number of investors from all countries in the region. A number of Sri Lankan companies including, John Keells Holdings, Hemas, Hayleys, Commercial Bank, Access Engineering, Hatton National Bank, DFCC Bank, Laugfs, Softlogic, Lion, Walkers CML, Sunshine Holdings, Singer Sri Lanka, NDB Bank and Sampath Bank will also participate.
Investors will also be able to get insights from Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the Governor of the Central Bank, hear from foreign investors on the Sri Lankan experience, update themselves on investment opportunities in portfolio and direct investment and meet representatives of 15 leading Sri Lankan listed companies representing multiple industries on a 1:1 basis. Such one on one meetings are generally very productive and almost always result in a venture.
The investor forum cum roadshow has previously been held in the United States, Australia, New Zealand, United Arab Emirates, India, Switzerland and Hong Kong with tangible results. Many new investors have entered Sri Lanka following these forums.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghes participation at this forum will also send a strong signal to the international community, both business and political, that Sri Lanka has a politically stable administration. There was unfortunately some sort of uncertainty following the February 10 Local Government election, which had confused investors. The fact that both President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe have pledged to continue and reinforce the National Unity Government has instilled confidence in the investor community, which was looking for political and financial stability. It is also vital to stabilize the Rupee and ensure other economic fundamentals to woo investors.
It is also essential to eliminate corruption if Sri Lanka wants to attract more foreign investors. It is a well-known secret that many foreign investors turned away from Sri Lanka during the previous regime because they could not grant the kickbacks demanded by some of the countrys key figures. The President and the Prime Minister have renewed the fight against corruption, which will be appreciated by the investor community. Eliminating red tape is another important step. No foreign investor will want to be driven from pillar to post when applying to set up a venture here. The BOI must be further streamlined to offer a more convenient and all-inclusive service to investors. A highly comprehensive investment policy is needed to attract more investors and ensure long-term economic development.

Glorious glamping at Yurts
Juliet Coombe goes glamourous camping, known as glamping in the wilds of Cornwall, England, and discovers the allure of the Mongolian Yurts that offer the real off the grid environmentally friendly way to travel.
I first experienced yurts on the Silk Route to Kashgar, where all rivers of life run in a place where you can now buy anything from silken negligee to your own Mongolian Yurts. Today these nomadic tents are no longer just strapped on the backs of camels crossing vast wildernesses, but are also part of an exciting new lifestyle Real Glamping in The Fir Hill, Cornwall.
This is the perfect family holiday experience for those who fancy the spirit of nomadic life style in style rather than eating hunks of bread with sugar lumps melted on a wood burner on the Silk Road. Being a girl that prefers high heels to spending a whole holiday in walking boots and a sea of blue duvet to a coir woven coarse scratchy blanket with a delicious cup of sweet tea, then this is the place for a people that enjoy an off the grid adventure in the safety of a wooden structure that celebrates the deep ancient reverie of being at one with nature. From the moment you open the azure blue wooden door, one can only be amazed by the size of these family yurts that make one feel like an ancient mariner travelling across boundless oceans to undiscovered exotic lands.
These huge tented rooms are perfect for lovers of the great outdoors, passionate about living history and truly making an environmental difference through all the amazing things you will learn over a week glamping in a place still famous for its curses and witchcraft. The Fir Hill estate over the centuries has had more than its fair share of bedevilment and this is all part of the fun of the place, which is surrounded by woods where you will discover a tree that fairies live in where money is left, protected bat caves, ancient mine shafts, and ruins from a time when The Fir Hill estate was considered to have the finest Manor House in Cornwall all of which you will learn more about on the exciting Trespassers and Hoblyn Historic walks.]
Our sleeping accommodation nestled in this misty mystical ancient Hoblyn estate was truly stunning with its diamond pine trellising held together at the cross points by dried leather skin ties. As you sink into the softest mattresses you have ever slept on, positioned beautifully on artisan handmade beds, one can truly enjoy the beauty of looking up at the infinity of gnarled light brown knots and shapes, surrounded by white canvas, bound by two white circumnavigating ribbons that emerge as bindings as they grab, like rip tides, at the ships blue cockpit door holding the frame steady as she goes. You feel like a nomadic king of the waves flanked by two doubles in this deceptively spacious chieftan like stateroom and my arms are like Poseidon's tridents as they reach upwards to the ship's giant helm with the mornings light glowing through it, and at night you can see the stars and the full moon through this magical central point. The helm like skylight is also supported by 78 blue poles rising up from the trellis wall that subtly transforms from round to square to tapered oars as they ascend to the heavens and reflect the light back into this very special domain that makes it an unforgettable Yurtist experience.
The centre of my ger (yurt) is a glorious giant space galleon's wheel beautifully shaping the light as it enters this idyllic spot, an oasis for the soul nestled amongst Cornish hills, the distant rich green hedge lined fields dotted white with bleating springing lambs, overlooking a glasslike lake reflecting distant fluffy clouds and trees all around swaying gently in a light breeze as their leaves quietly whisper of the mysteries of this historic wood where the fern that gave the area its name can be found.
Over an action packed week you can explore the stunning local beaches including Fistral beach where they hold World Championships for surfing and Watergate Bay overlooking the Atlantic Ocean famous for its restaurant the Beach Hut. From here you can go to The Eden Project where they prove that transformation is not only in our nature, but also how to connect us all with the living world and through excellent daily tours the importance of plants for medicinal and many other forgotten purposes. Here you can learn more about the flora and fauna of the world and talk to experts about Asia at The Eden Project, including how to make Sri Lankan jaggery while being explained the importance of natural sweetness like cinnamon, which is so much better for you than refined white sugar. A fascinating day trip from Fir Hill is where you can learn from Hetty the skilled horticulturalist and Carla the story teller. On the way back you can buy produce from the local farmers gates and then cook it under the stars at The Fir Hill stunning barbecue areas.
Charlie Hoblyn the owner is twenty-fourth generation of family to live in this gorgeous area and the history one learns by walking with him and his family past ochre mines, through caves and, in the process, learning how bats are protected owing to their control of insects such as mosquitoes. It is the hidden history of this ancient woodland brought to life that makes this such a special experience like having the phosphorous algae pointed out and where the pathway forms a canal how one member of the family tried to build a water transport channel to send goods to Newquay. The most exciting part of the action packed tour was seeing the countrys only ochre mine operating from 1740 to 1900s, which includes a forty foot cave, that was hollowed out for its stunning orangey brown earthy dye, and then used as pigment for oil paintings and mixed with plaster for stucco facades on the Manor house, which tragically burnt down.
This beautifully links back to the choice of the yurt as a living structure that reflects the use of surrounding natural materials for building in resourceful and artistic ways with no permanent impact on the land. Like his ancestors who were also guardians of the land, Charlie Hoblyn has used the felled trees for building the architecturally stunning communal mindfulness spaces with roaring fires and showers powered from solar panels. The beams and hand crafted tables and coffee mats were all created from the estate trees - a mix of oak, sycamore, chestnut and ash.
The Hoblyns have been artists for generations and you will see some of Charlie Hoblyns colourful master pieces on the walls of the main buildings and even a cheeky smaller painting can be found in the outside compost loo. Always look twice at them as they hide hidden scenes, which allow both children and adults to enjoy their masterly beauty. Like the wheel of life Charlie Hoblyn has returned to his spiritual home land Cornwall while juggling his other home in France, that coincidently also produces ochre in the clay hills. Like his ancestors he believes that stewardship of the land is essential for sustaining the future of a balanced life.

HEYN, classiest of left handed bats in pre Test cricket era
Left hand batsmen, like left arm bowlers are a rarity in cricket. And when they do come, they are graceful, elegant, stylish and eye catching treats to watch when in action as batsmen or bowlers.
PETER DAVID HEYN belonged to the class of classy left hand batsmen that Sri Lanka has produced. Although not in the class of the international players HEYN , could have blossomed into one if Sri Lanka in his time had the chance to play international cricket.
A product of St.Peters College, Bambalapitiya he joined the class of another Peterite from the same school, Clive Inman. Both sadly showed their magic long before Sri Lanka was welcome as a Test nation by the arrogant lords at Lords.
In Colin Bland class
HEYN not only showed his excellence as a left hand stroke player, but also as a cover fielder of the calibre of South Africas Colin Bland. Had HEYN been born after Sri Lankas admission to the big league, he would certainly have been written in crickets history books.
But as a schoolboy and club cricketer first at the Burgher Recreation Club and later Nondescripts Cricket Club, he showed and proved his class that was far above an average cricketer that also had the promise and potential being bracketed with world class products.
HEYN played in two of the inaugural 1975 World Cup games against West Indies at Manchester on June 7 and against Pakistan at Nottingham on June 14, But failed to make a lasting impression. However in first class cricket in the country he showed his classic talent and potential playing 50 games scoring a bag full of 2625 runs with a highest score of 136. He also made 4 hundreds and 16 half centuries.
Pre Test cricket era
HEYN had it in him to join the classic left handers mentioned above, but unfortunately during the time he excelled in the game, the country had not attained Test status. As a left hand batsman, excellent cover fielder and penetrative medium pace bowler he would have been master class and a must in any word class team.
HEYN had a baptism of fire when he first made his debut for the country against the West Indies at the Colombo Oval in 1967. His selection was controversial and when he walked into bat a section of the spectators were baying for his blood, giving him a welcome boo to the centre.
But at the end it was HEYN who had the last laugh making a masterly 69 timing his shots and scoring with graceful sweeps and square cuts and at the end of his great knock that rescued his tea from 95 for 5 when he took guard his critics could not help but cheer him because that knocked helped Sri Lanka make over 400 with an unforgettable last wicket stand of 110 in 55 swashbuckling hitting by two former illustrious Thomian all rounders who are no more Ian Pieris and Neil Chanmugam.
Memorable tour
However his best and memorable tour was to India where against the home team who had world class spinners of the caliber of Bishen Singh Bedi, Chandrasekhar, Prasanna, Venkataraghaven, Shilvakar and Joshi he made scores of 100, 84, 30 and 50. After he quit the game in 1976 he left the shores to the home of cricket England and padded up for Richmond and Berkshire cc where after enjoying the game he loved best put aside his cricketing gear which would have hurt him inside which went to prove that all good things in life must come to an end.
On a personal note, I had the opportunity to play against and with him. First in inter-school cricket where he was my first victim when I took a hat-trick with three googlies. First HEYN stumped by Ranjit Fernando the second wicket was Tyronne Le Mercier who was bowled and then Aditha de Silva who was LBW. also failing to read the googly.
School game at Kotahena
This game was between St.Peters and St.Benedicts played at Kotahena in 1961. Later we were mates in the Board Presidents X1 that played Hong Kong under Michael Tissera in 1972.
Lankan left handers
Its apt to recall Sri Lankan lefties who joined that classiest of Internationals in Sanath Jayasuiriya and Kumar Sangakkara with Jayasuriya joining the 300 plus company when he made 340 against India.
While recalling these local heroes of our time its apt to reminisce on International left hand batsmen who left their indelible marks such as Australians Arthur Morris and Neil Harvey, Englands David Gower and of course the greatest lefties in our generation were the left handed Don Bradman Sir Garfield st. Auburn Sobers and Brian 'King' Charles Lara of the West Indies.
Sobers broke Sir Leonard Huttons record score of 364 that stood for a long time and Lara was simply great when he broke his countrymens record after seeing Australias left hander Matthew Hayden go past Laras record and then as if taking it as an insult made a glorious unbeaten 400 in a Test against England that will probably stand the test of time.
Incidentally an achievement that Sri Lanka could be well proud of is that Lara is the godfather of one of Sri Lankas leading businessman Gamini and Manel Edirisinghes grand daughter Sharmilka and daughter of Achira and Suresh Edirisinghe. Lara is a very dear friend of the Edirisinghe Bros the leading Auto Court people.
The HEYN'S are an integral part of Sri Lanka cricket where they gave their hearts and soul for the betterment of the game. HEYNS father Russel who was a Royalist too played hockey and cricket and later captained the country and after retirement headed the Sri Lanka Cricket Board for a few years. Rising to Major General he commanded the Army. Davids mum Edna was President of the Womens Hockey Federation for awhile. His brother Richard captained St.Peters at cricket and hockey and played for the BRC.

Resettlement and Rehabilitation State Minister M. L. A. M. Hizbullah sent an official letter to United Nations (UN) Secretariat Resident Coordinator in Colombo Nina Brandstrup on Wednesday, urging the UN to take immediate steps to resolve the current crisis in Syria.
In his letter, Hisbullah said:
"In the name of Allah, I urge all concerned parties to prevent the current carnage in Syria. I also appeal to all Muslim countries, to take immediate action with the coordination of the UN Assembly. It is necessary to hold a ceasefire."
"By the UN Secretary General's statement that at present, Syria is hell on earth, we can only imagine the situation there. During the past week, it was reported that more than 600 civilians were killed. Thousands of women and children were massacred in the internal war. Parties responsible should end the needless bloodshed of innocent people. It is time to come to a mutual understanding."
"The UN has to consider this situation as a serious and urgent matter, at the currently ongoing Human Rights Commissions session. The Human Rights Commission has a responsibility to bring about a ceasefire among the relevant parties. "On behalf of all Sri Lankan Muslims, I condemn the ongoing onslaught and appeal to the UN and the world to support Syria in this time of need."

ICTA sources also concur lead generation has yielded an estimated conservative cumulative sales pipeline of over AUD 2,750,000 post-missions that took place during the last two years alone, while the total value for overall missions are much higher.
Not only have these missions contributed to boosting Sri Lankas export earnings but helped generate more employment opportunities for local tech professionals creating new jobs. The ICTA-led missions to Australia have also helped yield a vote of confidence of our innovative and tech savvy companies.

Illegal tapping amidst water scarcity in Anuradhapura
Although several intermittent gusts have been experienced in the Anuradhapura district, no sufficient amount of water had accumulated in the 12 major and 85 medium tanks. According to statistics from the Anuradhapura Zonal Irrigation Director's Office, the water capacity of the Hurulu Wewa remains at 7,000 acre-feet, whereas the normal capacity is 85,000 acre-feet. The water levels of the Nuwara Wewa, Tisa Wewa and Mahakanadawara, Mahavilachchiya, Wahalkada, Nachchaduwa tanks are low; below 50 percent at present.
It was reported that amidst the water scarcity, certain farmers are attempting to illegally obtain water from the tanks, breaching the water-management criteria agreed upon at the kanna meetings.
A group of farmers cultivating under the Heen Ela canal of the Nachchaduwa reservoir, was reported to have broken the padlocks of regulators at four distribution canals in order to obtain water for their paddy fields. Also, at night on the same day, certain paddy cultivators had broken the locks of the main sluice of the Heen Ela canal, causing a large-scale water wastage. Nachchaduwa irrigation Engineer Amal Bandara told the Daily News that culprits were not arrested, despite three complaints concerning these criminal acts being reported to Hidogama Police.
"At present, we have tightened our night patrol with irrigation officers and farmer organisation members having joined together to thwart the vandals, since police are not cooperating. If these acts of vandalism continue, we will be at a great loss of water, which would adversely affect the limited Maha paddy cultivation in 44,000 acres under Nachchaduwa Maha Ela canal," Irrigation Engineer Amal Bandara said.
It was learnt that water is being illegally tapped at the main feeding canals of the Nuwara Wewa, Tisa Wewa and Hurulu Wewa tanks, and farmer organisations have urged the Anuradhapura government agent and the zonal irrigation director to take the necessary security measures to put an end to such illegal activities.
In the meantime, the Mahaweli water issued to Hurulu Wewa by the Mahaweli Authority from Bowathenna, is about to be halted at the Hiriwadunna, Habarana, and Thalkote tanks, preventing a large volume of water to flow into Hurulu Wewa through these tanks along the 60-km long feeding canal.
Hurulu Wewa Irrigation Engineer Athula Wijewardhana told the Daily News that Mahaweli water flowing along the feeding canal is being illegally tapped up to 20 km from the Lenadora area by tourist hotel owners and large-scale paddy and additional crop cultivators. Due to this prevailing situation, Hurulu Wewa farmers have been suffering in every cultivation season, being deprived of cultivating the full acreage of 15,000 acres. Wijewardhana said he, along with the Hurulu Wewa farmers, have urged authorities to take permanent action to prevent this vandalism.
According to the agreement with the Mahaweli Authority, the annual intake of Mahaweli water to Hurulu Wewa is 20,000 acre-feet, he added.

People were not attacked, but their properties were destroyed along with a mosque, the Minister said, referring to the unrest on February 27. The result is that fear gripped the Muslim populace here. Therefore the IRPC is important, and it needs to be formulated immediately with your leadership. We shall extend our fullest cooperation, Minister Bathiudeen said.
A mosque, a lodging place adjoining the mosque, several small shops close to the mosque, a street-side hotel, and several vehicles were set on fire by a group of men in the early hours of February 27, after an argument erupted between some men and the owner of a street-side hotel in Ampara town.
On February 27, the Minister severely condemned the attack that took place in Ampara town targeting a mosque and several businesses. During the Cabinet meeting on that day, he called on the government to take immediate and strict action against the wrongdoers, saying that the government should compensate people for the losses. During his visit to Ampara, Minister Bathiudeen also met affected people in the town and had discussions with them, assuring them that the new committee will come into effect soon to safeguard them.

Kala Pola; elevating Sri Lankan artists
Kala Pola was inspired by world famous out-door art fairs like the Montmartre in Paris and the Turl Street Art Festival in Oxford. Within just a couple of years, it was being regarded as an important art event and a highlight on the Sri Lankan art calendar.
The John Keells Group began its association as the sponsor and organizer of Kala Pola in 1994 and has done so every year since with the guidance of The George Keyt Foundation.
Each year the fair has grown to include more artists, attract more visitors and occupy more space on Ananda Coomaraswamy Mawatha. The fact that the street that hosts it has now turned into a permanent art market all year round is the greatest testament to the impact Kala Pola has had.
The 25th edition of Kala Pola was held recently with the participation of High Commissioner of India to Sri Lanka, Taranjit Singh Sandhu as the Chief Guest. Over 300 local painters and sculptors participated at this year's event which featured portrait sketching, cultural entertainment and a kid's art corner.

Kindling the artist in every child
The word, innovation is vastly used in the modern world, may it be in the business sector, corporate sector or in the art sphere. Innovators emerge via freedom of thought, freedom of expression and by engaging in joyful creative activity, a process that is followed from the childhood without hindrances. Rabindranath Tagore, in his autobiography says, freedom he was given as a child, made him the thinker he became.
Late Cora Abraham, who firmly believed in this philosophy, pioneered Melbourne Art Classes in 1949 which became Cora Abraham Art Classes after her demise in 1979.
Cora Abraham Art Classes, now held at a quiet and green environment in Thimbirigasyaya, Colombo are for children with or without inborn artistic talents, who yearn for freedom of expression.
The present Chairperson of the entity, Chandramani Thenuwara is a well versed academic with a great philosophy in life and beyond. She is assisted by the Principal of the school, Nirmala Riza.
Thenuwara said, late Cora Abraham was not only an artist but a super teacher who would encourage students to be self-confident. Her objective had been to make a breed of sensitive and self confident children who will become prudent adults.
Cora Abraham wanted to offer little children with time and space to enjoy creative activity with the least amount of instructions. Her motto was that, we must not destroy the integrated world the little child strives to build up in his own mind, said Thenuwara.
The Cora Abraham Art class caters to children of all ages, all ethnic groups including the differently-abled.
The entity has a scholarship programme to finance children of not-well-to-do families to attend the classes as well.
Sri Lanka is a beautiful country with diverse religions. We encourage children to respond to every religious festival in town and bring out the beauty and significance of them, said the Principal, Nirmala Riza.
She also said the annual exhibition of the school has a Festival Corner where all the works of children on festivals are exhibited.
Cora Abraham art classes conduct a six-month intensive teacher-training programme for which, teachers of Colombo schools attend. We want them to take the Cora Abraham message to their schools, said Riza.
We call our method, expression through art hence the value of a particular picture is when the child has expressed himself freely. Children must be sensitive to the beauty around them and also to tragedies, people, animals and the environment. Our teachers are trained towards fulfilling this somewhat unusual objective and schools that value our service invite us to educate their Art teachers and conduct programmes for children, said the Chairperson.
The teachers would share diverse experiences with children they have constantly. Once a child who had drawn a green elephant had told the teachers, he had seen such a picture displaced on a roadside billboard.
Cora Abraham art class does not have art competitions and neither does it conduct exams to judge the ability of children to draw. A child sees the world differently from the way he draws hence it is ridiculous to grade talent.
Judging is very damaging for a child because if his picture is selected as the best one in a competition, he may think he is greater than his peers, said the Chairperson. She urged the parents to refrain from imposing sophisticated ideas on their children.
Do not let computers and phones dominate children. Personalities developed via freedom of thought and creative activity sheds light on emergence of flexible individuals and good leaders, she stressed.

Lasantha Wickrematunge assassination: CID could have arrested me in 2015  former IGP
Former IGP Jayantha Wickramaratne said he had made a statement to the Criminal Investigations Department (CID) in 2015 with regard to journalist Lasantha Wickrematunges killing and if the CID thought that he (IGP) done something wrong, they could have arrested him then.
He said this in response to a query made by our sister paper Dinamina as to why he had petitioned the court seeking a court order preventing his possible arrest in connection with the murder of Wickrematunge.
I was the IG at the time of Lasantha Wickrematunges murder and the investigations pertaining to the killing were handled by the Mount Lavinia Police, the former IGP said. When information we had suggested that there was a military involvement in the killing, I handed the case over to the CID, with the intention that the investigations could be conducted more precisely. The incident took place on January 08, 2009, and while the investigations were progressing under the CID, I retired from the police in June that year, having completed my time. Thereafter Mahinda Balasooriya was appointed as the IG and I dont know why he handed over the investigations on Lasanthas killing to the TID [Terrorist Investigation Division].
Meanwhile, having taken over the investigations once again two years ago after the yahapalanaya government came into power, many files similar to those that were reported missing in the investigations relating to the murder of Sunday Leader Editor Lasantha Wickrematunge, had been discovered in the house of the former Acting Crimes OIC of the Mount Lavinia Police, according to CID sources. The CID had also found several forged documents at the arrested Acting Crimes OIC, SI Sugathapalas residence.
The former Acting Crimes OIC of Mount Lavinia Police was arrested and remanded on February 2.
However, during the CID interrogation of the Mount Lavinia Acting Crimes OIC, he had not divulged any information regarding the documents that were at his residence. During the interrogation, when the former OIC had been given a break for lunch, under the custody of another officer, he had managed to escape. Upon investigating the two addresses given by Sugathapala, his address was found with the assistance of the Kalutara Police. It was there that the CID had found the missing and forged documents.
Retired Senior DIG Prasanna Nanayakkara was also arrested by the CID on February 14 for allegedly having concealing evidence in the murder of Wickrematunge.
Nanayakkara was the Senior DIG in charge of the Western Province at the time of Wickrematunges murder, while Mount Lavinia was under his jurisdiction.
Lasantha Wickrematunge, was murdered on January 08, 2009, in Attidiya, Ratmalana, while on his way to the office.
The CID said further information gathered through the investigations is expected to be produced before courts in the future.

Shout HOW!
How! I shouted.
It means good!
How means good in Chinese I asked with a smile.
The young man smiled and nodded and we both went back to watching the program.
He was Song Yumin, the Deputy Consul General of China and what we were watching was a staged Chinese Wedding, enacted by members of the embassy staff.
How! I shouted.
Good! shouted Song.
I watched enthralled as the group sang and danced and showed us Chinese customs we knew nothing about. Till today all I knew about China, was the Made in China label that was part of most products in the market and the Chinese food I loved.
I had walked down Canal Street in New York and had even gone into the numerous Chinese stores there but had never really tried to get to know the people.
Today I realized they were warm, spontaneous, fun loving people like the rest in the audience.
How! I shouted again.
Good! smiled my new friend Song Yumin.
At the final dinner of an International conference, an American delegate turned to a Chinese delegate sitting next to him and pointing to the soup asked, somewhat condescendingly, Likeesoupee The Chinese gentleman nodded eagerly.
A little later, it was Likeefishee and Likeemeatee and Likeefruitee  and always the response was an affable nod.
At the end of the dinner the chairman of the conference introduced the guest speaker of the evening  none other than the Chinese gentleman who went up to the podium and delivered a penetrating, witty discourse in impeccable English much to the astonishment of his American neighbor.
When the speech was over, the speaker turned to his neighbor and with a mischievous twinkle in his eye, asked, Likeespeechee
If we want to be part of the great global village the world is becoming, then we need to start getting to know people from all over the world, otherwise well be made fools off like what happened to the American. We need to lose our prejudices and start realizing others are as cultured, educated and wonderful people as we are.
Weve always thought of Tibetans in our country as people who turn up during winter to sell warm clothing. We listen to their strange dialect as we haggle over prices then go away. But did you know they are a warm, loving people
There is this charming tale of a practice by Tibetan monks, who when they looked out of their monasteries in the mountains and saw stormy weather, would cut out paper horses and taking them to the roof, would stand in the cold and release them into the wind, with an appropriate prayer that they might be changed into real horses and carry distressed travelers to safety!
The Chinese wedding had ended. HOW! I shouted and felt a new warmth for these wonderful people who had opened my closed mind..!

Lotus Tower  to open soon
The much awaited and long overdue Lotus Tower (Nelum Kuluna) is scheduled to open in May/June this year adding another icon to the island nation.
Over 96% of construction has now been completed. Built with an investment of US$ 104.3 million and funded by Chinese EXIM bank, the tower would firstly offer facilities to enhance the digital infrastructure of Sri Lanka. Standing at over 350 meters tall making it the worlds 19th tallest tower it would also serve as a major tourist attraction. This incidentally would also be the tallest structure in the entire SAARC region, said, Prof. Nimal De Silva, Senior Engineer of the Lotus Tower project.
The first and second floors of the tower, located at 215 meters and 219.8 meters, are to be used for TV and radio broadcasting.The tower will be able to accommodate, 50 radio broadcasters, 20 telecommunication service providers and 50 television broadcasters. At a guided tower of the Lotus Tower, Chanaka Abeykoon, Administration Manager, Lotus Tower projec said it will also offer two banquet/conference halls in two floors to accommodate nearly 450 guests on each floor. In addition there would be several VIP rooms as well and a special area to view Colombo city and the pending Colombo Port City project. However the major draw would be the revolving restaurant on the top floor which would do one round in 90 minutes.
The seven acre land where Nelum Kuluna is housed also has several other recreation facilities.
Currently nearly 500 are working with a ratio of 30 (Sri Lankan) to 70 (Chinese). The Telecommunications Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka (TRCSL) would be handling the administration of the project while the Moratuwa University is handling, overseeing the construction.
The foundation stone was laid on January 20, 2012 for the USD104.3 million Lotus Tower project. Though the Lotus Tower is set to open in a few weeks the public as well as the private sector has not been given a thorough knowledge of its facilities. It was observed that two floors have being allocated for shopping malls with several escalator access but shopping spaces are yet to be tendered. Similarly marketing is yet to start for its large conference and banquet facilities.

Meghan Markle will never become the 'People's Princess'
His biography of Princess Diana took the world by storm in 1992 after he published details of her mental health battle and heartache over Camilla.
And Andrew Morton, 64, has now weighed in on the world's newest royal-to-be Meghan Markle, claiming that she will never replace Diana as the 'People's Princess'.
'The mass media has been looking for a golden goose and Diana died,' Andrew told The Morning Show's Kylie Gillies and Larry Emdur this Wednesday.
'They thought at first it would be Kate, and to a degree it was. And now it is Meghan. I'm afraid to say, folks, there is only one Diana and sadly, she has passed,' he went on. Andrew, who recently announced his plans to pen a tell-all biography about Meghan Markle, also claimed that Diana would have approved of Harry's bride.
'I think she would have been very impressed by Meghan. She was someone who always had ambitions to be a speech maker and Meghan spoke at the UN Women's conference. She is very fluent and articulate.'
'She has elements that Diana always wanted to be, and she is also someone like Diana who wants to give back, who wants to get involved with the community and articulating some of the issues that we'd rather not talk about.' In December last year, Andrew sent tongues wagging after he Tweeted about Meghan's biography, writing: 'Excited to be writing Meghan Markle's story. She has bags of charisma. A royal star who will have tremendous impact on royal family and wider world.' According to The Bookseller, Meghan: A Hollywood Princess, will be published on April 19, 2018, a month before the former Suits star weds Prince Harry at Windsor Castle. There is no suggestion, however, that Meghan has co-operated in any way with Morton's latest book.
Andrew wrote international bestseller Diana: Her True Story in 1992 as well as a revised edition after her death based on taped responses from Diana to his written questions.
Those recordings, about seven hours of taped responses, were secretly made in Kensington Palace in 1991 during a series of interviews conducted through an intermediary, Dr James Colthurst.

MP Rahuman calls on Govt. to root out extremist elements
UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman called on the Yahapalana Government to make good on its promises to root out extremist elements, adding that continuing impunity will pave the way for continued violence.
Addressing a press briefing in Colombo, Rahuman added that continuing impunity coupled with the lack of political will serve as incubators for continued violence.
It doesnt matter if these acts of violence are perpetrated against Muslims, Tamils or Sinhalese, what matters is action being taken on the part of law enforcement authorities, a probe that will see perpetrators being brought to book and political will to ensure it doesnt happen again, he said.
He added that if there isnt political will to tackle the root cause of the issues, a regime change will have no impact. We keep chasing after crooks and criminals but we dont heed to simmering racial tensions, he said.
We came to power on the premise that we would weed out such elements or take action against them, its high time we make good on those promises,MP Rahuman said. He further said he has made a personal request to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to initiate a probe into the tensions that flared in Ampara which took place two days after the Premier assumed duties as Minister of Law and Order.
Ampara is not known to be a place that is prone to such extremism, he said.
Communities have been peacefully coexisting for years and if elements can run riot in a place like that, one needs to question if we are doing enough, MP Rahuman added.

Old car park turns into an underground farm
This is La Caverne, an old car park in Paris transformed into an underground farm! It is the French startup Cycloponics, launched by Thophile Champagnat and Jean-Nol Gertz, who had the idea to recycle these huge empty spaces to create a mushroom in the heart of Paris, Porte de la Chapelle. La Caverne is an urban and underground farm of more than 3500 m!
La Caverne is the first organic farm in Paris, capable of producing mushrooms, endives, oyster mushrooms, shiitakes and young plants, and of course without GMO, without pesticides, and certified organic farming! This is an awesome concept that allows them to deliver by bike fresh products, harvested the same day, to many restaurants. More information is available on the website of La Caverne. Ufunk

Rajanganaya Farmer Association President arrested: Drinking water project halted for now
Rajanganaya Unified Farmers Association President Nihal Wanniarachchi had been arrested by the Police yesterday over the unrest in the Thambuttegama town on Wednesday. A tense situation prevailed in the Thambuttegama town as police fired teargas and water cannons to disperse a group of protesters who were blocking the Kurunegala- Anuradhapura main road and pelting stones at the Thambuttegama Police Station on Wednesday.
The protest had been reportedly organised by Wanniarachchis organisation over a drinking water project in the area.
Meanwhile, Anuradhapura District Secretary R.M.Wanninayake told journalists yesterday that the Rajanganaya drinking water project has been temporarily halted.
Wanninayake said the farmers have been misled and there was no basis to the fears expressed by them that the drinking water project, will adversely affect their farming activities because the water is taken from the Rajanganaya tank.
Wanninayake stressed that the water released for cultivations will not be affected due to the drinking water project.
The Government Agent said the project had been approved by the Cabinet as far back as 2011 and it was been done with the support of the Water Supply and Drainage Board and the Irrigation Department to supply drinking water to people in and around Thambuttegama town.
The police on Wednesday arrested nearly 60 people for disobeying a court order and protesting.

We expect to give appointments to 400 primary school dancing teachers. Dancing teachers who came from other provinces will be released after these appointments, he added.
We plan to recruit teachers for Mathematics, Science, Information Technology, Economics, and commerce. We will arrange an entrance examination for teachers. We intend to conduct an examination especially for English language teachers. Any graduate or diploma holder can apply. We hope to enroll them in training teacher training colleges, he said.

Sri Lankas 70th Independence Day celebrated in Australia
The 70th Independence Day of Sri Lanka was celebrated by the Sri Lankan Consulate General in Sydney, Australia, on February 5, at the Sydney University Great Hall.
The event commenced with a reception held on the north lawn adjoining the university great hall, where over 400 guests were treated to Sri Lankan food.
The evenings proceedings commenced with the singing of the Sri Lankan national anthem, followed by the Australian national anthem. The traditional oil lamp was lit by Australian Parliament Secretary to the Premier and New South Wales Multiculturalism and Disability Services Minister Scott Farlow, Sri Lankan High Commissioner to Australia Somasundaram Skandakumar, Foreign Affairs and Trade Department (DFAT) New South Wales State Office Director Rhonda Piggott and Diplomatic Corps Dean Jane Louise Connolly, representing the 16 Consuls General accredited to New South Wales and other invited high-profile dignitaries.
Religious blessings were performed by Australian Siamese Sect Malwatta Chapter Chief Prelate Ven. Pundit Meegahakumbure Dhammagavesi Thera, Rev. Father Chaminda Wanigasekera, Ubaidur Rahman Mahmood, and Kurukkal Arumugam Iyer.
Two minutes of silence were observed to commemorate all who sacrificed their lives while serving the nation. A message from the President was read by Consul (Commercial) M. M. Abdul Raheem. The consul general welcomed the invited guests who included New South Wales Parliament members, consuls general accredited to New South Wales, friends of Sri Lanka, and expatriate Sri Lankans.
Consul General Raheem expressed his praised Sri Lankan expatriate community, most of them consisting of professionals in wide and varied disciplines performing at high levels, apart from blending with the community at large, as expressed time and again by Australian government authorities. He also welcomed the spirit of reconciliation shown by the different ethnic groups of Sri Lankan origin in New South Wales and Queensland and urged them to move beyond by sharing their professional experiences and knowledge with their Sri Lankan counterparts.
High Commissioner Somasundaram Skandakumar in his address, agreed with Consul General Raheem and added that Sri Lanka has had many achievements as well as setbacks since independence, and it was time for all Sri Lankans to reach their true potential and the nation itself to move towards a highly-developed country. He said all should be treated equally, and with equal opportunity Sri Lanka would develop. Sri Lanka, gifted with many resources, is expected to grow, now that reconciliation and unity is at the forefront of governance.
Parliament Secretary to the Premier Scott Farlow said he has had great connections with expatriate Sri Lankans since his school days, and regarded them as intelligent people who have contributed towards the development of Australia. He congratulated Sri Lanka on reaching 70 years of independence and wished the people more strength and courage in their journey forward.
DFAT State Director Rhonda Piggott congratulated Sri Lanka on achieving this milestone and recounted people-to-people friendship and collaborations in the fields of commerce, agriculture, education, and border-protection amongst cultural and sporting ties to be the highlights of the two countries.
Keynote Speaker Dr. Siran Deraniyagala shared his knowledge in the field of archaeology and Sri Lankan pre-history through a detailed PowerPoint presentation.
Soon after the speech by Dr. Deraniyagala, a song from the Sinhala Movie Hithaka Pipuna Mal; lyrics by Fr. Marcelline Jayakody, music by Dr. Shelton Premaratne, and reproduced by Mr. Agra Premaratne; was harmonised by Ishi Yogya and Their Kulatilake. The song was followed by a dance choreographed and presented by Anandavalli of the Lingalayam Dance Company, and three girls performing to Danno Budunge, which was sung by Voice Print who were flown in courtesy of SriLankan Airlines to perform at this event.

Sri Lankas evolving legal landscape set for analysis in 2018 report
Sri Lankas efforts to create a more consistent legal framework, as part of a broader bid to boost foreign direct investment, will be explored in a report due out in the coming months by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 will shine a spotlight on the countrys latest legislative developments, which include the implementation of the Inland Revenue Act and the Foreign Exchange Act.
OBGs publication will also consider other legal reforms that could be on the horizon, such as possible changes to the countrys immigration laws covering the requirements of foreign nationals wishing to work in Sri Lanka.
John Wilson Partners has signed a third memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the firm will assist in the research for the Law Chapter of The Report: Sri Lanka 2018.
John Wilson, managing partner at the law firm, said he welcomed the opportunity to work with OBGs team once again and describe to OBGs readership the positive changes and legal reforms taking place in the country.
While there are still remains a lot to be done in terms of reforms to Sri Lankas legal framework, business leaders considering the country as a potential investment destination will undoubtedly have questions relating to the current reforms, new laws and their application, he said. I am pleased to have been able to analyse these developments for Oxford Business Groups readers and provide key insights to navigate their way through this evolving legislative landscape.
Welcoming John Wilson Partners on board, OBGs editorial manager in Sri Lanka, Michael Todemann, added that although Sri Lanka offered plenty of openings across its economy, inconsistencies in its legal framework had, at times, deterred investors.
While there is still more to be done, new laws and others in the pipeline are important signs of progress, he said. John Wilson Partners are known to be local experts in their field, with an in-depth knowledge of Sri Lankas legal environment. Im delighted that by establishing a long-term relationship with its team, we will continue to benefit from their input in this important part of our research.

Sri Lanka Tourism commemorates International Womens Day
Sri Lanka Tourism commemorated International Women's Day for the very first time by organizing a panel discussion on women in tourism at the SLITHM Auditorium. The welcome address was delivered by Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs John Amaratunga while the keynote address was delivered by Mayor elect of Colombo, Rosy Senanayake. The main panelists were: Buddhika Hewawasam, Director General, Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management, Rookamanie Fernando, General Manager, Jetwing Colombo 7, Kasun Abeynayaka, Academic and Consultant, William Angliss Institute, Carmen Niethammer, Program Manager, IFC Women in Work Program.
The discussion was moderated by Anishka de Zylva, Research Associate, Lakshman Kadirgamar Institute. Vote of thanks was delivered by Director Marketing, SLTPB, Madhubani Perera.
Minister of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs, John Amaratunga said, "Im pleased to be here this evening at the very first Womens Day Celebration organized by the Ministry of Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs. I must thank all the organisers for taking this initiative which has been long overdue."
"Today women form the majority of the population in Sri Lanka with around 10.9 million females as opposed to 10.1 million males. Even in our own work places here,I believe women are in the majority. Therefore this celebration today is a milestone in highlighting the equitable position of women in general and in tourism in particular," the minister said. "Sri Lanka is also one of the few countries in the world to have established a dedicated Ministry of Womens Affairs almost 4 decades ago with the mandate to ensure the well-being of all females living in this country. Ministry of Tourism will focus on encouraging more women to join the lucrative tourism industry which has the potential to transform the economy of our country through greater female participation," the minister said.
"In conclusion I take this opportunity to once again thank the organisers for organizing this important event and I also hope that more females will contribute to economic activity especially the tourism sector which will help take our country to greater heights."

Swimmer, 99, 'breaks world record' in Australia

A 99-year-old Australian swimmer appears to have smashed a world record for his age group in the 50m freestyle.
George Corones clocked 56.12 seconds at an official event in Queensland - a new benchmark for the 100-104 age category.
He eclipsed the previous mark, set in 2014, by 35 seconds. It will now be verified by the sport's governing body.
Corones, who is eligible for the record because he turns 100 in April, said he was "quite delighted" and "over the world" by the result.
"It was an exemplary swim for me, well balanced... and I was ready to hit the [wall] at the end very hard with my hand," he said.
He said he had been overwhelmed by the "roaring" crowd on the Gold Coast on Wednesday. The event, in which he was the sole entrant, had been specifically staged for him to challenge the record.
"We have just witnessed history in the making!" the Australian Dolphins swim team said on its Facebook page.
'It takes a while to get going'
Corones, from Brisbane, said he was a keen swimmer in his youth but only began swimming again aged 80.
"I gave it up at the beginning of the war [World War Two], and I don't think I had a swim of any description until I retired," he said.
"I started swimming again for exercise."
He said racing "undeniably" challenged him physically, but it was manageable with preparation. On average he swims laps three times a week, and also fits in gym sessions.
"At this age it takes a while to get going... you get exhausted much more easily, but if you do it sensibly, the rewards are astronomical," he said.
He attributed his success to his pacing and technique.
"My first dozen strokes were well balanced and the trick is to just carry it on progressively, putting a little bit of increasing effort in each stroke," he said.
"I did that until the last 10m - I knew I was tired and done - but went on without any disturbance."
The previous record of 1:31.19was set by British swimmer John Harrison in 2014.
Corones's race took place just before the Australian Swimming Trials for the Commonwealth Games, which will begin on the Gold Coast next month.
Masters Swimming Australia said the record was pending official verification by the International Swimming Federation (Fina).
Corones will challenge the 100m freestyle record on Saturday night, believing he can beat the current mark of 03:23.10, which was also set by Harrison.
"I'm not a young man by any means, but I am really looking forward to it and confident I can do very well," he said.

Thambuttegama drinking water project halted after protest
Anuradhapura District Secretary R. M. Wanninayake said yesterday that a decision has been taken to temporarily suspend the drinking water supplying project in Thambuttegama, following the protest held by farmers in the area on Wednesday.
He was addressing a meeting held between protestors and Irrigation Department and National Water Supply and Drainage Board (NWSDB) officers on Wednesday. Wanninayake said this project aimed at providing clean water to the people in the area started on a Cabinet decision in 2011, with financial assistance from the Chinese government. The government of China has extended financial assistance to the tune of Rs. 17 million for the project.
"We will not take any decision to resume this project without consulting farmer representatives and agriculture and irrigation department officials. No one is selling water to any organisation or company," Government Agent Wanninayake said.
National Water Supply and Drainage Board officials said this project was implemented with bona fide intentions of providing clean, potable water to the people in the area where high prevalence of chronic kidney diseases were reported, the government agent added.
Officials said that farmers staged a protest without having a clear understanding of the project, and damaged public property. The farmers had thought that the water provided to agriculture purposes would be curtailed due to this project.

Tourism Ministry to accredit tuk tuk drivers
In an attempt to rein in Sri Lankas virtually unregulated tuk tuk industry, the Tourism Ministry is trying to create an accreditation for trained drivers.
On Thursday and Friday, about 100 drivers from the Colombo area are attending workshops held by the Sri Lanka Tourist Three Wheeler Drivers Association, which is supported by the Tourism Ministry. Most of the complaints we receive against tuk tuk drivers are related to high charges, and cheating, said Chief Inspector Prabath Vidanagama, OIC, Tourist Police Division.
But theres no regulatory mechanism in this field, he said. So we are organizing a team, especially in the Colombo area, to combat this.
Drivers went to seminars hosted at the Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hospitality Management, on topics like the history of Sri Lankan culture, interactions with police, basic language skills, and first aid. Once we take them into our framework, then they are always with us, said OIC Vidanagama. If they want to keep the accreditation, they must follow the regulations.
Vidanagama said the first 100 drivers will receive a sticker with a logo showing they are certified by the tourism ministry. The logo will be prominently displayed at Bandaranaike International Airport so tourists know to look for it.
Tuk tuks offer a very important service to tourists in Sri Lanka, said Tourism Minister John Amaratunga, addressing the drivers yesterday. This is a comprehensive measure by tourism authorities to address the problems in a sustainable way. Rohan, a tuk tuk driver who said he mainly works in the Colombo Fort area, said bad experiences with drivers leads some tourists to avoid tuk tuks altogether.
But some of us are working honestly, he said. He said he hopes the ministry accreditation will support the business of drivers like him.

## Title: Triumph of democracy
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Friday, March 2, 2018 - 01:00
Triumph of democracy
Never a dull moment, is a characteristic feature of Sri Lankan politics. Though the atmosphere is lively, there are certain disturbing trends visible in the horizon - trends trivial, apparently trivial and not so trivial. Let us glance at some of them.
In the aftermath of the local government elections many politicians including the former President Rajapaksa MP and certain ministers of the Government have cast doubts about the feasibility of the new electoral system (though it was a product of consensus by all parties) under which the February 10th election was conducted. Some have even called for the restoration of the former system with all its ugly features including the preferential or the manape vote.
As noted in this column the merits and demerits of the new system could be clearly seen only in practice. Of merits we have spoken earlier. Most deficiencies relate to the nature of the representation. Complaints are many.
One is that those who have won a majority at the ward level have been ignored in deciding upon the membership in Councils. Another is the imbroglio regarding women representation with certain Councils lacking adequate or any representation. There are also certain disproportions in representation if average percentage votes received by elected members are considered. Some of these, for example the last factor are due to the unequal size of the electoral constituencies and the density of voters in each.
Women representation
The imbroglio over women representation is as much the result of patriarchal social relations in which the women are still confined to the kitchen, especially in matters such as politics as well as in other factors. Political parties, unlike their counterparts in developed countries are male dominated bastions.
Though the huge electoral victory of the SLPP is claimed as a triumph of democracy it is actually a result of an aberration or a perversion of democracy at the ground level. Local government elections are meant to establish democracy in the third tier of governance. Local affairs and local development are the subjects to be undertaken by the elected members.
Almost all political parties that contested the election ignored this basic fact and converted the election into a referendum on the performance of the central Government. The latter also colluded in this exercise with calling the voters to vote in the name of the President or the Prime Minister. Ultimately the election turned out to be one among three personalities- the President, the former President and the Prime Minister. People voted for the former President taking him to be a Messiah who would deliver the country and people from all their woes.
In their allegiance to the messiah, voters have disregarded the qualifications of candidates who aspired for office. Instances are not few where they have elected known criminals or those indicted with criminal charges in Courts of Law, among other disqualifications. Some elected members have been taken into custody for various offences committed after being elected. The biggest joke is recorded from the fairly literate Maharagama Council where a disparate independent group was elected in the name of the messiah claiming victory in their own right and quite legitimately refusing to bow down before the Lotus Bud.
Political and socio-economic issues
The whole election has been an exercise in which the voters were distracted from weighing issues of competence and suitability of individual contestants for assuming responsibilities of managing local political and socio-economic issues.
Naturally the new electoral system needs revision and the experience of the last election would be much useful in doing so. Whatever its defects, it is a step towards greater democracy considering the abolition of the absurd manape vote and the introduction of a quota for women representation. To reject the new system would be like throwing the baby too with the soiled waters of the bath tub.
Everybody is agreed that the voters have given a stern warning to the Government to mend its ways or get out. The President and the Prime Minister too agree. However, whether they will mend their ways or have already done so is not yet apparent.
Much was promised and much was expected from the radical Cabinet reshuffle. The latter, delivered only partially after a full months labour does not give any confidence to the public. It is the same old dramatis personae on stage with minor changes in roles and attire. No new faces, no young blood taking over from the conservative old guard. No new policies either. Adding insult to injury we have been asked to wait for another fortnight (which may turn out to be even a month according to the velocity of changes taking place) for the consummation of change.
Nothing short of a concrete and realistic action plan to fast-track economic and social development and necessary institutional and administrative reforms to carry it out would satisfy the public. Already a month has elapsed after the elections and still the government is reeling from the shock received.
Before everything else the government must discipline the Cabinet of Ministers. When ministers are at the throat of one another and disunity and feud prevails nothing could be done successfully. Repercussions would be seen in the economy. Investors would hesitate to come. Capital flight would take place, etc.
A radical change would necessitate the ending of waste and corruption so prevalent in the public sector. All extravagant expenses have to be pruned. This includes the down-sizing of the Jumbo Cabinet without the pretext of a national Government. The latter provision is a convenient phrase to placate political party interests to the detriment of national interest.
Whether one acknowledges it or not, crisis looms large in the economy, especially in view of increased debt payments, diminishing foreign job opportunities for Sri Lankans in the Gulf States, depreciation of the Rupee and possible worsening balance of payments. Actually extra-ordinary measures will have to be taken if the Government is to deliver on its promises within the next two years.
Constitutional reforms
Three years have been wasted by the ruling parties in inter-party and intra-party struggles for power that they gave preference to the party before the country, its people and their problems. Open revolt inside the SLFP has been tolerated until the rebels formed her own political party and successfully replaced the parent party. To the dismay of its well-wishers the SLFP still engages in talks with the SLPP with a view of achieving unity despite the differences in policy the latter has with the January 8th policies pledged by the President. How could the President reconcile his unremitting struggle against corruption in unison with allegedly corrupt elements in the SLPP
Constitutional reforms have been relegated to the background. Of course, the possibility of the Constitutional reform exercise being harmed by the acrimony that would develop during the election campaign could have been seen by the President and the Prime Minister before setting the agenda. If the elections were held earlier the Constitutional exercise could have been begun with a fresh bid for unity. Or else the other way about could have been taken. Such lack of foresight is unpardonable.
The usual tunes are being played again. There is much talk of the need for bitter medicine. The problem is not taking bitter medicine but how to select those that need the medicine. It cannot be a purgative that could even kill the patient, if to paraphrase a local idiom.
Deplorable is the hunt for publicity and ego building of politicians at public expense. Their daily routine includes a considerable time in various functions such as opening of bridges, culverts and other public utilities. Such jobs could be undertaken by officials at best and politicians should devote most of their times in the formulation and supervision of matters of policy.

Reports confirmed that this team of undergraduates who were on a camping tour, while trekking the mountains, were reportedly caught in a heavy downpour and lost their way as dusk was fast-falling amid the inclement weather.
Haldummulla Police, on receiving a call for rescue assistance, an 11-member rescue team of the SFHQ-Cen on the directions of Security Forces - Central (SF-Cen) Commander Major General Rukmal Dias was dispatched to the jungle, although torrential rains obstructed their search operations. The search operation lasted around five hours.
The rescue team waited until first light and handed over the undergraduates to Haldummulla Police at 10.30 a.m.

US keen to boost trade ties with Sri Lanka
The US Department of Commerces Advocacy Center Director Stephen Renna met with government leaders and US companies in Colombo recently, to discuss opportunities to increase US exports to Sri Lanka.
The United States is eager to expand open, fair and reciprocal trade, said Renna during his visit.
American companies are some of the most dependable business partners anywhere in the world, a statement from the US Embassy in Colombo, said.
US companies produce the highest quality goods and services with the highest standards for ethics, corporate social responsibility, employee benefits, and environmental awareness, said US Ambassador Atul Keshap.
Further, when selling goods and services to foreign governments, the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act makes it unlawful for US firms and American citizens to pay bribes or otherwise violate the law. The values, practices, and international standards that American companies bring to the table make them the finest partners for improving standards and quality throughout business ecosystems, the statement said.
Trade and investment are the engines of growth and employment, and the United States is Sri Lankas largest trading partner, purchasing around US$ 2.9 billion (Rs. 445 billion) in Sri Lankan goods in 2017, sustaining tens of thousands of jobs in Sri Lanka.
Those exports not only create employment, they also bring nearly US$ 7 million per day of hard currency into Sri Lanka, hard currency the Sri Lankan economy relies upon to lubricate the gears of commerce. Last year, the United States exported US$ 337 million of goods to Sri Lanka. There is tremendous opportunity for that figure to grow. American firms provide Sri Lanka with top quality, fair and reliable solutions that Sri Lanka needs to expand transportation infrastructure, improve agricultural output, attract more tourists, and provide and improve services for its citizens.
The US Embassys economic and commercial team is available to help Sri Lankan companies do business with the United States, and can be reached via [emailprotected], the statement said.

Womans accent changes overnight!
A former American beauty queen has been accused of sounding like a Spice Girl, after waking up with an Irish accent, that quickly morphed into English - despite having never left the USA.
Michelle Myers accent is now so strong that her daughter Rose, 16, calls her mummy, rather than the US version, mommy - leading people to think she has been raised abroad.
Michelle, 45, a mum-of-seven, was diagnosed with foreign accent syndrome in 2015 - a rare condition causing sufferers to talk with a foreign intonation, while still speaking their native language. Id had a splitting headache and when I woke up, my voice was that of a completely different person, Michelle said.
I found it really difficult to begin with and people would think it was a joke - saying things like, You sound like a Spice Girl, or, Are you Mary Poppins It was hard, because I was really struggling.
I have come to terms with the fact I might sound like this forever. I realise its part of me now.
Now an author and public speaker, Michelle, of Phoenix, Arizona, a single mum to Destiny, 22, Diamond, 19, David, 17, Rose, 16, twins Tyler and Tyson, 14, and Sunshine, 13, started suffering with severe headaches in 2011 and the excruciating pain would last for days.
Told by doctors it was probably due to her hormones, in May 2011, she suffered a particularly bad headache and, trying to shake it off by taking a nap, she woke up and noticed her tongue felt different.
I tried to speak and my voice came out really differently, Michelle explained. I started screaming and my family came in. At first, they thought I was just joking around, because I am a funny person. But I started crying and they realised something was really wrong. It was a joke in my family that Im terrible at accents, so I think when they heard how good it was, they knew I wasnt kidding! I was scared to go to the doctor, though, because I thought hed say I was just crazy, if I started sounding Irish, as I did at that point.
After eight days, during which she hid at home, feeling self-conscious, Michelles voice returned to normal. With no further symptoms, she put the incident to the back of her mind, until it happened again three years later.
She explained: I had moved to California and was on a swing in my back garden when, suddenly, my head started hurting really badly. My ears were ringing and I felt pressure in my head. I passed out on the swing, which was the kind with a back to it, so I slumped over on the side. When I woke up, my face felt funny on the right side and my left hand felt tingly. I hollered and this time came out with an Australian accent. My mother was insisting that I should go to the doctor, but I was still reluctant and it went away after a day or so again, so I just tried to forget it.
But a year later, a third incident changed Michelles life completely.
It was in May 2015 and I will never forget it, she said.
My eyesight went funny. I couldnt see out of my right eye and my whole left side just wouldnt work. My brother drove me to the emergency room. I was losing my cognitive function - I would try to say something and completely different words would come out. It was like I couldnt process words.
After a night in Mercy Medical Center, Redding, California, Michelle woke up and found that most of her cognitive function had returned - but she was speaking with an English accent. Unlike the pattern following previous incidents, her voice did not return to normal.
She said: Weve never been overseas, but my family keep teasing me, saying I sound like I have emigrated to America from England.
Initially, Michelle struggled to come to terms with her new voice, but now she had learned to embrace it.
She said: I felt like I lost a person. I named my son, Tyler, but I pronounce his name completely differently now.
I am an author and public speaker, so when my voice changed, I lost the person that did all those things. I was Miss Black Austin Texas when I was younger, but I feel like Im not that person anymore. I fell into a deep depression about that when this first happened and for about three or four months, I would only leave my house to go to the doctor.
But, supported by family and friends, Michelle has now come to terms with sounding English and realises it is just her voice and not her personality, or achievements, that has changed. Mirror

Yala National Park earns over Rs 700 mn in 2017
The Yala National Park earned Rs. 700.58 million in revenue in 2017. This is the highest income earned by a national park in Sri Lanka.
Deputy Park Warden Ranjith Sisira Kumara said that the number of visitors to Yala is expected to grow in the months of April, August and December. He said that eight bungalows have been opened to cater to the accommodation needs of both foreign and local visitors to the Park, home to over 100 elephants.
Well-known tusker Gemunu has always been popular with foreign and local tourists. He goes close to the jeeps in search of food.
He said that Gemunu had lost one of his tusks when he was attacked by another tusker, Sando, a few days ago.
Wildlife conservationists say that his life is at risk and measures need to be taken to protect Gemunu. The Deputy Park Warden said that all steps will be taken to protect the lives of not only elephants and tuskers, but all other animals as well.

Young women marry trees in mass wedding!
Women in Mexico have given up on men and decided to marry trees instead.
Their new grooms arent very talkative, but they are tall, do great things for the planet and are renowned for their wood so its not surprising they are now sought after in todays dating climate.
Photos from the mass ceremony show brides dressed in white hug and kiss their beloved trunks as they pledge their devotion forever. There was even a bouquet to throw  though presumably one of the humans caught it, rather than a guest from the trees side of the family.
Before you quit Match.com and run to find the nearest sycamore, we should point out that the weddings are not legally binding. Trees cant consent to marital union  but they do need our protection. The wedding was designed to draw attention to the problem of illegal logging in San Jacinto Amilpas, Oaxaca state.
Around a third of Mexicos land area is covered by forest, and there is a widespread problem with illegal logging, mostly controlled by criminal groups.
Oaxaca is one of the five states worst hit by deforestation, and by the marriage stunt campaigners hope to raise the profile of attempts to protect woodland.
Marry a tree began as a ritual of giving thanks to Mother Earth carried out by the organisation Bedani, and later gave way to a symbolic wedding based on Inca customs where women and men marry trees in a rite led by Peruvian actor and environmentalist Richard Torres.

Una McCauley worked tirelessly for the underprivileged
It was with a deep sense of regret that I learnt of the untimely passing of Una McCauley, UN Resident Coordinator and UNDP Resident Representative in Sri Lanka, said Industry and Commerce Minister Rishad Bathiudeen, in a condolence message.
I found the late Ms. McCauley committed to tirelessly supporting the underprivileged, and making special effort to understand the causes of their problems.
As UN Resident Coordinator, on several occasions, she discussed with me the need to resettle IDPs and other issues related to Muslim IDPs and womens rights.
The late Ms. Mc.Cauley also supported the Ministry of Industry and Commerce by taking the time to attend events related to the implementation of the Sustainable Development Goals 9 on industries, innovation and infrastructure.
Even very recently - on January 8 - she was the chief guest at a workshop organized by the Consumer Affairs Authority, which falls under the aegis of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, with UNIDO, where she strongly advocated for the need to ensure stringent regulation of consumer rights.
I admire her sincerity, dedication and commitment to the people of Sri Lanka, and join my staff in extending our profound sympathies to her family and the UN.

2019 Cricket World Cup qualifiers:  Five things to look out for
HARARE, Thursday - Qualifying for the 2019 cricket World Cup gets under way in Zimbabwe on Sunday, with 10 teams battling it out for only two places at next years tournament in England and Wales.
Two-time world champions the West Indies and Afghanistan are favourites to claim the remaining spots for the reduced 10-team World Cup, while fellow Test sides Ireland and Zimbabwe will be hoping to cause an upset.
Here, AFP Sport looks at five things to watch out for during the qualifiers from March 4-25.
CAN UNIVERSE BOSS REVIVE WINDIES
The West Indies are facing the ignominy of failing to qualify, despite being one of only three teams to have won the World Cup on multiple occasions. The Caribbean outfit have slipped out of the top eight in the ODI rankings after a poor run of form and the loss of several key players to T20 franchise leagues.
But star batsman and self-styled Universe Boss Chris Gayle is back and ready to try and add to his tally of 22 ODI hundreds. The big-hitting left-hander turned down the allure of the lucrative Pakistan Super League in order to play in Zimbabwe, and all eyes will be on the 38-year-old as he tries to reach his fifth World Cup.
THE MILLION-DOLLAR LEG-SPINNER
Afghanistans incredible rise has continued to gain momentum over the last 12 months, led by teenage leg-spin sensation Rashid Khan.
The 19-year-old will captain the team for the early part of qualifying in place of the injured Asghar Stanikzai and is closing in on becoming the fastest-ever bowler to reach 100 ODI wickets.
Khan, who was bought by Sunrisers Hyderabad for $1.41 million in last months IPL auction, has taken 86 wickets in 37 ODIs. Mitchell Starcs record of taking only 52 matches to reach 100 wickets is in danger of falling over the next few weeks in a torrent of fizzing leg-breaks and googlies.
FLOUNDERING HOSTS
Host country Zimbabwe, who have played in every World Cup since 1983, have fallen from grace over the last 15 years and are seen as underdogs to qualify. They have only won three matches at the last three World Cups, against the UAE, Canada and Kenya, and were comprehensively beaten 4-1 in a one-day series by Afghanistan last month.
Their hopes will be pinned on the recently-returned Brendan Taylor, Kyle Jarvis and Sean Williams, but an embarrassing loss to one of the games lesser lights is perhaps more likely than qualification.
NEPALESE NAIL-BITERS
Nepal scraped into the qualifying tournament after a series of thrilling victories in the World Cricket League Division Two, culminating in a last-ball, one-wicket win over Canada to book their spot in Zimbabwe. They had also edged to an earlier triumph over Namibia with the last pair at the crease in the final over.
Led by 17-year-old leg-spinner Sandeep Lamichhane, Nepal will be fun to watch in the qualifiers, but any victories will probably result in some frayed nerves back home for their cricket-mad supporters.
BATTLE FOR ODI STATUS
The first group stage may seem to just be a precursor before the stronger sides battle it out for a World Cup place in the following Super Six round, but there are three slots as an ODI nation up for grabs.
The top three Associate teams -- Ireland, Afghanistan, West Indies and Zimbabwe are full ICC members -- will join World Cricket League Championship winners the Netherlands in gaining ODI status until 2022.
As a result, outsiders Nepal, the UAE, Hong Kong, Scotland and Papua New Guinea have plenty on the line in the opening two weeks.

## Title: 84th Battle of the Saints: St. Peters v St. Josephs <U+0B9A>Team that absorbs pressure well will come out on top

84th Battle of the Saints: St. Peters v St. Josephs <U+0B9A>Team that absorbs pressure well will come out on top
The 84th Battle of the Saints between St. Peters College and St. Josephs College will unfold with usual comradeship at P.Sara Oval today and tomorrow.
Two days of exciting cricket can be expected from these two Catholic schools, even though St. Josephs College has a slight edge due to their recent purple-patch leading up to the Big Match. Meanwhile St. Peters will try hard to turn tables on the Joes and bring a victory to the Bambalapitiya school.
The two prestigious institutions will battle it out for the Rev.Fr Maurice Le Goc trophy, which started way back in 1933 with St. Josephs College winning the inaugural clash. Robert Fernando led St. Josephs College in the first encounter while George Jayaweera led St. Peters College.
Rev.Fr Maurice Le Goc was the rector of both the schools and the trophy for the Big match is named in his honour. He first served at St. Josephs College and then went on to become the first rector at St. Peters College.
Of the 83 matches played between these two great cricketing schools so far St. Josephs lead the tally with 12 wins while St. Peters have won on 10 occasions with 61 matches ending in draws.
St. Josephs last won the 74th Battle of the Saints under the leadership of Ruwantha Fernandopulle in 2008 and St. Peters won the 82nd Battle of the Saints under all rounder Vinu Mohottis captaincy in 2016.
The highest score in the Battle of the Saints series is by St Josephs when they made 382 in 1982 under the leadership of Ken Serpanchy. The highest Peterite score was in 1938 under Percy Perera where they accumulated 345 runs.
St.Peters were bowled out for a paltry score of 36 in 1972 and incidentally this remains the lowest score of the series. St. Josephs lowest score was 56 in 1938. The highest individual score of the series is 204 by Clive Inman in 1954 and the best bowling figures for an inning is 9 for 41 by Shenal Warnakula of St Josephs in 1997.
St.Peters will be led by Sri Lanka under 19 cricketer cum all rounder Santhush Gunathilaka and theyve had a mixed season recording five outright wins and three outright loses as well.
Big match is a totally a different game to other matches. We are going into this match as the underdogs and we are hoping to play positive cricket and try our best to win the trophy again which we last won in 2016 said Gunathilaka.
Spinners Sachin Silva and Ameen Miflal have brought many strong batting lineups down to their knees as they have taken over 175 wickets between them this season. If these two bowlers show the same form St. Josephs will have a difficult time.
The two pillars of the Peterite batting are Shalith Fernando who tops the batting with nearly 750 runs while all rounder and left handed batsmen Ranmith Jayasena with a tally of over 700 runs.
The other top scorers are Gunathilake over 675 runs, Shannon Fernando close to 650 runs and Sulakshana Fernando nearly 500 runs. They will be expected to make their contributions to bolster the Peters scoreboard. They have got their team off to blazing starts many times this season and they will be itching to continue the trend this weekend in the most important big match as well.
Former St.Peters 1st XI skipper and Sri Lanka cricketer Malinda Warnapura who coaches the Peterites said, We have won five games outright this year due to having a balanced side and we go out as underdogs with Shalith and Ranmith leading the way in the batting department. We are also lucky to have as assistant coaches Kito Fernandopulle and Shanaka Perera and a fabulous bowling coach in Crishantha Peiris. He (Peiris) has produced two wicket-taking match winners in spinners Ameen who has got over 100 wickets under his belt and Sachin 70 scalps. This is the main reason we have achieved five outright wins along with our batters this season. We will try our level best to play a good brand of cricket and since this is a big match, whoever absorbs the pressure in the end will come out on top.
Jehan Daniel the Josephian skipper weighing his team chances said, We are going into this game as favourites and along with all my team mates we will play positive cricket to bring the trophy back to our college which has eluded us for the past nine years.
Revan Kelly, Lakshan Gamage and vice-captain Nipun Sumanasinghes success with the bat will be very vital for the Josephians chances of regaining the trophy. Kelly is the top run-scorer for the Darley Road boys with over 1100 runs this season while Sumanasinghe and Lakshan Gamage have scored over 700 runs. Fast-bowling all-rounder cum captain Daniel will need to shine as he has a niche for performing on big occasions.
Meanwhile Jehans cousin brother Ashien Daniel together with Dunith Wellalage have been lethal throughout the season taking over 135 wickets between them.
Both sides are very strong and have done well this season. Batting is our strength as we have a definite advantage with our batters doing really well in the ongoing school season along with our bowlers, said veteran Sri Lanka cricketer cum Josephian coach Roger Wijesuriya. I am trying my best to see the match ends on a good note. We will set the bench mark in this game for sure.
With the first-innings restricted to 60 overs per side since year 2000, both these teams will have an equal opportunity to produce a noteworthy team performance and win the game, but most of the matches at P. Sara Oval have produced high scores even though the bowlers had enjoyed the surface.

Aquaponics farming at Habarana Village
Habarana Village by Cinnamon introduced a novel initiative of sustainable and resourceful farming in the drought-ridden region. Habarana Village by Cinnamon, also a popular tourist destination during the dry season due to the legendary elephant gathering in the bordering lake is introducing aquaponics to the surrounding village community, a farming model that is fast being accepted globally as the ideal cultivation system for water scarcity.
The newly introduced aquaponics farming model is a combination of aquaculture and hydroponics, which combines farming fish and growing plants using soil-less processes. The symbiotic relationship thrives because the nutrient-dense fish waste, similar to cow manure, flows through the plant nursery, acting as a natural fertilizer to successfully grow crops. The system also eliminates the use of pesticides and insecticides since it would kill the fish, thereby harvesting super clean, super pure produce.
The resort heavily promotes environmentally-friendly practices and a village-way of life, co-existing with neighbouring villages where most of their fresh produce is currently purchased. This project aims to impress the significance of climatically adaptable farming practices upon the community, and most importantly the potential for multiple revenue streams; farming consumable fish along with the produce.
A growing market demand for organic vegetables is also beneficial for farmers, with proven fast-growing cycles of aquaponics due to the high levels of nutrients the plants are able to absorb. In terms of water requirement, research shows that aquaponics uses up to 90 per cent less water than traditional methods due to the recirculating system.
Commercial aquaponics is the food production system of the future. We plan to create awareness of this innovative system among our neighbouring communities, the local Farmers Association as well as other groups and stakeholders, and especially among school children, to help them understand the advantages of aquaponics, so that they can benefit from this sustainable and profitable farming model, Habarana Village, General Manager, Marlon Robert said.

Rescheduling IPL games in Kolkata
BCCI refuses to comply with ICCs request
The International Cricket Council has scheduled a high profile meeting in Kolkata. The Annual board meeting is to take place from 22 to 26 April. Hence they had requested to reschedule an IPL game in Kolkata during that period. However, if reports are to be believed, the BCCI has turned it down.
Apparently, some of the delegates in the ICC wished to watch an IPL game during that period. But since Kolkata Knight Riders dont play any home game during that duration, BCCI found it difficult to make any further changes.
ICC requested for a change in schedule for its various members to watch an IPL game
The Indian Premier League completed a decade last year. It has been widely regarded the greatest league to be played across the world. Hence, it comes as no surprise that the ICC delegates requested to watch an IPL game.
A senior BCCI official confirmed the news but stated that KKR wasnt playing any home games between 16 April to 3 of May. He further told that if the BCCI tried to make any changes in the fixture, it would result in a lot of mix-ups.
Yes, there was a specific request from ICC as they wanted its various member delegates to watch an IPL game. However, between April 22 and 26, there are no home games of KKR at the Eden Gardens. If we have to reschedule it, the entire itinerary would be in disarray. So we told them that its not possible to have an IPL match rescheduled, the official was quoted as saying by PTI.
There is also a lot of uncertainty regarding PCB chairman Najam Sethis attendance. The meeting is being held in Kolkata rather than Mumbai to avoid any political interference. However, there is a huge doubt if Sethi gets the visa considering the relationship between both countries.
