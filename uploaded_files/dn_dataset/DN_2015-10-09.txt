Abandoned infant critical
The 18-day-old infant girl wrapped in a piece of cloth and found abandoned by her mother at Kandy Dangolla Junction on October 6 is now under the care of the Peradeniya Teaching Hospital.
Doctors said the infant fed on powdered milk in place of mother's milk is in a critical condition.
The infant's mother claiming to be a resident of Penideniya had left a letter written by her near the infant saying she was not in a position to bring her up as she is already a mother of four struggling in a state of poverty.
Peradeniya Police investigating the incident is going through records of child births at the Peradeniya and Kandy Hospitals during the past one month in an effort to trace the mother involved.

Ayurvedic treatment upgraded in NCP
The North Central Provincial Ayurvedic Department has embarked on an Ayurvedic treatment upgrading programme.
Provincial Ayurvedic Commissioner and in-charge of the Ayurvedic Panchakarma section of the Anuradhapura Ayurvedic General Hospital Dr. Kumara Alwis told the Daily News that the programme included the expansion of services at hospitals, opening of new rural Ayurvedic hospitals, establishment of 37 Ayurvedic villages in the province, kidney diseases prevention project and the strengthening of hospital staff.
Steps are also taken to obtain the support of the registered and unregistered native physicians in the province to implement the proposed development venture through the grass roots level Ayurvedic preservation sabhas.
Around 1,000 native physicians are practicing Ayurvedic and native treatments.
"We will hold special clinical service to the needy. We need Rs. 30 million for the programme," Dr. Alwis said.
"It is also intended to make the people aware of the importance of consuming native food and beverages instead of imported items. Nature has endowed the people in Rajarata with nutritious food such as Kurukkan, Cawpe, green gram, traditional rice, pumpkin, melon, kekiri neeramulliya and ikiriya," he said.
He said arrangements are underway to establish 37 Ayurvedic villages at the Divisional Secretariat Divisions level in the province.
Dr. Alwis said the Provincial Ayurvedic Department aims at opening an Ayurvedic hospital in each Divisional Secretariat division in the province.

Belarussian voice of survivors wins Nobel Prize in Literature
Svetlana Alexievich, a Belarussian journalist and prose writer known for deeply researched works about female Russian soldiers in World War II and the aftermath of the Chernobyl nuclear disaster, won the Nobel Prize in Literature on Thursday "for her polyphonic writings, a monument to suffering and courage in our time," the Swedish Academy announced.
Alexievich, 67, is the 14th woman to win the literature prize, and one of just a few Nobel laureates to be recognized for nonfiction. While the Nobel committee has occasionally awarded the prize to philosophers and historians, including Bertrand Russell and Winston Churchill, it has been more than half a century since a dedicated nonfiction writer has won what many regard as literature's most prestigious award.
The selection of Ms. Alexievich was lauded as a long overdue corrective, and as a high point for journalism as a literary art. By placing her work alongside those of international literary giants like Gabriel Garca Mrquez, Albert Camus, Alice Munro and Toni Morrison, the Nobel committee has anointed a genre that is often viewed as a vehicle for information rather than an aesthetic endeavor.

Between 20 to 25 pc Lankans suffer from mental disorders
Between 20 to 25 percent of the Sri Lankan population suffer from various mental disorders. The majority suffer from minor mental disorders, while others suffer from serious mental sicknesses, a Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry spokesman said.
According to the spokesman, the statistics were released following a recent survey.
Annually, around 8,000 patients are admitted to the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Mulleriyawa and 1,000 of them receive in-house long term treatment.
A 24 hour emergency treatment unit is available at the NIMH for violent patients suffering from serious mental sicknesses.
Several programmes have been arranged in Sri Lanka to mark World Mental Health Day which falls today. A seminar was held for the media on October 5 at the NIMH, while a kite festival, street dramas and a walk were held in Colombo yesterday.
An educational programme organised to mark the day will be held today.
A public exhibition, a creations fair and educational programmes for schoolchildren will be held tomorrow. The creations are by in-house patients of NIMH.
The public can visit the hospital on Monday and obtain first hand experience on the day to day life at the hospital. An education programme has been organised for the health staff on October 13, he added.
Meanwhile, volunteer workers at the Jaffna Teaching Hospital during the 30 year conflict, have been confirmed on the directive of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne.
Dr. Senaratne said another 38 workers attached to Thelippalai Hospital were allowed to continue in their positions.
"All health workers in state hospitals during the war will be confirmed in their positions as they served the people while health staff from Colombo could not reach them," he told a recent ceremony.

'Bolder measures needed to address NCDs'
Bolder measures need to be taken to address Non Communicable Diseases (NCDs) if Sri Lanka intends to meet the target to reduce premature mortality by 33 percent in 2030, said Senior Adviser, WHO Headquarters Geneva, Dr. Nick Banatvala.
Addressing the media in Colombo yesterday, Dr. Banatvala said to ensure that the UN agencies in Sri Lanka extend their support for the national NCD response in a coordinated manner, the UN Task force is recommending that the UN agencies in Sri Lanka establish UN Thematic Group on NCDs under the leadership of the World Health Organisation (WHO).
The joint mission discussed the draft National Multisectoral Action plan for prevention and control of NCDs 2016 - 2020, which sets out a plan for all parts of the government to work together with development partners to combat the NCD epidemic, he said.
NCDs have become a serious economic as well as public health issue in Sri Lanka, said Health Ministry Non Communicable Diseases Director Dr. Thilak Siriwardena.
"It is fueled by tobacco use, unhealthy diet, harmful use of alcohol and physical inactivity," he said.
Dr. Siriwardena said that in 2012, 75 percent of deaths in Sri Lanka were due to NCDs.
The four main diseases were cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes mellitus and Chronic respiratory diseases, he said.
Sri Lanka is the second country in the WHO South-East Asia Region to host a Joint Mission of the Task Force, said WHO in Sri Lanka representative Dr. Jacob Kumaresan.
Dr. Kumaresan said that if affordable evidence based policies like raising tax on tobacco, banning all forms of tobacco advertising, restricting or banning alcohol advertising, preventing heart attack or strokes, promoting breast feeding, implementing public health awareness programmes on diet and physical activity and preventing cancer through screening are implemented, it could result in dramatic reduction in NCDs over a short period.
The World Bank is engaged with the government in a USD 200 million operation to upgrade the standard of performance of the public health system, said World Bank Senior Health Specialist Dr. Kumari Vinodhani Navaratne.
She added that NCDs are a burden on Sri Lanka's growth.
The mission will enable Sri Lanka to respond well to the challenges of malnutrition and NCDs, Dr. Navaratne said.
A joint mission of United Nations Inter agency Task Force on the Prevention and Control of NCDs agreed to support the government in tackling NCDs.
The mission included representatives from the International Organization of Migration (IOM), International Labour Organization (ILO), Joint united Nations programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS), United Nations Development Programme (UNDP), United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA), United Nations Educational, scientific and cultural organization (UNESCO), United Nations Children Fund (UNICEF), UN Volunteers (UNV), World food programme (WFP), World Bank and the World Health Organization (WHO).

Four Russian missiles miss Syrian targets, hit Iran - US
US: Four Russian cruise missiles launched from the Caspian Sea fell short of their Syrian targets and landed in a rural part of Iran, U.S. officials said Thursday, amid growing international concern about Russia's actions in the region.
The errant strikes were part of a volley of 26 long-range cruise missiles that Russia fired Wednesday, U.S. officials told USA TODAY. The officials asked not to be identified because they were not authorized to discuss intelligence matters.
The flight path for the Kalibr cruise missiles, which had not previously been used in combat conditions, took them over Iran and Iraq. One official said the U.S. wasn't able to detect any casualties or damage from the errant strikes, suggesting they may have fallen harmlessly in Iran. Russia, which recently began conducting airstrikes and expanded its military presence in Syria, denied any strikes missed their intended Syrian targets. Iran's defense ministry dismissed the claims as "psychological warfare."
Still, Russia's growing military activity in the region has raised worries that a mishap could trigger a wider war as Russian ships, aircraft and troops intensify operations in what the U.S. says is a bid to prop up longtime ally Syrian President Bashar Assad rather than combat the Islamic State.
"This will have consequences for Russia itself," Defense Secretary Ashton Carter said at a NATO meeting in Brussels on Thursday. "I also expect that in coming days, the Russians will begin to suffer casualties in Syria."
Carter - who characterized Russia's behavior as "unprofessional" - said Russian aircraft have violated Turkish airspace and come within miles of a U.S. drone. In addition, their ships have fired cruise missiles without warning and their armed forces have backed a Syrian government "joint ground offensive."
The U.S. says Russia's cruise missiles and airstrikes appear aimed at supporting the ground offensive and attacking more secular forces opposing Assad in Syria's brutal 4-year-old civil war that has left 250,000 people dead, according to United Nations figures.
"This is a fundamental strategic mistake and that it will inflame and prolong the Syrian civil war," Carter said.
Russia has maintained it is targeting the Islamic State and other extremist groups in Syria. Washington's strategy in Syria is aimed at combating the Islamic State, also known as ISIL, and pushing for a political transition that would remove Assad from power.

Nobel Peace Prize for Tunisian National Dialogue Quartet
The Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Tunisia's National Dialogue Quartet for helping the country's transition to democracy.
The Nobel committee said the group of civil society organisations had made a "decisive contribution" to democracy after the 2011 revolution.
It said the quartet helped establish a political process when the country "was on the brink of civil war".
Tunisia's uprising was the first and most successful of the Arab Spring.
While other countries - Libya, Egypt, Yemen and Syria - either reverted to authoritarian rule or descended into violence and chaos, Tunisia managed a successful transition to democracy.
The surprise winner of this year's Nobel Peace Prize has played a key role in mediating between the different parties in the country's post-Arab Spring government.
The Quartet is credited with creating a national dialogue between the country's Islamist and secular coalition parties amid deepening political and economic crisis in 2013.
Tunisia's revolution - also known as the Jasmine Revolution - began in late 2010 and led to the ousting of President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali in January 2011, followed by the country's first free democratic elections last year.
Kaci Kullman Five, the chair of the Nobel peace committee, said the Quartet's role in Tunisia's democratisation was "directly comparable to the peace conferences mentioned by Alfred Nobel in his will". Nobel Peace Prize winners through the years
Houcine Abassi, head of Tunisia's General Labour Union - one of the groups in the quartet - said the award was a "tribute to martyrs of a democratic Tunisia".
"This effort by our youth has allowed the country to turn the page on dictatorship," he said.
Abdessattar Ben Moussa of the Human Rights League - another of the quartet - said the award "fills us with joy" at a time when Tunisia "is going through a period marked by political tensions and terrorist threats".

Boat owners and equipment in custody must be penalised - Herath
Fishing vessels and equipment of the Indian fishermen poaching into Sri Lankan waters must be taken into custody and the owners of the equipment must be produced before courts, JVP MP Vijitha Herath said.
The MP was moving an adjournment motion in Parliament yesterday. He observed that the vessels are mostly owned by South Indian politicians.
"The politicians including Tamil Nadu Chief Minister Jayalalithaa, have politicized this issue. The Sri Lankan government too releases the Indian fishermen on a regularly basis due to political interference.
The Indian fishermen are arrested for violating the Immigration and Emigration laws. Instead, we request the government to use the provisions of the Fisheries (Regulation of Foreign Fishing Boats) Act of 1979 and take those vessels into Sri Lankan custody," he observed.
The MP also urged the President and the government to take immediate action to protect the Sri Lankan maritime bounding, as it is a matter of territorial integrity and sovereignty. He pointed out that the Indian trawlers take away Rs 8,640 million worth of fish annually from Sri Lankan waters, which was directly affecting the economy of the country.
Seconding the motion TNA MP S M A Sumanthiran urged the government to revise the law to completely ban the bottom trawling.
He observed the bottom trawling is only regulated under the existing provisions in the Fisheries and Acquatic Resources Act, adding that this Act should be amended to completely ban this destructive fishing method. He noted all the marine resources including sea bed are badly affected due to bottom trawling.
He also directed the attention of the government over the poaching of fishermen from the Southern and Western parts of the country into the seas off the Northern part.
To prevent fishermen crossing IMB, naval and coast guard help vital
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan told Parliament yesterday, that the Sri Lankan Government should discuss with the Indian Government and the Tamil Nadu State to device a programme to get Sri Lanka's and India's Naval and Coast Guard support to prevent fishermen of both countries crossing the International Maritime Borders(IMB).
He made these observations while participating in the debate at the time of the adjournment of the House. Northern fishermen met with President Maithripala Sirisena recently. They told President Sirisena of the problems they face due poaching by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters.
The President instructed the Navy to stop Indian fishermen entering Sri Lankan waters, but later, this programme was not implemented properly.
Once again, fishermen in the North are continuing to be deprived of their livelihood.
"We hope that this issue would be sorted out with any problem to both countries. Fishermen of the North and East could not ply their trades due to the 30-year long war. Even after the war ended, they lived a life burdened with debt.
"Now the time has come to provide a permanent solution to this problem. Indian fishermen poach in Sri Lankan waters at their will. Their use of bottom trawling has resulted in depriving us of our future harvest of fish, the Opposition Leader said.
Govt. responsible to solve poaching by Indian fishermen
This government has a responsibility to solve issues pertaining to Indian fishermen poaching in our territorial waters by way of diplomatic discussions with the Indian Government, said UNP Parliamentarian S. M. Marikkar.
He also said the previous government was unable to find a solution to this issue though it was debated once every two to three months. He added that this government had developed cordial relationships with the Indian government unlike the previous government, so that there is a conducive environment to solve this issue.
He also stated that poaching by Indian fishermen in our waters had been a 30-year-old issue. They exploited the situation of terrorism to poach into our waters as our fishermen could not go fishing.
MP Marikkar further stated that with the elimination of terrorism, the people were under the impression that the economy could be developed by fishing and tourism industries. He also added that it had not been able due to the poaching. He further said the Indian Government did not attend to the issue due to the fact that South Indian politicians are benefiting from this situation.
He made these observations yesterday joining the Adjournment Motion moved by JVP Parliamentarian Vijitha Herath.
Govt will take measures to uplift living standards of fisher folk - Niroshan Perera
National Policies and Economic Affairs Minister Niroshan Perera, said that the new government is committed to solve the issues pertaining to fisher folk.
He said the previous government did not take any measures to find a tangible solution to the Indian - Sri Lanka fishermen's conflict. He added under the Leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, the government would discuss this matter with the Indian government to find a solution.
He added the government would also take measures to develop the fishing industry to uplift the living standards of the fisher folk of the country.

Refugee crisis: Europe to speed up migrant deportations
Luxembourg: The union discussed creating a border force among measures to cope with hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria's civil war. Nearly 600,000 people have flooded into Europe this year.
The policy document approved in Luxembourg called on states to ensure more of those ordered to leave actually went. Some 470,000 expulsion orders were made last year but fewer than 40 per cent of them were enforced.
Ministers declined to put figures on future deportations.
"Increased return rates should act as a deterrent to irregular migration," read the conclusions, which also included approval of detention for those who may abscond before expulsion and called for more "leverage" to be exercised on African and other poor states, including via aid budgets, to make them accept the return of citizens refused entry to Europe.
"Returns are always tough," German Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere said.
"But ... we can only offer space and support to refugees in need of protection if those who don't need protection don't come or are quickly returned." Sydney Morning Herald

Scientists sequence first ancient African human genome
New York: Scientists have recovered the genome of a 4500-year-old human skeleton in Ethiopia - the first time a complete assemblage of DNA has been retrieved from an ancient human in Africa.
The DNA of the Ethiopian fossil is strikingly different from that of living Africans. Writing in the journal Science, the researchers conclude that people from the Near East spread into Africa 3000 years ago. In later generations, their DNA ended up scattered across the continent.
For decades, scientists had doubted that ancient DNA could survive in the tropics. The new study raises hopes that scientists can recover far older human genomes from Africa - perhaps dating back 1 million years or more.
"I would bet it's not that far in the future," said Lee Berger, a paleoanthropologist at the University of Witwatersrand who recently announced the discovery of an ancient human-like species called Homo naledi.
In the 1980s, few scientists would have believed it possible to reconstruct an entire genome from the DNA in a fossil. Once a human or other animal dies, its DNA starts to fall apart. Bacteria swiftly colonise the corpse, overwhelming it with their own DNA.
But by the 1990s scientists were beginning to retrieve fragments of DNA and piece them together into longer segments. In 2010, researchers assembled the genome of a Neanderthal from 38,000-year-old fossils from Croatia.
In many other cases, researchers failed to find ancient DNA in human fossils. Because it was widely suspected that the heat and humidity in the tropics would destroy genetic material, many scientists flocked to places like Siberia to search for ancient DNA.
That skepticism proved to be unwarranted. In recent years, Ron Pinhasi, an archaeologist at University College Dublin, and his colleagues have been surveying different bones to see if any are particularly good for preserving DNA. They found that the bone surrounding the inner ear can hold an abundance of genetic material even when other bones have lost theirs.
As they reported last year, the scientists were able to pull out genomes from the ear bones of hundreds of Europeans who lived thousands of years ago. Their success gave them hope that they might be able to rescue ancient DNA from African skeletons as well.
They got their chance when John Arthur and Kathryn Weedman Arthur, archaeologists at the University of South Florida, and their colleagues uncovered the skeleton of a man in the Mota cave, in the highlands of southern Ethiopia. Mota, as the scientists refer to the man, was laid out in a ceremonial burial. His head rested on a pillow-like stone, his hands were folded under his body, and he was surrounded by stone tools.
The researchers sent Dr Pinhasi a sample of the inner ear bone, hoping that he and his colleagues could fish out some DNA. They succeeded spectacularly, extracting enough DNA to reconstruct Mota's entire genome.
Dr Pinhasi and his colleagues also got some clues about what Mota was like by looking at some of his genes. He was probably brown-skinned and had brown eyes, for example. He also had genetic adaptations for living at high altitudes - the same adaptations found in Ethiopian highlanders today.
The scientists then sought to fit Mota into the history of humankind. Ethiopia is home to the oldest fossils of our species, dating back about 200,000 years. Humans later expanded across Africa. Later, sometime between 100,000 and 50,000 years ago, our species began to spread into Asia and Europe.
In recent years, scientists have found segments of DNA in Ethiopians and other Africans that bear a striking resemblance to those found in people from Europe and Asia. They proposed that there was a "backflow" of genes into Africa roughly 3000 years ago.
Dr Pinhasi and his colleagues found that Mota, who lived 1500 years before that time, had no trace of Eurasian DNA in his genome. "It's an African without this backflow", he said.

Sri Lankan refugees return home
Nine-year-old Arunraj and his younger sister Rakshana are excited about their journey on Thursday. For the first time in their lives, they would be travelling by an airplane and both want to have a window seat.
The children born to a Sri Lankan refugee couple in a special camp at Adiyanuthu in Dindigul district of Tamil Nadu, are among the 73 who left the special camps for Sri Lanka with the assistance of the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) on Thursday, to start a new life on the island.
"We fled Vavuniya in 1990 fearing for our lives. I was nine years old when we came to Mandapam by boat. We want to go back because all our relatives are there," said the children's mother S. Theresamma.
Her husband returned to Sri Lanka five months ago to see whether the situation in Mannar was conducive to them to resettle. "He said jobs in Ceylon are a problem. But we are confident of finding some livelihood as I have learnt tailoring. We will send our children to school there."
For 26-year old M. Prakash of Mandapam camp in Rameswaram, who came to Arichamunai by boat in 2007, concerns over his future prompted him to decide to return.
"I have studied only upto Class 10. Though there are schools here, my situation did not allow me to study and so I worked in a fishing company for a daily wage. I have saved some money, but I can't buy any land here as I will be a refugee as long as I live here," the native of Jaffna pointed out. He intends to look for jobs in Malaysia or Singapore, once he returns to Sri Lanka.
Though the conflict between the government and the rebel forces ended on the island in May 2009, about 102 thousand refugees from Sri Lanka still remain in special camps across Tamil Nadu.
"We assist Sri Lankan refugees, who voluntarily decide to return to their native country. We help them in their documentation and facilitate and financially support their travel. On their arrival, UNHCR Sri Lanka provides some support to assist them in settling down," UNHCR India's spokesperson Shuchita Mehta said.
Between 2002 and 2014, UNHCR India has assisted about 12,500 Lankan refugees in voluntary repatriation. Since January, a total of 315 refugees returned home.

Teachers refuse to teach, school closed for second day
Balapitiya National School was closed for the second day since teachers refused to teach yesterday.
The teachers demanded the removal of 12 students who were involved in anti-disciplinary activities.
The National School director was to arrive at the school for an investigation.
The school was closed abruptly on Thursday morning since 71 members of the 89 member tutorial staff were absent on sick leave.
Only 18 teachers were present and the Principal had to close the school and send the students home.
After the students left, the gates were closed to prevent outsiders from entering the school premises.
Reports said a majority of teachers did not report for duty yesterday to show their discontent over the acts of indiscipline committed by certain senior boisterous students.

As tension mounts, Palestinian protesters turn up the intensity
West Bank: At one riotous demonstration this week, Palestinian university students seemed to be inviting Israeli soldiers to shoot them, moving closer rather than away from the drawn rifles and pointing at their chests as though offering target practice.
At another, an unusually large number of young women than men turned out, all but their eyes covered in the signature black-and-white checked keffiyehs. These teenagers in tight jeans and sneakers hurled rocks and firebombs, too, but resentful boys accused them of sometimes panicking when the Israelis responded with tear gas and of screaming when the rubber bullets flew.
A third protest brought unusually large numbers of prepubescent boys, many still in their striped school uniforms and hauling book-filled backpacks. "Look how small you are!" exclaimed an older man as a group that did not reach his waist galloped past and ducked behind a wall to avoid gas. Laith, all of 10 years old, grinned and boasted: "I want to liberate Palestine!"
As a series of apparently lone-wolf Palestinians have attacked Israelis, mostly with knives, over the past week, they have been accompanied by swelling protests in the occupied West Bank, East Jerusalem and even in Jaffa and other Israeli towns with large populations of Arab citizens. Clashes between young Palestinians and Israeli settlers and soldiers are as old as the conflict itself, but the demonstrations in recent days have been more numerous, more sustained and more confrontational than those of the past few years.
"We feel that the intifada has begun," said Mohammad Zeid, 23, an activist at Birzeit University, on a hill outside Ramallah, who said the demonstrations were a way to continue momentum. "This is a letter to our political leaders: We don't want submission, which is what they think peace is."
Some protests break out spontaneously, as when hundreds gathered late Thursday night in Kufr Aqab, a crowded neighborhood on the outskirts of Jerusalem, to block Israeli forces from raiding the home of Thaer Abu Ghazala, 19, who was killed by a soldier after wounding four Israelis with a screwdriver near military headquarters in Tel Aviv.
Frequent flash points are the funerals for such so-called martyrs, and a huge crowd was expected Friday afternoon to mourn Muhanad Halabi, 19, the law student who fatally stabbed two Orthodox men on Saturday night in Jerusalem's Old City.
"Muhanad is a hero!" thousands chanted Friday morning outside the Ramallah hospital where his body awaited burial.
Other demonstrations have been planned by political factions, who bused students from the universities of Birzeit and Bethlehem to friction points with Israelis two days running.
"Cage a cat in a room and it will start scratching you - we are like the cats now," said Elias Sarras, who has worked at the Bethlehem campus for 32 years and said the atmosphere now "looks like it did" during the Palestinian intifadas, or uprisings, of decades past. "The students encourage each other to protest because of the ongoing conflict, and it doesn't take much to make them move."
The Israeli military has bolstered its presence in the West Bank and the police have flushed Jerusalem with some 2,000 additional officers to contain the outbursts they universally call riots.
