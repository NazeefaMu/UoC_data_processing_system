Rugby inspired me to be what I am today - Rohantha Peiris

To Rohantha Peiris, rugby is not just a game - it's a passion and a passionate pastime in his life. As the Managing Director, Ace Cargo (Pvt) Ltd, he still cherishes the lessons he learnt as an outstanding rugby captain for his alma mater Royal College.
Perhaps, sports would have been the very reason for his gaining an employment opportunity in one of Sri Lanka's major blue chip companies - Aitken Spence Group.
Talking to the Daily News, Peiris who will be the chief guest at the first leg of the Bradby Shield encounter between Royal and Trinity at Royal
Sports Complex on Saturday recalled how an illustrious sports career could help build one's character.
I believe in teamwork. This is one major lesson that my favourite game - rugby has taught me throughout years, said Peiris.
Sports helped me to infuse qualities such as leadership, sharing work, character building, delegating work, determination and having faith in my team mates, he said.
Like in many others, school time was the best era of Peiris life. I owe everything to my school; actually it is not just a school, but an institution where students characters were nurtured with dignity and honesty.
Speaking further Peiris said, After winning the Bradby Shield in 1975 by a record 61 points to 6 (both legs) in 1976 we unfortunately lost it in 1977.
This loss gave me mental agony which I had to go through. It made me determined to somehow bring back the Bradby in 1978 under my captaincy.
Royal had great Bradby years like 1975, 1976, 1978, 1984, 1988, 1998, 2002, 2009, 2011 and 2015 but Peiris chose 1978 as the pick of it.
All are great years of our college rugby and great teams but I personally believe its undoubtedly the 1978 team that stands out the very best from the rest, not because I was the captain but due to the fact that we played with only four coloursmen and 11 freshers, recalled Peiris.
Eventually I had to follow Robert Aldrich famous Hollywood film; The Dirty Dozen pick and choose theory to select my best players in 1978 for the matches to remain as unbeaten champions.
My best moment in school rugby was when under my captaincy in 1978 we regained the Bradby by winning the Kandy leg 8-4 after the Colombo leg had ended in a nil-all draw. We also went to Thailand and ended runners-up to Vajiravudh College in the championship and todate no other Sri Lankan school has managed to equal this feat.
Further from that 1978 Royal team, 12 players played club rugby, four captained their respective clubs and seven players went on to represent the Sri Lankan national team which stands as a record todate, Peiris said. Turning his attention on Royals highest try scorer and specialist of the rolling maul Supun Warnakulasuriya, Peiris commented, Fantastic player no other words to tell. He has a spectacular high spirit in him and I have no second thoughts that he will go onto represent the Sri Lankan national team in the very near future.
Peiris had the unique feat of representing triple champions Havelock Sports Club in the knockout tournament in 1976 while still a schoolboy.
After leaving school in 1978, Peiris continued to play club rugby for CR & FC, where he earned a reputation as a much sought-after ruggerite. He played club rugby for eight consecutive years before finally hanging up his boots in 1985 after captaining CR.
Going down memory lane Peiris spoke highly of his co-centre at CR & FC and ex-Thomian captain Christopher Jordash.
Jody was a true and humble gentleman on and off the field, a superb unprecedented player who at a glance knew all our moves, said Peiris.
When I run with the ball he knew my moves to support and when he ran with the ball I knew his moves and supported him all the way. With our combination we scored many tries for CR.
When Peiris was reminded of how he made use of a then largely unknown lineout rule to take a quick throw-in being the centre three quarter and left everyone foxed and engineered a win for his team in the inaugural R.Premadasa trophy knockout tournament final in 1984 when his team was trailing CH&FC, he replied, Yes, you have to know the rules and along with the thinking power in a split second you should know when to use them.
Peiris also went onto represent the Sri Lankan national team in both the sevens and fifteens and said his best moment in the playing field was in 1984 when Sri Lanka won the Hong Kong Bowl championship under inspirational captaincy of Hisham Abdeen, which todate remains as Sri Lankas best performance at the Hong Kong Sevens tournament.
In conclusion Peiris said, My father and mother have been my major inspiration for who I am today, hence I am eternally grateful to both of them.

Young who has been preparing for his 2016 campaign by working on his personal fitness and driving skills got his 2016 rally hopes off to a great sprint by winning the opening round of the West Australia Rally Championship, held near Perth last weekend.
Driving for his second year with the Sri Lankan motor racing team, EZY Racing, Young will be provided an upgraded and lighter version of the Subaru WRX, engineered by Cusco to keep his Championship Challenge alive with the much faster MRF Skodas.
Mike Young

Young, sharing his excitement on the new car said The Cusco prepared Subaru WRX Rally car powered by EZY Racing is lighter, giving us confidence for another great season.
With the Rally Season Due to be kicked off today eveining (April 29) in central Whangarei,the 275 kilometer Rally will see a mixture of experienced and young drivers such as former FIA Asia Pacific Rally Champion Gaurav Gill from MRF SKODA Team and other younger contenders like Mike Young and Fabian Kreim. The event ranges over 275 kilometers.
It is great to be back in New Zealand for my home rally  a rally I look forward to every year given my familiarity with the roads of Whangarei. commented Young. Im sure it will be a competitive event against the new Skoda cars, but Im looking forward to the challenge.
The 2015 Championship winners MRF Skoda team are expected to release the SKODA Fabia R5s, a much faster variant to what was seen in 2015.
Commenting on his teams chances, Founder of Sri Lankas only International Motor Racing Team, Shafraz Hamzadeen said We need to keep our hopes very realistic. In 2015 we did see a few brilliant stage times from Mike (Young) which allowed us to win a stage or two.
This year we feel it is going to be even more difficult as the Skodas will be much faster with the lighter and faster R5s. Our focus will be to be the best of the rest and hope that we would be able to capitalize on any issues that would crop up on the Skodas.
EZY Racing whose Sri Lankan racing unit recently completed a successful stint in the gravel circuits, would be eagerly looking forward for a podium finish in Rally Whangarai, a fond location where they won their very first International podium in 2015.

Fu joins Ding in World Championship semi-finals

Dreams of a first Asian world snooker champion moved closer to reality as Hong Kong's Marco Fu joined China's Ding Junhui in the semi-finals of this year's World Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre on Wednesday.
The pair have been kept apart in the last four, raising the prospect of an all-Asian final to decide the winner of snooker's most prestigious prize.
Fu withstood a fightback by Barry Hawkins to win 13-1l on Wednesday, the day after Ding became the first man into this year's semi-finals with a 13-3 thrashing of former champion Mark Williams.
Now Fu will faces England's world number one Mark Selby in the last four, with Ding up against experienced Scottish cueman Alan McManus.
Since the modern World Championship came into being in 1969, only two players from outside Britain and Ireland -- Canada's Cliff Thorburn (1980) and Australia's Neil Robertson (2010) -- have lifted the trophy. An estimated audience of 100 million in China alone watched Ding beat Fu to win the 2011 Masters title, proof both of the Chinese player's popularity in his homeland in particular and the growing appeal of snooker in general across the region.
Fu though had to fight hard to reach the semi-finals on Wednesday after Hawkins, who knocked out five-times world champion Ronnie O'Sullivan in the previous round, launched a remarkable recovery from the seemingly hopeless position of 9-1 behind.
The 38-year-old Fu started well enough Wednesday when, resuming 7-1 up, he won the first two frames of the session, only for Hawkins to rally in style.But Fu, last a world semi-finalist in 2006, eventually held his nerve with a superb break of 74 -- in response to 60 from Hawkins -- in the 24th frame that saw him into the last four.
That has to be the best clearance of my life, said Fu. I was under a lot of pressure at the end and I couldn't really pot the last ball.
Some of the shots I played were were horrendous -- and I was choosing all the wrong shots. Under pressure, you can think a bit silly.
I almost threw it away, but luckily I made a good break at the end.
Meanwhile McManus, 45, reached his first world semi-final in 23 years after winning the last four frames of his all-Scottish clash with John Higgins as he too won 13-11. - AFP

None can divide SLFP  Sarath Ekanayake

No one will be able to splinter or divide the SLFP. All SLFPers will firmly stand behind the party leadership during the May Day Rally to be held in Galle, said Central Province Chief Minister Sarath Ekanayake.
He said the SLFP May Day Rally in Galle will give due recognition to the countrys working class.
Ekanayake expressed these views at a press conference at the Central Provincial Council premises recently.
Ekanayake said President Maithripala Sirisena has given due recognition to the working class by appointing a working class leader in the calibre of Leslie Devendra as the chairman of the SLFP May Day Rally organising committee.
He said the SLFP would march forward under the leadership of President by weathering all storms.
He said President Sirisena had steered the SLFP towards victory as the Party General Secretary for 17 years and had the ability to ensure the partys victory in future too.

SriLankan Airlines fund misuse : JO must reply to allegations: Bandara

UNP MP Nalin Bandara yesterday challenged the Joint Opposition members to reply to the allegations of heavily misusing the national carrier, SriLankan Airlines, over the past years leading to its current debt crisis.
He was speaking at a press conference at Sirikotha.
Bandara said the debt of SriLankan Airlines, which stands at Rs. 461 billion, was mainly due to political mishandling of the Rajapaksa government.
He said SriLankan Airlines was ruined under the management of Nishantha Wickremesinghe, a brother of the former First Lady.
The loss of this institution is unprecedented in our history. The debt of SriLankan Airlines alonge contributes to increase the per capita debt burden by Rs. 23,063. Now the Joint Opposition is spending lavishly to gather crowds for the May Day rally in Kirulapone. They accumulated this wealth by robbing public money. Most of the road development projects contained heavily inflated figures. We carry out the similar development projects for much lesser amounts, he said.
He also challenged NFF Leader and MP Wimal Weerawansa for an open debate over the statistics on road development work, without slinging mud at the government with distorted facts and figures.
Responding to a question by a journalist on a statement by a Chief Minister that the Galle May Day rally is against the government, the MP said there are certain lunatics among the Chief Ministers who do not conform with the good governance or National Government concept.
We urge the President to correct these lunatics, as otherwise they can do a lot of damage to this government, he said.
