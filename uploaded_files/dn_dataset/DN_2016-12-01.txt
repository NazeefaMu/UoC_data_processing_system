Article 3/2016 ...Respect and the Codeall for one!
Aloha and warm greetings to all those who still believe and are aggressive about their club succeeding, despite the state of our island economy and those decision makers, whom I rather think are avid followers of the code....
The game embraces us all, captures the imagination... demands specific management and new skill development for players and fans alike ... especially with the first timers, stepping up to the league.
It is pretty much a dream come true for these lads, just out from a fully loaded school season and hoping to hit the ground running .Expectations and anticipation pouring out of their years - as they try to match up to coach and club demands.
The pressure of the club league ...miles apart from the level and playing environment they are used to......settling down early is key to consistency and performance...Kevin Dixon, Omalka G, and T Ratwatte, Rehan Silva, Ashok Wijeykumar and Chatura Dilshan, good examples of the step up required to survive with those impact professionals, the requirement a lot more mental than physical, as they discover how best to survive on the club circuit.
Internationally the game is absolutely huge and quite relentless, the punishing season pretty much a global phenomenon. The mind wanders joyously around the Aviva premiership in England and the French reflection, its popularity defined by the fans packing the weekend matches. The game on both sides of the English channel decidedly in very good and sensible hands, has long been a shining example of pride and vision.
The story on the southern hemisphere platform is more impressive, Super Rugby carries remarkable pulling power and has set the pace for mega franchise rugby on a scale never experienced before. The modern format and live television has transformed the game for ever....giving fans the opportunity to support the growth and world status as the fastest growing sports discipline across both hemispheres.
The International Rugby Board ,,,certainly enjoying spectacular success, on many surprising levels...take the post World Cup frenzy for numbers and profit, they broke all records and redefined the level of corporate thinking. The Rugby World Club was a showcase tournament and epitomized the strength and vision of this great game....culminating quite neatly with the Olympic familys newest member ...Rugby 7s - and a roaring success of mega proportion, beautifully defined by Fiji winning the gold and stamping their 7s class across the continents.
The game and its code is policed and safe guarded by its laws ...but among us players, young and old ...there is a strict code of conduct and pleasing amounts of respect that epitomize the game and its fundamental principles.
As players we are nourished and nurtured on this respect from the time we learn to walk and pick up the odd shaped ball.....from hesitant steps as keen youngsters, to strong marauding warriors with big hearts that drive on pride and super human levels of performance fitness  Nadolo, the larger than life Fijian captain who carries his 125kg with much momentum, and the New Zealand winger 110kg Saveas impact finishing that intimidate all defenders to their core.
respect is the unwritten code that controls us individually and empowers the referee in the middle for the duration of both halves...Respect is our universal language of rugby, that ensures player safety in the air, in the sets, at the bottom of a ruck, flying down the blind side or as we dive full length to score over the line.
I believe that the players ability to function efficiently on controlled aggression is a stark and telling legacy of this remarkable game and the code of respect that governs us allboth on and off the pitch.
At home the Dialog league is just gaining speed and defining itself ...as team combinations sort themselves and fitness starts to bite in the last quarter especially. I am delighted to see the lads who played sevens, dominating with ball in hand and showing the value of extreme conditioning. National skipper Danushka Ranjan, Tarinda Ratwatte, Dulaj Perera, Richard Dharmapala, Kanchana Ramanayake, Sooriyabandara...exceptional skills combined with fitness, make each of them lethal finishers with ball in hand - little wonder that Ranjan 4 tries, is replaced by Dharmapala 5 tries as the top scorerboth Kandy players, specialists in every sense of the word and telling reputations not just here in Sri, but even more compelling Asiawide.
The league is just warming up and I do believe that the remaining matches will be as intense and aggressive as everyone imagines ...Havelocks currently leading the table on 23, and Navy just behind on 22, Kandy settling down on 19, CR looking for better form on 12 and the resurgent Air Force on 10, Army on 8.....with Police and CH still to get a point.
All this will turn and twist and change dramatically in the coming festive weeks...ignore the December chill as we wake and marvel at the heat in the pack as the biggest contenders confront each other in the middle.
Kandy certainly have some work to do ...and will definitely be the team to beat in the second round, both Navy and Havelocks will need all their petrol to secure those two slots at the top .
We get to lick our lips at the mouth watering prospects of seeing the best warriors run out against each other, over the month of December ...and what an Xmas it promises to be. I am hopeful that each club will make these big blockbuster matches, special occasions for fans and family to enjoy ...watch the absorbing impact action and skills in the middle , then the music, lights, entertainment plus, plus ...bring back those classic socials that made each club an oasis of colour and life each weekend.
Finally before I pack my pencil...a pleasant task of wishing an ardent and enthusiastic rugby heart Saabir Cader a safe step up to the goal line, as he gets married on Friday... and introduces his blushing bride to the game he has been living with for many seasons ...I trust his stag will be unique and less kit with all the traditional dancers ...clad in a few smiles!
Enjoy the step up islanders and try to predict your match ups. Cheers!

Kandy SC - a love affair with rugby
Defending league rugby champions Kandy Sports Club played with a slight difference in the opening rugby encounter of this season. But in actual fact there are no worries as with past experience this club since 1992 has been in the limelight tasting victory after victory.
Kandy SC has been playing inter-club rugby for well over 66 years since 1950. They achieved their best result in 1992, where they won the knockout for the first time. Today Kandy SC is a dominant power in Sri Lankan rugby and currently ranked third in this years SLRFU rugby league. The team has registered victories over CH & FC, Army SC, Police SC and lost to Air Force SC at Ratmalana which was a shocking defeat.
Kandy SC are blessed with the best squad in the country with extremely versatile players from the National squad. Out of the remaining games in the 1st Round League matches they have three vital matches two on their home ground.
Kandys head coach Sean Wijesinghe has wide experience, having captained the side twice, captained the National team and been an understudy to former coach Johan Taylor.
He has undergone rugby coaching training overseas with Level 1 & 2 certification.
Ably assisted by coach Nalaka Weerakody both being master strategist they should give the Kandy team the right guidance, inspiration, corrective surgery and iron out most of their weak points.
According to the Chairman Rugby Lasantha Wijesuriya the team will be at its full strength in the next three first round games against Navy SC, CR & FC and Havelock SC.
In their next game they are likely to field the same side that played against the Cops, but may make some positional changes to suit the game plan. The forwards will be strengthened to win good possession to feed the three quarters.
Every player is experienced and knowledgeable and should enjoy a very good season and come out with fine performance to help the side to emerge triumphant. On paper Kandy SC is the strongest team among the eight teams.
Since 1994 they have won the league title on 17 occasions (highest by a club) the last being 2015/16. This time they failed to maintain their unbeaten run in the rugby League and the remaining games they will look for a better performance to end the season with success like in previous years.

Sugathadasa synthetic running track tender: Rejected can appeal without blaming, says Sports Minister
Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara said it is unfair to level allegations against Sports Ministry tender board by the rejected Tender holders of Sugathadasa synthetic running track restoration, as they can appeal to the Procurement Authority at first, if the Tender Board has acted partially.
I inquired into the matter after I saw news paper articles exposed the rejected contractors side of the story. I do not know whether the tender board did their job correct. But if there is any misconduct, the grieved parties can appeal to the Procurement Authority. But instead, the rejected contractors made partial comments to the public media which I see unfair.
There were five competent applicants. Two or three of them were rejected in the initial round of the tender procedure due to lack of qualifications. Some of them have submitted incomplete applications. Actually I do not want to make statements on this. Because I must not make any interference with the tender procedure and also must avoid any unneseasory impact on the Boars functions. So I am not going to interfere this matter as the legal provisions are clear for any aggrieved party. We have a very transparent Government policy. So any aggrieved party also can appeal to the Procurement Authority at the Presidential Secretariat. I am answerable to the Cabinet. I have to submit tender procedures to the Cabinet. So we have to act according to the law, the Minister emphasized.
Minister also said the professor from the Moratuwa University who heads the tender board has a vast knowledge on the matter and the problems have arisen mainly due to incomplete applications.
The requirement of laying at least 10 IAAF (International Amateur Athletics Federation) approved class one tracks including a one in South Asia has been fulfilled by not just a one applicant but two or three. I have instructed the Tender Board to select the best and the Board took four months in preparation before the Tender was called to make sure everything is done correctly and transparently. I only want to select a contractor who will lay the track according to the highest standards. The Tender demands an insurance for the laying materiel and details with country name of the materiel. This is a high tech job and the contractor must have a thorough knowledge to do it right. If not, the moisture will cause water bubbles. So we have clearly stated that the contractor must submit us with a full report on how they are going to lay the track. We have given such specifications to make sure the task will be done to the highest standards, the Minister concluded.
