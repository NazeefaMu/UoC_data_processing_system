Child Friendly Police Station project launched
SriLankan Airlines and the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan have taken an important step forward in combating all forms of child abuse in Sri Lanka with the launch of the Child Friendly Police Station project, aimed at protecting child victims and bringing justice for their grievances.
Ajith Dias, Chairman of SriLankan Airlines, said, SriLankan Airlines believes that safeguarding childrens rights helps build strong, well-educated communities. There can be no matter of greater importance than the safety and welfare of our nations children.
The National Carrier is proud to once again fulfill its duties as a pillar of the nations corporate sector by engaging with the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan in this project to protect our children, though our CSR arm SriLankan Cares.
The programme envisages physically transforming police stations nationwide into centres of refuge where traumatized children would find a safe and comforting environment to go to and narrate their harrowing tales of abuse.
Pradeepa Kekulawala, Head of Human Resources at SriLankan who leads the airlines CSR efforts, added: Although Sri Lanka has made progress in some areas of promoting the rights and care of children, we believe that much more needs to be done.
The Child Friendly Police Station project is intended to assist the Sri Lankan Government in achieving its Agenda 2030 targets to end violence against children.
The pilot project will commence with the Ragama Police Station in a suburb north of the capital Colombo and the programme is envisaged to then be implemented in other police stations around the country.

Steering Committee interim report aggravating  situation
Parliamentarian Ven. Athuraliye Rathana Thera yesterday charged that the proposals made in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly are aggravating the situation instead of building reconciliation.
He said the proposals are completely contrary to the pledges made to the public by the Yahapalana government when it came to power.
He was speaking at a media conference held in Colombo organized by the National Council of Sri Lanka, with regard to the proposals made in the interim report of the Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly.
Ven Rathana Thera said these proposals will badly affect reconciliation and democracy. Even ordinary people belonging to minority groups do not agree with these proposals, he said.
"Introducing a new Constitution is not an urgent matter that the government should be addressing immediately. Before that, the government should fulfill the basic needs of the people," he said.
Only the people have the authority to form a State, not the government. Therefore, the Constitution making process should be based on the requirements of the public instead of the requirements of other countries.
The Steering Committee of the Constitutional Assembly claims that they have considered public views before drafting the proposals. If they did so they should have the ability to reveal how they did it. As those who played a key role in forming this government, they did not even consider our views on this, the Ven Thera charged.
By bringing this hot topic to the fore, the government is attempting to wipe all burning issues such as the SAITM and Central Bank Bond scam under the carpet.
University lecturer Dr. Suren Raghavan and Ceylon National Chamber of Industries (CNCI) former Chairman Tissa Seneviratne also addressed the occasion.

5 THINGS YOU'RE DOING  THAT MAKE  PEOPLE  DISLIKE YOU IMMEDIATELY
These are the top 5 things you're doing that make people dislike you immediately.
1. Sharing too many photos on social media.
Posting too many photos might alienate people, according to one study that looked at 508 Facebook users. Posting too many family photos may alienate friends and posting too many photos of friends may alienate family. So, keep some photos to yourself.
2. Name-dropping
One study had people name drop tennis pro Roger Federer in emails. The more they stressed their association with Federer, the less liked they were by their colleague. Participants said the emails sounded manipulative.
3. Humblebragging
Most people do this in job interviews, saying things like "I work too hard" or "I care too much". A Harvard study shows that will hurt your odds of getting hired. Instead, state a real weakness that isn't a deal breaker.
4. Hiding your emotions
Researchers showed students two different videos of an actor's face. The actor would either show emotion or remain emotionless, while they watched funny or sad scenes from a movie. Students rated the emotive actor much higher in likeability.
5. Not smiling
A study took 100 students and showed them photos of people posing. Researchers found no matter how the person in the photo posed, people liked them most if they were smiling.
A different study found that smiling made you more memorable, after meeting someone for the first time.
Of course, simply not being a jerk couldn't hurt either!

ARCHITECTURE OF REVERENCE
The Dalada Maligawa or the Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic is located in the Royal Palace complex in Kandy. It houses the relic of the tooth of the Buddha. In ancient times, until the British occupation of Sri Lanka, it had awesome power, since it was thought that whoever holds the relic will rule the country. The Daily News speaks to emeritus professor of Architecture University Moratuwa, Prof. Nimal De Silva on the Dalada Maligawa once the seat of power in Sri Lanka.
Apart from being a destination that is frequented visited by locals and foreigners, even today the temple still has religious power with religious ceremonies being conducted by the Bhikkus.
Temple of the Tooth Relic consists of three main buildings. They are the Vedahitina Maligava, Pattirippuwa and Aluth Maligawa.
During the reign of King Sri Wickrama Rajasingha, (1798  1815 A.D) the front section with the Pattirippuwa (Octagon) was built by Devendra Moolacarya, the Architect. The king was supposed to have addressed the people from this building. This building a master-piece of Kandyan Architecture. It is considered as the symbol of identity of the Kandyan Architecture and was built in 1802 A.D. Out of his construction Magul Maduwa/audience hall or the pavilion held a prominent place.

The carvings of the wooden pillars which support the wooden roof are an example of wood carving of the Kandyan period. Sri Rajadhi Rajasinha of Kandy built it in 1783. Originally the hall was 58 by 35.6 feet (17.7 m  10.9 m). After renovation, its length was extended by an additional 31.6 feet (9.6 m). Other nearby building to the halls believed to be demolished during the British rule. That space was later used to erect the Kandy Kachcheri and Kandy Supreme Court. Today it is used for state ceremonies and conserved under the department of archaeology.
Another view of the inside of the palace
What we see today is not the Dalada Maligawa where the King lived centuries ago. All the two storey buildings are new additions. Only the Vadahitina Maligava was two storey. It is in the center where the relic is kept. At that time it was the only two storey building. All the others were single storey. This architecture is unique. Nowhere in the world do you find this form, said De Silva.
Kandyan architectural style
The main entrance gate which lies over the moat is called Mahawahalkada. At the foot of Mahawahalkada steps there is a Sandakada Pahana (moonstone) which is carved in Kandyan architectural style. Elephants are depicted in stone on the either sides of the entrance. A Makara Torana and two guardian stones are placed on top of the staircase.
In 1998, the LTTE attacked the temple, but they were not able to take the bomb inside. The bomb was blasted outside near the gate. Mahawahalkada was totally destroyed in the bomb blast and rebuilt afterwards along with Sandakada Pahana and other stone carvings, said De Silva.
The entrance to the temple complex is through the Mahawahalkada. There are two walls on the sides of the Wahalkada. The outer wall is called Walakulu Bamma (wall of clouds). This same pattern is also used in the wall surrounding the Kandy Lake. The inner wall is called Diyareli Bamma (wall of water ripples). Both these walls are built with holes to place oil lanterns during the night.
Symbol of great power
The tooth relic was a symbol of great power for the Royalty of this country. The one who possessed the tooth relic was the king of Sri Lanka. So therefore it was guarded and worshipped. It was the palladium of kingship.
The Maligawa was originally established in Kotte. The tooth relic was brought during the time of King Vimaladharmasuriya I. The Portuguese attacked the Kotte kingdom. Before that the tooth relic was taken out from where it was kept and hidden. Finally when King Vimaladharmasuriya I took over Kandy, the tooth relic was handed over to him, said De Silva.
Doorway to the temple
From the time it was brought in, the Perahera were rituals conducted by the King to show his people that he controlled and held the tooth relic. Even up to now the Perahera is continued in that form. If there was turbulence in the Royal Family, the member that possesses the tooth relic is suitable to be king, explained De Silva.
It was the king who performed all the rituals connected to the tooth relic. It was Diyawadana Rala who helped the king whilst the King performed everything. So later when the king was not there it became a Nilame and now it goes as Diyawadana Nilame.
Prof. Nimal De Silva
The golden canopy over the main shrine, built in 1987 by Prime Minister Ranasinghe Premadasa, and the golden fence which encircles the main shrine are other notable features. The tooth relic is encased in seven golden caskets which engraved with precious gemstones. The caskets have a shape of a stupa. The procession casket which is used during the Kandy Esala Perahera is also displayed in the same chamber. All caskets are in the Vadahitina Maligawa. The doors of the Vadahitina Maligawa are carved in ivory. The actual chamber which the tooth relic is kept is known as the Handun Kunam,he added.

Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple
Blissful path
A short distance away from the noisy life of the city, the proud landmark in Melbourne, Victoria, is the Keysborough Dhamma Sarana temple. Nestled amidst a calm and serene locality with its great surroundings providing the backdrop to the establishment of this sacred venue, it is a perfect location for Buddhist activities. It reflects how the splendour of the spot has entered into the setting up of this great institution.
Keysborough temple of ten referred to as Dhamma Sarana Viharaya fulfilling a timely need of the Buddhists in the area culminating in a religious awakening in a foreign land. It is truly a sight prone to Buddha Dhamma.
It is this Buddhist atmosphere and serenity that has been highlighted throughout the sacred venue and it has grown in popularity as a sacred destination for those living in Melbourne as well as Australia. Buddhists in an around the sacred premises take much pride as it is today an impressive place of religious cultural and educational value of great significance.
The beauty of the temple for the Buddhists lay in its layout and management. Now to the temple premises. It has a multitude of buildings all the requisites of a temple. As you enter on your right is the solidly constructed Dharma shala replete with a very spacious hall for the comfort of the devotees in their monthly Sil campaigns discussions and other religious events. As you proceed inwards right in front is the serene Buddha statue for you to worship and gain merit. Few steps away is the initially built residence for monks. Further inside there is the Dhana shala where the laity could freely use for the offerings. Here the temple almsgivings are performed perfectly fine, by the laity under the guidance of the resident monks.
After the Dharmanu sasana (Buddhist sermon) finally there is provision for the laity to share the aftermath of the Dhana (meal). Another attraction to be appreciated are the facilities provided for the disabled on aside at the entrance a rare feature in Sri Lankan temples.
Then outside pristine clear lush green rolling lawns set the scene with multi-coloured flora adding charm and beauty to the entire premises.
On your right Bhodiya with its out spreading branches is the ideal place for the devotees to perform their Bodhi Poojas. The glittering stupa (Chaitya) found in the centre is a beautiful addition to the sacred site.
Mention has to be made of the best Dhamma School in Melbourne renowned for its high standards in religious education and discipline. The contribution made to the younger generation, the young readers interested in learning Dhamma to get the true taste of Buddhism is beyond expression.
All these make the temple premises a marvellous structure. The entire temple complex conveys the Buddhas message and this is a perfect religious place providing all amenities. The temple as a whole is a clear indication of the vision and religious enthusiasm of the Chief Incumbent Venerable Naotunne Vijitha Thera who has also been awarded the title of Chief Sangha Nayaka of Australia.
He along with his other resident monks and volunteers actively participates in welfare activities to help the deserving and the needy.
They tirelessly helped the Sri Lankan victims during the Tsunami and also of the recent floods and various other calamities. Another noble task frequently carried out by the Monks is the rescuing of cattle from slaughter.
The Nayaka Thera is a reputed preacher not only here but also across the globe. His service to the Sri Lankan Buddhist Community of Melbourne in participating in their most important occasions like house warming Pirith and Dhana etc cannot be appreciated enough. In conclusion, much of the spiritual progress and prosperity of the Melbourne Sri Lankan Buddhist Community could be attributed to the dedication of the Maha Nayaka Thera and the resident Sangha.

Case against Prasanna Ranatunga postponed for the fifth occasion

The case filed against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife was today postponed for trial by Colombo High Court for the fifth consecutive occasion.
When the case came up before Colombo Chief High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke, the Court re-fixed the case for trial to be heard on February 14 citing that the Court has assigned time for another trial.
At the previous occasion (August 23), defence counsel sought a new trial date citing that his client wants to attend parliament sessions.
This case had been fixed for trial on five occasions (October 7 last year, January 26 this year, May 23 this year, August 23 this year and October 26) for various reasons.
When the case was taken up for trial today the key witnesses virtual complainant and his wife were present in court. The first and second witnesses were advised to appear in Court next trial date.
Meanwhile, the High Court today permitted Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife Maureen Ranatunga to go abroad (Australia) between December 10 and December 22 for a period of three weeks.
The Attorney General (AG) had filed indictments against former Western Province Chief Minister Prasanna Ranatunga, his wife Maureen Ranatunga and another person on the charge of threatening a businessman over the phone and demanding Rs.64 million.
At a previous occasion, Colombo High Court decided to proceed the trial against Gampaha District Parliamentarian Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife in absentia of third accused Naresh Kumar Fareek who was evading courts from the beginning of investigations.
MP Prasanna Ranatunga and his wife are currently out on bail.
The Attorney General filed indictments on 15 counts against three accused Prasanna Ranatunga, Maureen Ranatunga and Naresh Kumar Fareek based on charges of committing offences during the period between April 6, 2015 and June 2, 2015.
In addition, the AG has named 65 witnesses and included 35 articles as Courts productions against three accused in this case. The prosecutors maintained that businessman Gehard Mendis who purchased a 2.5 acre land in Meethotamulla sometime back had allegedly requested the former Chief Minister to evacuate the unlawful occupants of that land and fill it with soil.
The prosecutors alleged that the former Chief Ministers wife along with two others had entered into an agreement with the businessman and the latter had already paid Rs.15 million to the former for the services.
Mendis had lodged a complaint with FCID saying that the former Chief Minister had threatened him over the phone demanding the rest of the money involved in a promised deal.
The prosecution maintained that the investigations have revealed that the accused had misappropriated Rs.15 million and the voice recordings of the alleged incident had been listed as a production item.
Deputy Solicitor General Thusith Mudalige appeared for the Attorney General. Presidents Counsel Anil Silva appeared for the accused.

The case of pending consensus
Hopes that the proposed new Constitution will be a unifying factor in Sri Lanka as it emerges after three decades of war and nearly a decade of relative peace receded this week, with the opposition indicating that they have no qualms about using the proposed reforms as a political weapon.
At the outset, it is worthwhile emphasising that, as Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has painstakingly pointed out many times, there is no new Constitution as such, right now. What has become the topic of much discussion and dispute is the Interim Report of the Parliamentary Steering Committee appointed for the purpose of studying a proposed new Constitution.
The report makes it clear that no final decision has been reached on several contentious issues such as the unitary status of the country, the status accorded to Buddhism, the unit of devolution of power, potential for merging two provinces and the role of the President. In fact, the report sets out the different options for each of these issues as a basis for further discussion.
Moreover, the report itself consists of only 26 pages but there are eight annexures from seven political parties and Dr. Jayampathy Wickramaratne totalling 66 pages. This confirms not only that there is still a significant diversity of opinion regarding the proposed Constitution but also that the interim report is far from being a fait accompli.
Even a cursory glance at the proposals of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) reveals that there are major differences of opinion between the SLFP and its partner in the government of National Unity, the United National Party (UNP) and that it will take many more rounds of negotiation to reach a compromise - a compromise that would be necessary because the two major parties need to agree on the proposed reforms if it is to have any chance of being approved in Parliament with a two-thirds majority.
For instance, with regard to the Executive Presidency, the interim reports notes that, there was general consensus that the Executive Presidency as it exists today, be abolished and that the President should be elected by Parliament for a fixed term of office.
Executive Presidency
The SLFP has opted to disagree. In its observations, the party states that: the opinion of the SLFP is that complete abolition of the Executive Presidency that is present today is not prudent. Considering various terrorist and extremist activities that happen in various countries in the world, the SLFP believes a President should be elected directly from the public mandate with a certain amount of powers to protect the unitary status of the country and to keep and to protect the stability of the country specially in a situation where a large volume of power is granted to the Provincial Councils.
It justifies its stance saying that thereby every ethnic group of the country without narrow ethnic, religious problems gets political power by selecting a president and gets the opportunity to become a member of the presidential election process, and hence, it becomes a practical method for national reconciliation.
This is obviously at variance with the general consensus noted in the interim report as well as the observations of Dr. Wickramaratne, the only UNP parliamentarian to submit his own observations. Dr. Wickramaratne has noted that he endorses the the abolition of the Executive Presidential system of Government and suggests that the President should be elected by an Electoral College consisting of Members of Parliament and the (proposed) Second Chamber.
It is relevant to note that the SLFPs stance is also at variance with President Maithripala Sirisena himself who based his election campaign on the late Venerable Maduluwave Sobhitha Theras rallying cry for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. After his election and at Venerable Sobhitha Theras funeral, the President has re-iterated his pledge several times. To be fair by the President, he has never stated that he wishes to run again for President, although some of his party stalwarts urge him to do so and publicly proclaim him as the next SLFP candidate.
However, the Joint Opposition (JO) in particular has attempted to hijack the debate on the proposed reforms portraying them as a betrayal of the country, the majority community and Buddhism. They have now embarked on a propaganda campaign, the objective of which is to gain political mileage using the proposed constitutional reforms as a convenient scapegoat.
New Constitution
The issue escalated last week when, on Wednesday, the Karaka Maha Sangha Sabha of the Asgiriya and Malwatte met and thereafter issued a statement to the effect that a new Constitution was not necessary. Some print and electronic media outlets gave this statement wide publicity, leading to a perception that the Buddhist clergy was categorically opposed to the process of constitutional reform.
On Thursday, it was Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe who threw the gauntlet at the media, calling a media conference and challenging editors to prove their claims. Prime Minister Wickremesinghe was to say that he had spoken to the Mahanayake of the Malwatte Chapter, Ven Thibbotuwave Sri Sumangala Thera and found that the Thera was overseas. The Mahanayake Thera had assured the Prime Minister that he had expressed no sentiments to suggest that constitutional reform was not necessary.
In fact, when JO stalwart Dinesh Gunawardena had met him a few weeks ago, the Mahanayake Thera had reassured Gunawardena that he was satisfied with the assurances provided by both President Sirisena and Prime Minister Wickremesinghe.
That has not deterred the JO. In fact, Viyathmaga, an organisation of professionals linked to the JO and to former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa conducted a meeting on Saturday where retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne insisted that the traitors who attempt to divide the country by introducing a new constitution must be killed. Rajapaksa was chairing the meeting when these remarks were made. It is this kind of inflammatory rhetoric that is singularly unproductive in what should be an intelligent debate.
Despite evidence that there clearly is a politically motivated campaign to sway the opinion of the Buddhist clergy against the proposed constitutional reforms which are still in the discussion stage, it is clear the government has much work to do in terms of educating not only the Buddhist clergy but also the general public on the process of constitutional reform.
This was apparent when the Chief Incumbent of the Bellanvila Raja Maha Vihara, Venerable Dr. Bellanvila Wimalaratne Thera also declared that a new Constitution was not the need of the hour. Expressing concerns that the proposed reforms may lead to federalism, Venerable Dr Wimalaratne Thera stated that he would urge the President and the Prime Minister to stop the reform process.
National Unity government
The government thus finds itself in a challenging situation. There is no denying that President Maithripala Sirisena was elected on a platform of reforming the Executive Presidency and as such, he has a mandate for that, received from a majority of voters who were growing wary and weary of an executive presidential system rapidly converting itself into an oligarchy beholden to a single family. However, in trying to fulfil that pledge, he and his government are now facing obstacles.
If there was a mandate from the masses two years ago, that wouldnt have suddenly disappeared into thin air and the government has a responsibility to honour that mandate.
Therefore, the need of the hour is not a clarion call to stop the constitutional reform process. Instead, it is to have intelligent discussion and debate and arrive at a rational and reasonable middle ground that would be acceptable to all communities and religious groups in the country.
This is the challenge that the government faces-and this issue, more than any other issue, underscores the importance of the National Unity government. With both major parties working together and with a two-thirds majority in Parliament, its highest priority objective should be to usher in a new Constitution in accordance with the promise it made to the Sri Lankan voter two years ago.

Clarification
Attorney-at-Law Shanika Abeywickrama in a letter to the Daily News clarified the news item titled Illegally Obtaining Electricity-Case Against Former LITRO GAS Chairman, carried on the October 17, 2017 Daily News issue.
The letter: I write on the instructions of my client Mr. Shalila Moonasinghe of Etulkotte. I am instructed that the aforesaid heading in the said article is defamatory per se and by innuendo and I am instructed that the said heading in the said article which attempt to portrait through the heading is absolutely false and distortion of the truth. The electricity meter fixed at the premises at No.941/12B, 6th Lane Ethulkotte had been faulty on many instances and therefore many complaints were made to LECO by my client, the tenants that occupied the said premises and also the meter reader.
First of such complaints was in the year 2010 by the tent of my client, who was occupying the said premises in the year 2009 and 2010 and responding to above complaint, the technicians of LECO had examined the said meter and even a test meter had been fixed consequent to the said inspection.
Thereafter, in November 2013, the Meter Reader and my client both made complaints regarding a fault in the meter.
Responding to the above complaints, a team of technicians of LECO had visited the said premises and the said technicians after an examination of the said meter had been of the view that the said meter is in order.
However, my client and the meter reader had not been satisfied with the said finding since the meter had been functioning properly and therefore further complaints had been made my client and the meter reader regarding the meter and the bills. Therefore, another team of technicians have visited the said premises in February 2014 and thereafter examining the meter had alleged that my client has tempered with the wiring of the meter but the documents issued by both the teams of technicians that visited the said premises in November 2013 and February 2014 clearly indicate that the seal of LECO in the said meter are intact. Despite the above, LECO together with the Welikada police proceeded to institute action in the Magistrates court of Colombo against my client is contesting as he has done no wrong and is in possession of evidence to prove that the allegations are false.

The Dark      Side
Dealing with jealousy

Recognize your jealousy
When we name the jealousy, it loses its power, because we are no longer letting it shame us, says Christina Hibbert, a clinical psychologist. Acknowledging that youre jealous opens the door to learning.
Learn from your jealousy.
We can use feelings of jealousy as inspiration to grow. For instance, you realize that the reason you get jealous every time your friend plays her guitar is because thats also something youd like to do. Rather than wallowing in that jealousy, you sign up for guitar lessons.
Let it go.
Tell yourself that you dont need this emotion in your life. Then breathe deeply, and imagine it flowing through you like the wind. Repeat as often as it takes to truly let it go.
Manage your emotions
Practice mindfulness to calm your runaway emotions. If your jealousy involves your romantic relationship, share your feelings with your partner after you calm down
Remind yourself of your positive traits.
Hibbert gives this example: She is really good at playing with her kids, and Im not so good. But Im great at reading to them, and they love that about me. This reminds us that everyone has strengths and weaknesses.
Jealousy is a normal reaction. It becomes problematic when it becomes persistent. When you find yourself feeling jealous, recognize whats happening and delve deeper into your relationships and yourself.
We all get jealous, dont we I think if we are honest with ourselves, the answer is yes  Sylvia Plath's confession applies to all of us, I am jealous of those who think more deeply, who write better, who draw better, who ski better, who look better, who live better, who love better than I.
David M. Buss calls it the darker side of human nature. In 'The Dangerous Passion' he writes, The drives that stir us out of bed at dawn and hurl us headlong into our daily struggles have two sides. On the positive side, passions inspire us to achieve life's goals. They impel us to satisfy our desire for companionship, our yearning for prestige, and our quest for love. The dazzling plays of Shakespeare, the mesmerizing art of Georgia O'Keeffe, and the brilliant inventions of Thomas Edison would not exist if passion had not stirred them from repose and impelled creation. Without passion, we would lie listless in bed, for there would be no motivation to do anything at all.
But passions carry a darker, more sinister side. The same passions that inspire us with love can lead to the disastrous choice of a mate, or the desperation of unrequited obsession. The yearning for prestige can produce exhilarating peaks of power while evoking the corrosive envy of a rival and a fall from a greater height.
Shakespeare called it the green monster. According to Boris Sokoloff, in Jealousy: A Psychological Study, Jealousy is not only inbred in human nature, but it is the most basic, all-pervasive emotion which touches man in all aspects of every human relationship.
Therapists, however, regard this demon as a scar of childhood trauma or a symptom of a psychological problem. And it's true that people who feel inadequate, insecure, or overly dependent tend to be more jealous than others. But the "monster" actually evolved for positive reasons. "A little bit of jealousy in a healthy relationship is fine," says biological anthropologist Helen Fisher, Ph.D., author of "Why We Love." "It's going to wake you up. When you are reminded that your mate is attractive and that you are lucky, it can stimulate you to be nicer [and] friendlier."
Explaining further, she says, Throughout our primordial past this monster discouraged desertion by a mate, bolstering the family unit and enabling the survival of the young. At the same time, it has pushed us to abandon philanderersand many a futile matchin favor of more stable and rewarding partnerships. Jealousy can even be good for love. One partner may feel secretly flattered when the other is mildly jealous. And catching someone flirting with your beloved can spark the kind of romance that reignites a relationship.
So, the problem with jealousy, isnt that it comes up from time to time, but what it does to us when we dont get a hold on it. It can be frightening to experience what happens when we allow our jealousy to overpower us or to shape the way we feel about ourselves and the world around us. That is why understanding where our jealous feelings actually come from and learning how to deal with jealousy in healthy, adaptive ways is key to so many areas of our lives from our interpersonal relationships to our careers to our personal goals.
The strange thing is, experts say while it may feel pointless or illogical, it is completely natural to want what others have and to feel competitive. However, how we use these feelings is very important to our level of satisfaction and happiness. If we use these feelings to serve our inner critic, to tear down ourselves or others, that is clearly a destructive pattern with demoralizing effects. However, if we dont let these feelings fall into the hands of our critical inner voice, we can actually use them to acknowledge what we want, to be more goal-directed or even to feel more accepting of ourselves and what affects us.
In other words, its okay, even healthy, to allow ourselves to have a competitive thought. It can feel good when we simply let ourselves have the momentary feeling without judgment or a plan for action. However, if we ruminate or twist this thought into a criticism of ourselves or an attack on another person, we wind up getting hurt.
The good news is if we do find ourselves having an overreaction or feeling haunted by our feelings of envy, there are steps we can take to cure ourselves of it. When we feel jealous, we should do what Daniel Siegel uses to describe how we can sift through the sensations, images, feelings and thoughts (SIFT) that come up when we reflect on certain issues in our lives. We can consider what sensations, images, feelings and thoughts jealousy brings up. Does the current scenario trigger something old  a family dynamic or long-held, negative self-perception The more we can connect these emotions or overreactions to the past events that created them in the first place, the clearer we can feel in our present-day situation.
Moreover, no matter how jealous we feel, we should find ways to come back to ourselves and soften. Therapists say we can do this by first, accepting our emotions with compassion. Remember that no matter how strong we feel, our feelings tend to pass in waves, first building, then subsiding. Its possible to accept and acknowledge our jealousy without acting on it. We can master the skills to calm ourselves down before reacting, for example, by taking a walk or a series of deep breaths. When we do so, we can stand up for ourselves and the people we care for without letting anyone get hurt.
Another negative side of jealousy is that once it spirals us into a state of jealousy, our inner self may also tell us to give up or stop going after what we want. It may lead us to sabotage, blow up at or punish someone we respect. If were in a relationship, it may tell us to lash out at our partner. When we do this, all we do is create the dynamic were afraid of. We may hurt and undermine our partners loving feelings for us and stir up their own feelings of distrust and fear. We may inadvertently encourage them to become more closed off, less open about their feelings, thoughts and actions, which then adds to our feelings of distrust and jealousy.
Experts say when this happens the best thing we can do is focus on feeling strong and secure in ourselves. We have to believe that we are okay, even on our own. We dont need one specific persons love to believe were lovable. Human beings are full of flaws and limitations, and no one can give us what we need 100 percent of the time. This is why its so important to practice self-compassion and learn to stand up to our own inner critic. This doesnt mean shutting people out or shutting ourselves off from what we want. It actually means embracing our lives wholeheartedly, while believing that were strong enough to fail or lose. No matter what, we can handle the emotions that arise.
The bottom line, then, is to keep in mind what Shakespeare wrote in Othello. O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
It is the green-eyed monster, which doth mock, The meat it feeds on. And you will be fine.

Deepavali celebrated at  Permanent Mission of  Sri Lanka to UN in New York
The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York hosted a Deepavali celebration on Saturday, October 21, at its premises. The event brought together members of Sri Lankas Hindu community and those of different faiths in the Tri-State area as well as representatives from other Permanent Missions including the Permanent Representative of Mauritius and the Deputy Permanent Representatives of India and Nepal.
The event commenced with the traditional lighting of the oil lamp and included reading of Deepavali messages of President Maithripala Sirisena, and Prime Minister Ranil Wickramasinghe, Hindu religious and cultural programmes and a speech by the Permanent Representative.
M. R. Ravi Vaidyanant Sivachariar, from the Hindu temple in Queens, outlined the significance of Deepavali, and conducted a Hindu religious observance. He said that Deepavali, which means row of lights honours light in order to celebrate wisdom, goodness, and enlightenment.
He also explained the significance of Deepavali in the context of worshiping the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi and recited Hindu Shlokas about the Goddess and peace, in Sanskrit with an English translation. Ambassador and Permanent Representative Dr. Rohan Perera said that with the significant Hindu community in Sri Lanka, the festival is given a special place in the country, and that it is celebrated as an important national festivity.
Acknowledging the festivals significance as a celebration of light, he said that in Hindu culture, as in other cultures of Sri Lanka, light is a powerful metaphor for knowledge and consciousness.
He also said that lighting lamps reminds one to dispel darkness from their lives, and to embrace knowledge and goodness, including respecting and valuing others. Dr. Perera said that the path towards lasting peace lies only in consistently celebrating the beauty of the diversity of all communities.
He called for the fostering of a culture of genuine respect for and appreciation of the plurality of Sri Lanka and the world, which allows for the celebration of different religious, ethnic and cultural commonalities. A traditional Bharatha Nattyam, was performed by a leading Sri Lankan expatriate dance and yoga guru, Natya Ratna Calai Chandrasekaram, The evening concluded with the partaking of a traditional vegetarian dinner by all guests.

Devapriya on SLFP party organisers
Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya said that senior SLFPers are discussing whether it is possible to reinstate party organisers who were removed and offer them the opportunity to contest the upcoming Local Government election through the SLFP.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said the SLFPs stance is that Sri Lanka should remain a unitary country. We agreed with the proposal of devolving more powers to Provincial Councils, but we are against any merger of Provincial Councils.
The Governors should be appointed in consultation with Chief Ministers and they(Governors) should not be limited to ceremonial activities in the area, he said.
The President should remain as the head of Cabinet while retaining all the powers regarding the defence.
Devapriya further said that several communal minded politicians are trying to misguide the people and the Maha Sangha by distorting facts of the statment made by the Mahanayake Theras of the Malwathu-Asgiriya Chapters.
Our stance is that the new Constitution should only please Sri Lankans from the North to the South and not the Tamil Diaspora. The President is also of the view that there should not be a referendum.
He added that that President will resolve the SAITM issue once he returns to the country.

Electric cars emit 50% less greenhouse gas than diesel, study finds

Electric cars emit significantly less greenhouse gases over their lifetimes than diesel engines even when they are powered by the most carbon intensive energy, a new report has found.
In Poland, which uses high volumes of coal, electric vehicles produced a quarter less emissions than diesels when put through a full lifecycle modelling study by BelgiumsVUB University.
CO2 reductions on Europes cleanest grid in Sweden were a remarkable 85%, falling to around one half for countries such as the UK.
On average, electric vehicles will emit half the CO2 emissions of a diesel car by 2030, including the manufacturing emissions, said Yoann Le Petit, a spokesman for the T&E think tank, which commissioned the study.
Weve been facing a lot of fake news in the past year about electrification put out by the fuel industry but in this study you can see that even in Poland today it is more beneficial to the climate to drive an electric vehicle than a diesel.
The new study uses an EU estimate of Polands emissions  at 650gCO2/kWh  which is significantly lower thancalculations by the European commissions Joint Research Centrescience wing last year.
But its findings will likely be welcomed in Brussels, where a new emissions standard for 2030 is set to be unveiled in November, along with some potentially more radical proposals.
Speaking in the European parliament this month, the EUs climate commissioner, Miguel Canete, said: One option were looking at is a mandate to ensure a minimum share of low  for manufacturers it could be zero  emitting vehicles.
Today, just 1.7% of new vehicles sold in Europe are electric, and some EU officials question whether Europe has access to enough lithium to create a 5-10% market share for electric cars anytime soon. Its capacity to scale up construction of battery plants may also be in doubt.
You cant have a massive explosion of electric cars as theres no plants here to build the batteries, one EU source said. In any case, when you take into account the emissions from battery manufacture and electricity supply, their GHG emissions are not so attractive.
The VUB study says that while the supply of critical metals  lithium, cobalt, nickel and graphite  and rare earths would have to be closely monitored and diversified, it should not constrain the clean transport transition.
As battery technology improves and more renewables enter the electricity grid, emissions from battery production itself could be cut by 65%, the study found.

Empowering the  underpowered
President Ranasinghe Premadasa was a do-gooder. The fullness of his heart made him to think much of a programme to uplift the living conditions of the down-and-out. The Poverty Alleviation Programme designated Janasaviya was the brainwave of this great humanist in addition to the housing programme and the 200 Garment Factories Programme for them at their doorsteps. Janasaviya, the first of its kind conceptualized in a welfare state meant specifically to uplift the sustentation of the destitute, the people who lived a hand-to-mouth life with no permanent source of income. Initiated with funds from the exchequer deposited in the bank accounts of the people found to be eligible to receive a grant from the state, it was carried into effect from October 1989, a blessing disguise to the necessitous. The summum bonum of this benefactor occupying a warm corner in the hearts of the beneficiaries will certainly last ad infinitum.
Along with the tergiversation of Solomon West Ridgeway Dias Bandaranaike and his termination of relations with the United National Party owing to party line differences, a collision course erupted between both parties along with his departure. It rooted deeply to a rivalry that it has come a long way both parties never agreeing with each other on any matter, even at this moment, they are at cross purposes, when a memorandum of understanding has been signed and a consensus government has been formed in amalgamation, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party divided against itself shows its disinclination to be with the United National Party when it is wholeheartedly willing to continue. We hear only of trading insults on each other, disagreements, disputes and tug-of-wars as antagonists in fulmination.
The continuance of this obnoxious attitude is against the will of the people as they have not objected to forming a consensus government. When the extreme and urgent need of the country is unity and when the northerners and the Leader of the Opposition Rajavarodayam Sampanthan too have expressed satisfaction and happiness about the draft constitution presented, this behaviour of a minority is not exemplary. Its time for them to think of the epigram If you cant beat them, join them.
The war-weary people (during approximately three decades of war) are interested in unity, peace, harmony and prosperity not in elections every now and then at their expense at a time they struggle without being able to make ends meet resultant to exorbitant costs of living. If they cooperate shedding differences at this crucial hour, not only the countrymen, the whole world will be appreciative of their goodwill especially of the 193 nations who are in great determination to seeking a solution to the dispute and disunity in Sri Lanka.
The United National Party comprising the high-minded in its structure did not struggle for power by means of over throwing governments by unruly or unjustifiable means, instead, its leadership always had a professional approach to all matters pertaining to the general administration of the country but, at the fullness of time its onrush to fight battles could not be prevented by any sources like the one it fought in 2015.
The Gal Oya Valley development and Settlement Scheme, River Valleys Development Project, diversion of the Mahaweli River to the north, Mahaweli acceleration programme, the National Youth Council, Housing (Uda Gam) Projects and the Two Hundred Garment Factory Programme are upstanding conspicuously inter alia to-date to its credit as work done for the country. Another one such mighty creation was the Poverty Alleviation Programme. At this juncture, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party in the opposition felt that it was outdistanced and outflanked by the implementation of the undreamed Poverty Alleviation Programme to hearten the needy and ipso facto the sequential upturn of the United National Party. This added to further deepen the animosity, rivalry and overspread jealousy towards the United National Party existed at that time.
Magnificent inventions
With the untimely demise of President Premadasa on May 01, 1993 and the defeat of President Dingiri Banda Wijetunga at the presidential election in 1994, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party took reins of government under President Chandrika Bandaranaike. The first and foremost step it took was to make an amendment to delete Janasaviya to insert Samurdhi as their version studiedly carried out to underestimate the U.N.P. and arouse the interest of the populace to Samurdhi, the neologism, and, built up a fallacy to interpret that it was one of their magnificent inventions.
As this change was done with an ulterior motive, Samurdhi since then became a haywire and, at last, when misappropriation of Samurdhi funds consequent to negligence was detected and elements were brought to book, the administration of Samurdhi thereafter malfunctioned and deteriorated to the lowest level leading to corrupt, undignified and inhuman practices.
Majority of the beneficiaries of this welfare organisation are sexagenarians, septuagenarians and octogenarians who are weaklings owing to ageing, disheartened owing to financial hardships, suffering from various sicknesses and continue to be so owing to non-availability of medical care, malnutrition owing to lack of food, hard of hearing, lack of vision and above all, they suffer in silence owing to childrens negligence at the last stage. And, among them are disabled and differently able ones and invalids, those who cannot read and write, those ignorant of procedures and formalities to be followed in offices.
They usually wend their way to this office tiresomely in sweaty clothes having walked considerable destinations with empty stomachs with the hope of having a square meal at least, on the day they receive the smidgen but, owing to the rude inhumane conduct of the men and women installed in it, they return with shattered hopes when payment is refused or told to come on another day. I am personally aware of this situation since I have been an observer of activities of a couple of Samurdhi Offices in Colombo North for several years. Not only this, there are more things to be revealed to substantiate the use of authority arrogantly.
Elderly people are called Senior Citizens. They are a class of people who should be treated with kindness and dignified by respecting them. They are expected to be venerated by their siblings. Though these stooges of politicians installed in these offices as white- collar workers are expected to receive them with deference and accommodate comfortably, they manhandle them. The truth is they are thrown from pillar to post and sent back and forth whenever they go to receive their monthly grant, make a claim or an enquiry. Nothing is done without this persecution and harassment.
The followings are some of the dialogues I have overheard. you come Thursday, Miss has not come today says a woman on Monday and, when the beneficiary come on Thursday you come on Monday. Miss has not come is another say. On Monday they say we have to calculate your accounts, leave the book and go, come next week. When the beneficiary come next week, they ask for the book. When they say we gave the books to you last Monday then they say, we have to search for those. To some of them they say the book is not with us. Then they have to apply with affidavits to have new books. They receive new books with new accounts.
In one womans house there were a large number of books so retained. No receipts are issued for monies they collect from them. Preferential treatment is available to those beneficiaries who bring cakes and prepare tea in these offices and attend to their various other needs. This is an extract from a letter a Divineguma recipient wrote to the Divineguma Director General in 2015.
Poorest of the poor
We members of this office have to bring to your notice that the staff in it are a cruel lot to the poorest of the poor who go to them for their needs. This office is not been administered by any responsible officer although there is a woman inside a cubicle. She is only a showroom dummy good for window shoppers. They are unpunctual. Seats are often deserted and never they arrive on schedule and they leave before the time they should sign of. Nobody is aware of the whereabouts of these people whenever we enquire.
The presence of people is a botheration to them. Nobody is bothered about the people who wait for them the whole day and leave hopelessly. But, their presence on schedule and leaving the office at the correct time is on record correctly. They were never courteous. They are harsh and they dont give a hearing to the membership. They dont give us the information we ask for. They never give us our dues on the due dates. The talk in the town is that they lend the money to the vendors in the (deleted) town on a daily interest basis. The men and women in this office have their favourites to whom they give preferential treatment. One beneficiary had to write to the District Secretary requesting him to intervene to obtain a loan from his bank account. There is a privileged class among the beneficiaries who are close associates of the staves of these offices whose applications for loans are entertained for immediate attention but, to those who cannot exert influence on the staffs concerned are given a reply that you are not given loans.
I have seen such penalized beneficiaries weeping when their applications were rejected and leaving an office cursing them in sotto voce. It was a heart ending moment to watch. They treat the innocent indifferently. Even if such people genuflect in worship they dont consider them because they dont offer cakes and money out of what they draw. This is a matter that demands an investigation on the sly. These days forms are being issued to grant a loan of Rs.5,000. There are many who have not got the form. It is publicly known that they chase them away when they ask for the form. There are two arm-twisters namely (deleted) and the man at the entrance seen as a record keeper and (deleted). She says Hodahithin yanawa eliyata. The man at the entrance says Maawa yaka aussannenethiwa yanawa eliyata. This is a matter that demands an investigation on the sly.
Is this the way how the elderly people should be treated by people in a government sponsored office from where a humanitarian service is rendered to them Is this not ageism. In other words, is this not prejudice on the grounds of age Is this not a mortal sin
During the previous government identified today as Rajapaksa Regime the Samurdhi was converted to a Divineguma. It created a bureaucracy. As a result, Divineguma had to serve the bureaucrats not the beneficiaries. Since the day they were appointed they became a cantankerous crowd crying out for rights taking to the streets. Now, leaving aside the bureaucracy they want to contest at elections. So, it is crystal clear that they have been appointed as aspirant apprentices and canvassers to prepare for an oncoming election under cover of Divineguma. It subsequently became a Pandoras Box to the minister concerned and a puzzler that could not be resolved until the downfall of the regime. I have to conclude at this stage since Divieguma authorities have gone before the court of law.
Divineguma to Samurdhi
When the present government came to power, Divineguma was at first handed over to Samurdhi Minister Sajith Premadasa who was not the appropriate person to hold that position since he inherited a responsible portfolio from his father, the late President Premadasa and had a flair for it. He complied at first, and I think he later complained about his unwillingness to carry on with it hence the decision to transfer it to another was taken after a reshuffle. It was handed over to the same minister who held it at first unsuccessfully.
Although the United National Party in 2001 had all the powers to make any changes it did not think of changing Samurdhi to Janasaviya again as a tit for tat although it was its founder because, the highbrow in it did not stoop to that low level of the lowbrow.
As soon as this government was formed, the Sri Lanka Freedom Party was instrumental in changing the Divineguma to Samurdhi uttering a Cocks cry. Following this followed a hue and cry from among the beneficiaries throughout the country about a decision by the new minister to scrap their names. And, that came to a halt when the president intervened and affirmed that affirmative action taken will not be reversed and the privileges enjoyed will not be withdrawn.
Changing name boards in this morally disgusting manner according to the whims and fancies of unscrupulous politicians has done nothing for the beneficiaries. It only puzzled them and created uncertainties.
This is a department that should be scrutinized by the Auditor General. He will make startling revelations to the country which will in turn make it possible for the government to revivify this department to make it a house where humanism dwells.

Engineering  a future
At the crossroad of Electronic Engineering or Computer Science: Computer Science and Engineering is there for an individual to excel. How to succeed, though, depends on your commitment, interest and, especially, qualities, in-born or otherwise.
Making good use of a Computer Science and Engineering degree needs careful thought. Take a cue from Microsoft Student Ambassador and Software Engineer Keet Milan Sugathadasa.
Winning the Best ICT Student of the Year 2017 is just the icing on the cake for this youth who had represented Sri Lanka in a handful of international competitions.
I am into product development and innovation is my passion. I decided that computer science is the best route to take if I want to excel in that sector. Technology is changing by the minute. It is a fast paced field. You need to keep track of the field to be update on the subject. That excites me as I am someone who is always on the go, Keet explained.
Receiving the Best ICT Student (undergraduate) of the Year 2017 award at the CSSL ICT Awards
He is part of Team Titans, a group of students from the Computer Science and Engineering Department of Moratuwa University, who are sent to represent Sri Lanka at international competitions. Dimuthu Kariyawasam, Buddhi Ayesha, Vindula Jayawardena and Naduni Mendis comprise the rest of the team.
They team took part and reached the world finalist category AirAsia Airvolution 2017 held in Malaysia.
The event was launched by AirAsia, the Malaysian airlines company, to select products for their company. There were over 300 competitors. We reached the final 20. The Singaporean team was the winners. We had to brainstorm for an idea about a product that will fit their requirements, develop it and market it at the event. We were only given 24 hours to launch our project. We spoke to people, got feedback and developed solutions to combat the issue and finally came up with a product. People get to see the seats that they book when they book online but they do not know what kind of person they are seated next to. Our app allows them to get to know about the personality of the person that they are next to so that they can book a seat next to someone of similar passions and tastes. This way they can interact with them and have engaging conversations with them during the long flights, he explained adding that this is more like a customized flight seating which allows the flyers to get a better experience on the flight itself. Private and sensitive information like the age of the person will not be revealed through this app.

They also reached the world finalist category at the Imagine Cup 2017 South East Asia Regional Finals held in Philippines and the world finalists category at the Image Cup 2017 World Finals held in the US.
We presented a product which we developed for asthma patients. It detects their breathing patters via their ears. It is a wearable device which is placed on their ear and it stimulates a mobile game. This is like a treatment for them to breath properly. It was a hit, especially with the kids over there, he expressed adding that the device was developed with the help of Kalubowila Teaching Hospital and Lady Ridgeway. Hemas Hospitals is currently engaged in helping them in further developing the product.
A born leader Keet has spearheaded many projects at the university. He has organized over 15 major events for the department during his stint. This has gotten him the rare feat of becoming the universitys batch representative for four consecutive years.
I normally sleep only for about four or five hours a day. This has become a habit because I am consistently engaged in work involving projects or in organizing events. I have put together AGM, batch get togethers, trips, events for other batches and ceremonial events.
A bundle of talent all rolled into one Keet has excelled academics as well as aesthetics at S. Thomas College, Mount Lavinia. He has been named as the best all round student for many years and had been a college prefect, house prefect and secretary of the house. He had held significant positions like being the president, vice president and secretary at many clubs and societies like the Model Rail Road Club, Photographic Club, Social Work and Welfare Society, Classical Music Association, Science Society, Current Affairs Forum, Scrabble Club and Art Club.
Queried about his ability to multi task and pat comes the answer.
The only thing I did not do is go for tuition classes for my studies. I bought text books and studied by myself. When most of the kids were on the road going from one tuition class to another I used up all my afternoons to take part in extracurricular activities like playing badminton, table tennis, scrabble and rifle shooting. I studied mainly at night. I also engaged in mentoring and public speaking, he said.
The 24 year old beat more than 400 applicants from the government as well as private sector to clinch the ICT Student of the Year award this year by proving his mettle as a budding young software engineer and an all rounder.
Lecturers of the Moratuwa University nominated my name. We were shortlisted and after going through our achievements and facing an interview, they finally picked me, he enthused.
Presenting their project at the AirAsia Airvolution 2017 in MalaysiaWith the winning team at the Microsoft Image Cup 2017 South East Asia Regional Finals in Philippines
Keet has also won first place in the Inter-University Business Concept Competition  Fiontrai 2016, the Google IO Extended Hackathon held in 2016 and the IESL  YMS Hackathon held in 2015. The events were organized by Moratuwa University. He won the Gold Award at the Emerged Winners at NBQSA 2017 for tertiary technology category at the National Best Quality Software Award 2017.
I have met some exceptional people during my ventures. They are not public figures but have achieved great heights in their fields. Such people inspire me. Their achievements motivate me to try harder to reach for the stars in my chosen fields, he mused.
Keet is in his final year at the Moratuwa University. He is also employed as a visiting instructor and grader at the university. His father, Rohitha Sugathadasa, is employed in the banking sector and his mother, Mallika Sugathadasa, is in the medical profession. His brother Leet Milan Sugathadasa is also into banking.
I got into public speaking when I took part in competitions. The maximum number of audience I have addressed is around 3000. Now I get constant invitations to engage in public speaking, he added with a smile.
He spends his free time blogging. He reads topics which captures his interests and later shares his thoughts about the subject.
Excelling in the computer science and engineering field is all about how passionate you are towards the subject. Every field is connected to computer science. You do not have to be an expert to take it on. You will learn something new every day. Never be an expert. Always be a learner, he advised.
The most difficult part of his profession is the diversity of the people he had to work with.
Getting diverse people to work together in the same potential is a trial indeed. Everyone needs to be cooperative and collaborative in such a situation. Their levels of understanding and patience is different too.
His advice to youth is not to be afraid to take risks.
Take risks and make mistakes. The more you make mistakes, take them as life lessons and learn more. I have faced situations in which I have felt embarrassed in front of many people but I never back down and gave up. Today I am also a professional public speaker, he said.

Limiting jeeps entering Yala
Environmentalists commend DWC decision
Environmentalists who commended the Department of Wildlife and Conservations (DWC) decision to limit the number of jeeps entering the Yala National Park (YNP) asked that Department officials be allowed to enforce the regulation without any interference.
The Wildlife and Nature Protection Society (WNPS) of Sri Lanka which held a media briefing on the subject stressed that it was important that vehicle numbers be restricted in the park to conserve both wildlife as well as tourism.
If it continues in the way it does and the tourist numbers grow, the park will not last for very long,Vice President of the Society, Ranil Peiris said.
He was addressing the media at the BRC Clubhouse. Around 70 percent of tourists who visited Yala said they would not return though they were able to spot animals because they had a uncomfortable experience, added WNPS Committee member Rohan Wijesinghe who insisted that the government needed to focus on improving the tourism experience in the country, if the tourism numbers are to rise.
DWC sources stated that in 2016, Yala had a total number of 658,277 visitors to the park in over 700 registered jeeps; the most frequently visited national park in the country. Given such pressures put on the park, the Prime Ministers Office appointed a Committee in 2016 headed by former DWC Director General Dr.Sumith Pilapitiya to look into ways of reducing the number of visitors.
One of their main recommendations was to limit the number of vehicles entering the park and to enforce driver discipline, Dr.Pilapitiya said.
Their recommendation to limit vehicle numbers was thus implemented when the Park was reopened on October 23, almost a week earlier than expected. The DWC had earlier decided to close it for two months, due to the prevailing drought.
The sudden limits imposed on the jeep drivers however drew wide protests from the Jeep Drivers Association with many insisting that their incomes would be effected and have launched a boycott of Block 1 in Yala, he said.
Dr.Pilapitiya who was part of the proposal however pointed out that the action plan prepared by his team had been implemented too soon and in an unsystematic manner. He blamed political interferences in the recent protest with the jeep drivers and stated that there would be no problem if officials and jeep drivers were allowed to come a mutually beneficial settlement.
Wildlife has become highly political in the last 10 years, as a former DG, I know that we cannot do the job properly due to political interferences,he said.
Since 2008 vehicle numbers to the park have been on the increase, with numbers rising by over 1,000 percent from 2008-2016, Dr.Pilapitiya said.
In 2015, the reawakening Yala programme was designed and in 2016 we started to implement it. We were able to successfully implement that because the Department did not allow political interferences. For example, in the early months of 2016, former Park Warden Suranga Rathnayake banned over 70 jeeps and no one protested. This was because we implemented the law for all equally, Dr.Pilapitiya said.
He stressed that it was important to implement these programmes with the social aspect of livelihoods in mind and that jeep drivers welcome such changes as it would improve the long term viability of their own profession.
The only grievance they have is that the law is not applied to all drivers equally, the former DG said.
Dr.Pilapitiyas committee had suggested 31 short term actions, nine mid-term and two long term but he pointed all of these had to be implemented without political interference and in a systematic manner.
The fastest possible decision to implement, he said would be the improvement of driver discipline.
You cannot impose such rules immediately. The situation is very complex, it is better to have discussions and come to a common agreement that is beneficial for all,Dr.Pilapitiya said.
The DWC and the Jeep Drivers Association representatives were expected to meet last night to come to an agreement over the limits.

Govt stopped agreements that gave land ownership to China
This government terminated all agreements of the previous government that gave outright ownership of lands in the Colombo Port City to the Chinese government, said Colombo Port City Project Director Nihal Fernando, yesterday.
He said the tri-party agreement in 2016 also prevented some of the other lands from being owned by the Chinese company after the 99 years lease, in par with the 2014 agreement by the previous government and all lands were granted a 99-year lease agreement. "All lands in the Colombo Port City will be owned by the Sri Lankan government after the completion of the period in the lease agreement," said Fernando. "This is a victory of the people."
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Colombo Port City project premises.
Fernando pointed out that outright ownership of 20 hectares of the Colombo Port City project had been granted to China under the 2014 agreement and the rest was leased for 99 years. "All those lands were given to the Chinese company under a 99-year lease agreement," Fernando said. "It was a responsibility of the Sri Lankan government to provide infrastructure facilities up to the terminals of the project premises and maintaining the Colombo Port City according to the 2014 agreement. But this government could minimize the government's role and proposed to set up a public-private partnership for the activities".
He said the same agreement in 2014 had prevented the government from commencing projects in government lands in the Colombo Port City premises, other than those related to education and culture, within three years of the completion of construction. However, this government could terminate those clauses and include clauses to set up hospitals, reception halls, conference halls, exhibition centres, Colombo International Financial City etc.
Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka also participated in the press conference.

Growth figures raise  chances of rate rise
The UKs economy had higher than expected growth in the three months to September - increasing the chances of a rise in interest rates in November.
Gross domestic product (GDP) for the quarter rose by 0.4%, compared with 0.3% in each of 2017s first two quarters, according to latest Office for National Statistics figures.
Services and manufacturing industries grew during the period. Industrial production rose in July and August but construction output fell.
The financial markets are now indicating an 84% probability that rates will rise from their current record low of 0.25% when the Bank of Englands Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) meets on 2 November.Governor Mark Carney indicated to the BBC last month that rates could rise in the relatively near term.
UK economist Ruth Gregory, of research company Capital Economics, said the figures have probably sealed the deal on an interest rate hike next week. While many economists echo that view, some think the Bank of England will keep rates where they are.
If all we can muster... is an acceleration in economic growth thats so small you could blink and miss it, the Bank of England could still think better of a rate rise next week, said Ross Andrews from Minerva Lending.
Will interest rates rise next week Analysis by economics editor Kamal Ahmed
The slightly better growth figures will strengthen the arguments of the interest rate hawks on the Bank of Englands monetary policy committee.

Has Sri Lanka  forgotten  how to bat 
ABU DHABI, Wednesday: There is something terribly wrong with the Sri Lankan one-day international sides batting. Can someone put a finger on what that problem is
For two successive series running the batsmen have made the same mistakes over and over again and suffered the humiliation of 5-0 whitewashes at the hands of Asian giants India and Pakistan in successive series.
Man of the Series Hasan Ali with 14 wickets.
This is not the Sri Lankan one-day sides that we have got accustomed to. Where are those big hitters like the Jayasuriyas and the Kaluwitharanas and the stroke players like the Aravindas, Ranatungas, Sangakkaras, Jayawardenes and Dilshans. Since these great stars left the scene there suddenly seems to be a dearth of quality one-day batsmen who could take the game to the opposition.
What we see today are batsmen surrendering meekly to bowlers whom they should be hitting out of the park  no effort to dominate the bowling, no feet movement, no rotation of the strike and no plan by the batsmen to bat out the full quota of 50 overs.
It seems that Sri Lankan batsmen have suddenly forgotten why they have a bat in their hands.
There was a time when we were showing the rest of the world how to play one-day cricket with several innovations brought about by those wonderful coaches from Australia who served Sri Lanka well to keep the nation ahead of the rest of the field and take them to win a World Cup and figure in two other World Cup finals. We are talking here only of fifty-over cricket.
What is difficult to fathom is how the current batsmen struggle to play spin especially in a country where spin is so dominant that it has produced the greatest wicket-taker in history Muthiah Muralitharan and the most successful left-arm spinner in the game Rangana Herath. There have been occasions that even domestic matches sometimes see spinners opening the bowling with the new ball. So how come that our batsmen brought up on turning tracks struggle to compete at a higher level
We talk so much about talent being available in the country. But talent is one word that present head coach Nic Pothas of South Africa does not like because according to him the way some people misinterpret it.
What is talent mean asked Pothas. The world overlooks at players that hit the ball nicely and move nicely. Look at someone like Shivnarine Chanderpaul they would not use the word talent alongside him but his average is in excess of 50 in Tests. Talent is a very broad word. If you havent got the mental capability and the ability to adapt to the usual skills I dont believe that is talent. I think we need to stop using that word because people misinterpret what it means.
Leading run scorer in the series Babar Azam with 303 runs at an average of over 100.
Talent or no talent Sri Lanka will need a quick fix to their batting problems before the team loses its belief and self confidence and goes to pieces. There is a limit to the losses one can absorb and Sri Lanka are certainly running out of time. Thankfully, they have got over the automatic qualification period for the next World Cup with the deadline for it ending on September 30. Had that date got extended one dreads to think where Sri Lanka would have ended up in the rankings. Despite the successive 5-0 thrashings they are still clinging onto the no. 8 spot with six points separating them from ninth ranked West Indies.
The fact that only two batsmen scored over 100 runs and the next highest batsmen were Thisara Perera with 91 runs and Akila Dananjaya with 70 runs tells you the sad story of Sri Lankas batting miseries in the series against Pakistan.
One thought that the way Sri Lanka outplayed Pakistan in the two Tests to win the series handsomely 2-0 they would give a better performance in the ODIs. They had seven players who had appeared in the series winning Test team, but the results were disastrous.
Previously there has been only one occasion where one team had swept the Test series and the other the ODI series and it also happened in the UAE in 2011-12 when England lost the Test series to Pakistan 3-0 but won the ODI series 4-0.
Sarfraz Ahmed claimed at the end of the series that Pakistan had the best bowling attack in the world. I have been saying this, that we have the best bowling in the world and the fact that when you give an opportunity to someone and he performs, its great, said the Pakistan captain, Were going from strength to strength, we have lots of options. I want our batting to perform more; if we score 270-280, our bowling is strong enough to defend that.
Sarfraz lauded his bowlers for not letting the absence of Mohammad Amir hurt the team. We did not have Amir due to injury but Usman Shinwari filled that gap and throughout this series we did well with the ball and this is a great sign for us, he said.
Pakistan has not allowed any of its opponents to cross 250 in their nine-match winning streak. The last time they had conceded more runs was in the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 opener, when India beat them after scoring 319 for 3.
The pick of the bowlers was Hasan Ali, who has been in great form, taking 14 wickets in the five-match series to go to the top of the ICC rankings for ODI bowlers. Shadab Khan, the young leg-spinner, has also been outstanding with 10 wickets.
For the time being we will have to go with Sarfrazs claim because one cannot judge how good the Pakistani bowling was because of Sri Lankas underpar batting.
Sri Lankas beleaguered skipper Upul Tharanga admitted that his batsmen had no idea how to counter the aggression of the Pakistani bowlers. Throughout the series we did not have answer to Pakistans bowling as they were outstanding. Were not playing to our strengths, to our capability. We didnt score 200 three times. We couldnt handle the pressure.
Tharangas team was restricted to totals of 209-8, 187, 208, 173 and 103, failing to play out the quota of overs on four occasions.
Like in the bowling Pakistan found a batsman to fill the no. 3 slot vacated by the injury to Azhar Ali with Babar Azam playing the role to perfection scoring two centuries and a fifty in his four innings to average over 100.
The win gave Pakistan their sixth 5-0 series whitewash and ninth consecutive ODI win, a run that had started during the ICC Champions Trophy 2017 in June this year.

Ichthyosaur fossil discovered for first time in India

Scientists in India have discovered a 152 million-year-old fossil of an ichthyosaur - an extinct marine reptile - in the western state of Gujarat.
This is the first time an ichthyosaur fossil has been discovered in India.
The fossil was found inside rocks from the Mesozoic Era, which ran between 252 and 66 million years ago, in the Kutch desert.
Prof Guntupalli VR Prasad, who led the study, said the 5.5m (18ft) specimen was almost complete.
Only parts of the skull and tail bones were found to be missing.
The findings have been published in the Plos Onescience journal.
"This is a remarkable discovery not only because it is the first Jurassic ichthyosaur record from India, but also it throws light on the evolution and diversity of ichthyosaurs in the Indo-Madagascan region and India's biological connectivity with other continents in the Jurassic," Prasad said.
The team, which comprised scientists from India and Germany, believes the newly discovered specimen can be identified with Ophthalmosauridae, a family of ichthyosaurs that lived in the oceans between 165 and 90 million years ago.
Often misidentified as "swimming dinosaurs", they first appeared in the early Triassic period (251 million to 199 million years ago)
The name means fish-lizard, although the creature has been classified as a reptile since the mid-19th CenturyIts length ranged from 1m to 14m - although the average length was 2m to 3m (the Doncaster fossil is 1.5m)
The creature was noted for its sharp, robust teeth.Ichthyosaurs became extinct before the dinosaurs, dying out in the early part of the late Cretaceous period (145.5 million to 65.5 million years ago)
A statement from the team said the identification of the new specimen may further throw light on whether there was any marine connection between India and South America about 150 million years ago.
An examination of the teeth of the fossil suggests that it was a top-tier predator in its ecosystem, it added.

IIT offers internships at MNCs, blue chips
Informatics Institute of Technology (IIT), the pioneer in providing globally renowned British higher education in Sri Lanka since 1990, is offering a unique opportunity for its undergraduate students to gain invaluable professional exposure at multinational and local blue-chip companies.
As part of the University of Westminster undergraduate degree, IIT students following BEng (Hons) Software Engineering, BSc (Hons) Business Information Systems, BSc (Hons) Computer Science (specializing in Mobile and Web Computing, Games and Computer Graphics Development or Multimedia Computing disciplines) and the BA (Hons) Business Management programmes will be provided a one-year industrial placement (internship) at renowned organizations.
One of the biggest dilemmas faced by the educated youth currently is the issue of receiving suitable employment following graduation. Sri Lanka has been grappling with the problem of unemployed graduates for decades. With the objective of ensuring employability and high demand for their graduates, IIT is providing exclusive internship opportunities.
The senior panel of academics at IIT says that the institute focuses on striking a balance between academic teaching and real world practical teachings. The industrial placements is an important component of the degree programmes offered at IIT as it will provide vital industrial exposure, help students inculcate the right attitude towards work and will provide an opportunity to focus on specific specialized areas.
IIT's Dean Naomi Krishnarajah said that the industrial placement enables the student to understand the corporate environment and realistic preview of the world of work', learn new skills and apply what was taught during the course.
She added that the internship at prestigious organizations help groom students to make informed choices during the final year of their degree programme. The exposure also enriches the students experience in making career path decisions after graduation and mesh into the corporate world with ease, Krishnarajah said.
The educational foundation laid at IIT and co-curricular activities it offers, helps students to discover their potential. IIT also provides an environment for students to develop creative, entrepreneurial and leadership skills. The internship is also a valued entity that contributes towards the professional growth of the student. Finally it is the student who ventures into the real world and proves their potential, Krishnarajah said.
This internship is undertaken during the third year of the degree programme and provides students with an invaluable opportunity to gain practical competencies and skills to complement the knowledge gained. Job experience, networking, academic insight and professional understanding are just some of the many benefits that an internship can provide. Students are placed in prestigious organizations in and around Colombo. Those who have undergone this internship have found that it has added great value to their degree programme as it has given them the practical experience they need to underpin their theoretical learning and also exposes them to the industry, giving them first-hand experience in areal work environment. All students are encouraged to follow the one-year internship programme as it is invaluable in giving them a headstart in pursuing their chosen career path, following graduation from IIT, Shyani Siriwardene, Senior Lecturer/Course Leader at IIT, said.
Early this year, IIT held its annual Career Day with the objective of providing a platform for their graduates and students to obtain employment and internship opportunities at some of Sri Lankas leading companies.
During the 27 years of excellence in the tertiary education sector, IIT has produced over 3,000 graduates that are empowering over 250 organizations across the globe.
Over the years IIT has won many accolades for innovation in local and international competitions such as Microsoft Imagine Cup, National Best Quality Software Awards (NBQSA), APICTA, British Council-HSBC Youth Enterprise Award, mBillionth Award South Asia and e-Swabhimani.

India thrash Kiwis amid ODI pitch-tampering storm
Pune: Half-centuries from Shikhar Dhawan and Dinesh Karthik fired India to a comfortable six-wicket win over New Zealand after a pitch-tampering storm threatened the second one-day international in Pune on Wednesday.
Dhawan scored a classy 68 and Karthik notched an unbeaten 64 as India made 232-4 to clinch victory with 24 balls to spare and level the three-match ODI series 1-1.
The match had looked to be under threat after a groundsman at the Maharashtra Cricket Association (MCA) stadium told undercover journalists that he had doctored the pitch before the game.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) dismissed Pandurang Salgaoncar, the pitch manager at the Pune ground, after he described to India Today TV reporters, who were posing as bookies, how he had tampered with the surface.
"The BCCI has zero tolerance towards any activity that brings the game into disrepute," Amitabh Choudhary, the BCCI's acting honorary secretary, said in a statement.
The International Cricket Council said that it had launched an investigation into the pitch tampering claims "to establish the facts".
Another curator was swiftly drafted in before match referee Chris Broad inspected the pitch and gave the game the go-ahead to start on schedule.
New Zealand captain Kane Williamson won the toss and chose to bat as the visitors looked to clinch the series with a victory following their six-wicket win in the opening ODI in Mumbai on Sunday.
India had other ideas though and restricted the Kiwis to 230-9.
Fast bowler Bhuvneshwar Kumar claimed three wickets while paceman Jasprit Bumrah and spinner Yuzvendra Chahal chipped in with two each.
Henry Nicholls top-scored for New Zealand with 42 while skipper Williamson's miserable series continued, adding just three runs to the six he made on Sunday.
Left-hander Dhawan hit five fours and two sixes during his 84-ball knock before driving straight at Ross Taylor at cover for a simple catch off Adam Milne. AFP

Indian, Sri Lankan Navies to conduct Phase II of oceanographic survey
The Indian Navy and Sri Lanka Navy will conduct Phase II of the joint oceanographic survey off the Southern and Western Coasts of Sri Lanka from today (October 26) to December 21. The survey will be undertaken by Indian Naval ship INS Sutlej, which is an indigenously designed and constructed vessel that is fitted with the latest state of the art survey equipment. This would be the second survey tasking that would be undertaken by Sutlej in Sri Lanka.
The ship was deployed to Galle and Colombo in 2004 in the aftermath of the Tsunami to survey both the harbours.
Phase II survey would be more complex and detailed than previous surveys undertaken and would focus on waters closer to the coast as well as the coastline features.
As in the past, personnel from Survey Branch of the Sri Lanka Navy took part in the conduct of the survey. Consolidation training would also be conducted for Sri Lanka Navy personnel so that the knowledge during previous interactions could be built upon. This deployment of the
ship presents an opportunity for both navies to learn from each other in the highly specialised field of Hydrography and would serve to build on the strong professional bonds that exist between the two Navies. During its deployment, INS Sutlej will also undertake a series of community welfare activities, sports and professional training exchanges with Sri Lanka Navy personnel.
It may be recalled that in May 2017, the one and half month long Phase I of the joint oceanographic survey was successfully completed by both the navies. INS Darshak, an Indian Naval survey vessel had visited Sri Lanka for the purpose.

Indonesia fireworks factory explosion kills dozens

At least 23 people have been killed and dozens injured after an explosion and fire at an Indonesian fireworks factory, the Police said.
The blaze took hold at around 09:00 local time (02:00 GMT), at an industrial complex in Tangerang, west of the capital Jakarta.
"We are still evacuating victims," Tangerang Kota police chief Harry Kurniawan told AFP.
Television footage showed thick smoke pouring from the factory.
The blaze has been brought under control, but the exact number of casualties is still being confirmed.
"There are 103 workers in total working for this factory," Nico Afinta, director of general crime at Jakarta Police, told Indonesia's Kompas TV.
He said 43 people had been injured and were being treated in three hospitals, and that the remains of 23 victims had been found.
Parts of the building collapsed after the fire swept through, and nearby cars were burned out.
A local government official told Metro TV the factory had only been running for six weeks.

Interactive session on Inland Revenue Act
The new inland revenue act will be effective from April 1, 2018. Suresh R.I. Perera, Attorney at Law, Tax Principal at KPMG will carry out an in-depth analysis of the significant changes to the new Act at Ramada Hotel on November 1.
The session will cover business, investment and employment income.
Referring to the introduction of the much talked about capital gains tax in Sri Lanka, Perera said, "It is not correct to say that Sri Lanka has introduced a new tax called capital gains tax. Capital gains has not even been included as a source of income, which was the case prior to 2002. The new Act imposes income tax on capital gains, gains on investments and certain capital receipts.
"The new Act also has provisions pertaining to methods of computation when assets are passed on to a spouse on a divorce or separation, on death and also when assets are being gifted.
"What is significant is that income tax liability on gains arises not only in relation to assets but the tax could arise in relation to realisation of liability too."
Further Perera added, "Understanding the concept of 'realisation' is vital as it is this incidence that triggers the income tax on gains from capital and investments. It's not restricted to mere sale or gifting. The word is defined very broadly in the new Act to include many incidences pertaining to assets and liabilities. An understanding of the finer points of this concept would pave the way for efficient tax planning."
The seminar organised by UTO EduConsult will be held at Hotel Ramada Colombo on the November 1 from 2 pm to 5pm.

Iraqi forces launch assault on last IS bastion of al-Qaim

Iraqi forces have launched an offensive to recapture the last bastion of so-called Islamic State in the country.
Soldiers, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia paramilitary fighters are taking part in the assault on al-Qaim and Rawa, in the Euphrates river valley close to the border with Syria.
The prime minister told IS militants to "choose between death and surrender".
The jihadists still control part of the Euphrates valley in the neighbouring Syrian province of Deir al-Zour.
But they are under pressure there from Syrian pro-government forces and a US-backed alliance of Kurdish and Arab fighters who recently took the city of Raqqa from IS.
"The heroic legions are advancing into the last den of terrorism in Iraq to liberate al-Qaim, Rawa and the surrounding villages and hamlets," Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said in a statement on Thursday morning.
"They will all return to the arms of the motherland thanks to the determination and endurance of our fighting heroes," he added.
On Wednesday, Iraqi military planes had dropped leaflets over the area telling people to "go to any house on top of which a white flag has been raised when the liberation forces enter al-Qaim".
Al-Qaim, about 315km (195 miles) north-west of Baghdad, Rawa and the nearby Syrian border town of Albu Kamal are of strategic importance to IS as the group used routes through them to transfer fighters, weapons and goods.
The towns are also symbolically important because they made up IS's self-styled, cross-border "Euphrates Province", which was a symbol of the group's intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to rest the 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement.
Some 75,000 civilians are believed to be still living in western Anbar province, while 65,000 have fled since January - mostly children, women and older people.
The Norwegian Refugee Council said more than 10,000 had arrived at campsclose to the provincial capital Ramadi since the beginning of October.
It reported that staff had heard accounts of forced recruitment by IS of boys as young as 11, food shortages and widespread human rights violations.
"We didn't make it to this place without seeing death with our own eyes a thousand times," Nafa Yacob, who paid up to $400 to smugglers for a safe passage out of al-Qaim for his 13 family members two months ago, was quoted as saying.
"Now we have lost everything because of the trip. We found it very difficult for my son [who has a severe physical disability] and wife to go to the latrines. We cannot sleep. We cannot afford to go out of the camp," he added.
The Norwegian Refugee Council is providing food, water, basic hygiene and household supplies at the camps, but it warned that people were desperately short of assistance due to a lack of resources.
Only 62% of the UN's 2017 Humanitarian Response Plan for Iraq has found funding.

Lanka looking to turn things around with new captain in T20 format
Wednesday: Sri Lanka with a new T20 International captain Thisara Perera will be hoping to turn things around in what has so far been a fluctuating tour for them in the UAE.
When Sri Lanka beat Pakistan 2-0 in the Test series the impression given to everyone was that the team had put back the previous defeats and turned the corner and they would carry on the form into the ODIs as well. But unfortunately no. The five ODIs proved a disaster as Sri Lanka were whitewashed 5-0 to suffer that ignominy for the third time this year (the first two being at the hands of South Africa and India).
Now with several of the ODI players including the T20I captain Upul Tharanga pulling out of the T20 side as they were not happy going to Lahore to play in the third T20I of the three-match series, the national selectors appointed hard hitting fast bowling all-rounder Thisara Perera to lead a squad of 16 players that includes seven players who had been part of the ODI squad and excludes eight (including injured Angelo Mathews) from the squad selected for the one-off T20 against India but who have shown concern in travelling to Lahore.
I believe in my team and think we can give a good challenge to Pakistan, said Perera in his inaugural press conference with the media yesterday.
We have good talent and young players. In this kind of team, I believe we can do something special, better than the ODIs, he said.
I have given 100 per cent to my team players. If they are playing this series, they dont need to fear, just give 100 per cent.
Ive already spoke to them, and told them this is a good opportunity for everyone. If we do perform well, this can be a turning point in their lives, Perera said.
Perera who was an integral part of the ODI side was of the view that every team goes through a lean phase and that Sri Lanka would come out of it soon.
Every team has at times failures. It is part of the game. The selectors and I have given these new players 100 per cent confidence. Dont be a selfish player, but give 100 per cent of what you have to the team.
It is an honour to represent my country, especially as captain. It is a new challenge for me, and my team, said Perera who will be captaining a team for the first time in his cricket career. A product of St Josephs College, Colombo, Perera who played his cricket at school alongside Angelo Mathews, Dimuth Karunaratne and Roshen Silva said that he missed out captaining his school when the age limit was lowered to 19.
I have not had the opportunity to lead any team except be vice-captain to Dinesh Chandimal.
Sri Lankas T20 International record for the year is not as bad as their ODIs.
They have won two away series 2-1 in Australia and South Africa, drawn one-all at home with Bangladesh and lost a one-off T20I at home to India.
So overall they have 5-4 win record in 9 matches.
However not much can be said about their bilateral ties with Pakistan where they trail 5-10.
T20 is one format where you cant say one team is favourite. Our focus is on the first match as it is always important to start on a high and then target the remaining matches, said a confident Pakistani skipper Sarfraz Ahmed.
I know a lot of these new players who have come into the Lankan team. I know them as I have played against them when they were with the A team. I know Mahela Udawatte, (Danushka) Gunathilaka and (Isuru) Udana. T20 is a different form of the game and whoever plays better on the day will win. It will be an interesting series and fans will be able to see good cricket, he said.
Pakistan will be strengthened by the return of their star bowler Mohammad Amir from injury. Amir missed the ODI series but his absence was not felt when newcomers Ruuman Raees and Usman Khan Shinwari turned up with match winning performances.
It is good that whichever players we are giving chances are performing and it shows how much talent we have in Pakistan cricket. All the players selected are looking to prove a point, said Sarfraz.
Usman Shinwari came and performed, Faheem Ashraf also performed so it is good that we have a strong bench strength and it has become difficult to decide which bowlers have to be included and whom to be rested, he said.

## Title: LID LOOKS!
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features
## Date: Thursday, October 26, 2017 - 01:00
LID LOOKS!
The natural look never goes out of style. Great looking eye make up are turn heads and grab eyeballs. If you are still wondering how to accentuate your eyes, then you are on the right place. Read on for some pointers to get fresh, flawless looks for your peepers.
Proper order of applying makeup on the face
The proper way of applying make up is you should first cleanse your face, tone and use a moisturizer. The primer, concealer, foundation, face powder, blush, eye shadow, eyeliner, mascara, lip liner and lip stick should follow next.
Eyeliner, eye shadow or mascara first
There is a certain level of creativity you can apply to make up, meaning there are no hard and fast rules that designate when to use your products. Still, there are guidelines you may find helpful to follow. When it comes to eye shadows and eyeliners, its best to start with eye shadow, then move on to your eyeliner and the last would be your mascara.
Lining the inner rims of your eyes
Wearing eyeliner on the inner rims of the eye may be a bad idea for people who wear contact lenses or for those who have sensitive eyes. You can be prone to eye infection if your eyeliner harbours bacteria.
Using it in the inner rims of your eyes could be just as bad as shoving it into your eyes. However, wearing eyeliner inside or outside the lash line is a personal choice.
Eyelash extensions
Lash extensions are tiny individual lashes that are dipped in a special glue that bonds them to your natural eyelash. It makes your natural lashes look fuller and longer. You can get the look customized to your liking.
Natural eyebrow liner
Pencils and powders work wonders to bridge the gaps and set off a natural look for your eyebrow liner. , Place a brush along the sides of your nose to find where your brows should ideally start. Angle the brush from the outside of your nose to the outer corner of your eye to find where your brows should end. This should be your guideline for your eyebrows. Brush the brows upwards with an eyebrow brush. This helps you to see the shape of the brows and to see the uneven areas. When using the brow pencil apply short, feathery, hair-like stokes angled in the same direction as the hair growth. Refrain from drawing a solid, hard-looking line. Short, feather strokes gives a natural look to the eyebrows.
Smudged liquid eyeliner
It is all about the based when it comes to making your eyeliner last. Apply an eye shadow primer to your lids to give your eyeliner lasting power.
Face premier as eye primer
Face primer will not work better than eye primer which is designed to use on the eyes. This is because the skin on your face is significantly different from the skin on your eyes. As a result of this what each product is designed to do is different.
More than one eye shadow brush
You need to have more than one eye shadow brush because you get different brushes for different areas of the eyes. You get the crease blending brush to smudge the eye shadow and to blend it. You get dense rounded blending brush for quick applications and blended cream shadow looks. The fluffy rounded blending brush is used with a transition shade for a sheer wash of colours on the crease and to avoid harsh lines. The small, tapered blending brush is for a cut-crease look. The duo fiber blending brush needs to be used with light pressure around the brow bone to help crease colors and seamlessly fade them. Use slightly more pressure in the crease to blend multiple colours.
Eye shadow colour to match ones eyes or clothes
There are no hardcore rules for applying eye shadow colours. If your dress is a real statement, piece maybe you dont need much make up at all. As for colour, you probably wouldnt want to match it to your dress - unless you are wearing black, grey or neutrals.
In that case it would be fine to match your eye shadow with the outfit since those colours are basics anyway.
Eye make up for spectacle users
You need to draw your eye liner thicker as this ensures your specs dont overpower your eyes. Dramatic smokey eyes look good on those who wear glasses.
Removing waterproof mascara
Use an eye makeup remover to remove mascara. A good waterproof eye make up remover will remove all vestiges of the waterproof mascara quickly, safely and effectively. If you wear waterproof mascara a lot investing on a good waterproof eye make up remover is definitely worth it.
Dos and don'ts while applying eyeliner, mascara and eye shadow

4 When applying liner, try not to pull the skin on the side of your face. If things get a little messy, clean up your line with a makeup removersoaked cotton swab.

4 If you are just starting out with liquid liner, begin with dots. Then slowly connect them.

4 Wedge the brush at the base of the lashes and sweep the wand outwards with a slight wiggling motion.

4 For the lower lashes, just use the tip of the wand and stroke down from the base to the tips of the lashes.

4 For the thickest, darkest lashes apply a coat of mascara and wait for it to dry, using a lash comb to separate the lashes while you are waiting, then reapply a final coat.

4 Dont share mascara, as you risk contaminating the product.

4 Never pump the wand in and out of your mascara tube. This pushes air into the tube and dries out the product, causing clumps to form. Instead twist your mascara wand.

4 Clean your lashes well before using mascara .

4 Use more than one eye shadow colour. Using more than one colour on your lid will create depth and dimension to your look. It also allows you to be more creative with your application. If done correctly it can make your eyes appear bigger.

4 Change your makeup application to stay fresh and to have fun! If you wear a black smoky eye one day, why not try a bronze smoky eye the next day
All of the makeup out there makes it really fun to be a lady. While there arent too many rules that you must stick to, the above dos and donts are really great guidelines to keep in mind. Creating a beautiful canvas on your face with makeup can boost your confidence and make you feel on top of the world! And really, isnt that what we all would love to feel

Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake yesterday stressed that his endeavour is to create a clean judiciary and ensure justice for all.
Speaking to the media after appearing before the Supreme Court over the contempt of court case, when it was taken up yesterday, the Deputy Minister said he will continue his struggle to condemn judges and lawyers who protect rogues, drug barons and thugs.
The case is to be taken again on November 21.
I was not summoned to appear before the court today, but I voluntarily came as I am not a coward.
The rich who had committed grave offences get off the hook by taking legal aid from the highest paid Presidents Counsels, while the poor who commit minor offences such as stealing three mangoes get convicted. The ordinary people cannot afford to take the legal assistance of those lawyers, he commented.
Law should not be practiced with a money oriented mind. My crusade was to expose the corrupt judges such as Sarath N Silva, Mohan Peiris, Lenin Rathnayake and Sarath de Abrew. We need to save people from the mafia in the court. Do not try to intimidate us. There is freedom of speech in this country. Nobody should be above the law may they be war heroes, politicians or religious leaders, he added.

The Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara yesterday dismissed security fears related to the Sri Lankan cricket team's tour of Lahore, Pakistan later this week.
Jayasekara explained that the ICC had cleared Lahore for the tour and stated that the security situation there is good.
"I have also asked our IGP to submit a separate report on security there and he is expected to hand it over by tomorrow", said the Minister addressing the weekly cabinet briefing.
Jayasekara further noted that Pakistan had promised VIP security to the team and had ensured that all precautions would be taken. He stressed that Pakistan is a friendly nation who stood by Sri Lanka during the war and greatly supported Sri Lanka in winning the war.
Jayasekara added that the Pakistani cricket team was one of the few teams which agreed to play in Sri Lanka when the island nation was in turmoil and it is fair for us to support them during such situations. With regard to the coaches who have refused to accompany the Sri Lankan team on tour, the Minister said it is up to Sri Lanka Cricket to decide whether they would continue to work with the team or not in future.
This will be the Lankan team's first visit to Pakistan since the terrorist attack on the team in 2009.

Releasing the annual report of the Sri Lanka Labour Force Survey (LFS) for 2016, Dr. A. J. Satharasinghe, Director General of the Department of Census and Statistics said the labour force for 2016 has been estimated as 8.3 million.
The overall unemployment rate reported in 2016 was 4.4 percent. The rate was 2.9 percent for males 7 percent for females. The highest unemployment rate was reported from youth (persons in age 15-24 years) and it was 21.6 percent. The reported female unemployment rate (7 %) was considerably higher than that of male (2.9%).
This was about 54 percent of the total working age population, of 15.4 million persons (age 15 years and above).

Ms. Tehmina Janjua, during her visit to Sri Lanka for 5th Round of Political Consultations, visited the historic Gangaramaya Temple in Colombo.
She was accompanied by the Deputy High Commissioner of Pakistan Dr. Sarfraz Ahmed Khan Sipra and other officials.
Chief Incumbent of the Gangaramaya Temple Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera warmly welcomed the Foreign Secretary and briefed her about the Temple and several social services under the patronage of the Temple.
Janjua said Pakistan prides itself to be the motherland of Buddhism and Gandhara. She added that the relationship between the two peoples and cultures exists from time immemorial taking a firm shape through 2,500 years of ties established during the golden eras of Gandhara and the rise of Buddhism.
She said that Pakistan, despite being a predominantly Muslim country has been celebrating Vesak at Taxila since 2016 as an annual festival that shows Pakistans commitment and harmony towards other religions. Pakistan has been the proud cosponsor of the UN Resolution of 1999 for declaring Vesak as one of UN annual days.
Ven. Galaboda Gnanissara Thera thanked the Government of Pakistan for providing many Sacred Relics to the Gangaramaya Temple and also paid gratitude to the Government of Pakistan for preserving the Buddhist Monasteries and sacred sites in Pakistan.

Sri Lanka A v West Indies A 3rd unofficial test under lights today
Patience, perseverance  provides success for Cornwall
FLORENCE HALL, Jamaica  Patience and persistence, they say, are the providers of progress which Rahkeem Cornwall continues to learn every time he takes the field.
The 24-year-old from Antigua was the most successful Windies A bowler in the second Test against Sri Lanka A which ended in three days last Saturday at the Trelawny Multiplex.
Cornwall collected 2-85 and 5-107, moving his aggregate for the series to 13, but the home team lost the second Test by a whopping 280 runs to leave the three-match series level 1-1 and set up a final showdown under lights, starting on Thursday at Sabina Park.
Our performance was not up to standard, he told CWI Media. We did not bat well enough to keep the Sri Lankans out of the game and win the series in the second match.
The pitch was spin-bowling friendly. I got seven wickets and (Malinda Pushpakumara) got 12, so the result hinged on whichever team batted the spin well  Sri Lanka did it and we did not, so they won.
He added: We have the final Test coming up and this will be played under the lights, which will be a challenge in itself, so it is important that we prepare well and get everything ready and right for that game because once we play to our potential there is no doubt that we can win the series.
But we have to go to practice over the next couple of days, work hard and do what we got to do to continue to perform strongly, and win the series. When we get into the game, we need to exhibit patience in batting and bowling, and the outcome we had in the first game can be repeated.
Cornwall has made a name for himself, as a mean off-spinner, generating bounce from his 6-foot, 4-inch frame and sharp turn from a whippy action.
He has taken 154 first-class wickets at an average of 24.96 apiece in 32 matches, including 12 hauls of five wickets or more in an innings and one haul of 10 wickets or more in a match.
Cornwall said the biggest lesson he has learnt from the two matches against Sri Lanka A is the value of patience.
My bowling is getting back there, he said. I have been out of the game for a little bit. I went to the United States to work on my fitness and so I am working on getting my bowling back to where it was previously. My success in the two matches so far has all been about being patience and putting the ball in the right areas, and also in my batting, using the patient approach, playing as straight as possible, playing in the V and when they come into your areas, look to score.
Cornwall said he has taken a lot of confidence from his early performances in the series and hopes to continue to reap the sweet rewards of his patience.
I have been trying very hard to stick to the basics and trying to continuously do the things that work for me. I get the ball to bounce, so I try to bring the batsman forward as much as possible, he said.
Being patient enough to consistently put the ball in the right areas is also important because it leaves the batsman to either make the mistake or a good ball to take a wicket.
I have to repeat the good things over and over, and see where it leads me and how it can help put the team in a match-winning position.
Meantime, the Selection Panel of Cricket West Indies has confirmed an unchanged 13-member squad for the final Test.

Physician, heal thyself
The GMOA, it appears, is on a moral crusade, perhaps, taking a breather from its agitations and protests campaigns, using medical students as pawns, to help achieve the goals of its political masters cum financiers. Not stopping at waging a relentless campaign against SAITM, the GMOA also took upon itself the task of dictating terms to the government on matters completely outside its remit and those which did not concern the medical profession.
It went about demanding from the government not to proceed with signing ETCA, an issue strictly to do with trade and economic policy of the government. Not stopping at that, the president of the GMOA was also seen in the company of the likes of Dr. Gunadasa Amarasekera and Manohara De Silva, at an event organised to deliver tirades on the government, for proceeding with the new constitution. The GMOA, it appears, has come a long way from SAITM, and, is today, meddling with issues that are not the business of members of the medical profession, such as constitution making and government trade policy.
Now comes the news that the GMOA has taken up cudgels with Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera, for allegedly attempting to reduce tax on liquor, in the upcoming budget, saying this would encourage liquor use. It says, that, despite the national policy of the country, which is to prevent easy access to liquor, the FM is attempting to reduce tax, with the intention of promoting the tourism sector. What is more, the GMOA is proposing a total ban on alcohol in the country. GMOA spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda says the FM's move would destroy the values of the country and encourage alcoholism.
To begin with, there is no official intimation yet from the FM that tax would be reduced on alcohol. The budget is three weeks away. Perhaps, the GMOA is going on the basis of what the Minister stated on an earlier occasion to the effect that we were adopting a hypocritical policy with regard to liquor and that liquor consumption on Poya Days were much higher that on normal days.
Be that as it may, the GMOA is not in a position to preach about upholding values (through the ban of liquor in the country) when it has kicked against the value attached to the Hippocratic oath, by causing misery and hardship to the poor innocent patients, by resorting to wildcat strikes, while some of its members engage in private practice, at the same time.
The doctors cannot be unaware that an imbiber will continue to hit the bottle whether liquor prices go up or down. Once an addict always an addict .It is in very rare instances that an alcoholic will kick the habit. By the same token, it is foolish to suggest that reducing the price of liquor will drive more people to take to the bottle. Who has heard of non-smokers going for the puff, even though the price of cigarettes is only a fraction of the price of liquor Of course, reducing the price of hard liquor may drive imbibers to increase their quantum, which, however, will keep excise revenue on an even keel. But, consuming an alcoholic drink, prepared under proper standards, would be less harmful than going for the rotgut (kassippu), which is more damaging and injurious to health.
Tourists will anyway have their drink, notwithstanding the price. Hence, the GMOA's argument that the tax reduction of liquor is with the intention of encouraging tourism is untenable. This (encouraging tourism) could not have been government's intention, but if liquor prices are to be reduced, as the GMOA contends, it would be a bold move on the part of the Finance Minister, who has a reputation for the unconventional.
We say this, because, all governments, in the past, have only paid lip service towards discouraging liquor consumption, though making pious pronouncements. The fact remains that the government earns the bulk of its revenue from excise duties and would not want to kill the goose that lays the gold egg. The mathata titha of Mahinda Rajapaksa was a misnomer, because, as one wag put it, it was tithata matha (drinking spree) at the time, with Wine Stores even opened near schools and places of worship.The late Jeyaraj Fernandopulle once told parliament that he would request the government not to impose mathata titha in his domain, since the locals commence the day after downing a couple, dekak dala thamai dawasa patanganne. The late Harold Herath, who also represented an electorate, renowned for its boozers, once wanted the manufacture of local arrack to be made a cottage industry, which, of course, drew a broadside from President Premadasa.
Be that as it may, the GMOA should first put it's own house in order before assuming the role of moral crusader. It's members should stick to their sacred duty of caring for the sick, before trying to redeem the country from the vice of alcohol. Moreover, they should cease working to the political agendas of defeated leaders, if their gratuitous advice is to be taken seriously by the government.

Port City steaming on - Ranawaka
Fifty percent of the sea sand reclamation of the total sand requirement of the Colombo Port City is complete now, Megalopolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
Ranawaka said the project is progressing on time and 35 percent of the total requirement of the delivery of rock material is complete while 30 percent of construction of precast concrete elements is over. He also added that 20 percent of the ground improvement work of the reclaimed area is also completed.
He made these observations during a press conference held at the Colombo Port City premises.
Minister Ranawaka said sand reclamation of 269 hectares in Colombo Port City will be completed by 2019. He added that the expressway from Katunayake will be extended from the Kelaniya Bridge upto the Colombo Port City entrance as a flyover and then the same will be connected to the Marine Drive.
The expressway will run underground from near Galle Face Hotel and connected onto the Marine Drive near the Colpetty railway station.
The Galle Face Green will be extended as a result of the sand reclamation project benefiting people.
Minister Ranawaka responding to a query said that so far no Memorandum of Understanding have been signed for the construction of the Smart Buildings in the Colombo Port City, but only proposals.
After the completion of the reclamation work, the President has to declare this area as a part of Sri Lanka and then he will ask us to declare the same area as a special area of Urban Development, Minister Ranawaka said.
Thereafter the Sri Lankan Government and the Chinese partners will be able to call for construction. No government agency other than the President and the UDA is entitled to enter into MOU or such agreements in this connection, he said.
Ranawaka said the Prime Ministers Office is working on the legal basis and the other soft part of this project to formalised under a new legal and tax system. But the entire real state business is done by the Megalopolis Ministry, Minister Ranawaka said.
Colombo Port City Project Director Nihal Fernando said fishermens issues have been solved under the Livelihood Improvement Programme but some who claim to be fishermen attempt to create issues.

Power sharing, only way forward: Dayasiri
A final solution to the national question can only be brought through power sharing. If it fails this time, all extremist groups which fought against it should take responsibility, said co-Cabinet Spokesperson Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara.
Addressing the weekly Cabinet media briefing at the Government Information Department, the Minister made it clear that if the opponents against a new Constitution had a better method to solve the ethnic problem, they should then propose it and start working on it.
The Tamil people have a problem in the manner in which power is shared at present. This is the only opportunity we have to sit and discuss it with the Tamil people, said Minister Jayasekara answering questions as to how the government would proceed with the Constitution given the current opposition to it from the clergy and certain political groups.
He added that they would only agree to power devolution within a unitary state.President Maithripala Sirisena and his rainbow coalition contested the January 8 election in 2015 under the platform of introducing changes to the existing Constitution and with the promise of abolishing the Executive Presidency, said the minister.
Thereafter, a Constituent Assembly was established to set about drafting a new Constitution. The Public Representations Committee on Constitutional Reform headed by Lal Wijenayake travelled to the 25 districts asking people what they want in a new Constitution. The minister questioned as to why the present opponents did not make their views known to Wijenayakes committee then.
Dayasiri pointed out that the recent report on the draft Constitution was only a collection of viewpoints forwarded by all political parties and that it was not the final draft of the Constitution.
We dont even have a draft yet and certain people are against it. We need to sit down and write it and then we can resolve many of the issues, he said.
We have a problem with reconciliation. With regard to devolution, we have issues with our Provincial Councils even in the South. For example, if the Provincial Council wants to put a new bus to a village, the permit is needed from the National Transport Commission which has no idea about regional issues. So we have many problems. Chief Ministers around the country have pointed out problems.
Problems exist not only in the North but also in the South when Governors interfere, added the minister.Dayasiri explained that failure to resolve the issue now would provide incentive to Tamil extremists to push their cause further and silence moderate Tamil politicians once again.
Commenting on the stance of the clergy, the minister said the President had previously discussed the matter with the Mahanayakas and that they would have to speak to the clergy once again to clarify doubts.

Racist, offensive comments on new Constitution: Mangala takes Kamal  and Wimal to task
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday severely criticized Retired Major General Kamal Gunaratne and Parliamentarian Wimal Weerawansa over their violent and offensive comments on the new Constitution.
The minister in a strongly worded statement accused them of acting as pawns of former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. He reiterated that the Viyath Maga movement was formed to cater to the future political aspiration of Gotabhaya Rajapaksa. The Minister reminded that the unity government received a clear mandate in 2015 to introduce a new Constitution to usher in permanent peace, reconciliation and development.
Also citing Gunaratne and Retired Rear Admiral Sarath Weerasekaras recent comments that all who support the new Constitution must be killed and the most recent comment by Weerawansa that Parliament should be bombed, pointed out these horrific comments were made at a time the government is working towards delivering this undertaking of formulating a new Constitution.
We need not reply to filthy statements of racists, yet I should voice the concerns of democracy-loving people who stand against the barking of those blood thirty and power hungry political elements. If they can make such gory comments on a civil platform when they are out of power, people with some sense could imagine the crimes they had committed when they held ruling power. These threats also put the lives of democracy-loving and wise people at risk, Minister Samaraweera stated.
The minister went on to say that Kamal Gunaratne in his recent book had betrayed the Sri Lanka Army by illustrating the fatal attacks on the Northern people and instances of looting their property and thus preparing the ground for war crimes allegations. He reminded that the investigations are still on against Gunaratne over a mysterious death of a Sri Lankan occurred when Gunaratne was in the diplomatic service.
Samaraweera, commenting on Weerawansas statement on bombing Parliament, said Weerawansa had displayed his fanatic political hooliganism following the same footsteps of his brother-in-law who bombed Parliament in the 1988-89 era.
The minister, recalling the infamous white van culture in the Rajapaksa era, noted that the criminal mindset of those in the Rajapaksa camp remains unchanged with or without power.
The minister stressed that no one could stop the ongoing efforts of the government to usher peace and reconciliation and develop the country.

Relax, Malalas jeans arent  an assault on your national identity
A new photo of MalalaYousafzai recently surfaced on the internet, in which the 20-year-old education rights activist can be seen wearing jeans and heeled boots. This caused a furor among many Pakistanis, and resulted in personal attacks and criticism online.
This is not the first time Malala, who recently started studying at Oxford University, has been at the receiving end of criticism from people in her home country for supposedly defying cultural norms.
The fact that she is now being lambasted for wearing a Western dress and being unaccompanied by her father should come as no surprise.
Muslim women in Pakistan are perceived by many to be the guardians of culture and honour, without actually being given a choice in the matter.
Their bodies are continuously associated with controversy and shame, as a result of which successful women like Malala are made to carry the weight of the reputation of not only religious values, but also of Pakistan, on their shoulders.
The concept of culture in Pakistan is continuously conflated with a monolithic perception of religion and nation, and a Pakistani womans free will to decide what to wear is often demeaned as a result.
The obsession of many Pakistanis to police women and the way they dress stems from their perception of womens bodies as private. This is why violence against women is seen as a matter worth concealing in Pakistan.
A visible marker
Women themselves are not even supposed to leave the confines of their home. Overreaching these bounds can always lead to harmful, but justified, repercussions in the eyes of many Pakistanis.
Malala, however, has consistently been seeing as defying such cultural norms, while also challenging the premise of a nationhood that relies on a womans honour, thereby breaking out of the notions of chaadar and chaardewari that so many men in Pakistan hold onto for dear life.
Zia ul-Haqs policies that served to subjugate Pakistani women have left a lasting impact much to the detriment of the rights of women in the country. This has led to everyday institutional injustices meted out against women, fueled by not only by religious but also jingoistic identity clashes.
That is why even the violence afflicted on Malala five years ago is ignored, as violence against women is seen as something that resides in the private domain of our lives, at the expense of our lives and sanity.
Malala has risen above all this, which gives the men of Pakistan a lot of cause for insecurity. Hence, be it unsolicited advice, widespread criticism, moral and body policing, or even assault, women like Malala are always asking for it according to such men.
This goes to show how the Pakistani state has actively encouraged the regulation and surveillance of womens bodies, be it through the laws imposed through the Hudood Ordinance that have still not been rectified fully to this day, or the dress codes that are now being imposed in universities across Pakistan.
Furthermore, shalwarkameez has grown to become a symbol of a religious form of nationalism. Somehow, it has become a visible marker of a Pakistani Muslims identity, a choice emblematic of traditions and honour.
Views echoing such sentiments fail to take into account the malleable nature of culture, and end up promoting cultural homogeneity over diversity. Shalwarkameez was never a quintessentially Muslim dress, but rather its veneration by Pakistani men represents state control over womens bodies at the expense of their agency.
In fact, the criticism of jeans is not against a kind of fabric; her critics think that her individualistic choices come at the expense of her responsibility as the custodian of the countrys honour.
Thereby, she is walking over the fragile reputation of her countrymen, which rests on Pakistani women maintaining an air of conservatism, as per societal norms, while representing the country abroad.
It is very clear that such narratives of nationhood exist at the expense of the bodily autonomy and mobility of Pakistani women, thereby leading to the politicisation of female bodies.
Cultural anxieties
Pakistanis are prone to using women as easy political targets to vent cultural anxiety, be it towards Mahira Khan smoking or Malala wearing jeans outside of Pakistan. We thrive on not the display, but the decimation of a woman, for the sake of a spectacle.
In conclusion, the autonomy of Pakistani women is perceived to be a threat to the religious and national integrity of Pakistanis for many reasons. This is why Pakistani womens bodies happen to be where patriarchy is at control the most: at home.
This also holds true in light of the visceral responses often levelled at Malala and her personal choices. Her independence, according to many Pakistanis, comes at the expense of the countrys reputation that rests on many things, including the need to conceal and exercise control over female bodies.
Such reactions speak of the larger cultural anxieties among Pakistanis that lead to violence against women all over the country. Nevertheless, Malala continues to stand tall, above and beyond the countrys patriarchal mindset, wherever she goes. -images.dawn.com

In Sri Lanka, continuing with their trend of pioneering innovative digital banking solutions, Sampath Bank is poised to revolutionize the financial industry with a banking robot that works in the form of a humanoid teller.
A never before in Sri Lanka phenomenon, the robot uses artificial intelligence to understand customers requests and perform transactions. It detects the presence of a customer and automatically initiates a conversation.
Currently the humanoid teller can speak and understand English and can perform seven functions: cash withdrawals, account balances, exchange rates, interest rates, details of loans and credit cards and information on how to open an account.
With customer service and convenience foremost amongst the priorities of Sampath Bank, the robot is a part of their active digitalization initiatives.
The humanoid teller will be programmed to perform more functions upon studying the customer requirements further. The bank is also planning to include Sinhala and Tamil language capabilities in the coming months.
Currently robot banking is available at the Sampath Bank, headquarters branch in Colombo 02.
Speaking on the new project, Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando said, Technological innovations will be at the heart of the banking industry for years to come. We are committed to delivering a seamless digital platform and easy to navigate services to our customers. Living up to our pioneering spirit, we are proud to introduce robot banking services that will no doubt add more convenience whilst taking the countrys banking and finance industry forward.
Group Chief Information Officer Ajith Salgado said, We are witnessing a new and exciting era in financial service history, which is centered around customers emerging needs. To this end, Sampath Bank has taken great strides forward with the introduction of the first banking robot, a landmark in banking industry.
Basking in the glory of this powerful new innovation, the bank takes time to look back on the many firsts that have placed them in the leadership position they are in today.
Since its inception over 30 years ago, Sampath Bank has introduced Sri Lanka to many firsts based on the concepts of modern banking through a combination of innovative thinking and harnessing the powers of modern technology. Today it has emerged as one of the most progressive and forward thinking banks in Sri Lanka.
While focusing on keeping abreast with global banking trends, Sampath Bank pays close attention to the needs, requirements and evolving lifestyles of its customers and is constantly developing new avenues to take its products and services to them, through simplified processes and digital solutions.
The banks other main product innovations include the launch of Sri Lankas first foreign currency exchange ATM which allows the exchange of US dollars and Euro notes to Sri Lankan rupees as well as the Sampath mobile app which allows customers to conduct transactions on their smartphones. Sampath Bank auspiciously began this year with the launch of 10 digital products designed to save the customer time and money.
They are also proudly celebrating 30 years of sterling service and offering futuristic banking options to the Sri Lankan public this year. Revolutionizing the banking sector is foremost in their mind and this new foray into the robotic era sets the bank firmly ahead of the rest.

Saudis plan to build $500bn mega city and business zone
Saudi Arabia has unveiled plans to build a new city and business zone - a project that will be backed up by more than $500bn (381bn) in investment.
Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman says the 26,500 sq km (10,232 sq mile) NEOM zone will be developed in the north-west, extending to Egypt and Jordan.
It will focus on nine sectors including food technology and, energy and water.
The crown prince has been leading a drive to move Saudi Arabia away from its dependence on oil revenues.
In August, the Gulf kingdom launched a massive tourism development project to turn 50 islands and other sites on the Red Sea into luxury resorts.
However, the extremely ambitious nature of Mohammed bin Salman's vision is sure to raise questions about how realistic it is, the BBC's economics correspondent Andrew Walker says.
Saudi officials said NEOM would be financed "over the coming years" by the state as well as local and international investors.
"NEOM's contribution to the kingdom's GDP is projected to reach at least $100bn by 2030, in addition to its per capita GDP - projected to become the highest in the world," a statement said.
"It is set to become a new vibrant destination" on the coast of the Red Sea and the Gulf of Aqaba, linking Asia, Africa and Europe.
The announcement came at an international business conference in Saudi Arabia's capital Riyadh.
Egypt and Jordan are yet to comment on the new project. (BBC)

## Title: Sir Cyril de Zoysa,  a man of heroic  stature
## Supertitle:

Sir Cyril de Zoysa,  a man of heroic  stature
To understand and appreciate the calibre of Sir Cyril de Zoysa one needs to set him against the historical background of our nation and see how he is a product of the very genes that created our nation. Prince Vijaya of the lion race in India arrived in Sri Lanka along with seven hundred warriors, struck a strategic relationship with a local Princess, Kuveni of the Yaksha race, and brought the state of Lanka under his suzerainty. Historical facts reveal that the Yaksha dynasty was in a state of degeneration for several centuries after the fall of King Ravana, their ancient head of state. By this time their Kingdom of Sireesavastu and that of Lankapura were in a state of deterioration.
It was during such a time that the advent of Vijaya and his band of followers took place. Prince Vijaya succeeded in winning over Kuveni, a descendant of the royal line of King Ravana and through this liaison succeeded in winning over full control of the state of Lanka.
Meanwhile, the Naga Race had made Kelaniya, lying along the Western sea coast, the chief kingdom, while the Deva Race lived in the middle of the country. Between them, there were no open dissensions; yet there was no unity either. For this very reason that the Yaksha, Deva and Naga Races were disunited Prince Vijaya found it opportune to subdue the entire country by capturing the kingdom of the Yaksha Race.
Meanwhile again, after the arrival of Princess Bhaddha-kachchanaa of the Sakya Dynasty in Lanka, large numbers of the Sakya Dynasty under the leadership of some of the Princesss own brothers such as Uruvela, Ramagona, Anuradha, Vijitha, Dheegaayu and Rohana, arrived and settled in Lanka and integrated with the people of the Lion Race. After the arrival of Thera Mahinda or Mihindu in Lanka, Emperor Dharmashoka the Great, dispatched to this country his daughter Sanghamitta along with a retinue of Bhikkunis or Buddhist nuns, with a sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhi or the Great Resplendent Bodhi Tree and with a large retinue belonging to eighteen clans of artisans skilled in different arts.
Buddhist state
All these communities, much impressed by the devotion of the great King Devanampiyatissa and the great Mahinda Maha Thera, sought ordination as Buddhist monks. Accordingly, they were all ordained without discrimination. As a result, the Sinha-Deva-Naga tribes  all  gradually joined the ranks of Buddhist monks along with Bodhigupta who accompanied the Sacred Bo sapling and the eighteen clans of skilled artisans.
Thus seven or eight generations later, all the people, along with the Lion or Sinha tribe that occupied the throne, had imperceptibly become Buddhists. Moreover, owing to such gradual transformation into being Buddhists there was no cause for friction in living together as a community. In the same token, they all became Sinhalese. Meanwhile, in emulation of Sanghamitta, women of all tribes sought and received ordination. She was Anula Devi who took the lead in this matter. From such time onwards, the people of Sri Lanka gradually became the subjects of a Buddhist state.
Development of Kalutara Bodhi
In terms of these historical facts set out so briefly, it is patently clear that the Sinhala race dedicated its very life for the preservation of the word of the Buddha. In the same token, the religious life of Sir Cyril de Zoysa was one of great success. Sir Cyril born in Southern Sri Lanka following the footsteps of the ancient kings and ministers of state spent his wealth, time and knowledge entirely in the cause of sustaining the Sasana.
His religious life was a very special one. Some aspects of this religious life are the Restoration of the Kiri Vehera, the development of the Kalutara Bodhi to become one of the Sacred Places par excellence and the setting up of the Young Mens Buddhist Association (YMBA) Building Complex.
Apart from these, he adopted various measures appropriate for the development and preservation of Homes for Elders, Homes for Children, a Ward exclusively for sick Bhikkus, Buddhist schools and other such. These should be perceived as some aspects of his intellectual ability. His political life too was a rich one. He served for some years as a member of the Upper House of Parliament viz. the Senate, then as its President and thus as an exemplary politician.
It has to be imperatively asserted that, as stated at the very outset of this piece of writing, Sir Cyril de Zoysa who held positions of dignity and responsibility moving right up to that of the President of the Senate, and the boundless services rendered by him are a result of the power and strength of the genes of the Sinhala people carried through thousands of years.

Although such members sacked for infidelity are making various pronouncements after their sacking, the public know that they were trying to promote the Pohottu Party (SLPP) while remaining within SLFP ranks earlier.
Dissanayake made this observation addressing a press conference held at his residence following a meeting of SLFP Kandy district electoral organisers recently.
Dissanayake said people have broken away from SLFP ranks on four previous occasions in its history.
When compared with previous groups which had parted from the SLFP earlier, the recent group seemed to be the weakest group. He said the departure of a senior party member had created the opportunity for an efficient junior group of SLFPers to come forward and display their mettle.

The newest programme in our product portfolio, the Certificate in Digital Marketing (CDM), launched in 2017, is testament to this.

SLIM CEO/Executive Director, Sanath Senanayake said that SLIM has reached the zenith as a mentoring entity with endorsements from the Sri Lankan marketing fraternity that includes the corporate sector.
For 47 years, SLIM has endeavoured to fulfil its vision of leading the nation towards prosperity by positioning Marketing as a key driver of the economic growth.

SPC supervisory  councillors under criticism
The conduct and performances towards the public by ministry supervisory councillors of the Southern Provincial Council were reproached by JVP Councillor Nalin Hewage at a council meeting held on Tuesday.
The Councillor was critical in response to a report submitted by Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva related to a written question raised with regard to the ministry supervisory Councillors appointed by the Provincial Chief Secretary on recommendations of the council.
The Chief Minister submitted to the house, a list of 29 ministry supervisory Councillors appointed by the council as per its Cabinet resolution number 721/1 dated November 12, 2015. He also revealed details of the allowances paid to each of them.
Councillor Nalin Hewage said that payment of an additional allowance to them was a waste of public funds and appointment of a selected number of members as ministry supervisory Councillors without the knowledge of other members was unfair and undemocratic.
Councillors Channa Saliya Mendis and Chamly Withanachchi, who are noted as Joint Opposition loyalists, reacted to the JVP Councillors statement, stating that the respective allowances they receive were judicious.
"People elect us as their representatives to serve them. We were not informed over the appointment of the ministry supervisory Councillors. On the other hand, the Councillors receive a special budget of Rs 100,000 each for the maintenance of their respective personal offices to serve the people. But none had opened up any office and without spending the special allowance maintain their offices in their homes," Nalin Hewage further said.
The special payment is made to the Councillors for the service they render in supervising the activities of the respective ministries. The supervisory members are appointed from the ruling party. However, on being appointed to the posts as ruling party members, they act in hostility to the ruling fraction as loyalists to the Joint Opposition. This is strange. They stand as ruling party members, but always disrupt functions of the council. We the JVP Councillors support to keep up the required quorum in the House. They sabotage the plans of the councils and launch various campaigns against the council work. But still they get special status as ruling party members. This is a mockery, he added.
He reiterated that appointment of ministry supervisory Councillors is a complete waste of public money, for they do not render any service to the people who elected them. This practice should be stopped forthwith, he said.
Councillor Channa Saliya Mendis said, "What we get as a special allowance is very fair. We get money for the services we render in supervising the functions of respective ministries."
In parliament also there are ministry supervisory members, Councillor Chamly Withanachchi said.
Opposition whip Asoka Dhanwansa said, offering ministry supervisory member posts only to the ruling party members is an infringement of the Opposition Members privileges. Such members should be selected from the United National Party as well.
In the Western and Sabaragamuwa Provincial Councils, opposition members are also appointed as ministry Supervisory members, Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame said.
Chairman K. A. Somawansa chaired the Council meeting.

Sri Lanka to temporarily suspend importation of canned fish

The Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry has decided to temporarily suspend the importation of canned fish and fish varieties - except Koppara and Thalapath - to Sri Lanka due to an increase of local fish harvest, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
During a discussion held today with the fish sellers at the Peliyagoda fish market, they informed the Minister that the fish harvest from the southern sea and other sea areas is increasing gradually these days. As a result of that the price of fish varieties such as Linna, Balaya, Parawa, Kumbalawa, Salaya, Halmessa, Anjilawo has decreased.
With the intention of managing this situation, the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Ministry today made a request to the Finance Ministry to take necessary measures to stop the importation of fish and canned fish.
Currently Sri Lanka is importing around 120,000 metric tons of fish and canned fish.

Sri Lanka Tourism moves into Google - G Suite
Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA), the apex body of Sri Lanka tourism, has moved into G Suite, the cloud based application from Google, to improve its internal communications and to advance the services it offers to the industry  at large.
The SLTDA is one of the first Sri Lankan state sector institutions to move into G suite, a package that can provide a workstation with a whole new way to work together online - not just using email and chat, but over video conferences, social media, real-time document collaborations and many other services.
The solution also covers the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotional Bureau (SLTPB), another institution coming under the Tourism Development and the Christian Religious Affairs Ministry.
The SLTDA is using G-Suite to provide productivity tools to its staff, and also to manage our customers, while connecting them with the staff, said Udana Wickremasinghe, Director ICT of SLTDA.
The SLTDAs direct customer-base includes over 5,000 tourism industry service providers across the country.
The organization, Wickremasinghe said, decided move into a cloud-based platform to enhance performance and efficiency of the internal team by giving them effective tools.
But, we needed to take several factors into consideration. Accessibility and security were of critical importance to us. We needed our members to engage with the system while on the move. Also, Google has the highest uptime in Cloud platforms globally. You cannot simply remember the last time Google was down! That is why we opted to proceed with G Suite, he added. G-Suite integrates seamlessly with our existing platforms and provides mobility and robust security.
As part of the deployment, a workflow solution will be implemented, which is built on Google App Engine code named 'OVERC'. This suite of applications designed to address business needs, automation, operations and services delivered to the tourism industry, with analytics, the Director ICT said, explaining how G Suite will enhance performance of the institution.
The SLTDA, he said, had engaged Sri Lanka's Google partner Finetech Consultancies to support the roll-out of G-Suite, while assisting the organisation through the deployment and driving internal adoption of the new platform. Finetech has previous experience doing over 300+ such deployments in Sri Lanka, Maldives and Bangladesh

Public Enterprise Development Minister Kabir Hashim said he was never involved in the tender process of purchasing LP Gas (LPG) for Litro Gas Lanka Limited (LGLL).
The Minister while refuting certain media reports that the tender procedure to purchase LPG is not transparent, said the entire tender procedure is carried out by the procurement committee and the evaluation committee without his involvement. Minister Hashim was addressing media yesterday in Colombo,said it is up to the procurement and evaluation committees to follow tender procedure.
If it is proved that there is tender procedure malpractices, it will be reversed, the Minister said.
According to certain media reports a bid forwarded by Oman Trading International Ltd (OTI) has not been considered during the tender procedure. Responding to this issue, the Minister said that the OTI had been blacklisted as they violated tender agreements at an earlier occasion in 2014.
However, I instructed Litro Gas officials to reconsider the OTI since Omans Oil and Gas Minister Dr. Mohammad Rumhy told me that the OTI is a state owned venture of the Sultanate.But the transportation charges are high compared with their opponent Shell Gas,Hashim said.
The Minister asked that relevant parties to lodge a complaint with the Cabinet Procurement Appeals Committee maintained at the Presidential Secretariat if they wish there is an injustice or violation of tender procedure by the technical evaluation committee and the procurement committee.
I havent been involved in purchasing LPG for Litro, Minister Hasim noted while refuting the media reports that he has involved in the tender procedure.

Thailand begins royal cremation for late King Bhumibol Adulyadej

Mourners in Thailand are marking the main part of the five-day funeral ceremony for the country's late King Bhumibol Adulyadej.
The revered king died in October 2016 aged 88.
A series of Buddhist rites began in the royal palace before the royal urn was moved onto a chariot to begin a large procession to the cremation site.
The late king will be cremated later on Thursday, in a royal pyre to be lit by his son, King Maha Vajiralongkorn.
The funeral officially started on Wednesday with a merit-making ceremony, a Buddhist rite, in the Grand Palace.
Many buildings in Bangkok's old quarter are draped in yellow marigolds, and huge crowds are lining the streets for the funeral procession.
The chariot carrying the urn in the second part of the funeral procession has been used since the late 18th Century. Weighing just under 14 tonne, it is being pulled by more than 200 soldiers.
The elaborate ceremony is estimated to have drawn as many as 250,000 people from across Thailand.
Many of the mourners arrived at the capital days ago, and waited in the streets overnight for the procession, clutching portraits of the late king.
Thursday has been declared a public holiday, with many businesses shut all day or closing at midday.
Members of royal families and dignitaries from more than 40 countries will attend the cremation.
King Vajiralongkorn will light the funeral pyre at 22:00 local time (15:00 GMT) and his father's ashes will be collected and transported back to the palace on Friday.
Two more days of ceremonies will follow.
The late king was seen as a stabilising figure in a country hit by cycles of political turmoil and multiple coups.
Since his death on 13 October 2016, Thailand has observed a year of official mourning, with many people wearing black.
Preparations for this week's events took almost a year and have included setting up the large cremation complex near the palace.
The funeral site features sculptures of mythical creatures and auspicious animals such as lions and elephants.
According to Buddhist tradition, the funeral rituals are modelled after the universe and the cremation pyre represents a sacred mountain.
The funeral ceremonies come with strict guidelines for those attending. Thailand's lese-majeste law, which forbids any insult to the monarchy, is among the harshest in the world.
Roads across Bangkok's historic centre are shut for the day and while tourists are not expected to wear black like most Thais, they have been asked to dress and behave respectfully.

Boost for Abenomics
Abes third straight victory in a Lower House poll
JAPAN: Abes center-right Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) and coalition partner, Buddhist-backed Komeito, had secured 313 seats in the 465-seat Lower House, passing the 310-barrier for a two-thirds majority necessary for constitutional change.
The LDP alone won 284 seats in Sundays poll, giving it the power to appoint all chairs as well as a majority of members of lower house standing committees. Among the opposition parties, the center-left Constitutional Democratic Party (CDP) secured 55 seats, exceeding the 50 won by Yuriko Koikes Kibo no To (Hope) party, despite earlier expectations of a strong showing by Tokyos first female Governor.
Abes gamble on calling an election more than a year earlier than scheduled paid off, despite pre-election polls showing a slide in his approval rating.
His victory should boost his prospects of winning another three-year term next September as LDP president, which would potentially make the 63-year-old political veteran the nations longest serving postwar leader. I am very grateful that the Japanese public has powerfully encouraged us to move forward with our politics based on the solid foundation of our leadership, Abe told a news conference Monday.
Koike, who had promised to reset Japan, conceded utter defeat by her new populist party, which split the opposition by taking lawmakers from the former Democratic Party. In contrast, CDP leader Yukio Edano said, We have only just started.Analysts attributed Abes third straight victory in a Lower House poll to his strong stance against North Korea.
Victory for the opposition would have seen a very negative reaction from financial markets. This is because it would have likely been a coalition government with weak leadership, instead of the policy stability under Abe, Kamiyama said.

Weerawansas remarks were a tirade against democracy: Wijenaike
National Organizer of the National Freedom Front (NFF), Piyasiri Wijenaike yesterday, denounced the comments made by his own Party leader Wimal Weerawansa MP that a bomb attack should be launched on Parliament.
Addressing a media briefing in Yakkala, former Minister Wijenaike said that he had confronted the NFF Secretary and sought answers to the comments made by Weerawanse.
As the National Organizer of the NFF, I questioned the Party Secretary as to why our leader had made such a comment when the Partys Central Committee had taken no such decision. The comments made by Weerawansa were wrong. I can assure you that the comments made by him were not the Partys view. Maybe they were his personal views, Wijenaike said.
The NFF National Organizer went on to say that Weerawansas remarks were a tirade against democracy.
I think stating that a bomb attack should be launched on the Parliament of a peaceful country is also an attack against democracy. As the National Organizer of the NFF, I say that this comment is wrong, even if it was made by our own party leader. I can assure you that this is not the Partys stance.
Wijenaike also said that as the National Organizer of the NFF, he would wish to apologize to the entire Parliament for the derogatory comments made by one of his party members.
Wijenaike further noted that the comments made by his party leader could be detrimental to the country which was now marching on the path towards peace after defeating the scourge of terrorism which plagued the country for nearly three decades.
Weerawansa's comments have garnered severe criticism from many quarters during the last few days.
Meanwhile, the Speaker has informed that as soon as Parliament meets again, MP Weerawansa's threat would be brought to the Parliament's attention and further action would be taken.
