Chat with Chef Anura
Meet Chef Anura Uduwaraarachchi who is the Executive Sous Chef at Hilton Colombo. He has been serving with Hilton for the past 23 years and has won awards for his amazing culinary art and dishes.
T&C got together with him to know him a little bit more.
Demi H: Your full name and a bit about yourself.
Anura Uduwaraarachchi: My family originally is from Kandy. We moved to Colombo when my grandfather was just a boy. I studied at the Royal College Colombo and started the culinary journey from Inter-Continental as a trainee Chef. Ive been in this profession since 1977 to date.
DH: Why are you a chefAU: Because Ive always wanted to be a one.
DH: What do you feel when you are cooking, creating and working in the kitchenAU: It simply makes me happy
DH: Who is your biggest criticAU: Myself
DH: How do you handle dishes that are rejected and sent back to the kitchen
AU: First of all, I make it a point to personally speak to the guest and see what went wrong. In our industry we treat our guests as kings and queens. I attend to each and every one of them and re-prepare and present the dish to the guest by myself. We never say no.
DH: When at home do you cook or do you let your partner take controlAU: I cook for my family very often. Sometimes I cook with my wife.
DH: If you were not a chef what would you be todayAU: Nothing. I wouldnt have it any other way.
DH: Of all the places you worked, what are your greatest memories of them
AU: Back in 1982, I was working in hotel Meridian, Baghdad, while the Iran-Iraq war was going on, the city was Aerial bombed by Iranian terrorists. The hotel was a 24 storied building and was full house at the time of attack. Most of the guests and employees were foreigners.
We were forced to run towards the bunker they had built right under the base of the building for the safety of staff from frequent terrorist attacks.
I remember watching anti-missiles firing up to the sky from top of the hotel building through the restaurant window while everyone else was running for their lives. But that was not long before one of the Iraqi military officers grabbed me by my neck and forced me in to the bunker for safety.
Given below is a recipe which is a favourite of Chef Anura and very easy to make as well. So why dont you give a go at this and let us know how it turned out.

Dilemma of stored paddy: insect pest infestation
Needles to introduce paddy as the source of our stable food, rice. However, it is quite sorrowful to learn that Sri Lanka is currently experiencing a remarkable loss of stored paddy due to infestation by insects. (See Table)
Present status of paddy farming in Sri Lanka
As the paddy production is seasonal, it is inevitable that the surplus production needs to be stored to meet the demand during the off seasons. Alternatively if paddy is imported, still needs to follow a storage period until released to the market. Although stored paddy is a durable agricultural commodity with low moisture content of about 13%, still it is subjected to deterioration by various external factors.
Studies conducted in Sri Lanka have revealed that nearly 80% of the storage losses of grains are due to insect attack. These losses include the loss of weight, nutrients and germ inability; poor smell and taste; grain discolouration; aggregation of grains; development of fungus; and finally the economic loss due to the reduced market value. This emphasizes as to why insects of stored paddy needs to be treated with top priority. Cleaned, well dried paddy is stored by the farmers either in bags of in bags of in bulk and by adopting good hygiene, the grain is kept insects free. However, in Sri Lanka, the use of insecticides for protection of stored grain in restricted to a small farming population.
As the damage is high, it is important how a farmer, trader or any other grain-handling personnel can detect the insect damage. This, of course, varies with the situation. For instance, a severe insect infestation in bag storage can be identified by a typical sound created when insects move out of the grain mass across the poly sack lining and land on poly sack surfaces. Also the insects are present outside the bags that contain grains. Insects can also be observed in the cracks and crevices of the warehouse.
The pest management entangles with the economy. It needs to be implemented in such a way that revenue gained by attending pest management needs to be higher than amount of money spent on management practices. If the density of insects is not that high, it may not be practicable to apply chemicals at that particular time but needs to monitor the fluctuation of insect population to see if it reaches the threshold level of damage within comparatively a short period due to high reproduction rate of insects. This population increase, of course, is backed by the environmental conditions which differ continuously. High temperature and high conditions favour the increase in the insect population density.
Identification of different insect species is also important as certain stake holders might be unaware of these insects. Rice weevil, lesser grain borer, Saw-toothed grain beetle, Red flour beetle and gain moth are main insect species that infest stored paddy.
Insect species
Rice weevil  Sitophilus oryzae (L)
Adult
about 2.3-4.5 mm in size
easy to identify by the long, narrow snout in the head
reddish brown black weevils
conspicuous, four, light orange-yellow colour spots on front wings
adult lives 4-12 months
Larva
Develop and feed inside the grain kernel undetected from outside
Lesser grain borer  Rhyzopertha dominica (F)
Adult
cylindrical body, 2-3 mm
shiny body, dark brown or black
front wings bear rows of small punctures
long lived (about three years)
live on grain surfaces or inside kernels, more active in the evening
one adult female lays 200-500 eggs loosely attached to grain, difficult to observe with the naked eye
Larva
Creamy white in colour and bear legs
Lives inside grain kernel
Angoumois grain moth_ Sitotroga cerealella
Adult
light, yellow brown, 8-10 mm long
fore wings pale brown-orange and often with a pale black spot in the distal half
wing span 10-15 mm
hind wings have a long fringe of hairs on the posterior margin
hairs on wings are longer than half the width of the wing
female lays tiny eggs singly or in clumps on the grain; impossible to observe eggs by the naked eye
Upon the egg hatching, the larvae bore into the grain
Pupa
Pupa lives inside the grain
Adults emerge from the infested seeds; emergence holes can be observed on the grains
Damaged seeds
Besides these species, the grain mites also attack stored paddy. All these insects and mites are small (about 3-4 mm), and hence may not be easily detected. Some insect species spend their life stages (eggs, larvae and pupae) inside the grain and makes it more difficult to detect. These insects are long lived (more than one year except the moths) and one insect female adult produces large number of eggs (a few hundreds) during its life time. These features aggravate the damage done by the alleged insects, and until destroyed the insects continue their role to destroy the stored paddy.
What can we do to reduce this damage
Synthetic chemical has to be used is when the insect population is increased at a higher rate which is difficult to be suppressed by non-chemical methods. There are steps that we can adopt to prevent the insects being infested into to stored paddy/other grains. These include cleaning of the store before the intake of grains, clean the wooden structures on which the paddy is stacked, use of clean packing materials, drying of grains well before being stored, proper maintenance of a store, regular inspection of stored paddy. These initial steps may hinder the insect population build up and consequently the necessity of pest management. Margosa and Citrus leaves are kept in the Bins or bags to repel the insects. Wood ash obtained from the kitchen is mixed with paddy by some farmers in addition to the use of leaves. Certain farmers resort to insecticidal sprays on the surface of bags and for that purpose the insecticide Actellic 50 EC is used. Besides the emulsifiable concentrate some farmers use actellic dust to protect bagged grain from insect. However, if the insect population is built up to higher levels, treatments may be necessary. Actellic 50% EC which contains the active ingredient, Pirimiphos  methyl is applied at a dilution of 1:150 as high volume sprays on the surface of bags and the entire warehouses.
Pirimiphos Methyl 50% EC 50 ml/4.5 l water for 100 m2 surface area of the storage bags (poly sacks). Spray insecticide in the evening.
Phoxim 500g/1 EC  31 ml/10 l water. Treat surface of walls and floor at 5-10l/100 m2. Spray insecticide in the evening Bags should be turned be turned inside out and sprayed insecticide and air dried before use.
This treatment reduces the population of insects considerably. Spraying is done at least once in 3 weeks. In addition to spraying, warehouse is fogged with Actellic 50 EC at a dose of 120-240 ml per 4 liters of diesel. If the insect population cannot be reduced by fogging, the grain is fumigated by using phosphine gas provided in situ by Magnesium Phosphide plates and Aluminum phosphide tablets. Fumigation is carried out under gas proof sheets when other pest control processes fail to achieve a reasonable level of pest control. 2-3 gram of phosphine gas per ton of grain is used as the standard dose for grain. Pirimiphos methyl is recommended as a contact insecticide and phosphine fumigation can be done by authorized personnel. The contact insecticide has a residual efficacy over a certain period wheras the fumigation by phosphine offers no lasting protection due to the absence of insecticide residues following fumigation. Therefore, for a successful and viable management of insects in stored paddy/grains, the selection and use of methods have to be addressed tactfully. There are still other insecticides at the market that have proven efficacy on these stored-product insects at the laboratory level but have not yet been recommended in Sri Lanka. Moreover, there are some pest management methods used by developed countries for stored-product pests but not yet been tested under Sri Lankan conditions due to the unavoidability of funds resulting from the poor attention given by the local agencies on this burning issue faced by the country. Therefore, it is time alternative chemicals and methods are tested and recommended to reduce this damage caused by insects to stored paddy and other food items.

Do not hold me accountable!
Minister Susil Premajayantha, a seasoned politician who held many important portfolios under two executive presidents has now confined himself to the political activities concerning the SLFP, the main constituent partner of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA). Following his resignation from the post of General Secretary of the UPFA over the National List saga, a dejected Premajayantha now feels he has done enough for the main coalition UPFA to which he served over a decade in the capacity of its General Secretary.
Speaking to the Daily News, he also distanced himself from the allegations of non-payment of money to State-owned media institutions during the last Presidential Election campaign.
Minister Premajyantha holds the Science, Technology and Research ministerial portfolio in the current administration headed by President Maithripala Sirisena after the two main political parties, the UNP and the SLFP, joined hands to form a National Unity Government.
Q: How do you look back at the last General Election and its results
A: It was really a close fight between the UPFA and the UNP. However, there had been an unavoidable situation that led to the gap between the UPFA and UNP at the final results. The UPFA as a party did not have a centrally organized campaign, other than the candidates individual campaigns. During the past 10 years, of course we have had a strong centrally organized election campaign, but alas, this time I could not see such a campaign taking shape as far as the UPFA is concerned. A huge gap between the two parties was notable concerning election advertising. The clear division in the UPFA took a toll on its vote base, as some of our voters refrained from casting their votes due to this reason. The strategies that we adopted were not sufficient enough to cut a lead figure on the campaign.
Q: Some say that the small parties in the UPFA coalition had been the cause for the erosion in the SLFP vote base. How do you analyse this situation
A: I dont agree with that. Other than in the Colombo district, in all other districts the SLFPers led the campaign and they won. Of course in the Colombo district, certain coalition partners had an advantage over SLFPers because of the list. There was no other reason. Five members of the NFF (National Freedom Front) had been accommodated in the list all because of me. As the General Secretary of the UPFA, I wanted to keep all these parties together. Therefore when we prepared the nomination lists for 22 electoral districts we accommodated all these parties and gave them an opportunity.
Q: As the General Secretary of the UPFA since its formation in 2004 until very recently, you had shouldered many national level election campaigns. What was the hardest among them and why
A: The last two elections were the hardest. The General Election was held on August 17, just seven months after the Presidential election in which the UPFA party candidate lost by 468,000 votes to the Common Candidate. In our country, usually the results of one major election follow through the next election held immediately afterwards. That was the past experience. It happened in 1989, 1994, 2004, 2005 and 2010. In all those instances, the party that won the Presidential Election came to power in the General Election that followed within a couple of months. The same phenomenon followed at this occasion too.
This time there were several intricacies as the Common Candidate, who won the Presidential Election, happened to be the General Secretary of the SLFP for a considerable period and he took over the reins of the party subsequent to his victory as the Common Candidate at the Presidential elections. However, the two camps still remain as it was. That is why the JVP was not successful in their bid. It was a fight between two major camps. Most of the voters did not consider a third force.
Q: Ex-President Mahinda Rajapaksa has held the UPFA responsible for the non-payment of bills for advertisements on the ITN during the last Presidential election. How do you respond to this claim
A: It is true that ex-President Rajapaksa was the candidate of the UPFA. Then the non-payment of bills is a civil matter, not a criminal matter. We have to go into details and comment on it. As I am ready to go before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry tomorrow I do not want to comment on this stage, because I have to make the statement there. (The interview was held a day prior to the ministers appearance before the Presidential Commission of Inquiry)
However, a similar issue cropped up with regard to the SLTB. I have been sent a letter by the General Manager of the SLTB asking to pay the balance of Rs 140 million for the buses used by the UPFA supporters during the last Presidential election. Then I wrote to them asking as to who placed the order, and whether there was any agreement, and who had paid the advance. They in return stated in a reply that the UPFA had paid a sum of Rs 50 million as an advance. I also received a reply stating that there had been no agreement and the order had been placed by one who heads one of the Election Committees. The orders had been placed not only by that Committee Chairman, but also by several other people from time to time.
The advance of Rs 50 million had been paid in two instalments, Rs 25 million by the Secretary of the SLFP and the balance of Rs 25 million by another person, not by me. I did not have any connection over the placing of order or payment of advance. Accordingly, my lawyers replied to their letter of demand.
Q: Does this imply that the things got out of your hand during the last Presidential election campaign
A: No, the thing you should know is that usually before we start an election campaign, we have a discussion and then appoint several committees. One committee for advertising, one for media, one for organizing public rallies etc. Once these committees are entrusted with their corresponding jobs, we dont have any control over them. Those committees were appointed not by me. I have not issued any letter to any committee chairman or member appointing them in those respective positions.
I never touched or approved a cent during both elections on behalf of the party. I was not authorized to do so and I did not get a cent from the party.
We had less than Rs 10,000 in the UPFA bank account until very recent. That money was also deposited by me to open the account at that time. Normally for the Presidential Election, the Elections Commissioner pays 50 cents for each vote received by the major parties. Accordingly, after the election I got a cheque from the commissioner amounting to Rs. 2.9 million for the 5.8 votes received. None of the coalition parties contributed to both our previous election campaigns though they have MPs in Parliament.
Q: If the party cannot bear the responsibility for election expenses, ultimately who should take the blame for the heavy losses incurred by the state institutions due to election-related activities
A: It is up to those institutions. Speaking with regard to advertisements, the orders were placed not by the individuals. That task was entrusted to one of the advertising companies. It was up to that particular institution to enter into agreement with that advertising company and get the money from them. It is totally a civil transaction.
Q: Do you think the UPFA has the peoples mandate to be a part of the National Unity Government
A: The people voted us to form a Government. At any election, all the parties, especially the two major parties, contest to form a Government. When none of the parties get absolute majority, what is the next alternative It is to have a coalition with smaller parties or get a breakaway group from some other party. This time there was a different situation, because the UPFA leader was the President. As the UNP could not get an absolute majority, it could not form a Government without the support of UPFA or a section of it.
On the other hand, according to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, the President has to play a major role forming a Government after the elections. The Prime Minister only nominates the Ministers, but the President has to give the appointment. Therefore, there cannot be a Government without the cohabitation of the both parties led by the President and the Prime Minister.
Q: You were instrumental in giving nominations to ex-President Rajapaksa at the recently concluded election. Now soon after his defeat you have joined with the Government leaving him in the Opposition. Does not this amount to a betrayal
A: It is a myth. I was not instrumental in giving nomination to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. It was a collective decision by the entire UPFA with the knowledge of all its leaders.
I should also explain why I resigned. I resigned not before the election, but one week after the election. I was suspended from my position three days before the election, and was prevented from acting as the UPFA General Secretary by the courts. Therefore my hands were tied. From August 14 to 21, until the National List was out, nobody made any comment over the suspension.
Only after releasing the National List, some of the coalition party representatives made some comments. The situation was totally beyond my control, because I was under suspension and I was prevented from making any statements to media. Therefore it was the duty of the coalition parties, especially who were members of the Executive Committee of the UPFA, to go to courts and challenge the suspension and the prohibition. They did not do that.
Not only that, I met all these coalition leaders on August 18. Some coalition partners said they could not trace me. It was absolute falsehood. On the same day, even before counting the preferential votes in the Colombo District, I went to meet the Elections Commissioner with one of the leaders of a constituent party of the UPFA. This discussion was with regard to the National List and placing my signature on it. Therefore they knew very well what our discussion had been with the Commissioner. Knowing all the facts, either they kept silent or allowed their representatives to make allegations against me.
Something similar happened to former parliamentarian Basil Rajapaksa. After the Presidential Election, most of our coalition partners and some political leaders apportioned the blame on him. However my position is that if not for Basil Rajapaksa the gap between the UPFA and the common candidate could have been much more. Then he resigned from his post as the National Organizer. This is not to say that I followed him, but I thought for myself the intricacies coupled with the emerging situation. If somebody wanted to blame me even after seven days of the election, why should I continue in my position On the one hand there was a suspension and the case was pending, and on the other hand I was blamed publicly without making a proper assessment of the situation and grasping the real facts that led to such a situation.
For the last 10 years, I have handled nomination papers and all the cases against the UPFA by myself for 12 elections including three Presidential Elections, three General Elections, three Provincial Council Elections and three Local Government Elections. There were 173 cases in District Courts, Court of Appeal and Supreme Court. None of the coalition partners gave a cent for these cases.
I am sure if not for me and some of our colleagues we would not have got even 95 seats. Therefore, I thought my duty was over for the UPFA and resigned. Thereafter, I decided to confine my politics to the SLFP. Two representatives of two political parties of the UPFA made public accusations against me. They misled the people, especially our supporters. They are still doing it. It may be because every political party or politician has some ambitions. They want to achieve their targets. They may have their own agenda.
Q: Do you think the voters who voted you in the last election expected you to switch allegiances from ex-president Rajapaksas camp to President Maithripala Sirisenas camp
A: The people voted me because they felt that I have done my job. The SLFP as a party took a decision to have a coalition Government. This is not the first time in our country, where coalition Governments had been made. It is not the SLFPers who criticize us for accepting the positions in the Government.
Q: However, MPs like Bandula Gunawardena, who represent the SLFP, had also severely criticised the move to form a national government. So the criticism also comes from the SLFP members, doesnt it
A: Speaking of Bandula Gunawardena, he was first elected to Parliament in 1989 from the MEP. Then he lost in 1994 because the MEP contested separately. Then he was again elected in 2000 representing the MEP, but crossed over to the UNP and held portfolios of Ranil Wickremesinghes Government in 2001 until 2004. In 2004, he was elected from the UNP. Then in 2007 while representing the UNP he joined Mahinda Rajapaksas Government and accepted portfolios. He contested under the UPFA only in 2010.
In all the occasions I mentioned above, he took his personal decisions. However, todays situation is far different. We have not taken individual decisions, but a party decision. That is the difference between Bandula Gunawardena and those who accepted ministerial posts of the coalition Government.
Q: Are you satisfied with the ministerial post you received
A: I never asked for one particular subject. Since 2000, I have held so many portfolios. This is a different field, where I have to work mostly together with academics and professionals. So I like it.

D.V. Upul allowed to leave country
UPFA Southern Provincial Council Minister D.V. Upul who allegedly made threatening remarks to Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID) officers was yesterday allowed to leave the country by the Colombo Chief Magistrate until the next Court hearing date.
When the case came up before Chief Magistrate Gihan Pilapitiya, the counsel who appeared for the suspect made a request that his client be permitted to leave the country.
Accordingly, he was permitted to leave the country until November 12. The case was also fixed for the same date.
At a previous occasion, the Court issued an order on the Controller of the Immigration and Emigration to prevent Upul leaving the country.
Addressing a public gathering on May 31, he had allegedly threatened to stone to death FCID officers once Mahinda Rajapaksa returned to power as the Prime Minister.
The CID launched an investigation into the statement made by Upul.
The Provincial Council minister made this remark in the presence of UPFA parliamentarian Namal Rajapaksa and several other politicians representing the Hambantota district. "Collect the name-list of FCID officers from the police constable to the DIG. They should be stoned to death when Mahinda Rajapaksa becomes Prime Minister. We are waiting till that day arrives. If someone in the government opposes that, we will take to the streets against the government," Upul told the gathering.

Exotic East's rare collection of iconic heritage hotels
Some of the most elegant and historic cultural icons of our times - vintage hotels - have withstood the ravages of time to emerge as icons, imbued with a regal charm that is unparalleled. These are some of the heritage hotels around the world, which enjoy an exalted status as the ultimate vintage luxury destinations of all time. These architectural gems were discovered around the time the Suez Canal was opened for transatlantic steamers in 1869, thereby shortening the journey from the West to the East and promoting the early version of tourism as we know it today.
The Galle Face Hotel is privileged to be counted amongst one of these elite properties. The hotel stands proud as one of the oldest hotels east of the Suez in this exclusive group.
Founded in 1864, the Galle Face Hotel is one of the landmarks in Asia with a rich colonial history and is arguably one of the best heritage hotels in the world. It was originally built by four British entrepreneurs and is among the few remaining colonial hotels in operation today in Asia. In 2012 it became the first hotel in the country to be featured on a postage stamp. No visit to Sri Lanka is complete without staying at the elegant historic award winning hotel, which reflects the grandeur of a bygone era yet offering modern comfort for today's traveler. Despite many renovations over the years, the period detail of the Hotel has been preserved in its architecture and faade.
Over the years, the hotel has housed royalty, celebrity and has played host to many well-known figures, world leaders and celebrities who have resided here, including royalty and heads of state, such as Emperor Hirohito of Japan, US President Richard Nixon, Alfonso XIII King of Spain, Pope John Paul II, HRH Prince Phillip Duke of Edinburgh and Indian Prime Ministers Indira Gandhi and Pandit Jawaharlal Nehru and many more eminent personalities.
The hotel has also played host to famous sporting personalities of yore such as Sir Donald Bradman, Sir Garfield Sobers, Sir Len Hutton and Mike Brearley.
Many reputed performers, artists and thespians have graced its portals, such as Somerset Maugham, Duke Ellington, Sir Carol Reed, Robert Rauschenberg, Steven Spielberg, Actors Gregory Peck, Bo Derek, Harrison Ford, Roger Moore, Sir Alec Guinness, Vivien Leigh, Peter Finch, William Holden and Carrie Fisher. The list of the others of our ilk reads like a veritable 'Who's Who' in vintage luxury:
The Raffles, Singapore, a stately mansion, opened its doors in 1887 and even today epitomizes the romance of the Far East - an intoxicating blend of luxury, history and colonial design. The hotel houses the legendary fine dining establishment, Raffles Grill; Long Bar, where the famous Singapore Sling was created; and Writers Bar, a tribute to the novelists and travel writers, who have become part of the hotel's legend.
In neighbouring Malaysia, The Eastern & Oriental Hotel, which was established in 1885, has been simply known as 'The E&O' to generations of travellers. It has stood as a testament to the grand elegance of the British colonial era.
Another gem, The Hotel Metropole Hanoi, was built in 1901 by two private French investors, with the hotel quickly becoming the rendezvous point for colonial society in the first half of the century.
The next gem can be discovered in Myanmar. Declared "the finest hostelry East of Suez" by John Murray in his Handbook for Travelers written in the early 20th century, the 1901-built three-storey 5-star Strand Myanmar hotel in Yangon remains one of the Southeast Asia's few grand colonial hotels and one of its most awe inspiring. It was built in 1901 by the ambitious Sarkies brothers.
Closer home, the Imperial Hotel India was conceptualised in 1934 by Blomfield and inaugurated by Lord Willingdon in 1936, The Imperial is a fine confluence of a rich historical past and a slick international appeal. It was the first amongst the legendary 'Four Maidens of the East', which some say included The Strand hotel in Rangoon, Raffles Hotel in Singapore and The Great Eastern & The Oriental in Calcutta.
To be counted amongst such peerless properties is an honour for the Galle Face Hotel. The irresistible charm of the Galle Face Hotel in its newly refurbished avatar which retains the vintage, colonial ambience and faade is an icon that stands apart from modern counterparts. Its elegance, charm and timeless history make it the jewel of Sri Lanka.

Health and education allocations to be upped in next budget
Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said three percent of the GDP will be allocated for the health sector and six percent for education in the next budget.
Only 1.2 percent is allocated for health and a mere 1.5 percent for education, the minister added.
The government will make several crucial decisions soon to solve several issue in the education and health sectors.
He expressed these views while addressing the gathering during a World Children's Day event at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital, Colombo yesterday.
According to Dr. Senaratne, private tuition classes which are aimed at school children are similar to communicable disease and there will be private tuition classes even for pre-school children in the future if the trend continues. "Children also need democracy," he said.
"Do not bribe the gods. Treat children well. Only then the gods will shower their blessings."

Ireland can be lucky this time, says Wood
Ireland have never reached a Rugby World Cup semi-final but former captain Keith Wood believes they can win the trophy if they beat France in their final pool match.
The Irish have still to play Italy and France the Canadians. But both should reach their high stakes Cardiff showdown on October 11 unbeaten.
Barring huge upsets, the loser of the contest will get a fearsome quarter final clash against defending champions New Zealand who are storming to first place in Pool C. The winner would likely get an easier task against Argentina.
However, 2001 World Player of the Year Wood -- who bowed out of Test rugby with a 2003 quarter-final loss to France -- said the Irish under coach Joe Schmidt have the quality to make a big impact on the tournament.
New Zealander Schmidt has in just two years turned Ireland from a demoralised unit into the winners of two successive Six Nations titles with notable wins over southern hemisphere giants Australia and South Africa.
"I think this competition is all about the game with France," said Wood, an ambassador for tournament sponsor Mastercard.
"The Irish are expected to win their first three games and if they win against France or lose to France there will be just a couple of points in it. AFP

Many dogs left vaccine free
Sri Lanka has a canine population of nearly two million. Only 50 percent are immunised. It is targeted to reach at least 70 percent shortly, said Animal Production and Health Department Director General D. R. T. G. Ratnayake.
He was addressing a press conference at the Gannoruwa Institute of Continuous Education Auditorium to mark World Hydrophobia Day.
He said nearly 70,000 people succumb to hydrophobia every year throughout the world. The disease is rampant in countries in the SAARC region.
India records nearly 20,000 deaths annually, he said.
Ratnayake said Sri Lanka has been able to restrict the annual hydrophobia deaths to around 20. It is hoped to eliminate the disease by 2020. He said the government spent Rs. 500 million annually to control the spread of hydrophobia.
Nearly Rs. 400 million was spent for the vaccination of people bitten by dogs.

New York City at greater flood risk amid global warming
US: New York City faces an increased risk of flooding, similar to what occurred during Superstorm Sandy in 2012, as global warming causes more frequent storms and sea levels to rise, scientists said.
Researchers reported that mega-storms on America's northeast coast could begin occurring every 25 years or so, compared to every 500 years before industrialization, in a study out Tuesday.
And the scientists pegged the blame on global warming from greenhouse gas emissions caused by human activity. The research was carried out by studying marine sediment and computer models that allowed the researchers to observe the frequency and power of hurricanes in the North Atlantic from the year 850 to 1800.
The researchers were then able to compare those results with data from 1970-2005, according to the study in the latest edition of the Proceedings of the American Academy of Sciences (PNAS).
The researchers concluded that the storm surge, or rise of water caused by a storm, was on average four feet (1.24 meters) higher during the recent 30-year period, compared with the nearly 1,000-year period.
This, they said, was primarily the result of rising sea level.
"Sea level is rising because of climate change," said Michael Mann, a co-author of the study and professor of meteorology at Penn State University.
"But climate change also appears to be leading to larger and more intense tropical storms," he added. The flooding caused by Sandy was the result of several factors: rising ocean levels, high tide and especially the storm's overall size, the researchers said.
"We wanted to look at the impact of climate change on sea level and storm characteristics to see how that has affected the storm surge on the Atlantic coast, specifically in New York City," said Andra Reed, a graduate student in meteorology at Penn State and the study's lead author.
"Sandy was the motivating factor," she said. The superstorm, which devastated swaths of New York and New Jersey when it struck on October 30, 2012, killed 132 people and caused billions of dollars in damage.
A large number of road and subway tunnels were flooded after storm waters breached Manhattan's southern tip at Battery Park.
In late August, NASA scientists said that sea levels were rising around the world, and the latest satellite data suggests that three feet (one meter) or more is unavoidable in the next 100-200 years. - AFP

Over 350 paddlers for CP table tennis championships
Over 350 paddlers under the various age groups and the two open events have entered the Second Central Table Tennis Championship organised by the Kandy District Table Tennis Association which will be worked off at the Jagath Rajapakse International Table Tennis Stadium, Doluwa this Saturday and Sunday (October 3 and 4 with play commencing at 8 am each day.
This is the second Central Province table tennis championship organised by this District Association and the earlier one was worked off last month said the Honorary Secretary of the KDTTA Ms Dilmini Direcksz.
The events which are expected to be worked off are boys and girls under 8, under 10, under 12, under 15, under 18 and the open event for men and women.
A much looked forward event will be the Ladies Open event in which the defending champion is 14 year old Samadhi Hettiarachchi from Mahamaya Girls College, Kandy when she took the last championship by storm by winning this event beating the top contender and former Senior National Ladies Runner up Ridmi Karadanarachchi by the comfortable marging of 3-0 giving her more experienced opponent no chance whatsoever.
This little girl upset Ridmi Karadanarachchi with excellent placement of the ball and also short smashes making her opponent scurry for safety than going for the win.
Others in contention for the title for Ridmi Karadanarachchi, Praveena Silva, Thanushi Rodrigo, Ochini Dissanayake, Sandamini Kularatne, Janani Pushpakumara, Radhushi Jathunarachchi and Navoda Kevindi.
For the open mens title the reigning national Junior and Senior Singles Champion who is also the defending champion should go out as the top favourite. At the last championship be beat Tilina Wijesiri both from Vidyartha College 3-0.
The others in running for the title are Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Dinesh Kavishka, Prasad de Silva, D Karadanarachchi, Krishan Wickremaratne, Chinthaka Ekanayake.
The other top event should be girls under 18 event where te defending champion is Praveena Silva of Girls High School Kandy who scored an easy 3-1 win over Thanushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya Girls College in the finals last month.
The boys under 18 event saw Udaya Ranasinghe scoring a close 3/2 win over Dinesh Kavishka with the national champion being stretched to the last set which he won 12/10. A little more effort by Dinesh Kavishka would have been curtains for the national champion.
Chathura Gunasekera of Sussex College, Kandy is the boys under 15 champion with Shakila Karunaratne of Vidyartha College as runner up winning 3/0.
The others in running are Pium Ekanayake, Anupa Athauda, Harshana Karandawela, Devendra Wijebandara, Chandupa Alahakoon and D Karadanarachchi.
The defending girls champion is the under 15 event is Thanushi Rodrigo of Mahamaya Girls College who beat the open event winner Samadhi Hettiarachchi surprising in a comfortable 3-0 in the finals. Perhaps this defeat saw the best of Samadhi Hettiarachchi come out in the main event.
The others expected to make an impression are Dinithi Dissanayake, Sandunika Hettiarachchi, Poojani Withthachi, Sandamini Kularatne, Janani Pushpakumara, Ochini Dissanayake Samadhi Welagedera and Tharani Galaoda.

UN Human Rights Council Resolution on Sri Lanka
Past history with lessons for the future
The consensus resolution on Sri Lanka at the 30th Session of the Human Rights Council sessions has several passages of note -
Emphasizing the importance of a comprehensive approach to dealing with the past incorporating the full range of judicial and non-judicial measures, individual prosecutions, reparations, truth-seeking, with a view to preventing the recurrence of violations and abuses; allowing for, in a manner consistent with its international obligations, the trial and punishment of those most responsible for the full range of crimes under the general principles of law recognized by the community of nations relevant to violations and abuses of human rights and violations of international humanitarian law (this refers to Article 13 (6), Paragraph 02 of the Constitution of Sri Lanka);
Encourages the Government of Sri Lanka to develop a comprehensive plan and mechanism for preserving all existing records and documentation relating to human rights violations and abuses and violations of international humanitarian law, whether held by public or private institutions.
It makes no reference to the 2009 Resolution at the Council. The importance of which is on that occasion it had reference to the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action Adopted by the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna on June 25,1993 with particular reference to para 1 and 3.The Vienna Declaration states, 'Reaffirming the commitment contained in Article 56 of the Charter of the United Nations to take joint and separate action, placing proper emphasis on developing effective international cooperation for the realization of the purposes set out in Article 55, including universal respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms for all.
My interpretation is that we had hence amongst others agreed in 2009 for the UN and GoSL to jointly and or separately act.
The National Human Rights Action Plan
The Government of Sri Lanka developed National Action Plan firstly, to respond to a call from our people to take stock of the human rights situation in Sri Lanka. Secondly, the National Action Plan was the Government's response to the recommendation of the Vienna Declaration and Programme of Action adopted at the World Conference on Human Rights in Vienna, Austria in 1993. Following the pledge made at the Universal Periodic Review (UPR), the Government commenced the process of developing the Action Plan, through the then Ministry of Disaster Management and Human Rights as the focal agency for action. The National Action Plan was further revised and finalized following the focus group discussions in May 2011. A Cabinet Sub-Committee was to be set up to monitor the implementation of the Plan supported by a Monitoring Committee consisting of senior government officials from across the sectors.
A few select examples of the text within resonates with points which are in the recent UN HR.
Need for review of certain provisions in the Prevention of Terrorism Act in the light of internationally recognized human rights norms and standards which are obligatory on Sri Lanka;
Safety of suspects in custody-Amend Chapter 30 of the Code of Criminal Procedure to provide for Magistrates to: Conduct inquests into all deaths alleged to have been committed by the Police or the Security Forces;
Alleged violations of human rights which appear to be associated with the official location/assignment of certain officers attached to the Police/ security forces;
Alleged disappearances-Code of Criminal Procedure, and the Prevention of Terrorism Act Amended;
Implementation of the zero tolerance policy of the State on torture- Allegations of Torture in custody and places of detention;
Ensure the protection of all persons in custody/detention especially women and children-Conduct study of instances of sexual violence in custody/ detention during the last five years
Justification to look before 2002
The Law and Society Trust publication titled A LEGACY TO REMEMBER; SRI LANKA'S COMMISSIONS OF INQUIRY 1963 - 2002edited by Kishali Pinto-Jayawardena provides graphic details on the work of Commissions of Inquiry from the past. It includes Presidential Commission of Inquiry - incidents which took place between 13 August and 15th September, 1977 (Sansoni Commission, Kokkadicholai Incident, Disappearance of Persons in the Central, North Western, North Central and Uva Provinces, Disappearances of Persons in the Northern and Eastern Provinces, Disappearance of Persons in the Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces, Involuntary Removal and Disappearances of Certain Persons (All Island); Presidential Truth Commission on Ethnic Violence(1981 - 1984).

ICRC shows 16, 137 in their Annual Report 2013 as the number of tracing requests from families of persons who went missing in connection with the conflict from 1990 until December 2013. The numbers and details with the UN working group on Disappearances and Summary executions need to be factored as well as the current UN HR. The toll to life amongst those who died from the LTTE and other militant groups is not recognized distinctly here.
Examples from some reports
Final Report Disappearance of Persons in the Central, North Western, North Central and Uva Provinces
SUMMARY OF FINDINGS:
Fifteen thousand and forty five complaints received, six thousand four hundred and forty three complaints were inquired into and eight thousand six hundred and two complaints were remaining at the conclusion of the Commission. The report includes names of some of those the Commission found to be credibly implicated in involuntary removals/disappearances whilst sending a confidential list under separate cover to the President.
According to the Commission: Most of the complainants do not seem to be interested in receiving compensation, as much as seeing those responsible being punished.... This is particularly so in the case of those complainants who had been involuntarily removed, tortured and released or escaped.... They came before this Commission in the hope that their torturers would be brought to book.
The Final Report cover prosecutions of responsible individuals, compensation without discrimination, scholarships for children of the disappeared, issuance of death certificates, relief for those who escaped death, and relief for those whose property was destroyed.
Final Report Disappearance of Persons in the Northern and Eastern provinces
A list of 48 names of those alleged to be responsible is included. According to the evidence recorded, ninety percent of the removals was ascribed to the security forces - Army, Navy, Air force and the Police. LTTE also was responsible for its own share of removals. Other militant groups also are in the picture. The Report asserts that "on exparte" evidence alone, it cannot decide on the guilt of these people. Hence, proper inquiries have to be undertaken and evidence given by the complainants should stand the scrutiny of cross-examination.
Final Report(s) Disappearance of Persons Western, Southern and Sabaragamuwa Provinces,
The Final Report presents a comprehensive analysis, list of special witnesses summoned (organizations and persons), list of HCA cases where the Magistrate has made findings on responsibility, list of detention camps, a note on advisory bureaus in the UK, district wise breakdown of disappearances (1988 - 1990) on a monthly basis, addresses of complainants, and relationship between the disappeared and complainant. Seven thousand seven hundred and sixty one complaints were inquired into and five hundred and forty two remained at the conclusion of the Commission. The Commission found that seven thousand two hundred and thirty nine complaints were proved. It also notes the Distortion of the Investigations to conceal more than to reveal, and mechanically labeling as 'subversive act' without investigation, were some of the practices of avoidance used in the rare instances where the authorities could not refrain from semblance of an investigation.
An example of a cover up - The case of Richard de Soyza
R's corpse was discovered floating in the sea, with gun-shot injuries through the neck. At the inquest the Magistrate ordered the arrest of a senior police officer identified by R's mother to be one of the abductors of her son. The order was not carried out. On the day R's mother was due to give evidence on oath and be available for cross-examination by the several lawyers for the defense, the representative of the Attorney General stated that he would not be calling her as witness as her evidence was 'irrelevant'. The Magistrate accordingly terminated the proceedings. Files at the Attorney General's Department shows that the AG directed the Inspector-General of Police to 'hold further investigations'. There is no record of further investigations by the police/further directions by the AG. Subversion of justice through distortions in investigations was highlighted through an additional three cases - the Dambarella incident, the Mawarala incident, and the Dickwella incident. These cases are described to demonstrate that non-investigation of cases was "not isolated departures-from-practice or 'excesses.' They exemplify a generalized practice, which in its turn warrants the reasonable inference that this practice denotes a generalized direction NOT to investigate such incident (emphasis original)."
SUMMARY OF RECOMMENDATIONS:
The Southern Commission has one hundred and forty five recommendations categorized in eight sections: (1) relief measures; (2) women; (3) legal proceedings; (4) preventative measures; (5) Habeas Corpus applications; (6) emergency regulations; (7) excavation of mass graves; and (8) complaints remaining to be inquired into.
Operatives implementing the current resolution
The narratives show enormous good work undertaken credibly by domestic commissions. It also shows reason why we cannot begin in 2002. The application of Human Rights cannot suffer from selective amnesia. The abuses seem endemic and reflective of brutal conflicts within the country not confined to the North and East.
The narrative is a devastating indictment of thousands who have disappeared, subsequently aided and abetted by instances of torture and rape and (the text from the National Human Rights Action Plan is proof ) potentially isolated, individually inspired instances attracting international strictures. The impunity seen is the result of foul dissemination of knowledge and application on citizens across the country during times of insurrections.
Our efforts at truth telling and compassion have to be broader if recurrence is to be hopefully prevented. Examples domestic methods of organizing work are exhaustive whilst options for reparation and prosecutions comprehensive, methods of arriving at deductions are also found. Unfortunately our capacity to derail and or avoid prosecutions is also detailed. Given this history, read with passages of Resolutions at the Human Rights Council since 2009 international involvement walking with us in a sensitive manner is unavoidable.

Personalised breast cancer treatment has saved millions
FRANCE: In just three decades, the once monolithic approach to diagnosing and treating breast cancer has become more personalised and less intrusive -- a transformation that likely saved millions of lives, experts say.
From testing methods adapted to an individual's level of risk, better drugs and selective use of chemotherapy, treatment is no longer a one-size-fits-all for some 1.6 million people diagnosed with the disease every year.
"In the past few decades, we have witnessed major changes and improvements in the treatment of breast cancer," Justin Stebbing, a professor in cancer medicine at Imperial College London, told AFP.
Despite advances, breast cancer remains the leading cancer killer of women aged 20-59 worldwide. Every year the disease claims more than half a million lives, according to the World Health Organization.
Taking a bite out of this grim toll through better awareness is the goal of October's Breast Cancer Awareness Month, which will see the Eiffel Tower glow pink, and a fashion show in London starring cancer survivors.
Much has changed since the 1980s, when mastectomy -- or surgical removal of the breast -- was the go-to treatment for all types of breast cancer.
Today's approach prefers to target just the tumour, called a lumpectomy.
Not only are better drugs available, but doctors also have a much better understanding of disease variations between patients, requiring different therapies.
The hormone treatment Tamoxifen, for example, effective against 70 percent of breast cancers, has become key in treating pre-menopausal women since trials in the 1980s.
At the same time, an alternative called Anastrozole is effective in women who have already gone through menopause, said Aine McCarthy, a doctor and spokeswoman for charity group Cancer Research UK. - AFP

Plantation sector employees to get seven perch plot of land
The new government is granting a seven perch plot of land to plantation sector employees to end the line room concept, Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake said.
The minister said only this government was able to find a solution to the plantation sector employees' problem of living in line rooms introduced by colonialists.
He said under the leadership of President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe the issue will be addressed soon.
Dissanayake said each employee becomes a tea smallholder with this grant.
The minister said the employees could sell their harvest to the factory.
Dissanayake said many governments attempted to solve this issue.
He said his father, Gamini Dissanayake also attempted to solve this issue.
The minister made these observations at a press conference at the Plantation Industries Ministry auditorium, Sethsiripaya, Baththaramulla yesterday.
Dissanayake speaking on plantation sector employees' salaries said employees are paid Rs. 550 a day along with several other welfare facilities.
He said although these employees demand a higher salary, it was impossible with the low tea price in the world market today. Dissanayake said the best solution for the issue is to link the salary with productivity. The minister said this was the practice in other countries.
Dissanayake said this matter does not come under his ministry but Trade Unions have to discuss the matter with Plantation Companies and the Labour Ministry.

In a letter addressed to Marapana, the Prisons Officials Collective said: "We as a union are aware that there is no single official within the department with academic and other qualifications necessary to hold the position of Commissioner General of Prisons.
We are also aware of the fact that had any of the commissioners in the fray for the position secures it, that officer would not continue any of the development programmes continued hitherto and spend his time taking political revenge on others who could not help him in his campaign. There would be suspensions and interdiction of service of many officers and transferring them in and out of prisons throughout the country."

He said the government has to pay concessions to the plantation sector when the prices of tea, rubber and coconuts in the world market drop.

He said plantation companies have not paid a single extra cent to the government when they earned profits.
Dissanayake said the government has paid around Rs. 7 billion during the last nine months as concession to this sector.

Tea Virgins
Award winning tea
Everywhere you go in Sri Lanka, it's is different and yet one thing remains the same and that is - a welcoming cup of Ceylon tea and an incredible story of how it was created.
Centuries ago, the ancient Chinese employed only 'virgin' women in the production of white tea. It's a bit hard to find enough virgins for an operation like that today but that doesn't stop niche tea planter and entrepreneur Herman Gunaratne from producing the world's best Virgin White Tea. The magic happens on his low country Handunugoda Estate only thirty-five minutes from Galle Fort. The tea gets its name from the buds whitish appearance caused by the minute silvery-white hairs that grow on it.
The process apparently is not that different from normal tea making but Herman would like, not surprisingly, to keep it a secret. Equipped with numerous medicinal properties and a unique taste, white tea is a rare commodity that is produced in very small amounts every month, but it fetches up to US$1,500 per kilo. If your pockets are deep enough, you can buy it exclusively at the world's most glamorous tea shop in France, Mariage Frres, which is also one of the oldest, set up in Paris in 1854.
Natural High
Hands at the museum
Herman knew when his tea was sent off to be tested for its qualities in Switzerland and came out better than most found in China he was in his own words "cooking on gas." So go on, head south and experience his tea process and take a walk through these amazing plantations, view the museum and I guarantee you will come away feeling you are floating on gas. This is a natural high that has put Sri Lanka on the world map as a premier place for making tea.
Kids learning about tea
Sitting back on his chair sampling different teas with delicious homemade chocolate cake and Herman explaining the differences in how they are made. He talks about the island he loves so much, politics and his passions explaining, "I have spent a lifetime in tea and found that the human story of the industry has amazingly not been told." So now he has created a tea museum with all sorts of fascinating things to look at and even a place to try tea cuisine. "This is my final homage to the industry, that is this island's lifeblood", and as anyone who knows this incredible character will know this is certainly not his last visionary act just another accolade in his brilliant career as both a tea maker and mischievous writer.
Fascinating World
Herman Gunaratne is as well known for his great tea as his writing due to his much acclaimed books - The Suicide Club and The Plantation Raj - both page turners, which give you unique insights into the fascinating world of tea making. The Suicide Club is the extraordinary story of his painstaking rise through the ranks from tea-plucker to estate manager, the working culture of the time, the influence of the British and some strange serendipitous happenings that tipped the balance between good and evil will entertain and amuse you from beginning to end.
Museum with the human factor
The name of the book is a nod to his grandfather's presidency of the Suicide Club, where entire estates and fortunes were lost overnight. His estate is a mile from the Indian Ocean, making it the closest tea plantation in the world to the sea and the land is rich in gemstones, and when I ask him why he does not join the gem world. His response with his usual twinkly eyes is that nothing is more valuable than ones health.
So if you want to learn the secret to living well and staying healthy do visit Handunugoda Estate Tittagalla near Ahangama, and call on 94773290999 or 94777713999 in advance to do a tour of this amazing estate and Hemminway like character, who is appearing in my next book '101 Unforgettable Experiences island wide'.

Tough task for Windies in Sri Lanka
Once the most dominant force in world cricket, the West Indies team arrived in the country yesterday, hoping to put aside their on and off field controversies and to redeem some of their lost prestige during the series against Sri Lanka.
The West Indies led by Jason Holder will start their 44 day tour with a three-day fixture against the Sri Lanka Board President's XI on October 8, at the SSC ground in Maitland Place. The first Test will be played from October 14-18 at the Galle International Stadium.
The second Test will commence on October 22 at the P. Sara Oval in Colombo. The first ODI will be staged on November 1 at the R. Premadasa Stadium followed by the second ODI on November 4 at the same venue.
The third and final ODI will be worked off on November 7 at the Pallekele Stadium which will also host the first Twenty20 match on November 9. The second and final T20 will be held on November 12 at the R. Premadasa Stadium.
The West Indies team, packed with a lot of youngsters will need to get their act together well immediately as they look to bounce back into recognition despite the absence of some of their stalwarts who have contributed immensely in the past few years.
However, the team has been plagued with chaotic mismanagement and rows over player contracts that have pushed them back to a huge extent in the international arena in recent years.
Their biggest setback came a couple days ago when the team failed to qualify for the 2017 Champions Trophy in England after the side was pushed into the ninth position in the ICC ODI Team Rankings.
This will certainly be a huge disappointment for the West Indies ahead of the series against Sri Lanka as the Caribbean islanders are still recovering following the suspension of regular coach Phil Simmons earlier. In fact this will be the first time that the West Indies are missing out from any of cricket's three big limited over events - the 50 over World Cup, Champions Trophy and the T20 World Cup.
The main concern for the West Indies during this series will be the lack of experience in the side with former captain Denesh Ramdin with 69 Tests as the most senior player in the squad.
Marlon Samuels who has made his appearance in a total of 59 Test matches is the second most experienced player while 23 year old skipper Holder (8 Tests) will be making his debut as Test captain.
In fact Holder not only has the tough task of rebuilding the team but also to spearhead the West Indies towards recording the first win in a Test match on Sri Lankan soil.
In nine Test matches, the West Indies have gone through without any success while losing five and drawing four.
SriLankan Airlines flew the West Indies cricket team to the island yesterday. Arriving from London, the cricketers received a warm welcome at the Bandaranaike International Airport.

Towards a Revolution in Compassion
If Sri Lanka is taken to task internationally on lack of statutory recognition of animal rights than on human rights as we see happening today at UNHRC in Geneva we will have nowhere to look. The lack of political will in Sri Lanka to extend effective legislative protection to defenseless animals is unsettling to all those who care for others.
If you teach someone to care and respect animals from a young age to prevent them from ill-treating and harming living beings, the chances are that they are less likely to hurt humans in their adult life, since many in our society start their journey in life by first hurting animals and then human beings and sometimes even engage in mass murder.
A country where once upon a time animals lived freely with man in peaceful co-existence in line with the invaluable advice given by Arahant Mahinda to King Devanampiyatissa at Mihintale 2300 years ago "Oh! Great King, the birds of the air and the beasts have an equal right to live and move about in any part of this land as thou. The land belongs to the peoples and all other beings and thou art only the guardian of it", today imports meat, slaughters animals in the most brutal manner, allows animal sacrifice despite the Buddha's condemnation, encourages exports of fish and meat with hardly any concern for the country's Buddhist image and religious traditions.
Children must be given every chance to learn and practice unconditional love and respect. Animals are great ambassadors. Animal welfare should be part of our landscape and school culture throughout the length and breadth of Sri Lanka.
Children are the country's future. The introduction of animal welfare as a subject into school curriculum in primary and secondary schools in Sri Lanka will be an important step in preventing animal cruelty and will help teach both current and our incoming generations of children precious skills such as Metta (loving kindness) and Karuna (compassion) that will stop deliberate cruelty to innocent creatures.
How they are educated & trained in a wholesome manner will determine the health of the nation both in a moral and ethical sense.
The establishment of a compassionate society in Sri Lanka is an ideal worth pursuing as it sits well with our noble Buddhist civilizational goals of peaceful co- existence between man and animal. It is an ideal path contributing to avoidance of conflict because as the Nobel Prize winner Dr. Albert Schweitzer wisely said "Until he extends his circle of compassion to include all living things, man will not himself find peace".
Attorney-at-Law and Chapter Leader of the Dharma Voices for Animals (Sri Lanka - Colombo) Chapter Senaka Weeraratna will deliver a talk on the topic 'The Importance of introducing Animal Protection Education into Schools in Sri Lanka' on World Animal Day, October 4, 2015 at 5pm at the Dharmavijaya Foundation Auditorium, 380/7, Sarana Road, off Bauddhaloka Mawatha, Colombo 07.
An essay competition on the topic "Can Zoos justify their existence in the modern day" for school children will also be launched on this occasion.
All are welcome.

Wheels moves to redress migrant workers' woes
Foreign Employment Minister Talatha Athukorale has drawn attention towards implementing a programme to find solutions to problems encountered by Sri Lankan workers leaving for foreign employment.
The minister has taken this decision after observing the failure on the part of certain foreign employment agencies to perform their responsibilities, said a ministry press release.
The release said the Sri Lanka Foreign Employment Bureau received complaints about employment agencies shirking their responsibilities when the next of kin of Sri Lankans employed abroad come to them with problems encountered by their family members seeking solutions. There have been instances where even accusations are levelled against those seeking solutions for such problems.
The bureau has been asked to pay attention towards errant employment agencies.

World T20 on radar as India face South Africa
Hosts India and South Africa will have one eye on next year's World Twenty20 when they launch a three-match series in the picturesque hill town of Dharamsala on Friday.
Three T20 games on a single tour is a rarity in modern cricket, but both teams will welcome the change with the sixth edition of the World T20 due to be held in India in March-April next year.
South Africa, who will also play five one-day internationals and four Tests on the 10-week tour, are still looking for their first major limited-overs world title despite being top contenders every time.
Mahendra Singh Dhoni's India won the inaugural World T20 in South Africa in 2007 and were runners-up to Sri Lanka in the last edition in Bangladesh in April, 2014 -- having defeated the Proteas in the semi-final.
India may be regarded as the nerve centre of the shortest format due to the popularity of the Indian Premier League, but Dhoni's men have played just three international matches in the shortest format since the World T20 final.
Team director Ravi Shastri said although India's immediate focus was on winning the three-match series, it will also help to identify areas that need improvement.
"The World T20 is still some time away, the important thing now is to win this series," Shastri told AFP. "There is a lot of cricket to be played on this tour, but the T20s will give us a good idea of where we stand."
South Africa's T20 captain Faf du Plessis said the Indian tour will help his players prepare for the mega event.
"I am excited for this tour because its in India, where we are going to play the World T20," du Plessis said.
"Everything that we do as a T20 side is geared towards that World T20 and there is no difference for this series."
Both sides lag behind in the T20 rankings. The Proteas, the number one Test side in the world, are sixth and India, second in one-day cricket, are fourth in the shortest format.
- Steyn rested -
The tourists have rested pace spearheads Dale Steyn and Morne Morkel for the T20 series, but as many as 10 players in the current squad take part in the IPL and will know what to expect.
South Africa go into the opening match recovering from a stunning eight-wicket defeat by an effectively third-string Indian side in a practice T20 match in New Delhi on Tuesday.
Dhoni returns from a three-month break to take charge of the limited-overs teams, his first outing since a shock 2-1 one-day defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in Dhaka in June.
With Test captain Virat Kohli waiting in the wings, Dhoni will be looking to win both the T20 and one-day series to confirm his leadership role in the World T20.
The second T20 international will be played in Cuttack on Monday and the third at Kolkata's Eden Gardens next Thursday.
India squad: Mahendra Singh Dhoni (capt), Ravichandran Ashwin, Stuart Binny, Shikhar Dhawan, Virat Kohli, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Axar Patel, Ajinkya Rahane, Suresh Raina, Ambati Rayudu, Mohit Sharma, Rohit Sharma, Sreenath Aravind, Harbhajan Singh, Amit Mishra.
South Africa sqaud: Faf du Plessis (capt), Kyle Abbott, Hashim Amla, Farhaan Behardien, Quinton de Kock, Marchant de Lange, AB de Villiers, JP Duminy, Imran Tahir, Eddie Leie, David Miller, Chris Morris, Kagiso Rabada, Albie Morkel, Khaya Zondo.

You want it - got it!
When it comes to women's clothing there are two things that they love wearing the most and basically have more of that than any other piece of clothing. The underwear department of a lady's closet is always full. Today's woman is all about being independent, sexy, being fit and being on the go. And when you are that you don't want wardrobe malfunctions troubling your day.
Taking this and many more into consideration, Amante is now a girl's best friend when it comes to buy that perfect bra, brief, lingerie to spice up life and sportswear for those fitness addicts growing in the country.
A visit to their flagship store at Racecourse made me realize there's more to a woman's intimate clothing than just lingerie. The store has unveiled four new collections and they are already making good sales. Achala Hendavitharana, who is one of the many talented designers for Amante explained to T&C about the new collection and what's going hot hot off the counter.
Active Wear
We first took a look at the Active Wear. Now the Active Wear has introduced the Crossover Cami which is like the upgraded version of a Tank Top and suiting to premium lifestyle fitness. This range caters to a lifestyle of active needs coming in neutral colours. Then there are the shorts which come in 3 quarters and extremely new to the collection. There is also the Cross Back Top, 3 Sports bras - Low, Medium and High Impact - and you can match it with the high-waist shorts that help you push in the ugly bulge that we are struggling to get rid of.
The fabric used for them is breathable fabric and are seamless. These fabric allow all the vapour from your body to absorbed and get rid of all that sweaty and icky feeling.
The MAS Intimate in Biyagama is known to be the one best Seamless factory in South Asia. The reviews for the Active Wear have been positive and with Colombo going on a very healthy spree, ladies love to show those results of the workouts in attire best for fit for it.
Swim Wear
The Swim Wear category has truly thought of every woman's need. It's not about just a bikini and a one piece to suit a medium size lady but it caters to those ladies who feel shy about getting into even a one piece. They have introduced a Skirtini (combo of shorts and bikini bottom), Halter one piece, Tummy controller piece and the Twisted Bandeau. As said before this collection caters to every need and every body type. When speaking to the sales ladies about which piece that goes off the shelf here fast - (I expected the twisted bandeau) - they said the Tummy Controller is a fast sale amongst the ladies. With a personalized service given to each customer they have identified what their customers need.
My personal favourite the Twisted Bandeau - truly does come with a twist. The design is made in two colours and the wearer has the choice of mixing the colours or just going with one colour - in just one twist :).
Panty Wear
Panties - well what can I say about them. Ladies do love to keep upgrading that part of the closet very often. And at Amante, the choices are simply remarkable. There are three silouhette that come in Medi, Thong and Hipster. The French Tanga is new addition and really matched up to the classic French tanga. For a very intimate affair a pick from the champagne rose colours and nude colours will help you spice things up a little after dark.
The Hip Hugger has the mesh back with the side seams a little wider than the normal hipster. And there's also a lot of lace work that has gone to all of them. Who would not love a little bit of lace in their favourite clothing
Sleep Wear
So from all those above we finally end the talk with Sleep Wear. Two new colours have been introduced to their collection - Maroon and Dark Orchid. Their Night T-shirts are the hot sellers. The weather we have these days makes you want to get into one of those Tees and just wait in bed the whole day with a good book, movie or hot beverage. The night Tees come with matching shorts and trousers that also have the beauty of a little lace work on the waist area and on the buttons of the Tee. All of them come in Small to Extra large sizes.
Amante was launched in 2007 in India and subsequently was launched in Sri Lanka in 2012. The best part of wearing something from amante is that you feel proud that what's been sewn and reaped here is gone worldwide and making its rounds on ramps of the famous fashion cities of the world. Their designs are made to fit any body type. And one thing woman find hard when it comes to shopping, is finding the right size and amante truly caters to everyone's needs.
In addition to the exciting range of lingerie, the amant boutique offers a collection of exclusive fashion bras and matching briefs in-line with international fashion trends. So to get a more a closer look at these new collections and perhaps to add them to your collection, then head on down to shop GS06, Race Course Mall, Colombo 7.

All Blacks wary of gargantuan Georgian
Georgia may be an unknown quantity for the All Blacks but they are certainly aware of "Gorgodzilla", their uncompromising captain Mamuka Gorgodze.
Richie McCaw said 99 percent of the All Blacks preparation for Friday's Pool C clash at Millennium Stadium in Cardiff has been on getting their own game right. But, the players have let it be known there has been homework on the behemoth Gorgodze.
Liam Messam, kept out of the match by a calf injury, described the Toulon loose forward as a "massive man and a brutal man."
His body bears the scars that come with 12 years of Test rugby in which he has built a reputation as a fearsome warrior, although there have been times his commitment to the cause has proved costly.
He is seventh on the all-time list of players sin-binned in Test matches. When he was yellow-carded in Georgia's pool match against Argentina the score ballooned out from 14-9 to 35-9 as the Pumas scored three converted tries while he cooled his heels on the sideline.
But he was the hero in their opening win against Tonga, scoring from a powerful drive off the back of a ruck to give them a half-time lead on their way to a 17-10 victory.
His contribution was not just his sheer strength but also the way he tirelessly chased down the Tongans to finish with a match-high 24 tackles.
With Gordodze listed to wear the seven jersey on Friday it will put fly-half Dan Carter directly in his sights and he will be looking to McCaw, Read and Jerome Kaino to provide cover. With Carter the only one of the All Blacks' three fly-halves to be injury free the last thing they need is to have him pulverised by Gorgodze. AFP

The commitment and dedication of all is needed for a better future for the children, she said.

Bill Gates, UN say Malaria could be eradicated by 2040
UK: Malaria could be wiped out by 2040, despite the lack of an effective vaccine, previous failed attempts to eradicate the disease and drug resistance problems, the United Nations and Microsoft founder Bill Gates said in a report released on Wednesday.
Gates and Ray Chambers, the UN secretary-general's special envoy for malaria, said getting rid of the parasitic disease could ultimately save 11 million lives and provide USD 2 trillion in economic benefits. In a statement, Gates described eradication as "the only sustainable solution."
His foundation has been one of the major donors to malaria eradication programs.
The report calls for a doubling of the money spent on malaria by 2025 and new ways to control the mosquitoes that spread the disease.
Past attempts to get rid of malaria have failed; the World Health Organization and partners had targeted the end of 2015 for cutting cases to "near zero."
About 500,000 children are killed by malaria every year and it's unknown whether cases are going up or down in the worst-hit countries.
Despite a regulatory approval recommendation for the world's first malaria vaccine, the shot only protects about one third of children. Resistance to many malaria drugs has been detected and more than a third of people at risk have no protective bed nets.
Officials are also still struggling to wipe out guinea worm and polio. Smallpox is the only disease to have been eradicated.
"It's good to be ambitious in global health but this is another ambition that misses a crucial element of delivering on such goals: health systems," said Sophie Harman, a public health expert at Queen Mary University in London.
"Grand and glitzy eradication campaigns overlook the real necessity of financing everyday health systems," she said. - PTI
