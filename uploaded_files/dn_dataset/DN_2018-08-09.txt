Effect of fake news against Saudi
It is a well-known fact that false news and rumours find their way to people faster than real news does. In recent times worldwide concern has risen over false or fake news, which is fabricated because of its potential to shape public opinion.
Saudi Arabia has been at the receiving end of the proliferation of fake news and rumours against it in some mainstream media and social media. It is a well-known fact that Saudi Arabias enemies are behind such moves in order to scuttle the prevailing peace, the booming economy and social reforms.
Ever since Sri Lanka established diplomatic relations with the Kingdom in July 1974, the two countries have maintained excellent relations.
The relationship is significant because Saudi is home to nearly 500,000 Sri Lankans (1 of Lankas migrant workers) and holy land for Muslims. Lankan Muslims regularly come for annual Haj and Umrah pilgrimages.
With Saudi economy booming Lankans can expect more lucrative employment opportunities in the Kingdom. Trade and tourism between the two countries have blossomed. Around 38,000 Saudis visited Sri Lanka in 2017.
The Kingdom has been one of Sri Lankas biggest supporters in the international stage. It has backed Lanka unconditionally at key forums such as the UN, UNHRC and others. Sri Lanka has openly stated support to Saudi Vision 2030 under the wise leadership of Custodian of the two Holy Mosques King Salman and initiated by Crown Prince and Chairman of the Council of Economic and Development Affairs Mohammad bin Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud.
Social economic reforms
Sri Lanka - Saudi Arabia recently signed an agreement on domestic worker recruitment to streamline the process and Saudi investors are showing more interest in the island now. The Kingdom has financed several projects in the island such as construction of a bridge linking Trincomalee with Kinniya, Trincomalee-Batticaloa highway expansion, etc. Even in early 1980s, SR 99.9 million in credit was extended water supply and sewage project, SR 48.1 million for Mahaweli Ganga Development project etc. This support is expected to grow under the able guidance of new Saudi Ambassador to Lanka Abdulnaser H. Al Harthi, a career diplomat with a wide knowledge in foreign affairs.
Numerous fake news are being spread targeting Saudi Arabias efforts for regional and world peace, social economic reforms. To Page 13
Recently fake news producers spread the word crown prince has been killed. Putting an end to such wild rumours the crown prince appeared in public at the opening of the Football World Cup in Moscow.
Another is Israel and its intelligence agency Mossad has close ties with Saudi. The two countries have no official diplomatic relations and Saudi intelligence is fully capable of handling its affairs.
Another is that Saudi supports terrorism. Saudi is working hard to establish regional peace and it too is a victim of terrorism. Saudi is a safe haven to thousands fleeing from conflicts in Yemen, Syria etc. and a supporter of Palestine cause.
Vision 2030
Saudi Arabia is No. 2 among all global country stock market ETFs in 2018, turning in performance near 20 percent. Major reforms are being taken seriously by investors, and they are coming in numbers.
Vision 2030 is Saudi Arabias Vision for the future a blueprint, which expresses the countrys long-term goals and expectations and reflects the countrys strengths and capabilities which is initiated by the Crown Prince.
The vision 2030 is built on three main pillars as stated in the 2030 vision official website. They protect the countrys status as the heart of the Arab and Islamic world, the determination to become a global investment powerhouse and transforming the countrys unique strategic location into a global hub connecting three continents, Asia, Europe and Africa.
The Crown Prince says all this comes from the directive of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al-Saud, who ordered to plan for a future that fulfills Saudi Arabian peoples ambitions and aspirations.

Face facts
A healthy and glowing skin is the best asset for a woman. A persons face is his or her window to the world and it remains the most visible aspect of ones personality. Therefore it does make sense to protect and pamper it. Various forms of facial treatments have been designed to battle the scars of modern living - premature aging, fine lines and wrinkles, acne and blackheads that are a direct result of sun damage and pollution-infested lifestyles. Take a cue from these tips to keep the skin shining and smooth.
Exfoliating your nose
Clean your nose and other problem areas with a facial scrub two to three times per week. Facial scrubs exfoliate skin and remove oils that can cause acne breakouts. Use a creamy exfoliating product if you have dry skin. If you have oily or acne-prone skin, use a scrub that contains salicylic acid.
Extracting blackheads
Dermatologists or specially trained skin care professionals use a special instrument called a round loop extractor to remove the plug causing the blackhead. After a small opening is made in the plug, the doctor or beauty therapist applies pressure with the extractor to remove the clog. This should not be attempted at home and only done by professionals.
Tips to prevent blackheads occurring
Wash regularly
Wash your face when you wake up and before you go to bed to remove oil buildup. Washing more than twice each day can irritate your skin and make your acne worse. Use a gentle cleanser that doesnt make your skin red or irritated. Some acne cleansing products have antibacterial ingredients that kill Propionibacterium acnes bacteria.
Consider washing your hair every day, too, particularly if its oily. Hair oils can contribute to clogged pores. Its also important to wash your face after you eat oily foods such as pizza, because oil from these foods can clog pores.
Use oil-free products
Any product that contains oil can contribute to new blackheads. Choose oil-free or noncomedogenic makeup, lotions, and sunscreens to avoid making your problem worse.
Try an exfoliating product
Exfoliating scrubs and masks remove dead skin cells from your face and can help reduce blackheads. Look for products that dont irritate your skin.

Home remedies to get rid of blackheads
*Baking Soda
Baking soda isnt just for baking, or keeping your refrigerator smelling fresh. The antiseptic quality of it makes it a wonderful product for your skin. It not only works as an exfoliant to scrub away dead skin cells, leaving the skin soft and smooth, its also an incredible contender against those pesky blackheads. And, as baking soda also helps to neutralize the skins pH, it encourages the skin to produce less oil, which means that after regular use, you may be able to say goodbye to those blackheads for good.
Follow these simple directions to use it:
In a glass or ceramic bowl, mix about a tablespoon of baking soda with just a small amount of water to form a paste.
Apply the paste to blackheads and allow it to dry for about 10 minutes.
Rinse with lukewarm water.
Repeat the remedy once or twice a week to remove debris from pores that can cause them to clog, resulting in blackheads.
*Cinnamon
Cinnamon is an anti-bacterial spice that can be used to make an aromatic face mask that offers all sorts of benefits to the skin, including the removal of blackheads. It also helps to eliminate flaky skin as well as acne, and it can be used as a body scrub for a smoother, more glowing complexion.
Follow these simple directions to use it:
Mix one part organic cinnamon with two parts honey to form a paste. Apply a thin layer over blackheads. Leave the paste on for at least 15 minutes. Wash off with your favorite all-natural cleanser, and then follow up with a moisturizer. Use this remedy daily for best results.
* Oatmeal
Oatmeal is more than just a popular hot breakfast cereal. This nutrient-rich grain is safe and effective on a number of skin conditions, including blackheads and sensitive, irritated skin. It works as a gentle natural cleanser and exfoliant, loosening clogged pores that lead to blackheads. It also contains powerful antioxidants and some anti-inflammatory properties too. It soothes irritation, removes dead skin cells, and soaks up excess oil to help clarify the complexion.
Follow these simple directions to use it:
Cook just enough oatmeal per package instructions in order to cover all of your blackheads, being sure to use distilled water that is free of contaminants.
Allow the oatmeal to cool to room temperature before applying to affected areas.
Apply to blackheads, allowing it to sit for 10 to 20 minutes before rinsing with lukewarm water. Apply this remedy at least once per day for maximum results.

The Government has decided to set up 5000 export oriented villages covering each Divisional Secretariat to mark the third anniversary of the Yahapalana Government from August 15.
Social Welfare and Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage, speaking at an awareness programme for entrepreneurs on the Agriculture Sector Modernisation Project and Value Chain Development Programme' held in Colombo yesterday, said the aim of this endeavour was to boost the agro-processing industries, creating jobs and developing Sri Lankas rural economy.
He pointed out that this would assist Sri Lanka to continue increasing its exports and investment in line with the Government targets of doubling exports by 2020. Under this project, entrepreneurs who are capable of increasing agri products exports by introducing new technologies for increasing productivity and quality, would be encouraged by providing finance through a grant scheme provided by the World Bank.
This latest project will promote market access, value addition, improve technology usage and increase linkages between the private sector and farmers.
Commenting on the proposed salary hike for MPs, Minister Gamage said that a salary hike for Parliamentarians is needed for carrying out development activities and to look after the needs of the villagers. Otherwise, the MP should have inherited money or the MP could turn to corruption, he added.

## Title: Hype over hikes

Hype over hikes
A prospective salary increase for all parliamentarians has become an issue that has generated much discussion in recent weeks and is unlikely to increase the popularity of any of the major political parties, even as national elections loom on the horizon.
The catalyst for this controversy was the recent salary increase granted to judicial officers. There has been a tradition of increasing the salaries of parliamentarians whenever the salaries of judicial officers were revised. Hence the expectation of a wage increase for the nations legislators and the resultant debate about it.
The salary revision for judicial officers came about after the Cabinet appointed a committee to inquire into the wages of judges of all categories last year. The committee was headed by Cabinet Secretary Sumith Abeysinghe and included Justice Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanna and Director General of Establishments W. D. Somadasa.
This was after Justice Minister Thalatha Atukorale sought Cabinet approval to create a new salary structure for judicial officers as well as officers attached to the Attorney Generals Department and the Legal Draftsmans Department. In her memorandum to the Cabinet on the subject Minister Atukorale noted that difficulties were being experienced in recruiting and retaining required officers due to the inadequacy of existing salaries and other privileges.
The increases recommended by the committee were substantial. For example, it was recommended that the salary and allowances of a High Court Judge be increased from Rs 168,894 to Rs 304,200 and that of a District Judge be increased from Rs 151,424 to Rs 269,300. Comparable increases were recommended for all other categories of officers.
Economic hardships
The committee however deferred a decision on salary increases to judges of the superior courts- the Supreme Court and the Court of Appeal- to Parliament as the emoluments of the Chief Justice and the Judges of the superior courts have to be determined by Parliament.
Cabinet subsequently approved the salary increases on February 20 this year. This was also to include increases to the salaries of judges of the superior courts, with the changes becoming effective retrospectively from January 1, 2018. This was presented to Parliament in late March this year and was unanimously passed in Parliament without a debate.
The Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella inquired into the possibility of approving the motion and Joint Opposition (JO) MP Bandula Gunawardena said his group was agreeable. No objections were raised from the other opposition groups as well.
Since then, because of the past convention of coupling increases to salaries of judicial officers to that of parliamentarians, there have been expectations of a pay hike for the latter. Previously, the salary of a Member of Parliament has been linked to that of a High Court Judge, the salary of a deputy minister to that of a Judge of the Court of Appeal and a Cabinet ministers salary equated to a Supreme Court Judge.
However, such an increase did not occur automatically. That was because this was only a practice that had been adopted in the past and not a provision that had been legislated for. Also, it was not pushed through with alacrity as all political parties would have been mindful of the economic hardships being imposed on the general public in the form of recent price increases in essential items and a raft of new taxes.
However, the matter had been the subject of discussion in the corridors of power last month. The Leader of the House and Public Enterprise Development Minister Lakshman Kiriella was quoted as saying that there were no objections at a party leaders meeting to the proposed pay hike of parliamentarians in line with the salary scales of judicial officers.
Kiriella said Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, Deputy Chairman of Committees Selvam Adaikkalanathan and party representatives such as Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan, Tamil National Alliance (TNA) parliamentarian M. A. Sumanthiran, Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe, Nimal Siripala de Silva and Mano Ganeshan, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, the JOs parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena and Eelam Peoples Democratic Party leader Douglas Devananda, attended the meeting.
Since then, there have been varied reports about the proposed wage hike for parliamentarians, generating much debate in the media. Most of the feedback has been negative, with the public being critical of such an increase for legislators at a time when they are being asked to pay more taxes, tighten their purse strings and grin and bear it.
The JVP, as a party, has opposed the proposed move to raise salaries of parliamentarians. The government is claiming that the economy is in crisis and selling state property including ports and airports to attract investors. We wonder how the government would raise funds to increase salaries if the economy is in crisis, JVP parliamentarian Sunil Handuneththi inquired. How could salaries of legislators be increased when taxes are being increased on vehicles with smaller engine capacities, he asked.
The response from various sections of the government has not been edifying, however. Speaker Karu Jayasuriya has said that there was no final decision on the proposed salary hike to ministers and parliamentarians. Jayasuriya has referred the matter to Parliament Secretary General Dhammika Dasanayake for his recommendations. A decision as to whether or not salaries should be increased has to be made by the party leaders, Speaker Jayasuriya has said.
If the Speakers comments suggested that no final decision has been taken on the issue, Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera- whose ministry has to find funds for a pay hike, if it materialises- has been categorical in his opposition to it.
Legislators salaries Vs. judicial officers
Minister Samaraweera was questioned about the proposed increase and said that he personally opposed the move. The Minister acknowledged that there has been a convention of linking legislators salaries with those of judicial officers. Regardless of who discusses this, it has to come to the Treasury for approval, Samaraweera pointed out.
President Maithripala Sirisena too has been quite unequivocal in his opposition to the proposed wage increase for parliamentarians. I will not allow a salary increase to parliamentarians even by five cents, he said addressing a meeting in Polonnaruwa, his hometown.
Some parliamentarians have individually expressed their opposition to the move. These include Ajith Mannaperuma from the United National Party (UNP) and the JOs Shehan Semasinghe. However, they have clearly articulated that they were stating their own views and not the official positions of their respective parties.
As a result, speculation continues about the proposed salary increments. This is partly because it has been the practice since 2006 to raise salaries of parliamentarians whenever those of judicial officers are increased. However, another contributing factor to the continuing controversy is the lack of a clear-cut, definitive official government announcement on this issue.
It has been pointed out that the major party in the opposition benches, the JO, which is usually critical of almost every move undertaken by the government, has remained unusually silent on this matter. There have been no media conferences called to denounce the proposed pay hike, in order to score brownie points with the electorate.
At a time when national elections are less than two years away and political parties should be seen to woo the public with measures that would allay their concerns, this is a controversy they could do without. However, this is an issue which may land not only the government in political hot water, it could burn the opposition too.

Impact of Islamic Finance on global financial system
Islamic finance is a financial system that operates according to Islamic legal principles. Just like conventional financial systems, Islamic finance includes banks, capital markets, fund managers, investment firms and insurance companies. However, these entities are governed both by Islamic principles and the rules and regulations that apply to their conventional counterparts.
In many Muslim countries, Islamic banking assets have been growing faster than conventional banking assets. There has also been a surge of interest in Islamic finance from non-Muslim countries such as the UK, France, Luxembourg, Hong Kong and. South Africa. Islamic finance is becoming an integral and inevitable part of the world financial system.
With annual growth of 10-12 per cent over the past 10 years and a projected worth of $3.5 trillion by 2020, the rise of Islamic finance has been undeniable.
Major financial markets are finding solid evidence that Islamic finance has already been mainstreamed within the global financial system including in non-Muslim countries. It promotes risk-sharing and connects the financial sector with the real economy.
Awareness of Islamic banking and finance is rising and there is a universal demand for a fair and just alternative system that is socially responsible and sustainable. Millions of people lost their homes due to the 2008 global financial crisis. Billions were lost in the financial crash of 2010. Many countries in the world are currently facing an unprecedented debt crisis.
Currently, there are over 622 institutions providing Islamic finance worldwide, with 109 such institutions existing in Europe alone. International leading banks such as HSBC, Deutsche Bank, Citi Bank and Barclays started Islamic finance products and have witnessed significant growth in the segment. The International Monetary Fund has called Islamic finance systemically important in Asia and the Middle East, and highlighted the internationalisation of the Sukuk market (the Islamic equivalent of bonds) with issuances being made across the Middle East as well as in countries such as the United Kingdom, Hong Kong and Malaysia.
The World Bank has also recognised the growth of the industry and in 2015 signed a memorandum of understanding with the General Council for Islamic Banks and Financial Institutions in a bid to help foster the development of Islamic finance around the world and expand its use as an effective development tool globally.
The World Bank states: Islamic finance is equity-based, asset-backed, ethical, sustainable, environmentally and socially responsible finance. It promotes risk sharing, connects the financial sector with the real economy and emphasises financial inclusion, and social welfare.
Asian Development Bank (ADB) acknowledges Islamic finance as a key source of investment finance in both advanced and developing countries as well as a means for diversified funding and broadening risk exposure at institutional and macroeconomic level.
Islam allows for a free-market economy where supply and demand are decided in the market, but at the same time, Islam directs the function of the market mechanism by imposing specific laws and ethics that promote social justice. Therefore, social justice is a key concept of the Islamic finance industry.
Islam doesn't allow for a society in which a small number of people enjoy most of the wealth while many people have very little. Economically speaking, social justice is the distribution of wealth in a way that helps correct such an imbalance.
Based on the core concepts of Islamic economics, Islamic finance institutions (IFI) adhere to certain principles that distinguish them from conventional finance.
Prohibiting interest
IFI avoid interest-based transactions. In an interest-based transaction, the owner of the wealth gets return without making any effort and bears no risk. The person receiving the loan, on the other hand, assumes all the risk and bears the responsibility of returning to the lender both the capital and the interest no matter what the outcome of the economic activity. From the Islamic point of view, in an interest-based transaction, the lender ignores the misfortune of the borrower in acquiring wealth, which is unjust in Islam.
Steering clear of uncertainty-based transactions
IFI have to avoid transactions that are uncertain or ambiguous.
When two parties enter a contract and one party lacks complete information: For example, a party purposely withholds some information in order to wield greater control over the transaction.
When both parties lack control over the underlying transaction: For example, two parties enter a contract related to the sale of fish that haven't yet been caught. Both parties lack control over that transaction because outside forces (such as weather or overfishing) may prevent the delivery of all the fish expected per the contract.
Avoiding gambling
In Islamic finance, both the acquisition of wealth by chance (not by effort) and games of chance are prohibited because of one person gains at the expense of loss for many.
Avoiding investment in prohibited (Harmful) industries
Islam prohibits industries that it considers harmful to society and a threat to social responsibility. These industries include alcohol, tobacco, and illegal drugs. By prohibiting certain industries, Islam also prohibits profiting from them in any way. Therefore, an Islamic financial institution can't finance a project or asset that is prohibited.
Some of the typical transaction structures
There are a number of principal techniques that have evolved over the years. It may also be possible for other conventional facilities (for example, guarantee facilities) to be offered, provided they are not isolated but are linked to an underlying Islamic structure characterising the agreement.
Murabaha
The Murabaha contract involves short to medium term financing for working capital requirements and for the purchase of goods/assets. The service provider will inform the customer regarding the cost breakdown and the profit in the sale price.
The transfer of the asset under a Murabaha contract must be immediate (although the price payable by the purchaser is generally deferred). A financial institution would typically acquire an asset from a vendor and immediately sell the asset on to the client with a profit mark up.
Ijara
Ijara involves the act of leasing in which the owner of the asset transfers its use and enjoyment to another person to use for an agreed period and for an agreed rent. The subject of the lease should be valuable, identifiable and quantifiable. As the title to the leased asset remains in the financier or lessor's ownership, the lessor must bear all liabilities arising from its ownership.
Upon the satisfactory payment of the contract, the ownership of the item is transferred to the customer.
Mudaraba
This arrangement involves two parties:
 The managing trustee
 The beneficial owner
The Islamic Financial Institution (IFI) can either put up all the funds itself or undertake responsibility for investing them, or it can provide funds to the customer who then acts as Managing Trustee. The funds provided will usually be those of its investors rather than the IFI, with the IFI acting as trustee for those investors and assuming fiduciary responsibilities. The rewards are split as follows:
 The client retains a fixed percentage of the profits.
 The IFI's reward is a fixed share in the balance of the revenue generated by the investments.
 The remainder goes to the investors.
There is no guarantee that the IFI's investment will be returned or that a profit will be generated.
Sukuk
Along with the typical transaction structures, the sukuk is an important instrument in Islamic finance.
Sukuk is defined as certificates of equal value representing undivided shares in the ownership of:
 Tangible assets, the right to use a property and services.
 The assets of particular projects or special investment activity.
Sukuk are often referred to as Islamic bonds but unlike conventional bonds, sukuk are not debt obligations but represent a beneficial ownership interest in the underlying asset or activities which generate cash flows. Sukuk are financial instruments which sit above a Sharia-compliant underlying structure which generates revenue on behalf of the holder of the instrument.
The Islamic finance industry is constantly evolving and this article only provides an overview of some of the key concepts and principles of Islamic finance and the major developments in the Islamic finance industry over the recent decade. The momentum of the worlds Islamic finance industry backed by impressive statistics and growing popularity, the ambition and drive of its main players continue to make Islamic finance the most exciting story in the world of banking and finance.

Lankas plans for boosting FDI, exports explored in report
Sri Lankas broad-based plans for boosting both foreign direct investment (FDI) and exports are explored in detail in a forthcoming report by the global research and consultancy firm Oxford Business Group (OBG).
Marking OBGs third publication on the country, The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 tracks several developments across the economy including Port City Colombo, the Chinese-backed real estate project, which has been earmarked for a key part in the Asian giants ambitious Belt and Road Initiative.
There will be in-depth analysis of what Sri Lanka can expect to gain from the free trade agreement (FTA) it had signed with Singapore in January 2018, following 18 months of negotiations, which, while not without its critics, is expected to pave the way for future trade agreements.
Other topics examined include the countrys decision to sharpen its focus on IT-related services, including business process outsourcing (BPO), as part of a wider bid to diversify exports.
OBGs report will also consider the challenges Sri Lanka faces in its efforts to address the countrys high levels of debt, which are exacerbated by a relatively low revenue base.
HSBC Sri Lanka has signed a second memorandum of understanding (MoU) with OBG for its forthcoming publication. Under the MoU, the lender will once again help OBG to research and produce the banking chapter and other parts of The Report: Sri Lanka 2018. Mark Prothero, CEO, HSBC Sri Lanka and Maldives, said he looked forward to teaming up with OBG for its 2018 report and highlighting the key developments within the industry and beyond that were helping to shape the countrys changing economic landscape.
Given Sri Lankas ambitious growth agenda, taking advantage of its geographic location to ensure strategic positioning in global value chains, strengthening international trade through various trade agreements and seeking out digital solutions are some of the critical focal points for the country to build on its competitive advantage. HSBC has played a strategic role in the evolution of the Sri Lankan economy for the last 126 years. We recognize that harnessing technological capabilities to take advantage of the evolving digital landscape can be a game changer for the local economy and the banking industry.
OBGs editorial manager in Sri Lanka, Nathan Thadani, welcomed HSBC Sri Lanka on board for its new project, saying he was confident the lenders contribution would bring an added dimension to the 2018 report.
With FDI accounting for just 1% of GDP, Sri Lanka is keen to raise its profile on the global stage and highlight the countrys emerging opportunities to international investors, he said. HSBC Sri Lanka is a key player on the international banking scene, with a presence that covers nearly 90% of global trade flows. Im delighted that both our team and readers will once again benefit from the input of its experts.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 marks the culmination of more than six months of field research by a team of analysts from Oxford Business Group. It will be a vital guide to the many facets of the country, including its macroeconomics, infrastructure, banking and other sectoral developments.
The report also contains contributions from leading representatives, including: President Maithripala Sirisena; Greg Hands, the UKs Minister of State for International Trade; Changyong Rhee, Director, Asia and Pacific Department, IMF; and Qitao Liu, Chairman, China Communications Construction Company.
The Report: Sri Lanka 2018 was produced with the Board of Investment and the Ceylon Chamber of Commerce. Contributions will also be made by First Capital Holdings, PwC Sri Lanka and John Wilson Partners. It will be available in print and online.

Lanka end 11-match losing streak with nail-biting 3-run (D/L) win
PALLEKELE, Wednesday: Sri Lanka ended their 11-match losing streak to South Africa when they pulled off a nail-biting three-run win under the Duckworth and Lewis rain rule in the fourth ODI played under lights at the Pallekele International Stadium yesterday.
In a rain-truncated game reduced to 39 overs Sri Lanka came up with their best batting performance of the series to run up an impressive score of 306 for seven wickets after being invited to bat first.
South Africas run chase was interrupted by bad weather and when they resumed play they were asked to chase a revised target of 191 in 21 overs. They were off to a blazing start with Quinton de Kock (23) and Hashim Amla (40) putting on 34 for the first wicket off three overs. The momentum was maintained by Jean-Paul Duminy and as long as he was at the wicket South Africa fancied their chances. At one stage they looked like walking away with the match when they were 129-3 at the start of the 13th over with Duminy that great finisher going great guns.
But Dasun Shanaka gave Sri Lanka that slight edge when he ran out Duminy for 38 with a direct hit from mid-off to make South Africa 130-5 in 13 overs. There was still the dangerous David Miller to contend with but strangely he was off colour as Sri Lanka kept on chipping away with wickets at the other end.
When the final over began South Africa required eight runs to win but Suranga Lakmal bowling the crucial over took the vital wicket of Miller who was bowled off an inside edge as he attempted to hit across the line for 21 and suddenly South Africa were nine down for 183.
The task proved too big for the last pair Junior Dala and Lungi Ngidi who could manage only four between them as Lakmal bowled a tight and tidy over to end the match to give their captain Mathews a memorable 200th ODI appearance. South Africa finished on 187-9.
Sri Lanka were given a solid platform by openers Niroshan Dickwella (34) and Upul Tharanga (36) who put on 61 off 69 balls.
Following their dismissals the tempo was maintained by Kusal Perera who raced to an aggressive half century (51) off 32 balls with the aid of six fours and two sixes. Perera figured in a 59-run stand with his Mathews who made 22.
However the best part of the Lankan batting came from two of the biggest hitters in the game Thisara Perera and Dasun Shanaka who clobbered the South African bowlers to all parts of the ground as they raised 109 off 67 balls to erase the previous record for the series of 101 between Boeta Dippenaar and Mark Boucher at Tangier, Morocco in 2002.
Shanaka in particular was severe on the bowlers who in the absence of their key strike bowler Kagiso Rabada (who was rested for this game) were made to look pretty ordinary. Junior Dala who took Rabadas place in the team went for 64 runs off his 8 overs without taking a wicket on his ODI debut and Lungi Ngidi was hit for 65 runs although he took two wickets.
A Dilscoop for four off Dala took Shanaka past his previous highest score of 42 and after hitting the bowler for four off a wide full toss he reached his maiden ODI half-century in style off 30 balls with a six over midwicket. He was out in the final over for 65 having thumped five sixes and four fours in his 34-ball cameo. He deservedly won the Man of the Match
Thisara Perera completed his ninth ODI fifty and was unbeaten on 51 scored off 45 balls with two sixes and three fours when the innings ended.
The Lankan batting was a complete contrast to how they had performed in the first three ODIs. There was intent in their approach and as they found out for themselves the South African bowling was not at all effective as they had made it out to be in the previous matches. Perhaps Rabada made the difference because without him South Africa failed to achieve those early breakthroughs which had limited the Lankan batting in the early matches.
South Africa made three changes with Maharaj, Hienrich Klaasen and Junior Dala (making his ODI debut) replacing Rabada, Shamsi and injured captain Du Plessis. Sri Lanka affected one change with Dasun Shanaka replacing Prabath Jayasuriya.

Let's innovate!
The ideas that will shape the future arent just coming from high-tech labs and research centers. Creative young minds are dreaming up innovations for a better tomorrow as part of the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition. The event which was held for the 10th time ran from July 9 to 13 in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. It is organized by Malaysia Young Scientist Organisation (MYSO) with the vision of creating an atmosphere of research mindedness in elementary and secondary school levels.
Around 30 countries took part in the event in which Nalanda College, Colombo, clinched four medals: a silver and three bronze. Maneesha Pramuditha Rajapaksa lead the team which comprised Senith Nimnaka Rajapaksha, Ayodya Panchal de Silva, Tharindu Deepaloka Munasinghe, and Dinera Susiriwardhena competed in the Environmental Science, Life Science and Physics and Engineering categories.
All these students are from the schools Research Forum which is mentored by Upeksha Abeysekera. Nalanda College Principal Thilak Waththuhewa too supported the project.
Maneesha, Senith and Ayodya had developed a device to separate chemicals from drinking water and purifying it. This system is capable of separating Trichloromethane or Chlorofoam by using solar power. It is also easy on the purse and can be placed on a household water tank. It can even be utilized to purify a small quantity of water. Users are able to drink pure water which is not contaminated with germs by using this system.
These chemicals are known to cause cancer. Though we cannot find the answer to how exactly cancers occur, the least we can do is protect ourselves from one of its causes by drinking purified water, Maneesha said adding that they had won a silver medal in the Environmental Science category at the event.
The team had taken three months to do the project. Speaking about the most challenging moment of the project Ayodya said that finding a sample testing machine has been difficult. They had to sacrifice a lot of time to find the equipment needed for the project.
Tharindu too competed in the Environmental Science category at the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition. He has focused on a contemporary issue involving the preservation of the environment today. He has developed a barrel to address the polythene menace in the country.
If you try to destroy polythene by burning it outdoors, it contributes to air pollution. The barrel is designed to keep the fumes in so that you can burn more than one kilogram of household polythene without releasing the smoke in to the air, explained the youth.
Tharindu had sought aid from Sri Lanka Science Society to develop his concept. He noted that there is no reduction of polythene use despite it being a much talked about topic in the past few months.
The fume which comes out of burning polythene is filtered by active carbon in my product. Thus the output is clean air, he said adding that he hopes to develop the device further and build a product which is the answer to the polythene issue of the country.
Senith has taken a totally different route to Tharindu in his project. He has focused on saving lives when a vehicle tumbles into a pond or river.
There was no way a party in trouble can send a SOS. My device enables the victims to contact life saving authorities. This new safety system enables passengers to open the doors and shutters of the vehicle automatically, thereby sending the message alerting the relevant parties, Senith said.
Tharindu with his barrel
He has presented his project in the Physics and Engineering category and had clinched a bronze medal for his work. Dineru together with Akila Dulsara and Januka Dharmarathne of year 10 have built a machine through which one can get maximum benefits by scraping coconuts. They have been motivated to develop this device because of the high price of coconuts today. Their research had unearthed that if a coconut is blended at a low speed for a longer time, one can obtain better coconut milk which is full of protein and low in fat.
We focused on the topic in two angles: how one can extract the best quality coconut milk by blending with hands and by using a blender. We did research on aspects like the water temperature, speed, and the levels of fat and protein, Dineru elaborated some of the key points in his project which competed in the Life Science category at of the International Young Scientists Innovation Exhibition.
The boys marked their success at a time when the Sri Lankan Embassy in Malaysia marked its 60th anniversary.
Speaking to Daily News TnC the teacher in charge of the Nalanda Research Forum Upeksha Abeysekara noted that the forum had been incepted in 2011 with the aim of enhancing the creativity and research skills of the students. Each year boys from year nine onwards join the team to enhance their knowledge and skills. They have come up with quite a number of unique projects, some which have won international accolades. Once a student comes up with a noteworthy production, they interact with a resource person to develop their project.
The outputs which top national competitions then enter international events.

Mangala expresses regrets to train commuters
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera in a special statement yesterday extended his regrets to the railway commuters, on behalf of the Government, who were highly inconvenienced due to the strike launched by railway workers without any prior notice.
The Minister said during the meeting of the Cabinet of Ministers on August 7, a decision was taken to appoint a Special Commission to carry out salary revisions of all government sector employees, including railway workers.
Following this decision the Finance Ministry has planned to submit a Cabinet Paper in this regard next week.
"In such a backdrop, the railway workers have tried to put the government into difficulty by inconveniencing the passengers. The Government condemns this decision taken by some railway workers," the Minister added.
The minister said that a special bus service had been arranged for both state and private sector workers travelling by train.
The passengers can also use their train ticket or season ticket to travel in Sri Lanka Transport Board buses without paying a fee.
Also, private buses have been allowed to ply on any route in order to help inconvenienced passengers.
The Government has also taken a decision to reimburse the expenses incurred by SLTB buses due to special operations.
The Minister also said the government invites trade unions for urgent talks to solve any existing issues.

The new Marshall range was introduced following research into world trends in the builders sector where in most developed countries the usage of brass hinges and latches is fading out and is being replaced by aluminium, high quality steel and stainless steel products.
The key figures promoting this joint venture are J.D. Peiris of Lanka Aluminium Industries PLC Group and S. Madanayake of ACL Cables PLC who have a wealth of knowledge and experience in the builders market and construction sector.
Prior to the introduction of this range to the mass and upper middle class construction sector, the affordable builders market segment in Sri Lanka had very little choice in terms of selecting suitable products for their requirements. Their very few choices included low quality brass products, steel items prone to rust especially in coastal areas.

Minister accuses doctors of poster campaigning
Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne accused the doctors of poster campaigning.
He said that Professor Colvin Gunaratne resigned from his post as he was unable to make necessary amendments to the SLMA Act and insisted that it needs amendments.
The role of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) is to safeguard the lives and rights of the people and not always focus on their petty motives, he said. The Minister alleged that the mistakes nade by doctors are concealed and not allowed to be prosecuted and added that GMOA never takes proper disciplinary action against the doctors found guilty.
In foreign countries, the Medical Council is comprised of persons from different fields. It is only here that some people are holding up to it and not letting any proper initiative to be taken. There are no Medical Council elections like in our country. Many aspects have to be improved, he said. The Minister questioned that when was the last time that this association took action against a doctor who committed a medical mistake. He further said that public do not make complaints to the association anymore as they have lost faith.

Muthuvel Karunanidhi, Architect of modern Tamil Nadu
Karunanidhi dead: The DMK chief's life in politics kept the Dravidian movement alive, but it was also marked by the multiple allegations of corruption against him and the various offshoots of his family tree.
Tamil Nadu was witnessing a movement of monumental potential in the 1920s and 30s. Social activist E V Ramaswamy, popularly known as Periyar, was actively urging the backward castes to rise up in unison and fight against the caste-system and the oppressive methods of the Brahmins. During this period, in 1924, political leader Muhuvel Karunanidhi was born in a small village called Thirukkuvalai situated some 300 kilometres south of Chennai. He was born into a poor family belonging to the temple-dependent Isai Vellalar caste, who are believed to be part of the Shudra strata in the hierarchical structure of Hindu society.
Growing up in the caste-ridden society of Tamil Nadu in the early decades of 20th Century, Karunanidhi was quick to learn the lessons of the crippling conditions that resulted from being born in a low caste. At the tender age of 14, he was already part of Periyars self-respect movement, urging the Dravidian community to actively stand up in opposition to the hegemony of the North and that of the Brahmins in the South.
Today, Karunanidhis childhood village swells in pride over the mention of the name that went on to dominate Tamil Nadus politics in the years to come. Despite facing severe opposition from within the party he went on to join, the number of splits that took place within the party while he was chief and despite all the allegations of corruption, there would be few who would not remark upon the exceptional impact that Karunanidhi made to politics in the South.
The political filmmaker
Before politics though, it is script writing that Karunanidhi first made a name in. After failing in his Class X exams, he moved to Coimbatore to make a living writing scripts for professional theatre groups. However, his style of oratory was quick to impress Periyar who appointed him the editor of the magazine of Dravidar Kazhagam, the party founded by him.
When the Dravidar Kazhagam split into two post-independence, Karunanidhi jointed the splinter group headed by C.N. Annadurai and helped launch the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK). By the 1950s, Karunanidhi had become a celebrated script writer and had moved from theatre to films. Politics in Tamil Nadu has for decades shared an intimate relationship with films, even before the DMK was formed. However, it was the DMK that took films seriously as a vehicle of political mobilisation. The DMKs involvement in the Tamil film industry is rooted in the Dravidian Movement for non-Brahmin uplift in South India, writes political scientist Robert L. Hardgrave in his article Politics and film in Tamil Nadu: The stars and the DMK.
It was through film writers that the DMK made its initial impact. Its founder, Annadurai wrote a number of dramas and films with the aim of bringing about social reform. Karunanidhi followed in his footsteps. In 1952, his film Parasakthi was both well hugely applauded by the audience and critically acclaimed. My idea was to introduce the ideas and policies of social reform and justice in the films and bring up the status of Tamil language as they were called for in DMK policies, Karunanidhi is noted to have said in an interview in February 1970. Hardrave writes that the politics of Annadurai and Karunanidhi ushered in a new era in Tamil films.
Karunanidhi, the political challenger
In the 1950s, the Congress still had a stronghold over the Tamil Nadu electorate. However, in the matter of a decade things had changed drastically due to the intense agitations that shook the state in opposition to the imposition of Hindi. In 1967, the DMK became the first non-Congress party to win state elections and the party never managed to return back in power there. The DMK came to power with Annadurai as its chief minister and Karunanidhi became the minister of public works. By now though, the party had reached the conclusion that Dravidian ideology alone could not lead a party to victory and money power was a necessity.
By the late 60s though, frictions within the party were all apparent. When Annadurai passed away in 1969, Karunanidhi managed to climb up the political ladder, surpassing all internal opposition to become the chief of the DMK and also took up the chief ministerial post that was left vacant by the former. Karunanidhi went on to become chief minister of the Tamil Nadu four more times, adding up to almost 20 years in power.
In the early 1970s though the party would undergo another major split when the legendary actor M.G. Ramachandran, left the party on account of being denied a Cabinet post among other grievances. Karunanidhi clearly miscalculated the gravity of the situation when he responded by stating without sacrifice and a party structure, he will achieve nothing. He would soon regret the statement when MGR with all his massive fan following would form his own party, the AIADMK.
In the first election contested by the AIADMK, the party made a sweeping victory leaving the DMK feeling crushed. They went on to remain in power till the time MGR was alive. It was only after the death of MGR and the split within the party that Karunanidhi managed to spring back to power. The next few years and decades were marked by Karunanidhi and MGRs successor Jayalalithaa alternating in power in Tamil Nadu and the fierce, almost dirty opposition that existed between the two Dravidian blocs. Karunanidhis life in politics post the 1970s kept the Dravidian movement alive, but it was also marked by the multiple allegations of corruption against him and the various offshoots of his family tree. Soon after MGR broke away from the DMK, he and several members from among his camp submitted several memoranda to the central government citing corruption charges against DMK members. It was only after the promulgation of the Emergency in 1976 that the DMK government was dissolved on charges of corruption.
In 2001, the Sakaria commission indicted Karunanidhi for corruption in allotting tenders for the Veeranam project. The commission had been set up way back in the 1970s after his government had been dissolved and came out with several volumes of reports that charged DMK members of corruption and misuse of power. In 2010, the party also faced allegations regarding the 2G spectrum case when his party was sharing power with the UPA at the centre.
However, in the latter half of his political career the real significance of the DMK monarch in the state lay in the way in which he ensured that Tamil Nadu always had a say in national politics. This was particularly the case since 1996 when he joined the United Front government first led by H. D. Deve Gowda and later by I K Gujral. In April 1999, his party supported the Atal Behari Vajpayee government at a no confidence motion. Though the BJP lost out on the vote, a solid alliance was formed between them and the DMK. The two contested the 1999 general elections together and emerged victorious. Consequently Karunanidhi managed to grab portfolios like petroleum, road, transport and commerce for his party. Soon after though, he withdrew support from the BJP in 2003 and contested the 2004 and 2009 general elections along with Congress in Tamil Nadu. The alliance managed to secure a victory both the times. It was only in 2013 that Karunanidhi withdrew support from the Congress citing the latters insensitivity towards Sri Lankan Tamils.
Since 2011, however, the DMK has been out of power with AIADMK retaining its stronghold over the State Assembly. However, at 94, Karunanidhi continued to exercise the same kind of impact over the political spectrum and society of Tamil Nadu. Despite the multiple allegations against him, no one can take away the legacy he has left behind, be it in terms of the role that cinema and theatre has to play in political and social reform, or in the way a movement by those in the margins of society could result in changing the social fabric of a state. - The Indian Express

New laws to destroy seized drugs needed - Minister
Formulation of new regulations relating to the destruction of drugs seized by law enforcement authorities is needed, Law and Order Minister Ranjith Maddumabandara said.
Addressing a meeting after opening the child-friendly unit building put up by the Rotary Club of Colombo Metropolitan at the Ragama police station he said the police was playing a great role in combatting the narcotic drugs racket than ever before.
As the President and the Prime Minister were both keen on saving the country from narcotics which had become a social menace he as minister in charge had been given the full freedom and leverage to tackle this problem,he said.
Increased raids and seizures have been misinterpreted by detractors to show that the drug menace had increased under the tenure of the present government. But the truth was that raids had increased by leaps and bounds under the present regime. This was in sharp contrast to the situation under the former regime where drug racketeers arrested by police had to be let free on the orders of powers that be, Maddumabandara said.

New-look England try to do without Stokes in 2nd India Test
LONDON, Tuesday: England will be without Ben Stokes while India could make changes too for the second Test at Lords on Thursday.
Stokes played a starring role in Englands 31-run win in the first Test of a five-match series at Edgbaston last week, including taking the wicket of India captain Virat Kohli, who had been anchoring the tourists run-chase.
But Stokes was omitted by England because he is in court this week on a criminal charge of affray.
Fellow pace-bowling all-rounder Chris Woakes has been called up in his place to the England squad, with uncapped Surrey batsman Ollie Pope selected instead of Dawid Malan, dropped after a run of low scores.
But in a dry English summer that has seen pitches more receptive to slow bowling than usual, England could recall off-spinner Moeen Ali, an accomplished batsman, to partner leg-break bowler Adil Rashid even though England captain Joe Root bowls occasional off-breaks.
That England won their 1,000th Test owed much to Popes fellow 20-year-old Surrey rising star Sam Curran.
As well as taking five wickets in his main role as a left-arm swing bowler, Currans sparkling second-innings 63, his maiden Test fifty, enabled England to set India a tricky target of 194.
It proved beyond the tourists, despite Kohli making 51 to follow his first-innings 149 -- the star batsmans maiden Test century on English soil.
Neither side made 300 in the match, England posting 287 before top-ranked India replied with 274 in the first innings.
India struggled against the swinging ball, with England finding it difficult to combat Ravichandran Ashwins off-spin.
In 17 Tests since Root became captain in July 2017, England have managed just nine hundreds between them and, even more concerningly for their fans, have been dismissed for under 300 in their first innings seven times and for under 250 in the second innings nine times.
If they are serious about rising from their current position of fifth in the world Test rankings, it is a problem England must address.
In Pope they have a batsman who has been in superb form for County Championship leaders Surrey so far this season with 684 runs at a huge average of 85.50, including three centuries and a top score of 158 not out.
Root, frustratingly run out for 80 in Englands first innings at Edgbaston, said it was important to put the sides batting struggles into perspective.
I think its sometimes easy to criticise the batting group but I thought the way both seaming groups in particular bowled was outstanding.
TOUGH CHOICE
India too could make a top-order change with the experienced Cheteshwar Pujara waiting in the wings if struggling opener Shikhar Dhawan is omitted.
They also have the option of playing a second-spinner, be it orthodox left-armer Ravindra Jadeja or left-arm wrist-spinner Kuldeep Yadav, with all-rounder Hardik Pandya the man most likely to miss out if either slow bowler is selected.
Its a good choice, a tough one too, Bharat Arun, Indias bowling coach, told reporters at Lords on Tuesday.
We really need to look at any change in strategy, depending on the wicket.
But Arun said Jasprit Bumrah was out of contention, the paceman still sidelined after missing the first Test with the broken thumb he suffered during a Twenty20 international against Ireland in June.
As for India needing more runs from their batsmen, Arun said: If you look at the (Edgbaston) scores, its only Virat Kohli and Joe Root who have been able to contend with the moving ball.
The conditions were trying. The challenge is there for us to adapt even better and we have our plans in place.
But he was wary of playing an extra batsman at Lords.
I would consider that as a conservative move, Arun added.
Everything depends on the conditions -- and if the conditions are not going to be as friendly as in the first Test, it makes more sense to play five bowlers.
Probable teams:
ENGLAND: Alastair Cook, Keaton Jennings, Joe Root (capt), Ollie Pope, Jonny Bairstow (wkt), Jos Buttler, Chris Woakes, Sam Curran, Adil Rashid, Stuart Broad, James Anderson
INDIA: Murali Vijay, Cheteshwar Pujara, KL Rahul, Virat Kohli (capt), Ajinkya Rahane, Dinesh Karthik (wkt), Ravindra Jadeja, Ravichandran Ashwin, Umesh Yadav, Mohammed Shami, Ishant Sharma

Opposition Leader carrying  out his duties - Rajitha
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said that incumbent Opposition Leader R.Sambanthan is the most suitable leader at the moment to assist the country in furthering its reconciliation mandate.
At a time when the country is trying to win the peace by reconciling with the minority communities, Senaratne said comparing the current context to the past, when people like A. Amirthalingam was also an Opposition Leader who represented the minority communities.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at the Cabinet Press conference yesterday about the prevailing controversy over the position of Opposition leader in Parliament, the Minister said the Opposition Leader is carrying out his duties and there is no issues with that.
There is no party called the Joint opposition. If possible ask them to make a statement in Parliament that they no more belong to the Sri Lanka Freedom party. If so, they will lose their MPs positions, Minister Senaratne said.
He said the Joint Opposition first wanted to make issues within the government and when that turned out to be unsuccessful, they are now trying to take up the position of the Opposition Leader.

PM clarifies tax onvehicles below 1000cc
Tax amendments on vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc would not affect Letters of Credit (LC) opened before August 1, 2018, while these new taxes are not applicable for vehicles cleared before January 31, 2019, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday informed Parliament.
He also said that the government hoped to revise these amendments in future, depending on trade and economic behavioral changes.
The trade balance increased from a 17% during the first five months of 2018, was due to the significant rise in vehicle importation, PM Wickremesinghe pointed out. The trade balance increase amounted to US$ 4,914 MN, he said. He made these observations in reply to a question raised y JO MP Bandula Gunawardena.
Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that the expenditure on imported vehicles for personal use have increased by 110% in the first five months of 2018, compared to the first five months of 2017. In 2017, the expenditure had been US$ 316 MN, where as it had risen to US$ 666 MN in 2018, he explained.
Import of vehicles with an engine capacity of less than 1000cc and hybrid vehicles have contributed immensely to the increase of vehicle import expenditure, PM Wickremesinghe further pointed out. The increase in vehicle imports led to a further expansion of Sri Lanka's trade deficit, which has adversely affected the balance of payments, with high pressure on foreign exchange, he added.
The Import Duty on vehicles less than 1000cc was recently increased up to Rs. 1.5 million and hybrid and electric vehicles less than 1000cc up to Rs.1.25 mn. The price of petrol vehicles with an engine capacity less than 1000cc would be increased by Rs. 3,50,000, while electric and hybrid vehicles less than 1000cc engine capacity would be increased by Rs.4,15,000.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe also said that economic sanctions on Iran would affect fuel prices in Sri Lanka, as Sri Lanka purchase Iranian crude oil.
We dont know how the USA economic sanctions on Iran will affect our oil prices. We need to be ready to face any changes. It is difficult to predict how it would affect, but we must be ready to manage any situation, he furthered.

Detection of kidney disease in Rajarata hospitals
Minister asked for special report
Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said he asked for a special report on the opinion of Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital Consultant Nephrologist Dr.Pramil Rajakrishna over the problems in the detection of kidney disease in Rajarata hospitals.
The Minister made this observation in response to a question by JVP MP Dr.Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday. MP Jayatissa directed the Ministers attention to newspaper reports which said the detection of kidney disease had become problematic due to substandard machines in the hospitals in the North Central Province.
The MP citing the report said if the revelation made by the consultant doctor that half of the patients detected with kidney disease are not actually suffering from that illness is true that gives rise to many other concerns.
The minister said what the Consultant had expressed is a new opinion and therefore he requested for a report to know the real situation of the issue.
We will have to check the biomedical equipment. Sometime back, the Provincial Councils were given the authority and money to directly buy the required number of such equipment. We have changed that decision and now the ministry is purchasing them together because we can get the quantity discount. However, I doubt the claim that there are issues on the standards of the machines purchased as all those who sit on Technical Evaluation Committees are consultant doctors and biomedical engineers, the Minister said.

Singer Revenue grows 16% in 1Q
Singer (Sri Lanka) PLC results for the quarter ended June 30, 2018 shows an increase of 16% in revenue amounting to Rs. 15.1 billion, compared to the previous year, in spite of challenging business conditions.
While an improvement in the rural economy was noted in April-May, the company noted a lower consumer demand in urban areas.
The consumer durables industry, where Singer is present is more susceptible to market conditions than other industries.
In the period under review, the profit before tax increased to Rs 640 million while profit for the period increased by 7% to Rs. 450 million. The company anticipates gradual improvements in the business conditions during 2018 with an improved harvest in August/September and will pursue strategies to improve revenue and margins while lowering costs via key business initiatives.
Asoka Pieris, Group CEO said Despite a challenging environment, Singer is continuing to increase market share and market leadership in consumer durables. We are confident that with the new strategies and initiatives in place, combined with synergies of Hayleys Group, the Singer Group can look forward to significant growth.
Group Chairman, Mohan Pandithage said As the major shareholder, Hayleys Group is poised to significantly strengthen Singers growth prospects as the leader in consumer durables and maximize its potential further.

SLMA proposes for committee to discuss Medical Ordinance
The Sri Lanka Medical Association (SLMA) yesterday proposed that a committee comprising all stakeholders be set up to facilitate the consideration and identification of issues pertaining to the Medical Ordinance and propose solutions in a timely manner.
The SLMA is willing to provide a facilitator forum for the function of the proposed committee, the SLMA in a statement said.
The Association, clarifying its position on the current situation pertaining to the Sri Lanka Medical Council, suggested to ensure continuity of the functions of the SLMC to provide academic, professional and ethical leadership to the medical, dental and other healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka.
The full statement:
As the apex professional medical association representing all grades of doctors in both the state and private sector in Sri Lanka, the SLMA is concerned about the current situation in the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC).
We note that the current situation prevalent in the SLMC is not an isolated event or incident but a culmination of a series of events and processes occurring over a period of time. These have had their origins in the interpretation and implementation of the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105).
The SLMA notes the following;
1. The primary purpose and duty of the Medical Ordinance and the Sri Lanka Medical Council established under it is to act and protect the interests of the Sri Lankan public.
2. The Medical Ordinance also regulates the academic, professional and ethical standards of medical practitioners, dentists and other healthcare professionals.
3. The present composition of the SLMC as per the current ordinance consists exclusively of medical practitioners other than one member representing the dental profession. This may have led to a misperception that adequate action is not been taken against medical professionals alleged to have committed offences.
While self-regulation of professionals through regulatory professional bodies is most desirable, such self-regulation should not be in the self-interest of the professionals but should be in the interest of the general public and the healthcare system.
In this context, the SLMA is of the view that the composition of the SLMC needs revision to protect the interest of the Sri Lankan public while preserving professional self-regulation and the efficiency of the healthcare system.
In light of the recent development, the SLMA suggests the following;
a. Ensure continuity of the functions of the SLMC to provide academic, professional and ethical leadership to the medical, dental and other healthcare professionals in Sri Lanka.
b. Review the Medical Ordinance (Chapter 105) to ensure (a) with a specific focus on the composition of the SLMC.
To achieve the above, we propose that a Committee comprising all stakeholders be set up to facilitate the consideration and identification of the issues pertaining to the Medical Ordinance and propose solutions in a timely manner. The SLMA is willing to provide a facilitator forum to the functioning of the proposed Committee.

Snack Smart
Healthy snacks in between main meals help children meet their daily nutritional needs.
Young children have smaller stomachs than adults, so they need to eat every few hours to keep up their energy levels and get the right amount of nutrients. Teens get particularly hungry during periods of fast development and snacks are important.
Snacks based on fruit and vegies, dairy products and whole grains are the healthiest choices.
It is important to limit snacks that are high in sugar or saturated fats  such as chips, cakes and chocolate  which can cause children to put on excess weight. These extra foods should only be offered occasionally.
Ideas to help you snack smart
The simplest way to limit unhealthy snacks is to not buy them. Instead, stock the pantry, fruit bowl and fridge with healthy snacks, and include them in lunchboxes.
Commercial snack foods available in the supermarket have varying nutritional value.
When choosing grain-based snacks, look for the healthier options which are high in fibre and whole grains.
Put a clear limit on the number of less healthy snack foods eaten each week, such as lollies, chocolate, donuts, some fruit bars, cereal bars and muesli bars, potato and corn chips, hot chips and savoury and sweet biscuits.
What makes a healthy snack
Here are some simple ideas for healthy snacks that you can make at home or add to lunchboxes:
* Fruit muffins
*Fresh or dried fruit
* Raisin or fruit toast
* Toasted English muffins, preferably wholemeal or wholegrain
* Rice crackers or corn cakes
* Plain breakfast cereals, such as wheat breakfast biscuits, topped with sliced banana with a drizzle of honey
* Snack-sized tub of yoghurt (plain or fruit flavoured)
* Cubes, slices, shapes or wedges of cheese with wholegrain crackers or crisp bread
* Potatoes topped with cheese and baked in the microwave or oven
* A boiled egg

Sri juniors....great expectations and natural island resources
Traditions and accepted norms apart, Sri Lanka has always been a dependable and most amiable Asian rugby member. All told, a much anticipated high performance status platform, looming larger and within striking distance for our Torrington administration.
Given our 7s stats and ranking...for all our rep teams...men, women, and juniors, the step up fairly sensible and long overdue.
There needs to be fundamental thinking by chief Bonsa and his brains trust about the pace and direction for 7s.
It certainly needs max priority and absolute belief in our natural born talent beyond all doubt.
We need central contracts, insurance and performance clauses to motivate and enhance our current player environment.
So much for my soap box narrative as a fitting intro to this weeks hard yards.
It is vital that sane counsel will guide our competition pathway for 7s Asia wide...better still if we adopt an Asia Pacific touring footprint.
In turn assuring our development teams the best and toughest learning anywhere on planet rugby.
Dispatch rugby ambassadors to the islands...we have friends in Fiji, Tonga, Samoa, Cook Islands, Papua New Guinea, etc who will welcome our teams with much pomp and pure joy....aloha and bula bula Sri Lanka new competitive history and almost genetic 7s transfusion.
I anticipate 3 to 5 years grow and nurture process that will breed the skills and oxygenate our blood.
All hail Augustus for its reputation for change and as Caesar imagined the consequences far reaching and way beyond conventional expectations.
The same future for this Olympic discipline stares Sri Lanka rugby in the proverbial face....its time methinks...and such fantastic possibilities.
Its an adrenaline charged endorphins for all of us who wore the shirt with absolute pride and fierce belief.
In my case ...that runs close to 14 years touring all over the 7s globe with the biggest heart worn safely under our elephant.
As Naveen Heenakan lands his U20 team ...we are all there in spirit and remember the anticipated breathing skills that need a quick system re-set.
Naveen has experienced these conditions and perfect to share that playing intelligence as captain.
Proud moment for H.K. Sisira...his sharp skilled all-rounder Dad.
We toured many years with his steel frame and uncanny pace for the Navy and for Sri Lanka. Wonderful for his parents and good genetics to see the lad graduating the S. Thomas stable with staggering ability.
This is the clean warrior example to be meticulously followed and religiously emulated.
Lets wish our boys solid focus for the entire tournament and more island heart to top both days in the middle.
Hong Kong...Japan...and Korea likely contenders on day 2...the business end for coach Nilufers depth and recycling plan.
Boys certainly ready for the abundance of love to be shared in the middle
The excitement about this units performance is hard to contain...so give the lads our best positives...
Naveen, Ganidu, Gemunu, Lee, Muthalib and squad...
Combination and job to never give up...empty the tank for Sri.
Blessings young proud islanders, expect to hear good things and that we gave it our max at all times.
Bula bula the Sri rugby heart that beats at the Asian U20 championship in Hong Kong this Augustus weekend.
Cheers indeed!

Sri Lankan Leaders mourn Karunanidhis death
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena, his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa and several other political leaders in the country have expressed sorrow at the death of former Tamil Nadu chief minister M Karunanidhi by recalling his contributions to cinema and politics.
The 94-year-old leader, a five-time Chief Minister of Tamil Nadu, breathed his last at Kauvery Hospital in downtown Chennai at 6:10 pm yesterday after waging a grim battle for life for 11 days.
Sri Lankan President Maithripala Sirisena and his predecessor Mahinda Rajapaksa in tweets said they were saddened by the death of the veteran Tamil Nadu leader.
The death of former Tamil Nadu and senior politician Chief Minister M.Karunanidhi, deeply disturbed me. I express my deepest sympathy for everyone, including his family and supporters who have been saddened by the loss of Anna, President Sirisena tweeted.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said that he had spoken with M.K.Stalin over his fathers health.
His contributions to Tamil literature, cinema and politics are unparalleled. I join the millions of people who are mourning. My deepest condolences to the family and people of Tamil Nadu, Mr Rajapaksa tweeted.
Sri Lankas Northern Province Chief Minister C.V.Wigneswaran while paying tributes Mr Karunanidhi said he led several protests for the Sri Lankan Tamil cause.
But he could have further pressured Delhi to prevent the massacre in Mullaivaikkal (the scene of the final battle between the government troops and the LTTE), Mr Wigneswaran said.
During the Rajapaksa presidency, Mr Karunanidhi was not seen in favourable light by Colombo for his pro-LTTE stand. In the 1980s during the LTTEs formative years, Mr Karunanidhi was accused of supporting them by Sri Lankan leaders.
The main Muslim party leader Rauff Hakeem tweeted, His contribution as an artiste and a political ideologue would remain unmatched. This brings an epochal phase in Tamil Nadu political history to a close.

Standing by to  protect human rights
Safeguarding human rights is no more a taboo subject in present-day societies including Sri Lanka. People of all walks of life are teaming up like never before to break the stigma of making the society aware of human rights violations of all sorts.
Everyone in this blue planet has the right to life, liberty and security. Violence, harassment, bullying, exploitation, molestation and abuses of sorts thus should be considered serious violations of human rights.
Abuses such as physical, sexual and psychological harm or threat of violence, coercion or depriving of liberty could happen to anyone in public or private life.
There are lobby groups and human rights activists in the world that actively work on making societies and authorities aware of human rights violations taking place and most importantly on preventing those.
Stand By Me.lk to fore
Stand By Me.lk a nonprofit organization unveiled on June 30, 2018 at the Good Market at Racecourse endeavours on setting up an environment free of any type of abuse, which violates peoples right to live freely in this world. The entity comprises with four co-founders namely, Tassy Dahlan, Dalendra de Silva, Elma Iqbaal and Imran Rajabdeen.
Tassy Dahlan said Stand By Me.lk intend spreading awareness mainly in primary schools to educate the youth, and in offices and transport sector, where harassment issues are paramount and need to be addressed.
We hope to set up an environment free of any types of abuse, which violates peoples right to live freely in this world. We strive to build a better environment for this society free of any types of violation, doing our best to help people to be seen and treated as people, rather than objects. Our movement uses nothing but research and personal accounts to bring this issue out into the open and get people talk about something that has previously been considered taboo, she said.
In addition to creating awareness, Stand By Me.lk also assists and educates victims of gender based violence and help them to make an informed decision, while offering them a place to turn for help, as so many are silently struggling and are too ashamed or embarrassed to reach out for help.
Because of the stigma, many women harassed in busses or in workplaces wont resist to these injustices. The trauma of being a silent victim is so damaging, said Stand By Me.lk co-founder Imran Rajabdeen.
Stand By Me co-founders, Tassy Dahlan and Imran Rajabdeen (in the middle) at the launch
For any subject there are doers and talkers. Initially our chat group aroused interest of the public towards this subject of public harassment. We were total strangers connected via social media at the time, he said.
When a girl who has been harassed in a bus went public via a social media chat group which had around 20,000 members, it caught our attention. With the initiation of Dalendra we formed a WhatsApp group to address this issue and kept on adding members to the group. Eventually this led us to meet as a team and form Stand By Me.lk, he added.
Stand By Me cofounder Elma Iqbaal said, People who are harassed in a society are not always women. However the majority of victims comprise women. A woman is a mother. She could be a wife. She is a sister. She is a girl friend. She is the one who could give birth to an offspring. Thus any society should adhere to the moral values of respecting women. When women are respected, a society brightens up and evolves for its betterment.
Assisting an imprisoned lady
Stand By Me provides prompt procedures for investigations of harassments or any form of violation of dignity and consent claims. One of the matters they currently involved in is trying to remove from remand prison, a lady who needs to have a mental health evaluation.
Apparently rather than being in the prison, she ought to be in a mental institution like Angoda for treatment, but the authorities are yet to act in her favour. Attorney at Law (LLB), Gamini Kirindage is appearing for the victim on behalf of Stand By Me.
Stand By Me.lk launch at the Good Market, Racecourse
A Stand By Me.lk delegate has already attended her court hearing and also visited the lady in remand. Stand By Me.lk spreads awareness of harassment, abuse, bullying, exploitation, molestation and violence in line with government policies.
They aim to do this through education, mass communication and by supporting those who suffer from violence as well as those inclined to be violent.
With an all-inclusive approach, the team carries out their message across borders of religious beliefs, political agenda, and social backgrounds by presenting it as a public health issue, rather than as a moral, political or religious argument. Their Face book page link is

Tamil Nadus last icon
Someone who never rested, rests here. So read the Tamil wordings on the casket of Muthuvel Kalaignar Karunanidhi (94), popular politician, poet and scriptwriter of Tamil Nadu. The Southern Indian State has lost the last icon who came to the political stage from the silver screen, along with the legendary M G Ramachandran (MGR) and Jayaram Jayalalithaa, both of whom predeceased him. All three of them did become Chief Minister, a post which Karunanidhi held five times.
Karunanidhi dominated the Tamil-language movie industry as a screenwriter beginning in the 1950s, and later the political scene for nearly five decades. From his school days, Karunanidhi showed an interest in drama, poetry and literature. He began his career as a screenwriter at the age of just 20. His first film, Rajakumaari (1945), which incidentally starred MGR, gained him immense recognition and popularity. Karunanidhi penned screenplays, stories and dialogues for more than 50 Tamil movies including Marudanattu Ilavarasi, Mandiri Kumari, Tirumbipar and Arasilangkumari. Some of his movies were a conduit for his Dravidian ideology, infused with his anti-caste and anti-religious attitudes.
A life in politics was an inevitable trajectory for Karunanidhi, who was well known for his wit and oratorical skills. After joining politics at age 33 and winning a State Legislature seat in 1957, he won 13 State elections. He became the Chief Minister for the first time nearly 50 years ago and held that position five times for a total of 19 years. He led the Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMK) political party founded by his mentor C.N. Annadurai, himself a scriptwriter and Chief Minister and the leading light of the Dravidian Movement in Tamil Nadu. Appropriately, Karunanidhi will be laid to rest next to the Anna Memorial.
Although Karunanidhi and MGR, who later formed the AIADMK, fell out over serious differences in 1972, MGR continued to address Karunanidhi as Andavane (God), which is a measure of the respect the latter commanded in Tamil Nadu political circles. This was somewhat ironic, given that Karunanidhi was known as an atheist. In the words of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, Karunanidhi was a deep-rooted mass leader, prolific thinker, accomplished writer and a stalwart whose life was devoted to the welfare of the poor and the marginalized. It was only two years ago that he gave up active politics as his health deteriorated.
To his legion of supporters, Karunanidhi was Tamil Inaththalaivar or, the leader of the Tamil race which, perhaps unfortunately led him to believe that he should get involved in the conflict in Sri Lankas North. He divided opinion on both sides of the Palk Strait with his apparent support for the Tamil militant movements in Sri Lanka and leadership of the controversial Tamil Eelam Supporters Association in 1986. However, he was seen as being more supportive towards the TELO than the LTTE and was devastated when the LTTE assassinated TELO leaders despite a personal appeal to the LTTE leader. He counted many friends among Sri Lankan politicians, even those from the South. While being supportive of the separatist movements in Sri Lanka, he was careful not to stoke separatist sentiments in his own State, whose populace shares common linguistic and cultural traits with Tamils in Sri Lankas North. He justified his actions saying he primarily stood for a just solution for the Tamils. He was among the Indian politicians who opposed the Indo-Lanka Accord of 1987 and the presence of the Indian Peace Keeping Force (IPKF) in Sri Lanka.
Things turned sour for Karunanidhi and the LTTE in 1991, when the latter was accused of and later found guilty of the assassination of former Prime Minister Rajiv Gandhi. Even though the Karunanidhi tenure which began in 1989 was curtailed in January 1991 due to its apparent encouragement of the LTTE, it was a bit too late as the LTTE had used the prevailing freedom to assemble a team to assassinate Gandhi just four months later. Although Karunanidhi vehemently denied allegations that the Tigers were having a free run during his regime, the public opinion in Tamil Nadu had turned firmly against the terror group by this time. It was no longer fashionable to support the separatist cause in Sri Lanka and Karunanidhi adopted an anti-LTTE attitude.
In his subsequent terms as Chief Minister (1996-2001 and 2006-11), Karunanidhi cracked down on overt expressions of support to the organisation. However, he still advocated a federalist sort of solution to the conflict in Sri Lanka, which found few takers on either side. His last hurrah on this issue was going on a sudden fast one day in April 2009, which was called off a few hours later after the Centre said it had got an assurance from the Sri Lankan Government that major combat operations using heavy weapons were over.
Karunanidhi is survived in the political world by two of his children  his second son, M.K. Stalin, is his chosen political heir while a daughter, Kanimozhi, is a MP the Indian Parliament. This will ensure that his political legacy will not be forgotten for many years to come.

Top tips for a healthy breakfast
Ever scrambled out the door without a chance to sit down and eat Consider this: with a nourishing breakfast, were energised and ready to tackle our day - so here are some ways you can build this first meal and fuel yourself up.
Here are top tips for building a healthy breakfast:
1. Select quality complex carbs
For many, breakfast is often based around a carbohydrate food of some sort - think toast, cereal or porridge. When digested and absorbed carbohydrates break down into sugars in the body, and the rate at which this happens can be determined by the type of carbohydrate, as well as what theyre eaten with. Complex slow-releasing carbs supply us with a steady release of energy (e.g. porridge), while more refined processed options (e.g. sugary cereal), which often contain excess added sugars, are digested and released quickly, and can cause blood sugar crashes and poor energy levels.
2. Dont forget protein
Out of the three macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fat), protein is the slowest to be digested. This means when we include protein-rich foods in our meal, it will help keep us feeling fuller for longer. Protein is also made up of essential amino acids, which serve as the building blocks of our body, and are essential for good health.
3. Nutrients are king
Our health is hugely influenced by the quality of our food. Starting our day with a high quality, nutrient-rich breakfast will nourish us deeply and is a habit that will cumulatively contribute to good health. Whole, unprocessed foods are naturally high in nutrients, and should make up the bulk of our diet.
Here are some more breakfast ideas to get you inspired in the kitchen:
- Smoked salmon and smashed avocado on high quality grainy toast.
- Fresh fruit, nuts, seeds, with a few spoons of coconut yoghurt or full-fat probiotic, unsweetened yoghurt.
- Omelette packed with colourful veggies.
- High quality muesli, with your favourite milk and a piece of fresh sliced fruit.
- Breakfast burrito - filled with scrambled eggs, sauteed veggies and salsa.

WATER TARIFF INCREASE SOON - State Minister
A revision to the water tariff will have to be made shortly, City Planning and Water Supply State Minister Lucky Jayawardena told Parliament yesterday.
He said the National Water Supply and Drainage Board is facing financial difficulties as its expenditure on water purification, distribution, new water supply connections, payments of salaries to employees and debt servicing has increased significantly.
He however said the tariff on the first 15 units of water distributed to low income families (Samurdhi category) will not be increased.
He said the date and amount of water tariff revision are yet to be finalised. He said water tariffs had not been revised since 2015.
The tariff for one unit of water (1,000 litres) now is Rs 5 for domestic users under the Samurdhi category, Rs 8 for domestic estate community and Rs 12 for other domestic consumers.
He noted as at December 31, 2017 the Water Board had an accumulated debt of Rs 178,637 million out of which Rs 54,434 million had been obtained from local banks. He noted the profits of the Board alone are insufficient to service this debt.
In addition the Board is also burdened with price hikes of electricity, chemicals and other materials needed, he noted.
He added the Water Board has recorded a profit of Rs 1,737 million last year. The State Minister was responding to a question raised by UPFA MP Dayasiri Jayasekara.
Jayasekara brought the attention of the state minister towards a foreign funded water project with bloated estimates, in which Rs 2 million each has been estimated to remove 27 trees to facilitate the project.
The State Minister promised to look into the said allegation.

World of  Christopher Robin  feels very real
Actor Ewan McGregor says his upcoming live action film Christopher Robin has a realistic touch to it.
Looking at our sets and the stuff, we have done outdoors on the streets where we have turned the streets of London into 1949 London streets - it looked so real, said McGregor.
I have done lots of period things and the danger with period films is that they can become sort of in your face and you can see the period. But on this film somehow it didnt... It just felt very realistic. And I think it was due to our talented production design and costume design, he added.
Disneys Christopher Robin brings the timeless charm of A.A. Milnes stories and characters to the big screen.
The film narrates the story of a young boy who embarks on a journey full of adventures in the Hundred Acre Wood with his band of spirited and lovable stuffed animals. In the film, he has grown up and lost his way. McGregor will be seen as Christopher Robin in the Marc Forster directorial.
It also features the voices of Jim Cummings, Brad Garrett, Toby Jones, Nick Mohammed, Peter Capaldi and Sophie Okonedo.

Wew Dahasak, Gam Dahasak  project a beacon of hope
The Wew Dahasak, Gam Dahasak project had become a beacon of hope to the farming community. The project aimed at providing an uninterrupted water supply to the farmers, Agriculture Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
He was addressing a gathering of farmers at Agunakolapelessa, recently.
He said old tanks in the district that were filled with mud for a long time, would be dredged and renovated, adding that there were certain tanks in the district and adjoining districts, that had remained dilapidated for decades.
The minister said that as it was the farming community that provided the nation with food, in turn, they should be provided with incentives and subsidies that would boost their livelihoods and work.
Minister Amaraweera said that there were about 27,000 tanks and anicuts in the country, adding that a sum of Rs.3.5 billion would be utilised to renovate them. He said that no other government in the countrys history, had provided farmers with incentives and subsidies as much as the Good Governance Government had.
Infrastructure-development in the said areas would be carried out parallel to the Wew Dahask, Gam Dahasak project as well, the minister added.

To help Sri Lankans live healthier, longer, better lives
AIA Insurance makes new brand promise
AIA Insurance, having undertaken extensive research across Asia to understand how, in todays world, AIA differentiates itself in a relevant and sustainable way, has annouced a new brand promise; helping people live healthier, longer and better lives.
This is with a goal is to help people to make the most of life. Its not just about living life but about living life well- living life to the fullest.
And what does this mean for Sri Lanka asked AIAs CEO Pankaj Banerjee; As an Insurer, AIA wants to step in to make a positive change to the way customers view insurance. We want to change the you die- we pay model of insurance to we are here to help you live life to the fullest, with the people you love. It is better for us as the insurer, it is better for the customer and ultimately, it is better for the community.
Pankaj continued with a rapidly aging population, improving lifespans and more nuclear families the need for personal pensions has never been greater. As a responsible insurer, it is our role to educate people, help them plan and save so that our customers can indeed live life to the fullest in retirement. Another dimension of whats happening in Sri Lanka is that as people get wealthier, they arent necessarily getting healthier! We dont exercise enough, smoke and drink too much alcohol and eat unhealthily! And as were living longer, the chances of us needing medical care only increase. In fact, 75% of deaths are due to non-communicable diseases (NCDs), which are steadily on the rise. Again, this is a key area where AIA is stepping up to support Sri Lankans  were ensuring that they are financially protected for any health eventuality  so that they can afford the best care and bounce back from illness. Better still, were encouraging the overall wellness of Sri Lankans by motivating them to lead healthier lifestyles and rewarding them to do so.
The importance of AIAs mission was further validated by the findings of the annual AIA Healthy Living Index (HLI) survey which highlights prevailing health trends across Asia. The 2018 survey found that Sri Lanka is facing a critical illness finance gap where savings, current levels of insurance and government health provisions may not be enough to pay for the treatment for critical illnesses (such as cancer, heart disease). 41% of respondents expressed their worry about having to financially cope with these serious illnesses.
So how can AIA help asked Deputy CEO Upul Wijesinghe; The cost of medical treatment is increasing. A brief hospitalisation for flu costs about Rs. 100,000, a bypass surgery about Rs. 750,000, a kidney transplant approximately Rs. 1.5 million and the cost of cancer treatment in an infinite amount. With people living an average of 20 years after retiring, how can retirees ensure that they can sustain the lifestyle they are used to along with the inevitable medical bills, when there is no sustainable monthly income 50% of retirees in Sri Lanka depend on their children but we can all agree that thats not the ideal situation.
This is where our products can help he said; AIAs expertise is in health and pensions with options for everyone from all walks of life. Our flagship health product AIA Health Protector has been designed to help our customers focus on getting better and not have to worry about finances. It is currently the most comprehensive health cover available in the market and not only covers 37 critical illnesses, 250+ surgeries, hospital expenses but also allows Sri Lankans to secure the best medical treatment world-wide.
AIA Smart Pensions is another great example of how were ensuring a better life for the many Sri Lankans that trust their retirement savings with us. Packed with features, it is designed to maximise your savings when you are ready to retire. AIA Smart Pensions lets customers replace their monthly pay cheques with monthly pension cheques that then increase each month to fight against inflation. And it guarantees the pension to your beneficiaries even if you arent around.
AIA Vitality is another great example of how we help people live Healthier said AIA Chief Marketing Officer Nikhil Advani; a science backed wellness programme that helps you make a real change to your life by rewarding you for being active. By doing so we hope to motivate people to get active, fit and healthy. Over 30,000 Sri Lankans are enrolled on AIA Vitality and it is immensely popular with corporate employees who AIA signs up through the corporate wellness days it organizes across the country. The programme is free for anyone to join.
Corporate wellness is an important part of what we do because it ensures a healthy workforce which means happier, more productive employees. That is why we proactively conduct corporate wellness days where we engage employees to understand their health and show them how they can use Vitality to improve their health.

## Title: Bellanwila Esala Perahera

Bellanwila Esala Perahera
The celebration of the Esala festival has begun, paving the way for both Buddhists and Hindus to recall the spiritual significance attached to multiple forms of veneration, such as pageants (peraheras) and poojas, in Sri Lanka.
For Buddhists, milestones in the Buddhist calendar necessitate the recollection of these sacred events with devotion and veneration. Some of them are the Great Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha in search of the eternal bliss of truth, conduct of the Buddhas first discourse - Dhammachakka Pavatta Sutta, conception of Prince Siddhartha in Queen Mahamaya Devis womb, the performance of twin miracles (Yamaka Maha Prathiharaya), the preaching of Abhidhamma to the deities in Thavuthisa heaven, the Ordination of the first Sri Lankan into the Maha Sangha at Anuradhapura, the laying of the foundation stone and the enshrinement of relics at Ruwanweli Seya and the great revival of Theravada Buddhist Reformation at Malwathu Viharaya.
More significantly, the Esala Full Moon Poya assumes prominence since it heralds the onset of the rainy retreat of the Bhikkus, popularly called the Vas season, and is held across the country on a grand scale. It is owing to this combination of commemorative events that Buddhists fittingly observe this day ceremonially with the perahera, giving pride of place to the historic Sri Dalada Perahera in Kandy. In fact, legends also speak of how the Sacred Tooth Relic was placed for veneration in Kandy on an Esala Full Moon Day.
Parallel to the great spectacle in the hill country, many leading Buddhist places of worship across the island are in the practice of holding colourful peraheras with pomp and pageantry, including hundreds of dances and caparisoned tuskers and decorated floats. Of them, the Kataragama, Devinuwara, Aluth Nuwara, Bellanwila and Kotte pageants take pride of place as they are held on a grand scale and are crowd-pullers.
The Bellanwila Esala festival began in earnest in 1950 as a form of offering to the Buddha and the deities in response to an unfortunate cattle epidemic that pervaded Bellanwila and its suburbs, claiming the lives of hundreds of farming cattle and driving innocent farming communities and villagers into desperate straits. The late Ven. Bellanwila Sri Somarathana Nayake Thera, the Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya at that time, was much disturbed about what was going on in the area and summoned the people to the temple, where a sacred sapling of the Jaya Sri Maha Bodhiya remains planted for future generations to revere.
This far-sighted Thera conducted minor processions for three days round the temple and made special offerings to the Bodhiya pleading for an immediate end to this tragedy and urging God Vishnu to eradicate the epidemic. Surprisingly, his offerings worked well and the situation dramatically improved. That was the time when the Esala Perahara festival was initiated at Bellanwila, which has now grown to be one of the mammoth Esala spectacles in the country. The late Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera developed the temple premises from its humble beginnings to what it is today and continued this Esala pageant up until his demise in 1984.
The Bellanwila Esala Perahera festival in 2018 is being organised by Ven. Dr Bellanwila Dhammarathana Nayake Thera, Chief Incumbent of the Bellanwila Raja Maha Viharaya and the Chief Sangha Nayake of Singapore, after the untimely demise of Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Anu Nayake Thera in February this year.
The Bellanwila festival in keeping with age-old customs and traditions observed at the Sri Dalada Maligawa and elsewhere, prioritises the veneration of the Buddha with a week-long pirith chanting, through which the entire country and her people are blessed. The festival began after the planting of the symbolic kap on August 1 and the conducting of Dorakada Ashna Anushasana and the Deva Dutha Perahera, which again invoked the blessings of the Triple Gem on all Sri Lankans and people at large.
The four Mal Peraheras (pageants of flowers) that took place in the temple premises this year on four consecutive days symbolised the offerings to the Buddha before the remainder of pageants began. This year, the Pawada Perahera, which is regarded as one of the most sacred, will take place today amid a huge gathering of devotees, in which the relic casket of the Buddha and the replicas of deities will be carried on the head atop pawada (white carpets) spread along the way.
The Ransivili Perahera that takes place around the Bellanwila village, reminding the villagers of ancient practices, will be held tomorrow (10) with dancers and elephants. The finale of the festival, the Randoli Maha Perahera, the highlight with hundreds of dancers, drawn from many corners of the country, is scheduled to proceed along the Dehiwala - Mahargama road, Bellanthara - Pepiliyana road and Vihara Mawatha on Saturday (11), before it wends its way back to the temple premises.
The Chief Incumbent, Ven. Bellanwila Dhammarathana Nayake Thera, dedicated to upholding all traditions and conducting the Esala Perahera on a grand scale, has decided to add several new features to the perahera this year, as a tribute to both the late Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera and late Ven. Prof. Bellanwila Wimalarathana Thera, the latter who did his best to conduct this mammoth festival uninterrupted, after the demise of his great teacher, Ven. Somarathana Nayake Thera.
The final Randoli Maha Perahera, will have many caparisoned elephants and dancing groups and is indeed one of the most spectacular and colourful annual pageants in the country. The whole of the arrangement is lavishly supported by resident Bhikkus - Ven. Boralesgamuwe Pemarathana Thera and Ven. Udugampola Hemarathana Thera and the Esala Perahera committee, the Dayaka Sabha, Kulangana Samithiya, Buddhist youth organisations, the Community Development Foundation, Tharuna Sansadaya, Buddhists across the island and many from the other faiths.
The Bellanwila Esala festival culminates on Sunday (12) with the ancient water-cutting ritual and the Deva Daana (alms) offered both at the Boralesgamuwa and Bellanwila temple premises, before the final Shanthikarma ritual invokes blessings on everyone.

Best vegetables to help you lose weight
Having vegetables ready in your fridge can help you make healthier choices if you need a snack or need to make it another hour or two to the next meal. Plus a container of peeled carrots or celery sticks or cucumber lengths is quick to grab and munch on. For dieters, theyre a dream food. Plus theres new research saying that people who eat large serves of vegetables and fruit experienced increased happiness, life satisfaction, and well-being. Wow. Now thats good news!

TOP 6 vegetables
1. Carrots
Carrots are top of the list among vegetables for losing weight. We just love the crunch and convenience of carrots. Just love them cooked, uncooked or grated in salads. Carrots taste great eaten raw whilst theyre economical and keep well in the fridge.
They are wildly healthy. Just think of all that beta-carotene and fibre! And they make a healthy stick to dip into hummus or tzatziki. Dip into just enough to flavour  you dont need to drown a whole carrot stick. And they dont get stuck in your teeth.
1 medium carrot, 140g 185 kJ/45 Cals
2. Mushrooms
Mushrooms are tasty and versatile and you can put them in almost anything! Throw them in the frypan with chicken or fish and a sprinkle of mixed herbs, or add them to an omelette with tomato and chives. And nothing jazzes up a BBQ faster than a serve of mushrooms and caramelised onions on that chop.
Since they have little flavour of their own, they meld into whatever youre cooking! The best example I know is to substitute half mince with half chopped mushrooms (an equal weight) and shape them into burgers or meatballs. Or into a Bolognaise meat sauce. No-one will notice this as the flavour gets an umami boost and they add texture to the meat without adding many kilojoules. The Mushroom Growers call this blendability and their website gives you heaps of ideas on how to incorporate them.
 cup button mushrooms 60 kJ/15 Cals
3. Cucumber
Cucumber has a lot of water and flesh, and no fat or carbs. It now comes in many different lengths and shapes.
Theres one for any occasion. I use the small cukes sliced lengthwise and into quarters for dips and munch sticks but like the longer ones for salads, and apple cucumbers on sandwiches. Ditto for raw fennel and radishes.
1 short cucumber, 100g 50 kJ/10 Cals
4. Celery
Like cucumber, celery is pretty much all water and supplies hardly any kilojoules, so its great for weight loss. You also get fibre as well. Its another vegetable thats great to eat raw with all that crunch and crispness.
1 length 15cm long, 30g 15 kJ/5 Cals
5. Cauliflower
Cauliflower is set to become THE veg of 2017. And its easy to see why. Its a low-density food, with no fat, plenty of fibre and a great taste. Its a brilliant vegetable when youre trying to lose weight, as its so versatile. It can replace a mound of potato mash or a bowl of rice and so slash the carbs and kilojoules. You can use cauliflower in everything from pizza bases to cauliflower steaks that you pan-fry.
Half a cauli goes a long way so when its in season, why dont you buy up big If youve always disliked it, try cooking it lightly  just enough to take away its toughness and make it tender to bite. Dont overcook it.
 medium cauliflower, 145g 145 kJ/35 Cals
6. Chilli
Fresh or dried, chilli adds a lot of zing to your m1eals which makes a diet dinner suddenly come alive. Research says it can boost your metabolism too so your body burns more for a couple of hours afterwards. How much to eat Theres little guidance in the research but Id guess enough to warm your mouth nicely for 20 minutes after eating. It wont hurt and does a lot of good. If you cant stand chilli, you can do the same with black pepper, horseradish, hot mustard or wasabi  go gently until youre used to these oral irritants.

CA Sri Lanka launches Annual Report Awards Competition
In an effort to crown the best and most brilliant annual reports produced in the country, the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka (CA Sri Lanka) has called for applications for its 54th Annual Report Awards Competition.
The competition will this year revolve around the theme Epitome of Brilliance with the best annual reports scheduled to be honoured at a gala event in December this year. The competition will reward organisations that produce the most cohesive, clear and customized annual reports that better reflects an entitys operations, whilst going beyond their statutory boundaries of reporting, all while promoting transparency, accountability and good governance.
With a history spanning over half a century, the competition, which is recognised as one of the countrys most coveted corporate level competitions has carved an important niche as a platform that has significantly helped organisations from multinationals, to conglomerates, NGOs, NPOs and even SMEs to improve transparency and accountability in financial reporting, while also enhancing Sri Lankas reporting standards in line with best global practices.
Entries for the 54thAnnual Report Awards Competition will close on August 31, 2018. The Institute will accept reports for financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and March 31, 2018.
Addressing a press conference held in Colombo, President of CA Sri Lanka, Jagath Perera said as the national body of accountants in the country, CA Sri Lanka has been at the forefront in ensuring that the Sri Lankan businesses adhere to global requirements. In such a scenario, the Annual Report Awards Competition organised by CA Sri Lanka has built a reputation as an important competition that promotes companies to produce high quality annual reports that are cohesive, clear and go beyond the statutory boundaries of reporting, he said.
Perera said that as Sri Lanka continued to inch towards upper middle income status, the professional community and corporates, have an important role to play in our countrys forward journey, by conscientiously promoting transparency, accountability and good governance which are important cornerstones for any developing economy.
In this journey, producing precise and transparent annual reports in line with the highest global standards should also remain at the top of the agenda of any organisation immaterial of its standing or stature in the business world, as accurate financial reporting also has a long term bearing on both a company and country, Perera added. Chairman of the Annual Report Awards Committee, Heshana Kuruppu explained that the importance of this competition has been highlighted by the consistent growth it has witnessed year after year. He also said that the Institute has taken every necessary effort in updating the marking scheme in terms of the latest accounting standards and other relevant pronouncements, to ensure the relevance of the competition.
Kuruppu said that a meticulously formulated annual report helps develop the capital market in the country, therefore ensuring the availability of information in a clear, complete and concise manner which is vital for all stakeholders including shareholders and potential investors which will allow them to make informed investment decisions.
It is refreshing to see that organisations from blue chip companies to even small time non-profit organisations have continuously demonstrated their commitment towards best practices in annual corporate reporting.
I encourage corporates in Sri Lanka that produce annual reports to take part in this competition and convey to the world that they are a responsible business willing to promote the core areas that is transparency, accountability and good governance, Kuruppu added.

Cabinet to discuss proposal on  Gamperaliya project allowance
Cabinet Spokesman and Health Minister Dr.Rajitha Senaratne said the Cabinet proposal presented by the Prime Minister on additional allowance for MPs for the Gamperaliya project was not rejected and added that it will be taken for discussion next week.
Responding to a question raised by a journalist at the Cabinet Press Conference yesterday, the Minister assured that there was no issues between the President and the Prime Minister on that matter.
The President did not reject the proposal made by the Prime Minister. We are yet to discuss and take a final decision, he said.
Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunathilake said in order to make the Gamperaliya project a success, there was a suggestion to appoint MPs to observe the progress of the project and give them special benefits.
It is not possible for the officials at the Ministry to take full responsibility for it.The Gamperaliya project which focuses on village development is a huge task. Therefore, there was a proposal to appoint MPs as observers to make it more efficient instead of appointing officers separately, he explained.
He further said that Finance Ministry Secretary, Secretary to the Prime Minister and Secretary of the Parliamentary Affairs Minister were also aware of the proposal.
When asked about the proposal to increase the salaries of MPs, Minister Senaratne said the matter was discussed at the Party Leaders Meeting in Parliament, but no final decision was taken.

Gnanasara Thera sentenced to six years RI:
CONTEMPT OF COURT ESTABLISHED
The Court of Appeal yesterday found Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera guilty on all four charges and sentenced to 19-year-rigorous imprisonment, to be served concurrently within 6 years, over his contemptuous behaviour inside the Homagama Magistrates Court on January 25, 2016.
While handing out a 56-page judgement, Court of Appeal President Justice Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne observed that the ingredients of all four charges framed against Gnanasara thera has been proved beyond reasonable doubt. The Court of Appeal ruled that the conduct of the accused before the Magistrate is a contemptuous conduct which calls for punishment in terms of Article 105(3) of the Constitution.
The Court of Appeal finds the presumption made by court at the inception about the innocence of the accused, now stands rebutted beyond reasonable doubt.
Justice Surasena stated that court has held that the accused had made the utterances in court deliberately on his own volition, without any permission either expressed or implied from the Magistrate.
There is overwhelming evidence before this court, which has proved beyond reasonable doubt that the conduct of the accused before the Magistrate had been with the deliberate intention to intimidate the Magistrate in order to obtain an order he had desired. The presence of the accused is not accidental or random but a deliberate and a planned presence calculated to somehow obtain the order desired by him, mainly bail for the suspects, the judgment said.
The accused has not tendered any apology to court either in the Magistrates Court or in this court. Instead he has taken high ground that his actions were well within the law. The legislature had intended to vest the Court of Appeal with wide powers to punish for contempt of other courts and tribunals.
Thus, it is the fervent duty of this court to ensure that all courts and tribunals of this country are free from all forms of intimidation and undue influences to enable their smooth functioning towards administering justice according to the law of the country,Justice Surasena further added.
Four charges had been framed against Gnanasara Thera.The accused, on or about 2016/01/25 at the Magistrate of Homagama without having any lawful connection to, or without being any party to proceedings before that court deliberately and intentionally addressed the court without obtaining any permission thereto, and obstructed the proceedings in court, challenged the authority of court, disrespected the authority of court and conducted himself in a manner prejudicial to the power and authority of court to administer justice and thereby committed offence under Article 105 of the Constitution.
During the inquiry, the accused pleaded not guilty to all charges. According to evidence, the thera had referred to Dileepa Peiris as an impotent State Counsel in abusive language and directed him to sit.
Former Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake had referred this Contempt of Court action to the Court of Appeal since it is vested with powers to inquire into such a complaint.
The Court of Appeal proceeding had listed eight persons, including Homagama Magistrate Ranga Dissanayake, Deputy Solicitor General Dileepa Peiris and counsel Upul Kumarapperuma as witnesses.
At a previous occasion, the Attorney General filed the amended charge sheet comprising four counts alleging that the accused had committed a punishable offence which comes under Article 105 of the Constitution.
On January 25, 2016 Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera began to address Open Court after the court hearing pertaining to the disappearance of journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda was over. The Thera was arrested by police on the charges of contempt of courts, obstructing Court proceedings and intimidating a public servant.
The Homagama Magistrate had sought Appeal Courts jurisdiction to consider whether the alleged offensive behaviour and utterance of Gnanasara Thera inside the Court amounts to Contempt of Court. He further sought Courts jurisdiction to take legal action against Gnanasara Thera if the charges levelled against him amounts to Contempt of Court.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Rohantha Abeysuriya appeared for the Attorney General.
Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva appeared for Gnanasara Thera.
[Gnanasara Thera to file appeal petition]
Lawyers appearing on behalf of Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Atte Gnanasara Thera yesterday informed the Court of Appeal that they will file a leave to appeal petition challenging the judgement.
The leave to appeal petition will be taken up before the Court of Appeal on August 29 in accordance with rule no.22 of the Court of Appeal.
Gnanasara Thera was not present in Court and Court was informed that he was receiving treatment at the Sri Jayawardhanapura Hospital for a kidney ailment.
The Court of Appeal yesterday rejected a request made by Presidents Counsel Manohara de Silva that Gnanasara Thera not be transferred to the Welikada prison, until the decision regarding the appeal is made.
Gnanasara Thera was sentenced to six months rigorous imprisonment after he was found guilty for threatening and intimidating Sandhya Ekneligoda, the wife of missing journalist Prageeth Ekneligoda. (LS)

Crafting  leafy sculptures
The art of making figures and shapes by carving stone, wood or metal was a popular hobby of many people who lived during the ancient era. History reveals that kings and queens loved carved sculptures. They were under the impression that some sculptures of gods and religious leaders brought the beauty and also peace and prosperity to their palaces.
However in present society people make sculptures for commercial purposes, as a hobby or for exhibitions.
Seventy five year old Consy Goonetilleke whom I met at an exhibition in Peradeniya, Kandy has established herself as a sculptor. She displayed various sculptures at the exhibition.
After viewing the sculptures and her paintings anybody could guess that she was a versatile sculptor as well as a painter.
Educated at Holy Cross College, Gampaha and married to Lional Goonetilleke, Consy Goonetilleke who lives in Andiambalama, Negombo creates sculptures and engages in scenery paintings, mural and pottery paintings.
Among them mostly she has the inborn talents of making leafy sculptures. Leafy sculptures are made out of dried teak leaves (Thekka) without using any other outside material.
Goonetilleke plans to display various leafy sculptures at her next exhibition scheduled to be held next month in Colombo.
She wishes to display many items including a Japanese lady, my fair lady, the Holy Spirit, a village damsel, dolls, an infant, a lady picking flowers, a wedding couple, a Kandyan dancer, drummer, animals such as elephants and lions, a woman selling fish.
A pupil of the College of Fine Arts (former Haywood) Goonetilleke is a retired teacher. She proudly said thousands of children studied the art of making sculptures and painting during her teaching career at Presbyterian College, Dehiwala, St. Pauls Girls School, Bambalapitiya, Veyangoda Maha Vidyalaya and Vijaya College, Matale.
In addition to exhibitions in leading hotels in Sri Lanka including at the Hotel Intercontinental, Galadari, Oberoi, Hilton and in Kandy Queens Hotel, Goonetilleke had held exhibitions in foreign countries including in Japan , Korea, Singapore, India and England.

Cricket could look at shot clock to speed up play - MCC World Cricket committee
Cricket could introduce a shot clock to improve the pace of play, says a group of leading figures in the sport.
The MCC World Cricket committee, an independent panel that can propose changes to the sports Laws, said it was concerned at declining over rates.
Test over rates are at their lowest for 11 years and Twenty20 over rates have fallen to their lowest ever level.
A shot clock probably seems a little extreme but the rates have declined, said the panels Ricky Ponting.
The panel suggested measuring the dead time in the game between overs.
At the end of an over, the fielders and the bowler have to be back in position and ready to bowl by a certain time and thats non-negotiable, said former Australia captain Ponting.
He added the shot clock would not be used to enforce a certain amount of time for an over to be bowled because that could be affected by other factors.
Ponting said the panel of former and current players and umpires also discussed different penalties for slow over rates, adding that there was a sense that the current system of fining teams had not necessarily worked, nor been used regularly.
He suggested that a more immediate run penalty administered during the match could be an option.
You would imagine captains would then take huge responsibility in making sure their players are in a position to go. If, through the course of a game or a day, theyre not in position for three or four overs then that could be 20 runs.
Referring to Englands 31-run victory over India in the first Test on Saturday, Ponting added such a penalty could decide the outcome of a match.
The Marylebone Cricket Club (MCCC) is the guardian of the laws and spirit of the game. Its world cricket committee - established in 2006 - is currently chaired by former England captain Mike Gatting and includes former internationals Brendon McCullum and Kumar Sangakkara and New Zealand womens captain Suzie Bates.
BALL-TAMPERING BANS
HAD DESIRED OUTCOME
The panel, which met on Monday and Tuesday at Lords, backed the International Cricket Councils introduction of tougher sanctions for ball-tampering after Australia players were found guilty of using sandpaper to damage the ball during the third Test against South Africa in March.
Ponting, 43, praised Cricket Australia for banning ex-captain Steve Smithand former vice-captain David Warner for a year, with batsman Cameron Bancroft suspended for nine months.
The reason reverse swing has become such a big issue in the past 10 years is that the wickets have got flatter and flatter and bowlers have been trying to find a way to keep themselves in the contest, he added.
So lets look at having a fair playing surface then the problem might start looking after itself.
THE HUNDRED WILL BE RECOGNISABLE FORM OF CRICKET
The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) also presented its new 100-ball competition, The Hundred, which is set to run from 2020 to the committee.
In May, ECB chairman Colin Graves told BBC Sport the new competition was being proposed because young people are just not attracted to cricket, though there has been criticism of the format and no final decision on how it will work.
However, the World Cricket committee said it was reassured that the new competition would still be a recognisable form of cricket and commended ECB for its desire to seek new audiences.
The panel also discussed protection for bowlers, stating incidents such as Nottinghamshire bowler Luke Fletcher being struck in the head by a ball in last years T20 Blast gave serious cause for concern.
The ECB and MCC have been in discussions to launch a design project for manufacturers to develop head protection for bowlers and the committee is supportive of this move, it said in a statement.
Members of the MCC World Cricket Committee comprise: Mike Gatting (Chairman), Ramiz Raja, Sourav Ganguly, Tim May, Vintcent Van der Bijl, John Stephenson, Rod Marsh, Shakib Al Hasan, Brendon McCullum, Kumar Sangakkara, Ricky Ponting, Ian Bishop, Kumar Dharmasena, Suzie Bates. BBC
