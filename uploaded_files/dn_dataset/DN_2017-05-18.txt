Cabinet agreed to bear power generation costs to mitigate present power crisis
Power and Renewable Energy Minister Ranjith Siyambalapitiya yesterday said, the Cabinet has agreed to bear power generation costs to provide uninterrupted power supply.
So steps are being taken to avoid the crisis, he said and added, The government in mitigating the crisis has already spent additional Rs. 27.5 billion over the last four months to provide uninterrupted power.
The government gave this amount to us on the directions of President Maithripala Sirisena, he said.
The moneys have been spent to buy much needed fossil fuel power to meet the countrys electricity demand,  the minister said.
Should the drought continue the extra costs on power generation will soar to a staggering Rs 50 billion, he said.
The Power and Energy Ministry had apprised the government of the situation and the size of the mitigation cost of the crisis in December last year, the minister said.
The interrupted monsoons which have been experienced from 2016 is nobodys fault. It is a disaster which we all have to pull through, stressed Siyambalapitiya.
The government has given Rs 5 billion to the Ceylon Electricity Board.
He categorically stated that they have no intention to increase electricity bills although they face daunting challenges in the domain of electricity power generation.
It is necessary to state this clearly because some people have been asking us of late whether we were going to bring an increase in electricity bills, the minister said.
It is true that we are experiencing difficulties. Moreover, the problems before us are serious with high costs associated with power production, he said.
Prolonged drought and disrupted monsoon activity that has depleted water levels in hydro reservoirs which are now at 28 percent of installed volume, he said.
We are taking steps to minimize the use of electricity in peak hours by introducing various incentives as at present, said Siyambalapitiya.
He said his ministry is encouraging the public to use LED bulbs, which can save about 70 per cent of energy.
The ministry has got the approval of the Cabinet to import 10 million LED bulbs to be distributed among low-income generating families. The cost of the bulb will be deducted from their electricity bill. I promise that their bills will not exceed the usual amounts and they will be paying lesser than what they have been paying, he added.

Governors refusal to accept petition by majority of councillors anti democratic, unethical
UPFA parliamentarian S M Chandrasena yesterday, said that the Joint Opposition still secures the majority in the North Central Provincial Council.
He said that the NCP Governor has refused to accept the affidavits signed by 17 members in the council demanding the removal of incumbent Chief Minister Peshala Jayaratne.
The Governors refusal to accept the petition signed by the majority of councillors is anti democratic and an unethical act, he said.
He was speaking at a press conference in Colombo yesterday.
Chandrasena said the government had launched a massive campaign to bring the Joint Opposition members in the council into their fold. The government is taking every possible effort to buy these members and those who face economic constraints have expressed support to the Chief Minister, he said.
Chandrasena added that two UPFA Councillors had sworn in as provincial ministers against their own conscience.
IF the Governor had accepted the affidavits signed by the majority of members, Joint Opposition members would have been in the Chief Ministers chair now, he said.
He said that any government which was in the practice of postponing elections, became unpopular among the people.

SAITM issue, a ruse to topple government
The protest against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) is not with the aim of abolishing the institution but a ruse to topple the government, SAITM Parents Association President Gemunu Wijeratne said.
Speaking at a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, Wijeratne requested these forces not to use the SAITM issue to satisfy their narrow political desires.
Wijeratne pointed out that solutions for the SAITM medical graduates were only limited to newspaper advertisements and that the responsible parties have not put them into execution.We urge President Maithripala Sirisena to establish an independent body to support the execution of the solutions for provisional registration of SAITM medical graduates, he added.
Wijeratne said local university students education is fully funded by the public who pay taxes to provide them with quality education.
It is their loss to abstain from attending lectures. So, there is no right for the state university students including the Inter University Students Federation to protest to safeguard free education. SAITM students pay for their education. Therefore, there is no threat to free education and it is well safeguarded.
He said it was not equitable and practical to nationalise only the medical education while doctors engage in private practice.
The Higher Education Ministry holds 51% ownership of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).

Women playing more important role in workplace
SAARC Chamber of Women Entrepreneurship Council (SCWEC) outgoing Chairperson Shaista Pervaiz Malik says progress on womens economic and economical representation in South Asia has not matched to the international commitments made by countries despite the fact that women have made crucial strides in formal political institutions such as local governments along with civil society activities.
She made these observations speaking at the Women Leadership Summit 2017, organized by the SAARC Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs Council held in Colombo on Tuesday.
The opportunities for women to become leaders based on merits and importance and the formal systems of leadership in South Asian countries are not conducive towards the equal representation or inclusion of women, Malik said adding that women have led political parties in countries and ministries and have been instrumental in leading social movements over the years.
We have a long road to travel from mitigating conflicts to enhance public and political space for women to encourage women entrepreneurship. The region has a great potential , but the region is suffering. There is so much poverty, hunger, unemployment and injustice. We all need to work together, forget differences, sit together and discuss about the future of our children.
The women in South Asia have demonstrated active participation in political discourse by playing an active role in politics, business and many other areas. The space for womens voice, visibility in political discourse and other activities has widened over the past five decades in South Asia where women have demonstrated a spectrum of heated political roles they can take, she noted.
The global history and international best practices have proved that regional cooperation is instrumental to ensure political stability, economic prosperity, peaceful coexistence and above all, the realization of fundamental human rights which includes the rights of women.
According to Pervaiz ,women are increasingly playing a more important role in the workplace, in other social and political spaces as regions economies undergo rapid transformation. However at local levels, women continue to experience many challenges, disadvantages and marginalizations.
Equal access to the political spectrum and finances is essential for women and men to articulate and shape public policy solutions that ensure that diverse representation of interest in the parliament, government and decision making processes, she said adding that women have made crucial strides in formal political institutions such as local governments along with civil society activities. However the SAARC is the forum to which we look up to grow people and sustainable development in the region. But unfortunately it has not been able to the fulfill aspirations associated with it due to unresolved issues between among member states. However no one can deny the fact that only a strongest SAARC can address the issues , be they political or economic.
According to the latest edition of Global Entrepreneurship Monitor, nearly 126 million women have started or run a new business in 67-70 economies around the world.
Additionally some 98 million have established business creating jobs for themselves and their partners and workers. The number of women owned or operated enterprises are very limited when compared with other regions like the EU , NAFTA, ASEAN. This is the area where SCWEC, women associations and business chambers can help each other.
Speaking at the summit, SAARC Chamber of Commerce and Industry president Surai Vaidya noted that the leaders in the South Asia need to understand the advantage of having a regional bloc that helps achieve economic prosperity.

ARA  VINDA  an example
He was like a powder keg in the pavilion. Then came his turn to walk to the centre. And did not the keg explode! It did so in all his fury hitting bowlers, especially the speed merchants, to whatever corner in the field or over it with sheer brutality.
He was none other than PINNADUWEGE ARAVNDA DE SILVA a cricketing star that shone brightly for over a decade, driving, hooking, cutting and flicking opposing bowlers with disdain as he cut loose with twinkle toed footwork which was a sight to behold.
When he walked to the middle, he exuded confidence and was an inspiration to his partners who all prospered owing to his inspiration and the manner in which he laid into the bowlers treating them as if they were just trundlers with no fear of them.
He began his early schooling at Isipathana before switching on to D.S.Senanayake College where his rich cricketing talent began to bloom and blossom. He had a peculiar stance. Yet his coaches Charles Warnakulasuriya and W.A.N. Silva did not think it necessary and did not rightly attempt to change it because that was how his creator wanted him to bat. Even the great Sir Donald Bradman had a peculiar stance.
Stance not from the book
The stance was not particularly from the book. He was not an example to the youngsters watching him bat. However it did not deter him from rewriting the books even at school to club and then national level with his record breaking feats with the bat which was like a sword in his hand as he took on the bowlers and scattered them with rare world timing and footwork which what batting is all about.
Early in his career he was known to go slap bang at the bowlers attempting to hit the cover out of the ball and most times lost his wicket not being able to keep the ball along the ground, but hitting it up and being caught out.
This style of carefree batting earned him the nickname MAD MAX. But as his career unwound, he began to learn getting in line, foot to the pitch of the ball, head over it and then hitting it to the boundary or over it with great arrogance and pride.
ARAVINDA had a good eye. He had the ability to spot the ball long before other batsmen could do and this ability he put to good use to score his fifties, hundreds and double hundreds. When he was striking spectators who flocked to see him motoring went into raptures. But when he was dismissed cheaply there were oohs and ahhs with his followers cursing the bowler who got his wicket.
Outstanding cricketers
At school two of the most outstanding cricketers were his captain Malik Alles and Hashan Tillekeratne. While ARAVINDA and Hashan hit the top in the game, it was sad the way Alles had his promising career cut short. While at practice Alles was unaware when a ball struck his head and he dropped dead. Frantic efforts to revive him failed and a cricketer who would also have hit the big time was cruelly cut short. He showed promise of being a master with the willow.
No wonder that it is said that death comes like a thief in the night and that in the midst of life we are in death. ARAVINDA and Hashan really missed him and his influence. ARAVINDAs records like good wine needs no bush. It is there for posterity.
ARAVINDA made many big scores at Test level. But the one he cherishes most must be the 267 he made against New Zealand in Wellington in a Test match. He massacred all of the Kiwi bowlers and the one who suffered most was speed ace Danny Morrison.
Morrison was one of the fastest going at that hurling the ball at great speed. The faster he bowled the harder ARAVINDA hit him and the humiliation Morrison suffered would have eased when ARAVINDA was finally dismissed. I was there at the scene of action soaking in the ARAVINDA heroics describing the fireworks for the DAILY NEWS and the SUNDAY OBSERVER.
Fast bowlers to suffer
ARAVINDA had a sweet tooth where fast bowlers were concerned. The men who suffered were Craig McDermott, Mike Whitney, Imran Khan, Wasim Akram, Waqar Younis and Kapil Dev. He knew they would want to bounce him out and he was superbly is position to hit the short ones, mainly over square leg. And they were once bitten twice shy and would not bounce at him.
Then it was ARAVINDA who paved the way for success in 1995/96 World Cup that was co-hosted by Sri Lanka, India and Pakistan. In the preliminary rounds he made 91 against Zimbabwe and then massacred the Kenyan bowlers racing to 145 in 115 deliveries.
In the semi-final against India when things looked bleak with Sri Lanka losing their two explosive openers Sanath Jayasuriya and Romesh Kaluwitharana for just two runs, both to Javagal Srinath at Eden Gardens in Culcutta he steered the floundering batting ship with 66 off 47 balls and saw Sri Lanka make a challenging 252.
India in their chase batted stupidly making 120 for 8 and with all hope gone, frustrated Indian spectators unable to watch this disaster threw bottles on to the outfield and set fire to the stands. With the game unable to proceed Match Referee former West India captain Clive Lloyd had to abandon the game and award Sri Lanka victory by default.
His crowning moment
But his crowning moment was when he master minded the World Cup final victory against Australia in Lahore, Pakistan. He played the stellar all rounders role as he broke the back of the Aussie batting getting rid of captain Mark Taylor, Ricky Ponting in taking 3 for 42 and also pocketing two catches. Then chasing 242 for victory he batted like a champion to score a century  107 and become the first Sri Lankan to do so.
In 1996 he was included in Wisdens five cricketers of the year another rare honour. In 1990 he was chosen one of the five Indian cricketers of the year. After retirement he was made a selector and later chairman. He made his Test debut as an 18 year old against England at the home of cricket - Lords.
There are many other records that are too numerous to mention but suffice to say that he played in 93 Tests scoring 6,361 runs with 20 hundreds and 22 fifties with 267 his highest. He played 308 ODIs scoring 9284 runs with 145 as his highest. He also played for Kent in England and the century he made being the highlight.

Architects Role in Climate Change
Architecture has always played a huge role in climate change. We know that buildings contribute to nearly half of the nations CO2 (carbon dioxide) emissions  which is a huge part of the problem, but the good news is, its a huge part of the solution. When we add the fact that transportation accounts for another third of CO2 emissions, and, together, buildings and transportation account for over 75% of the energy consumed in North America, we realize the impact a well designed, dense, environmentally responsible city can have on our climate.
Architects can lead the climate change movement by designing the greenest, healthiest buildings and environments. The very best in technical advancements needed to produce climate-saving buildings have been put in place over the last few decades  for example, the LEEDTM (Leadership in Energy and Environmental Design) rating system is marked for excellence in green building and used in over 150 countries. And LEEDTM is only one of many systems to track and record sustainability. While new technologies and designs help lower emissions and generate energy, todays sustainability experts were not the first to consider the importance of utilizing renewable resources. Architects have been leaders in environment-friendly building for years  harnessing natural energy and using local resources long before advancements in construction.
Thousands of years ago, ancient civilizations worked with earthly materials to power their buildings and homes. The Persians knew how to make use of natural elements; they were known to engineer windcatchers for natural ventilation. These structures regulated temperatures indoors and allowed lower level rooms to stay cool during hot days, also serving as early refrigerators, keeping food cool. Aboriginal people in North America used their resources carefully; today we see a resurgence of interest in low carbon footprint, sustainable food production and a move away from the consumerism that dominated the 20th century.
While global warming is making more individuals conscious of how over-consumption and inefficient construction practices are hurting our planet, there have been other moments in history that caused people to be more considerate. The pre-Baby Boomer generation might remember needing to stockpile certain materials or avoid using some items altogether in order to save resources during World War II. The economic boom in the 1950s lead to an increase in the amount of garbage being produced due to the growing popularity of single use items. So you can imagine it wasnt long before people began to realize their environmental impact and the role they play through their direct actions. No longer is planetary health seen as someone elses problem.
Todays environmental challenges have brought sustainability to the forefront of our design practices. Many architectural firms are now very concerned with creating the eco-friendliest structures. Learning from our past and present trends can help future architects and designers determine which methods work best for creating sustainable buildings that can both survive and actually help lessen the effects of climate change. Recognizing that the decisions weA make today to create a high quality, dense urban environment, even at the scale of smaller towns and villages, reduces transportation energy needs and CO2. And that investing in architecture, to create those high quality spaces, results in lower energy use, and better investment over the lifecycle of the building, leaving a legacy for our children.

Australian Maritime Safety to help SL in search and rescue capability
The Australian Maritime Safety Authority (AMSA) is implementing a Search and Rescue Capability Partnership Programme (SCPP) in partnership with the Search and Rescue (SAR) agencies of Sri Lanka.
The programme will be funded by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade (DFAT).
A search and rescue system was selected following an open market approach to which a strong field of companies responded. Following a comprehensive evaluation process, the PROSAR system from the company Collecte Localisation Satellites (CLS) was selected.
PROSAR calculates the surface water movement and the leeway behaviour of floating objects related to search and rescue. The model calculates all available major environmental data and it is then capable of generating and displaying a drifted search area based on this information. Different versions of the PROSAR system are used by Petrobras in Brazil, Direction des Affairs Maritimes (SAR) in France and the Romanian Naval Organization.
The system is web based and so can run on any PC or laptop with a browser and internet access. The contract with CLS includes the acquiring and supplying of environmental data, setting up of the system for each partner country, training, implementation and maintenance support for two years.
CLS together with Tess (the local agent) has supplied 50 VMS systems to Sri Lankan fishermen and is successfully tracking these vessels according to EU requirements.
TESS hosted a networking event at Colombo Swimming Club.

Big onion cultivation drops in Matale
Big onion cultivation in the Matale district has decreased by nearly 90 percent this season, District Agriculture Deputy Director Kusum Seneviratne said.
She said preparation of plant nurseries should have been completed by this time. But they had recorded a sharp decrease and only 10 percent nurseries had been completed in comparison to the previous years.
The main reasons for the reduction of big onion cultivation are the dry weather conditions, limited water from the Mahaweli reservoirs and rapid increase in production costs.

Black Flags not hoisted as expected by Opposition: Harsha
Not a single person in the country hoisted a black flag on the arrival of Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Sri Lanka, although some of the Opposition warned the government, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
He made these observations yesterday, at a press conference held at Sirikotha, the Political Headquarters in response to a query made by a media personnel.
He stated that some from the Opposition urged the people to hoist black flags on arrival of the Indian Prime Minister.
But people did not listen to them, the Deputy Minister said. The media were eagerly awaiting for the people to hoist black flags to report. The people did not do so since they have taken the correct stance. The moderate people are guided by President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The government can go to an election and win at any moment.
He also said that the previous government attempted to increase foreign reserves with the money taken as loans. It is ridiculous, the Deputy Minister said. We have to increase the net asset value and not the foreign reserves with the money taken as loans.
He also said that this government had not sold anything but Mahinda Rajapaksa had. He added that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa sold the Army Headquarters in his capacity as the Finance Minister in 2011. He questioned as to what an amount of protests would have be staged had a UNP government done the same.
He also said that the per capita income increased during the previous regime, but the per capita debt increased even faster. He also said that although the SAITM has become an issue today, the previous government set it up.

A boost for trade and development
Sri Lanka has finally regained the much-awaited Generalised Scheme of Preferences (GSP) Plus facility from the European Union (EU). The GSP Plus allows developing countries to pay less or no duties on their exports to the EU. This gives them vital access to EU markets and contributes to their economic growth. Sri Lanka will now be getting preferential access to the EU market from Friday after a lapse of nearly seven years.
Sri Lanka lost the Plus facility in 2010, after an HR investigation by the European Commission. The investigation relied on reports by UN Special Rapporteurs and Representatives, other UN bodies and by human rights NGOs that identified significant shortcomings in Sri Lankas implementation of three UN human rights conventions: the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, the Convention against Torture and the Convention on the Rights of the Child.
The restoration of GSP Plus is a diplomatic and moral victory for the Government which has totally transformed the countrys foreign policy after coming to power in 2015. Forging better relations with the EU and other Western nations was one of the priorities of the National Unity Government. These countries share the same democratic values and ethos of governance and it is in our interest to cultivate better ties with them. They also happen to be our biggest trade and Overseas Development Assistance (ODA) partners.
It was clear at least from the beginning of this year that the EU would grant the facility to Sri Lanka, but the final confirmation came yesterday. (The EU had earlier resumed fish imports from Sri Lanka). The granting of GSP+ is based on the country showing that it is continuing to make progress towards effectively implementing 27 international conventions on human rights, labour conditions, protection of the environment and good governance.
The removal of the GSP Plus facility led to the closure of at least 40 apparel factories and a loss of millions of dollars. There was much chest-beating at the time about not giving up the countrys sovereignty by implementing the EUs human rights requests, but the reality is that every country that seeks GSP Plus has to conform to certain universal human rights and values. These do not violate our sovereignty  on the other hand, they strengthen it. Indeed, no other country that enjoys the GSP Plus has surrendered its sovereignty as far as we know. There will be a stringent, bi-annual monitoring process to make sure that Sri Lanka continues to progress. The first such report is due in January 2018.
This is certainly a significant moment for Sri Lankas export fraternity, for the EU is the countrys biggest export market for apparel and many other goods, responsible for 32 percent of all exports. The EU imported goods worth 2.6 billion euro from Sri Lanka in 2016 alone even without the GSP Plus facility. The apparel and textiles sector accounts for nearly 62 percent of all exports to the EU (2016 figures of European Commission). According to Minister Harin Fernando, this could go up to 4 billion euro with the restoration of GSP Plus which will see the full removal of duties on 66% of tariff lines, covering a wide array of products including textiles and fisheries. The EU itself sees an additional one billion euro worth of business in the next few years. The exporters of garments and textiles, rubber products, small machinery, fisheries, food products and tea stand to gain the most from the improved trade status.
The benefits of GSP Plus extend beyond enhanced exports and revenue. The GSP Plus will help reduce Sri Lankas trade deficit and encourage Sri Lankan companies to diversity their exports due to their increased competitiveness in the EU market. An indirect benefit of GSP Plus is making Sri Lanka a more attractive country for foreign investors which could in turn generate more jobs for local youth.
Both the EU and Sri Lankan authorities hope that this would benefit small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) too. The EU is launching a project worth 8 million euro over five years to help to bring SME products up to EU standards which are very stringent.
Sri Lanka is rapidly developing, which that means that we risk losing certain aid and trade concession programmes. With regard to GSP Plus, Sri Lanka has the chance to benefit from the trade scheme until it achieves upper middle income country status for three consecutive years. Based on current economic trends, that should mean that Sri Lanka will benefit from GSP+ until at least 2021. Five years may seem really short, but Sri Lankan exporters should seize this moment to export products so good that they will be more competitive and in demand even if the duty concessions are removed five years from now. We are not the only pebble on the beach and our competitors, some of whom continued to enjoy GSP Plus while we were cut off, are catching up. Thus export diversification, new markets and quality improvements are essential to stay ahead.

Citizens' Mail
Let us age with grace
Not a day seems to pass without hearing of the passing away of some friend whom we have known for most of our lives. This is nothing new. We have accepted this and learned to live with it.
We cannot drive as we did before because of the heavy traffic now on our roads. We need to use public transport which involves standing in queues. It is also most tiresome. There are many other problems too which we face but biggest of them, for those of us who are single, is finding suitable accommodation. This is where the State can and has a major humanitarian role to play. The government could invite the big foreign and local companies to become partners for instance in the proposed new project where the Bambalapitiya Flats (which are to be demolished) are now located.
A small part of one of the many Towers it is claimed would be built, could be reserved for us. That would give us our security and also provide the fellowship we would need. We Seniors could also in our own humble way contribute to the cost involved. I do hope that President Maithripala Sirisena who could live up to his name and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would help us die happily and above all with gratitude and peace.

## Title: Climate change, natural disasters and societal resilience

Climate change, natural disasters and societal resilience
Faced with a whole range of day-to-day problems, many people today do not pay much attention to bigger issues like climate change. Which, in the long run, is likely to make life on earth even more complex, difficult and unpredictable, unless diverse global and local level efforts to arrest the trend succeed. It is against such a background that some of the global efforts like Climate Change Agreement and SDGs become complementary. On the other hand, effectiveness of global initiatives depends very much on what happens at national and local levels.
Is the present international politico-economic environment conducive for the development of a new global compact on climate change and sustainable development The developments over the last several years do not encourage us to answer the above question in the affirmative. The massive exodus of refugees from North Africa, the Middle East and elsewhere that exerted unprecedented economic and political pressure on Europe did not necessarily produce positive political outcomes in the West in general.
The election of Donald Trump in the United States, Brexit vote in the UK and the rise of right wing political parties in a number of European countries are examples. Neo-liberal globalization that has weakened progressive state policies in many countries contributed to social issues at home and abroad such as rising inequality, weakening of social citizenship, increasing ethno-religious tensions and conflicts.
Rational public policies
Rising public debts in many countries prevented them from investing in critically important social sectors like health, public transport and education, pushing even low income groups towards private solutions to various problems they face. The results are unplanned urbanization, environmental pollution, labour migration, proliferation of unregulated urban settlements, and increasing crime and violence.
Many developing country governments have become fire fighters trying to defuse multiple crisis that crop up in various sectors rather than plan and implement long-term evidence based policies. Sri Lankas most recent tragedy surrounding the massive garbage mountain in Colombo resulting in the death of many people in the vicinity of the dump is a case in point. We are likely to face many such tragedies in the months and years to come, largely because the state continues to fail in regulating public affairs through a process of formulation and implementation of rational public policies.
On the other hand, the responsiveness of the State to diverse challenges societies face depends on a whole range of factors, not just its ideological orientation. The capacity of public institutions to investigate issues and come up with possible remedies or policy responses is critically important. It is in this sense that institution building is an important part of political development in any country. What is important here is not only the establishment of institutions but also their sustenance, renewal and revamping in keeping with the emerging of new challenges. Some of the new challenges we face today are connected with the climate change. Economic policy shifts and proliferation of natural and human induced disasters also give rise to many challenges. In such context, improving social resilience has become a highly significant prerequisite for ensuring the well-being of citizens, in particular more vulnerable segments of the population. This is particularly go with respect to increasing disaster risks generated by extreme weather events due to climate change as well as human induced incidents like the one we witnessed in Colombo in April, 2017.
How can we reduce disaster risks and increase societal resilience One major step that all countries need to take is to adopt evidence based policy making as a key strategy to deal with environmental and climate change related issues. Yet, this is possible only when strong institutions with the necessary resources and capacities exit. The institutions concerned are diverse and include universities, research institutions, regulatory bodies and implementing agencies. As is well known, in many countries there often exist institutions but they do not have the capabilities necessary to perform vital functions. Hence the need for interventions aimed at building their diverse capacities. Since evidence based policy making demands credible data and information, the generation of such data and information becomes critical. In the developing world, this cannot be taken for granted, as, due to various reasons, universities and research institutions do not perform this vital function in a satisfactory manner. One major obstacle is the lack of adequately trained research staff.
The above state of affairs deserves urgent attention. The need of the hour is to strengthen the research capacities of universities and their research staff. While this is essentially a responsibility of the governments, international collaboration can also play a vital role. In the remainder of this article, an attempt is made to provide a brief account of such an initiative, namely an international partnership, named ASCENT, Advancing Skill Creation To Enhance Transformation.
European universities
The above partnership involves 14 countries in Europe and Asia including Sri Lanka. While three universities from Sri Lanka participate in the research network, namely Ruhuna, Moratuwa and Colombo, Neurusan University from Thailand and research Universities in Bangladesh are also partners.
The project is coordinated by researchers based at the Huddersfield University, UK. Several European universities from such countries as Sweden, Lithuvenia and UK are also part of the collaborative network. Among other things, the research network strives toward building research and dissemination capacities of young researchers drawn from Asian universities with the able guidance of well-established academics from most of the participating universities. This objective of the network is expected to be achieved through periodic training workshops and conferences during the project period at different locations. One such training event took place a few months ago at Ruhuna University with the participation of over 60 young researchers including those from the above mentioned three partner universities in Sri Lanka.
It hoped that development of research and dissemination capacities of young researchers through international partnerships like ASCENT would strengthen the local universities in order for them to play an important part in the area of policy and programme development at both institutional and national levels. This is important because we cannot afford to rely on ad hoc policies in an increasingly complex global and local environment, particularly in view of the deepening global environmental crisis characterized by global warming and related consequences as well as more frequent and increasingly more devastating natural and human induced disasters.
It is critically important that countries build effective institutions and possess well trained and highly skilled personnel to manage them. This should in fact be a national priority for government and relevant public and private institutions.

De Silva then asked whether Dr. Weerasinghe make a speech at a party held at the Economic Research Department and said Mahendrans new year wish lacks weight and that his intention is to lose Arjun Mahendran.
Dr. Weerasinghe said he only wanted to get back the reputation that the Central Bank lost because of the doings of Mahendran. De Silva questioned as to how Mahendrans wish relevant to gaining back the reputation of the Central Bank. The witness seemed unable to justify his comments.
Mahendrans legal Counsel Chanaka de Silva also pointed out to the Commission that, Dr. Weerasinghes actions regarding the confidential draft report prepared by the IMF and the World Bank, is questionable.
De Silva pointed out that Dr. Weerasinghe had not even copied the link of his reply email to the IMF and World Bank regarding the draft report to the Central Bank Governor.
De Silvas suggestion that Dr. Weerasinghe has acted with resentment towards former Governor Arjun Mahendran was based on these suggestions.
De Silva pointed out to the Commission that Dr. Weerasinghes testimony also is based on the same resentment.
Dr. Weerasinghe was testifying before the Presidential Commission Inquiring into the Treasury bond issue.

Discord, brewing up
The arena of Sri Lankan politics could be accused of many lapses, but it can never be blamed for being dull and tedious.
This week, even as United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) parliamentarian Geetha Kumarasinghe was battling in the Supreme Court to save her seat, the theatre of conflict shifted to the provinces.
Kumarasinghe was granted temporary relief by the highest court in the land. A three judge bench, by a majority verdict, granted her leave to appeal to challenge the verdict of the Court of Appeal unseating her because of her dual citizenship.
The matter has been fixed for hearing in September and Kumarasinghe will be able to function as a parliamentarian until then. That decision calmed the frayed nerves of the Joint Opposition (JO), at least for the time being, but its leadership was also battling with the government- more specifically with the mainstream Sri Lanka Freedom party (SLFP) - on another front.
Trouble was brewing in two Provincial Councils, in the Central Provincial Council (CPC) and the North Central Provincial Council (NCPC). While events in the CPC were not directly triggered by the government, that was the case in the NCPC, where most of the drama unfolded.
The first salvo was fired when the NCPCs Health Minister K.H. Nandasena was removed from his portfolio. It has been reported that Nandasena attended the JO May Day rally at Galle Face and the SLFP hierarchy was attempting to send a message to the party membership that those who defy the party leadership would be dealt with in a decisive manner.
North Central Province Governor
This dismissal however had a chain reaction. Nandasena was to say that he was not officially informed about being removed from his portfolio but came to know about it from the North Central Province Governors secretary during the swearing in of his replacement, M. Herath Banda.
Shortly afterwards, another Minister in the NCPC, S. M. Ranjith, who is a former Chief Minister and a loyalist of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, announced he would be resigning his portfolios. Ranjith arrived at this decision within a few hours of the removal of Minister Nandasena. A few days later, a fellow Provincial Councillor, Susil Gunaratne, was sworn in as his replacement.
However, in the interim, the NCPC was a hive of political activity. That is because the JO, sensing a political opportunity brought about by these developments, made an attempt to grab control of the NCPC.
Shortly after Nandasena was dismissed and Ranjith resigned, The JO made it known that it would move to nominate a Chief Minister on the basis that its group commanded a majority in the NCPC. The 33-member NCPC has 21 UPFA members. The JO claimed that it had the support of 18 members, which if it did, gave it a clear majority.
The current Chief Minister of the NCPC is Peshala Jayaratne, loyal to the mainstream SLFP. Jayaratne replaced Ranjith as Chief Minister, following the defeat of Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2015.
Acting promptly, the JO group was able to muster 17 affidavits- still a majority of the 33 member Council- calling for the dismissal of Peshala Jayaratne as Chief Minister. The affidavits were submitted to North Central Province Governor P. B. Dissanayake. The Governor however rejected the affidavits and the status quo remains, with Jayaratne continuing as Chief Minister, at least for now.
It is unlikely though, that the JO group within the NCPC will let the matter rest there. Already Anuradhapura district Parliamentarian S.M. Chandrasena- the brother of S. M. Ranjith- has threatened to take the battle to the streets.
The government has resorted to undemocratic measures contrary to the policy of good governance. We are not prepared to let them go ahead in this manner, Chandrasena said and declared that he would mobilise the masses against the current Chief Minister. What is more likely though is a legal battle.
Provincial Council elections
The current strife in the NCPC has longstanding antecedents. The most noteworthy SLFP politician to emerge from the NCPC was Berty Premalal Dissanayake. He was an avowed loyalist of former President Chandrika Kumaratunga. Dissanayake was Chief Minister from 1999 to 2012 and ruled the NCPC with an iron hand, maintaining the SLFPs stranglehold in the region. Prior to Dissanayake assuming office, his wife Jayani Dissanayake was Chief Minister of the NCPC for a few months.
Due to his loyalty to Kumaratunga, on occasion, Berty Premalal Dissanayake was in conflict with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. When Dissanayakes son Duminda Dissanayake took to national politics, he too wasnt offered much encouragement by Rajapaksa.
After the last Provincial Council elections in 2012, Rajapaksa as President appointed S. M. Ranjith as Chief Minister, overlooking Dissanayake, who was also elected to the Council, much to the chagrin of the Dissanayakes.
Berty Premalal Dissanayake passed away in September 2013, but by then Duminda Dissanayake had acquired a reputation of not being popular with the Rajapaksas. At his fathers funeral, Duminda Dissanayake made pointed reference to the fact that his fathers happiest day when he fell ill was when Chandrika Kumaratunga visited him in hospital. Many saw this as a thinly veiled criticism of then President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
When Maithripala Sirisena resigned as Minister of Health in the Rajapaksa Cabinet and announced his candidature for the 2015 presidential election, Duminda Dissanayake was one of a handful of parliamentarians who defected with him. For his anti-Rajapaksa stance, Dissanayake has been rewarded with the powerful post of General Secretary of the SLFP, at the relatively young age of 38.
Thus the tussle that is being played out in the NCPC is, in a sense a battle between the pro-Rajapaksa and the anti-Rajapaksa factions of the SLFP, fighting by proxies. Sadly for the party, it is eroding its popularity and credibility in the region.
A similar battle looms in the Central Provincial Council (CPC), though it hasnt erupted into open conflict as yet. Following the dismissal of SLFP senior Janaka Bandara Tennekoon as organiser for Dambulla, his son Pramitha Bandara Tennekoon resigned as a Minister of the Central Provincial Council. It is understood that the JO is exploring a NCPC-style move in the CPC as well.
The JO hopes that its bids to capture control of the NCPC and CPC, if successful, will pave the way for a return to power. It believes that trends in the provincial councils could be translated into victories at national elections.
They must be encouraged from Chandrika Kumaratunga being elected Chief Minister of the Western Provincial Council in 1993 and winning the general elections a year later. JO stalwarts also point to Harin Fernando who, although losing the Uva Provincial Council elections in 2014, enlisted the support of some UPFA councillors to oust Shashendra Rajapaksa and become Chief Minister.
Political parties
That move provided the United National Party (UNP), which was floundering until then, with much needed momentum and set the stage for the partys successful presidential and general election campaigns in 2015.
The final arbiters of the popularity of political parties are the voters who will indeed have a chance to express their views because provincial council elections are due. Those polls will set the tone for national elections and will be eagerly awaited, also because it will shed light on how much support the two warring factions of the SLFP command.
If however, the SLFP continues to be its own worst enemy and engage in tussles within the party, as it is doing now in the NCPC and the CPC, there can be only one winner: the UNP. The next provincial council elections, when they are held, may well see a phenomenon that has not been seen before: a three way tussle for supremacy between the UNP, the SLFP and the JO which may foretell which way the winds of political good fortune are blowing, two years after the last major elections and three years before the next major polls.

Fundamental Rights petition challenging COPE report re-fixed for support

The Fundamental Rights petition filed by Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thero challenging the various findings and statements made in a report prepared by the Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) regarding the bond issues of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka in the year of 2015 and 2016 was re-fixed for support on September 8 by Supreme Court today.
When the petition came up before three-judge-bench headed by Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, the Court was informed that several COPE committee members were yet to appear in Courts as respondents.
The petitioner Vice Secretary of the Sri Lanka Mahabodhi Society Ven. Thiniyawala Palitha Thero had cited 26 members of COPE including its chairman Sunil Hadunnetti who were tasked by Parliament of Sri Lanka to investigate and report on matters pertaining to certain Treasury bond auctions, the Monetary Board of the Central Bank, the Governor of the CBSL, Chairman of the Tender Committee of the CBSL and Superintendent of the Public Debt Department of the CBSL, the Auditor General of Sri Lanka and the Attorney General as respondents in the petition.
The petitioner stated that consequent to being elected in September 2015, Parliament of Sri Lanka appointed the members of COPE to conduct an investigation into certain Central Bank auctions of Treasury Bonds which occurred in February 2015 and March 2016.
The members of COPE have submitted their final report to Parliament on or about 28 October 2016.
The said COPE report maintains that; the 1st, 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 9th, 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th 18th, 21st, 22nd, 24th and 26th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report in general without the footnotes.
The 6th,7th, 8th, 10th, 11th, 13th, 20th, 23rd and 25th Respondents agreed to the said COPE report with the footnotes.
The all members of thecommittee (i.e.the 1stto26th respondents) unanimously agreed to the recommendations given at the end of the report. 
The Petitioner expressly pleads that notwithstanding that the said COPE report was presented to Parliament on or about 28 October 2016, the same remained inaccessible to the general public and the Petitioner for some time. The Petitioner pleads that the said COPE report only became accessible to the Petitioner on or about 24 November 2016.
In the circumstances afore-said, the Petitioner pleads that the Petitioner could not file this application sooner as the COPE report was inaccessible to him, and he was not aware of the contents of the same, until 24 November 2016. 14.
The Petitioner further stated that in any event the continuous reliance or circulation or actions of the said COPE report as it presently stands amounts to a continuing infringement of the Petitioners fundamental rights guaranteed under Article 12(1) of the Constitution of Sri Lanka, and also amounts to a cause which enables the Petitioner to prefer this application in the public interest. 
The Petitioner pleads that through the said COPE report, the Petitioner and the general public have been misinformed and misled. 
The Petitioner said that in the event that the CBSL was not properly or officially or lawfully issuing Treasury Bonds viz the direct/private placement from the month of January 2009, the proper procedure that ought to have been followed from January 2009 was the Central Bank Treasury bond auction process.

Get the  balance  right!
Getting involved in activities outside the classroom gives students greater opportunities to develop character, critical thinking skills, social skills, and talents. The Duke of Edinburghs International Award equips young people for life and work. It emphasizes that not all learning happens in the classroom. Young people need experiences outside the classroom to become committed, responsible and fulfilled citizens of the world.
Two students of Gothami Balika Vidyalaya, Colombo, Dinusha Kalpani and Manonitha Perera, proved that they are diversely talented when they managed to reach the Gold Level in the international competition. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe presented them with the Award in March. The Award is available to all 14 to 24 year olds and is considered as the worlds leading youth achievement award.
Your journey towards achieving the Award is a personal challenge and not a competition against others. You design your own Award program, set your own goals and record your own progress. It pushes young people to their personal limits and recognizes their achievements, Dinusha said.
Crossing Belihuloya
Manonitha notes that when their teachers Sriyani Edirisinghe and Sandya Mayadunne introduced this Award she thought that it would be a good opportunity to identify her own skills and capabilities.
I believed that it would create a platform to improve my personality by developing qualities such as leadership and harnessing the confidence to take part in events in the future without shying away from the limelight, she added.
Since its launch in 1956 by The Duke of Edinburgh, husband to Queen Elizabeth II of UK, the Award has inspired millions of young people to transform their lives. Over eight million young people have participated in the Award competition in over 140 countries and territories. The Award can play a critical role in a youths personal development via non formal education. To reach the award one needs to complete three levels and four sections: service, skills, physical recreation and adventurous journey. All four sections need to be completed at each level. The participants need to complete a residential project as well when they reach the Gold Level. The competition gets tougher at each level leaving room for the individuals to test their skills. A participant gets three months to complete their work during the Bronze Level while he or she gets six months for the Silver Level and one year for the Gold Level.
Dinusha KalpaniManonitha Perera
The Service section of the Award encourages young people to volunteer their time to and understand the benefits of this service to their community. The Skills section encourages the development of personal interests and practical and social skills. The Physical Recreation section motivates young people to participate in some form of physical recreation for the improvement of health and fitness. The Adventurous Journey section triggers a sense of adventure while undertaking a team journey or expedition. Participants will plan, train for and undertake a journey with a defined purpose in an unfamiliar environment. The Residential Project, completed only at Gold level, aims to broaden participants horizons through involvement with others in a residential setting.
Dinusha has written short stories for the Bronze Level. For the Silver Level and Gold Level she has engaged in sewing. She says that this helped her hone her sewing skills so that she is able to sew any type of garment now.
Going to Baththaramulla Forest Conservation Headquarters has been their pre adventurous journey for the Bronze Level. Their adventurous journey had been from Ganemulla Girl Guide Training Headquarters to Horagolla.
The duo and a group of about 20 more had gone to Ragama Tea Estate Church for the pre adventurous journey for the Silver Level while their adventurous journey had been to do research on the ancient ruins in Anuradhapura while staying at Saliya Army Camp.
For the Gold Level Dinushas service project has been to help out at the Sarana Elderly Home in Athurugiriya. She also gave them tea once per month using money that she has earned through giving tuition classes to a few school children. Her service for Bronze Level was to assist a teacher while she is teaching English to small children in the afternoons. She has taught a few grade two students under the teachers guidance for the Silver Level.
The girls had visited four temples in Gampaha doing research on King Valagambas activities there for their pre adventurous journey for the Gold Level. Their adventurous journey had been to climb and do research on the Belihuloyas Paraviyangala mountain range.
That was one of the most memorable and challenging moments in the whole competition. We ventured 23 km and out of that 11 km was on foot. We hiked a 15 000 ft mountain. It was a difficult climb because your hands get scratched when you struggle to climb upwards by clinging to the ground. Seven of us along with two elders undertook that event. It was an out of this world kind of experience, Dinusha explained.
Her residential project has been in Panagamuwa, Kegalle, where she did a research on the eating habits and health factors of the residents. She found out that the residents have a two percent risk in getting cancer because they have begun to use artificial manure for their crops.

Manonitha had taught grade three and four students to improve their literacy using diverse methods as her service for both the Bronze Level and Silver Levels. Swimming was her physical recreation project for the Bronze Level while she chose to learn to play the violin as her skill.
She shifted to the flute for the Silver Level and took up dancing as her physical recreation project. She had learnt Pa Saramba, Goda Saramba and practiced three Wannam including Adaw and Kasthiram.
Manonithas service for the Gold Level was to teach knots, first aid and camp fire songs to scouts and see that they are well prepared for a camp. She chose to sew saree jackets. She mastered various sewing styles and ended up sewing on the sewing machine. She learnt to ride a bicycle and eventually rode it from Dematagoda to Ambathale.

Dinusha said that many youths log book had been rejected because they have not followed the rules of the competition accurately. Her log book has been 110 pages long and handwritten.
You need to plan your actions and strategies as well as note down you goals before engaging in the activity. Then stick to that plan. You need to capture all the activities via photographs and include them in the log book. A mediator has to grade your prowess, Manonitha said.
Manonitha has three brothers in her family. Her mother, Priyanka Kumarasinghe, is a music teacher and her father, N M Perera, is a retired army officer. Dinushas father, W H Chandralal, is an operation manager at a leading company while her mother, T K Wettasinghe, is a school principal.
Dinusha is the deputy head girl of Gothami Balika Vidyalaya while Manonitha is a senior prefect and a member of the youth parliament. They attribute all their triumphs in life to being Girl Guides and taking part in The Duke of Edinburghs International Award.
Only 13 of us managed to reach the Gold Level at the last competition. Out of those there were only six who had completed each level. The others have just reached the Gold Level in 18 months, Dinusha said.
She adds that youth need to take part in extracurricular activities to sooth their minds. This creates a balance in life. Studies alone will create stress.
We should learn well by referring to books. We have lots of people to guide us in education but we need to engage in extracurricular activities to gain life experiences. It is up to us to improve our leadership, responsiveness, quality of changing challenges. Extracurricular activities develop those qualities. We can study the behaviour of the people in the society, and their way of facing the challenges. If you aware of your pros and cons then you will be able to balance everything, Manonitha concluded.

## Section: Features

Good governance through productive electoral reforms
It is evident that the government is still short of setting up a robust system for Good Governance through Electoral reforms. In the circumstances, arising from my presentation to the Public Committee on Constitutional Reforms, I wish to enlist my recommendations and highlight the benefits accruing therefrom to the country through the following electoral reforms most of which can be introduced without going for a referendum.
1) Repeal the infamous, optional Preference Voting System and bring back the District merit list of nominees (Please also refer 3 c below). Accordingly, there will be no need for aspiring MPs who will be at the top of the Administration Pyramid to collect preference votes by resorting to unethical and extravagant measures. Therefore, they need not be allocated with Decentralized funds. On the contrary, they should monitor the usage and recommend the allocation and release of decentralized funds to the lower layers of the Pyramid at Provincial Council (PC) and Pradeshiya Sabha (PS) level. The existing monitoring mechanism through District Development Committees should be reviewed to facilitate a Bottom-up approach.
2) The present Decentralized Political Administrative Structure should be made more productive by specifically laying down the Role responsibilities and limits for the respective layers in the Pyramid viz. The Parliament, PCs and PSs avoiding overlapping job roles. In our view, there is a need to reduce the powers of MPs who are mainly Law-makers and transfer them to the PCs and PSs which in the process should get more mileage from the media as they are closer to the public than the National level MPs.
3) National election process
a) The primary and the most critical need at a National election process is to determine the winner and the number of seats won by each Party/Alliance out of 225 seats in the Parliament. It can be guaranteed, only by applying proportionate arithmetic to the total valid National vote considering the entire country as one Electorate thereby ensuring an equal value for all valid votes. This will obviate the need for laborious and costly delimitation exercises before a National Election.
b) Next is the District-wise allocation of seats out of the total number of seats won by each Party/Alliance. It also can be done by applying proportionate arithmetic to District-wise number of votes mustered by each Party/Alliance.
c) Thereafter, nominating MPs to each District will be automatic as District wise Nomination lists in merit order are already publicized by each Party/Alliance. Presently, this list is furnished in the Alphabetical order to cover 196 seats. For Good Governance and logical purposes, this list needs to be seen by the voter in the order of merit so that he will get an idea of the calibre and the quality of the persons who are likely to represent him in the National Parliament.
The real objective of the National list (29) too can be achieved by including those nominations also in the District lists so that one can visualize one master- nomination list of professional politicians fielded by each Party/Alliance sub-divided into 22 or 25 Districts. The nominating Parties/Alliances may be allowed to add 3 or 4 extra nominees (also in merit order) to the bottom of their each District Merit nomination lists to provide for Resignations/Deaths/expulsions. Thus, the sole responsibility of selecting Professional nominees in merit order will fully devolve on the respective Parties/Alliances and not on the voter. For this purpose, as corporate bodies, they should evolve a transparent, structured interview system acceptable to the people, to select their nominees. They should possess the discipline and clout to select and deal with their nominees under a well-designed system of Good Governance and transparent mechanisms. The voter will take into account, the quality, character and efficiency of such nominees who have to implement the party manifesto and action plans as a team in the event of victory.
As a result of having a merit list, the Ballot paper will carry only Party/Alliance symbols and the Elections Department will have less work in the counting process enabling the people to know the Election results before mid night!
4) As aforesaid, in a modern Representative Democracy the voter expects the Political Parties to be corporate bodies with ability to produce powerful Manifestos and pragmatic Action plans for the Party/Alliance. Since the Election Manifesto becomes critical for voter decision, it has to be made a legally enforceable document.
5) With this District merit list in place, the Cross-over mockery also will die a natural death as in the event of Death/ Resignation/Expulsion of an MP, the next person in the merit list has to be automatically appointed. This in fact was the original mechanism laid down under JRs Constitution till it got subverted by the present Preference voting method. However, in our view this crossover farce needs to be sealed constitutionally without leaving any legal loopholes.
6) To reach zenith of Good-Governance process, apply PR arithmetic to allocate Cabinet portfolios (numbering 30 already specified by constitution), so that all seat winning parties will be represented in the Cabinet. This will ensure Cabinet Portfolios to smaller parties like TNA and JVP and in the process, answer the promised + component of the much maligned 13th Amendment which has become irreversible due to its international implications.
7) The present provision for Parliament to increase the number of Cabinet portfolio at will should be replaced with a specific, tolerance limit of say + or - 5 of the constitutionally specified number which presently stands at 30.
8) Good Governance demands that the President acts as a Statesman cum Caretaker' of the people devoid of political hues, Ethnicity and Religion. Accordingly, he should be prevented by law from engaging in any kind of Party politics during the term of his office.
9) Dictatorial powers, if any, of the President should be removed in keeping with the much hackneyed public outcry.
10) To derive maximum cost-benefit for the country as well as to obtain rational election results from the voters, the Presidential Election and the National election should be held on one specified day enshrined in the Constitution.
11) Similarly, it is rational that the Provincial Council elections too be held on one legally specified day.
12) PSs should be depoliticized allowing the people to elect independent, educated, social-minded, acceptable/respectable persons with high integrity in the locality. At local level, people need grass-root development facilitators cum ombudsmen and not politicians who are compelled to recover their campaign expenditure by hook or by crook.
Other related issues
a) Given a decentralized Political Administration system of Governance, it is imperative to rationalize the number of MPs (225) through a proper work study based on well-defined objectives and role responsibilities. Examples from countries in the region need to be taken in to account in order to constitutionalize a formula of 01 MP for X number of registered voters. In our view even the present 225 is an unproductive assemblage.
b) MPs salaries and perks should be recommended by an independent Committee comprising productivity and work study experts. If this happened before, the tax-payer would have saved the enormous financial burdens arising from the present guarantee of five year Pension and Duty free vehicles for MPs. The MPs colluding to increase their own salaries and perks is tantamount to a Conflict of interest.
Need for a new political and media culture
The above measures elicit a Paradigm-Shift in the political culture, approach and attitudes of both politicians and the people. The voters should change their attitudes and refrain from approaching any National level MP to solve their local problems. This change of attitude will automatically happen if the Government ensures Yahapalanaya in the most important public institutions viz. the Police Service, the Judiciary and the Government Service. In extreme circumstances, a voter may approach an independent local PC or a PS member to overcome administrative delays. Also, it must be noted that under Yahapalanaya, political interference is taboo!
It is very evident that the mass media and of late, the social media solely possess the power and stamina to bring about this most crucial Paradigm shift. Towards this end, the media at the outset, have to change their approach to prioritize and report Countrys regional development efforts with a positive outlook followed by a well-balanced reportage of issues leaving the viewers/readers to decide rather than going for popular, sensational, competitive, one-upmanship in reporting.
It would be seen that all the aforesaid measures, if implemented in good faith and with political will, will reduce unnecessary waste of time, material and energy by the politicians and the people leading to increases in productivity.
The presence of patriotic, professional politicians who place the country first in their agenda will no doubt take the Parliament from Confrontational Politics to one of Consensual and rational politics allowing the country to develop in harmony. In this scenario, what is best for the country will always happen and the question of Hung Parliament will become a misnomer.
Last but not the least; it will also remove a massive volume of unproductive work load of the Elections Department.

Govt could fulfil yet another election pledge by regaining GST+ : Harsha
The government could fulfill another UNP election pledge by obtaining the GSP+ facility from the European Union, said Foreign Affairs Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva.
He also said that with the support of President Maithripala Sirisena, the unity government could obtain the GSP+ facility that the previous government deprived the country of. He added as this government had guaranteed good governance, democracy, human rights and the country could obtain the GSP+ facility.
"UNP Leader and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe worked really hard to obtain the GSP+ facility back," the Foreign Deputy Minister said. "He appointed committees, worked on holidays, worked with the Foreign Ministry, the Cabinet and other involved institutions to get it back. Its benefits would enrich the entire country. This facility is women friendly, youth friendly and rural friendly."
He made these observations yesterday, at a Press conference held at the Sirikotha, the Political Headquarters of the UNP.
Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva further said that the government has decided to grant a depreciation allowance to investors in Sri Lanka to promote investments. He added that the Finance Minister would present the Inland Revenue Act in the near future, which would provide the depreciation allowance for the investors.
He also said that the estimated profit that the country would earn an year due to GSP+ facility is nearly US$ 600 million and it would increase in yearly in future. He added that foreign investors asked as to what the other incentives they could receive to make their investments in Sri Lanka.
"We have to give competitive incentives than countries such as Vietnam, Bangladesh, Malaysia Thailand, etc." Deputy Minister Harsha de Silva said. "So after discussions, we have decided to grant them a depreciation allowance of 100 percent across the country. However, the same allowance would be 200 percent to the investment made in the Northern Province."
The Deputy Minister further said that the employees of the fisheries sector would receive the benefits instantly as the harvest on Friday could be exported to Germany on Saturday to enjoy the 18 percent tax reduction to zero. He added that the tax on garments to the EU is 10 percent, while the tax on miscellaneous edible preparations is 14 percent and all these would come to zero from Friday.
He also said that due to developments in the good governance government, the EU unilaterally opened their gates to our products.
Questioned by a media personnel if the government had a mechanism to ensure that the massive amount of money saved with the GSP+ facility be shared with the employees, the Deputy Minister said that the government hoped so and urge them to do so. He added that however the government could not impose laws on the same matter.

GSP+ to trigger export oriented economy - PM
Enhanced Market access to boost trade:
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said the decision to grant Sri Lanka enhanced market access under GSP+ can be considered as the beginning of an export oriented economy.
With the GSP+ concession Sri Lanka will enter the European market. It is a significant landmark of the countrys economy and moreover it is the beginning of an export oriented economy the Prime Minister added.
The Prime Minister made these remarks addressing the inauguration of The Women Leadership Summit 2017 of SAARC Chamber of Women Entrepreneurs Council in Colombo yesterday.
The Women Leadership Summit 2017 was held under the theme Empowering women in South Asia with the participation of representation of SAARC countries.
The Prime Minister said the South Asian region is the fastest growing region in the world. When considering this trend it is vital to concentrate on the total women participation in the economic activities and trade integration, he said.
The Prime Minister highlighted that the administrative barriers should be removed to reach the harvest of economic growth.
South Asia has a good future. If we look at 2050, some countries such India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Myanmar and some East African countries and part of West-Asia will mark a tremendous growth in population. With the growth, we are fully integrated. We must ensure that women have the right for full participation in economic activities the Prime Minister noted.
We must concentrate on increasing economic activities and increasing womens participation in the labour force.How do we expand the labour force. It is important to open more opportunities for women to participate in the economic activities he added.
How do we get more women into the economic sphere That is where we have to focus. Besides, we should focus on how we ensure more women to enter to the high level of entrepreneurship. At the bottom it can be seen more women involvement in the labour force, but it is only a few at the top the Prime Minister said.
He mentioned that women entrepreneurs must have access for credit for further strengthen their enterprises.
The number of women in the labour force is huge at the bottom but it is a few at the top. Then we ensure that more and more women have to concentrate on how the women participation can be increased at the top level he added.
The Prime Minister said that unfortunately in South Asia there are two economies as export oriented sector and the domestic oriented sector. The domestic oriented sector services only to the domestic market while the other focuses on international market. However it is important to take measures to increase the export oriented economy. The Prime Minister pointed out that the issues of balance of payments can easily be mitigated by increasing the export sector. Speaking on the GSP Plus, he is that over 6,000 products will benefit under the GSP+. The exporters should utilize this concession by increasing the capacity of the exports. Moreover, the domestic suppliers should be asked to become export oriented entities.
We should further deepen the bilateral trade agreements. We are not revising some of the existing trade agreements or entering into new ones. These trade agreements do not affect or destroy our domestic industries overnight. It takes time. There is time for them to adjust to be more competitive. We are providing them with tax incentives and other facilities. There will be a trade agreement package, which works with the people on the ground ie the existing exporters and the existing manufacturers for the domestic market he added.
The Prime Minister said it is vital to encourage direct foreign investments and the tourism industry plays a pivotal role. Tourism sector has the potential to develop in a short period drawing a significant income. The digital economy, where there is a high level of women participation. And we have to look at the other sectors which have high potential to contribute to an economic growth.
We want to ensure a better environment for all entrepreneurs including the export oriented entrepreneurs, tourism sector entrepreneurs and digital sector based entrepreneurs aiming to make Sri Lanka a hub of the Indian Ocean, he said.

Haycarb records turnover of  Rs. 13.5 bn

Haycarb PLC reported revenue of Rs. 13.5 billion, profit before tax of Rs. 1.19 billion and profit after tax of Rs. 939 million for financial year 2016/17. The earnings per share of equity holders of the company increased to Rs. 27.07 for the year.
The Chairman of Haycarb PLC and its parent company Hayleys PLC, Mohan Pandithage said that the company posted a profit before tax of over Rs. 1 billion for the 5th consecutive year signaling the success of diversification and the resulting stability of the businesses driven by its long term strategies.
Haycarb PLC Managing Director, Rajitha Kariyawasan explained that the company was able to show both top and bottom line growth amidst key challenges in supply chain for raw material and volatility in some of its key global markets.
He added that successful development and commercialization of a number of value added high margin products, expansion of its strategic customer base and growth shown in key geographic markets together with the significant growth shown in the environmental engineering segment of the business (Puritas) helped to retain the overall performance of the group. He also said that cross functional teams delivered significant improvements in efficiencies and cost savings that added to the bottom line through lean projects that increased yields of specific equipment and product lines and reduced re-work.
The biggest challenge faced by the group in 2016/17 fiscal year is the significant shortages in charcoal supplies and resultant high prices in its Indonesian operations as a result of significant coconut crop reduction which impacted the results negatively.
This was compounded by the oversupply of activated carbon from low cost manufacturers from India and Philippines resulting in the company not being able to pass on the cost increases to the end customer.
Kariyawasan noted that a significant portion of raw material sourced in Sri Lanka and Thailand were procured through environment friendly charcoaling initiatives that have been developed and promoted amongst suppliers by providing technology and financial assistance.
The company continued to promote Haritha Angara, the environment friendly charcoaling pits in Sri Lanka as a strategic initiative, while Carbokarn supported the operation of the vertical charcoaling kiln facility.
The performance of Sri Lankan entities significantly improved due to higher production throughput, increase in the value added portfolio and stability in raw material prices achieved through its Haritha Angara program. He further added that notable performance was reported by Thailand operations, which included satisfactory growth in the regeneration business.
Kariyawasan said the environmental engineering arm Puritas (Pvt.) Ltd. has shown creditable growth in its performance by expanding its share in waste water and water purification solutions in Sri Lanka and in the Region. The significant growth shown by this segment in the last couple of years and its potential to further diversify and grow will strengthen the overall group he further added.
Kariyawasan stated that the company remains confident of its position of strength and stability in the activated carbon industry, regeneration services and the environmental engineering segment to continue the growth platform in the background of continued emphasis placed on environmental sustainability, standards and regulations globally.

Its the Principal of it !
Goolbai Gunasekara needs no introduction. The daughter of the legendary Clara Motwani, like her mother, Goolbai has upheld the highest standards of teaching while adopting an open minded, tolerant and benevolent, though always disciplinary eye on her students, all of whom hold her beloved.
The Principal of it, a collection of articles published in book form was launched recently, attended by her past and present students, her many friends and well wishers, the business and diplomatic corps, all of whom hold this remarkable woman in great esteem.
As Goolbai says, the most important character ingredient necessary for a teacher [ apart from the knowledge of the subject being taught ] is a sense of humour!
According to Goolbai the ability to teach is an art. The articles contained in her book are her observations which she has garnered over the years and which she hopes would help both students and teachers alike, not forgetting parents.
To say a love of children is vital is just not true. One may not love ones students but may enjoy teaching them. Obviously one needs to like them, but sentimental reasons for becoming a teacher have never been on the cards for me.
Though teaching has been dubbed a noble profession, Goolbai laments the fact that it is one of the worst paid. Goolbai has always advocated better pay for those in her profession and hopes that a time will soon come when teachers are adequately recompensed.
Goolbais fans are legion as was evidenced by those who thronged her book launch, while her witty and pertinent observations on her charges hold true not just today but for generations to come .
Its the Principal of it guarantees many an hour of happy reading and much laughter, leaving you wanting to constantly dip into its pages whenever time permits. -AD

Its wonderful to start the tournament as underdogs - Ford
Lankan cricketers leave for Champions Trophy with great expectations:
Head coach Graham Ford said despite to all what has been said about preparations and winning the tournament he was comfortable for Sri Lanka to go into the ICC Champions Trophy as underdogs.
Youve got to be realistic and accept that we go to this tournament as underdogs. Sometimes thats a wonderful place to be, said Ford at a media conference held at Movenpick Hotel in Colpetty yesterday where the Sri Lanka team was present for an official photograph and media conference.
If you look at the records of some of the other teams that well come up against  they certainly have more impressive records than we have. We have a young side, with a lot of players who have made a lot of progress over the last year or so.
Also because of our slightly up and down year, weve been able to really identify areas that we need to improve on  our weak areas. I know that the lads are very determined to improve on those areas, he said.
Sri Lanka are drawn in Group B with South Africa, India and Pakistan  all three teams against whom they have not fared well in recent times.
For the teams that were going to play against have had successful years, the danger for them is they can drop their guard a little bit, observed Ford. They can think everything is going swimmingly well, and not focus on those areas they need to improve on. For me, I think were in quite a good position. Whilst its going to be a massive challenge going up against some wonderful cricketers, Im very confident that we have the players that can cause some upsets and play exciting cricket.
I certainly think the fans are going to have a lot of enjoyment out of it, and I hope our players are going to get some enjoyment out of it. At the same time, we all realise that it is a huge, huge event for us and a huge challenge, he said.
Ford lauds players
Ford commended the players the way they have prepared themselves for the tournament.
They have had quite a tough time of it over the last few weeks or so. Some of them have actually been playing flat out in all formats of the game since September when we went to Zimbabwe, said Ford.
Some have had a very hectic time, but at no stage did they take their foot off the pedal. Its great to see the way theyve worked. One thing Im very proud of, and one reason Im involved in Sri Lankan cricket is the fighting spirit that our players show. It is the most impressive in world cricket.
Ford admitted preparing the Lankan team for the Champions trophy was a big ask.
Recent results will tell you that it is a big ask. But the talent these guys have shown, every single member is a match winner in his own right, said Ford.
Theyve worked extremely hard and theyre all trying to improve their cricket. With us being a team thats improving all the time, weve certainly got a chance of upsetting one of these other nations. It is a huge challenge, but one that were looking forward to.
One advantage Sri Lanka has with Ford being their head coach is that he is quite familiar with the London Oval where Sri Lanka play their first two matches of the Champions trophy against South Africa (on June 3) and India (on June 8). Ford was coach of Surrey (home of the Oval) for two seasons since 2014 before being reappointed Sri Lanka coach in 2016.
Fortunately we play two of our home games at the Oval, which I know very well. From what Ive seen, its been a particularly dry start to the summer, and the scores have been really high. That should suit us, said Ford.
Im not actually sure we want it to spin much, because Imran Thahir is a real weapon for South Africa and Ravichandran Ashwin and the Indian spinners will be a factor. Were looking for good cricket wickets  good one-day pitches, he said.
If you look at the scores of the one-day competition on now in England, they have been really high. Hopefully those are the kinds of pitches that we can perform well on. You never know with the weather  a wet spell could come in. For now its all looking really promising.
Fielding is our strength
When questioned of the teams strength Ford wryly said, I would say fielding, but you might all start laughing. Weve certainly done a lot of our fielding, so hopefully thats going to stand up well.
In one day cricket we have some exceptional stroke-makers and some really talented batsmen, and thats why if the batting pitches are good, we can really put bowling attacks under pressure. Perhaps with some of our younger players who are still learning to construct innings, the challenge is to make sure were in a position to put attacks under a lot of pressure at the end.
If you do construct an innings well, we have some of the best ball strikers in world cricket. They can really take a bowling attack down.
Bowling wise if we can get the old guard of (Lasith) Malinga and (Nuwan) Kulasekara firing with their skills at the end of the innings, that probably takes 20-25 runs off the opposition score as well. Its a combination of finishing the innings off really well with the ball, and of course setting ourselves up well with the bat, he said.

IUSF protest: Eight arrested, five cops injured
Eight people including a Buddhist Monk who behaved in an unlawful manner during yesterdays Inter University Students Federation(IUSF) protest at Town Hall were arrested, the Police said.
Five Policemen who were injured while trying to disperse members of the IUSF who engaged in the protest defying a court ruling were admitted to the Narahenpita Police hospital, the Police media unit said.
Meanwhile,IUSF sources said that over 10 members who participated in the protest were admitted to hospital with injuries sustained due to alleged Police assaults.
The Police used tear gas and water cannon to disperse the protesters who blocked roads and caused traffic jams, inconveniencing the public.
The IUSF said yesterdays protest was mainly over abolishing the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine.
In addition the IUSF demanded the government to take action on university admission shortages, to allocate six percent of funds to education, to refrain from money charges within school systems, stop selling government organisations and to refrain from making ETCA agreements between India and Sri Lanka.

Japan monarchy: Princess Mako to lose royal status by marrying commoner

A member of Japan's royal family, Princess Mako, is to surrender her royal status by marrying a commoner.
The 25-year-old eldest granddaughter of Emperor Akihito will become engaged to law firm worker Kei Komuro, also 25, whom she met while studying together.
Japan's imperial law requires a princess to leave the royal family after marrying a commoner.
The move, first reported by local media, is expected to reignite debate on the ever-shrinking royal family.
Princess Mako and Kei Komuro met in 2012 when they studied at the International Christian University in Tokyo.
He once worked as "Prince of the Sea", promoting tourism in Japan.
Asked about their engagement plans, Komuro on Wednesday was quoted as saying: "Now is not the time for me to comment, but I want to speak at the right time."
The Imperial Householdconfirmed for US broadcaster CNNthat plans were under way for the princess's engagement.
Emperor Akihito, 83,hinted last Augustthat he wanted to stand down, saying his age could interfere with his duties.
Japan is currently considering legal changes to allow the emperor to abdicate.
No Japanese emperor has abdicated for two centuries and the law currently does not allow it but new legislation is expected to leave unchanged a males-only succession law.
There are only four heirs to the Chrysanthemum Throne: Akihito's sons Crown Prince Naruhito and Prince Fumihito, Prince Hisahito (Fumihito's son) and the emperor's younger brother, Prince Masahito.

Jobs of ministers critical of govt are at stake: Wijepala Hettiarachchi
Those who criticise the government while being within it must know that their ministerial posts are at stake if the government topples, UNP Galle District MP Wijepala Hettiarachchi said.
Addressing a meeting in Galle yesterday, he said some who are clinging onto ministerial posts in the Yahapalana Government were trying to show off their powers to the UNP.
President Maithripala Sirisena will never join the Joint Opposition. He will not kick the ladder that helped him to climb high. If anybody is hoping to form a government with JO MPs, he must know that it is only a pipe dream, he said.
Some SLFP ministers have double standards. They are ready to join former President Mahinda Rajapaksa if needed. We are not like that and our sole aim is developing the country and safeguarding the democracy, he said.

Kandy schools rugby round-up
This time around, we have as many as four schools still very much in the hunt to win the Singer Schools Rugby Cup championship. This is a rarity. From a rugby standpoint, this is huge, as it shows just how much the game (at least at school level) has improved. In the years gone by, it used to be very much a two-horse race at best. This alone makes for some intriguing viewing over the next couple of weeks.
Trinity and St. Anthonys are close to the Cup and the Plate trophy. Trinity defeated Isipathana after 2012 in their inter school cup competition match. With this win Trinity are close to repeating their feat of 1987 when they last won the league title. The cup will be in their hands if they beat Royal at Saturdays game. In the history of the league Trinity has won it three times - first in the second year of the tournament in 1974 under C.Y. Ching Snr. Then in 1977 under R. Balasuriya and the last was in 1987 under T.Rajapakse. Now they head into their deciding game of this year's Cup Championship knowing they need just a win to secure the title.
Last week Dharmarajah College also won when they beat Science College in a Plate game. St. Anthonys College who beat Prince of Wales in their last outing are also close to the Plate title. Kingswood College beat Lumbini College comfortably, so this time these three Kandy schools Dharmaraja, St Anthonys and Kingswood are sure to be climb up to division I. Vidyartha College with a young side is having a lean season, in their last outing they went down to D.S. Senanayake College. Sri Rahula College playing the division II cup was beaten by Vidyaloka Vidyala Galle; St. Sylvesters College playing in the Bowl beat Richmond College, Sri Sumangala failed to play their Shield game due to Wesak.
Trinity cleared a tough hurdle last week at Pallekele when they registered a glorious 15 points to 10 victory over Isipathana. They went into the match knowing that a win was all they needed to get closer to clinching the title. Trinitians and the Pathanians started the Saturdays matches on equal term. It was the host who led the standings on better score difference at half time. Both teams cheered the large fans, by putting up a superb display of rugby. Trinity scoring five tries three conversions and three penalties against the Pathanians two tries. Avesha Priumakara and Reshan Bandaranayake was the toast for Trinitians with a try each, while Leshan Wijesuriya the play maker fired the kicks at goal. For the losers Haritha Bandara and Chamod Fernando chipped in with one try each.
Dharmaraja completed a smashing 25-17 victory over Science College in a Plate competition encounter, which was worked off at Nittawella grounds. The Rajans who have been doing well in the second round got into business from the kick off and virtually dominated the forwards and back division play. But more importantly they were quite outstanding in the loose play and combined well in the rucks and mauls. The Rajans had more terrestrial advantage and this made them score the points. The outstanding feature of the game was splendid touch finding of the Rajans, most of the kicks put in the shade the efforts of the Science team backs in the trails that followed this game. Rajans however failed to pocket the bonus points. Their next game is on Saturday at Ratmalana with Prince of Wales.
Kingswood scored a massive 60 points to 8 victory over Lumbini College in a Plate trophy encounter played in Colombo. Kingswood controlled the game throughout their hard working forwards to have had enough ball from the loose play and really rattled the opposition. Their backs too did what was needed and warmed up for the next showdown against D.S. Senanayake College on Monday at Navy grounds Welisara.
St. Anthonys in the Plate competition made the highest score of the season against Prince of Wales as they ran up seventeen tries, out of which ten were goalled. It was an impressive victory. Antonians went about their task in the most spectacular manner while running down the tries. They completely dominated the game with forwards and three quarters combining beautifully. Their halves combination clicked well with their backs controlling the game beautifully, but more importantly the forwards had a superb game. The Antonians need to beat Science College in their next outing on Sunday to lift the Plate championship and they should have no problem doing it.
Viidyartha from whom much was expected failed to do their best. They started with a bang and failed to live up to the end. They have a young set of players, who are sure to play for another three seasons, win or lose they give their maximum. D.S. Senanayake College gave a good display to beat Vidyartha. The next game for Vidyartha is on May 21 against Lumbini in Colombo.
Sri Rahulas Division II Cup competition game against Vidiyaloka College did not come off. They were due to host Bandaranayake MV Gampaha at the Peradeniya Campus grounds yesterday.
St. Sylvesters playing in the Bow went down to Thurstan College and in their last game played on Monday beat Richmond College. Their next game is against Mahanama College.
Sri Sumangalas Shield competition match against Athulathamudali MV was not played due to any ground being available. They are hoping to play on May 24 at Peradeniya Campus grounds. Tomorrow they will play Eheliyagoda Central at Peradeniya Campus grounds commencing at 2 pm, as they have to hand over the grounds by 4 pm for the University sports activities.

Lanka sees unprecedented economic revival: PM in Beijing
Sri Lanka achieved massive economic victories in international and local fronts during the last two years. Such an era of hope had never dawned on the country before, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said in Beijing, China.
The Prime Minister made these observations addressing the members of the Sri Lanka Media at the conclusion of his visit to China.
The Prime Minister said the consensual national government led by President Maithripala Sirisena has been promoting peoples welfare and development without resorting to cheap publicity to deceive the people.
He said: We participated in the one belt one road summit. Countries attending the summit agreed on creating economic and trade relations and coordination among the participants. Each country is supposed to work according to this framework.
The Prime Minister said: Although China summoned the summit, the IMF and the World Bank too agreed to join it. We can expect more organisations to join the endeavour. What is important for Sri Lanka is to take the next step in this direction. This road will not only improve infrastructure facilities but create the possibility to develop trade, industries and the economy and provide more employment.
The Prime Minister said: I along with ministers in my delegation discussed these matters with the Chinese President and Prime Minister. We also dismissed the progress achieved on the programmes launched under the agreement reached last year.
We should move forward towards the next step after reviewing the progress achieved by the Port City project and the Hambantota Port project. We also drew attention towards making Colombo a navigation hub with the progress achieved by the Hambantota and Colombo Ports, creating industries at Hambantota and providing opportunities for Chinese and other international investors in them.
We discussed measures to transform the Port City project into a financial city and develop it as a regional financial hub. The Chinese President and Prime Minister promised to provide greater assistance towards the development of Sri Lanka in the next few years. I should emphasise that the one belt one road programme is a successful project, he said.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said: It should be emphasised that a series of significant events for Sri Lanka occurred during the last two months. President Sirisena visited Russia and met Russian President Vladimir Putin. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi undertook a tour of Sri Lanka.
Before that I visited India and met Prime Minister Modi. In the second week of April 9, I visited Japan and met Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. All this will create vast economic benefits to Sri Lanka, he said.
Sri Lanka will receive the GSP plus facility today. This shows that we were able to obtain benefits from powerful nations and organisations within a short period. We are making this endeavour in the interests of the country. I would like to ask whether there had been such a bright era for the country before, the Prime Minister said.
We dont resort to drum beating. We work hard for the progress of the country by keeping our mouths shut, he said.
Sri Lankas Ambassador to China Dr. Karunasena Kodituwakku said the Chinese President had agreed to make special financial grants to Sri Lanka this year.
About 400 million Yuan will be received this year.
The Chinese President promised two billion Yuan during the 2018-2020 period.
Although Sri Lankan leaders had visited China before, this is the first time China had pledged such colossal funds to Sri Lanka.
The Chinese President praised Prime Minister Wickremesinghe for attending the summit. Sri Lanka will receive aid from the Silk Route Fund and the ADB. Special Projects Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama and Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickreme also spoke.

Petition challenging appointment of SF as MP re-fixed for support
The Supreme Court yesterday, re-fixed for support on July 12 a petition filed by retired Army Officer and former Southern Provincial Councilor Ajith Prasanna challenging the appointment of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka as a Member of Parliament.
The petitioner had sought an order in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto declaring that the Democratic Party Leader Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is disqualified and not entitled to be elected as a Member of Parliament of the United National Party and thus not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament. The petitioner had cited MP Sarath Fonseka, UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim, Election Commission Chairman Mahinda Deshapriya and three others as respondents.
The Petitioner stated that it is a mutation of the franchise of the people of Sri Lanka to permit Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka be declared elected as a member of the National List of the UNP wherein he was not a candidate (in the District Lists or National List) of the UNP at the time of the Parliamentary Elections 2015. The Petitioner further stated that the nomination of Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka who was not a candidate of the UNP at the time of Parliamentary Elections 2015, is abhorrent and repugnant to every known principle of Democracy, Franchise and the founding principles of franchise and proportional representation and the applicable provisions of the Constitution and the Parliamentary Elections Act.
The Petitioner specifically states that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka has now usurped and unlawfully exercised powers of a Member of Parliament, despite not being qualified to hold such position and the Petitioner is entitled to seek a mandate in the nature of a Writ of Quo Warranto requiring Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka to demonstrate as to under what authority he claims to hold office as a Member of Parliament.
The Petitioner states that the Petitioner is entitled to a declaration from Court declaring that Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka is not entitled to hold office as a Member of Parliament.

Petroleum unions wave red flag again
The Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) Trade Unions yesterday warned of a continuous islandwide strike.
The unions are demanding a concrete answer to the issue regarding the Trincomalee tank farm lease issue within this week.
CPC Trade Unions Collective Convener D. J. Rajakaruna speaking told Daily News yesterday that they wrote to Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe informing the above decision.
We have given time to the Government to address our concerns on the Trincomalee oil tank farm. If this was not done, we will be forced to resume the strike which was temporarily called off on April 24, he said.
He said even though the Prime Minister did not sign any legal agreement pertaining to the Trincomalee oil tanks during his visit to India as agreed, it has been included in the MoU signed between the two countries.
As of the time frame in the MoU, the deal has to be finalized by July. That means the drafting of agreement should start now as it needs several weeks to get the approval of the Attorney General and Cabinet. Therefore we need to bring this issue to the limelight prior to being inked he pointed out.
He also said a leaflet campaign to raise public awareness on the facts of the Trincomalee Oil Tank Farm was carried out yesterday in Fort, Kolonnawa, Maradana, Dematagoda, Kiribathgoda and Sapugaskanda.
The Government was trying to establish a distorted opinion that the oil tank farm was of no avail. We replied to these claims through our leaflet campaign, he said.
CPC Chairman Nandun Fernando said they were not yet officially informed of trade union action.He said there had been no disruption by the workers leaflet campaign.

Pune stun Mumbai to reach IPL final
Mumbai: Young Indian spinner Washington Sunder claimed three wickets to help Rising Pune Supergiant reach their maiden Indian Premier League final after beating Mumbai Indians by 20 runs in the first qualifier on Tuesday.
Chasing 163 for victory, table-toppers Mumbai faltered against a disciplined Pune bowling attack to end on 142 for nine in 20 overs. Parthiv Patel top-scored with 52.
Put into bat first, Pune's batsmen were also at the receiving end of some inspired Mumbai bowling as they struggled to get quick runs on a seemingly slow track and end on 162-4.
Pune batsmen Manoj Tiwary (58) and Ajinkya Rahane (56) recorded gritty half-centuries to ensure a competitive target for the home team at Mumbai's Wankhede Stadium.
But it was 17-year-old Sunder who turned it round for Pune with his impressive figures of 3-16, making up for the absence of star all-rounder Ben Stokes.
Sunder, who has just played five first-class games for his south Indian state of Tamil Nadu, struck twice in his opening over including the prized scalp of opposition skipper Rohit Sharma (1).
The lanky off-spinner also got the dangerous Kieron Pollard (7), forcing the burly West Indian to flick a flattish delivery to Pune skipper Steve Smith at short mid-wicket.
Pune fast bowler Shardul Thakur also took three wickets.
Earlier there was an entertaining blitz from wicketkeeper-batsman Mahendra Singh Dhoni, whose 26-ball unbeaten 40 gave Pune the much-needed push in the final few overs. AFP

Rajinikanth evades questions on Sri Lankan Tamils

Refraining from commenting on any issue related to Sri Lankan Tamils, superstar Rajinikanth evaded question onMullivaikkal Remembrance Day today, which is observed by Sri Lankan Tamils.
The day is regarded bySri Lankan Tamilsas a remembrance for those, who died in the final stages of the Sri Lankan Civil War.
Earlier in March, Rajini called off his proposed visit to Sri Lanka to inaugurate a housing scheme following opposition from Tamil fringe groups.
"VCK chief Thirumavalavan and MDMK chief Vaiko urged me not to visit Sri Lanka. I accepted their request because of cordial relationship," Rajinikanth said.
The decision came after he met with opposition from pro-Tamil outfits in his state.
Rajinikanthwas to participate in a charity event, slated to take place on April 9.
He was scheduled to formally present keys to 150 homes built by Gnanam Foundation for the internally displaced Tamils in the island nation.
However, the visit was opposed by the Viduthalai Chiruthaigal Katchi (VCK) and Marumarlarchi Dravida Munnetra Kazhagam (DMDK).
Gnanam Foundationhas been focussing on re-building infrastructure in the key areas ofSri Lanka, which were badly affected in the civil war that took place around three decades ago.

Sharapova retires after French Open snub, Murray stunned
Rome: Maria Sharapova retired with injury in her second-round match in Rome, just hours after she was denied a wild card for the French Open, while defending champion Andy Murray crashed to a heavy defeat in his opener against Fabio Fognini on Tuesday.
Sharapova, who was wearing a bandage on her left thigh, pulled out of her contest against Croatian veteran Mirjana Lucic-Baroni while leading 4-6, 6-3, 2-1 to round out a miserable day for the five-time Grand Slam champion.
"I apologise for having to withdraw from my match with a left thigh injury," Sharapova said in a statement. "I will be getting all the necessary examinations to make sure it is not serious."
Defeat in Rome meant the 30-year-old also missed out on a chance to qualify for the main draw at Wimbledon, which she could have achieved by reaching the semi-finals in the Italian capital.
World number one Murray's Rome Masters title defence then ended worringly early as he was comfortably beaten 6-2, 6-4 by local favourite Fognini after a first-round bye.
Murray limped to another premature exit with flamboyant shotmaker Fognini bossing the Scottish top seed around at will and breaking him four times.
Murray succumbed to the Italian in just over 90 minutes and has major work to do before the start of Roland Garros in less than a fortnight.
He hasn't reached the quarter-final of a major event in 2017, with the loss to Fognini his seventh of the season.
"I'm sure there were a lot of things I could have done better. He obviously he started the match extremely well," said Murray.
"I wasn't creating enough chances on my own. The only chance I really got was when he was making errors.
"I definitely felt a little bit better... but still not close to where I would like to be, obviously."
Sharapova's exit merely intensified the spotlight on the Russian after the French tennis federation (FFT) elected not to award her a wild card into either the Roland Garros main draw or qualifying. While she will at least have a chance to qualify for Wimbledon, the French Open will now be without the twice former winner as well as Roger Federer and the pregnant Serena Williams.
"You can get a wild card when you return from injury but you cannot get a wild card when returning from a doping suspension," FFT president Bernard Giudicelli said in an internet media conference.
"I'm very sorry for Maria, very sorry for her fans," added Giudicelli. "They might be disappointed, she might be very disappointed, but it's my responsibility, my mission, to protect the high standards of the game."
Four-time Rome champion Novak Djokovic overcame Britain's Aljaz Bedene 7-6 (7/2), 6-2 for a place in the third round.
The world number two came through a tight opening set by dominating the tiebreaker before finishing off his victory amid a smattering of jeers from the crowd.
The Serb lost to Rafael Nadal in last week's Madrid semi-finals, but his quick start on Tuesday was just the tonic for Djokovic, who has never failed to reach the last eight in Rome.
"It was a little bit of a slower start, Bedene is the kind of player that gives you good rhythm. I had some good exchanges, some good games with rallies and it felt right, especially in the second set," Djokovic said.

Sri Lanka hosts debut international TT tourney
South Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship 2017:
Sri Lanka will host its first major international tabel tennis tournament when the South Asian Junior & Cadet Table Tennis Championship 2017 will work off from May 19 to 21 at the S. Thomas College Indoor Stadium, Mount Lavinia. This was revealed to the media during a press briefing at the Berjaya Hotel, Mount Lavinia on Tuesday.
The regional governing body of table tennis, the South Asian Table Tennis Federation (SATTF) under the directions of Asian table Tennis Association has conferred upon the task of hosting this important championship on the local governing body, the Table Tennis Association of Sri Lanka (TTASL) and the TTASL with the support of Sports Ministry, Colombo Municipal Council and generous sponsorships will conduct the three-day tournament.
Each South Asian country will be represented by a 14-member playing squad. According to the organising committee head Chandana Perera, five countries have conformed their participation namely, India, Pakistan, Bangladesh, Maldives and host Sri Lanka. Even though Nepal has submitted their entries, they are yet to conform participation.
The tournament will be a great opportunity for local players to gain much needed exposure at international level. TTASL hopes that the event will help to enhance teamwork dynamics, communication skills and leadership qualities among local youngsters.
"Hosting an international tournament is a hard task. Sri Lanka was approved as the host nation at the last moment. So we had to arrange everything in a great rush. Even our players had a little time for preparations with few weeks of comprehensive practices. Even though India is the obvious regional TT stronghold, if our players can prosper on home advantage, they are capable of posing a threat to India. Perera explained.
TTASL also hopes that tournaments of this magnitude will greatly help to popularise table tennis in all parts of the country with the support of a good media coverage.
The tournament will include the following events: Under 15 Team (boys), Under 15 Team (girls), Under 18 Team (boys), Under 18 Team (girls), Under 15 Singles (boys), Under 15 Singles (girls), Under 18 Singles (boys), Under 18 Singles (girls), Under 18 Doubles (boys) and Under 18 Doubles (girls).

Teejay posts Rs 2 bn net profit
Teejay Lanka PLC (formerly Textured Jersey), the Sri Lanka headquartered world-class knit fabric solutions provider, has reported revenue of Rs 22.2 billion at Group level and net profit of Rs 2 billion for the 12 months ending March 31, 2017, despite substantial increases in raw material costs during much of the year.
The Group said its achievement of 24.4 per cent top line growth and its success in keeping the reduction in net profit to 9.8 per cent were attributable to its focus during a year of volatility, on capacity utilisation, expanded operations, stringent cost controlsand improved production efficiencies.
Prices of cotton yarn, Teejays most significant direct cost component, escalated by 20 per cent during nine of the 12 months reviewed, exerting pressure on gross profit margins, which reduced by 39.7 per cent in the fourth quarter alone, the company said. Despite this challenge, the Group achieved revenue of Rs 5.8 billion (up 5.7 per cent) and net profit of Rs 494 million in that quarter.
Additionally, acceptance of higher order volumes at lower margins in preparation for growth, product mix changes, shifts and changes in end customer strategy, and a temporary countrywide stock outage in coal during the third quarter, which resulted in energy costs rising, all contributed to the Groups final annual result.
At standalone company level, Teejay Lanka posted turnover growth of 11.2 per cent to Rs 15.7 billion for the full year and net profit of Rs. 1.5 billion, reflecting an increase of 1.2 per cent over the preceding year.
This performance is a relatively strong achievement in the context of the volatility in the yarn market, Teejay Lanka PLC Chairman Bill Lam said.Improved production efficiencies, stringent overhead controls and process streamlining will play a key role in the new financial year, coupled with the pursuit of a wider customer strategy.
CEO of Teejay, Sriyan de Silva Wijeyeratne disclosed that Teejay is investing approximately US$ 15 million in capacity expansion in India in preparation for future growth through GSP and other initiatives, and that capacity will be available in the second quarter of the current financial year. Cotton price volatility is expected to ease out by around the end of Q2, and at this point we welcome the latest news currently coming in on the GSP, he stated. The company is cautiously optimistic on its expansions in India and its new ventures into Synthetics, which has so far met with good customer response.
The Teejay Group has carried through a strong balance sheet from the fourth quarter of 2016-17 with a net cash balance of Rs 2.7 billion. Consolidated Earnings per Share (EPS) for the Group stood at Rs 2.80 for the year.
Teejay is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange and supplies to some of the best international brands across the world.

Three former Schoolboy Cricketers in Champions' League squad
Peterites Lakshina Rodrigo and Santhush Gunatileka are engaged in a neck to neck tussle in the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year division contest.
Rodrigo continued to take a slim lead but anything could happen in the weeks to come. The contest has become wide open although Rodrigo is still in the lead. Rodrigo who enjoyed a lead of 239 votes over his team mate Gunathilleka in the previous week, but the gap has now been reduced to mere 25 votes by the end of the 12th weeks count.
Rodrigo retained his lead with 11,380 votes but he is closely followed by fellow Peterite Gunathilleka who has polled 11,355 votes. But the duo is expected to face a tough competition from Isipathanas Sanjula Abeywickrema who is placed third in the Division 1 competition with 9,923 votes.
Piyumal Sinhawansa of St.Annes Kurunegala and Charitha Basnayake continued to maintain their leads in the Observer-Mobitel Most Popular Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year division 11 and 111 competitions respectively.
Since the beginning of the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year contest way back in 1979, many of its award winners have made it to the Sri Lanka national team, beginning with Ranjan Madugalle and Arjuna Ranatunga. The latest in the ever-growing list are three past winners of the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year main title who have been included in the 15-member Sri Lanka squad for the ICC Champions trophy tournament which begins in England on June 1.
The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year stars who will add more weight to the Lankan squad for the eight-nation tournament are former Sri Lanka T20 captain Dinesh Chandimal, wicket-keeper batsmen Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Mendis.
Chandimal is the most experienced of the three, winning the prestigious Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2009 when he was representing Ananda College, Colombo. Former captain of Trinity College, Kandy, Dickwella won the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title in 2012. Ex-Cambrian skipper Kusal Mendis won the coveted title in 2013 and in the same year, he was chosen to captain Sri Lanka Under-19 team to Bangladesh.
The team to England will be accompanied by another past winner of the most sought after title in school cricket - Asanka Gurusinha who functions as cricket manager of the national team. Gurusinha, who played a leading role in Sri Lankas 1996 World Cup triumph, won the main title in 1985 when he was representing Nalanda.
Moreover, yet another past award winner is serving as the Chairman of Selectors  Sanath Jayasuriya, who won the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year (Outstation) title when he was representing St. Servatius College, Matara in 1988.
Twenty seven-year-old Chandimal has represented Sri Lanka in 125 ODIs to aggregate 3,199 runs with an average of 34.03. He has scored four ODI centuries and 21 fifties with a career best knock of 111. Chandimal made his Sri Lanka debut just months after he was crowned the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2009.
Chandimal is one of the most promising young batsmen who had stepped into the Sri Lanka team in recent times. He is a technically sound batsman who is capable of hitting the ball to all corners of the ground with a wide range of strokes. Ever since his Sri Lanka debut, he has shown maturity at the crease with a good temperament.
Dickwella, one of the most successful Trinity captains and a reliable top order batsman , came to the big league after winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title five years ago  having scored over 1,000 runs in the previous season.
He is an attacking left-handed wicketkeeper-batsman. Dickwella, who turns 24 later next month, has been particularly impressive in limited-overs cricket. Months after winning the main title at the Mega Show, Dickwella was called to represent Sri Lanka A in its tour of England in 2013. Since then, he has proved his class both as a top order batsman with safe hands behind the stumps.
Mendis, who had scored many match-winning innings for Prince of Wales before he was adjudged the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year in 2013, too has shown good form with the willow. Within a months after winning the Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year title four years ago, he was appointed Sri Lankas under-19 captain for the Youth World Cup.
He made his Sri Lanka debut with a blistering half century  scoring 51 off 59 balls with eight boundaries in Sri Lankas first ODI against Ireland in Dublin on June 16 last year. Since then, Mendis has figured in 25 ODIs for Sri Lanka to aggregate 845 runs at an average of 36.73. He has one century and nine fifties to his credit with a career best knock of 102.
The three Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year top award winners are set to make their presence felt in the forthcoming Champions Trophy tournament.
SLT Mobitel, the national mobile service provider, continues to provide that smart connection to the Observer Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year Contest. Under the directions of the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Telecom and SLT Mobitel P.G. Kumarasingha, the Chief Executive Officer of the SLT Mobitel Nalin Perera has made a great contribution towards the success of the event during the past decade. The Observer-Mobitel Schoolboy Cricketer of the Year continues to enjoy the longstanding association of the Sri Lanka Schools Cricket Association (SLSCA) and the Sri Lanka Cricket Umpires and Scorers Association under the blessings of Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) headed by Thilanga Sumathipala.

Top US Democrat rebuffs calls to impeach Trump
US: Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi has pushed back against isolated calls from within her party to impeach US President Donald Trump following allegations he disclosed top secret information to top Russian officials.
The minority leader in the House of Representatives was responding to calls by at least two congressional Democrats for Trump to be impeached in the wake of Mondays explosive Washington Post report.
I dont subscribe to that, Pelosi told a CNN town hall Monday night. What are the facts that you would make a case on What are the rules that he may have violated
If you dont have that case, youre just participating in more hearsay.
House Democrats Al Green and Maxine Waters have urged Congress to impeach Trump in the wake of the latest bombshell allegations, coming on the heels of the shock firing of FBI director James Comey last week.
The lawmakers say Trumps dismissal of Comey -- who was overseeing probes into possible Trump campaign collusion with Russia to skew the 2016 election -- amounts to an attempt to hinder the counterintelligence investigations.
A number of media personalities urged the president to resign following the claim that he divulged highly classified information about the Islamic State group to the Russian foreign minister, Sergei Lavrov, and its ambassador to Moscow Sergey Kislyak.
The President should resign, wrote David Frum, a conservative editorial writer for the Atlantic, a call echoed by influential TV satirist Stephen Colbert who urged the US leader: Donald Trump, if youre watching, first of all: Youre a bad president. Please resign.
Constitutional law expert Laurence Tribe argued even before the latest explosive reports that sufficient evidence had accrued since Trump took office in January to merit launching an impeachment investigation.
The country is faced with a president whose conduct strongly suggests that he poses a danger to our system of government, he wrote in the Washington Post at the weekend.

Urgent action needed to stop destruction of Asias forests - FAO
The destruction of forests in many Asian countries continues apace, raising fears that one of the worlds key Sustainable Development Goals may not be achievedby the 2030 deadline, the UNs Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) warned today.
When the SDGs were formulated and agreed by 193 countries in 2015, forests were explicitly mentioned in order that they be aided through the protection, restoration and promotion of sustainable forests while halting and reversingassociated land degradation and the loss of biodiversity.
While forests are critical to achieving the SDGs, they continue to be degraded and lost at a rate of 3.3 million hectares per year, said Patrick Durst, Senior Forestry Officer at the FAO Regional Office for Asia and the Pacific. In this region, forests continue to be converted to agriculture, destroyed and replaced by man-made infrastructure, housing, mining, and other land uses. Forest fires also continue to pose a threat to the region.
Covering one-third of the earths surface, forests provide an invaluable variety of social, economic and environmental benefits. Forests and trees sustain and protect all life in invaluable ways. They provide the clean air that we breathe and the water that we drink. Home to more than 80 percent of land animals and plants, forests safeguard the planets biodiversity and act as our natural defence against climate change. A third of the worlds biggest cities, including Mumbai, Bogot and New York, obtain much of their drinking water directly from forested areas. In short, life on earth is made possible and sustainable thanks to forests and trees.
Forests and poverty reduction
Forests also play a major role in supporting human livelihoods. SDG 1 is about ending poverty and forests have a lot to contribute, said Nina Brandstrup, FAO Representative in Sri Lanka. Globally, 1.3 billion people, mostly in developing countries, are estimated to be forest peoples, who depend on forests for their livelihoods and income. Twenty-eight percent of the total income of households living in or near forests come from forest and environmental income. Ending poverty (SDG 1) would need to take the health of our forests into account and engage those forest peoples directly.
According to FAOs Global Forest Resource Assessment in 2015, forests continue to be lost in many countries of the Asia-Pacific region, including Sri Lanka, that loses 6.6 thousand ha annually. Degradation of forest quality further decreases the forests capacity to provide goods and services necessary for human survival. These losses will be more acutely felt as the demand for forest products steadily rises in the future.
Countries are taking action
While most countries in the Asia-Pacific region continue to struggle in their responses to forest loss, some are taking positive action. China and Viet Nam have established impressive reforestation programmes and are actually increasing the amount of forested land.
Meantime, theGovernment of Sri Lanka has announced plans to increase the countrys forest cover by as much as 35 percent - and to do so inclusively with the people that will benefit most.
To reach our target, it is essential to address poverty as it is one of the major drivers of deforestation and forest degradation,said Anura Sathurusinghe, Conservator General of Forests and Head of the Sri Lanka Forest Department. We engage people in policy processes through discussions to solicit their valuable inputs and recommendations, he added.
Focusing on SDGs and poverty reduction, the Government of Sri Lanka and FAO are organizing the Tenth Executive Forest Policy Course for forestry leaders in the Asia-Pacific region. Twenty-four forestry leaders, with a near gender-balance (11 women), from 15 countries are participating in the course, with the theme Revisiting the poverty alleviation agenda in the context of SDGs: opportunities and challenges for Asia-Pacific forestry.
While few in number, these 24 senior participants are primarily senior officials dealing with land use and forestry policies in their countries. They are joined by well-known experts and resource persons in the fieldand, together,will deliberate on future challenges and policies that will be required to enhance the role of forests in poverty reduction and to meet the objectives of the SDGs.
The course is jointly organized by FAO, the Asia-Pacific Forest Policy Think Tank, the Forest Department of Ministry of Mahaweli Development and Environment of Sri Lanka and APAFRI.

WARM HOMES IN COLD CLIMATE
Today ArchWorld takes you out of the tropics and into a colder climate. Arch World talks to Archt. Priyan Hettipathirana on how architecture is practised in those distant lands so different from Sri Lanka. Hettipathirana who lived in London for a year with his family has a unique perspective on how architecture is practised there.
Architecture there was approached differently as the buildings are built, responding to a completely different environment. The Architecture in these regions responded to a cooler and temperate local environment. European countries are falling in the temperate and cool climate regions in the world. These countries are seasonal and they experience spring, summer, autumn and winter. The temperature in these countries can be low from 15 to 20 degrees and the humidity levels are also very low. The temperature can get even very much lower than this in winter. Due to the low humidity and temperature the need for cross ventilation does not arise because the cold wind can be very uncomfortable and can even be dreadful. The Europeans experience less sun during the year. They depend more on heat and for this European Architecture will admit the heat of the Sun into their houses through large windows as this will also bring natural light, said Hettipathirana.
Earths temperature
Sustainable Architecture is a widely spoken topic today as a result of global warming. So it is important to understand the connection between Sustainable architecture and Global warming.
In the last 100 years the Earths temperature has increased by 1 degree Celsius and the sea level has increased by 130 mm. In the next 100 years the prediction for the increase in temperature rise is 2 to 5 degrees Celsius and the increase in the sea level is 130 to 750 mm.
Global warming is a result of Greenhouse gases like CO2 emitted to the atmosphere by burning fossil fuels to generate energy. The Construction industry contributes to more 50% of the CO2 emissions. Therefore, buildings have to be designed by architects, to reduce its energy usage to help sustain the environment.
Sustainable architecture in the cool and moderate climates has contributed towards becoming low energy buildings. This is by way of reducing the need to heat buildings by directing the heat of the sun into the building through larger windows which faces the sun directly. The temperature can be increased to a more comfortable level by natural means and not using electricity. This is known as passive heating. The architectural details in temperate climates are focused on insulating the buildings to heat up inside the space. For this double glazing is mostly used. The architecture also features glass skylights that will bring natural light and heat to the interior, explained Hettipathirana
Well-heated spaces
People living in the temperate regions adapt their behavior to cope up with the cold temperature by living inside well heated spaces. People in these regions like to stay close to windows facing the sun or warm objects that radiate heat which is quite opposite to the tropical hot humid countries where the inhabitant stay away from the sun or heated objects. Architecture using larger areas of glass has been used in many timeless creations in the cooler temperate regions. The modern contemporary architecture has many examples like the Gherkin building and the London City hall, great court at the city hall and the pyramid at Louvre museum to name a few main architectural attractions. These building are glass building that can trap the heat during winter by way of highly insulated window and wall joints. Many European countries have a very rich architectural history and still preserved to a very greater extent, pointed out Hettipathirana
In tropical warm humid climates the verandahs are used to create our door shaded spaces.
These spaces are comfortable to stay as they encourage cross ventilation. Architecturally verandahs act as an extension to the house. In a colder temperate climate the conservatory will resemble the verandah. The Conservatory has glass on all sides including the roof in most cases. It is kept closed and well insulated during colder winter seasons to gain and store the radiant solar heat, stated Hettipathirana Further the spaces in tropical countries are more effective if there is cross ventilation through it.
This can be done by having physical openings between spaces. This is quite the opposite in the colder temperate regions which have spaces more or less separated to encourage each compartment sealed to conserve the heat generated internally, said Hettipathirana.
Predominantly colder countries use less shading devices in its architecture.
Shading devices are mainly used in the tropical countries to block solar heat, this works totally in the opposite way in colder regions. Similarly walls in a building are less in the direction of the sun to allow more solar heat to in to the room. In colder countries glass is used in this direction, informed Hettipathirana.
Interior spaces
Colder temperate climates have lower levels of humidity as well. This does not encourage rapid fungal growth and increased levels of dust mites inside enclosed spaces.
The interior spaces of the houses use material like carpets and timber planks to reduce the cooler temperature. Fabrics and carpets can collect dust which can create stuffiness inside the space. As there is less sun light and fresh air in colder seasons the inhabitants have to regularly maintain and clean the spaces to avoid negative effects of dust and pollen, clarified Hettipathirana.
Architecture in cooler climates use glass for the exterior building.
This is to permit solar heat in to the buildings during day time. In addition to glass material, wooden panels, bricks, concrete and steel are also used in buildings. Most of the traditional houses use timber for the structure for the floor and stair cases when building multiple floors.
In temperate climates there is no need to use trees for shading against the heat of the sun right through the year. But in tropical countries a tree is so precious, as it gives shade right throughout the year. Trees also help to cut the glare and it enhances the natural beauty. Most importantly trees are preserved as it helps to maintain the natural CO2 cycle, explained Hettipathirana.
Inhabitants generally feel much happier and healthier when they can take control of their own comfort issues.
It is essential that the inhabitants feel comfortable in their working environments. Uncomfortable living environments can have an impact on performance like a feeling of annoyance. The architecture can solve these issues by the design strategies adopted, said Hettipathirana.
Energy is used for comfort in the buildings. Out of the 50% of CO2 emissions, 40% is used for operational energy. This is mainly for fossil powered space heating, hot water, lighting and ventilation. Occupied buildings also count for use of appliances. The balance 10% emission comes during the construction in manufacturing and transporting material.
The important question is what can architecture do in the building industry to lower the rate of CO2 emission When talking about the cooler temperate climates, measures such as controlled human intervention, higher insulation and air tightness, use of passive heating methods will help in this.
In the tropical countries this could be addressed by passive cooling and natural ventilation. Renewable energy sources like solar, wind and waste energy too can help reduce dependence on fossil fuel.
Passive w energy
Renewable energy too can assist in reducing CO2 and other greenhouse gas emissions. In 2014 more than half a million people around the world in more than 160 countries marched against climate change. Architecture can help in a large way to reduce the carbon foot print by way of passive heating and cooling - Natural means of ventilating buildings and proper detailing to insulate controlled environments. Passive solar energy can be used for direct space heating and cooling. Passive solar energy is received free. Solar power is clean and silent, elucidated Hettipathirana.
Green Architecture is based on the guidelines laid for reducing the carbon foot print in a building.
These guidelines are promoted so the design strategies adopted in the architecture would comply to the minimum standards of CO2 emissions of a building - per meter of floor area per year. This calculation is based on sealing and insulation properties of a building, the type and fuel of a heating system. Further targets are set to make sure that all new houses comply to achieve zero carbon emission focusing on saving fuel and energy, summed up Hettipathirana.

What Colombo looks like right now
Stormy weather has caused chaos in Colombo as vehicles stall and people run for cover from the rain and strong winds.
The Meteorological Department warned that fairly strong winds of upto 40-50 kmph could be expected over the island.
Showers or thundershowers will occur in the Western, Sabaragamuwa, Southern, Central and North-western province, it said, with fairly heavy falls (more than 50 mm) expected at some places.

World no.1 Kerber crashes out of Rome
Rome: World number one Angelique Kerber crashed out of the Rome Masters on Wednesday, the top seed beaten 6-4 6-0 in the second round by Anett Kontaveit of Estonia.
The Germans 56-minute knock out came two days after she was confirmed at the top of the WTA rankings, displacing Serena Williams after making it to the third round at last weeks Madrid Open. The defeat demonstrated more of the patchy and inconsistent form which the 29-year-old cannot seem to shake off since starting to duel with Williams at the top of the WTA listings last season.
She lost serve five times to join another drawcard at the Foro Italico Maris Sharapova on the sidelines. AFP
