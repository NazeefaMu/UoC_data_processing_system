SL begins infusing locally milled rice to markets
Sri Lanka had started infusing locally milled rice to markets and had also inked an agreement with Indian private suppliers for immediate rice tranches to Colombo.We are also going ahead with the Indian rice orders, said Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen on August 29. He said so during discussions with his top officials on the latest moves by his ministry on domestic rice supplies.
Under the direction of President Maithripala Sirisena, we released 52,000 MT of locally milled rice to the markets by last weekend, said Minister Bathiudeen, These rice stocks were milled from paddy from the Paddy Marketing Board. We are also going ahead with the Indian rice orders; they are giving us a very competitive price.
Accordingly, last Friday (25), the Ministry of Industry and Commerce and its Cooperative Wholesale Establishment (CWE) have, in a government-to-overseas private sector MoU, placed an order for the supply of 70,000 MT of Nadu rice to Sri Lanka.
This tranche is expected to land here in mid-September. Another MoU with Indian private sector for 30,000 MT of Samba rice is to be inked in Colombo anytime. This rice stock is expected to arrive during late September.
On July 31, the CWE, under Minister Bathiudeen, began pulling local paddy stocks for milling.
Under the orders of the Cost of Living Committee on July 26, the CWE started extracting 80,000 MT of paddy with the Paddy Marketing Boards warehouses to mill in the CWEs own mills, as well as through private millers.
CWE sources said that 52,000 MT of milled rice from these paddy stocks have already been delivered to Lanka Sathosa during last weekend to be sold to the public at the lowest possible price. The 52,000 MT tranche consists of a variety of rice types.
As a result of Indian purchases and domestic paddy milling, a total of 152,000 MT of rice is flooding the market-of which 52,000 MT is already in the markets at this moment.

SLSI standardises resources to ensure more products fall under certification
Sri Lanka Standard Institute (SLSI) has standardised their resources to ensure that more products fall under the necessary certifications, said Director General Gamini Dharmawardena.
He said that today both the consumer and manufacturer are looking for quality products. In some cases consumers compromise price for quality. This is a good sign as it would entice manufacturers to ensure higher qualityof their products.
SLSI provides training on standardization and quality management for personnel in the industry with a view to imparting the knowledge base required for producing good quality products and services.
SLSI covers training programes on Standardization and Quality Management, ISO 9000 Quality Management Systems, ISO 14000 Environment Management Systems and other quality related fields for all grades of industrial personnel; viz top management, middle management, executives, supervisors, technicians and shop floor workers.
As the national standards body in Sri Lanka, SLSI provides quality services at very competitive rates and is backed by its long service record of being in the certification, inspection and testing business for over 40 years. SLSI is supported by a large pool of technically competent, well qualified and experienced professionals.
With a total of about 50 lead auditors, mostly full-time, they can provide auditing services covering a wide range of economic activities.
Almost all these professionals are also well trained to be multi-skilled and thus are competent to carry out audits of integrated schemes. For example, an ISO 9000/ISO 14001/OHSAS 18001 covering product certification audits.
Likewise, the tests are conducted to national and international standards using up-to-date testing facilities operated by competent staff.
The SLS mark has been granted to factories based in China, India, Singapore, UAE, Malaysia, Pakistan and Indonesia and requests have been received by many other countries.
SLSI has noted that the demand for SLS has been increasing and SLSI is taking every effort to cater to the increasing trend worldwide for the need for food products to be certified for quality,
Meanwhile experts in the manufacture of steels request the SLSI to check inferior steel that is being used by some manufacturers to make steel billets to manufacture steel locally.
According to SLSI standards, a ton of steel should have 270 to 280 steel bars. However it is observers that in some cases there are about 300 steel bars clearly indicating that bars are not up to the required weight and thickness. Similarly a steel rod should be in 6 metres in length but here are instances where the length is sometimes 5.5 to 5.8 metres in length.
These should be tested before going to construction sites. In the area of reinforcement steel, the quality is not maintained by some. The weights of the steel per ton too should be checked. There are instances where the steel rod thinness is low and even the length is shorter than the industry stipulation.
It was also pointed out that while some steel manufacturers are adhering to strict quality controls some are acting in an irresponsible manner.
Some even evade import tax by adopting unethical practices and this is mostly done by foreign companies based in Sri Lanka. This also happens by steel sellers who import steel from India and the SLSI should come up with a system to check this which is a major threat to the construction industry.
SLSI was established in 1964 as the Bureau of Ceylon Standards (BCS) by an Act of Parliament to function as the National Standards Body and to provide for matters connected therewith or incidental thereto In 1969, BCS was admitted as a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO). SLSI is a member of the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) which is based in Geneva. (VW)

SriLankan can still be turned around - ceo Ratwatte
SriLankan Airlines can still be turned around and be run locally, provided the huge debt burden is cleared and the government implements the restricting plan.
In an interview with Daily News the CEO of SriLankan Suren Ratwatte said that in the last three months their revenue targets were met and there were operational profits.
However these profits are being swallowed by the huge debt pay back which is keeping the airline in red.
It may be difficult for the government to clear this debt and the airline needs a partner to pump in money and work alongside with them, Ratwatte said.
He said that they had presented a comprehensive restricting plan to the government but lamented that it was not being implemented.
This plan is very practical and if and when its implemented the airline can fly to a better financial position,he said.
Commenting on the new Neo narrow bodied aircraft he said that they give the national carrier a huge saving on fuel and was a good investment and the move to introduce the Australian flight to operate daily from October is turning out to be a very good move as they have a huge demand for it.
We also see a demand from both student and other passengers as well as from the region who now has to fly longer to reach Australia.
With SriLankan their flight times and cost is very much less.
To make this service more beneficial we have also adjusted some of our regional route timing giving the transit passenger an almost immediate connection.
In addition we have also increased new destinations to India and have added frequency to Mumbai to correspond to the timing of the Australian flight,he said.
Ratwatte commenting on the global airlines said that airlines like Singapore Airlines, Emirates, Etihad, Cathy and several others are not making profits. Even budget airlines like Air Asia is bleeding. He attributed this to high operational costs and intense competition. However in contrast European an US budget airlines are making profits but once again not on regional routes,he added.

Dialogue on lessons learnt  2017
Provincial Councils and Local Government Minister Faiszer Musthapha said, he strongly believes corruption can be minimized if womens participation in Sri Lankan politics can be increased.
He was speaking at the progress review meeting on the North Eastern Local Services Improvement project (NELSIP) which was implemented under his Ministry for Provincial Councils and Local Government.
The review meeting, held under the theme Dialogue on lessons learnt  2017, was attended by representatives from the World Bank, the Australian High Commission, members of Local Authorities in relevant areas, and representatives from the construction companies attended this event.
The most recognized barrier for the development of our country is corruption. If we could increase womens participation in Sri Lankan politics, I believe that we will be able to control this issue, he said.
The minister went on to say that fraud and corruption in institutions under the administration of women is comparatively lesser.
Speaking further at the event at Aliya Resort, Habarana, Minister Musthapha said, We know that women have played a great role in the history of our country. They are intelligent. But during the past era, we couldnt see much engagement of women in social activities, especially in politics. Compared to other countries, theres a huge difference in womens representation in politics in Sri Lanka. As I believe, the percentage of womens participation in politics must be higher than this, especially as our country is a developing one, he added.
This programme was held for two days and the participants made discussions about implementing new programmes to achieve their new goals in development scheme.
The objective of this progress review meeting was to look into the services delivered in respective areas and to identify issues faced during the implementation of this project and to discuss the ways in which to overcome them.

Lankan hotel industry to provide over 150, 000 new jobs by 2020
Sri Lankan hotel industry would provide over 150, 000 new employment opportunities by 2020 said Sunil Dissanayake, Chairman Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism & Hotel Management.
He said that these opportunities have been mostly created by openings coming up in new star class hotels that would be opening in the next two years including Shangri La, Hyatt and several other hotels.
The demand is huge and we need more international hotel schools to open in Sri Lanka and offer high quality education to youth. The Board of Investment should play the lead role in this regard.
He however was disappointed that the local hotel sector decision makers were not doing enough and were not keen to put the extra mile and woo hotel staff working overseas. I am not referring to top level staff but the mid-level employees who are working overseas and almost drawing the same salary if they worked in Sri Lanka.
Local hotels decision makers should conduct awareness programs especially in the gulf and updated the current positive statues of Sri Lankan hotel sector and the high paying jobs that are on offer.
From the point of view of employees its practical for them to work overseas for about two years and come back to Sri Lanka since they could have a better life with their families.
He also lashed out to some of the five star hotels for recruiting foreign staff to decision making level since Sri Lankans can fill that void better Also we see some star class hotels retiring local staff as soon as they reach 55 and then employ foreign staff without going for extension.

No positive relief for prevailing drought conditions
The distribution of dry food ration and the drinking water to the drought-hit farmer families in the Anuradhapura District has been in progress. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake told the Daily News that although there were some intermittent rains in certain areas in the district, there was no positive relief for the prevailing drought conditions. He said that there were 157,500 farmer families victimized as a result of the existing severe drought.
"I believe that the first phase of the dry food ration distribution programme could be completed within next few days up to now out of the 694 Grama Niladhari Divisions, drought-hit families amounting to 100,160 families in nearly 500 Grama Niladhari Divisions have been offered dry food rations worth Rs. 2,500 each.
The Government agent said that those who had been overlooked during the distribution food rations shall be brought to his notice or to the notice of the Divisional Secretaries or the Grama Niladharis.
The government agent said further that for the completion of the first phase of the food distribution, the Government had allocated Rs. 200 million. For the implementation of the second phase, where the other half of the dry food rations worth Rs. 2,500 is to be distributed, an additional sum of Rs. 363 million would be allocated. He further said that for the one month's dry food ration worth Rs. 5,000 per family, a sum of Rs. 560 million is required.
In the meantime, the distribution of drinking water through the water bowsers where drinking water is scarce has been continuing, according to the Government agent. He said that due to the recent rainfall, the distribution of water to certain areas had been suspended temporarily.
At present, 25,000 families in 15 Divisional Secretary Divisions in the district are being provided with drinking water. It was learnt that the water level of the Nuwarawewa reservoir, which is the main drinking water supply source in Anuradhapura, has been coming down rapidly. The present capacity of the Nuwarawewa is limited to 5,800 acre feet, whereas the general capacity of the tank is 36,050 acre feet. The requests by the Anuradhapura Government agent, Water Supply Board and irrigation authorities, for releasing a Mahaweli water turn of 5,000 acre feet via Nachchaduwa tank, has not been positively responded to so far by the Mahaweli Authority.

BASC must respect dissent: CaFfE
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASC) must respect the right of citizens to question and criticise the Judicial Service, Campaign for Free and Fair Elections (CaFFE) Executive Director Ranjith Keerthi Tennakoon said in a release.
BASL Chairman UR de Silva said they will take legal action against MP Ranjan Ramanayake in the coming week for stating that attorneys are corrupt.
The release adds: "In any profession, there are clean and professional people as well as corrupt practitioners. The same applies to the judicial service. Citizens have the right to criticise judges and attorneys, as they have the right to be critical of any other profession. There should be the freedom to do so and those being criticised must have the discipline to tolerate criticism.
"MP Ramanayake's criticisms are nothing new. They have been levelled against judges and attorneys by civil society activists and journalists. Such criticisms have been discussed by attorneys and the judicial services commission."
"Ravaya former editor Victor Ivan revealed the activities of Judge Lenin Ratnayake which shocked and surprised many. The behaviour of justice Abeyratne was equally shocking. The revelations on former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva by Victor Ivan would have led to a clean-up of the judicial service in a country that has a civilized, democratic and transparent governance.
"President Maithripala Sirisena revealed that former Chief Justice Mohan Peiris told him that he is willing to give verdicts that favour the government, if he was allowed to remain in his post. The Centre for Human Rights (CHR) complained to the Judicial Service Commission about the appointment of DMI Dissanayake who received an appointment as a magistrate. After considering our appeal, the Commission decided not to give him the permanent appointment. The Anti-Corruption Front lodged a complaint about the elephant theft allegations against magistrate Thilina Gamage. The manner in which he was granted bail was controversial. Now, he has been suspended. Similar allegations were levelled against district judges, Somaratne and Aravinda Perera. The Commission has taken action on them. The reputation of the court was also damaged due to a series of allegations, including charges of sexual harassment against Justice Sarath de Abrew, who committed suicide."

Bribery commission seeks more teeth
The archaic anti-graft legislation has hindered the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption (CIABOC) from executing its powers to the full despite the Commission received more teeth through the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday CAIBOC Director General Sarath Jayamanne PC said the CIABOC Act and Declaration of Assets and Liabilities law must be updated if the Commission is to make use of its new found powers under the 19th Amendment.
The 19th Amendment gave the CIABOC the authority to investigate into an allegations of bribery or corruption by its own motion even in the absence of a complaint filed to it. Despite two years since the passing of the 19th Amendment in Parliament, the Daily News learns that the number of investigations the Commission initiated by its own motion stood at zero.
Director General Jayamanne told Daily News that his Commission is unable to put the provision into practice due to existing legal barriers and lack of infrastructure. This provision is conceptually good. It has stemmed from similar powers vested in anti-graft bodies in other countries. However, in those countries there are specialized intelligence units operating all over the country. The anti-graft body is filtered with information provided by those intelligence officers engaging in undercover operations.
We do not have such a system here. If we are to initiate an investigation by our own, we need witnesses and evidence. If not, our decisions could be challenged in court stating that we started an investigation without a base. Simultaneous with the law we have to develop other infrastructure also, he said.
Jayamanne noted that the CIABOC Act, which has not been updated for over two decades, still says that there must be a complaint if the Commission is to initiate an investigation.
Simultaneous with the Constitution, the bribery act and the law pertaining to declaration of assets must be revised, he added.
There are major issues in our Act and we are contemplating on amending it. It is very sad that not a single word in the Act has been changed for the last 21 years, said Jayamanne adding that he would meet the Legal Draftsman on Thursday to discuss on preparing a working draft.
Jayamanne also pointed out that the CIABOC, as per the existing law, has no authority to investigate into money laundering, despite it being a major offence related to corruption.
We can only investigate into allegations of bribery, assets and corruption.However, our investigations into corruption often leads to instances of money laundering.The FCID and CID have such powers, but the secrecy clause in our Act prevents us from sharing that information with them. Changing the law is necessary to enable us to share our information with relevant other law enforcement bodies, he remarked.
Briefing on the progress of investigations of the Commission, the Director General said it has brought down the number of pending cases from 10,000 to 4,050 during the last two years. We have received 1,750 complaints so far this year and out of them we have already finished 800. In most of the cases, we concluded that there is not enough material to prove the charges. Some cases were referred to other Government Departments for various other actions and there were instances where we asked for reports from the relevant institution, he stated.
Last year we received 3,450 complaints and this figure was 3,964 in 2015. Such is the case load we are grappling with. We have to maximise our strength in order to investigate into them with the existing limited staff and resources. Among these are major cases such as the Avant Garde. We cannot forget the minor cases too. It is a matter of striking a balance he added.
Jayamanne said the Commission filed 24 cases in the Magistrate court and 26 cases in the high court this year following the completion of investigations. In addition to them, we have done 26 successful raids for the last eight months and arrested 32 persons he commented.
Asked as to how many persons had been prosecuted after completing the investigations, he said 8 cases had been concluded in the Magistrate Court while another 32 cases had been concluded in the High Court. The disposal in the courts does not exclusively depend on us. It is up to the judges, he remarked. Pointing to the shortage of staff, the Director General said 200 graduates will be recruited shortly, adding that a new unit titled Prevention Unit will be set up with 50 of those new recruits. The Unit will assess how the Government institutions are functioning and guide them to strengthen their procedure to prevent corruption, he noted.

The Public Administration and Management Ministry has issued a circular over an amendment concerning the appointment letters made to the public service since January 1, 2016, over their pensions scheme.
The Ministry pointed out that as the budget proposal for 2016 had pledged to introduce a new pensions scheme for the public servants, the circular had it that the pensions scheme for the public servants appointed since 2016 would be changed in future according to the Government policy in that respect.
However, the Ministry pointed out that the Government had not so far reached its policy over the pension scheme for the newly appointed members of the public service.
The Cabinet of Ministers had approved on August 15 that until the government reaches a policy decision, Clause Six of the members of the public service appointed since January 1, 2016 should be amended as that they would be bound by the policy decision that is to be taken in future. It also said that the new entrants are entitled to a pension and they have to make their contributions to the pension and the Widows' and Orphans' Pension Fund.
The Ministry had made this amendment with the approval of the Public Service Commission.

Colombos clean glory re-established: Minister Ranawaka
Colombo has been transformed into one of the cleanest cities in Asia with tons of man-made waste turning into organic fertilizer, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
The minister said the Western Development Ministry working together with the Colombo Municipal Council and surrounding Councils, the Land Reclamation Ministry and other relevant institutions, have put an end to the citys prolonged practice of disposing garbage into water channels, soil systems and paddy fields, introducing scientific waste management methods.
We transformed Colombo into a clean haven not by force or by intimidation or by way of using white van or by deploying military personnel in every corner, but through dedication on the part of every one and by working together, Ranawaka said. Thanking Municipal Commissioners, Public Health Inspectors, the Police, the line ministries, engineers of waste management units, the media, the local governments, the provincial authorities, provincial ministers, the Navy and Army officers for their dedication and support extended in achieving a clean Colombo, Reawake said mountains of garbage which had become a hazard to the city is being turned into organic fertilizer.
More than 400 tons of organic fertilizer are produced from the waste collected in Colombo and the suburbs under Mihijaya Fertilizer Project carried out by the Megapolis and Western Development Ministry together with the Sri Lanka Land Reclamation Ministry, the minister said after announcing the launching of Mihijaya Project at the Colombo Town Hall.
He said it will be a duty of everyone to support Mihijaya for it will be one of the landmark waste management programmes in Sri Lanka to address waste problems on a sustainable footing.
We have adopted a method of disposing mountains of human waste into our soil systems, water channels and the sea in Colombo and the surrounding regions, he said. This has been a destructive method of waste disposal, he said.
There is no point in blaming governments or politicians on this account because every time the political system or the authorities tried to solve the issue, they were prevented by a rising tide of protest campaigns and numerous political distractions, Ranawaka said.

Dayasiri and Arjuna lock horns at Cabinet meeting
As the fortunes of Sri Lanka Cricket stumble into new lows, a heated exchange took place between Sports Minister Dayasiri Jayasekara and Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga at the weekly Cabinet meeting held yesterday morning.
The Sports Minister had berated the former cricket captain for demoralising the team with his comments.
Ranatunga addressing the media on Monday had criticised the Sports Minister for having accepted the nomination of Thilanga Sumathipala to contest for the post of President at the Sri Lanka Cricket Board elections. He blamed the the cricket administration for recent spate of defeats.
The Petroleum Resource Development Minister who has been a strong critic in matters of cricket has also written to President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to put an end to the destruction of cricket and to change the present cricket administration into an interim committee or commission. Ranatunga who contested for the post of the Vice President, lost to Sumathipalas team at the election. Since then he has alleged that the election was rigged.
Minister Jayasekara had observed in the Cabinet that the constant remarks by Ranatunga simply added to the confusion and was detrimental to the cricketers who have been under great pressure to perform.
The minister at last weeks Cabinet media briefing noted that the ministry planned a workshop for all those who are involved in cricket to come and discuss the future of Sri Lanka Cricket in a constructive manner and to formulate a plan of action instead of pursuing their own personal vendettas.

Former UNP General Secretary Tissa Attanayake said the period his stars were in transit is slowly coming to an end. He said he would not describe the removal of Dr. Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe from his ministerial positions as a right decision.
He could have been retained after getting him to correct his wrongs. The UNP and the Government as a whole had been inconvenienced due to this development which may even lead to a political upheaval, he added.
He was addressing the gathering at a ceremony held at the Sri Weluvanarama Saddhatissa Pirivena to commemorate the 10th death anniversary of its former Parivenadhipati Ven. Karamada Ariyatissa Thera, recently. Attanayake said Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe had rendered a great service in support of UNP leader Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and party supporters since 2007. Attanayake added, in his capacity as UNP General Secretary, his sole endeavour was to bring a UNP government into power as it was relegated to the opposition for 23 years.
Today, nearly 60,000 UNP supporters who had suffered political victimisation by past governments were still lingering without any form of compensation as the Government had failed to fulfil their expectations.
The most important thing the UNP ought to do today was to build a strong leadership which could face the Presidential Election in 2019.
UNP supporters were still suffering because the party had failed to form a government of its own so far.
He said the Government had today forgotten the rural masses which supported it. Attanayake said he will enter politics once again at the tune of a future national election. Nutrition food packs and equipment were distributed among a group of 100 expectant mothers at this ceremony.

Euro rises to 18-month high against dollar
The euro has hit $1.20 for the first time since January 2015 as the prospect of a US interest rate rise recedes.
Hurricane Harveys impact has led analysts to assume the US central bank will not want to risk curbing economic growth and fears over North Koreas activities have unnerved investors.
A rise in interest rates tends to draw investors to a currency, taking advantage of the higher returns.Meanwhile, the euro has itself been gaining against a range of currencies.
Against the dollar, it has risen by almost 15% so far this year.
The euro has strengthened in recent months, as the eurozones economy improves and markets predict the European Central Bank could start to cut back the money-printing programme it has been running to repair the ravages of the eurozone crisis and credit crunch of the late 2000s.
The dollar was also undermined by Fridays annual meeting of central bankers at the Jackson Hole resort in Wyoming.

Fitch affirms Citibank N.A. - Colombo Branch at AAA(lka); Outlook stable
Fitch Ratings Lanka has affirmed Citibank N.A. - Colombo Branchs (CitiSL) National Long-Term Rating at AAA(lka). The outlook is stable.
CitiSLs rating reflects the credit profile and financial strength of Citibank, N.A. (Long-Term Issuer Default Rating (IDR) at A+/Stable and Viability Rating at a). The rating is linked with Citibank, N.A.s IDR to reflect CitiSLs legal status as a branch of Citibank, N.A., which makes it part of the same legal entity.
It also reflects the relatively small size of the branch (less than 1% of the total assets of Citibank, N.A.) and therefore, any support would not be material to the head office. Citibank, N.A. s rating is higher than Sri Lankas Long-Term Local- and Foreign-Currency IDRs of B+/Stable and as a result, CitiSLs rating is at the highest end of the National Rating scale for Sri Lanka.
Fitch believes that support from Citibank, N.A. would be forthcoming if required, subject to any regulatory constraints on remitting money into Sri Lanka.
CitiSL is operationally integrated with Citigroup through the use of common systems and regular reporting. Its strategic objectives are also aligned with those of the group. CitiSLs stringent credit evaluation framework has helped the branch to maintain sound asset quality with zero non-performing loans since 2009. However, it has also led to a highly concentrated loan book, with the top 20 largest loans accounting for 97% of total lending at end-1H17.
Fitch expects the branch to maintain sufficient capitalisation to support its business plans despite regular profit repatriations. CitiSLs Fitch Core Capital ratio remained high at 34.6% at end-June 2017, although it declined from the 44.5% at end-2016 due to aggressive loan growth in 1H17.
CitiSLs highly concentrated deposit base declined to 76.3% of the branchs funding mix at end-1H17 from 85.6% at end-2015, due to an increase in inter-branch borrowings. However, Fitch believes that CitiSLs liquidity position is stable as the branch has access to intergroup funding, if needed.

President Maithripala Sirsena today assured that he would run the government until 2020, irrespective of who walks in or walks out.
Addressing a breakfast meeting with newspaper editors and media heads at the Presidential Secretariat in Colombo today, the President said he was confident that the unity government would continue until 2020, in accordance with the mandate he received at the Presidential Election in January, 2015.
Look at the composition of the current Parliament! The UNP has 106 seats and the UPFA has 95 seats. No one has a simple majority to form a government on their own. Any government, under the current circumstances, has to be a coalition government, the President said, while adding that the Central Committee of the SLFP will make a final decision in December on renewing the Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the UNP.
However, I am confident that the current government will continue until 2020. If not, there has to be some coup or conspiracy! the President stressed.
Commenting on attempts to create divisions in the SLFP, the President said only the SLFP would sustain as a political entity.
Only the SLFP has a vision and a policy framework. The party is guided by them. Political parties with individual agendas cannot function in the long run, the President said, adding that the SLFP will become an even stronger political party in the future.

Heal those who bear the scars of war: Foreign Ministry Secretary
Foreign Ministry Secretary Prasad Kariyawasam yesterday stressed the need to heal our own who bear the scars of war both mental and physical as a preventive measure to counter violent extremism.
Kariyawasam who delivered the concluding remarks at the final day of the 2017 Defence Seminar at the BMICH added that while the bombs were silent, societies were fragile and communities were vulnerable to external influences.
The government alone cannot undertake this task and there needs to be dedication from each individual from every level of society," he said speaking on the Seminars theme of Countering Violent Extremism: Global Trends.
As he lent prominence to methods of preventing extremism, the secretary stressed the need to take a fresh look at education. As a result, the government is expected to roll out a new education programme called Think Equal for preschools in the country to change Mindsets and attitudes through value based education and emphasis on social learning.
As the seminar touched on ways in which individuals become radialised, the Foreign Secretary said it was important that those who have given up violence be treated with sensitivity and without intimidation.
He said there should be capacity building measures for civil society groups so that the citizens are offered an alternative to voice for their concerns rather than resorting to violence.
Kariyawasam said women should be empowered with special assistance extended to women-headed households as women play an important role in preventing violent extremism.
There needs to be trust built at all levels of the government and in law enforcement, including security forces which are meant to protect the people. Political grievances must be addressed as these are breeding grounds for extremists. We need a functioning and credible democracy with an independent judiciary, law enforcement officers who respect human rights and freedom of speech and religion," he said.
Security forces are often called upon to counter when societies fail to prevent terrorism casting a big burden on security forces. They have to be mindful in carrying out their duty. They have the burden of making sure that their actions dont exacerbate the situation," he said.

Mayhem at Southern Province meeting, Governors directive ignored
The special council meeting convened by the Central Provincial Council to adopt the draft 20th Amendment to the Constitution was held contravening the directives of the Southern Province Governor.
Earlier, Southern Province Governor Hemakumara Nanayakkara had summoned the meeting.
However, the Governor had sent a subsequent directive to Council Chairman K. A. Somawansa requesting him to postpone the same to August 12 as the proposed bill was to be amended.
At the outset of the meeting Chairman informed the house about the Governors directive to call off the meeting to which the Joint Opposition loyalists of the ruling United National Freedom Alliance (UPFA) vehemently protested demanding the meeting be held as scheduled.
Then Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal De Silva told the house that the Governor is constitutionally empowered to postpone any meeting or even a session of the council under executive powers delegated to him as Presidents representative.The Chairman has to act according to the governors orders, the Chief Minister observed.
Then Joint Opposition loyalists proposed to take a vote of councillors whether to carryout orders of the governors second directive requesting the postponement of the council.
Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also pointed out that the council has no right to take a vote on whether to implement governors orders to suspend the meeting. According to the Constitution the governor has the authority to send such directives. So we demand to carry out the governors orders.
At this stage councillors began creating a scene making allegations. Joint Opposition loyalists forced the Chairman not to postpone the meeting on governors instructions while opposition members including a section of the ruling party demanded to carry out the governors orders.
The house turned boisterous and unruly and the chairman postponed the meeting for 15 minutes.
As the House resumed after 15 minutes the Chairman delivered his verdict over the issue.
I have to carry out the orders of the governor and respect both the President and Governor. However I have to listen to the majority of the peoples representative of the council.
So I decide to take a vote on the draft 20th Amendment to Constitution referred to me by the governor previously as formerly scheduled. I am also prepared to take up the amended bill also for discussion once it is duly sent to me by the governor, the Chairman said delivering his decision.
The Chief Minister who commented on the chairmans verdict said that it was completely unlawful and unethical and it provided a very adverse constitutional illustration for the future.
As the meeting is going to be held in an illegal manner we cannot take part in such an unlawful assembly.So we walk out of the House, the Chief Minister declared.
The Opposition Leader Tennakoon Nilame also made a similar statement and walked out of the chamber with his group.
As the Chairman was to continue the meeting without the participation opposition and some of the ruling party an opposition member abruptly took the Maze and ran out of the chamber creating a fanatical drama.
The Joint opposition loyalists ran after him and grabbed the Maize from him and brought back to the chamber.
However the Chairman held the meeting amidst pandemonium and obstruction of the members. Finally he took a vote over the draft of the proposed bill. All 27 Joint Opposition loyalists who were present voted against the draft bill while UNP councillor T.K.Gamini who was present in the chamber abstained. Acccordingly the draft of the 20th Amendment to the Constitution was defeated by 27 votes.
The JVP Councillors were not present at the yesterdays council meeting.

New water filter to be the solution
The Health Ministry, in league with B. R. J. W. Enterprises, is conducting research on the possibility of utilising a water filter machine introduced by a British firm to resolve the acute water scarcity problem in Sri Lanka and combat the kidney disease fast-spreading in Raja Rata and several other parts of the country.
B. R. J. W. Enterprises Director Darren Weerasinghe said successful test runs carried out in Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Medirigiriya, Dehiattakandiya, Mahiyangana and several other areas have proved that this water filter can be provided to these areas for use for the consumption of safe drinking water.
The filter had been successfully used in several other countries facing acute water problems, including Afghanistan. They had decided to introduce in Sri Lanka too, as a gesture of supporting President Maithripala Sirisena's sincere efforts to combat the kidney disease spreading in the NCP. Before introducing the filter, they met President Maithripala Sirisena and held a practical demonstration of the filter and the President was amazed about its working which helped to turn contaminated water into pure drinking water in a moment.
This water filter produced by Life Saver Company had been imported from Britain.
No financial burden is involved in operating this filter machine which can purify 18.5 litres of water at a given time. One filter can serve about 10 familities as it does not involve any electronic operation. Only the filter has to be changed after purification of 20,000 litres. Using this filter machine is more economical when considering the massive Rs. 124 billion spent annually by the Government to provide pure drinking water to the people.
The British firm Life Saver Company had already introduced this machine to Afghanistan and the Arab world.
A family of four may have to spend a meagre 50 cents per day for using this machine as no fuel or electricity is needed for its operation.
Regional Manager of the Life Saver Company Stewert Ellson said it is being planned to supply this filter machine to people free of charge or at a nominal subsidised price.

North Korea: 'Japan missile was first step in Pacific operation'

North Korea says its firing of a missile over Japan was "the first step" of military operations in the Pacific, signalling plans for more launches.
State media also repeated threats to the US Pacific island of Guam, which it called "an advanced base of invasion".
The missilelaunched on Tuesdaycrossed Japan's northern Hokkaido island, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea.
The UN Security Council has unanimously condemned North Korea for its actions.
Meeting late on Tuesday in New York, the council called the launch "outrageous", demanding North Korea cease all missile testing.
Whilethe statementsaid the regime's actions were a threat to all UN member states, it did not threaten new sanctions against Pyongyang.
Russia and China said US military activity in the region was partly to blame for the increase in tensions, and urged negotiations.
North Korea has repeatedly conducted missile launches in recent months, despite being barred from doing so under UN rules.
The latest, a domestically made Hwasong-12, was launched early on Tuesday Korean time from a site near Pyongyang.
It travelled some 2,700km (1,678 miles), at an unusually low height for North Korean missile tests, over Hokkaido before crashing about 1,180km off Japan's eastern coast.
Japan sent out alerts telling people in Hokkaido to take cover. Prime Minister Shinzo Abe later called it "unprecedented, serious and a grave threat".
For the first time, North Korea's official news agency KCNA admitted deliberately firing a ballistic missile across Japan. Previous projectiles which crossed the mainland were later claimed to have been satellite launches.
It said the launch was in direct response to joint US-South Korean military drills which are currently taking place, as well as to mark the anniversary of the Japan-Korea treaty of 1910, which saw Japanese forces annex the Korean peninsula.
KCNA, quoting leader Kim Jong-un, said that, "like a real war", the latest drill was "the first step of the military operation of the KPA [Korean People's Army] in the Pacific and a meaningful prelude to containing Guam".
Kim has also ordered more rocket drills targeting the region, it said.
North Korea first threatenedto fire missiles towards Guam- a major US military centre in the Pacific and where some 160,000 US citizens live - earlier this month.
US officials had suggested that the fact it had not carried out its threat so far was a sign of possible progress.
US President Donald Trump, in a statement released by the White House, said the world had "received North Korea's latest message loud and clear".
"This regime has signalled its contempt for its neighbours, for all members of the United Nations, and for minimum standards of acceptable international behaviour," he said.
"Threatening and destabilising actions only increase the North Korean regime's isolation in the region and among all nations of the world. All options are on the table."
Earlier this month, President Trumpwarned Pyongyang would face "fire and fury"if it continued to threaten the US.
North Korea's missile programme:
North Korea has been working on its missile programme for decades, with weapons based on the Soviet-developed Scud
It has conducted short- and medium-range tests on many occasions, sometimes to mark domestic events or at times of regional tension
In recent months the pace of testing has increased; experts say North Korea appears to be making significant advances towards its goal of building a reliable long-range nuclear-capable weapon
In July, North Korea launched two missiles which it said were Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting the US; experts believe they put parts of the US in range
There is no consensus on how close North Korea is to miniaturising a nuclear warhead to put on a missile

The Centre for Indo-Lanka Initiatives at Pathfinder Foundation (PF) and National Maritime Foundation (NMF) based in New Delhi, India signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on to enhance bilateral cooperation between the two think-tank organizations engaged in academic research.
The scope of this MoU is to embark on research activities on subject areas of maritime strategy and security studies. The two research institutes will collaborate in conducting joint seminars, conferences, symposia and workshops to enhance knowledge, sharing experiences and best practices of relevant stakeholders in both countries.
The PF and the NMF will also jointly publish journal articles and research papers on mutually agreed subjects, and have reciprocal exchange of visits by officials and researchers for discussions, seminars and conferences.
Admiral Dr. Jayanath Colombage (Retd.), the Director of Center for Indo-Lanka Initiatives at Pathfinder Foundation and Vice Admiral Pradeep Chauhan (Retd.), the Director of NMF signed the MoU on behalf of their respective organisations.
The Indian Ocean has become the key ocean for energy, trade and food security in the 21st Century. There is a major world economic shift taking place upon the waters of this ocean as Asian Powers are emerging as new economic powers. The rise of China to number two position and India to number seven position in the world economic order in GDP terms is a clear example of this economic shift. The Indian subcontinent is positioned at the centre of this most important ocean in this century. India, with a nearly 7,500 kilometres of coastline, the fastest developing economy and the strongest military power in the region; and Sri Lanka, with its geostrategic location; both need to play a mutually-supporting role in maintaining freedom of navigation and ensuring the sustainable exploitation of resources in accordance with the concept of the Blue Economy. There is a rationale to engage in academic discussion on maritime security in the Indian Ocean with a view to develop a policy framework for the attention of policymakers in India and Sri Lanka.
The PF and NMF have planned to conduct their first bilateral conference in February 2018 focusing on developing a platform for analytical and innovative discussion on maritime security in the Indian Ocean. This conference will lay emphasis on non-traditional maritime security cooperation, including with regard to capacity building and capability enhancement.
Special emphasis will be paid on an assessment of the maritime security and safety risks from prevailing and projected threats, cooperative maritime security endeavours at the political, operational and local levels including Maritime Domain Awareness (MDA) and coordinated national positions at regional, multilateral forums such as the Indian Ocean Rim Association (IORA), the Indian Ocean Naval Symposium (IONS) and the Galle Dialogue.

PTL has tampered with call recordings says metropolitan
Perpetual Treasuries Limited (PTL) has tampered with telephone call recordings which they handed over to the Treasury Bond Commission, it was revealed yesterday.
The evidence was led through Metropolitan Communication Limited Chief Engineer Nalin Dharmaratne which installed the call logger system at the PTL in June 2015.
PTL CEO Kasun Palisena, who was testifying in the morning session at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry investigating into the Treasury bond issue, was ordered to get down from the witness box for a new witness to testify before the PCoI.
New witness Dharmaratne took to the witness box to give evidence proving that PTL has tampered with the call logger system while PTL CEO Palisena was requested to leave the court room.
Chief Engineer Dharmaratne informed the PCoI that PTL has reinstalled the call logger system and its back up. The Commissioners questioned Dharmaratne as to how he could prove such reinstallation has taken place.
Dharmaratne said Metropolitan Communications mother company located in India accessed the PTL call logger system online and gave a report stating that such a reinstallation has been done. According to Metropolitan Communications mother company, PTL has newly installed the call logger system using the backup CD they were provided with initially, to a new computer.
Dharmaratne also informed the PCoI that PTL then has selectively copied call recordings which were in wave file format to the reinstalled call logger system.According to Dharmaratne, call recordings are saved in two different folders belonging to the system.
One folder saves the recorded call in the wave file format while the other records the caller information including call ID, data type, call time, trunk, caller number, call type, duration and the call status, Dharmaratne explained.
Asked as to how Dharmaratne confirms that the call recordings available in the call logger system were selectively copied from the original system, the witness said the data base did not consist sequence numbers which prove the case.
Meanwhile PCoI observed that this evidence may explain as to what happened to some telephone conversations which seemed to have gone missing as informed by the Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake at an earlier stage of the hearing.
Dharmaratne also informed the PCoI that the call logger system that his company sold to PTL included both call recording facility and the call information recording facility.
ASG Kodagoda pointed out that call information relevant to these recordings must then be available, contrary to what PTL CEO Kasun Palisena and PTL IT executive Sachit Devathantri claimed in their affidavits submitted to the PCoI. According to Palisenas affidavit, submitted on August 18, 2017, the call logger system installed in PTL does not record call information such as the incoming or outgoing caller number, time and duration.
ASG Kodagoda asked the witness if Palisenas statement was a big, fat lie followed by laughter from those present at the hearing. The witness said Palisenas statement is incorrect.
Dharmaratne said if call information is needed, the backup system will provide a copy.
Evidence was also led to suggest that PTL may have removed the Acer Aspire 2631 Voice Logger Computer, which is a part of the call logger system originally installed by Metropolitan Communication Limited later to replace it with another computer.
ASG Kodagoda who meticulously led evidence through the witness, hurdled the difficult technical explanations regarding the matter using images of how the call logger system works.
Meanwhile, Senior Additional Solicitor General Dappula de Livera informed the PCoI that there is a possibility of having another computer in to which the original call logger system was installed.
If such be the case, Livera requested the PCoI to issue an order allowing CID to take the removed computer into custody, which will contain the hard disk carrying all the information the PCoI is looking for.
Dharmaratne also informed the PCoI that the reinstallation of the call logger system and its backup system violates the service agreement between PTL and Metropolitan Communication Ltd. According to the service agreement, no modification, removal, alteration, adjustment should be done to the call logger system without consulting the service provider. The agreement, the PCoI observed that was signed by PTL CEO Kasun Palisena.
The PCoI also questioned Dharmaratne on a complaint logged by the PTL stating that some call information are not properly recorded by the system. Explaining the technicalities of the issue, Dharmaratne said the mishap was only related to phone digits being not completely recorded but nothing else. He also said they corrected the issue in December 2015.
Dharmaratne is to be cross examined today (29) by Presidents Counsel Kalinga Indatissa who represents Kasun Palisena.

The Indian Ocean Conference (IOC) 2017 will be held on August 31 and September 1 at the Temple Trees under the theme of Peace, Progress and Prosperity.
Addressing a media briefing on the IOC Conference yesterday, Foreign Affairs Minister Tilak Marapana said around 150 foreign representatives from around 40 countries are expected to participate in the event.
Around eight foreign ministers including Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj and Singapore Foreign Affairs Minister Vivian Balakrishnan are also expected to participate in this conference.
The conference is being co-hosted by the India Foundation in collaboration with RSIS Singapore, and NIFS. This will be the second IOC conference and the first was held in Singapore in 2016. Addressing the occasion, Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Rathnayake said the conference will have speakers from 25 countries and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and President Maithripala Sirisena are among key speakers.
The Minister said, "We are planning to discuss matters related to peace, progress and prosperity of countries of the Indian Ocean. We will also discuss matters related to the drug menace. Drugs are one of the main issues of the region."
"Sri Lanka has been a transit point for large scale drug dealers. Even the LTTE used to smuggle drugs and weapons to fund their organization. The war is over and the LTTE is no longer there. But, the world drug dealers are still operating. Sri Lanka is located strategically where it is a good place to transit drugs. So we are vulnerable to it," he said.
"We have a responsibility to the region and the world to fight this drug menace and also to ensure that there are no drugs in Sri Lanka. We are working very closely with countries in the region. We started a new police range and upgraded our capacity to fight this drug menace within the police," he added.

Scan Technologies' airconditioners save over 50% of energy costs
In a bid to save energy in existing buildings Scan Technologies Global Private Limited, is introducing modern air conditional systems, thus helping to save over 50% of energy costs.
The company which has over ten years of experience in installing, maintaining and servicing elevators and escalators, has already installed a modem AC plant and new system to JAIC Hilton and this is helping to save the company over 55% of its energy costs, said Keerthi Abeynayake, Chairman, Scan Technologies Global Private Limited.
He said that doing away with traditional cooling methods and moving away from huge cooler and chiller rooms, they use copper wires and other new technology to reduce energy costs.
Another unique feature of this system is that one area like a public area of a building could be selected and the air conditioning can be regulated to have more cooling. Similarly when under use, this area could be shut down from the control room.
He said any existing building using the traditional cooling systems could be switched on to this new system by installing their systems which do not need huge changes to the infrastructure of a building.
He also said that they are into elevators and have introduced an elevator which could operate for 25 minutes even in a fire situation. With the inflow of tourism, we see a large potential for the growth in the hospitality industry and our tie up with KONE, a world class brand, will strengthen our confidence in serving the market much better. KONE, a global leader in the elevator and escalator industry, has expanded its operations in the Sri Lankan market and has entered into a distribution agreement with Scan Technologies Global Private Limited recently.
This will also give us additional strength to expand our business and offer better technology for clients, said Abeynayake.
He said that they have a strong after sales service and has a fleet of vehicles including two Mercedes Benz vans to provide mobile assistance.
KONEs history of innovation is one of the companys success factors.
