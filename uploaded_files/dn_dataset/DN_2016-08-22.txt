Young Lions inruthless display
Sri Lanka U19 Youth team under a leader who led his team from the front and by example did extremely well on their tour of England concluded a few days ago winning both series of longer and shorter versions without much resistance from the English side disproving the belief that they too would face problems when playing in English conditions. They acclimatized to the cold and alien conditions in England faster than the other Sri Lankan teams that toured England around this period. Young Lions were so exceptional on this tour that they remained unbeaten after playing five matches against their English counterparts.
Sri Lanka U19s won the two-match Youth Test series 1-0 after Lahiru Kumara, stoutly-built seamer from Trinity College, Kandy completing an outstanding bowling effort with an eleven-wicket match-haul fired Sri Lanka U19 to a seven-wicket victory in the second and final Youth Test played at County Ground, Northampton. The young Lions after they got used to English conditions sooner than expected played so well in the first leg of their tour, the two-match Youth Test series that even in the first four-day Test Sri Lanka after following-on came back very strongly to force a stubborn draw in the end before their series-claimed victory in the following Youth Test.
It was England U19s first home defeat in a 4-day game after six years and it was the same opposition that defeated England on that occasion too in 2010.
England U19s, desperate for recording their first win against Sri Lanka since Lankans arrived in England went into the three-match youth ODI series seeking some consolation at least in the shorter format for which Sri Lanka were the favorites though. Sri Lanka U19s achieved an early lead in the series when they defeated England by a huge margin of 108 runs in the opening one-dayer with skipper Charith Asalanka playing the principal role in both departments.
Though the winning margin of the first match was the highest in the series, Lankans victory in the second match could be rated as the most incredible one in which their batsmen led by Avishka Fernando with a blistering hundred followed by Sammu Ashans match-winning innings helped their side overhaul Englands 300-plus target successfully thereby securing the series with an invincible lead of 2-0. England batted first posting an imposing 315 in their 50 overs with three batsmen completing 50-plus scores. Though 315 looked to be on the safer side for England to break the winning streak of the Lankans and stay alive in the series, Lankans needing a win to record their second successive series win on this tour got off to an excellent start and thereafter maintained a match-winning scoring rate keeping their wickets intact at the same time.
After Dilan Jayalaths 34-ball 41 at the top, Avishka Fernando showing his talent as a classy batsman helped Sri Lanka reach 267 for four before he was unfortunately run-out for a well-compiled 96-ball 117 with 5 fours and a six in the 36th over. Avishkas dismissal at a time Sri Lanka were cruising along brought Sammu Ashan to the middle that became an ideal replacement in the end as Sammu instead of panicking even when wickets started to crumble around him reverted to an unusual calmness with a bullish determination to carry his team over the line.
His rock-solid innings of 75-ball 77 not out after Avishkas century sealed Lankans triumph with five balls and a wicket to spare.
Sri Lanka having won the Test series and already secured the one-day series maintaining a remarkable winning-streak away in England had nothing to loss when they got to the final match of their tour, the third and final youth ODI, but Englands intentions were very clear as they were desperate for recording their first win against Lankans on this tour by hook or crook. Sri Lanka knowing well of their intention batted first and amassed 300, thanks to the Avishka Fernandos back-to-back ton, setting England with a challenging target. Though Sri Lanka overhauled Englands 300-plus total the other day after a great chase, England could not quite do it as they managed only 276 in reply awarding Sri Lanka a 3-0 clean-sweep in the series.
Individual stats of the Youth Test series
Olly Westbury of England topped the batting list with 282 runs at 94 including a century followed by Charith Asalanaka (224 at 56), George Bartlett (158 at 53) and Avishka Fernando (126 at 32). In the bowling, Lahiru Kumara capturing 13 wickets occupied the top spot followed by three Englishmen, GD Panayi (8 wickets), Amar Virdi (6 wickets) and ED Barnes (5 wickets).
Individual stats of the Youth ODI series
Avishka Fernando who played a major part in Lankans 3-0 one-day triumph spanking two glorious centuries led the batting list with 285 runs at an average close to hundred whilst maintaining a strike rate of over hundred. GT Hankins came second with 188 runs followed by Sammu Ashan (156 runs at an amazing 156), Charith Asalanka (127 at 42) and Dilan Jayalath (108 at 36). Ben Green of England who took 8 wickets became the most wicket-taker in the series whilst Lahiru Kumara (6 wickets), Damitha Silva (5 wickets) and Wanindu Hasaranga (5 wickets) occupied the next three spots in the bowling list.

Army SC U23 crowned 2016 U23 D1 T20 Champions
Army SCs U23 team led by former Dharmasoka bowler, Yohan de Silva clinched 2016 U23 D1 T20 Championship when they beat the star-studded SSC U23 led by Ramesh Mendis, another Dharmasoka player of the same era, in the finals concluded at Keththarama on Sunday the 14th ending SSCs glorious winning-streak in this tournament. Army U23 though missed the championship of the first leg of this U23 Tournament, the 2016 U23 D1 limited-over tournament at the last moment when they were beaten in the finals by Chilaw Marians, this time they made no mistake until they grabbed the T20 championship.
Army after they were sent in got off to a flying start as their top three, Ashan Randika (21), Leo Francisco (32) and Dilshan de Soyza (34) batted aggressively maintaining a scoring rate of over eight runs per over in the first 10 overs. This initiative helped them reach a healthy 158 after 20 overs. SSC skipper, Ramesh Mendis once again becoming the top wicket-taker captured 3 wickets conceding just 18 runs from his 4-over spell.
SSC chasing 159 to win soon succumbed to a pathetic position as they lost Minod Bhanuka, Rashmika Opatha and Kavindu Kulasekara even before they had reached double figures with just 12 runs on the board. However, skipper Ramesh Mendis who was the match winner in their semifinal clash against NCC got SSC back on track scoring a 43-ball 58 with two fours and three sixes, but his dismissal with the score at 105 in the 17th over made things difficult for SSC as they needed 54 more runs from just 19 balls with 4 wickets in hand.
After SSCs last recognized batsman, Tharindu Rathnayake soon followed his captain to the pavilion, SSC innings did not last long as they were bowled out for a total of 132. Army bowlers, Nalin Perera, Nirmal Fernando and Dilshan de Soyza who shared six wickets among them at two apiece were instrumental in this remarkable victory as SSCs formidable batting lineup would have easily chased down this modest target if not for the tight bowling of these three.
Army U23: 158/8 in 20 overs (Leo Francisco 32, Dilshan de Soyza 32*, Ramesh Mendis 3/18, T Wijesooriya 2/33)
SSC U23: 132 in 20 overs (Ramesh Mendis 58, Tharindu Rathnayake 20, Nalin Perera 2/21, Nirmal Fernando 2/20, Dilshan de Soyza 2/27)

Right of reply by National Shooting Sport Federation: Ace shooter Samarakoons bottom

We refer to the article title Shooter Samarakoon blames federation for poor show (Dinesh Weerawansa reporting from Rio). In view of the article being totally inaccurate and false the National Shooting Sport Federation wishes to exercise its right of reply referring the comments made by Samarakoon regarding his shooting Jacket being old and unserviceable.
The fact is that Sri Lanka Army had imported the highest quality jacket and trouser incurring a cost exceeding Sri Lanka rupees 150,000/= in the year 2013. Shooters kit needs breaking in over a period of one year and is serviceable for 8-10 years if cared for in the proper manner. Since then he has performed extremely well in many events where the shooting Jacket and Trouser has been tested and passed by many different Technical Delegates and Equipment Control appointed by the ISSF.
The most recent being the Special Olympic Quota competition held in Delhi in January 2016 and the South Asian Games held in Guwahati in February 2016 where he performed at his best. However, at present the National Sport Shooting Federation is also very disappointed with his performance at Rio. We have been reliably informed that the Technical failure of his shooting bottom was due to an unauthorized and illegal modification that Samarakoon had performed along with his coach by fixing an additional strip of Velcro at the waist band despite colleagues of the Army strongly advising him not to carry those alterations through (any device or material modification that gives an unfair advantage to the shooter, violates the rules of ISSF and is therefore illegal). This altered the permitted specifications of the bottom which had successfully passed several international equipment controls at the recent foreign competitions.
Samarakoon as a previous Olympic competitor as well as an experienced international competitor should be well aware of international rules and regulations. Further, more his personal coach Pushpamali Ramanayaka being a veteran shooter and handpicked by Army to coach the Army team has failed miserably by not performing her duty as a Coach nor as a Manager both titles which she carried at this particular competition. The shooters and coachs comments are very unfair towards the Sri Lanka Army too which have supported its shooters with 1.2 million .22 ammunition of the highest quality imported in 2013 in addition to a brand new Air Rifle imported at a cost of Rs.650,000/= in 2013 as well as a brand new .22 Rifle imported at a cost of Rs.700,000/= in 2013, as well as the fact that he is paid a monthly salary to perform NO other duty except training for shooting competitions daily as his primary and only job description.
Therefore, Samarakoon and Pushpamalis comments reflect very badly on the Sri Lanka Army which has done so much for them by way of facilities, equipment and finance purely for competition shooting. None of the Sri Lankan shooters earned a Quota place for this particular Olympics. However, due to the excellent rapport the National Shooting Sport Federation has maintained with the International Shooting Sport Federation we were fortunate to receive a tripartite invitation for Men 60 prone event which was supposed to be Samarakoons primary objective based on the invitation.However, the International Shooting Sport Federation was good enough to accommodate Samarakoon in the Mens 10 meter Air Rifle event also.
The National Shooting Sport Federation with the help of the Ministry of Sports and the National Olympic Committee conducted a coaching program for coaches at which Ramanayaka too participated. Samarakoon too benefited from a another initiative launched by the National Shooting Federation with the help of the Ministry of Sports where two foreign coaches extended their services in preparing our shooters for the Olympic Quota place event as well as for the South Asian Games.
In order to further facilitate Samarakoon, the National Shooting Sport Federation imported and installed on an urgent basis four Electronic Targets for training which Pushpamali Ramanayaka (coach) refused to make use of despite several calls by the General Secretary of the National Shooting Sport Federation urging them to further fine tune their skills in preparation of the Olympic Games. As for their grievance with regard to the inaction by the National Shooting Sport Federation regarding clearance of weapons it was in fact the General Secretary of the National Shooting Sport Federation who obtained the Sports Ministry and Defence Ministry clearances while Captain Ranawaka of the Sri Lanka Army worked tirelessly in liaison with the General Secretary in obtaining all other approvals.
It must be mentioned that these were the primary duties of the Manager/Coach Pushpamali Ramanayaka who did not move a finger in this instance.
In previous instances it was the officials of the National Shooting Sport Federation that grabbed the privilege of being the Manager or Coach. However, in this instance the National Shooting Sport Federation heeded to the request of the shooter and his alliance the Sri Lanka Army Small Arms Association to permit Pushpamali Ramanayake to be his chosen Coach/Manager. Unfortunately contrary to the intuition of the Sri Lanka Army she has failed Sri Lanka Army, National Shooting Sport Federation and her country. Unlike on previous instances the officials of the clubs affiliated to the National Shooting Sport Federation went to the extent of even donating personal funds as pocket money as a special gesture of encouragement and solidarity to our competitor.
Therefore, it is very deeply regrettable and sad that unwarranted, unfounded and biased comments leveled against the National Shooting Sport Federation which has really been their benefactors in more ways than one.

Millennium Housing Developers invests Rs. 2 billion for two apartments

Sri Lanka's leading mega township developer Millennium Housing Developers Plc (MHD) has invested over Rs. 2 billion this year to build the two apartment complexes, Heights at Nawala Road, Colombo 05 and The Heights at Edmonton Road, Colombo 5.
Nawaloka Group Group Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa said that they are targeting the mid range customers and this is the key for their success.
The Heights at Nawala Road Colombov 5 builds on the success of MHDs extremely successful inaugural high-rise project The Heights at Edmonton Road, Colombo 5 that was sold out in three weeks after launch.
While MHD is well known for township development, the entry of Nawaloka group as majority shareholder and lead contractor is widely seen as a contributory factor in boosting market confidence and demand for MHD high-rise developments.
The Heights at Nawala Road Colombo 5 sees the unveiling of a landmark building incorporating modern living style and energy saving design.
It comprises 14 storeys housing 64 intelligently designed units, which maximise space utilisation to deliver superior living spaces of style, elegance and attractive value. More importantly, it is located by the side of the Narahenpita-Nawala main road, promising higher rate of appreciation, Marketing Director Mevan Serasinhe said.
He said that Diaspora who wants to retire in Sri Lanka are their main buyers along with expatriates and Sri Lankans.
Six layouts and several exclusive interior designs add individuality and character to the apartments, which include four very unique penthouses  each of them enjoying a panoramic view of Colombo city and outskirts.
Rooftop entertainment area is complete with swimming pool, plush seating and walk path, gym and sitting out areas. A unique Solar PV Net metering system takes the load off residents for powering common areas and amenities.
Nawaloka Group Chairman Jayantha Dharmadasa,Millennium Housing Developers Chairman Harshith Dharmadasa and officials at the Heights Nawala Road ground breaking ceremony.

A home library promises hours of tranquil mental enrichment to residents. Bed rooms and living areas of each apartment are air conditioned for ultimate comfort and are fitted with high quality imported material.
Parking slot for each unit and extra parking for visitors, 24 hour controlled security and standby generators, rain water harvesting system, solar panels for power generation; coin operated automatic laundry service, drivers units within parking area make for luxurious living without sacrificing practicality. Millennium Housing Developers CEO Sisira Weerabahu pointed out that the high rise projects are managed through MC Urban Developers Ltd., a fully owned subsidiary of MHD.
