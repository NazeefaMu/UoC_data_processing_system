France beat Uruguay to reach World Cup semi-finals
NIZHNY NOVGOROD Friday: France became the first team to reach the World Cup semi-finals as goals from Raphael Varane and Antoine Griezmann gave them a deserved 2-0 victory over Uruguay on Friday.
It is the first time France have been in the last four since 2006 and sets up a mouth-watering clash against either Belgium or Brazil, who play later on Friday, in St Petersburg on Tuesday.
France took the lead in the 40th minute from the unlikely source of defender Varane, who glanced home a fine header from an Antoine Griezmann free-kick.
It was only the Real Madrid player's third goal for France and represented redemption for Varane, who was largely blamed for the goal which saw France lose at the quarter-final stage to Germany four years ago.
Griezmann, who counts several of the Uruguay players as close friends, scored a second in the 61st minute, but it was mostly due to a howler from La Celeste's goalkeeper, Fernando Muslera.
The usually dependable stopper flapped at Griezmann's 20-yard shot and agonisingly saw the ball float over the line.
It was Griezmann's third goal of this World Cup, but his first not from a penalty.
That goal secured the victory but did not end the drama in Nizhny Novgorod, as Uruguay's frustration boiled over in the 67th minute when Kylian Mbappe fell to the floor.
Uruguay's skipper Diego Godin gestured with the teenager to get up, then tried to pull him from the turf, sparking a melee which involved most of the players and saw French coach Didier Deschamps come onto the pitch to try to calm tempers.
France's victory was merited as it was they who had the bulk of possession and always looked the most likely to score.
They might have scored as early as the 15th minute when Mbappe mistimed a close header.
The lightning-quick Mbappe and Griezmann struck fear into the Uruguayan defence all afternoon.
In midfield, France's N'Golo Kante and Paul Pogba snuffed out any potential threat posed by Uruguay.

Germany boss admits mistakes over Ozil at World Cup
BERLIN Jfriday: In the wake of their shock World Cup exit, Germany team boss Oliver Bierhoff has said Mesut Ozil should have been dropped over a pre-tournament scandal involving Turkey president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.
Ozil, 29, is one of a group of senior players slammed for woeful performances in Russia as Germany finished bottom of their group to suffer a shock early exit.
At the World Cup, the Arsenal midfielder refused to comment about a controversial meeting on the eve of the finals with Erdogan which sparked questions about his loyalty to Germany.
Bierhoff admits it was a mistake to allow Ozil to stay silent as the controversy cast a shadow over the German camp.
We have never compelled players in the German national team to do something, but always tried to convince them when it comes to certain things, Bierhoff, Germanys team director, told Fridays edition of Die Welt newspaper.
We did not succeed with Mesut. And in that respect one would have had to consider whether to refrain from playing him. Ozil and Ilkay Gundogan, who both have Turkish roots, were booed by German fans in pre-World cup friendlies after posing for pictures with Erdogan. Manchester City striker Gundogan presented him with a signed club shirt on which he had written to my president.
Gundogan denied the meeting was politically motivated, but Ozil refused to comment and was the only member of the 23-man squad allowed to miss a media day at Germanys pre-World Cup camp.
Bierhoff says he and head coach Joachim Loew should have seriously considered leaving Ozil out of the final squad for Russia.
They fact that Mesut and Ilkay took the pictures did not bother the team so much, but the debate went on and, in retrospect, I would have tried to deal with this issue more decisively, admitted Bierhoff.
Ozil was slammed on social media for woeful World Cup displays in the shock group stage defeats to Mexico and South Korea having been dropped for the last-gasp win over Sweden.
Bierhoff says Ozils silence was an issue especially as we did not present ourselves as a team -- the energy that always made us strong was not there.

Government yet to accomplish commitments to IC: Sampanthan
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said the government is yet to accomplish most of its commitments to the International Community (IC). The expectations of the international community in the best interest of the people of Sri Lanka has not been fulfilled by the Government, Sampanthan said.
The Opposition Leader made these observations when outgoing United States Ambassador Atul Keshap paid a courtesy call on him at the Opposition Leaders office on Thursday.
Highlighting the commitments made by the Sri Lankan Government in the cosponsored resolution adopted at the United Nations Human Rights Council in 2015, Sampanthan said, the Office of the Missing Persons was established after a long delay, the Reparations bill is not yet passed, there had been no steps taken to address the Accountability issues, the commission on Truth, Justice, Reconciliation and non-Recurrence has not been constituted, the Constitutional process took a positive start but there seems to be delay in taking it forward.
Given the fact that there had been plenty of work done around the framing of a new Constitution for over 25 years, I dont see any justifiable reasons for delay in this. Our primary interest is in the best interest of the country, and everyone in this country will benefit from a new Constitution, Sampanthan said
Mustering a two-third Majority in Parliament need not be that difficult to adopt a new Constitution, Sampanthan said.
We have been absolutely reasonable in our demands. If the Government does not deliver, the Tamil people are not going to be second-class citizens in this country, he said.
The Ambassador pointed out that as far as the United States is concerned that the UNHRC Resolution remains operative and it is fundamental for several bilateral relationships. He said the objectives of the country should remain positive in order to achieve peace and reconciliation. The positive image that the Government of Sri Lanka has in the international stage should not be taken for granted. He also highlighted that Sri Lanka will be able to attract more investors and will have more economic benefits if it adopts a new Constitution. He said the United States of America will remain fully engaged with the progress made by the Sri Lankan government in the future. He also thanked Sampanthan for his support during his tenure as the Ambassador.
Sampanthan appreciated the role played by the Ambassador and his team and the US State Department in the past with regard to Sri Lanka and appealed that the same level of engagement should continue with all parties in the future.
Along with the Opposition Leader, TNA Spokesman and Jaffna District Parliamentarian M.A. Sumanthiran was present at the meeting. The Ambassador was accompanied by Deputy Chief of Mission Robert Hilton and Political Officer Joanna Pritchett.

Govt. has guaranteed future of SAITM students - President
The Government could have closed the SAITM if it was not concernend about the students grievances, on the very first day that the protest began in 2015, President Maithripala Sirisena said yesterday.
The President added that the government needed to secure the future of the SAITM students since they too are children of our nation.
I am very happy that the students future was guaranteed by absorbing them to the Kotelawala Defence University Medical Faculty, President Sirisena said.
The President also said that he personally got involved in finding a solution to this matter in a manner that no other leader had been involved.
President Sirisena was addressing SAITM students and their parents at the Nelum Pokuna Theatre yesterday on the absorption of students to the KDU.
The President further said that while many protests were held for three years against the SAITM, it was he who held the highest number of discussions to solve the issue.
I treated this matter as one of my own, President Sirisena said.
A political leader cant discriminate against students whether they study in government or private universities. I can relate to this issue as I was the Health Minister for five years, the President said.
President Sirisena said he knew as to who was behind the issue and where it was originated.
The President added that as the former Health Minister, he helped make the SAITM a university with international standards. But, when we came to power, the government medical students were brought on to the streets by certian parties with vested interests for political gains, the President said.
We have been able to solve the issue in a constructive manner. I faced much criticism over this issue, the President said.
President Sirisena also said he discussed the matter with members of the Inter University Students Federation despite the objection of a number of politicians.
During the discussion, I told them that there are private universities in almost all other countries, to which they responded that in all those countries there are protests against private universities, the President said.
President Sirisena also said that the government has accepted the policy to improve private sector education, while improving State sector education.
The President added that the facilities of the KDU too would be developed in due course, while the government will also take measures to monitor the quality of education at private schools and universities.
Hogher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, Defence Secretary Kapila Waidyaratne, University Grants Commission Chairman Prof. Mohan de Silva and Kotelawala Defence University Vice Chancellor Rear Admiral J.J. Ranasinghe were also present.

Govt has no intention to curtail social media  Minister
Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera yesterday flatly rejected claims that the Government was planning to ban certain social media websites, saying censorship never works.
Today anyone with a smartphone can become a sort of journalist and so fake news remains a big challenge. But censorship is never a suitable solution at all. We should have the courage to face any adverse reports or accusations. If we cant stomach those, it is better to disregard to ignore them, Minister Samaraweera told a gathering at the Finance Ministry.
He took a swipe at those calling for curbing press freedom, noting we cannot control the medias freedom. We cannot ban news. We have to face the media.We cannot and we do not want to censor websites or any other media outlet.
However, he pointed out the need to create a more socially and ethically responsible media for the future.
The Minister recalled how editors and journalists were killed, assaulted and intimidated during the previous regime. On the other hand, this Government had granted complete freedom to the media to harshly criticize Government figures including the President and the Prime Minister and also Government projects.
The Minister reiterated his condemnation of verbal threats against the two local journalists involved in the New York Times (NYT) expose of a transaction of US$ 7.6 million during the previous regime.
The NYT has raised very serious allegations in this regard. The Thera mentioned in the story has acknowledged that a Chinese person had given him US$ 38,000. Judging by the same token, the other allegations cannot be false. However if they are, MP Mahinda Rajapaksa should have already sued the NYT without making various allegations against the local journalists. That is what I would have done if this happened to me. So far, there is no indication of that happening.
The Minister said the NYT has already urged Rajapaksa and others to speak to their top editors in New York, who had maintained that they saw the documents relevant to the transaction, instead of taking up cudgels with the local journalists.
Asked whether this could lead to a diplomatic row with China, the Minister replied if our leaders and politicians take bribes from other countries, it might lead to diplomatic incidents.
State Minister of Finance Eran Wickremaratne said the Presidential Awards would be especially beneficial to young journalists. It would encourage more young people to enter journalism. These awards are symbolic of our desire to protect democracy and media freedom.Today, we have ensured media freedom like never before. Ven.Dambara Amila Thera said recently that he harshly criticised the President on many occasions but to date no one had even called him to say anything about it. This shows the level of media freedom and general democracy in the country, he added.
Deputy Media Minister Lasantha Alagiyawanna said the Presidential Media Awards would lead to a qualitative improvement in the media. It will encourage not only award winners, but other journalists as well to perform better and win next time. The Government has always recognised the role of media. For example, all media institutions rallied to educate the public on dengue during the recent epidemic situation. This award ceremony will be just one measure among many aimed at developing the media.
Ministry Secretary Dr. R.H.S. Samaratunga outlined the structure of the award ceremony and eligibility criteria.

Gross official foreign reserves up - CB Governor
The countrys Gross official foreign reserves have greatly improved to around USD 9.2 billion by the end of June, said Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy yesterday.
At the end of 2017, reserves stood at USD 8 billion.
Addressing a media briefing at the Central Bank premises in Fort, the Central Bank Governor explained that the Successful issuance of the International Sovereign Bond in April 2018, receipt of the fifth tranche of the Extended Fund Facility of the IMF, receipts from the divestiture of the Hambantota Port and foreign exchange purchases of the Central Bank from the domestic market in early 2018, had greatly helped improve the situation.
The Central Bank recorded a net foreign exchange absorption of USD 141 million from the domestic market in the first half of 2018.
Economic growth this year however has to be slow to pick up with the economy recording 3.2 percent year on year in the first quarter of 2019, compared to the revised annual growth rate of 3.3 percent in 2017.
Economic growth this year however has been mainly driven by services and agriculture, with industry showing moderate growth. Agriculture has picked up with the end of the drought that has plagued many districts for the last three years.
When it came to export earnings, the Governor noted, The moderation of earnings from exports alongside the increase in import expenditure resulted in an expansion of the trade deficit over the first four months of 2018.
The recent growth in imports had been largely driven by the importation of personal vehicles and gold, the latter is expected to have been addressed by the imposition of the customs duty on gold imports, he said.
Earnings from tourism and workers remittances however have continued their positive growth momentum so far during the year.

London, Friday: Indian fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah will play no role in the upcoming three-match ODI series with England after undergoing surgery on a broken thumb, the Board of Control for Cricket in India said Friday.
The 24-year-old -- more a regular in the ODI team than the Test line-up -- broke it during the first of the two-match T20 international series with Ireland last week.
He has been replaced by Shardul Thakur for the ODI series -- the Indians are yet to name their squad for the five-Test series which gets underway in August.
The all-India senior selection committee has named Shardul Thakur as Jasprit Bumrahs replacement in Indias ODI squad, the BCCI statement said.
Bumrah underwent a surgery on Wednesday, July 4 in Leeds before returning to India.
The surgery was successful and he will commence rehabilitation under the supervision of the BCCI medical team.
India play England later on Friday in the second match of their T20 series with the tourists fresh from an eight wicket thrashing of the hosts.
The ODI series gets underway next Thursday at Trent Bridge, Nottingham.

Kane sends records tumbling as he targets World Cup glory
MOSCOW Friday : Harry Kane is leading the race for the World Cup Golden Boot as he bids to become the first England player to win the prize since Gary Lineker 32 years ago.
The clean-cut skipper is on the fast track to virtual sainthood in England, matching Lineker's tally of six goals from 1986 in just three matches in Russia to set up a quarter-final against Sweden.
Kane scored twice against Tunisia in England's first match in Russia and then bagged a hat-trick in a 6-1 romp against Panama.
Gareth Southgate rested Kane for the third group game -- a 1-0 defeat to Belgium -- but the Tottenham striker returned to score from the penalty spot against Colombia in the last 16.
In doing so the England captain became the first player to score in six consecutive England appearances since Tommy Lawton in 1939.
Gareth Southgate's side play the Swedes in Samara on Saturday, eyeing their first semi-final since 1990, a defeat against Germany in which Lineker played and scored.
London-born Kane insists it is lifting the World Cup rather than individual honours that remains his priority.

Luxury vehicle owners, leisure travellers will be taxed - Tax Chief
The Inland Revenue Department identifies every individual who maintains a luxury vehicle and persons who travel abroad on holiday as taxable parties.We are of the view of that a tax should be imposed on such individuals, Inland Revenue Commissioner General Ivan Dissanayake said.
He made the above statement to the media following a workshop held at Dalawella in Galle on Wednesday.
"An individual who upkeeps a super luxury vehicle spends about Rs.500,000 with an average monthly expenditure of around 50,000 on such vehicle. Many Sri Lankans who tour overseas on every vacation are also considered as persons with a tax payable revenue. In Sri Lanka there are 1.6 million tax payers and we hope to raise the number by another 1 million by 2020," he said.
The Inland Revenue Department is at present actively connected with 32 state institutions to collect information on public servants also. "Based on revenue details obtained from organizations, we will have to advice them to open tax files and sometimes such officials will be asked to reveal their income avenues.So we request all who are in receipt of a taxable revenue to open a tax file on their own volition and fulfill their national obligation, Dissanayake said.
The main sources of state income are the Inland Revenue Department, the Customs Department and the Excise Department.
"The government spends Rs. 47,000 on a school child during his schooling period.When you multiply that amount by the total number of students in the country, you will understand the massive expenditure we have to bear on education.The State also spends Rs. 550,000 to train a doctor per year. To produce an engineer the government spends nearly Rs. 400,000 per year. It is the duty and obligation of all those who benefitted from public funds to contribute their share to the country in return for what the country gave for them," he said.
We are planning to increase the direct taxes up to 40% and indirect taxes up to 60% by 2020. The government had to suffer a loss of Rs.1200 million due to the elimination of VAT in respect channelling services of hospitals.
We have a population of 22 million out of which only 175,000 individuals have been registered for tax payments and only 75,000 persons pay taxes.Although there are 80,000 companies registered with the government only 45,000 firms pay the respective taxes.We are determined to increase the number up to 2.2 million by 2020.

Lyles lights up Lausanne, mayhem in 5000m
Lausanne, Thursday: American sprinter Noah Lyles matched a season's best time of 19.69sec in the men's 200m as Birhanu Balew won a 5000m marred by final bend mayhem at the Lausanne Diamond League on Thursday.
Fresh from setting a best time of the year to capture the US 100m title last month the 20-year-old Lyles had enough up his sleeve to deny his compatriot Michael Norman (19.88).
After celebrating with an impromptu trackside dance Lyles said "19.69 is great but you can always improve".
He added: "My life goals are big - I want to be as good if not better than Michael Johnson and Justin Gatlin."
In contrast to Lyles, Norman's immediate ambition was altogether more modest.
"I want to relax now and have some good Swiss ice cream."
Qatar's Abderrahman Samba sauntered to another 400m hurdle success.
Samba registered the latest chapter in a golden season with his sixth Diamond League win to add to his titles in Doha, Rome, Oslo, Stockholm, and Paris.
Last Saturday in the French capital he set the second-fastest time ever for the distance of 46.98sec.
He couldn't match that but he didnt need to as his 47.42 was good enough to deny Norway's Karsten Warholm (47.94) and Yasmani Copello of Turkey.
"I started quicker than normal and the last 100m were difficult," said Samba.
"The aim for the season remains the Asian Games at the end of August," he added.
In the 110m hurdles there was redemption for Sergey Shubenkov, the current world champion from Russia who was harshly ruled to have false started in Paris last weekend.
He posted a time of 12.95 with American Devon Allen (13.29) and France's Pascal Martinot-Lagarde in his slipstream.
"It's my best season," smiled Shubenkov.
Along with Samaba another star of last weekend's meet in Paris was Caster Semenya, who put her run-in with the IAAF over controversial new rules on testosterone to one side as she scorched to the fourth-fastest time ever run in the women's 800m.
Choosing to line up in Lausanne in the 1500m she failed to follow up, coming in sixth behind American Shelby Houlihan.
In the women's 100m, Ivorian Marie-Josee Ta Lou confirmed her status as the one to beat in 10.90 in front of Jamaican Elaine Thompson, the doulbe Olympic champion in Rio.
"I wasn't in my best form either," commented Ta Lou. "I only ran 11.12 in Budapest (on Monday)." - AFP

The winners dominated a one sided affair, where the HyLine footballers put on a good game of run and pass football, and Sisu SC were completely outplayed . The HyLine footballers dominated the first half 8-0 and ran riot against an inexperienced Sisu SC. The winners played an unfamiliar defensive midfield role. In the second half the winning side, did not go for goals like in the first half, but treated the Sisu footballers like playthings, by controlling the game with good passes and made the opponents look like babes.
Some Kandy schools pull out of 7s rugby

Maradona apologises over Colombia-England referee slur
MOSCOW, Thursday - Diego Maradona has apologised for questioning the impartiality of the referee in charge of Englands last-16 penalty shootout win over Colombia.
The Argentina legend had landed himself in hot water with FIFA over his outburst at US official Mark Geiger when he described Englands win on Tuesday as a monumental robbery.
But after a firm rebuke by footballs governing body the 1986 World Cup winner issued a mea culpa on Instagram.
Caught up by the excitement and support for Colombia the other day, I said some things that, I admit, are unacceptable. My apologies to FIFA and its president (Gianni Infantino): even if sometimes my opinions are different to those of the referees I have total respect for their work.
He admitted that although I sometimes have opinions contrary to those of referees, I have absolute respect for the work -- not easy -- which (FIFA) and the referees do.
Maradona, who had come out in support of Colombia following Argentinas premature elimination, blamed Geiger for the South American sides loss in an ill-tempered affair.
He had told Venezuelan TV channel Telesur: I apologise to all the Colombian people, but the players are not to blame.
Here is a gentleman (FIFA referees boss Pierluigi Collina) who decides to choose a referee who, if he had Googled him, (he would know) cant be used for a match of this magnitude.
Geiger was suspended from international football for six months after several controversial decisions during a 2015 Gold Cup semi-final between Panama and Mexico.
Maradona had attended the Colombia v England match as a guest of FIFA and was pictured before the game in Moscow wearing a Colombia shirt. AFP

Maxwell powers Australia to T20 win over Zimbabwe
HARARE friday: Glenn Maxwell paid tribute to coach Justin Langer after cracking 56 to help Australia beat Zimbabwe with a ball to spare in Harare on Friday.
Zimbabwe batted first and made 151 for nine wickets in their 20 overs, led by 63 from Solomon Mire.
In reply, Australia reached 154 when Matt Stoinis hit a boundary off the penultimate with five wickets down.
When Maxwell reached his first half century in a T20I since his hundred against England in Hobart in February, he gestured at his eyes. It was a reference to the work he and Langer have put in making sure Maxwell watches the ball.
Ive been doing a lot of work with JL recently, making sure Im watching the ball as hard as I can, Maxwell said. Ive been doing a lot of work with that in the nets, making sure Im really concentrating. Thats all Im thinking about at the moment. So that was just a little gesture towards him. Australias middle order were made to graft early by Zimbabwe, who nipped out openers Aaron Finch and Alex Carey in the first five overs.
Australia took just 35 runs from the Powerplay and it wasnt until Maxwell began to find the middle of his bat that they started to bring the scoring rate down.
Maxwell was particularly harsh on Zimbabwes spinners, collecting sixes off Malcolm Waller, Wellington Masakadza and debutant Brandon Mavuta to bring up a 34-ball fifty in the 17th over.
It was probably just the timing of when they were bowling, Maxwell said of his assault on Zimbabwes slow bowlers. Id got myself in and Id faced 10 or 15 balls and was able to expand from there. The offspinner came on when Id been out there for four or five overs, so that was the time for me to go. Together, Maxwell and Travis Head, who made 48, put on 103 for the third wicket to steady Australias chase.
Its good batting with a guy like Heady, he takes a lot of pressure off you, said Maxwell. With the way he plays, he hits it in different areas and puts some pressure on the bowler. Weve done it a few times, not just in T20 cricket but in one-day cricket as well. The pair seemed to have made the match safe for Australia, but Maxwells departure, driving fast bowler Blessing Muzarabani into the hands of Elton Chigumbura at extra cover, sparked a late fightback from the Zimbabweans.
They took three wickets in three overs after getting rid of Maxwell to take the game into the final over, but Stoinis lifted the penultimate delivery over square leg to seal the match.
The challenging total set by the Zimbabweans was thanks mainly toMire, who made 63 off 52 balls and helped his team recover from the dismissal of Cephas Zhuwao from the first ball of the morning.
Together with PJ Moor he rebuilt the innings with a 64-run fourth wicket stand. Moor eventually fell for 30, chasing quick runs, but Mire brought up a 44-ball fifty in the 17th over.
Zimbabwe then lost four wickets in two overs on the charge at the death, with Andrew Tye once again starring with the ball, but reached a total which very nearly sparked an upset.
Australias win in this dead rubber provides a welcome confidence boost ahead of their clash with number one ranked Pakistan in Sundays final.

Mexico swings Left
Mexico, the country with the Second largest economy in Latin America turned Left last Sunday when Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador, affectionately known as ALMO, candidate of the Movement for National Regeneration (Morena Party) won the Presidential election with a huge 53.3 percent of the vote pushing Hose Antonio Meade of the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party (PRI) into Third place with only 15.7 percent. Candidate of the democratic Action Party Ricardo Ana came Second with 23 percent of the vote.
Morena party also won a comfortable majority in both Houses of Parliament  the 328 seat Senate and 500 strong Chamber of Deputies. The new President will assume office on December 1, 2018.
Latin America is a region were election results were swinging from Left to right and vice-versa frequently. Ever since dictatorships propped up and maintained with the sponsorship of Washington were replaced by progressive military or civilian rule some countries have seen the establishment of rightwing conservative governments in several countries such as Brazil, Chile and Columbia. What worries Washington is not so much the victory of AMLO but whether the victory would have a domino effect in the rest of America. We witnessed few weeks ago how the victory of a popular Left candidate was thwarted by unconstitutional means in Uruguay even after announcing his victory.
It was after 70 years that the people of Mexico have been able to defeat conservative parties.
Little over half of Mexicos 120 million population or 53 percent approximately are poor. Of them 10 million are extremely poor. President-elect Labrador has promised to implement a programme different from the neo-liberal project undertaken so far with a particular pro-poor focus.
President Trump has congratulated the new President and expressed his wish to work together. These sentiments were reciprocated by Labrador also. However, relations between the two countries were beset with many problems. For example, the United States has an adverse trade balance with Mexico. Last year Mexico exported US $ 340 billion worth goods to the US while it imported only goods worth US $ 236 billion. Besides, President Trump wants to revise NAFTA or withdraw from it. Also he has a plan to build a wall along the Mexican border and charge Mexico part of the cost of construction, a proposition which Mexico has rejected.
Drug trafficking and crime are two serious problems remaining to be solved. President Labrador looks at the poor who deal in trafficking with sympathy while fighting the criminal Drug Lords who have private armies and terrorize the population and government officials. Since 2006 there were 200,000 homicides and over 159,000 involuntary disappearances in Mexico. There were 25,000 homicides last year alone.
The last Presidential election was also full of criminal actions by the ruling party, the election period 145 politicians were killed and 543 received injuries. There was large scale vote buying and distribution of goods and money to bribe the voters.
Indo-US relations strained
President Trumps unconventional foreign policy decisions, some of which affect friend and foe alike have caused friction in Indo-US relations forcing India to explore other options.
For example, its decision to withdraw from the six-party international nuclear accord with Iran and its decision to punish those countries that deal with Iran would affect Indo-Iranian trade, especially in the energy sector. Similarly US sanctions against Russia affects Indias defense interests.
During her recent visit to New Delhi US envoy to the United Nations Nikki Haley is reported to have asked India to revise its relationship with Iran, a proposal New Delhi has not taken a liking to.
Prime Minister Narendra Modi seems to look for other alternatives. Despite US pressure to absorb India into an anti-Chinese bloc with Japan, Australia and Israel, despite the five nation Naval drill in the Pacific; India joined the Shanghai Cooperation Council last week as a full member along with Pakistan.
Premier Mod speaking at the Shangri-La Dialogue last month, invoked the phrase strategic autonomy, hinting that there is a rethinking in his foreign policy. Since January, he has personally reached out to the Chinese and Russian Presidents in informal summits, and invited the Iranian President to Delhi.
As the Hindu editorially noted Mr. Modi has had little contact with Mr. Trump since their meeting in Manila last November, which by all accounts did not go well. Now, the postponement of the Indian Foreign and Defence Ministers 2+2 dialogue with their U.S. counterparts has denied the governments a chance to gather together the fraying bilateral threads.
In Indian foreign policy what is paramount is the national interest and not personal glory or partisan politics.

MR should reveal agreement with China Harbour - MP
UNP Colombo District MP Mujibur Rahuman said yesterday that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa should reveal what kind of agreement he had with China Harbour company to receive US$ 7.6 million for his election campaign.
As far as we know private companies do not give money to politicians without a reason.We like to know what former President promised to give them if he came to power, he said.
Today, we are in a Chinese debt trap having obtained loans at highest interest rate of more than 6 percent. Both the Mattala airport and Hambantota port begun by former President from Chinese funds are loss making ventures today.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he called on President Maithripala Sirisena to appoint a special Presidential Commission to probe what kind of promises former President had pledged to China.
We would also like to know whether this the attempt of selling public property to China. We know that many projects including Port city were given to China on a freehold basis.
Eventhough the China Harbour company had rejected the report published in the New York Times, in a recently issued press release, it had never said anywhere that they did not give money to the former President. So, we want to know whether Standard Chartered Bank too refused to issue cheques amounting to US$ 7.6 Million and US$ 3.7 M Dollars to Mahinda Rajapaksas 2015 Election Campaign via two Standard Chartered Bank accounts.

No room for Hitlers, Bokasas and Idi Amins - Kabir Hashim
There is no room for Hitlers, Bokasas and Idi Amins in Buddhism and therefore there can exist no such Kings in our country, Minister Kabir Hashim said.
Addressing a meeting following the inauguration of the Prathiba Exhibition at the UC grounds in Warakapola he stressed that King Chandasoka of India mended his ways and policies to turn into a peaceful, kind and compassionate King only after becoming an adherent of Buddhist philosophy.
It is thereafter that he was named Dharmasoka and Mihindu Maha Thera who introduced Buddhism to Sri Lanka was his son. Sri Lanka became a peaceful and prosperous country because of great Kings who followed Buddhism.
The best gift from Sri Lanka to the world is Buddhism since administrators were loved by their subjects due to Buddhist philosophy, the Mnister said.

Musthapha calls for Round-Table Conference:To discuss pros and cons of new electoral system
Local Government and Provincial Councils Minister Faiszer Musthapha, expressing his strong opposition to reverting to the old electoral system, called for a round-table discussion of all parties to rectify the identified shortcomings of the new system.
The Minister, joining in the Adjournment Motion on the Provincial Councils Election system in Parliament yesterday, roundly criticized Sri Lanka Muslim Congress (SLMC) Leader and Minister Rauf Hakeem, accusing him of resorting to communal politics.
Even Minister Rauf Hakeem raised his hands for the new system. Many minority parties get on to the foot-board of a national party, invoke racism in their polls campaigns to bag more votes and increase the number of their MPs. This was possible under the PR system. Deprivation of this opportunity, is the problem they have with the new system, he said.
Under the new system, no ethnic group gets undue favour and injustice. No party, no citizen of this country should think only of their community. Unfortunately, they only think of how best they could bargain. We saw that in the Eastern Province. Many of those parties do not contest alone. They contest under the ticket of national parties. They market their ethnicity, he raged against Hakeem.
Assuring that the Muslim representation would not be affected by the new electoral system, Musthapha went on to note that the new system of 50:50 for PR and First-Past-the-Post system was agreed as a result of a request by the same leaders of minority parties who now speak against it.
There could be a certain reduction in the number of seats these foot-board parties get. The Muslim community is not solely represented by those foot-board parties. In the past, Muslims were members of national parties, but now national parties are in the habit of outsourcing minority votes. Ultimately what happens is that the tail wags the dog. That is a very unfortunate situation, he added.
Batting for the new electoral system, Musthapha said PRAFFREL and CMEV representatives who had met him on Thursday, asked him not to revert to the old system as the new system had many progressive features. The preferential vote created intra-party rivalry and led to the deterioration of the political culture. The last LG election was the most peaceful election in the history of Sri Lanka, he observed.
He also held the Delimitation Committee responsible for the current mess. I wrote to the Delimitation Committee Chairman K Thavalingam, with a request to hold an all-party conference before handing over the report to me. However, they said that they had no mandate for that. There are loopholes in the report, he said.
It is not ethical to go back to the previous corrupt preferential votes system just because the elections are getting delayed. How many of the members who spoke today proposed alternative solutions to address the identified problems Many wanted to go back to the old corrupt system as they failed to get the intended results at the last LG elections. I have summoned many meetings at my ministry to discuss the electoral system. How many of those who make a big noise in the House today, were present for those meetings They dont support to make it a better system, but simply try to do politics by marketing their ethnicity, he further complained.
This is a joke. Going back to the old system would aggravate racist politics. Even though some are dressed as gentlemen, they engage in dirty politics. Sometimes, national parties are restrained in their activity due to pressure from the minority parties.
We have to change this culture and unless we do so, our politics would have no future. We have to change the peoples racist mentality. Even though I belong to a minority ethnic group, I love this country. I think as a Sri Lankan. Doing politics with a racist label is easy for me too, but we genuinely think about reconciliation and the way forward for the country. It is with regret that I make this speech today, he noted.
He pointed out, as the politicians fail, some civil organizations have come up with proposals to address the loopholes of the new system. If we decided to go back to the PR system with the preferential votes, the common man will rise against us, he concluded.
AGs recommendations not needed for action against Vijayakala: Weerawansa
There is no need to wait for recommendations of the Attorney General to take action against State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran over her controversial statement on wanting the LTTE brought back, as she had herself, admitted to having made such a statement, said the National Freedom Front leader Wimal Weerawansa.
MP Weerawansa making a special statement in Parliament with permission from the Chair, said, On July 7, LTTE was commemorated in the North. The LTTE emblem was painted on roads, while LTTE slogans were painted on the walls and teachers came out onto the streets with their students and lit lamps in commemoration of the fallen terrorists. Meanwhile, Awa and several other gangs are gradually being strengthened in the North. When such activities are being allowed freely, the rule of law in the North is bound to collapse.
That is the reason perhaps that the State Ministers stress levels would have risen. Hence, I would wish to know what the motive was to promote the terrorists and bring down the rule of law in the North. Police leave had been cancelled, but they are not in a position to implement law and order. On the other hand, 25% of Military presence was reduced in the North and around 100 Military camps are being removed in the North and East. In such a situation, Minister Vijayakala says she wants the LTTE back.
Weerawansa noted that the minister in a statement issued on Thursday, had admitted that she had violated the Constitution. On the other hand you (Speaker) are seeking the AGs advice on whether she had violated the Constitution, while she herself admits to having done so.
As such, does she have a right to remain an MP I dont say that it is wrong to talk about the rights of the Tamils. But it is not acceptable to allow her to promote terrorism. In response, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said once he received instructions from the Attorney General, he would convey them to the party leaders and would take a decision regarding Minister Vijayakala. I am not in a position to make a statement on the security situation prevailing in the North. The Prime Minister would do that. I have consulted the Attorney General regarding Minister Maheshwarans statement. However, I am not in a position to tell you if it would be today or next week, the Speaker said.
Delay in holding LG elections: Is govt. seriously committed to democracy: Opp. Leader
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan said the delay in holding elections is a serious issue which also raises the question of whether the governments in this country are seriously committed to democracy functioning in regard to provincial governance. He noted that it has been almost a century since the proposal was made for a system of governance that would enable the sharing of powers in regions or provinces to be able to exercise the power of governance.
Still, we have not been able to have in place a credible power sharing arrangement and to ensure that elections are held at the proper time. Since the enactment of the 13th Amendment to date, steps have been taken by every single president and government to enact the new Constitution which contains proposals in regard to provincial governance that went far beyond the 13th Amendment. One would ask why these successive governments have been unsuccessful. Perhaps, it was because they did not have a 2/3rd majority. Now with the joint government of the two major parties and the support of a majority, we are in a position to muster a 2/3rd majority, which would enable the enactment of a new constitution within an undivided and perpetually indivisible country that would put this problem to an end and give the country the freedom to move forward, he added.
The Opposition Leader said that our country had no future, unless there was a new Constitution.
Sampanthen, referring to the statement made by State Minister Vijayakala Maheshwaran, said, Understandably, all this is happening because there is no final resolution of the conflict and because we have not been able to frame a constitution which all could accept. People must be able to determine their destiny in the areas they live. Hence, he said democracy must be restored in the provinces and there must be early provincial council elections, as the tendency to give step motherly treatment to the provinces was unacceptable.
PC (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 must be repealed soon:Sumanthiran
The TNA demanded that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017 be repealed immediately, enabling the holding of Provincial Council Elections without further delay, if the government fails to bring in reforms for the Act within the next two months.
TNA MP MA Sumanthiran presenting the Adjournment Motion in Parliament yesterday, said, Terms of office of three Provincial Councils came to an end in October 2017, whereas no elections for the three said provincial councils have been conducted to date owing to the fact that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act was amended in order to introduce reforms to the electoral process, while three more provincial councils will end their respective terms of office by October 2018. No election to any Provincial Council could be held due to the fact that the electoral reforms are not yet complete. An urgent priority has arisen to complete electoral reforms, so the franchise of the people of several provinces is not denied any further. We urge the government complete the electoral reforms to the Provincial Councils election laws immediately without further delay. If it is not possible to complete the said reforms within the next two months, we urge that the Provincial Councils (Amendment) Act No. 17 of 2017, be repealed immediately so that elections to the provincial councils could be held without further postponement.
He noted that it was important to set out the background to the present situation. After the government took office in 2015, several reform processes were undertaken. There were important reforms to the Constitution that was pledged and in January 2016, a resolution was presented to Parliament to appoint a Constitutional Assembly and undertake that task of drafting a constitution for this country. That was adopted unanimously by this House on March 9, 2016. There were three important issues that were identified in that particular process. One was to address the national issue to finally settle the issue that had plagued this country for 70 years by proper devolution of powers to the provinces and secondly, to address the issue of the executive presidency and make a decision with regard to the pledges given to the country prior to every presidential election that the executive presidency would be abolished. Thirdly, to reform the electoral laws. Since 1978, this country had been using the proportional representation system and after several years, various shortcomings of this system were identified. Most important of them being that there is no member of Parliament who is accountable to a particular Constituency. They all represent a district and in that context, it is difficult to identify members who are accountable to the people of a particular constituency. Hence a promise was given that the electoral system would be reformed.
There were also allegations with reference to the preferential system, said Sumanthiran, adding that in that constitutional assembly process, the steering committee started discussing the reforms to the electoral process.
In those discussions, an alternate proposal was put forward known as the mixed member proportion (MMP) by which, it is meant to be an overall PR system, but within it you accommodate people who are elected from specific constituencies. In order to maintain that overall representation, a certain percentage of members were then appointed.
Hence, it was necessary to identify the ratio between those members who would be directly elected from these constituencies and those members who would be appointed as the compensatory PR so that the overall representation in Parliament would be in accordance with the vote that was cast by the people.
In those discussions, several models were examined and at one stage, there was a policy decision taken that parties were generally in agreement with the MMP with a 60-40 ratio. Sixty to come from constituencies directly, while the other 40 to be appointed so that the entire 100% would be proportionally representative.
Thereafter, there were various disputes with regard to details. Such as cut-off, bonus, etc. the Steering Committee left it as it was and moved on to discuss other issues, he said.
Sri Lanka, a veritable laboratory for testing out election systems:Minister Hakeem
Ever since adult franchise was introduced, the country had been having different systems of elections at different periods of time. Of late, we have come to a position where the country has virtually become a veritable laboratory for testing out election systems. None of these tests have become positive as the different concerns of the various segments and communities of the country could not be addressed, said the Leader of the Muslim Congress and Minister of City Planning and Water Supply Rauff Hakeem.
Joining in the Adjournment Motion on the Provincial Council Election system in Parliament yesterday, he said that the latest election system that was introduced was done very surreptitiously without the majority of the members knowing what they were going to do. All of a sudden on the pretext of introducing some amendments, which was originally in the Order Paper relating to women representation, an entirely new system of election was stealthily and surreptitiously introduced in the House, he said, adding that he was one of those who took firm objections to the process in which that provincial council election law was brought to the House and introduced.
We made several protests and having got some assurances from the Prime Minister that all concerns related to the minorities, especially the dispersed Tamil communities and the Muslims, who had some very serious issues pertaining to the new system, they agreed to even convert the proportion of first past the post electorates to that of the proportional representation of seats and the amended 60 - 40 was further amended to 50 - 50 and having observed what happened in the LG elections, it became very clear that the new system that was meant to get rid of the negative features, in fact further aggravated the existing situation. He said although the new system was designed to prevent the buying of votes, it in fact got worse. Electoral abuse had increased many fold despite the fact that these were to be addressed through a new system, he added.
Meanwhile, Hakeem said that they had only received a volume one of the delimitation reports that had been tabled. There is a further volume which is with various organisations in every district, while we were not provided with that second volume to ascertain if sufficient action had been taken by the delimitation committee to the observations and memoranda submitted by different organisations at district level. However, he said that the relevant period in which this report should have been debated, had now passed.
He noted that the delimitation committee had turned down in many places proposals made by his party for multi member electorates to accommodate minority representation in several areas. Hence, he proposed that the new system be completely ignored and revert to the older election system.
JVP wants new Delimitation Committee to reduce LG electoral wards
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, requested for the appointment of a new Delimitation Committee for Local Government bodies to reduce the number of electoral wards and thereby limit the total number of LG members to 5,000.
Taking part in the Adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday, the MP pointed out that an agreement had now been reached that the number of LG members, which increased to over 8,000 at the last LG elections, be reduced to 5,000.
The number of electoral wards have to be reduced to at least 3,000, if the number of members do not to exceed 5,000. For that, a new delimitation process is necessary. The President also recently commented that the number of LG members must be reduced, he said.Commenting on the claims that the new electoral system had led to instability in LG authorities, the MP pointed out that an electoral system could not assure stability if elected members are ready to switch sides for money. That could only be changed by creating a better political culture, he added. Today, politics is a profit-making business. You would realize this if you compare the living patterns and properties of politicians before and after being elected. The deterioration of political culture could not be concealed with whatever electoral system. A fair representation of peoples mandate is what is required by an electoral system, he observed.
Will govt. repay increased fuel prices
Chief Opposition Whip and JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, queried as to whether the Government would repay the consumers who bought fuel at increased prices from Thursday midnight until the sudden withdrawal of the decision from noon yesterday. He made this query, bringing to the attention of the House that the President had ordered to for the revoke of fuel price increase and had instructed to sell them at the previous rates. He asked for a clarification from the Government over the confusion and whether there had been Cabinet approval to increase the fuel prices. Petrol stations charged the new prices from consumers from midnight Thursday. Now the decision has been changed suddenly. Can the consumers get back the money they overpaid he questioned.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya directed the Chief Government Whip and Minister Gayantha Karunathilake to refer the question to Petroleum Industries Minister Arjuna Ranatunga.
JVP Leader irritated by Wimals theatrics
JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake and NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa locked horns in Parliament yesterday.
MP Dissanayake was interrupted by MP Weerawansa when he was drawing the attention of the House to the confusion on fuel price revisions.
With his mike off Weerawansa was heard singing aloud Ratakata oone apamana agayak and the Speaker immediately questioned who that was.
MP Dissanayake who was quick to respond to MP Weerawansa saying, We experience in this Parliament what happens when a person grows physically with a loud mouth, but when the brain does not grow, we need not bother about them. His is nothing but baby talk. He was making very immature comments just because he has a big mouth. Even school children are watching, he hit hard at Weerawansa.
MP Weerawansa then again tried to disturb MP Dissanayake asking for a point of order. An irate JVP Leader then said, I know your whole family is suffering from mental illnesses. You should be sent to a lunatic house. Shame on you.

Ping-pong diplomacy: N.Korea table tennis team heads South
Seoul, Friday: North Korea will play in a table tennis competition in South Korea this month, in the latest sign of warming ties between the Cold War rivals whose rapprochement owes much to sport.
North Korea, who competed in February's Winter Olympics in the South, will send a team for the Korean Open south of Seoul from July 17-22, the International Table Tennis Federation said.
"It is a proud moment for the ITTF to be able to support another sign of peace on the Korean Peninsula, by helping North Korea send a team to the Korean Open," said ITTF president Tomas Weikert.
North Korea's participation in the Winter Olympics set the stage for a rapid improvement in relations with both Seoul and Washington, culminating in last month's summit between Kim Jong-Un and US President Donald Trump in Singapore.
The two Koreas, who are still technically at war, bonded over table tennis as long ago as 1991, when they joined forces for the world championships in Japan and won the women's team event.
At the world team championships in May, North and South Korea were due to face each other in the women's quarter-finals -- but they were given permission to form a joint team instead, losing to Japan in the semi-finals.
"The momentous unified team at the 2018 World Table Tennis Championships... showed the world that countries can find peace on a table tennis table," Weikert said in a statement.
Only this week, about 50 men and women basketball players from South Korea played alongside North Koreans in combined teams in the North Korean capital Pyongyang.
The two sides are also discussing marching together at the opening ceremony of next month's Asian Games, where they will field joint teams in canoeing, rowing and women's basketball.

PM challenges MR to make statement on NYT report
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe challenged former President Mahinda Rajapaksa to make a statement on the New York Times (NYT) report in Parliament.
Speaking in Parliament yesterday, the Prime Minister said his Government ushered in media freedom and will protect it.
We are against threatening journalists. Going beyond intimidating and killing Sri Lankan journalists, now the New York Times Editor and others have been threatened and the paper has gone public with that, the Prime Minister said.
Replying to MEP Dinesh Gunawardena who charged that the Government was behind the New York Times report, the PM denied any Government involvement in it. We dont know. We didnt publish it, he said.
MP Gunawardena raising a question under the Standing Order 27 (2) accused the Government of tapping the phone calls received to media stations. He charged that media personnel and listeners of Neth FM had been intimidated. Replying to these concerns, the Prime Minister said the Kollupitiya Police has commenced an investigation over a news story carried on Neth FM programme Balumgala upon a complaint received from Deputy Minister Palitha Thewarapperuma. He said Police had recorded statements from two journalists who conducted the programme and had sought court permission to record statements from another three persons.
Police will submit a full report. The Government has not interfered in this incident. Media channels air this type of programmes because they have enough media freedom, he said. He also said that he would look into how Police received the telephone numbers of listeners, while observing that if Police is in possession of the relevant tape of the programme, it can easily find the numbers of listeners.

Project to produce fuel from plastic
Plans are underway to produce fuel out of plastic, polythene and discarded fishing nets, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources State Minister Dilip Vedaarachchi said, addressing the media, recently.
He said he will be able to introduce an alternative fuel variety to the fisher community with this project.
He added that the project will be implemented close to fisheries harbours in the island.
Fishermen engaged in deep sea fishing discard plastic bottles, polythene and old fishing nets in large quantities to the sea, polluting it in alarming proportions.
With the inauguration of the project, such things will be brought back and handed over to the respective fisheries harbours to produce fuel, he said. The State Minister added that as a result of dumping plastic polythene and old nets to the sea, the sea resources, including corals and fish get destroyed to a certain extent.
The State Minister said the service of SENORA and ministries will be obtained for the new project.
He added that he will conduct workshops to educate the fisher community engaged in deep sea fishing in muti-day boats regarding the new project.

Rejuvenating Co-operatives
Amidst the plethora of supermarkets coming up everywhere, there is one institution that is still surviving. This is the village co-operative society, which used to thrive some time back but has now taken a back seat thanks to the supermarket explosion and the retail banking boom. In fact, these are the very foundation of the co-operatives movement  retail sales at reasonable prices and micro-financing through the co-operative lending societies. The latter has now evolved into a bank under the name Sanasa, but it has to face tough competition from established retail banks.
The co-operative used to be the very foundation of a village  an entire village coming together for a good cause. It is a movement that values and promotes equality  you can be a member regardless of whether you are rich or poor and your vote has the same value. At a time when income inequality is rising around the world, it is good to be reminded that solutions to inequality do exist. The co-operative model is foremost among these solutions, since it contains aspects of sustainable development at its core and is based on ethical values and principles.
Co-operatives have been acknowledged as associations and enterprises through which citizens can effectively improve their lives while contributing to the economic, social, cultural and political advancement of their community and nation. Co-operatives open membership model affords access to wealth creation and poverty elimination. This results from the co-operative principle of members economic participation: Members contribute equitably to, and democratically control, the capital of their co-operative. Because co-operatives are people-centred, not capital-centred, they do not perpetuate, nor accelerate capital concentration and they distribute wealth in a more fair way.
On July 7 (today), members of co-operatives around the world celebrate the International Day of Co-operatives. Through the slogan for 2018 Sustainable Societies through cooperation they will show how, thanks to their values, principles and governance structures, co-operatives have sustainability and resilience at their core, with concern for community as the seventh of their guiding principles.
By their very nature, co-operatives play a triple role: As economic institutions they create opportunities for jobs, livelihoods and income generation; As people-centred enterprises with social goals they contribute to social equity and justice; As democratic institutions, they are controlled by their members, playing a leading role in society and local communities.
The co-operatives have come a long way since 1761when a group of local weavers formed the Fenwick Weavers Society in Scotland. In 1844 a group of 28 artisans working in the cotton mills in the town of Rochdale, in the north of England established the first modern co-operative business, the Rochdale Equitable Pioneers Society. The weavers faced miserable working conditions and low wages, and they could not afford the high prices of food and household goods. They decided that by pooling their scarce resources and working together they could access basic goods at a lower price. Initially, there were only four items for sale: flour, oatmeal, sugar and butter. This is widely regarded as the birth of the modern co-operative.
Today the sector is estimated to have around one billion members worldwide. Co-operatives employ, directly or indirectly, 250 million people around the world. The world's top 300 co-operatives by themselves have an estimated global turnover of US$ 2.53 trillion as revealed by the 2016 World Co-operative Monitor.
In Sri Lanka, The asset base of co-operatives has increased to nearly Rs three billion (US$ 18 million). There are almost 14,500 co-operatives in products, services, SMEs, women's development, rural banking, funeral services, insurance and farming sectors. Co-operatives are also present in the FMCG sector in Sri Lanka through Coop City shops run by the co-operatives Wholesale Establishment. The total membership exceeds five million.
The latter statistic shows the tremendous potential for co-operatives  it should not be difficult to enroll at least 2-3 million more members in co-operatives throughout the island. You can find out whether there is a co-operative society in your area and join it. It has the power to bring an entire town or village together for the areas uplift. The co-operative is often the most vital link in a disaster situation, as it can mobilize resources and personnel to distribute food and engage in relief efforts. Co-operative banks can boost the self-employed and SME sector through their rolling credit schemes.
The International Co-operative Alliance (ICA) recently recognized Sri Lankas co-operative sector by holding one of its main conferences in Colombo. This international spotlight should be used to highlight the achievements of our 112-year-old co-operatives sector. One vital factor pointed out at this parley was that co-operatives are no longer charitable organisations and they have to earn considerable revenue to meet their expenses for survival. Co-operatives also have to compete with other institutions in a liberal market economy. The onus is thus on co-operative societies to formulate proper strategic plans taking into consideration the market situation and competitiveness to sell their products, businesses and services. It is vital to strengthen the local co-operatives sector, which can help the countrys development efforts in a massive way.

The corruption case filed against former Minister and Kalutara District Parliamentarian Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the alleged unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million was yesterday re-fixed for trial on August 3 by the Colombo High Court.
When the case came up before High Court Judge Sampath Wijeratne, the court was informed through the Defence Counsel that Rohitha Abeygunawardena was not appearing in court since he was attending Parliament sessions.
On an earlier occasion, the High Court had overruled preliminary objections raised by the former Minister against the Bribery Commissions decision to amend the charges and decided to proceed with the trial.
The Director General of the Commission to Investigate Allegations of Bribery or Corruption had filed an indictment in the Colombo High Court on two counts against former Minister Rohitha Abeygunawardena for the unlawful acquisition of assets estimated at Rs.41.1 million.
In his indictment, the Director General of the Bribery Commission alleged that the former Minister had committed this offence by way of undeclared assets in between 2004 to 2006.
The Director General alleged that the former minister had unlawfully made 66 monitory transactions, constructed a house and purchased a jeep in contravention to the section 23(a) of the Bribery Act.
The Director General further alleged that former Minister had owned these properties-deems under the provision of the act to be property acquired by bribery.

Russia try to keep World Cup dream alive after miracle win
Moscow, Friday: Russia will try to keep their unlikely dream alive on Saturday when the host nation face Croatia in their first World Cup quarter-final since 1970.
It has been an enchanted summer for the worlds largest nation as it hosts the biggest event in sport.
Russias once-hapless team have suddenly turned into giantslayers who dispatched 2010 champions Spain in the last 16 and are now seriously contemplating reaching the July 15 final.
The World Cup itself has been blissfully free of the hooligan battles and racist monkey chants that blighted Russian domestic league and international matches.
And President Vladimir Putin has managed -- if only briefly -- to stem the tide of Western media criticism by presenting Russia as a fun-loving and welcoming place.
Many stereotypes about Russia have simply collapsed, Putin told a group of high-profile former players at a Kremlin reception on Friday.
European bookmakers still expect Croatia and their elegant midfielder Luka Modric to prevail in the quarter-final in the balmy Black Sea resort of Sochi.
But Russias players are exuding a breezy confidence that comes from having avoided the fiasco many fans had initially feared.
Even before the tournament started, we all knew we could reach the final, said star midfielder Alexander Golovin.
Now, we are seriously counting on it.
Through gritted teeth
Few Russians agreed with Golovin when they entered the tournament as its lowest-ranked nation and without a win in eight months.
A thumping start in which Russia scored eight goals in wins over Saudi Arabia and Egypt generated mostly surprise and relief.
A 3-0 loss to Uruguay that gave Russia the unenviable matchup with Spain was met with resigned shakes of the head from fans familiar with defeat.
But coach Stanislav Cherchesov worked up a rousing defensive effort against the Spaniards that pushed the match into extra time and eventual penalties with the score tied 1-1.
You have to know how to suffer, silver-haired midfielder Alexander Samedov said of the constant Spanish pressure.
We showed that we could.
A winning left-foot save from keeper Igor Akinfeev produced the moment of magic that brought fans from Kaliningrad to Kamchatka pouring out onto the streets in astonished glee.
Cherchesov and the players know they have already won over the nation and secured their place in Russian football history.
The coach and his masterful moustache have turned into an internet meme that has come to symbolise Russians love affair with their team that has defied the odds.
They are the first post-Soviet team to either make it out of a World Cup group or win a knockout game.
The hosts have played their hearts out and are probably not as big an underdog against Croatia as they were in the game they just won.
A victory on Saturday would see Russia face either England or Sweden in only their second World Cup semi-final since 1966.
Not too many Russians are optimistic enough to look that far ahead.
Just 17 percent told a state pollster they thought Russia could actually win the entire tournament -- about the same number as the day after their Saudi win.
Yet seven out of 10 say they now are watching matches and the atmosphere has grown more electric by the day.
Akinfeev said the opening game crowd in Moscows intimidating Luzhniki Stadium resembled a polite audience listening to a chamber orchestra.
Against Spain, the stadium breathed as one, the new hero said. We are nothing without their emotions. AFP

SAFMA - SL condemns targeting of Lankan journalists
The Sri Lanka chapter of the South Asian Free Media Association is very concerned about the targeting by politicians of two Sri Lankan journalists involved in internationally reporting on Sri Lankan issues published recently in the New York Times newspaper of the USA.
We are concerned that, due to this individual targeting, the professional sights of these journalists have been violated. We are also concerned that the targeting is being done by senior leaders of a political group that, when it was last in governmental power, presided over a regime that saw the collective intimidation and repression of the news media industry by extreme violence.
Singling out and publicly targeting individual professionals for the work they perform for an employer, in this case, an internationally published newspaper, is only valid if those individuals at least appeared to have seriously violated the countrys laws in any manner. In the case of the detailed news report published by the New York Times newspaper of the USA, headlined How China got Sri Lanka to cough up a port on June 25, 2018, the two Sri Lankan journalists concerned were the local support reporters for the American journalist team belonging to the New York Times.
The public naming of these two journalists last week remarkably echoed that period of repression and the behaviour of politicians that heralded such massive rights violations and violence. The fact that this political criticism has sparked off a wave of similar or even worse criticism of these two individual professionals via internet and social media is indicative of an attempt to intimidate Sri Lankas news professional community as a whole, a press release said yesterday.

Sharif sentenced to 10 years for corruption
Pakistans former Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif was sentenced in absentia to 10 years in prison by a corruption court in Islamabad Friday, lawyers said, dealing a serious blow to his partys troubled campaign ahead of July 25 elections.
(Sharif) has been awarded 10 years imprisonment and an eight million pound ($10 million) fine over the purchase of high-end properties in London, defence lawyer Mohammad Aurangzeb told AFP.
Prosecuting lawyer Sardar Muzaffar Abbas also said that the court had ordered the properties, in Londons exclusive Mayfair, be confiscated by the federal government. Sharif is currently in London, where his wife is receiving medical treatment for cancer. The verdict immediately raised questions over whether he would return to Pakistan.
He was ousted as Prime Minister by the Supreme Court last year following a corruption investigation.- AFP

A State Leader should have the experience of at least a PS member - Welgama
The person whom we select as the State Leader should have at least been a Pradeshiya Sabha Member before, Joint Opposition MP Kumara Welgama said.
Taking part in the adjournment debate in Parliament yesterday, the MP shot down former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksas presidential bids. With my years of experience, I would like to give a message to the people of this country and contemporary politicians.
Our prospective candidate as the State Leader should have been an MP before. Only such a person understands the peoples sufferings and mingles with the ordinary public. Only such a person has sufficient knowledge about the country and understands the problems faced by the people. He must have experience.
That is why I say it will be good for the country had our choice for the State Leader been at least a Pradeshiya Sabha member before, he stressed.
Freedom and democracy must be protected in the country.
Any citizen must have the right to life. All people should be able to sleep without fear. Otherwise we cannot have hopes for the countrys betterment. Any person, who has at least been a PS member before, knows this well. Please think about it. Otherwise the country will face dire consequences, he noted.
He also noted that Provincial Council bodies are in fact redundant and the Central Government and LG bodies are more than enough to run the administration of the country.
The PCs were created to placate India as well as some parties here.
They are while elephants and the money we spend on them is a waste, he commented.

Sweden stand in the way of Englands World Cup charge
REPINO, Thursday - Enthused by an exciting young squad and a potentially kind draw against Sweden in Saturdays quarter-final, England fans are starting to believe they can end a 52-year wait to win the World Cup.
But the obdurate Scandinavians have a habit of upsetting the odds, particularly against England, having lost just one of eight previous competitive meetings.
Confidence in England is soaring after the team ended a long wait to win a World Cup penalty shootout, squeezing past Colombia in a tense and bad-tempered last-16 tie in Moscow.
Wed like to bring it home, said England defender John Stones on Thursday. Id love to win a World Cup, England would love to win a World Cup.
Its been a long time since we last won it. We want to make people proud back home.
England, World Cup winners in 1966, have already won over a public disaffected by an early exit in Brazil four years ago and an embarrassing defeat to Iceland at Euro 2016.
Gareth Southgates men have been drawing more viewers for their matches in Russia than Mays royal wedding, with 23.6 million tuning in for the shootout against Colombia. Its great to see the support back home. Everyones getting behind us in their thousands, added the Manchester City player.
Im getting videos and pictures from my friends back home watching the game, in the pubs, wherever they are in the country.
With just a four-day turnaround to facing Sweden in Samara, though, England have little time to replenish their energy.
And while some are already making plans for a potential semi-final against hosts Russia or Croatia, Stones warned of complacency against Sweden.
I think if you say its an easy game in a quarter-final of a World Cup then you are pretty stupid to say that. Sometimes they can throw you, these teams.
They can go kind of under the radar, but there is no question they are a good team. They wouldnt be where they are if they werent.
Sweden have arguably faced a much tougher path to get to the last eight, eliminating the Netherlands and Italy in qualifying just to get to Russia and then emerging as winners of Group F as holders Germany crashed out. AFP

Thailand honours British diver
THAILAND: A British cave diver who helped find a missing football coach and 12 boys has been honoured by Thai authorities.
Robert Charles Harper was one third of the British cave diving team who found the 12 teenagers and their coach, who had been trapped in a Thai cave in pitch darkness without food or water for nine days by monsoon rains.
Rescuers are still trying to save the group - who may have to dive more than a mile to safety.
Harper, from Wells in Somerset, received a warm farewell at Suvarnabhumi Airport and was given a certificate of appreciation by Thailand's tourism and sports minister as he left the country.
He departed earlier than the other divers involved in the operation, Rick Stanton and John Volanthen, due to a medical appointment.
The trio were were sent by the British Cave Rescue Council, who had been contacted by Thai authorities to come to the aid of the missing team.
Stanton and Volanthen led the party, and were the first to discover the boys after diving through a chamber to where they were perched above the water.
In footage of the discovery a light is cast on the faces of the trapped boys, while a rescuer with an English accent is heard trying to reassure the group that help is coming.
He warns, however, that the rescue attempt is far from over.
With the boys still trapped in the cave system experts are working round the clock to get them out - a rescue that has involved pumping out gallons of water.
The team have received messages of support from well-wishers around the world - including those who have direct experience of being trapped underground.
Mario Sepulveda, who was rescued from a mine in Chile in 2010, recorded a video message saying he had faith the boys would be rescued. - SKY NEWS

## Title: Threat of fascism takes new leap with Vijayakala
## Supertitle:

Threat of fascism takes new leap with Vijayakala
The threat of fascism has taken a new twist with UNP State Minister for Child Affairs Vijayakala Maheswaran taking the focus away from the religious and pious advise to Gotabhaya Rajapaksa to live up to the Hitler name that he is associated with. It has also pushed aside to some extent the troubles faced by Mahinda Rajapaksa and the SLPP over the report in the New York Times about Chinese funding for the MR Presidential race in January 2015. It is the new spin of politics in the country, which is raising major issues for both the Government and the Opposition, drawing both influential foreign forces and the divisions of internal politics into the conundrum of governance in Sri Lanka.
The news of the resignation of Austin Fernando from the office of Secretary to the President, turns another light to the many controversial issues of governance that has dominated public interest in the past few months; with the revelations from the Bond Scam moving beyond what was expected from that probe. They are not confined to the UNP, Arjun Mahendran and related conflicts of interest, but extending the recipients of perpetually crooked generosity, embracing both the UNP and SLFP, and certainly many others in elevated quarters of governance.
Vijayakala has gleefully waded into the politics of hatred with her call for the renewal of the LTTE. It could hardly be a slip of the tongue as she says, but a deliberate thought on what she, and possibly others in Tamil politics too, think of the status of ethnic politics in the country. In fact, although not stated so directly, the Northern Province Chief Minister Vigneswaran has also made several public statements that held high the role of the LTTE in the cause of Tamil people and politics. What has now happened, is that a Minister of State of the UNP-led Government, praising the LTTE terrorist leader, and looking for the return for those Prabhakaran Tamil Tiger decades to serve the needs of the Tamil people. The attack is certainly directed against the UNP, and in the current political context it is hardly the stuff that Ranil Wickremesinghe would want to face.













Vijayakala Maheswaran
Vijayakala should also consider the recent tearful farewell the Tamil people of Vishvamadu gave to Col. Ratnapriya Bandu of the of the Civil Security Department, who worked for the rehabilitation of former LTTE cadres, which shows a different attitude among Tamils who had served under the LTTE, by force or conviction, in those hard decades of a terrorist war. This shows there are other aspects of Tamil thinking, and understanding of the situation under the LTTE, which is far removed from Vijayakala, and still has hopes for genuine reconciliation.
Spur to racist forces
Her statement, apart from its highly questionable content and deserving of the strongest criticism, is the stuff that is ideal to spur the racist thinking among both Tamils and Sinhalese, and arouse majoritarian forces among the Sinhalese, seen take place in Parliament, and the statements issued by many political and religious personalities and organisations, calling for her removal from office  as State Minister, and possibly from Parliament too.
The use of Vijayakala for that terrible mockery of parliamentary procedure this week, was in fact a larger show of the failure of the content of democracy in this country, although we are the oldest democracy in Asia, and the oldest Asian Parliament. The criticism of Vijayakala by UNP Ministers and backbenchers too, and the quick action by the Speaker to refer the matter to the Attorney General, was the ideal situation to move a Motion in Parliament against her performance, and take it to the proper legal consequences.
What happened instead was a total distortion of the parliamentary process, which raises many questions about the parties and candidates that desire to be chosen by the people at the coming elections. It also poses a major question about the substance of democracy in the country, and whether we are heading away from the goals of democracy.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe and the UNP will have to work with speed to take the necessary disciplinary procedure against Vijayakala. There will be rising calls for her removal from Parliament, on the alleged matter of violating the Constitution. This must be left to the Courts to decide with speed, and not become a delay by recusals, leading to increased concerns about the independence of the Judiciary.
Vijayakala has also raised questions about the success of the yahapalana policies in bringing about post-war reconciliation, which should worry both President Sirisena and the Prime Minister; and also concerns about the moves towards fascism in the country, which needs serious consideration.
The fascist message
Sri Lankas worries about fascism is not confined to the individual  Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, who is known as Hitler (and not denied)  but also to a wider trend in the world, especially in the West, where the rise of populism is showing increasing signs of a possible return to the fascism that led to World War II and could push back the post-war democratic progress in the West. it is interesting to note that Gotabhaya Rajapaksa himself had referred to the news about the call for Hitlerism led by him to be fake news, which is the very stuff of Donald Trump, who is himself showing strong trends of anti-democratic policies, much closer to fascism.
Vijayakalas call for a return of the LTTE, will certainly give more strength to the voices of those who see the need for a renewed authoritarian governance in Sri Lanka, which is the very stuff of the Rajapaksa Regime that was defeated by the people more than three years ago. While the populism, especially in Europe is against immigration, and moving to major restrictions on immigrants and their children by the US today, the fascist rise here has all indications of being against minorities  both ethnic and religious, and economic development that is business driven and not social and public driven.
The authoritarian  pro-fascist  message gets stronger with the publicized meeting of the Rajapaksa brotherly trio  Mahinda, Gotabhaya and Basil -this week, with the necessary religious rituals, and the statement by Mahinda Rajapaksa that Gotabhayas Viyath Maga was in keeping with the Mahinda Chinthanaya. It would be interesting to know which edition of the Mahinda Chinthanaya is the stuff of the Viyath Maga. Is it in the promotion of business interests of the money makers of the Rajapaksa Regime, and does it accept the abolition of the Executive Presidency, but would add to its powers and unlimited continuance as Mahinda did
Those limited voices against the Heil Arya Sinhala Gota Hitler forces, who are having some impact in the media, but show little success within the Joint Opposition and the Rajapaksa political retinue, must have some cause for concern because the publicity for the Rajapaksa brotherly gathering did not give any place to the fourth brother, Chamal, promoted by these non-Gota voices as the likely choice for the presidential candidate.
The refusal to reject fascism by the Hitler namesake, and the many moves being made to say the call by the Anunayaka Thera of the Asgiriya Chapter for a Hitler-led military awakening to build this country was a call for a religious righteousness in national leadership, continues to ring hollow in the wider public mind. But, the realities of politics and the decline in the democratic process and democratic thinking, certainly gives much cause for concern about the revival of a dictatorial family trend in the country.
Ports of political worry
The loud rejections by the Rajapaksa forces of material in the recent New York Times of a Chinese company, engaged in port building in Sri Lanka, funding the Mahinda Rajapaksa presidential election bid, does not take the story away.
The very mention of the details of a government investigation seen by the writer (and associates) of this story, places a burden on the Government to come out with everything it has on this Sino-Lankan political crookedness. The name of the bank that issued the cheques is given, so the probe cannot be difficult for any authority.
There can be no question the NYT could have given priority to its anti-Chinese and pro-American interests in this story. That is part of international relations. But, those affected are us in Sri Lanka. It is thus necessary for people here to know the truth about these allegations, and how much these may have contributed to the Chinese economic impact on this country. Also, the efforts by members of the JO to threaten the local journalists who contributed to this story needs the strongest condemnation in support of Media Freedom.
This exposure underscores the need for urgent and careful action, by legislation to control the funding of all elections in the country, whether from Perpetual crooks here, or Chinese or any other companies engaged in whatever development projects.
The strengthening of Democracy, demands Clean Elections  away from manipulative and crooked funding of politicians and political parties.

US judge orders Brazilian mother, son to be reunited
US: A Brazilian migrant woman was reunited Thursday with her son after a US judge ordered the 10-year-old released from a Chicago shelter.
The child was among more than two thousand children separated from parents at the US-Mexico border due to a zero tolerance immigration approach under which adults were prosecuted and their children taken away.
Sirley Paixao had sued the US government on Monday to regain custody of her son Diego. The two had spent more than a month apart after they illegally crossed the southern US border seeking asylum.
A federal judge in Chicago ordered Diego's release, citing the likelihood of irreparable harm. The two were reunited soon after, according to US media reports.
Plaintiffs have demonstrated some likelihood of success on their claim that continued separation of (Diego) from his available, fit parent violates their due-process rights, US District Court Judge Manish Shah said in a written ruling.
After their reunion, mother and son were headed to stay with relatives or friends in Boston while Paixao's asylum request is processed, US media reported.
I'm very, very happy, Paixao told news media through an interpreter after the court hearing.
He's going to be right by my side, and he's not going to go anywhere ever again, she said.
The reunion came as the Donald Trump administration disclosed that it had resorted to DNA testing on up to 3,000 detained migrant children who remain separated from their parents, in order to reunite families by court-imposed deadlines.
The Department of Health and Human Services has been ordered to reunite some 100 children under the age of five with their parents by next Tuesday and other children by July 26. - AFP

Vijayakala cannot be branded as terrorist: Vigneswaran
Northern Chief Minister C.V. Vigneswaran said that when Tamils speak about their security and rights, the south should not look at that as a threat.
He said Vijayakala Maheswaran cannot be branded as a terrorist for expressing her opinion that the North was much safer under Prabhakaran.
It is a world known fact that Tamils in the North were safe under Prabhakaran and nobody can disagree with that. Anyone who wants to comment about the prevailing security in the North and compare it with the past, they have the right to do that, he said.
The Chief Minister said he was at the meeting but could not hear all what she said due to some problems with the speaker. He said he later questioned Maheswaran and learnt what she actually meant.
All she wanted to say was that the prevailing situation in the North has to be changed.
I dont understand what make people in the South think that it was wrong, he said.
The Chief Minister said that during the war, even women wearing gold jewellery were able walk alone at night on the road without fear.
He said there is a drastic increase in illegal activities and crimes in the North and added that it can be controlled only if the government remove the army and give the police power to the Tamil people. I tell the government to give us the police power, so we will sort out all the prevailing issues in North, he said.
He said the attack was not actually against Vijayakala Maheswaran but against the Tamils as a whole.

When Muralitharan woke Sangakkara up to watch cartoons together
Muthiah Muralitharan and Kumar Sangakkara revealed some little-known facts about each other during the third season of Vius What The Duck, television series hosted by Vikram Sathaye.
Murali, for example, informed that He [Sanga] collects things and he loves doing that. He will collect watches, whiskeys and all the drinks. But the only thing he doesnt like collecting is trophies. He throws them away or gives it to people. He doesnt have a single trophy. All of them have been given away to people.
Mahela Jayawardene had previously gone on record and said that Murali and Sanga are often involved in light-hearted banter in topics ranging from politics to current affairs to cricket.
Sanga responded to the statement: I think Mahela is the one who is arguing constantly with everyone. This is a fact, he wants to be right all the time. Not very different from Murali as well though. It is said that Sanath Jayasuriya is the most connected man in Sri Lanka, I say it is Murali who knows anything and everything about Sri Lanka! So you can talk to him about cricket, business, real estate, anything in life, he will answer.
Murali quipped in as well: Or you pretend to know everything. You cant say No. No answer is the worst answer to give anybody. You know a few points here and there and then take it expanding it a little bit. Then whether one buys it or not its up to them!
The pair has often shared rooms on tours, and had some curious experiences. Sanga shared his experiences: He loves his TV. I love it too, but Murali will wake me up from my sleep. I used to play along at first. But then even though Im pretending to be sleeping, he will call out to me and make sure that I watch the cartoon along with him. So I get up and have to keep watching cartoons with him in the room.
Murali spoke on Sanga and Mahelas phenomenal 624-run partnership against South Africa: They know they cant get out and come into the dressing-room early. I will give the bamboo to them. All the batsmen were scared because I always want a big score. Hence they remain in the field.
Sanga added: The partnership was an accident. We barely spoke about batting and were mostly talking about other things like eating for the two days.
That was actually the first time we spoke about retirement. Because when we saw South Africans on the field for two days, so we thought this cant happen to us. So for us best thing is to retire with Murali.

When No.11 batsman scored one run in a century partnership
Top order batsmen usually take the strike and do the bulk scoring while batting along with No.11 batsman who are rarely seen doing the same along with fellow lower-order players. In one such instance on Tuesday, a No.10 showed complete dominance in the partnership with the last man standing in a County match. Kent batsman Grant Stewart who walked in at No.10 scored a brilliant century against Middlesex by batting out with the No.11 player Ivan Thomas. The pair added exactly 100 runs for the 10th wicket out of which Thomas scored just one run.
Kent posted 241 in the first innings and bundled out the opponents to just 56 and decided to bat again. Kent lost their 9th wicket in the 2nd innings on 181 while Stewart was batting on eight runs. The century partnership came in exactly 100 balls lasting 63 minutes before Stewart holed out scoring 103 in 74 balls that included 13 fours and five sixes. Thomas remained unbeaten on one run off 36 balls as Kent set a target of 467 for the visitors. Stewart scored 95 out of the 100-run stand with four more runs coming off leg-byes.
Thus, Ivan Thomas became only the 2nd player to score as little as one run in a century partnership in first-class cricket. Dilhara Fernando scored one run off 23 balls before getting run out during the 2004 Faisalabad Test against Pakistan.
He shared a 101-run partnership for the 9th wicket with Sanath Jayasuriya in the 2nd innings out of which the opening batsman scored 88 runs while the remaining 12 were extras.
The Australian born Grant Stewart planted himself too in the history books becoming the first Kent No.10 batsman to score a century in FC cricket. Stewart was clinical with the ball in the first innings as he took 6/22 in his 10 overs to keep Middlesex down to a low total.
Thus, Stewart became the first player in the last 90 years to take a 6-wicket haul and score a century in the same county championship game for Kent.
He contributed 95% of runs in that 10th wicket stand which is the 2nd highest contribution by any player in a century partnership in first-class history.

Which records got shattered in 2018 FIFA World Cup
The 2018 FIFA World Cup is almost nearing its climax.
With just 6 more games left, before the final, the excitement is surely heating up.
Several records have been broken in this edition of the tournament including the longest start without a goalless draw which came in the 37th game.
Here we take a look at the records that were shattered in this edition.
MOST PENALTY GOALS IN A SINGLE WORLD CUP 21 GOALS
The introduction of the controversial technology 'Video Assistant Referee' has seen the increase in the number of penalty goals scored in this edition of the World Cup.
In the 2014 FIFA World Cup, in Brazil, 13 penalties were awarded.
However, this time around, in first 56 matches that have been played so far, a total of 21 goals have been scored via penalties.
FIRST MANAGER TO APPEAR IN FOUR EDITIONS WITH SAME TEAM OSCAR TABAREZ
Uruguay boss Oscar Tabarez created his own piece of history by becoming the first manager to appear in four World Cups with the same team.
The 2018 edition in Russia is Tabarez's fourth as the manager of Uruguay and third consecutive tournament.
The 71-year-old master tactician is also the oldest manager at the 2018 FIFA World Cup.
OLDEST PLAYER IN A WORLD CUP GAME ESSAM EL-HADARY
At 45 years and 161 days, Egypt's goal-keeper Essam El-Hadary became the oldest player to feature in a World Cup fixture when he took the field against Saudi Arabia. This is also his debut tournament.
He broke the record, which was earlier held by 43-year-old Colombian custodian Faryd Mondragon.
Faryd had achieved this feat during the 2014 FIFA World Cup.
OLDEST PLAYER TO SCORE A HAT-TRICK CRISTIANO RONALDO
Cristiano Ronaldo made sure he etched his name in the history books when he scored a hat-trick in Portugal's opener against Spain.
Ronaldo's feat ensured he became the oldest player to score 3 goals in a single game, at the premier tournament. He achieved the feat aged 33 years and 131 days breaking Rob Rensenbrink record of 30 years and 336 days.

Wimbledon 2018: Why tennis players have to wear white
The Wimbledon Championships, the biggest fixture on the professional tennis calendar, is a tournament thats heavily embedded in tradition.
Dating all the way back to 1877, one of the most distinctive features of the esteemed sporting competition is the very strict dress code thats imposed on the players who take part. Its a well-known fact that all participants must wear all-white outfits when they walk onto the court.
However, theres more to the guidelines than simply wearing an ensemble thats devoid of all colour. Players must be careful about the specific shade of white that they wear, as clothes that are off-white or cream in colour are not permitted. Furthermore, the tournament outlines very specific rules about the amount of colour thats allowed when featured on necklines, the cuffs of sleeves or headbands. Strips of colour can be no wider than a single centimetre, and logos on clothing that consist of patterns are not allowed.
So, where did the all-white dress code at Wimbledon come from Heres everything you need to know:
THE HISTORY OF THE DRESS CODE
The notion of tennis whites dates back to the 1800s, when people would play tennis at social events.
Players wore white in order to avoid sweat patches appearing on coloured clothing, as explained in Tennis Fashions: Over 125 Years of Costume Change by Valerie Warren.
One problem which simply had to be addressed very early on was that of perspiration, she wrote.
As increased skill at the game led to more movement on court, this in turn led to the dreaded problem of perspiration causing the appearance of embarrassing damp patches on coloured fabrics.
According to Warren, the rule was imposed specifically with women in mind as it was quite unthinkable that a lady should be seen to perspire.
THE WIMBLEDON RULES
In 2014, Wimbledon issued a 10-part decree of new rules that players had to follow when dressing for their matches to supplement the all-white guideline that had already been in existence.
The decree included a number of new rules that players had to follow, including the specific shade of white that they're allowed to wear.
However, it went even further, specifying the exact measurement of colour that competitors are permitted to wear while competing at SW19. The rules now state that only a "single trim of colour" that's no wider than one centimetre is allowed on the neckline, the cuff of sleeves, on headbands and on underwear. The tournament also imposed stricter rules on visible undergarments, outlining that any underwear that's visible during play must be strictly wide.
This guideline also extends to accessories such as caps, headbands, bandanas, wristbands and shoes, which includes the soles.
Former Wimbledon champion Pat Cash vehemently chastised the competition for its austere rules the same year that the updated guidelines were announced, after he was forced to pull out of the veterans' competition on account of his shoes. He described the dress code as "archaic thinking", stating that he believes the rules were put into place in order to force the women to play without underwear. The US Open used to have an all-white dress code as well. However, this was changed in 1972 to allow coloured clothing.
The French Open is similarly liberal when it comes to its dress code. However, Tennis Australia imposes slightly stricter rules on the players who participate in the Australian Open. While playing in the tournament, competitors must wear "acceptable tennis attire", which includes wearing headwear that has been deemed as suitable by the umpire. Only one logo is allowed on each sleeve of the players' tops and any logos or designs on headwear must be "tennis specific".  The Independent

Home Affairs Deputy Minister J. C. Alawathuwala said state media is now behaving in a better manner than during the time of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The responsibility of media personnel is to disseminate accurate facts on the countrys economic and political situation, he said. He added that an impartial analysis and proper understanding of a situation is necessary for reporting and most provincial media personnel have that ability.
Today, journalists have the freedom to write their opinions without fear. It is the duty of journalists to point out shortcomings of their localities to the government to correct wrongs. They help in the countrys development, he said.

SAITM students qualifications are obscure
The University Grants Commission (UGC) has informed the State Medical Students Parents Union that it does not have information in connection with the educational qualifications of the SAITM students, Media Spokesman of the Union Wasantha Alwis said.
He was addressing the media in Colombo yesterday.
He said the union sent a letter to the UGC under the Right to Information Act demanding information of the SAITM students. Responding to the request, the UGC has sent a letter stating that the union should obtain information from the SAITM.
The union demanded information on the number of students enrolled to the SAITM from the GCE A/L Science Stream results, the number of students who have one C pass and two S passes, and the number of students with one S pass or more.
Certain high officials in the Defence Ministry and certain public servants are allegedly making efforts now to enroll their unqualified children ito any medical faculty. Those officials threaten scholars who try to safeguard standard of the KDU, he said.

All eyes on Froome at epic Tour de France
Paris, Thursday: A relieved Chris Froome embarks on the long-awaited Tour de France on Saturday but an army of detractors, an array of talented rivals and a course that doesn't suit him stand in the way of a record-equalling fifth title.
Organisers lifted a ban on Froome taking part in the race on Monday after he was finally cleared by cycling's world governing body of doping suspicions linked to his use of asthma medication.
A bullish Froome said he was relieved to be back on course for a record-equalling fifth title but organisers felt the need to warn against violence along the three-week course and issue a plea to spectators to respect Froome and his Sky Team, which remains unpopular in France.
Froome however was roundly booed on his first meeting with the French public on Thursday when Sky took the stage for the official teams presntation here, and during a 1km jaunt around the small town of La Roche-sur-Yon.
Officials have drafted in around 30,000 agents to cope with security concerns and deal with the ever-present risk of terrorism as well as protecting the riders.
"I'm just relieved to be racing, and want to draw a line in the sand now," Froome said as his team boss Dave Brailsford added that Sky were used to negativity in France where Froome had been jeered and doused with urine in the past. Froome said earlier that a huge weight had been lifted off his mind after the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) dropped the case against him triggered last September by an adverse analytical finding (AAF) for salbutamol during the Tour of Spain. The three-week Tour is, as Irish fancy Dan Martin described, "a tale of two halves" this year with a flattish first part featuring treacherous cobbles and crosswinds followed by six mountain and four hilly stages packed into the latter part of the 3,351 kilometres (2,082 miles).
Cobbled roads
Whatever added tests facing Froome, route designer Thierry Gouvenou said the switch between the flat and the mountains "is perhaps the greatest challenge of this Tour".
Huge crowds are expected as the race sets off from France's Atlantic coast and early challenges include an agenda setting 35km team time trial on day three, while a run to the pretty seaside town of Quimper on day five features 10 hills.
There are two ascents of the feared Mur de Bretagne on stage six, and the day before the switch comes the feared cobbled road to Roubaix.
There are more than 20km of roughly hewn cobbles along old mining roads, and cycling folklore has it that the cobbles themselves choose their victims.
Britain's Mark Cavendish, who has 30 stage wins, said it was the hardest Tour de France route he'd ever seen and doubted he'd make it to the mountains.
The race lacks the kind of long, flat individual time trial where four-time winner Froome often pulverises his opponents, programming instead a medium size time-trial in the mountains where a string of climbers who would usually lose time to Froome may actually beat him.

Audit Bill: New feather in Govts cap
Finally, the National Audit Bill, a key public finance legislation that many awaited eagerly and even fought for, sailed through Parliament this week ending years of dilly-dallying and bargaining.
True, the Bill has been watered-down considerably compared to its earlier drafts that had been passing to and fro between the Legal Draftsman and the Cabinet not only during the last three years but also for the last 15 years since 2003, the year the Cabinet approved the first draft of National Audit Bill.
It was an onerous task for the Government to strike a balance between the powers of Sri Lanka Administrative Service Officials and Audit Officials, as it had to make sure that the Ministry Secretaries powers are not infringed upon while the Audit Commission headed by the Auditor General wields considerable power.
The Bill passed in to law with amendments, even including several proposed by the JVP and the SLFP, receiving unanimous consent of the House on Thursday. Auditor General Gamini Wijesinghe, along with other senior officials of his Department, remained in the Parliament complex throughout the debate.
The Bill seeing the light of the day preserving its spirit was another feather in Governments cap despite the repeated setbacks it has come across in many other fronts. The long-overdue Audit Bill was a key pre-election pledge of Common Candidate Maithripala Sirisena. JVP Parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti reminded that the Bill should have been passed in Parliament on March 19, 2015, had the Government been serious on its 100-day work programme.
Democratic structures in place
This historic piece of legislation was moved for debate by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The Bill provides for the powers, duties and functions of the Audit Service Commission. It also provides for the establishment of the National Audit Office and the Sri Lanka State Audit Service. It specifies the role of the Auditor General over public finance.
Moving the Bill, the PM rejoiced that the major reforms the Government had brought in since 2015 have put a total democratic structure in place that the people have started to enjoy their freedoms in all aspects.
All independent commissions, Judicial Services, Election, Public Service, Police and now Audit Service have been established. The Constitutional Council is functioning. The Right to Information law is enacted. With all these legislation we have put a democratic structure into place where the administration and judiciary can function without coming under undue political pressure. There will be shortcomings. We can correct those. This Parliament is becoming more and more powerful and as we go along we will have a Parliament which we can be proud of and would be on par or even better than the Lok Sabha in India, the Premier said.
Surcharge provision
JVP Parliamentarian Handunnetti expressed his satisfaction that the draft Bill, which had been left to lie idle since 2003-2015, ultimately found its way to Parliament because of the perseverance of this Government, Auditor General and the staff. The MP, who works closely with the Auditor General as the Head of COPE, presented the Audit Bill as a Private Members Bill in November last year when the Government was seen bidding more time. Pointing at several loose ends of the Bill, he said his party has proposed 16 amendments to empower and preserve the true spirit of the legislation and urged the Government to consider them at the third reading.
With the passage of the Audit Bill, the Audit Service Commission, which had been inactive for over two and half years since its birth after the 19th Amendment to the Constitution, will spring into life. The Commission with its new found teeth will be able to keep tabs on public accounts helping to curb the public sector corruption.
The Audit Bill was revised for over 23 times mainly due to contention over its surcharge provision which provides for a recovery of an amount overpaid to a public servant, or a recoupment of any loss caused to Government for which that officer is held responsible. This provision has been diluted to vest the authority to impose surcharge back in the Chief Accounting Officers (Ministry Secretaries/Department Heads), and not the Auditor General. In cases where the CAO has been implicated, the power to impose the surcharge lies with the Treasury Secretary. A Surcharge Appeal Committee comprising of five members will be appointed by the Constitutional Council to hear and determine appeals by any person against whom a surcharge has been imposed.
Vijayakala under fire
Much has been said in Parliament to condemn and haul ex-State Minister Vijayakala Maheswaran over the coals for her apparently ill-advised statement reportedly on reviving the LTTE in the North. Both Government and Opposition members came up strong against her statement showing rare unity demanding tough action against her.
The first salvo against her was fired by the UNP, despite her being a member of the same party. This was not the first time, Vijayakala, widow of slain ex-MP T. Maheswaran, uttered sentiments that glorified the LTTE. Like some rabble-rousing politicians in the South who pander to chauvinistic feelings of the Sinhala conservative voters, her remarks could be understood as pandering to communal feelings of the Tamils in the North mostly to win their hearts and thereby translate them into votes. This time around her words cost her dearly as she had to step down from her post pending disciplinary inquiries by the UNP hierarchy and the Speaker.
Both Government and Opposition members were on the same page that she, in the first place, should not have made such a statement that rekindled bitter past memories of ruthless terrorism that brought misery to many people across ethnic divisions. Another allegation against the UNP Jaffna District MP was that she breached the oath taken by MPs not to directly or indirectly support, espouse, promote, finance, encourage or advocate separatism.
UNP General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam was quick to distance his party from the controversial statement, while the TNA was cautious not to get into the controversy. Thus the TNA avoided having to deal with a political minefield.
JOs theatrics
With Child Affairs State Minister Maheswaran at the centre of controversy, it was a happening day in Parliament on Tuesday as Joint Opposition MPs, who were waiting in the wings to play their Tiger card, got back to their antics in Parliament. They staged a protest by storming the Well of the House forcing the Speaker to abruptly end the sittings by 2.25 pm, barely one and half hours since the sittings began.
For the JO, remarks on resurgence of LTTE came at a time it was desperately looking for a bait to distract the public and media attention from the recent blows it suffered from the New York Times investigative report as well as the controversial Hilter comment. While the Government took time to use the trump cards on its hand, the JO grabbed Vijayakalas remarks from both hands and created a lot of hype. It also helped the JO to keep its internal fissures out of the glare of the public eye at least temporarily.
Interestingly, JO Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena did not show much interest throughout the protest and mostly idled near his seat. This was contrary to his usual behaviour in the House, but it was difficult to construe the reasons for his sudden change.
It was NFF Leader Wimal Weerawansa who led the protest in the Well of the House, and he together with MP Prasanna Ranaweera made a lot of ugly scenes drawing the ire of the Speaker. They shouted slogans and hurled abuse at the Chair. Both Weerawansa and Ranaweera repeatedly defied the orders of the Speaker and behaved aggressive. SLFP Group of 16 members Dayasiri Jayasekara and Chandima Weerakkody were also in the forefront arguing with the Speaker.
Grabbing the Mace
The Speaker came to a head when MP Ranaweera tried to grab the Mace and run. The Serjeant-at-Arms, along with his Deputy and Assistant, prevented the MP from running with the Mace and a few UNP back-benchers also came to their support. The Speaker at this point named MP Ranaweera and ordered him out of the main chamber. As MP Ranaweera did not obey, he ordered the Serjeant-at-Arms to remove him, but Parliament was adjourned before the order was executed.
The provision to impose four weeks suspension on any member who touches the Mace during the sittings has been included into the new set of Standing Orders adopted from April 15. In addition, a Code of Conduct for MPs has also been adopted. If these rules and regulations are limited to books and left on tables to gather dust, one can expect the current trend of misbehavior to continue further humiliating the August Assembly. MP Ranaweera was suspended from Parliament for a week in May 2016 for his involvement in a brawl and he had been at the centre of similar in-house brawl in January this year.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe tackled the LTTE revival claims head on when he addressed Parliament the next day. While assuring to uphold sovereignty of the country, the Premier reiterated the Governments commitment to reach a political solution acceptable to all communities in the country. Those who question Maheswaran today, appointed ex-LTTE frontline leader Karuna Amman as SLFP office bearer, and sent former Army Commander Sarath Fonseka to jail. What is the moral right they have to make a fuss over this statement, the PM queried in lighter vein.

Bending it like Beckham, Trippier is Englands secret weapon
REPINO, Thursday - When Gareth Southgates England World Cup squad was announced, plenty of observers wondered how the team would be able to compensate for the absence of a genuine creative midfielder.
Who would create the chances for the talented collection of forward players, in particular centre-forward Harry Kane
The answer in Russia has proven to be, for some, an unlikely one: right-back Kieran Trippier.
Indeed not only has the Spurs wide-man provided a much-needed solution for England, he has also been one of the tournaments top performers.
According to statistics by Opta, the top three creators of chances in this tournament are Brazils Neymar, Belgiums Kevin De Bruyne and Trippier.
Somebody mentioned that to me  not bad for a Bury lad! laughed Trippier, referencing his hometown, near Manchester.
The (England) formation is perfect for me.
I can get forward as much as I can and try to get the crosses in and help my team as much as I can. If I manage to help them I am delighted, he said.
Trippier has always been a very attack-minded full-back, right from his days in Manchester Citys youth team, to his time with Burnley under Sean Dyche, and then under Mauricio Pochettino at Tottenham.
But in Southgates system, with three central defenders including right-sided Kyle Walker to offer cover, Trippier is so advanced he spends a large part of the game operating basically as a right-winger.
It is a little bit different to the way I play for Tottenham.
If one wing-back is higher, the other one tucks back just to make it four at the back.
Tactically it is different, but Gareth tries to encourage me to go forward as much as I can, to create as much as I possibly can.
He is a really positive manager, I cant speak highly enough of him, he said.
The housing estate where Trippiers family live is well-known for the 20-foot flagpole with a St Georges flag emblazoned with the full-backs name that the players father Chris put in his garden.
There is also a giant television where family and friends have been able to watch the games from Russia, including Tuesdays win over Colombia, which featured Trippier scoring in the shoot-out.
They were all in the garden watching it. Ive seen the videos of them going crazy when (Eric) Dier scored the winning penalty.
Theyre delighted and very proud and cant wait to get out here, he said.
My neighbours actually came round - quite a lot of them! They were watching over the hedges. Quite a few, my Dad was surprised people were walking past on the estate and watching it, then walking off. Just enjoying it.
Thats the estate were on, he said.
Trippiers family will be in Samara for the quarter-final against Sweden.
My family will come out for that.
Well have people watching out for the house and maybe keep the telly on for people to watch, he joked. As well as his tireless running down the flanks, speed and directness, Trippiers main quality is his ball-striking, both from set-pieces and crosses from wide areas.
It is an element of his game he worked on hard as a young player with then Manchester City youth team coach Steve Eyre.
When I was at City, at Platt Lane, in the youth team, near enough every day after training, we just used to stay out and practice and practice.
There are a lot of people I need to thank for my journey to get here and hes, for sure, one of them.
Trippier also studied the delivery techniques of some of the finest in the game.
I used to watch (David) Beckham and (Andrea) Pirlo, players like that, over their careers.
Beckham was the one I always looked up to - the technique, his crossing, on the move or set pieces.
Hes the one I used to look up to on crossing the ball for sure, he said.
The 27-year-old has never met Beckham, but it is hard to imagine that remaining the case for long should he head home from Russia as a World Cup hero.  Agencies

Brazils Danilo ruled out of World Cup with ankle problem
KAZAN, Thursday- Brazil right back Danilo has been ruled out of the rest of the World Cup after suffering ankle ligament damage in training on the eve of Fridays quarter-final against Belgium, the Brazilian Football Confederation (CBF) said in a statement.
The 26-year-old suffered a thigh problem in Brazils opening group game against Switzerland and has since been replaced in the team by Fagner. Danilo himself came into the side after Dani Alves pulled out of the squad before the finals through injury.
The CBF said on its official website www.cbf.com.br that a scan on the Manchester City player had confirmed a ligament injury in his left ankle that ruled him out of the tournament in Russia.
Danilo had asked to remain with the squad and had already begun to have treatment on the injury, the CBF added.
Brazil, who are favourites to lift the World Cup for a record sixth time, face Belgium at Kazan Arena on Friday.

Captains to challenge match officials on ball tampering ahead of Tests
Two captains who have been caught and punished for ball tampering South Africas Faf du Plessis and Sri Lankas Dinesh Chandimal were of the opinion that they should get clarity on what sweets are allowed and what is not on the field of play when the two-Test series commences at Galle on July 12.
It is important to say that I am not clear yet on that matter. My opinion on it is a lot straighter. They (the ICC) still havent said what is allowed and what is not allowed, said du Plessis at the press conference held at the Movenpick hotel yesterday where the two teams are staying.
Du Plessis was found guilty of tampering with the ball using mints to alter its condition and fined 100 percent of his match fee in the day-night Test against Australia at Adelaide last year.
Chandimal was fined 100 percent and banned for one Test for a similar offence using sweets taken from his pocket to alter the condition of the ball in the second Test against West Indies at St Lucias last month.
Is chewing gum allowed or not You can have mints in the mouth. Hashim Amla has said that he likes sweets in his mouth if you going to be a long time on the field. There is nothing wrong with it. For me I need clarity so I am looking forward to speaking to the umpires before the game to make sure we can get more clarity on the matter. I am sure Dinesh would want it as well, said du Plessis.
Before start of the match we want to have a chat with the umpires and get a clarification on what sweets we can carry in our pockets onto the field. We hope to get a clarification on it from the ICC match officials at the captains meeting, he said.
Speaking further Du Plessis said: Ball tampering is a serious offence. If you put something in your mouth and you shine the ball its not that serious. Thats my opinion. But if someone has the opportunity to try and do something with the ball the penalties that are there is going to make him think twice because you are going to miss a lot of cricket if you do that. As you have seen during the series against Australia things like that with the harsher penalties will be less in the game.
Du Plessis agreed that there are inconsistencies with regard to ball tampering during bilateral series with emphasis being laid on exposing the visiting sides mistakes than the home country by television producers. As a captain of any team you want consistency.
CHANDIMAL IN BETTER FRAME OF MIND
Sri Lanka captain Chandimal who will know his fate whether he will be leading the side against South Africa after the second inquiry (for refusing to take the field) two days before the start of the first Test said that the incidents had not affected his preparations for the series.
After that incident I appealed but I have to respect the ICC decision. It is tough as a human but I am now in a better frame of mind and I know what happened at that time, said Chandimal.
You face these kinds of challenges in cricket it is how you face them as a cricketer is the key. The team is in a good mental frame of mind having won the third Test against West Indies on difficult pitches. The players are confident of carrying that success into the South African series, he said.
After returning from the West Indies the Lankan cricketers held their first practice session yesterday.
Batting coach Thilan Samaraweera was confident that with the Kookaburra balls that will be used for the series the Lankan batsmen will be able to face upto the South African fast bowlers.
In the West Indies we got different conditions. I have toured West Indies twice and this time it was the hardest pitches we came across, in some areas of the pitches were bare patches and some areas had more grass it was more up and down, said Samaraweera.
HANDLING REVERSE SWING

The West indies series is totally different because of the Duke ball. We all know how the hard Duke balls behave. This is different conditions and we are using Kookaburra balls.
I think we can handle the South African bowlers. We have to give respect to the South African bowling side especially (Kagiso) Rabada, he is the most skilful bowler at the moment in the world for me. Its a tough challenge we have to handle the reverse swing well in the series. If we do that this series will be exciting, he said.
South Africa will be looking to have their premier fast bowler Dale Steyn up and running ahead of the Test series.
He is back in the squad and looks good in the nets. Its a case of getting his fitness back to where it needs to be in Test cricket. If we feel that he is ready to do that then he will play. Steyn has probably got the highest strike rate in the subcontinent amongst all the seam bowlers in the world, said Du Plessis.
South Africa are confident that with their four-prong pace attack of Steyn, Rabada, Philander and Ngidi they can roll over Sri Lanka. It is the skill sets that they represent. We got pace obviously and the ball in these conditions tend to reverse so when you have pace on your side generally the guys can take wickets. We also must understand the pitches; thats why we have brought three spinners. We want to try and make sure that we have all areas covered.
South Africa open their tour of Sri Lanka today with a two-day warm-up match against a Board XI at the P Sara Oval.
In the meantime Sri Lanka have brought in left-arm spinner Malinda Pushpakumara as cover for the injured Rangana Herath who is expected to undergo a fitness test on the split webbing of his right hand he suffered during practice in the Caribbean that led to him missing the third Test.

Collective approach, the key to incident free k/o tourney  Ex-DIG Hafeez Marso
Eight teams vied to clinch the Milo trophy knock-out schools A Division rugby championship. At the finals worked out at Race Course Grounds last Saturday, St. Peters came back strongly in the second half to edge St. Joseph by 22 points to 20 points after trailing by 12 points at the breather. It was a battle between St. Peters forwards and St. Joseph backs; the driving maul made all the difference for the former to take the honours. The strategic move came after the short blast where the winners exploited on the weakness of the opponent and opted to keep the game close and tight with the forwards for the driving maul to do the trick and this seemed to be a right royal ploy. Congratulations - St. Peters for the splendid performance and to the loosing team, St. Joseph - a round of applause for the spirited display. The battle of the rugby Saints, turned to be an exciting second half with the traditional rivals trying to show superiority over the other.
As for this segment (KO) of the tournament, the good work done by the Sri Lanka Schools Rugby Football Association (SLSRFA), sponsors, teams and the team management, the officials and those who worked behind the scene are worthy of being mentioned; and most importantly, the behaviour of the spectators was impeccable. The whole tournament was conducted without any hiccup. Many of us may be keen to know what made things to change Speaking exclusively to the Daily News Hafeez Marso - former DIG, Rugby legend, ex President of the Western Province Rugby Football Union and newly appointed Security Advisor to Schools Rugby by the Sports Minister revealed following, about how the just concluded Milo inter schools rugby knock out tournament went without having a single incident of violence.
Interdependence
The purpose of writing this article is not to discuss about the matches but to critically analyse how misdeeds and immoral tendencies can creep into the game; the damage that can cause to the game; and how best those unscrupulous elements could be contained, avoided or eradicated for the game to continue and develop. Firstly, let us see how it was possible to conduct an incident free tournament The answer to that question is very simple. It is all about the stakeholders playing their role working together in a process that could be termed as Interdependence", a parlance that is naive to most of us.
There was better coordination and control that prevailed throughout the tournament precisely due to quarters and semis being played at one selected venue, the Sugathadasa Stadium under the close supervision of the SLSRFA and the finals staged at Race Course Grounds which obviously had a greater focus. As predicted, nothing untoward took place in the finals mainly because of the brotherhood that exist between the two traditional rival schools. This was the story behind the success of the knock out segment but similar conditions may not persist in a league tournaments due to the participation of large number of teams with the matches played at different locations, unless the authorities monitor the progress of the tournament and instinct discipline as they did towards the end of the league tournament this year. A clear vision towards a common objective can make a "sea change" for the future of rugby, a quest that is hard to come by, but not impossible.
Initiatives
It all started with the intervention of the Minister of Sports, Faizer Mustapha directing the SLSRFA to defuse the situation of unpleasant incidents taking place at schools matches followed by a comprehensive proposal. The proposed Awareness Campaign" had a significant impact to take the message across, perhaps launched only at the end of the Singer league tournament when the Milo trophy knock - out tournament was to begin in two weeks time. Kingswood College in their last match of the league distributed leaflets at the match venue denouncing violence to calm nerves; a great job indeed by the pioneers of school rugby in their small way; similarly some schools with the contacts of their old boys sought the assistance of the Police to maintain law and order as the host responsible for the security of the venue.
Yet again, the intervention of the Cinnamon Garden Police in arresting and producing to Courts, the spectator who is alleged to have assaulted a coach did sent the strongest message ever. Authorities should to be thankful to the Police for showing the path of zero tolerance. Having said that, it should be categorically reemphasise that physical security is not the solution to the issue in question. With such background in place, naturally a conducive atmosphere was created to stage the knock - out round; and adding more to this trend, the sponsors of the Milo trophy was spot on to drive a propaganda campaign themed Respect the Game we Love which gave further impetus to the message of zero tolerance via media, social media in particular, thus making the intentions very clear. In the process, more prominence was given by the sponsors to the upbringing of the sports than to its branding. The huge banner depicting the theme of the tournament displayed by the school children before the commencement of the finals was indeed impressive and this act alone may have probably contained the impulsive testosterone.

Croatia look to seize moment against World Cup hosts Russia
SOCHI, Thursday - Croatia are targeting the World Cup semi-finals for the first time since 1998 -- when they made their debut as an independent nation on footballs biggest stage.
It is unwise to look too far ahead at an event so full of surprises, but will a Croatian team facing host nation Russia in the last eight ever get a better chance to outdo the heroes of two decades ago
Zlatko Dalics side showed in their comprehensive dismantling of Argentina during the group phase that they have no fear of the big names, and there is a strong case to say they are the best team left in their half of the draw.
England might disagree, and the two countries could yet meet in the semi-finals.
However, while Croatia needed penalties to beat Denmark in the last round, they have come to Sochi full of confidence.
We have shown in this World Cup that we have the right to hope for big things.
We are playing really well and we have such players that we certainly should believe can go to the very end, said defender Domagoj Vida.
Any team boasting a player of Luka Modrics quality can afford to dream, especially when he is supported by Ivan Rakitic and Mario Mandzukic.
He is our captain, he is our leader, we all stand behind him, said Inter Milan winger Ivan Perisic of Modric.
MODRIC QUALITY
The Real Madrid player is possibly the best midfielder at the tournament but the strength in depth for such a small country is remarkable. Sixteen of Dalics squad play in Europes big five leagues, with Monaco goalkeeper Danijel Subasic the hero against Denmark when he saved three penalties.
The powerful Ante Rebic has impressed as well, fresh from scoring twice for Eintracht Frankfurt in their German Cup final win over Bayern Munich. Bringing the 24-year-old winger back into the international fold has been one of the changes made by Dalic, who replaced Ante Cacic as coach late last year.  AFP

Defending champ Kirk leads Thornberry LPGA with record-tying 62
Los Angeles, Friday: Defending champion Katherine Kirk bounced back from the worst round of her pro career with a sparkling 62 on Thursday to seize the first-round lead at the Thornberry Creek LPGA Classic.
Golf is funny, the Australian veteran said shortly after matching the course with her 10-under effort.
When youve played it as long as I have professionally you realize some days will be good and some will be bad.
Thursday was good from the get-go as Kirk opened with birdies at 10, 11 and 12 on the par-72 Thornberry Creek course in Oneida, Wisconsin, quickly putting her second-round 83 at last weeks KPMG Womens PGA Championship out of her mind.
She birdied seven of her first nine holes, then birdied three more coming in, hitting 14 of 14 fairways and 17 of 18 greens in regulation.
Obviously there are good vibes here and I have a lot of confidence on this golf course, said Kirk, who won with a 22-under par total last year for her third LPGA title and her first in seven years.
It just suits my eye. So with that being said, you can only play one hole at a time. Thats all I did today. I just stayed in the moment.
South Koreas Kim Sei-Young carded a nine-under 63 that included six straight birdies on her back nine.
Canadas Brittany Marchand and American Megan Khang were tied for third on eight-under 64.
Khang enjoyed the ideal scoring conditions and the aggressive approach they allowed.
I definitely knew that the course was gettable, she said. Just last year I think the winning score was 22-under. Definitely with the amount of rain we got we knew that we could go after some pins.
I personally like to play aggressive, added Khang, who has four top-10 finishes this year. I think this will be a good week.
In ideal scoring conditions, the average for the round was 69.58.
Emma Talley reeled off nine birdies in 10 holes from the second through the 11th, a spell that included six birdies in a row.
She admitted that half a dozen birdies on the trot briefly had her thinking of a 59.
I was already counting in my head at one point, what do I have to do to shoot 59, she said. It kind of went downhill from there. I had never even played 13, 14 or 15 yet because it got rained out yesterday.
After her birdie binge ended at the 11th, Talley parred six straight before a closing bogey.
Thank goodness I had a good start, she said. The last few holes were a little rough. AFP

Defending champ Muguruza out of Wimbledon as seeds scatter
LONDON, Thursday - Defending champion Garbine Muguruza was sensationally knocked out of Wimbledon by journeywoman Alison van Uytvanck on Thursday, leaving just one of the top six seeds left after only two rounds.
Belgian 47th-ranked Van Uytvanck triumphed 5-7, 6-2, 6-1 for her first-ever win over a top 10 opponent.
Muguruza's defeat leaves just top seed Simona Halep, number seven Karolina Pliskova and 10th seed Madison Keys as the remaining top-ranked contenders after two rounds.
In the men's event, third seed and last year's runner-up Marin Cilic was knocked out by Argentina's Guido Pella.
Fourth seed Alexander Zverev was teetering on the brink of defeat when he trailed Taylor Fritz of the United States by two sets to one when their second round tie was suspended for the night.
Elsewhere, Rafael Nadal overcame two time warnings and Novak Djokovic shrugged off a knee problem to battle into the third round.
"I knew that if I let her play, I would lose so I thought, let's go for it," said 24-year-old Van Uytvanck, who has made the third round for the first time.
"I may have looked calm but inside I was dying."
Muguruza admitted it had not been her day. "She played big, took risks and it worked for her but my level was not where I wanted it to be," said the deposed champion.
"It's a little bit sad."
World number one Nadal defeated Mikhail Kukushkin of Kazakhstan 6-4, 6-3, 6-4 and will next face Australian teenager Alex de Minaur.
Djokovic, the three-time champion, needed treatment on his left knee on Court Two but still had too much for Argentina's Horacio Zeballos, winning 6-1, 6-2, 6-3.
Djokovic has now made the third round for 10 consecutive years and will face British 21st seed Kyle Edmund.
Cilic blew a two-set lead in his 3-6, 1-6, 6-4, 7-6 (7/3), 7-5 loss to Argentina's Guido Pella, ranked at 82.
When rain forced the tie to be postponed on Wednesday, Cilic was leading by two sets against an opponent who had never won a match at Wimbledon before this year.
But the Croatian collapsed once the match resumed on Court One on Thursday and Pella took full advantage to set up a third round clash with Mackenzie McDonald of the United States.
Cilic, the 2014 US Open champion, had been expected to mount a strong challenge for the Wimbledon title after winning the grass-court warm-up at Queen's Club two weeks ago.
But his defeat is good news for defending champion Roger Federer, who was on course to face Cilic in the semi-finals.
"Yesterday he was playing so good, hitting the ball so hard that I couldn't do anything," Pella said.
"So the rain helped me a lot. Today I played differently, tried to be more aggressive, he started to feel uncomfortable."
TIME VIOLATION
Nadal, the 2008 and 2010 champion, was tested by world number 77 Kukushkin who was made to pay for converting just two of 13 break points.
He was also hit with two time violations -- one before the match had even started as he sat courtside.
"I didn't know but I don't see a clock here. I don't see a countdown. It's more difficult for me to understand what's going on," said 11-time French Open champion Nadal, who is chasing an 18th major.
For Djokovic, meanwhile, victory was his 60th at Wimbledon.
He hit 15 aces and 31 winners in a commanding win over 33-year-old Zeballos, who was a top 40 player in 2013 but was playing at Wimbledon ranked a lowly 126.
Former world number one Djokovic shrugged off a knee injury he suffered in the match.
"It's most likely a twitch in the muscle or something like this that has affected the knee a little bit. Hopefully it's nothing that will concern me," said Djokovic.
Three-time major winner Stan Wawrinka was unable to follow up his first round defeat of sixth seed Grigor Dimitrov when he lost 7-6 (9/7), 6-3, 7-6 (8/6) to Italian qualifier Thomas Fabbiano.
Fifth-seeded Juan Martin del Potro, who made the semi-finals in 2013, eased past 36-year-old Feliciano Lopez, a three-time quarter-finalist, who was playing in a record 66th consecutive major.
Del Potro's 6-4, 6-1, 6-2 win set-up a third round clash with France's Benoit Paire.
John Isner, the US ninth seed, saved two match points, fired 64 aces and 88 winners to defeat Belgian qualifier Ruben Bemelmans 6-1, 6-4, 6-7 (6/8), 6-7 (3/7), 7-5.
Nick Kyrgios, seeded 15, unleashed 42 winners to see off Robin Haase of the Netherlands 6-3, 6-4, 7-5.
Kyrgios next faces Japan's Kei Nishikori who put out Australian lucky loser Bernard Tomic 2-6, 6-3, 7-6 (9/7), 7-5.
French Open champion Halep reached the third round with a 7-5, 6-0 win over China's Zheng Saisai and next plays Hsieh Su-Wei of Taiwan.

Dominant Windies leave Bangladesh facing innings defeat
ANTIGUA AND BARBUDA, Thursday: Bangladesh were sliding towards a massive innings defeat after the West Indies completely dominated the second day of the first Test match at the Sir Vivian Richards Stadium in Antigua on Thursday.
After Kraigg Brathwaites seventh Test hundred anchored the West Indies first innings total of 406 to give the home side a first innings lead of 363, Shannon Gabriel compensated for a wicketless effort on the opening day with figures of four for 36 to reduce the visitors to 62 for six in their second turn at the crease by the close of play.
Routed for just 43, their lowest-ever Test innings total, in the first innings, the Bangladeshis still need another 301 runs just to make the West Indies bat again going into day three.
That looks an impossible prospect in conditions which are completely alien to them and in which the home sides quartet of fast bowlers has revelled.
But for a no-ball delivered by Miguel Cummins in the last over of the day when he could have claimed the wicket of Mahmudullah, the West Indies would have had the option of requesting an additional half-hour at the end of the day to finish off the match.
It leaves Mahmudullah to resume on the third morning with wicketkeeper-batsman Nurul Hasan, although it will be merely delaying the inevitable given the struggles of the Bangladeshis in coping with the pace and bounce of their West Indian opponents in seamer-friendly conditions.
Jason Holder took the other two wickets, sharing the new ball with the fiery Gabriel in the absence of Kemar Roach, who initiated the demolition of the Bangladesh first innings with outstanding figures of five for eight but was troubled by what appeared to be a muscular strain at the back of his right knee during that effort.
He showed no discomfort though in an innings of 33 and a partnership of 58 with Shai Hope for the eighth wicket.
However the bulk of the batting effort for the West Indies was provided by the erstwhile Brathwaite, who occupied the crease for over seven hours  from before lunch on day one to just after lunch on day two  in compiling 121.
Hope ensured the West Indies middle-order didn't buckle completely.
Resuming at the overnight position of 201 for two with Brathwaite and nightwatchman Devendra Bishoo at the crease, they suffered a mini-collapse in early afternoon when losing three wickets for 16 runs.
That was the only period in the Test match so far when the Bangladeshis appeared to be holding any sort of initiative as spinners Mehidy Hasan and Shakib al Hasan posed significant challenges.
However Hope showed his class in an innings of 67 and by the time he was ninth out with the score at 400, the only question was whether or not the West Indies could have been as ruthless as in the first innings to finish the match inside two days.
Gabriels raw pace was too hot to handle for the Bangladesh top-order as he claimed the prized scalps of Tamim Iqbal, Mominul Haque, Mushfiqur Rahim and captain Shakib al Hasan to lift his tally of Test wickets in this Caribbean season to 24 in four matches.

England must cash in on favourable World Cup hand says Southgate
MOSCOW, Thursday - Manager Gareth Southgate says England might not have this opportunity again as he plots a way past Sweden in the quarter-finals to a first World Cup semi-final appearance in three decades.
Southgate told the BBC on Thursday his team of youngsters led by Golden Boot contender Harry Kane must make the most of the way the cards have fallen for them in Russia.
Its a great opportunity, and although our team will be individually better in two years, we might not have this opportunity again, said Southgate.
Englands penalty shootout win over Colombia in the last 16 means only Sweden stand between them and reaching the semi-finals for the first time since 1990.
But despite all the euphoria generated back in England by his teams progress, Southgate cautioned against getting too far ahead of themselves.
You have to enjoy the good moments, but I am a long way from perfect, there are plenty of mistakes we have made while we have been here and we will make moving forward, so I think it is dangerous territory if we get carried away with things, said Southgate.
Sweden have proved a notoriously tough rival for England in the past, with Southgate pointing out: They are older, more experienced, and have a better tournament record than us.
England face Sweden in Samara on Saturday, with the winner of that going on to play either Croatia or 2018 hosts Russia in the last four.  AFP
