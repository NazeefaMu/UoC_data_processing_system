All parties should pay heed to SAITM verdict: Kiriella
All parties should pay heed to the SAITM verdict whether they like it or not, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella said. The minister stated these views attending an English Course Student Enrollment at the North Central Provincial Council Auditorium on February 3.
"Protests are being held against the SAITM, which was established during the previous regime. Students who graduated from the SAITM as doctors last year went to Court. Now the Court has given a verdict on this issue," he said. The minister said no parties or groups spoke against the SAITM when it was established during the previous regime because they were afraid of being kidnapped in white vans.
"The SAITM was not the only institution to start private medical institutes. The Kothalawala Defence University started a medical faculty. But nobody spoke against it as everyone was afraid of the then Defence Secretary. Students had to pay to study at the Medical Faculty of the Kothalawala Defence University. If private medical clinics are allowed why is private education banned he queried. The minister said students at state universities are the best. Students at the Faculty of Arts are the best students as they enter universities according to the highest marks, the minister said.

Australia take command over Czechs
MELBOURNE AFP Feb3, 2017Nick Kyrgios conceded just seven games in powering Australia to a 2-0 rubber lead over the Czech Republic after the first day of the Davis Cup World Group tie in Melbourne on Friday.
The controversial world number 15 took just 95 minutes to reel off a 6-2, 6-3, 6-2 win over the 157th-ranked Jan Satral and consolidate Australia's grip on the tie on hardcourt at Kooyong.
Rookie Jordan Thompson upset Czech number one Jiri Vesely 6-3, 6-3, 6-4 in the opening singles match in two hours and six minutes.
Thompson, 22 and ranked 65, made surprisingly light work of the 54th-ranked Vesely to sink the Czech Republic's hopes of splitting the opening day singles.
Kyrgios, who was fined US$5,500 for swearing and throwing his racquet after a stormy second round exit to Andreas Seppi at last month's Australian Open, showed no signs of such volatile behaviour under the watchful eye of Australia captain Lleyton Hewitt.
His big-hitting game overwhelmed the hapless Satral although he needed six match points to finally put away the Czech.
Kyrgios won just his third live Davis Cup rubber for Australia following earlier victories in World Group play-off ties against Uzbekistan's Denis Istomin in 2014 and Andrej Martin in 2016.
He improved his record to 5-3 in singles rubbers against Satral, who was making his Davis Cup debut.
Thompson was handed his debut by captain Hewitt after the 27th-ranked Bernard Tomic made himself unavailable, citing scheduling issues, while Vesely took over as the top-ranked Czech player following the unavailability of world number ten Tomas Berdych.
The young Australian began well with a break in the opening game and had few problems with the shaky Czech left-hander making five service breaks.
It's the biggest moment in my career, the summer has been pretty good, but playing for your country is amazing and getting us off to a 1-0 lead is even better, Thompson said.
There were some nerves at the start, but I was just glad the balls were coming off the racquet nicely. Vesely said ahead of the clash: It's something new for me, I've never started a tie before so it's definitely a new experience for me.
It is the eighth meeting in Davis Cup for the two nations with Australia leading 7-1. Australia won their last meeting 3-2 at the same stage two years ago in Ostrava.
Australia lost in the first round last year, but defeated Slovakia in a play-off to maintain their World Group status, while Czech Republic reached last year's quarter-finals but fell to France.

Cabinet reshuffle in the offing
President will decide the date:
Section of public sees need for reshuffle:
A Cabinet reshuffle is in the offing but the date will depend on the President, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
There is a certain opinion among the public that there needs to be a Cabinet reshuffle. A similar view exists within the party, Minister Amaraweera who also holds the position of UPFA General Secretary said. The minister was addressing a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry yesterday.
He however added that the government would not be toppled anytime soon. It is a joke to think that a government can be toppled in two years, he said even though this is the very claim the opposition continues to make.
The opposition always protests. The people have become desensitised to it. When the UNP was in power, we would say that we were going to topple the government that year, but the UNP stayed in power for 17 years. When UNP was in opposition, they did the same but nothing happened for 20 years! remarked Amaraweera.
The Joint Opposition is trying to create a split within the SLFP and this has been blamed for the continued postponement of the Local Government elections.
We are trying our best to unite the party but that does not mean that certain factions can take advantage of our good intentions. We need to conduct the Local Government elections soon. If a certain faction is trying to break away they can do so.We can then rebuild the party,Amaraweera said when asked about the delay in elections.
In answer to reports that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa would contest through a separate party, he said, if he goes out on his own, he will remain on his own.
No breakaway group has succeeded in history.They always return to the party in the end,he said.

Chamari one of 10 players to watch
Sri Lankas Chamari Atapattu is among the 10 players the ICC has identified as to watch in the Womens World Cup qualifier 2017 which will be held in Colombo from February 7-21.
An admirer of Sanath Jayasuriyas attacking style of play, Chamari Atapattu is an integral part of the Sri Lankan team. Helped by Kumar Sangakkaras advice to pace her innings, she has been both an aggressor and accumulator in the batting line-up.
She first burst onto the scene with a century against Ireland Women in 2011, but the biggest impact knock of her career remains her 62 in a one-wicket win over England Women in the 2013 World Cup in Mumbai. In the nine ODI wins she has been a part of, she has made four half-centuries, signifying her importance in the side. She is also the only Sri Lankan to score two ODI centuries. She fell one short of scoring her third ton, against Pakistan Women in January 2015.
Atapattu lost her father soon after being selected to the national team for the first time, but has used the setback as an inspiration to keep her career moving. Outside of cricket, Atapattu works for a bank in Colombo.
The other women cricketers to watch are Deepti Sharma (India), Precious Marange (Zimbabwe), Kim Garth (Ireland), Sornnarin Tippoch (Thailand), Sune Luus (South Africa), Anam Amin (Pakistan), Rumana Ahmed (Bangladesh), Kathryn Bryce (Scotland) and Ravini Oa (PNG).

Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne warned that if anyone goes against the Court of Appeal decision in connection with SAITM, it will be considered contempt of court and a punishable offence with two years rigorous imprisonment, a Health Ministry Spokesman said.
The spokesman said Senaratne had said the private medical colleges should operate in the country and all parties have agreed.
There was no objection to SAITM before 2015. The Kothalawala Defence University has a private medical faculty which charge money from medical students. The students receive training at the Sri Jayawardanapura Hospital. Earlier they received clinical training at the Colombo National Hospital. No one objected to that, Dr. Senaratne said.
The minister also stated that he did not interfere in the SAITM issue and each medical student from SAITM pays Rs. 5,000 to the Government for the training they receive at the Avissawella state hospital and Kaduwela MOH.
The minister pointed out that some state medical faculties do not have the standard that SAITM has while some unqualified persons are in some state medical faculties.

CR crashes to third loss in a row  lose to Navy 34/37
CR&FC crashed to their third successive defeat in a row when they went down by 34 points (5 tries, 3 conversions, 1 penalty) to 37 (3 tries, 2 conversions, 5 penalties, 1 drop goal) to Navy Sports Club in a Dialog A division inter-club league rugby second round match played at CR & FC grounds. Longden Place yesterday, Navy led 21-19 at the breather.
It was an awesome performance orchestrated by Navy with a fabulous display of fast open rugby throughout the game where they totally dominated the set pieces through their heavy forwards who combined effectively with their entire three quarter line and totally dominated the game simply overrunning the opposition at will in the last quarter.
The CR coach did not lay out any defensive plans or attacking rugby and proved that he has failed miserably as the head coach throughout this year's entire league where he took out fly half Ashan de Costa who had a good game and replaced him in the second half due to reasons only known to him. This move spoiled the superb pattern of play that the red shirts carried out.
CR players are capable of doing wonders for the club but lack a good head coach who is capable of fine tuning the players in order to get the entire team to rally around and play as one unit rather than playing in patches.
For the winning Navy team the tries were scored by fly half Chanaka Chandimal (one), hooker Dulanjana Wijesinghe (one) and winger Supun Dilshan (one). Full back Thilina Wijesinghe put over two conversions and the five penalties. The solitary drop goal was fired across by Chandimal.
Number eight Omalka Gunaratne (two), winger Anuradha Herath (one), flanker Shemal Weerasekara (one) and winger Randhitha Warnapura (one) scored the tries for CR. The three conversions and the penalty was put over by full back Nalin Kumara.

Department of Homeland Security suspends Trump travel ban

President Donald Trump's government moved swiftly Saturday to comply with a federal judge's order halting his immigration ban - even as Trump denounced the judge.
The Department of Homeland Security announced it has suspended all actions to implement the immigration order and will resume standard inspections of travelers as it did prior to the signing of the travel ban.
A State Department official also told CNN the department has reversed the cancellation of visas that were provisionally revoked following the President's executive order last week - so long as those visas were not stamped or marked as canceled.
The State Department has said fewer than 60,000 visas were revoked since the signing of the order. It was not immediately clear how many from that group will continue to be without their visas because their visas were physically canceled.
Following the judge's ruling - and before the government's announcements Saturday morning - the International Air Transportation Association, a leading airline industry group, wrote to its members to follow procedures as if the executive order never existed.
The whirlwind turn of events set up the nation for a second straight weekend of widespread uncertainty over the controversial ban, this time with the administration on defense.
Friday night, the White House announced the Justice Department would file an emergency motion to stop the halt, but it had yet to do so as of late Saturday morning.
But Washington state Attorney General Bob Ferguson told CNN's Anderson Cooper Friday night that he was prepared to take his case all the way to the Supreme Court if necessary.
Trump's order bars citizens of seven Muslim-majority countries - Iraq, Syria, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan and Yemen - from entering the US for 90 days, all refugees for 120 days and indefinitely halts refugees from Syria.
Outrageous order
Federal Judge James Robart, a George W. Bush appointee who presides in Seattle, halted the enforcement of Trump's order Friday night, effective nationwide.
Robart, ruling in a lawsuit brought by the attorneys general of Washington state and Minnesota who sought to stop the order, said the states have met their burden of demonstrating that they face immediate and irreparable injury as a result of the signing and implementation of the Executive Order. 
He said the order adversely affects residents in areas of education, employment, education and freedom to travel.
The decision was met with swift denunciation by the White House - which originally called it outrageous before removing that word in a statement issued minutes later - and Trump himself, who blasted the judge personally Saturday morning.
The opinion of this so-called judge, which essentially takes law-enforcement away from our country, is ridiculous and will be overturned! he tweeted.
Trump also sent out a series of tweets lamenting the ruling.
When a country is no longer able to say who can, and who cannot, come in & out, especially for reasons of safety &.security - big trouble! he tweeted.
Robart's ruling may have stung even more for the Trump administration because it came on the heels of its first legal victory over the travel ban. Hours earlier Friday, a federal judge in Boston issued a more limited ruling that declined to renew a temporary restraining order in Massachusetts, which would have prohibited the detention or removal of foreign travelers legally authorized to come to the Boston area.
But it was the sweeping ruling from Seattle that had the federal government scrambling.
Visas to be reinstated
US Customs and Border Protection alerted airlines Friday night that the US government would quickly begin reinstating visas that were previously canceled, and it advised airlines that refugees in possession of US visas will be admitted as well, an airline executive said.
CBP told major US airlines Friday night that the government is in the process of reinstating visas and is "back to business as usual" before the situation that was in place before last week's executive order, the airline executive told CNN. Airlines were expected to remove travel alerts from their websites and get messages out to customers to alert them about the change.
It is possible there will be more court activity and an appeal before anyone could act on getting a visa, and it's unclear how long it would take to obtain one.
US airlines use an automated system connected to the Customs and Border Protection database to scan passports and visas to get an instant determination if the passenger can board or not. Unless the government reinstates visas and the airlines get a board status, the airlines still would not allow such passengers to board.
Airlines were adjusting to the new developments Saturday. Qatar Airways announced it would allow nationals from the seven countries affected by Trump's travel ban and all refugees presenting a valid, unexpired US visa or green card to travel to the United States.
Refugee groups relieved
Refugee resettlement agencies across the US welcomed Robart's ruling.
President Trump's ban against refugees and Muslims was not only un-American, but Judge Robart found it to be unconstitutional, Mark Hetfield, president and CEO of the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, told CNN on Saturday.
Thanks to Judge Robert's order protecting the Constitution, thousands of refugees who were bound for the US can finally find protection - and a warm welcome - here.
But this won't be the end of our fight to keep America's door open to refugees, he added.
Because of the logistical coordination required to organize refugee arrivals, resettlement groups reached by CNN did not expect them to resume immediately.
Once a refugee is vetted and approved for resettlement, the agencies coordinate with the International Organizations for Migration to arrange their placement with a local chapter. The UN's Office of the High Commissioner for Refugees is involved in that process, as are the Departments of State and Homeland Security, and the government of the country from which refugees are applying.
Resettlement agencies have been working with the State Department's Bureau of Population Refugees and Migration to determine when admissions can resume while local branches prepare to welcome the new arrivals.
Daniel Smith, an immigration attorney in Seattle, predicted a flood of people trying to enter the US over the next few days due to the legal opening.
I am advising clients who are in the country now - don't leave, Smith said. And any clients wanting to enter the country, it's best if you try to get in right now and then stay put if you get here.
Likely to affect Gorsuch confirmation process
Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump's criticism of the judge will be cited in the Supreme Court nomination of Neil Gorsuch.
The President's attack on Judge James Robart, a Bush appointee who passed with 99 votes, shows a disdain for an independent judiciary that doesn't always bend to his wishes and a continued lack of respect for the Constitution, making it more important that the Supreme Court serve as an independent check on the administration, Schumer said in a statement.
With each action testing the Constitution, and each personal attack on a judge, President Trump raises the bar even higher for Judge Gorsuch's nomination to serve on the Supreme Court. His ability to be an independent check will be front and center throughout the confirmation process.

EDITORIAL: Reflections on Freedom
Sixty nine years ago, Sri Lanka regained its independence after nearly 450 years of colonial rule. It was a tumultuous four centuries that would alter the course of history and the countrys destiny. Sri Lanka, then known as Ceylon, breathed a collective sigh of relief as colonial domination came to an end on February 4, 1948.
Today, we are on the threshold of the 70th anniversary of Independence. The last seven decades have seen many social, political and economic upheavals in this country, some of which have left deep scars in our memory. But what matters ultimately is that we are free.
Freedom means many things to different people. In a broader sense and in the context of a nation, it means that the people are free to chart their own destiny. Looking back, there are many things that we could have done better, many matters that could have been handled differently and more prudently. The twin banes of politics and division stymied or progress and clouded our vision, as a result of which we have suffered immensely.
When we gained freedom in 1948, we were second only to then war-battered Japan in terms of economic and social development. Many respected Asian leaders proclaimed that they wished to emulate Sri Lanka. Yet we managed to fall off that perch rather quickly, as our politicians entered the dangerous territory of ethnic discord for their own gain. They pitted the various communities and religious groups against each other for petty electoral gains, a tactic that would boomerang on them years later, with disastrous consequences for the entire nation. The ethnic strife that began in the early eighties raged on for the next three decades, pushing back the countrys economic and social progress and eliminating a sizeable number of young men and women on both sides of the ethnic divide. In between, we witnessed two youth insurrections in the South, caused by the leaders failure to address the grievances of youth. The insurrections apart, political squabbling by various political parties cost the country heavily in terms of political stability. In more recent times, Sri Lanka faced international isolation due to the shortsighted foreign policy of the previous Government.
Now that the conflict is over, Sri Lanka is once again free to realise its full potential. Although the conflict ended nearly eight years ago, the previous administration did little to address the root causes that led to it. Instead of bringing Sri Lankans together, it sought to divide them further on ethnic and religious lines for its own political survival.
However, the National Unity Government that came to power in 2015 changed this divisive narrative, giving priority to ethnic integration and reconciliation. The idea was to establish lasting peace and extinguish any communal embers. There are many other ways in which the Government is expanding on the premise of freedom, from the Right to Information (RTI) law to the restoration of law and order. By ensuring the fundamental rights of freedom of expression, media freedom and the right to live without fear and suspicion, the Government is striving to make freedom a more meaningful concept to all Sri Lankans.
Sri Lanka has also once again become a respected member of the International Community, adhering to universally accepted human rights. Contrary to the opinion expressed by certain Opposition politicians that adhering to human rights norms is tantamount to a loss of our sovereignty and freedom, exactly the opposite is true  the more we disregard the human rights of our own citizens, the more we are susceptible to outside interference in our domestic affairs. Human rights are universal values after all.
Sri Lanka now has a golden opportunity ahead of it to accelerate societal and economic progress in order to catch up with the decades it lost to war. The Government has laid a firm foundation for an economic overhaul with a three-year sustainable development plan. Education and health have been identified as two key pillars that will add impetus to our freedom and progress. The empowerment of women too is a key pillar of freedom. While Sri Lankan girls have full access to education unlike in many developing countries, we have not fared well in some sectors  the number of women especially in the corridors of power is pitifully small and the gender pay gap is still a problem. These are pertinent questions that policy makers must ponder on.
At the end of the day, physical and social development will come to naught if we do not evolve a truly Sri Lankan identity that reinforces our freedom, which is not just a concept, but also a state of mind. We must feel free in every sense of the word. We hope that the proposed new Constitution will address this vital issue. For far too long, we have failed to identify ourselves as Sri Lankans, putting ethnicity first and paid a heavy price. Now we have an opportunity to rectify that mistake. It is an opportunity that we as a proud and truly independent nation must not miss.

The following extract is reproduced from Ceylon Daily News of February 5, 1949
The climax to Ceylons first Independence anniversary celebrations was reached yesterday evening when four of the islands outstanding athletes drawn from the four major communities completed the last lap of the marathon relay.
They came, dead on time, bearing with them the scrolls containing messages which will lie buried for centuries under the lonely memorial in Torrington Square where Ceylons first Dominion Parliament was inaugurated last year.
It was a fitting climax to a historic occasion and unlike the Greek marathon runner, Pheidippides who died at the gates of Athens in the conveying of his message in 490 B.C. The four marathon runners in Ceylon brought their messages and handed them to four girls, also drawn from the major communities, who in turn handed them to the Father of the Nation, Mr. D. S. Senanayake to be deposited in the foundation of the Memorial.
Spirit of Independence
There was hardly anyone in Ceylon yesterday who did not share the spirit of independence from morning large crowds were out attending religious services parades and other ceremonies in connection with the celebration and when darkness fell thousands thronged the city...

FEATURE: Decades of Sovereignty
Another Independence Day has dawned and the atmosphere is charged with national fervor and sentiment. The customary parade at Galle Face, where it all began, spiced with cultural pageants and the display of military prowess will be the chief attraction at the 69th National Day. Other ceremonies too would be held countrywide to mark the momentous occasion with events highlighting patriotism and national unity taking center stage. The national flag will flutter proudly on all state buildings and most homes. Politicians will deliver their usual messages calling for national unity and religious leaders will espouse the need for amity and brotherhood as a cohesive force for nation building.
Every Independence Day the country's rulers gloat about a past grandeur and the need to emulate the achievements of our great forefathers. However, looking back over the past, seven decades since Independence, Sri Lanka as a nation has yet to realize the ideals espoused by our leaders on that first Independence Day.
Vast improvement
True, Sri Lanka has today advanced to the level of a middle income country. We have improved in many spheres. Sri Lanka has perhaps the best health care system in South Asia and could boast of a high life expectancy, low Infant mortality rate and welfare indices that could match, or even surpass economically advanced countries in the region.
But, for all that, a sizable proportion of the country's population is still living in poverty. For them, this Independence, as others before it, no doubt would have meant nothing. For true Independence, the people of a nation, at least a sizable proportion of the countrymen, should be a happy and contended lot. Some would rightly contend that the country had only received political independence, but is still shackled in terms of economic independence and continue to depend on its former white masters to raise its economy. Pseudo patriots who shout hoarse that the country has been sold to foreigners have themselves failed to offer a solution. All governments since Independence have gone on bended knees for foreign aid plunging the country into a bottomless pit of debt.
Economic prosperity
Even though physical development is evident all round, social development has not matched the advances made in this regard. For all the boasts of a 90 percent literary rate most of the population are backward in many respects. Economic prosperity to its citizens promised by all governments following independence still remains a mirage with exploitation of labour continuing as before. Economic dividends of the state are still enjoyed by only a few with the vast majority left out. Solutions to these problems have still eluded all governments since independence. It is in this backdrop that the country is today observing Independence Day.
The celebrations itself have lost their luster compared to the past. This most important event in the national calendar too appears to have suffered the vagaries of commercialization and the market place, with February 4 being just another holiday for enjoyment and revelry to most. Much more significance and meaning needs to be attached to Independence, with rulers taking the lead in inculcating the spirit of Independence among the populace in a more tangible way than at present.
Perhaps the fact that Independence was gained without the spilling of blood, unlike countries such as India, may be the reason for this laissez-faire attitude among Lankans.
Independence Day celebrations in the immediate post colonial era though were elaborate ones where not just the ceremony but also that which mirrored the aspirations of a people just redeemed from foreign subjugation and expressed with vigour and justifiable pride. The wish of the people was to forge ahead in achieving national goals as set out by the leaders and everyone put their shoulder to the wheel irrespective of nationality, ethnicity, cast, creed or other differences.
National endeavour
That is why our post Independence history is littered with the feats of national endeavour of stalwarts from the minority community. These were colossuses who stood shoulder to shoulder with the leaders of the majority community to give the stamp of recognition to the country in the social, economic and cultural fields. All strove for national progress with no time for parochialism and petty squabbling. Hopefully this spirit of camaraderie and conviviality among the communities that prevailed in the nascent independence days will be witnessed soon with the stage set for national reconciliation after a fractious war that sharpened divisions and split the nation on ethnic lines.
It is also the time for close introspection to ascertain the true meaning of national independence transcending the pomp and ceremony. This is because over the years the national day celebrations have gradually lost their relevance and significance to most, with its real meaning subsumed in the parades and the military panoply. As mentioned before Independence was achieved by the collective effort of all communities. As such today's Independence Day too should be shared equally by all. All communities and ethnic groups should be infused with a sense of belonging. The government's decision to have the National Anthem sung in Tamil should exemplify this sense of belonging. All communities should be urged to put behind their differences and acrimony that was sharpened by three decades of ethnic conflict and resolve to live like brothers and sisters of one Lankan family.
All Lankans also should resolve to forget all petty differences springing out of political divisions and work towards rebuilding a new Sri Lanka. Much damage has been caused to the national fabric as a result of contentious and acrimonious politics that have divided the nation as never before stifling progress and development. Selfish motives should be banished from one's mind and patriotism given true expression in one's actions on behalf of the country.
Today, most in our midst though disporting themselves as patriots do not demonstrate this by their actions. Strikes are resorted to at the slightest provocation at a time the state is in need of all the resources it could muster to achieve the country's development goals.
Maximum rewards
We are devoid of a work ethic, preferring to do the least we possibly can while demanding the maximum rewards from the State. We have become a nation lacking in initiative. Waste is rampant and corruption endemic. Little, or, nothing is done to rectify the situation, all cumulatively affecting the nation's forward march.
This is hardly the recipe for nation building and could be a reason why nearly seven decades down the line we are still languishing behind most countries that gained independence at the same time as Sri Lanka. One recalls Singapore Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew urging his country to follow the example of then Ceylon in the immediate post independence era. But we fell by the wayside while S'pore, which was enjoined to follow our example, is today a developed and prosperous state. Where did we fail
Negative attitudes should be banished and Lankans as a whole should give of their maximum if we are to realize the dreams of our forefathers of reaping the rewards of true independence. Above all, it is important to move away from the external trappings of this most important Day and lay emphasis on the significance and substance of true Independence.
This should begin from our schools. Youth, from their formative years, should be inculcated in the ethos of the national freedom struggle, so that Independence can be celebrated on a more meaningful and dynamic note.

FEATURE: Facing the new challenges to Freedom
Stepping into the seventh decade of freedom and independence today, Sri Lanka faces the important challenge of building national unity with the strengthening of democracy and the Rule of Law. The country currently faces issues certainly bigger than those that confronted the leaders and people at the time of independence in 1948. Todays situation is to do with the absence of a clear policy on national unity at the time of independence, and the failure to develop a comprehensive policy for such unity in the sixty nine years now completed.
The record of the past 69 years shows nearly 30 years under conditions where national unity was not built, but many moves were made to divide the nation on ethnic and religious lines, mainly for advantage by political parties and the emergence of divisive trends in the country. For 30 years after that the country was facing a bloodbath of major proportions, due to the emergence of the forces of separatism and terrorism.
These forces of terrorism were militarily defeated in 2009, with the opportunity of building true national unity. But, the political leadership that defeated terrorism, showed little interest in building such unity; with more interest in widening the ethnic and religious divisions in the country, combined with the ingraining of corruption both in governance and society. The beginning of this 70th year of freedom, thus gives the country the opportunity to move in a new direction towards progress in unity, while strengthening the forces of democracy.
The major opportunity for this came with the Presidential Election of January 8, 2015, when the people took a decisive step in the defeat of the major force of authoritarianism, moving towards a clear dictatorship; after the President in office at the time, sought re-election for a third term, under an amendment to the Constitution, that gave the incumbent president the opportunity to run for any number of terms in office, not restricted to a two-term presidency.
The current news reports from Africa show how many of its elected national leaders, had carried out similar changes to the law and remained in office for periods from 20 to 30 years, and the crises faced by the countries where such dictatorships prevailed or remain.
The new responsibilities
It is relevant to recall here the words of President Maithripala Sirisena, when he addressed the nation on the 67th anniversary of Independence in 2015. He said: Although by 2009, after the defeat of LTTE terrorism, and bringing peace to our land, although we had the opportunity to take the physical resources of the land forward towards development, we were unable to do so; and to bring together the minds of the people of the North and South.
To end the war against terror, our heroic troops were able with their guns to silence the guns of terrorism. However, the biggest challenge we face today, is that of bringing together the minds of the people of the North and South, and through a process of reconciliation, bring about co-existence and national understanding, and thus take our great Motherland forward as a land rich in human affection and understanding.
In so moving forward, there are many responsibilities before us. We need to ask ourselves whether we can truly and honestly be satisfied with what we have achieved, as we celebrate this 67th anniversary of Independence. I think it is the great responsibility and duty before us today is to ask where we have gone wrong, and how we could correct those errors. As much as we look at the path we have trod in the 67 years of freedom, and especially since 2009, can we be satisfied at what has been achieved after the restoration of peace.
Issues that remain
As the country celebrates the 69th anniversary of Freedom and Independence, it is necessary to ask again where we have gone wrong in the tasks of building national unity, and how these errors could be corrected. Moving into the 70th year of freedom, the government remains bound by the pledges given in January 2015 to bring about a new transformation in politics, the economy, society and culture. Yet, much of the past two years have been wasted in a search for unity within the SLFP, where the clash of contending rivals, remain dominant, moving away from the larger tasks of governance that is the stuff of the government of National Unity, that brought together the UNP and SLFP, after January 8 and August 17, 2015.
Recent developments in politics have shown that this clash on Blue leadership is moving into open confrontation outside the SLFP structure, and will be seen in the expected Local Government Elections (whenever they are held), and the expected elections to three Provincial Councils. This is made clear by the announcement by Mahinda Rajapaksa, that he has taken over leadership of the Joint Opposition, and his statement this week that the JO would contest the Local Government polls separately. This clearly shows the way to open confrontation; moving away from the behind the scenes attempts at reaching understandings on the leadership issue in the SLFP.
The path ahead in this journey of freedom lies in Constitutional Reform that will take away all aspects of the Executive Presidency and lay down the guidelines for national unity through power sharing among people, which will give the much needed support to the tasks of economic progress, while underlining the equality of all citizens irrespective of ethnicity, faith and sex.
It is, therefore, no surprise that Constitutional Reform is at the very core of the new wave of opposition to the government, as seen in the rise of the Mahinda Rajapaksa rhetoric that has emerged from that recent Nugegoda rally of the JO  under the name of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP)  with the expectation to give a better political blossom to the lotus bud symbol of that party.
Nugegoda take-off
The recent Nugegoda rally is seen as the take off point of the new politics of the Rajapaksa leadership, and was best observed in that rally being named as the Aragalayaka Aarambaya  the launch of struggle. It is the struggle to win over the SLFP and UPFA voters who turned away from the Rajapaksa leadership on January 8 and August 17 2015, and take the country back to the era of corruption that prevailed till then. Interestingly, the new theme of the Rajapaksa leadership against the current government, and the leadership of President Sirisena, is to announce a fight against the corruption of the present government, and the promise to return to the people the public funds that have been lost in this new phase of corruption.
President Sirisena made a good response when confronted in what was a well calculated religious manoeuvre at the pro-Rajapaksa Abhayaramaya temple, when a senior monk raised questions about the recent Treasury bond scams. He was quick to respond with a declaration of determination to fight all the corruption of the Treasury bond scam with his decision to appoint a Special Presidential Commission to probe into the matter. In a quick follow up, the Gazelle notification on appointing the Special Commission has now been made. As the heat of Rajapaksa-led JO politics increases, the Government will certainly have to be on the watchout and take speedy action to prevent the spread of corruption within its ranks, and give more meaning to the wider fight against corruption during the Rajapaksa regime, which was a key pledge given to the people.
The bigger substance of the Aragalaya or Struggle that has been launched is against the moves to bring about constitutional change in the country. The campaign against it is based on driving the fear of separatism and the misuse of the idea of federalism, as well as, the building of increased ethnic and religious rivalry and hatred in the country.
The Nugegoda rally was certainly large. However, it was hardly different to the similar rally held in 2015 in the launch of the Rise with Mahinda campaign. Such rallies did not help the UPFA or Rajapaksas to win in the August 2015 General Election. In fact the votes of the UPFA were reduced in August 2015 from what it gained in January of that year. We do recall many columnists write with great enthusiasm on what a huge rally that first Rise with Mahinda event was, and how their related political projections went awry. Some see the recent Nugegoda event as the rise of a new revolution. One will have to wait and see.
What is clear is that the continuing months of this 70th year of Independence will certainly require a stronger commitment and fight by Government on Constitutional Reform, with a clear push for the abolition of the Executive Presidency. This will require campaigning for constitutional changes approved by a referendum, leaving no room for constitutional amendments that will not deliver the pledges made to the people. This must remain the battle that will mark this 70th year of Independence.

FEATURE: Fighters in the forefront
Sri Lanka will celebrate its 69th anniversary of Independence today. It was on February 4, 1948 that Sri Lanka gained Independence from the British. Freedom would not have been possible without a group of heroic individuals who risked their lives for the sake of liberation. So it's time to reflect upon some of the Freedom Fighters, who worked hard to free the country from the clutches of the colonial masters.

FEATURE: Honoured gift from the colonial masters
Going back to its beginnings in the pre independence era, it will be of immense use to know the historical background that led to the emergence of the most prestigious institution, the University of Ceylon, Peradeniya, noted for its historic glory and cultural heritage. It will be of great importance to the past as well as the present generation of undergrads to go back to the scenario that brought about the origin of this unique institution. It rich historic legacy is keenly felt even today, in its atmosphere as a worthy institution which has a surprising way of living for decades as it was originally created. Its stature possesses such power that any passer-by or any fresher (new) student might want to delve deep into the past to its origin. The honour of preserving it to-date is taken over by the time factor and the mighty tradition.
One could say that the University was an outcome of imperialism which we experienced till we gained independence. University education in its initial stages was mostly governed by political considerations during early colonial rule. The education policy then was determined according to the financial resources of the colony and the creation of a University was not given attention until after they stabilized their power in the island (than Ceylon). The need for a University arose much later. The Colombo Academy, which was created in 1853, affiliated to the University of Calcutta, renamed Royal College in 1881, enabled the students to sit for London University external degrees. It was during this time that several colleges established by the religious missionaries, Christian as well as Buddhist provided the opportunity to go for higher education. Their devoted attention leading to excellence in studies elevated the colleges to prestigious position. The secondary schools thus emerged were producing students who had to be provided with higher education, culminated in the demand for University education. At the same time a new era was going to be witnessed.
The Legislative Council as far back as 1870 which truly opposed the earlier mentioned affiliation preferred the British Universities to Indian ones. As it was discontinued, the rich and the affluent just a handful, were happy to educate their children in the United Kingdom. Education then was in the English medium confined to the rich. Fees were charged and University education was beyond the reach of the average. Yet the general opinion of the wealthy was that a local seat of higher learning was a dire necessity. The executive council having discussed the matter, adopted a resolution for the establishment of a University College, so that those who are anxious, could do a degree without proceeding to UK. The outcome was a University College affiliated to the University of London, which was of a no value to the professional elite who were clamouring for an academic model that would make a meaningful contribution to the forward march of the country. It was against this backdrop that there emerged a legendary University of Ceylon. Thus began the great edifice that has spread to many parts of the island as a network continuing to this day.
The University of Ceylon was set up in Colombo, under the British in 1942 until the premises were prepared at Peradeniya. At this juncture, Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara, respected as the father of free education, during his tenure as the Minister of Education in the State Council (1931 to 1947) brought about a drastic change in the sphere of education. Along with his greatest contribution  the Free Education scheme, the establishment of the Peradeniya University, the concept of the Central Schools opened the doors of higher education to the poor and the talented.
Thanks to the sincere efforts of the doyen of education, the way was thus paved for the clever, rural intelligentsia to reap the benefits of university education. Now on the completion of the first phase of the University at Peradeniya in 1952, after ten years' stay in Colombo, the first residential university commenced with the arrival of 820 students of the Arts and Oriental faculties. I do still remember how the most esteemed journal widely read, even at that time, the Daily News carried the photograph of their departure to Peradeniya by train. It was a happy occasion for the then Entrance students to watch the scene. They arrived at the haven on earth, the newly constructed majestic university of regal splendor, in a picturesque, scenic location with greenery all round, founded by the intellectual genius  Sir Ivor Jennings. Whatever this may mean, it cannot be denied that this magnificent seat of learning owes its origin to the colonial masters and its legacy lives on.
True Wonder
When it was first inaugurated it was a true wonder and it was the best ever, in this part of the globe. Beautiful memories must be still alive in their hearts and minds. It was set up on the British University model (Oxford, Cambridge) described as the best in the British Empire, following a steady upward journey towards academic excellence. The Tudor style halls of residence were still another example. My memories flash back to our first day in the campus. My friends to this day  Padmini, Winnie, Shiva Beatrice and Chandra when going for a walk in the cool breezy evening, I vividly remember how we met late Dr. Horace Perera, the father figure in History, during our student days. The first question he put to us was Do you feel yourself important Of course that was a wonderful question that enhanced our first impression.
Having served the Motherland in numerous ways, living in retirement, in Switzerland, in his mid 90s he has passed away. May his soul rest in peace. One time glory of the University, still linger in our hearts. It proved its value as the highest academic institution. Study programmes and curriculum then, was the most advanced on par with modern trends and methods, in addition to the excellent facilities provided. There was the strong tradition of quality in every aspect. In short, the University of Ceylon offered the best for everyone.
Transition Post  Independence Era
The decade beginning with 1960 marked the new era. Wealthy and the privileged that dominated the University scene, after independence gradually decreased. It came to be centred on truly bright and intelligent. The introduction of Free education system led to the admission of Swabasha medium students who had to exist with the English speaking elite for sometime.
Competition to seek admission became a feature as the State University could accommodate only a limited number, the concept of external students too had to be considered. On the whole, the role of the University too had to be changed taking many progressive steps to suit the emerging needs in the post independence era. This led to the expansion, extending a historic service, laying the foundation for a network to serve the country. Mahapola Scholarship scheme, the brainchild of Honourable Minister, Lalith Athulathmudali, which opened the doors to the intelligent but economically backward students for university education at this juncture should also be mentioned here. The colourful history of the University of Ceylon does not end here. It has touched the hearts and minds of thousands uncountable, with a deep sense of affection, which is evident from the writer herself.

FEATURE: Independence in retrospect
Sri Lanka which is popularly known as Pearl of the Indian Ocean and also as the Granary of the Orient is endowed with nature's blessings in abundance. She was also known as Thambapanni in the distant past and later as Serendib and eventually as Ceylon. About two thousand and six hundred years ago, this island was occupied by tribes called Yakka, Naga and Deva. It is chronicled that Prince Wijaya together with seven hundred of his friends, arrived at Thammanna and lived with a woman of Yakka tribe, named Kuveni.
His landing in the island coincided with the date of the passing away of the Buddha about 2560 years ago. Prince Wijaya was the eldest son of King Sinhabahu and Sinha Seewali who ruled the country of Lata in India. It has been mentioned that Buddha, on the dais where He was poising himself for His passing away, has asked God Sakra to provide protection to Prince Wijaya and his friends who landed in Lankadveepa. In deference to Buddha's words, God Sakra had entrusted God Upulwan to do the needful and God Upulwan gave protection to them and the country as recorded in Mahawansa.
Administrative structure 
It is believed that Prince Wijaya and Kuveni had two children, one daughter and one son from whom the Adivasi generation of this island commenced to exist. Although Prince Wijaya later married a daughter of the ruler of the Pandyan Kingdom, no children were blessed from that wedlock. With the death of Wijaya, for a period of one year, this country remained without a ruler.
As wished by Wijaya, his brother Summiththa, the then ruler of Lata, sent his son by the name of Panduwasadewa to Lankadveepa and arrived at Kodannathiththa Port. King Suddhodhana the father of Prince Siddhartha had a brother by the name of Amithodhana whose grand-daughter Baddakachchyana came to this land during that period and eventually she entered into wedlock with Panduwasadewa holding his coronation in the island. Therefore it is evident that the Sinhala race descends from the dynasty of Panduwasadewa and Baddakachchayana.
According to Mahawansa, King Wijaya and his men transformed Anuradhapura to the capital of the kingdom and laid the foundation for the setting up of a prosperous State. Those men who accompanied Prince Wijaya set up colonies and took part in the then administrative structure. When King Dewanampiyatissa was the monarch during the Anuradhapura era, Emperor Asoka was ruling India. It so happened that they forged a strong bond of friendship between Emperor Asoka and King Dewanampiyatissa which resulted in the introduction of Buddhism to this island, as a glorious gift of the Emperor Asoka as chronicled in Deepawansa. According to Deepawansa, Emperor Asoka had sent a message to Dewanampiyatissa mentioning that, I seek refuge in Buddha, Dhamma and Sanga. I shall become a faithful layman of Sakyamuni doctrine. Hence you are well advised to seek refuge in the Triple Gem. This is a sublime doctrine. As such, seek refuge in the Enlightened One.
The arrival of Arahant Mahinda, the son of Emperor Ashoka records the establishment of the Buddasasana, the Order of Buddhism, in this country. Later the arrival of his sister Sangamitta who brought with her a sapling of the Sri Maha Bodhi followed by the setting up of the Order of Buddhism nuns (bhikkuni) in Sri Lanka. Thereafter Buddhist temples and stupas were constructed for the worshipping of the Buddhist devotees.
The benign social development that occurred as salutary results of establishing the Buddasasana during the Anuradhapura Era, was later weakened by foreign invasions into this country. Commencing from Sena and Guttika, the South Indians traders followed by Dravidian and Chola invaders, worsened the situation.
As a result of constant invasions from South India, Royal dynasty of our country moved from Anuradhapura to other areas such as Yapahuwa, Dambadeniya, Kurunegala, Gampola, Kotte and Kandy. During the Kotte Era, Sri Lanka was subjected to western invasion. In 1505, the Portuguese invaded the coastal areas of the island. This resulted in remarkable changes taking place in the social, cultural and religious spheres of the island.
These invaders who entered the maritime areas propagated their religion and consolidated their domination while resorting to exploitation of the countries that came under their sway and occupation. Nor was that all, they saw to it, that their cultural systems were infiltrated into the countries that they captured. They also converted the Maritime Provinces to centres of spice trade and thereby nourished their own State by what they plundered from the countries they conquered. The Portuguese in Sri Lanka did not stop at flourishing that trade in the island, but also in a subtle manner they infused their religious and cultural systems into the country, thereby bringing about radical, social and cultural changes. The Dutch, who invaded the coastal areas of our country in 1656, transformed the island into a commercial centre and also saw to it that their religion took roots in the country. This endeavour of theirs had wide influence upon the social and cultural trends in Sri Lanka.
Kandyan Kingdom 
The British captured the Dutch-occupied areas of the country in 1796. The British adopted a different strategy to capture not only the coastal areas but also the entire island. To achieve this objective, they ensured that the kingdom of the hill country collapsed by unleashing plots to weaken the administration of the kingdom.
The Sinhala Chieftains, who got deceived by the machinations and the manipulations of the English, allowed them to conquer the Kandyan Kingdom which culminated with the capture of King Sri Wikrama Rajasingha, the last king of the country and they entered into Kandyan Treaty on March 2, 1815. The Kandyans supported the English to rid the Kandyan Kingdom from the Nayakkarr Dynasty. But the national independence which our forefathers protected at tremendous sacrifices, was never bargained for the betrayal of their heritage, traditions, culture and customs. The Kandyan aristocrats visualized a dream of establishing a Sinhala dynasty under Ehalepola with the assistance of the English. The Kandyan hierarchy's aim was to protect the country, the nation, Buddhism and the venerable Tooth Relic under an administration well disposed towards the aspirations of the Sinhalese.
Three years after the Kandyan treaty, many of the conditions laid down in it were violated by the British. The provision in the treaty solemnly pledging to protect the Buddhist Order, Buddhist places of veneration as stipulated in the 5th Article, were blatantly violated. This triggered off the first independence struggle against Europeans in our country. The Kandyan rules who had to retreat under the pressure of the English machinations later had to eventually be the prisoners of the English. This independent struggle which ended in bloodshed and volumes of tears, culminated with in the destruction of entire Uva Wellassa. It should be noted that Uva Wellassa, where the struggle began, got irreparably damaged with its consequences running into centuries.
Executive powers 
In 1848 the second independent struggle broke out in Matale, in the hill country, but unfortunately it was unsuccessful. The Sinhala leaders discarding the idea of wresting back the independence by arms and a struggle, resorted to sharing the powers of administration with the English. The result of it was the arrival of Colebrooke-Cameron Commission which introduced many administrative changes in 1833. Colebrooke and Cameron who were ardent liberals firmly believed that the State should not interfere in economic and social activities. They did not mean that people should be given economic and social independence. Rather their belief was to enable the British entrepreneurs to extract maximum profits from our resources.
The British administration saw to it that there were many radical changes which resulted in the eradication of the Rajakariya system (feudalism). They also wanted to ensure that the agricultural economy based on tea and coffee initiated by the British capitalist class becomes stronger and therefore facilities were provided for that purpose including the bringing in labourers from India. They re-demarcated the country into five provinces, instead of the sixteen that had been there in the past. They introduced an English education system and a judicial system all over the island.
The most significant of the recommendations was the curtailing of unlimited executive powers of the Governor and the transfer of such powers to the legislature consisting of 15 members including three representatives of Sinhalese, Tamils, Burghers and three for the Europeans. That was the first occasion where the Sinhalese got an opportunity to have their representation.
However, the representation the Sinhalese expected was not discernable in the changes recommended. In the basic changes brought about in the economy was the creation of an economy based on money. The emergence of a local commercial class and the economy depending upon imports and exports also saw the light of day. This resulted in the Kandyans facing an acute shortage of lands and the agricultural economy collapsed with some other significant adverse changes. Sri Lankans were not satisfied with the changes effected and therefore the Sri Lankan leaders sought to get more administrative powers to satisfy the needs of the country. Therefore they wanted to obtain broader representation for the Sri Lankans and more powers in the new administrative set up.
Although there were only five provinces till 1889, the number was increased to 9 for the purpose of administration and it remains so even today. This system introduced by the English, ensures the establishment of a unitary system of administration. These changes brought about the liquidation of State monopoly on trade and introduced free trade and the systematization of English education for the purpose of training Sri Lankans for State administration. These resolutions were effected by an Executive Committee comprising a Secretary for the Dominion, Service Chief and the Attorney General with the Governor presiding over the meetings. In 1889, they increased the number of unofficial representations to eight by adding a representative for the Kandyans and one for the Muslims.
Political and economic goals
For the purpose of achieving political and economic goals, Sri Lankans established the Low Country Planters Association, the Chilaw Association, and the Sri Lanka National Association. In the early part of 20th century, these organisations demanded more constitutional reforms since 1833 to 1910, the population of Sri Lanka had increased sharply and also the income and there had been major constitutional changes in Malta, Mauritius Islands, Cyprus and Jamaica, allowing them to elect their own representatives. They argued that they should effect changes in keeping with the spirit of modern times. In Sri Lanka the argument continued, should have the right to their own representatives and their own legislation. They further recommended that the Governor should not preside over the meetings of the Legislature.
Another recommendation they advanced was that the Legislative Council should have full financial control. But the then Governor Henry McCullum had informed that such recommendations should be ignored. But the Secretary in-charge of the Colonies agreed to concede the right to vote for Europeans, Burghers and the educated Sri Lankans. Therefore in 1910, new constitutional changes were recommended. Accordingly 21 members were nominated to the Legislative Council, 11 were officials and 10 un-officials in the new set up. Only educated Sri Lankans hailing from medical, engineering, surveying, law, notaries were considered eligible Sri Lankans to enjoy the right to vote.
In the meantime a renaissance to restore religion, culture etc, was getting into its stride. Among them Ven. Migettuiwatte Gunananda, Ven. Hikkaduwe Sri Sumangala, Col. Henry Steele Olcott Anagarika Dharmapala, Hevavitharana brothers, Charles Batuwanthudawe, Ven. Battaramulle Subhuti, Walisinghe Harischandra were the outstanding personages. There were also the leading lights of the temperance movement which were established in 1912, such as F. R. Senanayake, D. S. Senanayake, Sir D. B. Jayathilake, Dr. C. W. W. Kannangara, A. E. Gunasinghe, Piyadasa Sirisena etc who played a very important role in this movement. It was Arumugam Nawalar who gave leadership to Hindu cultural revival, while Siddhi Lebbe played that role for the Muslims.
Donoughmore constitutional reforms 
Although the Colebrooke-McCullum recommendations gave a fillip to political advancement yet, on the whole the Sri Lankans were not happy about the outcome. In 1919 people who wanted more relief and reforms gathered around the Sri Lanka National Congress and they demanded that more members should be elected to the Legislative Council, and franchise should be broad-based, executives should be selected from those elected by the people, the legislature should deal with the annual budget, the Speaker of the Council should be elected by the legislators etc.
In August 1920 there was an agreement on the composition of the Council and number of membership of the council was increased to 37 which consisted 14 officials and 23 unofficial members. Under these constitutional amendments a limited number of people were able to get voting rights, but they constituted only 4% of total population. They still continued representation on a communal basis. This tendency displayed Britain's willingness to rule the country on a communal basis.
However there were many shortcomings in the Manning reforms. The glaring weakness was that the right to franchise was based on education and income. As a consequence of this dissatisfaction during the period of Governor Clifford, a commission headed by Lord Donoughmore was appointed to go into the reforms required for the country. 1931 was a landmark in the evolution of political history of this country because universal suffrage was extended to the entire people. In the wake of it, welfare measures for the society were implemented and social upliftment were expedited. With that trend, new political philosophies got under way and new political institutions saw, the light of day.
Under the Donoughmore reforms, 50 electorates were set up and there was a definite indication of some degree of self government coming into being. But three major portfolios we reserved for the government nominees, who represented defence, finance and law. Including those three officials the number of members increased to 61.
The State Council set up under Donoughmore constitutional reforms was endowed with legislative and executive powers and enjoyed much more freedom to ensure sound administration. The salient feature of this new set up was the removal of communal representation and the introduction of executive committee system which was a training ground for our representatives to acquire proficiency and efficiency in handling complex ministerial posts which demand great responsibility. However, E. W. Perera in 1932 brought forward eight proposals to contribute to constitutional changes. The State Council accepted all the proposals except the one in regard to the committee system. There were many positive proposals such as the one to curtail the powers of the Governor Andrew Caldecott accepted them and on December 22, 1944; a commission headed by Lord Soulbury arrived Sri Lanka. Mr. D. S. Senanayake who was the Leader of the Council represented Sri Lanka and in the discussions he maintained that the Governors power should be curtailed and an Upper House called the Senate should be set up and that our country should be given Dominion status. The white paper regarding this matter was forwarded in November 1944. There were 51 votes in support of it and 3 against it. Therefore on May 15, 1946 and Sri Lanka Constitutional Legislation was proclaimed by a Royal Order.
Commonwealth countries 
The very wide powers conferring upon the country's legislature under the Soulbury constitution were proclaimed on July 10th 1947, a general election was to be held in consequent to it. Accordingly 95 members were to be elected and six to be nominated. In terms of the Soulbury Constitution, the Legislature was called the Parliament. The Parliament was to be composed of three institutions, the King of England, the House of Representatives and the Senate alias the Upper House. Under the Soulbury Constitution the Governor was the nominal executive and the representative of the British Monarch. He was to be appointed on the advice of the Prime Minister. The Senate was to comprise 30 members.
Under the Independence Act, the Parliament had full powers of introducing new laws and to replace the Governor -General, the power to sign international treaties and to appoint governmental officials etc. By then S. J. V. Chelwanayagam has severed his connection with the Tamil Congress and formed a new party called Federal Party. He instead of supporting a Unitary State, clamoured for a Federal State. The new era of the common man dawned with S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike coming into power in 1956.
It is also significant that the new government established diplomatic relations with socialist countries in addition to the existing relations with the commonwealth countries. Taking into consideration the claims made by minority Tamils, both S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike and Mr. Dudley Senanayake made every possible endeavour to enter into a pact with Chelvanayagam for the purpose of resolving differences, but unfortunately they failed due to various influences and interference.
Sirimavo Bandaranaike came into power in 1970 obtaining two thirds majority in the Parliament and the First Republican constitution was adopted in 1972. Through it, we severed our last vestige of Dominion Status of Britain and obtained full freedom. According to the new constitution adopted on May 22, 1972, Sri Lanka was made an Independent Sovereign Republic. There after the Prime Minister and the Cabinet of Ministers performed in a system similar to that of the Westminster Model.
1972 Republican Constitution had conferred Buddhism the foremost place and guaranteed to protect it, and to foster it's a governments responsibility while protecting and safeguarding the rights of the other religions. Article 18 categorically guaranteed that the law should be absolutely and impeccably fair and reasonable to every citizen and that one could enjoy freedom of thought and conscience, freedom and to profess any religion, the right to live in any part of the country etc. Guaranteeing of such rights could be seen as a very desirable trend.
In 1977, exercising its 5/6 majority, the UNP Government elected, pledged to establish a righteous society under the 1978 the Second Republican Constitution. It sought to strengthen State institutions which had been sluggish, up to then. Executive Presidential System with absolute executive powers was created. Very wide constitutional reforms were introduced to bring about desirable changes in the economic, social and political spheres. This Second Republican Constitution had both desirable and undesirable changes upon the Sri Lankan society. The open economic policy adopted by the government to expedite the process of development could not reach the expected beneficial results mainly due to fact that the country had to face a very cruel, and prolonged war. Sri Lanka in order to establish a strong democratic country strove to reach development targets. At times many amendments were brought in a very short period thereby creating serious crises and adverse consequences.
Historic political revolution 
The adoption of the 17th Amendment to the Constitution in 2001 became very impressive as it introduced a constitutional council and independent commissions to ensure the smooth functioning of the government administration in compliance with the values and norms of democracy. In 2010 the 18th Amendment was enacted abolishing the 17th Amendment with a view to achieving the personal and selfish ambitions of the powers-that-be. This amendment cast a black path on the fabric of political history of our country and thereby turned our political scenario topsy-turvy.
The 19th Constitutional Amendment was enacted abolishing the 18th Amendment and brought in independent commissions to fulfil the aspirations of the people and to consolidate democracy. This was the result of the historic political revolution that took place on January 8, 2015. The 19th amendment is the high watermark of democratic evolution of the country.
During the last seven decades after the independence, our efforts to establish a peaceful State underpinned by sustainable development have been made inefficient and ineffective by the 30 year war and also by the insurrections in 1971 and in 1987/88 we had to encounter. More than 60 thousand lives were devoured by this devastating war and it unleashed a near total destruction to our economy. Government's lacking adroitness, have followed inimical economic policies to such an extent, that we are now caught in the debt trap of enormous of foreign debts.
The present government which has vowed to establish a righteous society is determined to take a new course of action to bring about reconciliation among the communities and to ensure sustainable economic growth, to uphold the rule of law, to ensure the independence of the judiciary, to protect and safeguard democratic rights, the right to information etc. Further the Government is committed to effect transition in the country to ensure the establishment of a law-abiding State which upholds the tenets of justice.
The extension of the blessings of the people for the first time to form a National Government with the key role to be played by the two main political parties could be considered a landmark in the history of the country. It is indeed very significant that all possible measures have been taken to restore democracy while ensuring the independence of the judiciary and upholding the rule of law, which would protect and safeguard the salient features and values of democracy and transforming a country plunged into wilderness, vibrant again in the light of democracy and freedom.
So far, even after the lapse of 69 years after independence, we have failed to realize the vision of our forefathers. We have to attribute it to the unfortunate situation prevailing in the country.
Now we have pulled ourselves out of that dark period and are heading towards an era of prosperity where there is lasting communal amity which would finally bring about sustainable economic development.
Therefore let us think in a sense of brotherhood, sinking all our differences, such as caste, colour and creed and join hands with one another in a spirit of goodwill as Sri Lankans. Time is opportune for us to usher in a new era where all can live in peace and harmony.
Chiran Jayatu Sri Lanka!

FEATURE: Long march to freedom
Sri Lanka gained independence from the British on February 4, 1948, after nearly 150 years of British rule. That is a fact that everyone knows, but most people tend to forget that the country was subjected to colonial rule for a much longer period. Two other colonial powers held sway over various parts of the country from 1505 onwards - the Portuguese and the Dutch. Like the British, they too were naval powers that went in search of trading posts and colonies. Although Spain and France were also in this business, they did not turn their attention to Sri Lanka all that much.
Sri Lanka's strategic position attracted many invading powers - our history is replete with examples of armies coming from India and occupying various parts of the country in ancient times. Long before the European powers came, Sri Lanka was known for the spice trade and featured on the maritime Silk Route. Indian, Malay, Arabic and Chinese maritime traders did a brisk trade in and around Sri Lanka.
Enchanted
Explorers from Marco Polo to Fa Hsien have detailed how they were enchanted by this little island in the Indian Ocean, called Serendib and Zeylan. What attracted the country to European naval powers later was its prime location, ideal for a trading and defensive post. This is how Colombo evolved as a prime maritime hub in the world in around 500 years.
Sri Lanka's tryst with colonialism began in 1505 with the arrival of the Portuguese, who introduced Christianity to the island. The locals were enamored with Portuguese names, which survive to this day, from de Silva to Fernando. A lot of Portuguese words entered the vernacular languages, from Paan (bread) to Camisa (Shirt) to Vidro (Veeduru, Glass). These are remnants of the Portuguese rule in Sri Lanka which lasted from (or Ceylon as it was called prior to becoming a Republic in 1972).
The first Portuguese sailor to set foot in Sri Lanka was Laurenco de Almeida (1505) who has been immortalized in a local baila song as a good hearted sailor. Another legend has given rise to the pithy Sinhala proverb Parangiya Kotte Giya Wagey (How the Portuguese went to Kotte) which refers to the circuitous route taken by the King's men to take a Portuguese delegation to Kotte, the local seat of power. Although the Portuguese sent reinforcements from time to time to strengthen their hold on the island, they could not gain control of the entire island including Kandy. Nevertheless, they held important maritime cities such as Colombo, Negombo, Kalutara and Galle.
Dutch rule
The Dutch entered the island in 1603. Dutch Admiral Joris van Spilbergen arrived in Ceylon with three ships after a 12-month voyage. Their first port of call was Batticaloa, which the Portuguese never occupied and they established a link to the King who was based in Kandy. However the Portuguese managed to take over Kandy in 1611 and Trincomalee in 1624, followed by Badulla in 1630 which was completely destroyed. They were heavily outnumbered by the Sinhalese Army on the return journey and suffered a massive defeat. The Portuguese rule in Sri Lanka came to an end in 1658, but many of their customs, religious practices and words remain in the island. There is a very small community that speaks a version of Portuguese Creole, which is distinct from the island's two main languages.
The Dutch period in Sri Lanka began in 1658 and lasted till 1796, although there was a certain period in the initial stages when both had a presence in the island. Just like the Portuguese, the Dutch left a lasting impression on the island, from the Burgher community to the Roman Dutch Law. The Dutch were also known to be much more accommodating than the Portuguese, who had ransacked many villages and towns. Many structures they built still stand intact or in parts. The Dutch had a reputation for being traders and in fact, their main trading arm was the Dutch East India Company. The Kandyan King signed a treaty with the Dutch to evict the Portuguese from the island in 1638 and the Dutch captured Colombo in 1656. Note that these events must be seen in a wider context, since all the naval powers were trying to exert their influence over the entire Asian region. For example, the Dutch were also having a foothold in India and Indonesia at the same time.
British dominance
At this time, the British were looking to establish their dominance in the region and Ceylon was a big prize. The Dutch were mired in military and political problems in Europe, which paved the way for Britain to enter Sri Lanka peacefully. Although Britain entered Sri Lanka in 1796, they took control of the entire island only on March 2, 1815. The British also agreed to protect Buddhism, the religion practiced by the majority of the local population.
The British left their mark on Sri Lanka, developing a network of roads and railway lines, introducing tea and coffee plantations and also much of the backbone of the legal, administrative, armed forces, Police, educational and even political systems (Westminster) now in use. Their biggest legacies were the English language, now the country's third or link language and cricket, the sport that has become Sri Lanka's national passion.
They also brought in many British banks and other companies, some of which exist to this day. British Governors from Frederick North to Sir Henry Monck Mason Moore ruled the country until independence. (They still live on in road and place names in Colombo, such as Barnes Place, Maitland Crescent, Torrington Avenue, Campbell Park, Horton Place, Ward Place, Anderson Lane, Gregory's Road, Longden Place, Havelock Place, Manning Town etc)
Many rebellions took place against British rule and some of the local heroes were branded as traitors until very recently, when President Maithripala Sirisena proclaimed them as heroes. There was a massive collective effort to regain independence in line with the independence struggles of neighbouring countries such as India. This newspaper too was in the forefront of the independence struggle, fulfilling the vision of its owner D.R. Wijewardene who campaigned fearlessly for independence. Many heroes sacrificed their lives to regain our independence which we achieved in 1948. Today, Sri Lanka is a sovereign republic that has seen 69 years of freedom.

FEATURE: Post-Independence challenges
Fourth of February every year is a special day for all Sri Lankans. Most of us will eagerly take a break from our busy schedules, watch the Independence parade on TV, read few stories about Independence in the newspapers and, maybe, have a chat with the neighbour about the current political scenario. But when all these things have ended, only a few will have reflected upon the true meaning of independence and the role it has played in shaping our nations character.
Our first Prime Minister, D.S.Senanayake, who was known as the Father of the nation, made it clear in his speech on the first Independence Day that all citizens should work together for the countrys development forgetting ethnic and religious differences.
At that time Ceylon (Sri Lanka) was Britain's model Commonwealth country. After the second world war, it was a good middle-size country with fewer than 10 million people. It had a relatively good standard of education, with 2 universities of high quality, an efficient civil service largely of locals, and experienced politicians in representative government starting with City Council elections in the 1930s.
When Ceylon gained independence in 1948, it was the classic model of gradual evolution to independence and moving up towards prosperity. Alas, it did not work out that way. One of the main reasons was that we did not heed to the advice given by our first Prime Minister and, as a result, we paid a big price for not doing so.
Rights and freedoms
It is easy to take for granted the rights and freedoms we share as Sri Lankans today. However, it is important that we understand and appreciate the hard work and sacrifice that many people  Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims and burghers- made in order for us to enjoy our luxury of freedom.
Freedom and independence are cornerstones in the foundation of our countrys heritage. The independent ideology of the Sri Lankan people is a fundamental element of our society and a key to our nations prosperity. Therefore, we must protect that independence at all cost.
Protection
How do we protect our Independence First, we must ensure the growth and stability of racial harmony. Healing the wounds and building a society in which people of diverse backgrounds live as members of one family are the most pressing issues confronting Sri Lanka today. Our peace, our prosperity, and even our standing in the international community depend on the resolution of these issues.
To build a society in which the rights of all its members are respected and guaranteed, all three races must be animated with the spirit of optimism and faith in the eventual realization of their highest aspirations. Everyone must recognize that unity is essential for their common survival. Everyone must recognize that there is only one nation  Sri Lankan nation. Everyone must recognize that a harmoniously functioning society that permits the full expression of the potential of all persons can resolve the social and economic problems now confounding a society wracked with disunity.
Transformation
It is evident that non-Sinhala groups in large numbers are feeling disappointed and frustrated. They seem to perceive that adequate efforts have not been taken to effect cordial inter-racial and inter-religious relationships. To rationalize this failure, they have been reacting by retreating to the more familiar ground of racial and religious separation.
Racism, in particular, runs deep. It infects the total nation and the hearts of all Sri Lankans alike. Since without conscious, deliberate, and sustained effort, no one can remain unaffected by its corrosive influence, all groups must realize that such a problem cannot be easily resolved.
The transformation of a nation ultimately depends on the initiative and change of character of its citizens. Therefore, on this Independence Day let us advance with an unflinching determination to lend effective support to the resolution of the ethnic and religious issues that are hindering the progress of this country.
Reforms
When we talk about. protecting our Independence, another important matter which needed to be considered is political accountability. Fortunately, President Maithripala Sirisena is a firm believer in the Parliamentary system. As a seasoned statesman, he would have understood that the political accountability is the key to the democratic consolidation, which is an essential requisite for the protection of Independence and sovereignty of the country.
This means, we need reforms that will substantially improve the role, the processes and accountability of our Parliament to the extent that it is not only deliberating, but anticipating, and leading. As a representative institution, our Parliament should not only want to have public confidence in its motives and actions, but should want to genuinely deserve that confidence.
Opportunity
Today, we have a unique opportunity of creating a political system and an environment where nearly all citizens can appreciate and participate in government and politics. This can be done only as long as the idea of political efficacy is built into our parliamentary system. During the last 2 years, Sri Lankans have seen some indication of a democratic government and that should serve as a ringing evidence of how people can be motivated to work for their Government.
We cannot expect citizens to get involved in social development if the politicians practice mindless politics rather than act as honourable and capable men and women. If the politicians themselves do not believe in our countrys ineffable capacity for good governance, how do we expect citizens to extend their support to develop the country.
We need to put the right people to work. We need to cultivate a generation of educated workforce. We need to take the towns to the villages. That is the meaning of true independence. It means taking the road less travelled or sometimes, that unconventional path devising different solutions to our problems.
Patriotism
Independence Day is also about patriotism. On this day, let's reflect upon what we have done for our country and what we still 'can' do. And by so doing, we will have delivered on the sacred promise of our nation to all those who gave selflessly of themselves - the ancestral martyrs to whom this day really belongs.
Independence Day is also an occasion to remember those who died under our national flag fighting against the terror. Lets also reflect on the very genius of our heroes who paved the way for the present generation to continue with peace and dignity. And, if we ever think of honouring them in a more meaningful way, we should commit ourselves to work hard to build our country into a decent place fit for every man, woman or child to live and dream.
Determination
In the midst of all the activities celebrating the Independence Day, we should all pause to remember the true meaning of this most uniquely Sri Lankan event.
We gained independence because of the courage and sacrifice of the men and women from the very first day the colonial powers took our country into their grip. They risked everything to gain for themselves and succeeding generations the blessings of independence. They had no guarantee of success in the centuries that followed and it seemed they were doomed to failure. They did not give up, however, because they would have liberty and, if not, they preferred to die.
That determination to live free or die is why those generations prevailed in their struggle for independence and why Sri Lanka is the land of the free. If we, the beneficiaries of that great sacrifice, are to retain the independence we enjoy today, then we must, first, be eternally vigilant in the protection of our independence and, second, be as willing as our ancestors to give our all in the defence of the sovereignty of the people.

FEATURE: Undying Legacy
Beneath the sacred folds of the glorious banner embossed with the majestic lion, they breathed the air of independence and the gallant hearts that struggled to gain it were finally content.
Sixty nine years back, in 1948 Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) gained Dominion Status within the British Commonwealth for participation in the countrys administration. Don Stephen Senanayake was in the foremost of the peaceful political movement aimed at achieving independence from the British. He is respected as the Father of the Nation, was the first Prime Minister of Ceylon (now Sri Lanka) and held the office till his death.
Born on October 20, 1884 in a village called Botale in the Western Province, Sri Lanka, he belonged to a devoted Buddhist family of Mudaliyar Don Spater Senanayake and Dona Catherina Elizabeth Perera Gunasekera Senanayake. He was the youngest in the family and had two elder brothers, Fredric Richard Senanayake and Don Charles Senanayake and one sister, Maria Frances Senanayake. He received his education from the renowned private Anglican boys school S. Thomas College then situated in Mutwal. Starting off his career as a clerk at Surveyor Generals Department later he left the job to join his fathers rubber plantation.
Temperance Movement
He along with his two brothers, were associated with the Temperance Movement which was formed in 1912, inspired by Buddhism and anti-colonialism. The movement had a leading role in the National Independence Movement in Ceylon. In 1914, at the outset of the First World War, the three brothers joined Colombo Town Guard, a regiment linked with Ceylon Defence Force (predecessor of Sri Lanka Army.) During the 1915 riots, the brothers faced confinement without any charges as Sir Robert Chalmers, the then British Governor held the Temperance Movement as rebellious. As the British resorted to remorseless brutal actions to suppress the riots, the educated middle class of the country emerged to initiate the modern independence movement. In 1919, his brother Fredric Richard formed Lanka Mahajana Sabha party and he along with Don Charles became leading members of the party that played a significant role in the independence of Ceylon.
Member of the Legislative Council
He was elected from Negombo in the Western Province of Ceylon, as a member of the Legislative Council of Ceylon in 1924.Following Fredrick Richards death in 1925, D. S. Senanayake stepped in to lead the independence movement. The Legislative Council of Ceylon was replaced with State Council of Ceylon by the Donoughmore Constitution in 1931 and Senanayake represented Ceylon National Congress in the latter and became Minister of Agriculture and Lands. He strived to resolve the agricultural issues and in this endeavour formed an agricultural policy, Land Development Ordinance, to address rice issues in the country.
The various irrigation schemes of the policy ensured that barren lands were brought under cultivation. His efforts in launching the policy fetched him respect and appreciation and saw him being re-elected in 1936. He went on to serve as in the same capacity for fifteen years during which he focused on modernizing agriculture.
He played an active role in supply and control of food during Second World War in the capacity of a Ceylon war cabinet member and as Minister of Agriculture and Lands. As the nation experienced scarcity of rice due to reduction in foreign supplies, he initiated tenfold import of wheat flour by commencing trade with Brazil and Egypt. He developed a close bond with Dr Ivor Jennings, who served Ceylon University College as its Principal. An authority in constitutional law, Dr Ivor Jennings later became advisor of Don Stephen and gave him valuable suggestions on constitutional reforms paving the way in attaining independence of Ceylon.He became Leader of the House of the State Council of Ceylon on December 2, 1942 and held the position till July 4, 1947.
Ceylon National Congress
He also became Vice Chairman of the Board of Ministers of the council in 1942.When the Whitehall Declaration was made by the British Government on May 26, 1943, regarding constitutional change in Ceylon and attracted submissions from ministers, the Governor called for a commission to stop the operations of ministers. Not consenting to the resolution on independence undertaken by Ceylon National Congress, he left the party and submitted his proposal of dominion status to the commission.
The commission accepted his submissions which were published in 1944 in the Sessional Paper XIV. The Soulbury Commission was set up in 1944 and the following year he visited London and met George Hall, the Secretary of State for the Colonies. This was followed by acceptance of his submissions that led to self-government for Ceylon, albeit short of independence. In 1946, he resigned his ministry and on September 6 that year, he established a new party, the United National Party by bringing together three right pro-Dominion, right-leaning parties from the Sinhalese, Muslim and Tamil communities. The same year he refused knighthood, though showed his appreciation for the cooperation extended by the British.
After a few negotiations, his proposals for change in constitution and independence were accepted by the British government. This was followed by parliamentary elections from August 23 to September 20 in 1947. After a couple of months, in December, the nation witnessed passage of the Independence Bill of Ceylon and on 11th day of the month, he signed agreements with British government that opened a new door of Independence to Ceylon.
Coalition
The UNP went into a coalition with All Ceylon Tamil Congress and formed a government and he became the first Prime Minister of Ceylon on September 24, 1947. He also held Ministry of Defence and External Affairs. As Prime Minister, he was respected by most of the communities of Ceylon. He applied multipurpose scheme, Gal Oya to colonize uninhabited regions by resettling around 2, 50,000 people. He emphasised on development of hydroelectric power to mitigate non-occurrences of coal, oil and gas deposits in the country. In 1950, the British inducted him in the Privy Council. In 1951 he also took charge of the Ministry of Health and Local Government.
D. S. Senanayake married Molly Dunuwila and had two sons Dudley Shelton Senanayake, born on June 19, 1911, and Robert Parakrama Senanayake born on April 8, 1913. Following in his fathers footsteps Dudley Senanayake succeeded his father to become the second Prime Minister of Ceylon on March 26, 1952. Dudley Shelton later held premiership for two more terms.On March 22, 1952, Senanayake succumbed to a stroke that he suffered while riding a horse at the Galle Face green. His legacy continues even at present and Senanayake will always be remembered for his valuable service to the country by all generations.

Federer savours extra special Australian Open win
No male tennis player in history has won as many grand slam titles as Roger Federer, but the Swiss star has dubbed his record-extending 18th major- won at the Australian Open Sunday -- as extra special.
Out injured for six months, ranked No. 17 in the world and enduring a five-year grand slam drought, not many expected the former world No. 1 to progress to the latter stages in Melbourne Park, let alone win the first major of the season.
Federer himself admitted a quarterfinal spot was the best he had hoped for on his competitive return to the Tour following a prolonged absence to recover from a knee injury.
I said the best I can do probably here is a fourth round or a quarterfinal, depending on the draw, and I sit here as the champion. It's really strange to me, the 35-year-old Federer told CNN after he got the better of his old adversary Rafael Nadal over five sets.
The magnitude of it, around beating Rafa in the final, back-to-back five setters, beating three or four top 10 players this tournament, added Federer, who moves to No. 10 in the world rankings after his remarkable win.
I was able to string together so many cool victories. This one is going to feel extra special.
Mental battle
Federer had not played competitively since Wimbledon in July and had not won a grand slam since Wimbledon 2012.
He had beaten three top 10 players -- Stan Wawrinka, Tomas Berdych and Kei Nishikori -- en route to the final, but the odds were against the 17th seed as he faced 14-time grand slam champion Nadal -- a player five years his junior, though also troubled by injuries in recent years.
As the tense final went into a deciding fifth set, Federer needed an off-court medical timeout and momentum seemed with Nadal, but the father-of-four said Sunday's showdown was a mental challenge, rather than a physical one.
I think the first time I actually believed I could win the title was maybe Saturday or Sunday morning, he explained.
I just started seeing flashes of me with the trophy, flashes of me winning and normally I only get that when I start feeling good and I'm in the right mindset.
Otherwise you get flashes of how you do the acceptance speech, but on the loser's side, or how you're going to explain your loss and I don't like it when that creeps into your head. But you can't help it, it just goes like that.
It was more of a mental battle for me in the final than it was a physical one, even though I had to take an injury timeout because my leg's been killing me for the last week or 10 days.
I'm just happy I weathered the storm and was able to find a way when it was most necessary in the fifth set.
Before Sunday's win, it had been 10 years since the Swiss had last beaten Nadal in a grand slam final, while the Spaniard had also won six of their eight grand slam finals and 23 of their 34 previous encounters.
Amid the euphoria of victory, Federer didn't forget to pay tribute to his opponent.
It was a great celebration for tennis as well. Rafa is a great champion and I hope we'll see so much more from him, and I hope he can win the French Open, or come back especially here to Australia and win it because he deserved it as much as I did. -CNN

Fifty percent drop in Indian poaching incidents
There has been a 50 percent reduction in incidents of poaching by Indian fishermen in Sri Lankan waters, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said yesterday.
We have seen fewer cases of bottom trawling ever since we increased the arrests of Indian fisher boats. This has been especially effective since we decided not to return the boats. Earlier, even though the boats were confiscated, they were returned, so trawling continued,the minister said addressing a media briefing at the ministry.
Since 2014, Sri Lanka has refused to release over 100 trawlers that encroached into Sri Lankan waters.
On January 25, an Indian court directed the central government of India to take appropriate measures within two months to retrieve the Indian fishermens boats seized by the Sri Lankan Navy, the minister said.
Minister Amaraweera however rejected such an order and pointed out that it bore no jurisdiction over Sri Lanka, The government will stand firm on its decision not to return boats, he said.
We held several discussions with India last year and the central government agreed that the practices of their fishermen were illegal. They also agreed not to register any new trawlers, Amaraweera said.
According to the minister, the Indian governments initiative to provide alternative livelihoods to those engaging in bottom trawling has also greatly helped in reducing poaching in Lankan waters.
They have diverted around 92 boats into other areas, the minister said.

Former Aussie umpire Lou Rowan dies aged 91
Lou Rowan, the Australian umpire who was at the centre of the 1971 controversy in which England captain Ray Illingworth led his team off the Sydney Cricket Ground, has died at the age of 91.
Rowan officiated in 25 Tests as well as the inaugural one-day international, and was one of Australia's leading umpire through much of the 1960s. Prior to his death he was also Australia's oldest living Test umpire, and away from the game he was a former Queensland drug squad detective.
He was most remembered for the 1971 Sydney Test, during which Rowan warned England fast bowler John Snow for intimidatory bowling to Australia's Terry Jenner. After the warning, Snow was grabbed by a member of the crowd while fielding on the boundary, and Illingworth walked his team off the field in protest.
Rowan instructed Illingworth that England had to resume play or forfeit the match, and play did indeed continue. In his memoir, titled The Umpire's Story, Rowan - who also did not give a single lbw to England during five Tests of that series - said he did not regret his actions on that day.
It is not a happy thought that, as an umpire, I might have been the spark to explode Anglo-Australian Test cricket relations to smithereens, Rowan wrote. But I have no regrets for my part in the affair; I would act no differently in similar circumstances now, whether at club or international cricket level.
Rowan had also been on the field during another controversial moment earlier in his career, although on that occasion was not an antagonist. Standing in his third Test, at the Gabba in 1963, Rowan was at the other end when his fellow umpire Colin Egar called Ian Meckiff for chucking, effectively ending Meckiffs career.

Independence day messages
Nation indebted to forebears for freedom we enjoy : President
Many freedom struggles of humankind have aggrandised the story of human progress. The nation is indebted to our forebears, whose selfless sacrifice of sweat and blood have brought about the freedom in which we breathe today, states President Maithripala Sirisena in an Independence Day message.
The message adds: We Sri Lankans too have inherited a long history of such struggles, that brings forth memories of grief and glory, from the times of our Kings to that of modern democracy.
It is at a challenging and decisive moment, that we celebrate the 69th Independence anniversary this year. The responsibility of strengthening the recently secured democratic freedom, as well as ensuring that, enriched by indigenous wisdom. So that all communities could live with dignity, lies on our shoulders. We have been able to overcome a dark era
and re-illumine our un-surmountable aspirations for democracy, freedom and human dignity. However, the realisation of the true meaning of freedom and independence lies in our potential to free ourselves from the shackles of all kinds and forms of poverty, ill-health, and confines of divisive identities of race, religion and caste and enrich ourselves, as a society that values equity and rights of all.
We are a nation that deserves to live a prosperous life in a country where peace and justice and equality prevail.
It is my sincere wish that we continue to prosper by vanquishing ignorance by knowledge, untruth by truth, hatred by compassion and violence by nonviolence and become a compassionate nation.
Unity paves way for a stronger Sri Lanka : Prime minister
As Sri Lanka celebrates its 69th Independence Day, I believe that we are also celebrating the second anniversary of the election of Good Governance Government,states Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe in an Independence Day message .
The message adds: Only a path that unites all can pave the way for a stronger Sri Lanka, a path that calls for what each of us can give of ourselves to our nation, to our common future and to a better tomorrow.
In order to make the spirit of freedom more meaningful to us all, the Government must take steps that reaffirm the liberties of the people with regard to their economic, social and spiritual well being.
During the last two years, we have been able to achieve many steps in the right direction; restore democratic values, rebuild relationships with friendly nations and affirm mutual trust while focusing on revitaliSing the economy towards laying the foundation for a nation that has overcome various differences and is firmly anchored on principles of freedom and human values.

May we as Sri Lankans possess the courage and the determination to choose that path this Independence Day.
Economic and physical development should be gained with spiritual qualities
Malwathu Chapter of the Syamopali Maha Nikaya of the Mahavihara Ancestry Mahanayake Thera Most Ven. Thibbatuwawe Sri Siddhartha Sumangala
Economic and physical development should be gained with the spiritual qualities based on national and religious reconciliation and coexistence to make use of the independent
It is a pleasure that the government has taken steps to hold a colourful Independence day celebration as usual. The first threat of invasions affected the Sri Lankan sovereignty and independence was from Chola Empire. Subsequently, Portuguese, Dutch, and English invasions have severely affected our independence as well as national, religious, social, academic and cultural aspects. This caused a decline in spiritual aspects and lifestyle of people.
Although 69 years have been spent after the independence, bad consequences of the colonial age have not been completely overcome. The time has come to consider this matter deeply by the leaders as well as the public and it should be understood as their foremost task and responsibility. May all Sri Lankans have the blessings of the Triple Gem and Tooth Relic to enjoy the true meaning of independence.
Independence is wholly a practical process
Asgiri Chapter of the Syamopali Maha Nikaya of the Mahavihara Ancestry Mahanayake Thera Most Ven. Warakagoda Dhammasiddhi Sri Pagngnananda Gnanarathana
I am sending this message of greetings with great pleasure in the moment which the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka is celebrating its 69th independence day.
Independence is wholly a practical process. The independence becomes meaningful when we gain the economic and social freedom. Countries that have gained independence with us and after us have developed into a higher level with exercising this practical process. Social analysts say that the independence of Sri Lanka has not become practical as it is a bestowed one rather than a gained one.
Sri Lankan laic and ascetic leaders have created the environment needed to implement the independent struggle without any racial, religious and caste separation and with the clamorous situation in the country. English rulers had to name Sri Lanka as an independent nation but their objective was to keep Sri Lankans as a divided nation.
Psychological slavery and racist conceptions in Sri Lankan society are a great obstruction to the society. We would not be free from the western slavery until we are liberated from psychological slavery. However, it is a duty of all Sri Lankans to commemorate all ascetic and laic leaders who led the struggle for independence.
I wish on this Independence Day that all could fulfill their obligations to themselves, their families, their religion, their country and their nation in national and religious reconciliation and deviating from narrow politics.
We are far behind the other Asian countries
Sri Lanka Amarapura Maha Nikaya Mahanayake Thera the Most Ven. Davuldena Gnanissara
Sri Lanka, our country, has a written history of about 2,358 years ruled by 182 kings. There were invasions in those days too but they were defeated with the assistance of religious leadership. It is evident in Sri Lankas history that Sri Lanka was completely defeated in March 2, 1815 due to the separations of Sinhalese leaders caused by revenge, and lust to power, wealth and positions. The country was self-sufficient, and it is said that about hundred thousand paddy fields (Wellassa) were in the Monaragala District alone and about 35,000 reservoirs were made to preserve rainwater. It is said that giants were in the country and before 69 years the independence was gained by citizens who are not physical giants but giants with their patriotism. As the country was surrendered by English in 1815, Sinhalese were brave to perform a riot again in 1818. We have such a history.
This is the 69th independence celebration. In retrospect it is clear that we are far behind the other Asian countries who received independence after our country no matter who ruled the country within this period. Hence, I kindly bless on behalf of all the monks that this celebration will open the way to build a united and developed country with a broad dialogue between the rulers and public.
Bless everyone for the well-being of all beings with the power of the Triple Gem!!!!
Independence Day important to all Sri Lankans
Sri Lanka Ramagna Maha Nikaya Mahanayaka the Most Ven. Napana Pemasiri Thera
Independence Day is the day that is important to all Sri Lankan citizens. Sri Lanka became an independent nation on February 4, 1948 after being ruled by Europeans for over four hundred years. It reminds the struggles launched by all Sinhala, Tamil and Muslim leaders with unity. As the unity among ethnic groups has decayed after the independence, all Sinhala, Tamil, and Muslim communities had to experience massive disasters within the past decades. That separation is the main cause that obstructed the economic prosperity of our country. The separation was done by politicians who misled the public to gain their political power. Some who did not realise this truth are doing the same mistake again. I kindly request all citizens to work together by promoting the national reconciliation to overcome the present economic crisis in the country in a moment that the country is being healing after the end of a 30 year cruel war. Religious and political leaders should lead this way. Many of our problems will be automatically solved when the country becomes an economically developed country.
Auspicious occasion for all Sri Lankans
Ramakrishna Mission (Ceylon Branch) Vice-President/Chairman Swami Sarvarupanada
As we all know we are celebrating our 69th Independence day, which is an auspicious occasion for all the Sri Lankan citizens. It is the day when Sri Lanka got freedom from the British rule after many years of hard struggle by the great freedom fighters of Sri Lanka.
This day is of great importance to all Sri Lankan citizens as it gives opportunity to remember all those freedom fighters who had sacrificed their lives just for giving us a beautiful, peaceful and happy life. Freedom is inseparable from responsibility.
Every citizen of Sri Lanka should dedicate and take an oath today, of being highly responsible and well-educated citizens of the tomorrows Sri Lanka. Everyone should sincerely perform his/her duty and do work hard to get the nations goals fulfilled and successfully lead this democratic nation. Sri Lankas rise will be measured by the strength of the religious and cultural values, but it will equally be determined by the economic growth and equitable distribution of the nations resources.
If we have the freedom to think, it is everyones responsibility to think positively. If we have the freedom to speak, it is our responsibility to speak properly and meaningfully. If we have the freedom to act, it is our responsibility to act correctly. If every Sri Lankan could feel responsible in that way, Sri Lanka would be growing more and more in the right direction, then it will be a better place for everyone.
On this happy occasion, I pray to the Lord to shower His choicest blessings on the President Mathripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, all the their Cabinet colleagues, parliamentarians and all the people of Sri Lanka to live with peace, prosperity and happiness.
All should unite with equal rights
Archbishop of Colombo His Eminence Rev.Malcolm Cardinal Ranjith
In this moment which Sri Lanka is celebrating their 69th Independence Day, a great opportunity has occurred to recall the past for creating a better future. There was the responsibility to convert the political independence, which was won through facing various challenges in 1948, into an economic and social freedom for past 69 years. But unfortunately, we were engaged in a war that destroyed a large number of lives and properties as the political field is polluted with a narrow racial and religious separations and we all have suffered throughout the war.
Narrow racial and communal attitudes are not the way to experience the true independence. All should unite as citizens with equal rights to gain the true independence. We should create an atmosphere that enjoys the unity within diversity and that protects needs and self-esteem of all citizens. It is a pleasure that the government led by the President is heading towards that direction.
However, all political parties and opinion should be united to achieve this goal. It could not be gained alone.
Moreover, it is our duty to search for the true independence that protects the culture and civilization of this country by freeing from neo-colonial and globalization trends.
Let us affirm and commit to achieve this aim in this esteemed day. Hail mother Sri Lanka
Wish happier and better future
Bishop of Colombo Rt. Revd. Dhiloraj R. Canagasabey
The Church of Ceylon joins fellow Sri Lankans from all communities and faith groups to greet the nation and to wish our people a happier and better future as we mark our 69th year of independence.
Since 1948, we have travelled a goodly distance as a nation, progressing in many areas such as health, access to primary and secondary education, life expectancy, equal opportunities, and poverty alleviation. We have also made commendable gains. In economic and infrastructure development, in addressing income inequalities, in higher education, although our progress in these areas has been much below our potential.
It is where we have gone wrong and even regressed that has led us to the present moral crisis the country faces.
Indiscipline, dishonesty, corruption, the hunger for power, position and easy riches, the breakdown of the rule of law, mistrust, animosity between various ethnic groups and even the deliberate stoking of racial and religious hatred, these are the moral and ethical faults or sins, which have gradually sapped and devastated the nation from within.
Merely wishing or praying for prosperity and peace does not bring them about. There is a sacred duty cast on all of us, the rulers first and foremost but also on all our citizens to work honestly, sincerely and with dedication to create that country in which we could all live with pride, that Nation the dear homeland of us all. In the words of that great lover of Sri Lanka Rev. W. S. Senior of Trinity College.
But most shall he sing of Lanka
In the bright new days that come.
When the races all have blended
And the voice of strife is dumb
When we leap to a single bugle,
March to a single drum.
To realize this vision, may we all dedicate ourselves this Independence Day.
With Prayers and Blessings
Right to Information : Remarkable victory to be celebrated today
Chief Government Whip of Parliament and Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleka
The most remarkable victory the people of this country achieved to be celebrated on the 69th National Independence day is the legal enactment of the Human Right for Freedom of Information.
The universal right for information that the general public expected from various governments for a considerable period of time has been granted to them by the present government of good governance.
According to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights that reads Everyone has the right to freedom of opinion and expression; this right includes freedom to hold opinions without interference and is to seek, receive and impart information and ideas through any media and regardless of frontiers, the present government has taken steps to grant that supreme rights to the general public. I, hand in hand with the people in Sri Lanka, enjoy the pleasure of submitting the pertinent historical Act.
Freedom is a spiritual requirement. Not only humans but also the animals yearn for freedom. It is quite natural that they get uneasy when the freedom is either restricted or disturbed. Therefore, personal freedom may be considered as the pioneer in social progress.
It is because Sri Lankans are a nation praising freedom in its every aspect, that this motherland never experienced a lack of heroes ever ready even to make the supreme sacrifice for freedom in their struggle to gain it.
The freedom for dialogue, expression and information are essential factors in maintaining respect and self-esteem of the human kind which needs to be safeguarded for democracy.
I would like to pay tribute of the nation to all patriots who fought and sacrificed their lives for freedom of their motherland.
Pay tribute to all heroes of Mother Lanka
Public Administration and Management Minister R. M. Ranjith Madduma Bandara
At this remarkable juncture when our country proudly celebrates the 69th anniversary of independence, I would like to pay the tribute of the nation to all heroes of Mother Lanka who sacrificed their blood, sweat and lives to win the freedom for the whole nation. The epochal mission carried out by the countrymen as one nation to liberate the country from the yoke of colonisation, which had been our fate for centuries, and to build a sovereign country should be commemorated.
However, we should ask ourselves whether we have been successful in our effort to maintain unity, which we had proved during the struggle for independence. We are still struggling with a number of issues for which we should find sustainable solutions as one nation even after lapse of 69 years from the independence.
The poverty emerges as one of the main issues. Building a concrete trust among nationalities, formulation of national policies for sustainable development as well as establishment of reconciliation within the country are the important matters, which demand priority. Even under such challenges, still there are certain aspects of which we can be satisfied. Today, the two main political parties have set a good example leaving behind their different political views and working together in one and the same mission for the progress of the country. The government, which was elected in order to alleviate poverty, the major issue of the country, has declared this year as the year of alleviating poverty. Therefore, this year will open avenues to provide long lasting solutions to several burning issues of the country. At this juncture, it is a great achievement that we could win significant democratic rights within a short period such as the right to information and the right to express ideas for the well-being of the country and people.
The reality we should understand correctly as a country is that the capability of our nation depends on the unity of all nationalities devoid of political divisions and the unity is the only mean through which we can face all the challenges successfully. The example given by the political authority should be followed by all nationalities in our country.
The first condition of our effort to make the mission a success is unity among people. Therefore, we must understand that any split means the destruction of the country.
If we need to emerge as a proud nation, we should make every effort to step forward as one nation.
Therefore, at this remarkable juncture where Sri Lanka celebrates the 69th Independence Day, I take this opportunity to wish the Sri Lankan nation courage and vision to build our country ensuring mutual respect and safeguarding the dignity of country.
Much expectation for this year ushering reconciliation
Opposition Leader R. Sampanthan
I have great pleasure in sending this message of good wishes on our 69th Independence Day.
There is much expectation that this year will usher reconciliation amongst all people in this country on the basis of equality and dignity which will enable them to be true beneficiaries of democracy.
This is essential for the benefit of all people in our country. Though violent conflict has come to an end, the causes of the conflict yet need to be addressed.
The countrys future depends on these issues being addressed on the basis of a reasonable and acceptable consensus. We should all pledge to extend our utmost cooperation to this joint endeavour in the best interests of our country.
Wishing everyone happiness and prosperity.
We are celebrating true independence today
Home Affairs Minister Wajira Abeywardana
This is the second Independence Day celebration commemorated under the incumbent unity government of Sri Lanka. At this moment of time we are celebrating true independence, we should recall with gratitude our national heroes who gave leadership and committed themselves selflessly to the struggle to free the country from the yoke of two centuries of colonial rule and our valiant war heroes who made the ultimate sacrifice to liberate the country from the clutches of brutal terrorism.
All these victories were achieved when we remain untied; not divided. Similarly, as is evidence from history, future challenges can only be surmounted by working in unison like the links of a chain. Therefore, we celebrate 69th Independence Day with the objective of ushering in national unity fostering national reconciliation and achieving democracy and development goals.
Following the genuine democratic space that was crated in the aftermath of January 8, 2015, the national and political reconciliation was steered towards a new direction thanks to the sheer commitment and dedication of President Maithripala Sirisena and the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. The immediate as well as far-sighted vision of our government is to realise the dream of a Sri Lanka where people can enjoy economic, social, political and cultural freedom to the fullest and to fulfill the aspirations of people for a flourishing and prosperous future enabling the achievement of scientific victories.
In accord with a decision taken by our government to promote national reconciliation, the national anthem was sung in Tamil at the 68th Independence Day national ceremony.
That decision, which won widespread plaudits from all concerned, will be implemented unchanged in the future.
The all important goal of our government is to bring the national programme of Beginning of the third year of a sustainable era implemented under the theme of the President for the realisation of development plans and sustainable development goals during the next three years to crate a thriving and prosperous country to fruition.
Impressing the importance of independence day on our political leaders
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa
We will be marking the 69th anniversary of our independence from colonial rule on February 4 . This is a day on which parents, elders and teachers impress upon schoolchildren and young people the importance of contemplating the significance and value of our independence and sovereignty. Today, however, the need is not to impress upon the younger generation the importance and significance of our independence and sovereignty, but to impress upon our
political leaders the importance and significance of our independence and sovereignty. We celebrate the 69th anniversary of our independence in a situation where it is uncertain whether there would be a country left to celebrate the 70th anniversary.
Present day political leaders are engaged in a feverish quest to dismantle the Sri Lankan state by creating semi-independent provincial administrations with their own police forces and public administration mechanisms. In addition to this the national budgets of 2016 and 2017 have envisaged the sale of virtually every government owned asset from small operations like the Grand Oriental Hotel to the biggest project that our government completed the Norochcholai
power plant. Entire free ports, consisting of the harbours in Hambantota and Trincomalee and the surrounding territories have been put on sale.
All politicians should ask themselves on this 69th independence day whether we gained independence from colonial rule only to divide the unitary state that even the colonial powers had left intact when they left, into unviable provincial units and to sell every valuable national asset we have, to foreigners On this independence day, it is my hope that our political leaders will make an attempt to understand the true meanings of freedom and sovereignty.
Unite to eliminate racism
All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama General Secretary Ash-Sheikh M. M. A. Mubarak
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama has the pleasure in releasing this message of blessings to all citizens of the country on the day of celebrating the 69th Independence Day of our motherland, Sri Lanka.
Let us all unite to eliminate racism from our beautiful country. We should take forward this country towards development and prosperity living in peace and coexistence.
This can be achieved only by defeating racism and establishing unity among the communities.
Our prayers and expectations are that all Buddhists, Hindus, Muslims, and Christians in this multi-ethnic society should strive to achieve prosperity, development and progress by following the respective religious advice and developing the ethic of respecting other religions.
The All Ceylon Jamiyyathul Ulama, therefore, supplicates to the God, the Almighty, to shower His blessings on every Sri Lankan citizen who shall make effort to bring unity, peace, coexistence and reconciliation through which build a prosperous Nation.
People are enjoying fruits of freedom
Muslim Welfare Association of Sri Lanka President M. Faisal Faleel  JP (WI)
On behalf of the Muslim Welfare Association of Sri Lanka, I have the pleasure to issue a message on 69th Independence Anniversary.
We are celebrating this anniversary on the second year of the Yahapalanaya Government. We are pleased to note the governments peace and reconciliations programmes and initiatives to launch development programmes to improve the economy of our country. Since the people are enjoying the fruits of freedom and want to improve other living conditions, we are confidence that the current regime under the leadership of President Mithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe would forge ahead to unify the nation and bring a prosperous era for all Sri Lankans.

Iran denies US wrestling team visas after Trump ban
TEHERAN, Friday - Iran has refused visas for US athletes due to compete in an international wrestling tournament in response to President Donald Trump's travel ban on predominantly Muslim countries, the foreign ministry said Friday.
Considering the policies adopted by the new US administration, the foreign ministry was inevitably forced to refuse travel by the US wrestling team to Iran, spokesman Bahram Ghasemi was quoted as saying by the official IRNA news agency.
The team was due to take part in the event in western Iran from February 16-17.
Trump signed an executive order a week ago barring entry of all refugees to the US for 120 days, Syrian refugees indefinitely and blocking citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen from entry for 90 days. The order, which caused mayhem worldwide and has been met with legal challenges, was later clarified to say that green card holders were not targeted by the ban.
Iran on Thursday rejected a warning from Trump over its latest missile test as baseless and provocative, reflecting growing tensions between Tehran and the new US administration.

Kandy-Havies will be down to the final whistle
It is a crucial match for table leaders and defending champions Kandy SC and title chasing Havelock SC as they go into the Dialog A division league game having prepared and in peak form and with a better mind-set at Havelock Park under lights tomorrow. Both clubs know it is a big game, but they will need to keep calm heads and the approach right. These two clubs are placed first and second in the table, level on points and the winner will pocket the league title. When the sides met earlier this season at Nittawela, Kandy SC won.
The Park clubs under the guidance of a Kandy product Ronnie Ibrahim are in the best position that the club has ever been in. He has the knack of producing champions and it will be no different this time round. Havelock SC currently are in top form, having lost only once this season. Even the best of teams are known to have off-days.
It is just how you respond that will finally matter. Kandy S.C. coach Sean Wijesinghe says he is going into this game well prepared and with a better mind-set. We know it is a big game, but we need calm heads and the approach must be right. We have to adapt to the weather and understand that they have been on the back of a thumping and so they are going to want to put things right as well. Kandy's hopes will be boosted with the return of their skipper Roshan Weeraratne who had to skip two games and Nigel Ratwatte who has been out since the start suffering a nasty leg injury.
Old Trinitians beat Present
In a fast well contested game of rugger the Old Trinitians led by B. Karunatilake beat the present boys by 24 points to 22 in their annual encounter which was played last Saturday at Pallekelle.

Lack of grounds hits schools sports
Sports is compulsory at schools, sad to say most of the cricket and rugby playing schools lack grounds for matches and are finding it difficult to play their matches. In the early days a hand full of schools were involved in sports and they had no problem today every school is into cricket and rugby. The cost of ground maintenance is high and they have to charge a fee. What the Sports Ministry should do is upgrade the Bogambara Stadium for rugby and come up with a cricket ground for school matches. The ground fees charged for both sports are at five star level and some schools can't afford it.
School cricket
St. Sylvester's College was beaten by Gurukula College Kelaniya by ten wickets. This match was to be played in Kandy but due to grounds being unavailable they played in Kurunegala. Akurana Azhar College beat Kurunduwatte Royal College by an innings and Katugastota Antonians drew with Matara Thomians.

NARA to undertake study on fish stocks
A study on Sri Lankan fish stocks is to be undertaken for the first time by the National Aquatic Resources Research and Development Agency (NARA) to assess the countrys fisheries resources.
The last tudy was undertaken in 1982, NARA Chairman Dr. Anil Premaratne said at a media briefing at the Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Ministry yesterday. We have observed a great reduction in the coastal fisheries industry over the last several years.
This is due to factors such as climate change, bottom trawling, or illegal fishing methods, Dr. Premaratne said.
He said NARA would introduce a method called ocean ranching- a type of fish farming where juvenile fish are released into the ocean to grow unprotected and unassisted to be subsequently harvested.
Once this is done, the NARA fish survey would be able to inform the fishermen the types of fish high in supply and those that need to be protected. "It will also increase our overall fish stocks," he said.
An MoU has been signed with Norway for the project. The NARA also developed cheap fish food and had invited industry to partner with it to produce it commercially.
A kilo of this fish can be sold at Rs. 140 compared to the imported fish food which costs Rs. 250-280 a kilo.
NARA scientists have also come up with seaweed jelly bottle at Rs. 12. This too awaits investors for commercial production.

New-look Juve await resurgent Inter Milan
MILAN AFP Feb3, 2017 Fit-again Claudio Marchisio could be restricted to starting on the bench as Massimiliano Allegri's new-look Juventus bid to stretch their 27-game unbeaten run at home against Inter Milan on Sunday.
Allegri has both midfielder Marchisio and key defender Andrea Barzagli back from injury lay-offs that have hampered their bid for a record sixth straight Serie A title.
After conceding only two defeats in a tough two-month period, the Turin giants host Stefano Pioli's resurgent Inter armed with a four-point lead on Roma in second, and a game in hand on their five closest pursuers. But although reportedly fit to start, Marchisio isn't needed so desperately yet.
Juventus have run riot in the past three games, all wins, in which injuries to defenders forced Allegri to move away from his preferred 3-5-2 to a more offensive 4-2-3-1.
And from the fans, there have been few grumbles. Despite Juve being outplayed during a 2-1 defeat at Fiorentina a fortnight ago, striker Gonzalo Higuain has hit the net six times in his past five league outings.
In the past three games the Argentine has benefited from the three-pronged support of Juan Cuadrado, Paulo Dybala and Mario Mandzukic.
And with niggling doubts on Marchisio, and Sami Khedira and Cuadrado offering flexibility in midfield, Allegri is expected to deploy roughly the same front line Sunday.
It looks ominous for Inter, who hope to secure their second successive win over the Turin giants following their 2-1 San Siro success last September.
Inter last beat Juventus in Turin in November 2012, yet Pioli's men are on an eight-match winning streak and exciting new Inter midfielder Roberto Gagliardini says Nerazzurri hopes of another exploit are high. We have the belief that we can go there and take the game to them, Gagliardini, who joined Inter on an 18-month loan deal from Atalanta, told Inter Channel.
It's going to be my first match against Juventus and it will obviously be difficult. They're the strongest team in the league but we're going there looking for a result.
A win would send a message to the rest of the league about our top three ambitions. Napoli will leapfrog Roma -- who host Fiorentina Tuesday in a fixture moved due to security concerns -- into second place to sit three points behind Juventus with a win at Bologna in Saturday's only fixture.
Napoli coach Maurizio Sarri welcomes defender Kalidou Koulibaly back from the African Cup of Nations although the fans' biggest cheer could be reserved for Polish striker Arkaduisz Milik, who has fully recovered from a cruciate knee ligament injury suffered last October.
Belgian midfielder Dries Mertens has deputised admirably well after being pushed up to replace Milik, taking his goals tally to 13 in the process, and is likely to start what should be an enticing fixture.
Bologna v Napoli traditionally produces fireworks, the sides claiming four wins apiece and playing to a 2-2 draw in their last nine meetings at the Dall'Ara stadium.
After dropping a precious two points in a disappointing draw with Palermo last weekend, Napoli midfielder Marek Hamsik said: Not winning that game was a blow, but our focus has be right on the next game, against Bologna.
AC Milan coach Vincenzo Montella meanwhile faces a defensive crisis ahead of Saturday's San Siro clash with Sampdoria, with Luca Antonelli and Mattia De Sciglio both ruled out for up to a month and compounding woes after midfieler Giacomo Bonaventura's season was ended by a torn thigh muscle.
Successive losses to Napoli and Udinese have battered Milan's Euro qualification hopes and they sit seventh, 14 points behind Juventus and eight points behind Napoli in third.
Lazio are in the same boat, consecutive defeats to Juventus and Chievo dropping Simone Inzaghi's tiring side to fifth at 11 points behind Juve ahead of Sunday's trip to Pescara.
Fixtures (all GMT) Saturday Bologna v Napoli (1945) Sunday AC Milan v Sampdoria (1130), Atalanta v Cagliari, Chievo v Udinese, Empoli v Torino, Genoa v Sassuolo, Pescara v Lazio (all 1400), Palermo v Crotone (1700), Juventus v Inter Milan (1945) Tuesday

'For the past 10 years, nearly 1,853 new leprosy patients identified in 2016'
Around 2,000 new leprosy patients are being reported every year for the past 10 years. A total of 1,853 Leprosy patients have been identified for the year 2106. Patients are reported from 26 districts in the country, said Acting Director General of Health Services Dr. Jayasundara Bandara.
According to Dr. Bandara, nearly 43 percent of the patients were reported from the the Western Province which amounts to 779 patients. The highest number of cases in 2106 which was 279, were from the Colombo district. Sri Lanka compared to other South East Asian countries, has a high percentage (9 to 10 percent of patients) with visible deformities at the time of diagnosis.
The percentage of children less than 15 years was nearly 9 to 10 percent, indicating active transmission of the disease from undiagnosed Leprosy patients. Child cases were high in districts such as Colombo, Gampaha and Galle, he said.
Nearly 50 percent of the patients were diagnosed more than six months after appearance of symptoms indicating lack of awareness among the public. Therefore awareness raising was very important, especially for school teachers, he added.

Pietersen fined over Big Bash mic comment
SYDNEY, Friday  Former England captain Kevin Pietersen has been charged with a code of conduct breach in Australia's Twenty20 Big Bash League and fined, Cricket Australia said on Friday.
He was reported for breaching CA's code of conduct in making a comment detrimental to the interests of cricket while playing for Melbourne Stars against the Perth Scorchers in a BBL semi-final in Perth on January 24.
The offence occurred during the Scorchers innings, when batsman Sam Whiteman was given not out following an appeal for caught behind by the Stars, and Pietersen commented on the umpire's decision while wearing a microphone on-field.
Pietersen was heard to say during the television coverage when Whiteman appeared to edge a ball from paceman Scott Boland: He says it could have been glove or pad, and I said: well, he's got big gloves and big pads to reach that -- massive nick.
After the match, Whiteman admitted he had hit the ball, while the match umpire Shawn Craig also conceded he had made an error.
Under the code procedure, match referee David Talalla considered the umpires report and the proposed sanction was a Aus$5,000 ($3,800) fine. Pietersen accepted the charge but elected to dispute the sanction. The match referee set a hearing for Thursday and announced the decision was upheld Friday.
Pietersen now has 48 hours to decide whether to appeal and have the matter heard by a CA code of conduct commissioner. AFP

Pietersen pulls out of IPL auction
NEW DELHI, Friday  Former England captain Kevin Pietersen ruled himself out Friday of the lucrative Indian Premier League Twenty20 tournament, saying he needed a breather after a packed schedule in recent months.
Pietersen, 36, played for the Rising Pune Supergiants franchise in the 2016 edition but could only manage four games before missing the rest of the competition with a calf injury. FYI - I won't be going into the IPL auction. My winter has been too busy with all my travel & I don't want to spend April/May away too!, Pietersen announced on Twitter.
The explosive batsman plied his trade in South Africa's domestic T20 competition last year before playing a big part in taking Melbourne Stars to the semi-finals of Australia's Big Bash League. He also played for the Quetta Gladiators in the inaugural season of the Pakistan Super League in 2016 and is set to be part of the team once again for the upcoming tournament in February-March.
The tenth edition of the IPL is scheduled to begin in the first week of April and the auctions should take place at the end of this month.

Rangers have big game mentality, insists Warburton
GLASGOW AFP Feb3, 2017 Mark Warburton insists Rangers can handle the pressure of big games after he faced questions about his side's poor away record.
The Glasgow giants were hammered 4-1 by Hearts on Wednesday as they fell to their second defeat at Tynecastle this season.
Warburton's side have a poor record at the homes of the teams that are around them in the top six of the Scottish Premiership and have lost away to Celtic and Aberdeen, as well as drawing with St Johnstone.
In Warburton's first season in charge, the Ibrox side won the Championship but lost all of their away games against both Falkirk and Hibernian, who finished second and third in the second tier.
Defeat against Hearts left Warburton's side 25 points adrift of rivals Celtic and just two ahead of Aberdeen, who have a game in hand, but the Gers boss says he doesn't think his side have any real issues away from home.
I don't think there is a problem with big games. I don't see it as a big problem, Warburton said.
We went to Aberdeen and I felt dominated and we should have won the game.
We have gone to all these various other venues, Inverness, Partick, Dundee, Motherwell, we have won games of football very convincingly.
The Parkhead game (September's 5-1 defeat by Celtic) was well documented and at Hearts, we had two bad performances, it's as simple as that.
We then played the same teams at Ibrox and were very convincing in what we did.
So, that's football, and what we have to do is learn. Everyone is human, we make mistakes, and have bad days at the office for want of a better term, but we have to learn from it.
Are we worried about going to those grounds Not at all, absolutely not. Rangers have little time to dwell on their defeat and will continue their league campaign at home to Ross County on Saturday, with the previous meetings of the sides this season ending in draws.
We're looking at the game from last night and we can't sweep it under the carpet, Warburton said.
You look at it, ask some blunt questions and hope you get better for it. Plain and simple.
Whether you play the top of the table or the bottom of the table, it's three points.
You don't get five for beating someone and two for beating someone else.
So the fact we are sitting second in the table tells you we are doing some things okay. We have to improve, of course we do, but the fact is the team is growing and we are learning. Runaway league leaders Celtic will be hoping to clinch their 19th consecutive league victory when they take on St Johnstone at McDiarmid Park on Sunday.
The Hoops, who are unbeaten in 28 matches since the start of the season, could have Moussa Dembele and Tom Rogic available for the game after injury.

Ranjan Ramanayake uses RTI on Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat

Social Empowerment Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has made use of the Right to Information (RTI) Act to obtain information on soil and sand excavation permits from the Divulapitiya District Secretariat.
Just signed a RTI request to get info (sic) from Divisional Secretariat about all soil and sand excavation permits in Divulapitiya. Everyone should use RTI, the Deputy Minister tweeted.
The move comes no sooner than the RTI Act came into effect on February 3, 2017, after the Bill was unanimously passed in Parliament on June 24, 2016 and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya placed his signature on the Act on August 4, 2016.
The Divulapitiya District Secretary and Deputy Minister Ranjan Ramanayake clashed last week, when the Minister questioned the Secretarys inaction in relation to illegal sand mining in Divulapitiya the past 7 years.
The Right to Information Act permits access to government information; except in 21 instances; with the intention of promoting equitable governance and upholding the tenants of democracy. 
Access to information relating to soil and sand excavation permits can lay bare corruption at the Divulapitiya District Secretariat, as alleged by villagers clamoring against government inaction in the face of illegal mining.

RTI Act in force from yesterday
The Right to Information (RTI) Act came in to force with effect from yesterday fulfilling one of President Maithripala Sirisenas pledges during the last Presidential election campaign.The Act aims to restore transparency and good governance in the country, Parliamentary Reforms and Mass Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said.
Earlier, we had a government that suppressed information whereas now the situation has changed with information freely available, Minister Karunathilaka said. Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, the minister said many previous attempts were made to introduce this Bill, but,they did not succeed. Although Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe obtained Cabinet approval in 2001 as Prime Minister, the government elected in 2004 did not go ahead with it. Even though, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya tried to bring it as a Private Member Motion as an Opposition member on two occasions, the previous government did not let him proceed with it.
This legislation is very strong having received inputs from civil society organisations, academics, journalists and the public. It is now within the top 9 RTI laws in the world. Although, we were the last South Asian to bring RTI, today we are second only to India in terms of its effectiveness, the minister said.
As a government, we are proud that we were able to enforce RTI, a day before the countrys 69th Independence anniversary. This will specially help the media obtain correct information and do the more investigative stories. We have trained information officers by conducting awareness programmes for Ministry Secretaries, Local Government members and public officers to implement this move. Around 1,500 information officers have been appointed to all branches of government to make the RTI more effective, Minister Karunathilaka said. The law was passed in Parliament in August 2016 and the stipulated time frame for its implementation was six months, but, We have done it well before the dead line, the minister said.
Hereafter, February 3 will go down in the history as the day of freedom of information while February 4 is the day our nation gained its freedom. Since this move is still new, it will take some time to streamline the RTI process especially in Schools, the Police and hospitals, he said.
An Information Bureau has been established at the Pelawatta branch of the Ministry and more information can be obtained on Telephone No.011-2513644.
There are 21 categories of information that cannot be revealed including private medical reports and national security matters. But, if some needs to obtain that kind of information, it is possible to go though Independent Information Commission. If thats insufficient, legal redress can be sought through the Supreme Court or Appeal Court. The public can request information verbally or in writing through a letter or email. Information officers will only register the names, addresses and telephone numbers of the persons who request information. When providing information, the first two pages of the reply will be offered free of charge and any subsequent page will cost Rs.2 per page.

SAITM issue: GMOA questions Ministers silence on SLMC recommendations
The Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) yesterday questioned as to why Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne was not making any statements about the recommendations forwarded by the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) with regard to the standards of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM).
GMOA Secretary Dr.Navin de Soyza said that Minister Senaratne should explain his stance on whether he is willing to accept the SLMC recommendations or not and questioned the Ministers silence on the matter.
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, Higher Education and Highways Minister Lakshman Kiriella and the secretary to the Higher Education Ministry are responsible for it.
They are taking a SAITM- biased stand and their irresponsible behavior will cause chaos with in the country,the GMOA Secretary added.
He further said that medical students cannot be allowed to practice as doctors without SLMC approval.
Dr.Soyza pointed out that when President Maithripala Sirisena was the Health Minister, he accepted the Five member committee report that clearly stated that SAITM had failed to meet the expected standards. Now, the Health Minister who took measures to complete the unfinished initiatives of the former Minister (present President) had failed to follow his steps with regard to the SAITM issue.
He said they would strongly fight against this matter and added that awareness programmes and discussions would be held with political leaders, state university students, parents and several unions during this week.
Dr.Soyza further said that Minister Senaratne had been informed in writing about the GMOAs stance regarding this matter.
When asked why the GMOA is not against John Kotelawela Medical College, Dr Soyza said the GMOA cannot oppose it as it has SLMC approval.
If the Health Minister has got issues with regard to the standards of KDU Medical College,he can directly get involved in that matter and find the truth, he said.

Sharapova boxes clever as return nears
MOSCOW - Maria Sharapova said she refused to feel sorry for herself during her doping ban, occupying her time by studying at Harvard, writing a book and even learning how to box.
The former world number one and five-time Grand Slam title winner told a Russian chat show that she particularly enjoyed lacing up a pair of boxing gloves as part of her fitness regime.
I tried boxing as I needed to keep myself in good form. It was great as I could imagine some particular people whom I wanted to hit, said the 29-year-old, without elaborating on the identity of her imagined targets.
Sharapova was banned from the sport after testing positive for meldonium at the 2016 Australian Open.
However, she will return to action at the Stuttgart claycourt tournament on April 26 after her initial two-year ban was cut to 15 months.
Her reappearance in the sport will come seven days after her 30th birthday.
I found out that Im very good in resting, added Sharapova when she was asked what lessons she had learned during her enforced absence from the tour and which has left her without a world ranking.
Formerly I couldnt imagine what to do during such a huge period of free time. I had almost 12 months to think, to read books etc.
She added: I also had a vacation in Croatia, I celebrated the New Year in Hawaii. Ive never been in London as a tourist before. Ive seen almost nothing there while playing at Wimbledon.
Sharapova, who studied at Harvard Business School to help expand her candy business, added she had written a book about her life.
I wrote a book which will be out in September. First it will be issued in English and then translated into Russian.
Earlier on Wednesday Sharapova said it was too early to discuss the possibility of her participation in 2020 Olympics at Tokyo.
Now Im focused on my comeback, the London Olympics silver medalist and 2008 Fed Cup winner told Russias TASS news agency, saying it was still unclear if she would play in Tokyo.
I would really love to play (in the Tokyo Games). It was hard to watch people competing at (Rio) Olympics, while I was unable to play there, she added. AFP

Six Nations champions England ready for France war
LONDON, Friday - It was once billed as Le Crunch but outspoken England coach Eddie Jones was ready for a rugby war against France in the opening match of his Grand Slam champions Six Nations title defence at Twickenham on Saturday.
England, on a 14-match unbeaten run -- 13 of those wins since Australian coach Jones was installed after their lacklustre first-round exit at the 2015 World Cup -- will be firm favourites.
But Jones insisted Les Bleus would prove as formidable opponents as any of the teams who've troubled England in their long history of rather more serious conflicts with France.
It's always a historic game, certainly there is history between France and England, said Jones.
We've got one staff member who is into history -- (defence coach) Paul Gustard.
There's been 20 wars between England and France. That's a lot of rivalry there. There is another one happening on Saturday, the Australian added.
We are going to face a side that's desperate for success. They are under pressure to play with French flair.
But Jones, coming right up to date, said an upset was possible if England followed the example of an Arsenal football side coached by French manager Arsene Wenger after their hopes of Premier League title glory suffered a setback with a surprise 2-1 midweek defeat by Watford.
If we do what Arsenal did on Tuesday when it was 2-0 and the team wakes up, if we do that against France, we will be in trouble because they can score some points.
Its really important that theyre in the game right from the start. We have to front up, do the business.
Jones has drafted utility back Elliot Daly in on the left wing while injuries have seen him reshape his pack.
Maro Itoje, best known as a lock, makes his first Test start in the back-row after blindside flanker and former England captain Chris Robshaw was ruled out of the entire Six Nations with a shoulder injury.
The boys got athletic ability, said Jones of Itoje. He's a great defender and thats what we want from 6 - a great defender. He fits that spot that Robshaw had.
Turning to Daly, whose last England appearance saw him sent off for a dangerous tackle against Argentina in November, Jones added: He has a big left-foot kick and he has genuine pace and can also play outside centre.
The way we want to attack France, that's going to be important for us.
With George Kruis, Itoje's lock partner at both Saracens and England, out with a knee problem, Courtney Lawes and Joe Launchbury will start in the second row.
England will also be without the injured Vunipola brothers, with prop Mako replaced by Joe Marler, who said drinking vast quantities of milk lay behind his recovery from a fractured leg.
France will be looking to go one better after running both world champions New Zealand and Australia close in November defeats.
Scrum-half Baptiste Serin has been given the chance by France coach Guy Noves to show what he can do from the start against England.
Serin was very effective off the bench in November after a very good tour of Argentina, said Noves.
It seemed wise to see what he could give in a difficult context from the start of the match.
An admiring Noves was wary of even an injury-hit England.
Like anyone else, we can only admire the continuity in their results, their mindset, he said.
But I hope we will show we can start doing the same, and that we will match up. We know their development system is so good that even with a few injuries, they have enough depth.
Someone knows the English game well is gifted France back-row Louis Picamoles, now with Premiership side Northampton, where he plays alongside England captain Dylan Hartley.
Its helped his career, coming to Northampton, said Jones of Picamoles, whom he labelled a lovely player.
He would be probably 15 percent fitter than Ive ever seen him.  AFP

Successful, stylish, goofy why the world loves Roger Federer
Is it his success or his sportsmanship His style or his smile His greatness or his goofiness
When Roger Federer plays tennis the world holds its breath. And there was a collective sigh of rapturous relief Sunday when the Swiss superstar defeated rival Rafael Nadal to win the Australian Open -- and an elusive 18th grand slam title.
Federer's stunning victory, after a six-month absence from the sport because of injury, prompted an outpouring of love on social media. His 6.6 million Twitter and 15 million Facebook followers were joined by sporting celebrities -- Formula One world champion Nico Rosberg, PGA Championship winner Rory McIlroy, Olympic legend Usain Bolt and Indian cricketer Sachin Tendulkar -- in congratulating the 18-time major winner.
Just like Bolt, Tendulkar and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo, Federer has transcended his sport. - CNN

UN Chief calls for lifting Trumps travel ban on Muslims
UN: President Donald Trump's order to bar travellers from seven Muslim-majority countries is not the best way to protect America from terrorists and can spread "anxiety and anger", UN chief Antonio Guterres has said and called for lifting the ban.
"In my opinion this is not the best way to protect the US or any other country in relation to the serious concerns that exist about possibilities of terrorist infiltration. I don't think this is the effective way to do so. These measures should be removed sooner rather than later," Guterres told reporters here, responding to questions on the travel and refugee ban imposed by the US. The UN Secretary-General emphasised that it is important not to have measures that "spread anxiety and anger" because then "we help trigger the kind of recruitment mechanisms that these (global terrorist) organisations are now doing everywhere in the world," he said.
Guterres cautioned that banning people and refugees from entering other nations will not ensure that terrorists will not infiltrate as the extremist groups could circumvent measures and look at other ways to target nations and their citizens.
The international community is dealing with "very sophisticated global terrorists originations", he said, adding that if terror groups want to attack any country they will not send people with passports from "hotspots of conflict".
"They might come with passports from the most developed, credible countries or use people that have been for decades present in the country itself," he said.
On the possibility that the Trump administration will cut US funding to the UN, Guterres said he will not comment on something that has not yet occurred.
"Sometimes we talk too much about things that have not happened and when we talk too much about things that have not happened, you trigger the happening of those things. I will not be making comments on possibilities to enhance those possibilities to possibly be a reality," he said.
Guterres stressed he will do "whatever" he can to prove the added value of the UN, to recognise the UN needs reforms and to believe that those reforms will be the best way to guarantee the support of all member states including US and its new administration. On the indefinite ban on Syrian refugees entering the US, Guterres said resettlement of refugees is in many situations the only possible solution.
"The US has always been in the forefront of refugee settlement and Syrians at the present moment have more dramatic needs in the world. I strongly hope that the US will be able to reassess its very solid refugee protection in resettlement and I hope Syrians will not be excluded in that process," he said.
Trump's controversial executive order, signed on Friday, halted the entire US refugee programme for 120 days, indefinitely banned Syrian refugees, and suspended all nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries -- Iran, Iraq, Libya, Sudan, Yemen, Syria and Somalia. - PTI

Unity flagship
Today is surely the best day to recall the words of Henry Ward Beecher.
A thoughtful mind when it sees a nation's flag, sees not the flag, but the nation itself. And whatever may be its symbols, its insignia, he reads chiefly in the flag, the government, the principles, the truths, the history that belongs to the nation that sets it forth.
As the national flag of Sri Lanka flutters with majestic grace in the soft breeze blown across the Indian ocean, representing our multicultural identity and our rich indigenous heritage on this, the 69th year since we gained independence from the British, it is with unlimited elation that we can raise our heads, gaze at our national flag and remind ourselves we are looking at a living piece of history and a source of pride and unity for all Sri Lankans. The lion, the orange and green stripes, the four bo leaves, all embody the very qualities that make our nation great. They are the symbols of justice, freedom, love of country and national pride that we as Sri Lankans pledge to honour.
Necessity of a National Flag
The story of our national flag dates back to the days before we gained independence. Toquote Nick Artimovich, an expert on vexillology as given in linkalibrary.com. The necessity of a National Flag was discussed even before Sri Lanka gained independence on February 4th, 1948. Mr. A. Sinnalebbe, MP for Batticaloa tabled a motion in the State Council on January 16th, 1948 suggesting that the Lion Flag of King Sri Wickrama Rajasinghe which was taken to Britain in 1815 should be the National Flag. This was debated and later Prime Minister Rt. Hon. D.S. Senanayake named an Advisory Committee for the formulation of a National Flag. The Members of the Committee were Mr. S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike (Chairman), Sir John Kotalawela, Mr. J.R. Jayewardene, Mr. T.B. Jayah, Dr. L.A. Rajapakse, Mr. G.G. Ponnambalam and Senator S. Nadesan, and Dr. Senarath Paranavithana (Secretary).
Although a Committee for the formulation of a national flag was appointed no finality had been reached when the first Independence Day was celebrated on February 4th, 1948. However, the Lion Flag fluttered on that day. The Lion Flag and the British Union Jack fluttered on the occasion of the opening of the first Parliament of independent Sri Lanka (then Ceylon) on February 11th, 1948. Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake unfurled the Lion Flag at the Octagon (Pattirippuwa) during the Independence celebrations held in Kandy on February 12, 1948.
Different versions
I have seen two different versions of the flag adopted in February 1948, continues Artimovich. One is a yellow lion holding a sword in the right hand facing the hoist on a dark red background with four yellow silhouettes of a Buddhist pagoda in four corners with a yellow border and a black thin border inside. The other was exactly the same without the black thin border.
Expanding this view, Carrol P Shaw writes in her book Flags, Originally, the flag's central emblem was a gold lion and sword on a red field, derived from the flag of the Sinhalese kingdom of Kandy. As a consequence, it was not popular with the minority groups in the country, and so was amended in 1951 to include a green and orange band, to represent the Muslim and Tamil communities respectively. Finally, when the country adopted the local name of Sri Lanka in 1972, the flag was modified once more, with four leaves of the pipal (bo) tree, a Buddhist symbol, added to the four corners of the dark red panel. This version of the flag was in official use from 1978.
Emblem of our freedom
Since then, this flag, which we honor today and will continue to honour for an uncountable number of independence days in the future, has been and will always be the emblem of our freedom, unity and purpose as a nation. It floats in majestic silence and yet, through this silence speaks to us, speaks to us of the past, of the men and women who went before us, and of the men and women who will precede us.
The flag of our nation has been through a great deal together with the people of our country and as long as it continues to flutter high above us in a cloudless blue sky there is hope of freedom and unity for Mother Lanka and all her children.
The significance of each symbol ofthe national flag is as follows:
* The lion in the flag represents the Sinhala race.
* The sword of the lion represents the sovereignty of the country.
* The noble eight fold path of Buddhism is signified by the lion's tail.
* Curly hair on the lion's head indicates religious observance, wisdom and meditation.
* The beard denotes purity of words.
* The handle of the sword highlights the elements of water, fire, air and earth.
* The nose indicates intelligence.
* The two front paws purport to purity in handling wealth.
* The vertical stripe of orange represent the minority Tamil race and the green vertical stripe the minority Muslim race.
* The four virtues of kindness: KINDNESS, FRIENDLINESS, HAPPINESS, EQUANIMITY are also represented in the flag.
* The border round the flag, which is yellow in color, represents other minor races.
* The bo-leaves at the four corners of the flag represent Buddhism and it's influence on the nation. They also stand for the four virtues - Kindness, Friendliness, Happiness and Equanimity.
* The maroon colored portion of the flag manifests the other minor religions.

Voges to lead PM XI against Sri Lanka
SYDNEY, Friday  Test batsman Adam Voges will lead the Prime Minister's XI in a Twenty20 game against Sri Lanka in Canberra later this month, Cricket Australia said Friday.
Voges is one of five players chosen with international experience along with George Bailey, Joe Burns, James Pattinson and Daniel Worrall.
It's really pleasing to have a good blend of established players with international experience and some of the country's brightest young talent representing the Prime Minister's XI for this year's match against Sri Lanka, National Talent Manager Greg Chappell said.
Adam Voges as captain will provide a wealth of experience, having played 20 Test matches and captained the Perth Scorchers to the recent Big Bash League title, as will George Bailey and Joe Burns, who have represented Australia in international cricket this season.
James Pattinson is working his way back from injury and he's a player of significant interest to the selection panel.
Daniel Worrall is also coming back from injury and this is a chance for him to step up his preparation for the back-end of the season.
Will Pucovski, who has recently made his Sheffield Shield debut for Victoria, is one of three teenagers named in the XI, alongside batsman Jason Sangha and spinner Arjun Nair. The PM XI will be coached by former Test captain Michael Clarke for the match at Manuka Oval on February 15. Prime Minister's XI - Adam Voges (capt), George Bailey, Joe Burns, Alex Carey, Arjun Nair, James Pattinson, Will Pucovski, Jason Sangha, D'Arcy Short, Henry Thornton, Daniel Worrall.

Welfare State Minister lodges complaint at Bribery Comm. against Divulapitiya DS
Social Empowerment and Welfare State Minister Ranjan Ramanayake has lodged a complaint with the Bribery Commission regarding the irregularities of the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat yesterday.
Speaking to the Daily News, the Sate Minister said that four tipper trucks owned by a Grama Niladhari under the Divulapitiya Divisional Secretariat had allegedly used them at the illegal soil excavation site in Divulapitiya. These Government employees engage in corruption when they were the ones who were responsible in tracing down irregularities and producing the offenders before law, Ramanayake added. He also said that he would be fighting against illegal soil mining and other environmentally harmful activities until they are stopped.

The wushu women of Kabul
KABUL: Sima Azimi frowns as she pirouettes in the snow, suspended for a moment against the sky on a hill overlooking Kabul and above the conservatism of contemporary Afghanistan.
There is still a need for boldness among young Afghans who wish to indulge in sport -- even more so with a martial art like wushu, popularised by stars such as Jackie Chan and Jet Li, which Azimi has taught for a year in the war-torn capital.
Earlier this week the 20-year-old woman left her club in western Kabul, sheltered from prying eyes by a discreet but heavy metal door, to train her young pupils in the open air.
In black or pink satin pyjamas, their hair covered, they practise the modern sport derived from traditional Chinese arts mastered by, among others, the flying monks of Shaolin in northern China.
Mixing boxing and blade control, sabres and daggers, wushu can be a choreographed exhibition of acrobatics or a full-contact sport, a challenge to gravity that requires bodies of steel and rubber. On the warm-up mat, faces sometimes twist under stress and pain as Azimi, a black belt, presses and pushes them.
Azimis family took refuge in Iran when she was two years old, with Afghanistan still under the Taliban regime. There the slender young woman was introduced to wushu.
When she returned one year ago she immediately opened her club in a stronghold of the ethnic Hazara community, of which she is a member, in Kabul.
Unfortunately, we have only Hazara students here and I dont like this, I am not comfortable with this solo ethnicity in my club, she tells AFP, adding she wants to welcome girls from other communities.
Hazaras, a long persecuted Shiite minority, are among the most open people in Afghanistan. Women are freer in their movements and more independent; men less oppressive to them.
As a result, they are typically found in the young teams of cyclists, climbers, and runners in the country who are often anxious to open the way for others.
My family never opposed my class here, my father was just concerned for me, he found me too small and he feared I could get in trouble, said Soraya Rezayi, 19, with the silhouette of a twig like her fellow pupils.
But thanks to my training I became more powerful, she adds. If someone came to harass me I could certainly defend myself.
I am the first lady in my family to do sport, says Latifa Safayi.
Aged just 15, she already sees a long way into the future: to overcome her parents reluctance to let her train, she proclaimed her dream of representing the country and ... raising the Afghan flag abroad.
I want to change the image of Afghanistan, too well known for war and drugs, she vows.
Now she trains three times a week, the aches which overcame her body in the beginning fading to a sport she describes as demanding and complete.
For their master Sima, the biggest obstacle was readjusting to her country of origin.
Iran is a developed country but here in Afghanistan there are some very conservative thoughts to fight, she says.
But it is only up to women to do something for themselves. So please, get out, show your capabilities, and dont let anyone choose for yourself.
It is not only on the training mats that the young woman knows how to fight.
But her demonstration this week at the top of the hill of Sharak Haji Nabi, although a traditional rendezvous of Hazara walkers, attracted too much attention in a country where many still believe women should be veiled and confined to the home.
She does not plan to return soon, she confesses.
