All MPs should join hands to assist flood victims
"Disaster-stricken people can be provided with succour only if all elected representatives join hands to come to their assistance.
It is because all parliamentarians were elected by the people to render some service to them," Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister and Mahaweli Development State Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said. The Minister was addressing a meeting held at Walasmulla last week to mark the distribution of relief items to the displaced in the area, Minister Amaraweera said that the disaster had passed now leaving a trail of destruction and that all should join hands to rebuild the lives of the affected and take steps to prevent such tragedies from happening in future.
He said the opposition cannot wash their hands off by arguing that the government should bear the brunt of the relief effort and take responsibility for the people's plight,
"No country was able to present national disasters however much it is technologically developed. The United States had to constantly brace up for national calamities - tornados, forest fires, cyclones and floods.
UK security forces could not prevent the Manchester and London terrorist attacks despite its sophisticated security apparatus," he said.
"As a government, they could provide material needs of the people quickly, but rebuilding their lives would take a little time, the Minister said.
"Although opponents accused that the government is unable to manage the disaster, it was the proper management of the government that brought everything under control very fast.
All ministers and parliamentarians visited the affected and looked into their needs. But certain quarters did nothing concrete to help the affected other than accusing and blaming the government.
He said the media should be thanked for performing its duty and responsibility properly during the disaster by keeping people informed about the development.

BoC recorded Rs.80 m profit from transactions with PTL
The Bank of Ceylon(BoC) has recorded a Rs.80 million profit from transactions that it had done with the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited between March 2014 until February 2015, it was revealed yesterday at the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue.
The transactions between the BOC and the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Limited (PTL) have mainly been on repurchase agreements and bond swaps. A repurchase agreement (repo) is a form of short-term borrowing for dealers in government securities. A bond swap consists of selling one debt instrument in order to use the proceeds to purchase another debt instrument.
The Commissioner Supreme Court Justice K.T. Chitrasiri questioned the former Chief Dealer of the Bank of Ceylon as to why the BOC brought all the transactions they had done with the PTL into a halt when the BOC has gained such a large profit as such.
"If the BOC has done nothing wrong when bidding on behalf of the PTL on 27 February 2015, why take such a decision," Justice Chitrasiri questioned.
Former BOC Chief Dealer J.D.K.Dharmapala said, the social agitation that revolved around the Treasury bond issue may have been the reason as to why the BOC discontinued all transactions with the PTL.
Asked as to who decided in this regard, Dharmapala said he received this piece of instruction in the verbal form from his Assistant General Manager.
Dharmapala said he was transferred to another department after the bond scam allegation.
Dharmapala further said the BOC has done transactions with the PTL to the tune of Rs.106 billion before the BOC halted its transactions with the PTL after questions were raised on the February 27,2015 Treasury Bond issuance.
Asked if the BOC is allowed to bid on behalf of Primary Dealers in the Treasury bond market, Dharmapala said, the BOC Operations Manual does not forbid doing so.
Justice Chitrasiri requested the witness to be confident and fearless to speak the truth before the Commission.
J.D.K.Dharmapala is to testify before the Commission today as well. Senior State Council Dr.Avanti Perera lead evidence for the day.

Lankan harbours could be major role players in OBOR
Sri Lankan harbours could play a major role in Chinas One Belt One Road initiative, said Wesley Yang, Head, Financial Markets, Standard Chartered Bank, China.
Sri Lanka has four fully functional ports, in Colombo, Hambantota, Galle and Trincomalee and two more are shaping up in East and North.
These would put Sri Lanka in a tremendous advantage for the One Belt One Road initiative.
The fact that Sri Lanka Ports are not too congested too is another advantage for the island, he said.
He also said that over the past 30 years it was China-Sri Lanka government to government transactions that took place and those too were mainly on infrastructure development.
These were for landmark projects such as airports, harbours, highway, bridges and other similar projects.
However since of late, there is a shift where private companies are investing in real estate and port-related development and in other areas, Yang said.
Speaking to media at a Standard Chartered Bank organised round table discussion with Sri Lanka, Hong Kong and Chinese media he said that they expect this trend to continue in the future as well in a more aggressive manner. Yang also said there has being lot of global focus on both the Asian and African regions and this too is expected to intensify. Intra-Asia trade too is growing.
Jim McCabe, CEO, Standard Chartered Bank, Sri Lanka, said that the proposed International Financial Centre (IFC) at the Colombo Port City too would be a major attraction for large Chinese and other large banks to have an anchor in the region. Their operations are not only to Sri Lanka but for the region.
He also said that in recent times there has being keen investor as well as tourism interest generated from China towards Sri Lanka. One of the key factors for this is the awareness of Chinese about Sri Lanka. As for the investors the FTAs Sri Lanka has with India and Pakistan and also the proposed FTA with China along with Ease of Doing Business rankings (which could be better) too attract Chinese investors.
Chinese companies can set up business in Sri Lanka and export to other countries in the region rather than having offices all over the region.
The Standard Chartered Bank too hosted a road show in Hong Kong and here too there was tremendous investor interest on Sri Lanka.
He said that with peace, establishment of rule of law, democracy and less corruption Sri Lankas situation is improving and this too helps investors to look at Sri Lanka in a more positive manner. Sri Lanka needs more FDI, he stressed.
He also said that Standard Chartered with its long presence in Sri Lanka and also its regional presence has a key role in disbursing of funds to both government as well as the private sector.
Today we have around 35% retail and 65 corporate customers.

5 things: I learned living with just a smartphone for two weeks
I recently returned from a 12-day vacation in Peru and, because I was going to be moving around a lot, I decided to brave the trip with just my iPhone 6 Plus. No laptop. No tablet. And only the lowest-level smartphone.
As it turned out, I did pretty well. Since this was a vacation, I wasnt planning on doing any real work, just monitoring email to make sure nothing important was blowing up back home, and passing along urgent (and semi-urgent) emails that couldnt wait for my return.
Along the way, I learned a few things that I wanted to pass along.
When you have only one device, make it a phablet
Ive written about phablets a lot, and spending a couple weeks living with a single device only reinforced my conviction that this is the ideal form factor for multiple use cases. It may not always be ideal, but my iPhone 6 Plus was small enough to take with me everywhere, and big enough to entertain me with videos and ebooks during downtime.
Power, not cell service, is the biggest limiting factor
When youre relying on a single device, the search for power can become all consuming. There are two reasons for this. First, if youre using only one device, that device will churn through battery life faster than if you were spreading your work among multiple devices. Second, if that device runs out of juice, youre completely shut down. Fortunately, phablets can carry bigger batteries than regular smartphones, so they often last longer between charges.
You dont really need cellular data to use maps
If you dont have cellular roaming, you can download the maps you need when you have Wi-Fi access and still use your device when you head out to navigate a new city. Just make sure you get the map info for everywhere youll be going before you lose your Wi-Fi connectionthat blue dot doesnt do much good on a blank gray background.
Data goes quickly
When youre doing everything on a single device, the data usage adds up pretty quickly. It makes sense to limit what apps can access cellular data, and keep data roaming turned off except when you really need it. If you dont stay on top of things, your phone can download a lot of data when youre not even trying.
Attachments are not your friend
While most modern smartphones do a good job with email, attachments can burn through data fast, and may not be formatted for easy viewing. There are plenty of apps designed to help with viewing and editing various formats, but working with attachments remains a hassle, and is sometimes a deal breaker. I found I left almost everything involving an attachment until I had access to a bigger device.

Medical experts say that anyone suffering from fever for more than two days should seek immediate medical treatment from a state hospital or a qualified doctor without applying home remedies. Only Paracetamol should be taken to control fever. All medications except Paracetamol cause fatal complications such as Dengue Haemorrhagic Fever (DHF), Dengue Shock Syndrome etc. Getting delayed to seek medical treatment can lead to complications and death.

Alternative lands to people living in danger prone areas: Thalatha
The government has taken steps to provide alternative lands to people who live in danger prone areas earmarked by the National Building Research Organisation (NBRO), said Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale.
Addressing a press conference held at UNP Headquarters, Sirikotha on Monday, Minister Athukorale said they were thankful to all and sundry who joined hands to provide relief to the disaster affected people expeditiously. This includes the President, Prime Minister, parliamentarians, all public servants including Grama Niladharis and private sector employees. The quick response shown by the Prime Minister who summoned a meeting by 9 a.m. on May 26 and issued necessary instructions helped to save many lives. A special thanks should also go to the Armed Forces, Police and Civil Security Department too, who helped in the rescue operations.
Athukorale said the President had ordered the authorities to offer unlimited stocks of provisions and relief goods to the disaster affected people.

Appointed Monetary Board member admits to oversight when signing February 23, 2015 Board Paper
The appointed member of the Monetary Board,M.Ramanathan said that it was an oversight on her part to have signed the Board Paper of the Monetary Board meeting held on February 23, 2015.
Ramanathan said so, while she was testifying before the Presidential Commission inquiring into the Treasury Bond issue yesterday.
Questions have been raised as to whether there was a solid decision made at this particular meeting regarding the issuance of 30 years bond.
"There was no concrete decision to issue 30 year bonds at the particular meeting,"Ramanathan said. Following her statement, Commissioner Supreme Court Justice P.S. Jayawardena asked the witness, if that was the case, as to why she signed the minutes of the Monetary Board meeting held on February 23,2015.
The Commission questioned her, if that was the case, why she signed the Board Paper without even making a note of concern regarding the matter. Ramanathan said it was an oversight from her part to have signed the Board Paper in question,and that she thought the officers of the Central Bank are responsible not to alter the minutes of the said Monetary Board meeting.
A disagreement occurred between Senior Solicitor General Dappula de Livera and Legal Counsel Harsha Fernando, when the latter drew the attention of Ramanathan towards a handwritten note taken down by the Monetary Board secretary H.A. Karunatilake at the meeting at matter.
De Livera said Fernando is confusing the witness by presenting only a portion of document, to which Fernando said, the other portion was already dealt with by the state council. Fernando alleged the Attorney General is selectively leading evidence. Mrs.Ramanathan was a attorney-at-law when I was just one year old.
So I am sure I am not confusing her with my questions. Fernando said, to the much amusement of those who were present at the proceeding.
However,the witness was requested to leave the Commission building until the two lawyers discuss and come to an agreement regarding the presented document.
When the witness was requested to return, Fernando took Ramanathan through the personal notes taken down by the secretary to the Monetary Board at that time, in comparison to the draft minutes the board secretary had prepared and the changes made to the same by Deputy Governor P. Samarasiri.
Fernando suggested that alterations have been made to draft minutes of the Monetary Board, prepared by board secretary Karunaratne, in many occasions by DG Samarasiri because they lacked proper wording.
Fernando read out a portion of a personal statement made by Ramanathan on the clear, meticulous and decisive minute keeping of DG Samarasiri, with which Ramanathan agreed to have said.

BBS Coordinator alleges assassination plot against Ven.Galagoda Aththe
Bodu Bala Sena(BBS) Chief Executive Officer and Coordinator Dilantha Withanage said yesterday that details of an assassination plot against BBS General Secretary Ven. Galagoda Aththe Gnanasara Thera by an outfit similar to that of the Islamic State or ISIS terrorist group have been revealed.
Addressing a media briefing in Colombo yesterday, he said the group has even carried out several dry runs for the alleged assassination of Ven. Thera.
We have already complained to the CID in this regard and an investigation has been launched.
Withanagesaid that the Ven.Thera has suggested that the Sinhala and Muslim communities should discuss and resolve their differences, but several journalists representing the Muslim extremists have distorted the Ven. Theras views.
Thereafter, certain Muslim politicians are allegdly engaging in spreading extremism have turned these media reports to their advantages. They also create a wrong picture against us in internality. Nobody wants to understand the gravity of the problem and solving it.But,they always allege the BBS for the actions taken to defend the Sinhala Buddhists, he said.
There is a big media campaign against the Ven.Thera. This campaign is run with the funds provided by the Muslim extremists who have already gained a foothold in every media institution.The assassination of the one Bhikku may not be a big thing, but who is going to take responsibility for the unrest that may follow, Withanage asaked.
There is some evidence about the activities of several outfits connected to the ISIS in Sri Lanka. Therefore, the government should take measures to provide security to Ven. Thera,the Bodu Bala Sena Chief Executive officer and Coordinator said.
There is no warranty against the Ven.Thera. It is only a statement that is to be obtained from him. Eventhough he had informed the Police that he would present himself to the Police on Monday, the Police had tried to arrest him on Saturday. There were many allegations aginst the Police and politians with regard to a number of assassinations and abductions that took place in the country in the past, he said.
A Minister who allegedly gets funds from Doha, Qatar for spreading Muslin extremism and Wahhabism is responsible for all these problems, Withanage said, while making many allegations with regard to the Wilpattu issue as well.
A report compiled during the Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratung Presidency in 2002 revealed how these Muslim extremists had vandalised and destroyed Buddhist place of worships and artifacts, he alleged.
But, nobody had taken action against those responsible for these alleged destructions. We urge both the President and Prime Minister to read this report and ascertain the scle of the destructions caused by Muslim extremists, Withanage added.
We are continuously receiving complaints from the Sinhala people about the alleged destructions of Buddhist temple and forcible acquiring of their lands by Muslims.We will set up a special center to receive such complaints and providing legal advise to them after studying the facts.
We will take legal action against journalists who have distorted our views. Not only the Sinhala Buddhists, but also Tamil people have been affected by the actions of Muslim extremists, Withanage alled. Therefore, We will join hands with the Sri Lanka Hindu Federation to face these problems. We invite all peaceful Muslims and Catholics to join hands with us in this endeavour, he added.
Sri Lanka Hindu Federation President N.Arunkaanth said that over 61 Hindu temples have been destroyed by the Muslim extremists in the East. It was the BBS members who supported us to erect a statue of the first Professor of Tamil Swami Vipulananda in the East despite the disturbances of the Muslim extremists in the Province. India will never allow its Hindu identity to be erased. So why are we allowing our Buddhist identity to be erased Arunkaanth queried.

Blooming lotus, wilted lives
Chinthaka selling flowers
They wake up early before the first rays of the dawn can warm the coldness of the night before. And as a thin layer of mist covers day break, so begins the promise of another day of work for the flower sellers. This is the story of the flower sellers of Galgamuwa, Mahagalkadawala and Senarathgama.
Their flowers do not bring them fortunes to make them kings, but it gives value to the tiredness in their eyes so that they can continue to face the hardships of life.
The flowers are plucked the day before and prepared into bunches of lotuses and lotus buds. They then carry their merchandise in buckets and head to the main Kurunegala-Anuradhapura road. They have no shops or tents to sell from and a small bucket does the job.
The heat of the sun nor the dust on the road can be helped, the flowers need to be sold. The team consists of around 15 flower sellers and they are spread out along the road, carrying out their business. They do not compete with each other as they know that they are all on the same road trying to make a living.
As they stretched out their hands filled with lotuses for vehicles from afar to see, they engaged in a bit
of conversation with us.
J. P Wijeratne
I have been selling flowers for the last 20 years. I am 64-year-old and earlier I used to travel around the country selling flowers, but now I am too old to do that. Now I have to rely on my son to help me do this business. We go to Sangalpale, Anamaduwa, Galgamuwa and Medawachchiya areas to get the flowers. For a day, I manage to sell flowers for about Rs. 500 to 800. But, we also spend quite a sum to pluck these flowers. Some have suggested that we take a lease out on a tank and do this business on a larger scale, but we dont have the financial strength to do that. If there are no flowers, after we have paid for the lease on the tank, all our money would have just been spent for nothing. So we are carrying on this way. When it is midday, I go into the shade of those trees along with the flowers.
At times we do deliver some flowers to order, but then we have to find a large number of flowers to do that and sometimes the profit from such orders is not much. But, we cannot give this up, this is the job we have been doing for a living, so we have to protect that. That is why I say that this job is not as beautiful as the lotus flowers we sell. God bless you for choosing to write about us.
Chinthaka Nuwan Balasooriya
I have been in this trade for the past 10 years, and for the past 10 years I have faced the general difficulties in life. In a way, it is the nature of this job. We need to survive either way. It is not only I, but it is thanks to this flower that my wife and three children live. I wake up very early and get on to the street carrying a bucket of flowers before the light hits the road.
On weekdays, I come here around 5am, but on weekends, I am on the road from around 3 to 4 am. On the weekends, many people go to Anuradhapura, so we hope to catch them early to sell some flowers. We pluck flowers worth around Rs. 1,000 to 1,500 per day, but it is not easy to sell all the flowers. And we have to wage a great war to protect our flowers from the rays of the sun. We need to have 2to 3 litres of water in hand to stop the flowers from drying up or wilting. That is how we can keep the flowers fresh until evening.
Not all vehicles stop near us and not every vehicle which does, buy some flowers. Some just ask us how much they are and others ask flowers for unfair prices. We too are put in a difficult spot at such times. When these people come in their luxury vehicles and bargain on the price of flowers, we feel quite disappointed in ourselves. They too should understand that we are in this business to make a living. By evening we sell the flowers at any rate as we cannot keep them for two or three days.
J. I. Nuwan
I have been selling flowers for the past five years and during this time, it is not only I, but all these sellers have earned some merit in doing so. We have sold many flowers to devotees who are on their way to worship the Buddha. So, in a way that is the only thing we can be happy about when doing this business, for this job is very difficult.
The flowers do not bloom in the tanks every day and while we engage in this trade when the flowers do bloom, we have to find alternative work when it doesnt. More often than not, we go to cut bricks or daily labour work. Also when the monsoons arrive, we dont engage in this sort of work. By now, the flowers in the tanks have started to decrease in number and by next month we will not have any flowers.
The struggle we have to undergo on this road from morning is indescribable. We need to wave our flowers in a way in which the vehicles can see them and so our hands can never be free. We start early morning and sell flowers until around 2pm, and then go back around 3 or 4pm to find flowers for the next day. That is how we spend our days. One bunch needs around 15 flowers and we sell a bunch for Rs 100. People cannot buy a bunch for this price in Anuradhapura, the flowers are more expensive there, but some vehicles ask for a bunch for a mere Rs 50. Our labour cost is hardly covered with that price. Sometimes, people pay us extra out of their own goodwill but we deal with a variety of people on a daily basis.
G.M. Heenbanda
I am now 52-years-old, I have been in this flower business for the past eight years. The past eight years has been a monotonous sort of life. The bunch of flowers I bring in the morning is prepared the night before. My wife and I get together and tie the flowers into bunches of about 60 or 70. We also go through a lot of trouble to get the flowers.
We cannot get them from the village tank every day, as the flowers are over in a day or two when we do that. So we also visit areas of Anuradhapura, Galgamuwa, Sangappalaya, Nikaweratiya and Kuliyapitiya to get the flowers we need. But, the flowers dont come free. We need at least Rs 500 to 1,000 at hand to pay those who own the tanks.
Even some of the Buddhist Temples give us flowers only when we pay them a certain amount. Having got permission, we enter the tanks with a branch in hand, these are tanks we are not familiar with and they may have dangers lurking in them. Especially crocodiles are a major risk. We keep God in mind and get into the tank.
Some tanks make you sink in, some have wells dug in them and there are times we fall into them. But we come back home safe and start work having once again prayed to God and having hung another branch.
Irangani
I have been in this job for the last two years now. I also have a small vegetable shop on the side to add to my income. My husband plucks the flowers for me. We make bunches out of them and sell it the next day. It is not easy to do this job with the child, but we cannot stop it due to that. Some people pay extra for the flowers at times. But at times, vehicles stop and ask two bunches for Rs. 100 and we are put in a difficult spot then.
We do not want to hurt their feelings because they are on their way to worship the Buddha, so I smile and walk away or I refuse their offer in a way which does not offend them.
There are not many such people fortunately. But, there are all sorts of people.
I also have some regular customers who purchase flowers only from me whenever they go to Anuradhapura, those bonds have been formed based on our goodwill over time and all of us have a few like that. On Poya days our sales are quite good, but on the other days, the income is not much.

Building the future: infrastructure in ASEAN and South Asia
ASEAN and South Asia are building infrastructure at an unprecedented rate. Anyone who travels the capital cities of this region knows it for a fact. Roads, railroads, bridges, ports and metros. All this construction is transforming the city centres and areas of economic activity and the lives of 2.4 billion people.
It is also connecting people and businesses to opportunities, both within and beyond the region.
But despite all the construction underway, ASEAN and South Asia have even more to build. The way these projects are scoped, structured, financed and supported will also need to change in order to meet their full economic potential.
At the World Economic Forum (WEF) on ASEAN in May, government and business leaders agreed that deeper public-private collaboration is needed to narrow the infrastructure gap.
To advance blended finance for sustainable infrastructure, WEF and the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) will form an ASEAN Hub using the public-private funding approach.
It will bring together governments, banks, pension funds, and philanthropic organisations to catalyse US$100 billion of projects.
This is a step in the right direction, but more needs to be done. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) estimates that developing Asia will require US$26 trillion in investment by 2030 to meet its infrastructure needs.
Securing this funding is crucial. Progress on infrastructure will mean the development of an economic hub. A unified production platform and marketplace will strengthen regional trade and investment activities, and drive trade with the rest of the world.
In our experience, there has been no shortage of capital for infrastructure projects. On the contrary, there is now unprecedented demand for well-structured initiatives with the right risk-reward balance.
In a sustained low yield environment, infrastructure projects are an asset class with attractive long-term returns. While the public-private partnership (PPP) scheme is a valuable solution for the lack of infrastructure budget, one other collaboration needs to be reinforced.
Banks role in financing long-term assets is evolving and will continue to evolve as IFRS 9, a major accounting change, comes in 2018.
But even through these changes, banks will play a key role in originating infrastructure assets. A close partnership between banks and investors is a necessary condition for infrastructure development success.
Banks experienced in project financing understand the challenges that institutional investors face when investing in infrastructure. There is a lack of in-depth knowledge and skills in project risk valuation and pricing among these investors, yet they are held accountable for their decision-making.
But when banks are engaged, projects will be structured and funded to a level where they become financeable for pension funds, sovereign wealth funds and philanthropic organisations.
Bank-investor-government collaboration as a three-way partnership is an even more robust and sustainable partnership.
A well-defined and fair model is one that provides an appropriate risk allocation and addresses the minimum expectations of investors. Infrastructure projects that meet these prerequisites will generate both economic returns and social benefits.
While the priority of the infrastructure agenda is focussed on the hardware of getting projects agreed upon, financed and implemented, the availability of the right software cannot be underestimated. And much of this software development needs to happen long before each infrastructure project breaks ground.
A key software is a stable policy environment, which is critical to ensure that decision-making is not fragmented and goal posts are not moved mid-project.
A transparent, predictable and independent regulatory regime underpinned by a sound legal framework will instil investor confidence. While these conditions can help minimise currency and commodity risks for international investors, early assessment and management is still vital to the success of each project. And to reduce risk perception of infrastructure projects, governments can rope in multilateral agencies to provide insurance or guarantees.
Skills are also essential software. The continuous provision of the necessary skills, either via the exchange of expertise and experience or through local upskilling, is important. Over time, the way infrastructure is getting constructed has changed. We need to build a labour force well-trained on new techniques and technologies to ensure we can build infrastructure in an efficient and environmentally-friendly manner.
More importantly, we need to develop a central and specialised pool of resources that can be deployed to cross-border projects of higher risks and complexity. Through the sharing of staff and exchange of expertise, the teams will quickly gain experience throughout the entire project lifecycle. Undoubtedly, the right skills and tools will better prepare the region for the evolving demands of an increasingly connected world.
ASEAN and South Asia are paving the way - literally and figuratively. Nothing short of political will and strong partnerships are required to deliver the full potential of this enormous wave of infrastructure investment.

## Title: Can Sangakkara emulate Dr CH Gunasekara

Can Sangakkara emulate Dr CH Gunasekara
Many Sri Lankans have over the years since 1919 when Dr CH Gunasekara became the first Sri Lankan to play for an English county have gone onto play county cricket in England, but no one has played in a champion county side other than Dr Gunasekara.
That rare honour - to be a member of the winning team Dr Gunasekara got while representing Middlesex in 1920 under the leadership of Sir Pelham Plum Warner. Dr Gunasekara represented Middlesex from 1919 to 1922 and was widely regarded as the best fielder in county cricket at the time.
Dr Gunasekara moved to England in order to study medicine at Cambridge University and excelled in sports missing out on a Blue due to the outbreak of the First World War. In 1919 he made his first-class debut for Middlesex and had a good all-round Championship season capturing 36 wickets at 27.72 and scoring 351 runs at 21.93. Against Essex at Leyton he scored 58 and took five wickets for 90 runs. Despite batting at nine, he top scored for Middlesex in the first innings of their match against Surrey at The Oval with 88 not out. His best performance with the ball came against Lancashire at Old Trafford where he dismissed their last five batsmen to finish with figures of 5/15. The following summer he was part of Middlesexs successful campaign for the 1920 County Championship and became the first Sri Lankan to gain a county cap. He didnt play at all in 1921 but returned in 1922 for one final season. In his three seasons for Middlesex Dr Gunasekara scored 644 runs (avg. 14.63) and captured 75 wickets.
It was Dr Gunasekaras fielding at cover point that evoked high praise. He was rated along with Patsy Hendren as the best fielder in England. Ronald Mason in his book Plum Warners Last Season (1920) wrote: Hendren in addition to being one of the fastest runners was the safest catcher in first class cricket and Gunasekara had a mercurial oriental brilliance which labeled him as among the outstanding fielders of the day.
Dr Gunasekara represented his country on 12 occasions 9 of them as captain and was the first Ceylonese to lead his country in an unofficial test. He was also a good tennis player and was the doubles and mixed doubles national champion on several occasions and represented his country against Davis Cup teams that passed through Colombo.
Nearly a century later (2017), Kumar Sangakkara stands on the threshold of emulating the great Dr Gunasekara. Sangakkara playing in his third and final season for Surrey has his county sitting in second place in the current English County Championship table, one point behind leaders Essex.
If Sangakkara can continue his extraordinary run of form he has displayed so far for the season after he completes his maiden stint as a cricket commentator for the ongoing ICC Champions Trophy, Surrey is bound to benefit a great deal from his broad bat. He is the seasons leading run getter with 876 runs (avg. 109.50) from 5 matches. With 9 more matches to go before the seasons end, Surrey could fancy their chances of landing the championship title for the first time since 2002.
In 2015 Sangakkaras first season with Surrey he helped them win the Division 2 title and gain promotion to Division I scoring 870 runs (avg. 45.78) from 11 matches. In 2016 Sangakkara enjoyed his best season with the county scoring over 1,000 runs (1039) at an average of 49.47 from 12 matches but Surrey could finish no better than fifth. The current season could see him better that figure and help his county win the championship title and equal the feat of Dr C.H. Gunasekara which has stood unchallenged for 97 years.
Like Dr Gunasekara, Sangakkara is also a former tennis player before he decided that cricket was going to be his future and, Sri Lanka cricket has greatly benefitted by that decision. By his achievements on the cricket field Sangakkara, a former captain of Sri Lanka is today widely regarded as one of the worlds most influential and greatest cricketers of all time and holds numerous batting records of his country across all formats.
In the ongoing season Sangakkara scored five consecutive centuries for Surrey narrowly missing out being in the company of Don Bradman, Charles Fry and Mike Procter who had scored six consecutive first-class hundreds. Going for a record equaling sixth hundred he was dismissed for 84 in the second innings in Surreys county game against Essex last week. Surely fate cannot deprive him of another achievement in one season. Lets hope his batting carries Surrey to a county championship triumph and make him only the second Sri Lankan to figure in a county championship winning team.

Celluloid thrill
Chandran Rutnam entered the field of Cinema in 1957 as a 'light boy' (Technician in the film crew) in the Hollywood movie Bridge on the River Kwai. The film was shot in some of the spectacular locations in Sri Lanka including Kithulgala. The film was directed by famous Hollywood director David Lean. Rutnam was involved in this as a 16-year old.
When the film shooting was over, Rutnam had a great opportunity to fly with the film crew to the United States of America. This golden opportunity allowed him to work in some of the top class studios in Hollywood including universal and paramount. He enhanced his knowledge of editing of films, directing and all other work related to cinematography while working in these studios. He spent nearly 40 years in the US. Afterwards, he decided to move to Sri Lanka and produce his own films.
He started his production house, Asian Film Location Services Ltd, which provided equipment and other services to foreign films shot in Sri Lanka such as Shadow of the Cobra, Fifty Fifty, Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Doom, Iron Triangle, The Adventures of Tennessee Buck, Mother Theresa, Road from the Elephant Pass and the Common Man.
Rutnams latest endeavour is co-producing a foreign movie at an immense budget, shot in Sri Lanka. Titled as Solar Eclipse, the Depth of Darkness the movie will be released in January 2018.

Q: Rutnam, what is so massive about the Solar Eclipse
A: Actually I am happy to say that I am engaged in this movie as one of the co-producers and also as the one and only service provider. This film was entirely shot in Sri Lanka. Also, this is a high budgeted movie. There are about five producers from different countries including the United State of America.
Creating the movie sets and finding ideal locations for this film was done by Asian Film Location Services Ltd under my supervision. The movie script was written based on a true story which contained some conspiracies which had taken place prior to assassinations of former US President Abraham Lincoln and another leader of the Indian freedom struggle Mahatma Gandhi.
I rather call this film as an Asian and American production. Although the entire film was shot in Sri Lanka, we could create all the American and Indian movie sets 100 percent perfectly. The staff members of the Asian Film Location Services offered a marvellous service while preparing these movie sets.
Q: Building up American sets in Sri Lanka is a daunting task. How did you overcome that hurdle
A: You must never forget how we created an entire city of Kolkata for Mother Theresa. We built all the necessary movie sets and other requirements for Indiana Jones and the Temple of the Doom as well. And then the movies such as Lord Mountbatten - The Last Viceroy, In the Name of God Poor and Water come in line. We have a professional team that works on producing these movie sets. They complete it to utmost satisfaction. I am thankful to Athula Sulthangoda and Bimal Dushmantha because they offer guidance to the team.
Q: How do you deal with the cast and other co-producers
A: I co-produced this with Panhage Shegall, Moobi Alright, Raja Ayyar and Nojen Boora, The cast includes Vinee Jones, Kris Henri Harris from the USA, Ome poori from India and etc. We have actors from England and Sri Lanka. The movie is directed by Dutch film director Karim Tradia and Pankaj Shegall.
I am assigned with checking whether the entire production goes smoothly to the satisfaction of other co-producers as well. This could just be a beginning of the golden era of Sri Lankan film Industry. We must not forget that the whole world will see the spectacular locations in Sri Lanka in this film and I must also be thankful for the tremendous support that I received from the new government as well as the National Film Corporation Chairman to make this project a success. I hope that this will be a trend for other foreign film producers to come to Sri Lanka to make their movies much more comfortably.
Q: The world cinema is now a part and parcel of digitisation. Where do you position Sri Lanka
A: The world cinema entered digitalisation 15 years ago. In 2007, I Joined venture with UFO Movies in India. We could import 24 Brand new digitalised film projectors. I invited the of theatre owners and showed them how to operate these new machines. We donated one projector to the National Film Cooperation as well. But unfortunately, the film advisors who were in the previous government made all plans a complete failure. They sabotaged it deliberately. Actually, they were running at their own personal agenda at that time.
They did not have any intention to enhance the film industry in Sri Lanka. I had to keep the projectors for more than two years without any use. Finally, we had to sell all those 24 film projectors at a very low rate to the government of Nepal to recover the costly expenses.
I must emphasise that the film advisors to the then president had taken brutal steps to destroy the project reports presented by us related to digitalisation.
Q: A new government is now in power. What could be your potential here
A: Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has appointed a committee for supervision of distributing films in Sri Lanka. The Media Minister and the National Film Corporation Chairman have been involved in accelerating the projects that we have already initiated earlier.
Besides, there is another project of building mini cinema halls across the island. We have already opened seven mini cinema theatres.

Terms that define social justice
Justice in terms of the distribution of wealth, opportunities, and privileges within a society is social justice.
Social justice is based on the concepts of human rights and equality and can be defined as the way in which human rights are manifested in everyday lives of people at every level of society.
Social justice is the fair and just relation between the individual and society.
Social justice is the fair and proper administration of laws conforming to the natural law that all persons irrespective of ethnic origin, gender, possessions, race, etc are to be treated equally without prejudice.
Social justice is the idea that all members of society deserve an equal footing in terms of opportunities, political rights, and distribution of wealth, privileges so that they can lead fulfilling lives and realize their potential in the community.
Social justice can also be defined as promoting a just society by challenging injustice and valuing diversity. It exists when all people share a common humanity and therefore have a right to equitable treatment, support for their human rights, and a fair allocation of resources.
We should have the courage to raise our voices against injustice. As Sri Lankans we must get up and see what are the injustices in our society. See the luxury lives of our leaders. See the standard of living of our poor people. Is there equal treatment Compare the difference.
Are we treating all people equally Are not there people enjoying unfair privileges
Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.
Fight every injustice.
If you are neutral in situations of injustice, you have chosen the side of the oppressor.
Keep calm and fight injustice.
You have the power to fight injustice.

Countrywide survey to identify disaster resilient regions
The Megapolis Ministry will launch a country-wide survey shortly to identify regions or areas that are safe for human
settlement for the reduction of vulnerability of people and communities from the threats of natural, technological and man-made disasters.
Megapolis and Western Province Development Minister Champika Ranawaka said his ministry is committed to promoting development patterns that allow safer living and disaster resilience.
He said steps will be taken to deliver a national level rehabilitation programme for those living in the countrys disaster prone districts in the near future.
Ranawaka said sustainable development will be integrated to restoration initiatives in physical resettlement.
I have apprised the members of the Cabinet and the President on the new reconstruction plans associated with the envisioned rehabilitation scheme, the minister said.
The government should focus on implementing a large-scale rehabilitation programme for recent disaster victims rather than becoming increasingly dependent on food and medicine aid from foreign countries, Ranawaka pointed out.
We have to look at how we can relocate people and communities from those disaster prone areas for their long term sustainability in terms of their economic and social well- being to reduce loss of life and property in a potential future disaster event, he said.
We have to ponder on it beyond the point of giving out a four or five perch land plots as some politicians have done, he said.
They only think about the elections ahead of them and they do not see the bigger picture, or think about the future of generations to come, he said.
We saw this was happening in Ratnapura, Bulathsihala, and Galle. The political circuses must stop. We must help them to stand on a strong economic sustainable footing.
If we can deliver a programme that can avert the negative impact caused on our economy by disasters, then we would have contributed to the uplift of the disaster affected, he added.

The Centre for Policy Alternatives (CPA) in a media statement has welcomed the government's decision to withdraw the Code of Criminal Procedure (Special Provisions) Act No. 2 of 2013 (Amendment) Bill.
The undertaking was given yesterday in the Supreme Court by counsel appearing for the Attorney Generals Department when the special determination was taken up to hear Petitions challenging the constitutionality of two provisions in the Bill, including a Petition filed by the CPA and its Executive Director (SC SD 7/2017).
The CPA argued that Sections 6A(2) and (6) of the Bills Clause 2 were inconsistent with Articles 3, 4 (d), 11, 12(1), 13(1), 13(2), 13(3), 14(1) and 17 of the Constitution.
The provisions, if enacted, will allow an Officer in Charge of a police station to deny lawyers access to detainees and the premises of the police station if such access would be prejudicial or shall affect the investigation being conducted. Because of this, these provisions are inconsistent with the rights of persons in custody guaranteed under the Constitution and the law.
The CPA argued that the right to a fair trial under the Constitution includes the right to a lawyer for anyone in custody. Sections 6A(2) and (6) of Clause 2 of the Bill are drafted in a way that is too broad with no objective criteria to determine the prejudice or effect a detainee's access to a lawyer or the lawyers access to a police station may have on an investigation being conducted. The CPA notes that while these provisions are proposed to operate only temporarily, similar temporary legislation such as the Prevention of Terrorism Act (PTA) became permanent over time.

As the drift turns swiftly
Newly appointed Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake, barely two weeks into his job, is getting a sort of baptism of fire with several countries in the Middle East cutting off all ties and physical connections with the tiny country of Qatar, citing what they call its support for extremism and terrorism.
Saudi Arabia, Egypt, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Yemen cut ties with Qatar on Monday, claiming the energy-rich monarchy is undermining stability in the region by supporting the Iran-aligned militant groups. Authorities gave Qataris living in and visiting their countries two weeks to leave. Later, Sri Lankas neighbour Maldives also joined them.
While one may immediately think of it as an internal problem of the Middle East, it does not much time for the ramifications to set in. More than 125,000 Sri Lankans are living in Qatar to the extent that almost every family in Sri Lanka knows someone who is in Qatar. Indeed, a total of nearly one million Sri Lankans live in Qatar and the countries that severed ties with Qatar, perhaps with the exception of Yemen.
From the point of view of a Sri Lankan Foreign Minister, the immediate concern would be about the welfare of our countrymen in Qatar. The sealing of the land border with Saudi Arabia would be a great obstacle for Qatar, which depends heavily on truck-borne goods and other supplies from the Kingdom. Once they stop, only sea and air connections will be available, but the latter will also be problematic as Qatar Airways now cannot fly to any of the countries that have severed ties. Moreover, Emirates, Flydubai and Etihad have also stopped flying to Doha with immediate effect and other airlines in the region are likely to follow suit. There has already been a run on the supermarkets in Doha and elsewhere, so food security is a real worry as Qatar has almost no local food production.
Qatari economy
If the ties remain severed for the foreseeable future (on the previous occasion when this happened, the ties were restored after about 14 months), there will be a huge impact on Qatars economy, even though Qatar is one of the richest countries in the world with a Per Capita GDP of around US$ 75,000. Petroleum and LNG are the cornerstones of the Qatari economy and account for more than 70% of total government revenue, more than 60% of GDP (US$ 167 billion in 2015), and roughly 85% of export earnings. Proved oil reserves of 15 billion barrels (588,000,000 m3) should ensure continued output at current levels for 23 years. On another note, it is scheduled to host the 2022 FIFA World Cup, a month-long international soccer tournament and the worlds most popular sports event.
But the problem is that Qatar is partly dependent on its Gulf neighbours for trade and transport and it will not be easy to realise any gains even from oil if the Saudi blockade continues. For the moment, some of the trade mechanisms are intact. Reports on Monday morning suggested that the Dolphin pipeline, through which Qatar sends gas to the UAE, is operating as normal. Qatar could also ramp up oil and gas exports to the rest of Asia, which would avoid the Middle East routes.
Even if there is no immediate impact, the Qatari economy could be hit hard, in the long run, affecting both local and expatriate workers including those from the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) countries. (Oil has already dropped below US$ 50 a barrel). The expatriates make up 88 percent of the 2.6 million population of Qatar. There could also be an adverse impact on remittances, since banks may not like to deal with the Qatari currency under the present circumstances. A forewarning of this came when banks at the Bandaranaike International Airport earlier decided not to deal in the Qatari currency, though this water later changed to an upper limit of US$ 1,000. This would have hit the expats who had returned from Qatar with Qatari funds.
Efforts are now said to be underway to de-escalate the tensions in the Middle East. Qatars foreign minister said on Tuesday Doha was ready for mediation efforts after the Arab worlds biggest powers severed ties with it, adding that Qatars ruler had delayed a speech in order to give Kuwait a chance to ease regional tensions. Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al-Thani spoke by telephone overnight with his counterpart in Kuwait, which maintains diplomatic ties with Qatar and decided to postpone a speech to the Qatari people as requested.
Sri Lanka should be watching these developments closely since any escalation of the tensions could affect our economy. Minister Karunanayake is no doubt aware that Sri Lanka has excellent ties with all the countries involved in this dispute and also some other countries such as Iran that have been mentioned in relation to it. This state of affairs should continue. It will also be interesting to see the impact on travel, though SriLankan Airlines has said there would be no curtailment of flights to Doha. A lot of Sri Lankans fly to Dubai via Doha and vice versa and this has essentially prevented that. Moreover, airline ticket prices have already gone up, since Doha is also a hub for travel to the US and Europe.
Another foreign issue that Minister Karunanayake must be watching keenly is the General Election in the UK which will be held tomorrow (June 8) despite a horrendous terrorist attack on the London Bridge and Borough Market. With the Conservatives slipping down the rankings, Labour has better prospects but it could very well go down to the wire. Regardless of who wins, Sri Lanka will expect to see a further improvement in the unique UK-Sri Lanka relationship that has stood the test of time. In the meantime, Karunanayake will be leaving for India this week for a series of bilateral meetings in his first overseas visit as Foreign Minister.
In an unrelated development, an agreement to provide an Indian credit line of US$ 318 million for the development of the railway sector was signed at the Ministry of Finance yesterday. Prime Minister of India Narendra Modi, in his first visit to Sri Lanka in March 2015 had declared a fresh Line of Credit (LOC) of US$ 318 million for the development of the railway sector in Sri Lanka. The Government of India has already provided four Lines of Credit for the development of railway sector in Sri Lanka through its EXIM Bank amounting to approximately US$ 966 million. These credit facilities have been used to improve the Southern and Northern railway lines and for the procurement of rolling stocks for the Sri Lanka Railways.
Cabinet reshuffle
Turning to domestic matters, there was a lot of speculation that some of the Ministers would retain certain institutions that were previously under heir purview before they were reassigned but now this looks increasingly unlikely. For example, the grapevine had it that Minister Ravi Karunanayake would retain the two lotteries boards and a few other institutions from his earlier (Finance) Ministry. There were reports that President Maithripala Sirisena was not in favour of this idea as it would create a bad precedent and also hinder work on the main new subject. It was intimated that he was not in favour giving institutions that were outside the scope of the assigned subject to any of the ministers. Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghes thinking is apparently no different on this issue.
The Gazette notification on the subjects and institutions of ministers is yet to be published and many ministers are still waiting in suspense to know what exactly is in store for them, institution-wise. No Cabinet reshuffle is ever going to please all the Ministers and they are bound to work within the confines of the gazette notification on their subjects and institutions. However, we have to wait until the Gazette comes out to find exactly who is in charge of which Government agency, also bearing in mind that the President and the Prime Minister also have some ministerial responsibilities.
The delay in allocating subjects and institutions has resulted in some unforeseen tangles within the establishment. The room problem between Ministers Lakshman Yapa Abeywardane and Kabir Hashim hit the headlines on Tuesday. This was not apparently down to any sort of personal animosity between the two men from the opposite sides of the political spectrum, but rather an issue concerning lack of room for the incoming State Minister Lakshman Yapa. It was reported that when he went to the offices of the Public Enterprises Development Ministry, most of the offices were still occupied by Minister Kabir Hashims staff. This has irked Yapa, who had left the place. However, a solution to this problem is likely to be found within days. But problems like this would remain until the subjects are gazetted.
Helping people in distress
The floods may have receded physically, but it is still reverberating in the political world. Deputy Minister Palitha Thevarapperuma has come in for praise on social media platforms and in the mainstream media for his honest intervention to help the flood victims. Many other politicians tried to follow the same path, but with some of them, it did not sound very honest because Thevarapperuma has a history of helping people in distress. According to one well-known anecdote, Thevarapperuma saw an accident happen on the highway and immediately set about transporting the injured to the nearest hospital. However, in order to accommodate the injured, Thevarapperuma had bundled his wife into the boot of the car had driven to the hospital at breakneck speed.
His wife suffered injuries as a result of this roller coaster ride and had to be treated at the same hospital. For Thevarapperuma, this was apparently all in a days work. There was another controversy when allegations surfaced on social media and gossip sites that some ministers and politicians were pasting their name on the flood relief packs given to the victims. This enraged many and the politicians mentioned were quick to stress that they had nothing to do with such a horrendous step. Minister Gayantha Karunatilake, against whom such accusations have been made, among others, said his political opponents were behind this move in order to tarnish his reputation among the constituents.
Many politicians also traded accusations on what caused the floods, with several of them citing the Southern Expressway as one cause. They have pointed out that the expressway runs through water retention and conservation areas, having not taken into account the concerns of environmentalists. However, many Opposition and Government politicians disputed this view, saying the expressway had nothing to do with the floods. Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka leads the former camp while Minister Vajira Abeywardane has defended the construction of the Southern Expressway. Minister Ranawaka took a few days off from his busy schedule due to the death of his beloved mother and politicians from all sides came to the residence to pay their last respects.
What is indisputable is that the floods have caused millions of dollars of damage to houses and other infrastructure from roads to schools. It will not be possible for Sri Lanka alone to foot this enormous reconstruction bill. Although many countries including India, China, Pakistan, the US, EU, Japan and Australia have already sent flood relief materials and funds to Sri Lanka, these would not suffice for the actual rehabilitation and reconstruction phase which should begin in due course.
Flood-hit areas
President Maithripala Sirisena has said that he will convene an international donor conference to coordinate assistance for rebuilding the nations flood-hit areas. He said that all international aid pledged so far would be used to rebuild the homes destroyed in the recent landslides and floods triggered by monsoon rains. The President toured several flood-hit areas and inquired into the needs of the victims. (There are around 21,000 families housed in 202 welfare centers with nearly 700,000 people affected).
There is a precedent for a donors meeting  the Sri Lanka donor conference held in Tokyo, Japan during the previous UNP Government (2001-2004) drew pledges of nearly US$ 4 billion from several donor countries for Sri Lankas development efforts. Although it might not be possible to raise such a large amount for reconstruction per se, foreign assistance on any scale will an enormous boon for Sri Lanka at this time when the economy is also facing other challenges ahead of Budget 2018, which is just five months away with a new Minister at the helm.
Minister Mangala Samaraweera has some good news in this regard.
The World Bank says economic reforms, International Monetary Fund programmes and resumption of European Unions Generalized System of Preferences Plus (GSP+) will help Sri Lankas economy to accelerate to 5.1 percent by 2019. Sri Lankas growth is expected to pick up to about 4.7 percent in 2017 and accelerate to 5.1 percent by 2019, as The IMF-supported programme helps improve macroeconomic resilience.
This compares favourably with the region - Excluding India, regional growth is anticipated to hold steady at 5.7 percent this year, rising to 5.8 percent in the next, with growth accelerating in Bhutan, Pakistan, and Sri Lanka, but easing in Bangladesh and Nepal. India is expected to accelerate to 7.2 percent in fiscal 2017 and 7.5 percent in the following fiscal year.
According to the World Banks June 2017 Global Economic Prospects, reforms initiated by the World Bank Development Policy Operation in 2016 are expected to reduce obstacles to private sector competitiveness in the medium-term and help attract Foreign Direct Investments (FDI), which Sri Lanka must strive to increase.

Matching the right skills and talent development for future market requirements, motivating students to build on their strategic leadership skills, develop confidence and interpersonal relationships, develop time management skills, Edulink International campus launches an exciting and innovative competition titled The EDU 360 Challenge.
Organised by Edulink International Campus with the clear intention of inspiring young school leavers in honing the skills of school leavers for the corporate world, the competition will involve group activities on strategy, entertainment activities and an after party.
Students will be testing limits and pushing boundaries to complete exciting races, scavenger hunts and a host of interesting challenges within a stipulated time period, with the ultimate winner carrying away a trip to Malaysia for two nights and three days.
The second and third prize winners will be awarded a holiday package in a five-star hotel and high tea at the Hotel Galadari.
Director Edulink International Campus Kanishka Weeramunda says, We wanted to take a deep dive into helping eliminate and minimise the soft skills gap that exists among students in terms of being prepared to face the corporate world. Students need to have strong communication and problem-solving skills, leadership and teamwork if they want to succeed in the workplace today.
It has been found that whilst many young students today are well qualified, these soft skills are greatly lacking. We believe that competitions of this nature will motivate students to learn these skills and understand their importance. Having these top soft skills on a resume could translate to placement in a much higher level job, resulting in a significantly higher pay for such students.
The event will be held June 24 from 9 am at the Colombo Racecourse Grounds.

England beat New Zealand to reach Champions Trophy semi-finals
CARDIFF June6, 2017: England booked their place in the semi-finals of the Champions Trophy with an 87-run win over New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday.
Victory meant England had won both their opening Group A games following their eight-wicket defeat of Bangladesh at the Oval last week.
New Zealand, set 311 for victory, were bowled out for 223 with 39 balls left in their innings.
Fast bowler Mark Wood took the key wicket of Blackcaps skipper Kane Williamson to dismiss the star batsman for 87.
Earlier Joe Roots 64 and Jos Buttlers quickfire 61 not out were the cornerstones of Englands 310 all out after they lost the toss, with New Zealand pacemen Corey Anderson and Adam Milne taking three wickets apiece. Victory meant England were through to the last four of a tournament featuring the worlds top eight one-day international teams regardless of the outcome of their last group match against arch-rivals Australia at Edgbaston on Saturday.
Jos Buttlers quickfire unbeaten 61 helped take England to a total of 310 all out in their Champions Trophy match against New Zealand in Cardiff on Tuesday. England, sent in to bat in overcast conditions by New Zealand captain Kane Williamson, were in danger of failing to get to 300, despite fifties from Joe Root (64) and Alex Hales (56).
New Zealand, who saw pacemen Corey Anderson (three for 55) and Adam Milne (three for 79) share six wickets, fought back well with the ball.

Export earnings increases, trade deficit widens
Reversing the declining trend observed during the last two months, earnings from exports increased by 9.8 per cent (year-on-year) in March 2017. However, the trade deficit widened in March 2017 compared to the corresponding month of 2016 as the increase in export earnings was offset by the higher increase in import expenditure.
Tourist earnings declined in March 2017, as in the previous month, with the partial closure of the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) for resurfacing of the runway. Meanwhile, workers remittances also recorded a decline in March 2017.
In the financial account, foreign inflows to the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) continued to record a net inflow while a reversal of trend in net outflows by foreign investors was observed in the government securities market with marginal net inflows during the month.
Financial account of the Balance of Payments (BOP) further improved in subsequent months, with the continuation of the above inflows, and also as a result of the receipt of the proceeds of the International Sovereign Bond and the syndicated loan to the government, thus helping to stabilise the external sector.
Earnings from exports passed the US dollars 1 billion mark in March 2017 for the first time since March 2015, amounting to US dollars 1,042 million and registering a growth of 9.8 per cent (year-on-year). This increase was mainly led by agricultural exports followed by industrial exports.
Earnings from agricultural exports grew for the fourth consecutive month, registering an increase of 28.3 per cent, to US dollars 257 million in March 2017. Improved export performance recorded in tea, seafood, and spices contributed largely to the growth in agricultural exports.
Earnings from seafood exports increased by 75.2 per cent, year-on-year, in March 2017 reflecting a substantial increase in seafood exports to the EU market, following the removal of the fisheries ban.
Earnings from industrial exports, which represent about 75 per cent of total exports, grew by 4.7 per cent, year-on-year, to US dollars 779 million in March 2017 led by higher earnings from textile and garment exports.
Despite the year-on-year decline recorded during the previous two months, export earnings from textiles and garments increased by 2.6 per cent to US dollars 453 million in March 2017, reflecting increased demand from the EU market.
Earnings from exports passed the US dollars 1 billion mark in March 2017 for the first time since March 2015, amounting to US dollars 1,042 million and registering a growth of 9.8 per cent (year-on-year). This increase was mainly led by agricultural exports followed by industrial exports.
Expenditure on imports increased by 19.4per cent(year-on-year) to US dollars 1,869million in March2017.This was the highest import growth (year-on-year) recorded during a month, since October 2014. The largest contribution (76.9 per cent) to the overall growth was from intermediate goods, followed by consumer goods (15.9 per cent) and investment goods (6.4 per cent).
Sri Lankas gross official reserves, as at end March 2017, amounted to US dollars 5.1 billion, equivalent to 3.1 months of imports, while total foreign assets amounted to US dollars 7.1 billion, equivalent to 4.2 months of imports.
The rupee recorded a modest depreciation of 1.8 per cent against the US dollar during the period from end 2016 to 5 June 2017. Furthermore, reflecting the cross currency movements, the rupee also depreciated against the euro by 8.1 per cent, the pound sterling by 6.2 per cent, the Japanese yen by 6.7 per cent, the Canadian dollar by 1.6 per cent, the Australian dollar by 4.6 per cent and the Indian rupee by 6.8 per cent during this period.

Flight attendant secrets that passengers dont even know about
A plane in the eyes of flight attendants and a plane in the eyes of passengers are two completely different worlds. And if the former know all its secrets, then the latter may have no idea about them.
Bright Side collected some tips from flight attendants on how to get the maximum comfort from any flight. Dont feel ashamed of asking for more food.
The food thats distributed onboard an aircraft has a short shelf life since its delivered premade. All excess containers with food are immediately discarded after the flight. Therefore, if your stomach demands more, dont be ashamed to ask a flight attendant for another serving. Check the presence of a life vest before taking off.
Its surprising, but its still a fact: there are passengers who steal life jackets from under their seats as a souvenir. Therefore, for safety reasons, check your seat before the flight to make sure the life vest is there and not stolen by a sentimental kleptomaniac. If you accidentally smoked, use the ashtrays.
You might have noticed that, in spite of the fact that smoking onboard is strictly prohibited, there are ashtrays in the toilets. People still smoke despite the fines. And its better they put cigarettes out in the ashtray than on paper in a trash can. So if you forget yourself for a moment and find yourself in the lavatory with a cigarette in your hand, be so kind as to use the ashtray. And then pay the fine. Try not to be squeamish during the flight.
Most airlines only do a "superficial cleanup" after the flight. Blankets and pillows arent washed, just beautifully refolded. Food trays arent washed. The seat trays are wiped, the carpets are cleaned, but you cannot be sure there wasnt a passenger at your seat who suddenly felt sick. Keep in mind: the lavatory door can be opened from the outside.
Flight attendants have their own keys in case a passenger is locked in the lavatory. In addition, many aircrafts have the door lock mechanism itself installed under the "No smoking" sign on the toilet door. If you raise the flap with the cigarette image and turn the bolt, the door will open. Be the last person to board.
If you checked in for a flight at a different time to your fellow traveler, theres a solution: just board last. When all the passengers take their seats, you can immediately see which seats are free. And the fact that the door has already been closed behind you and there will be no more passengers gives you the opportunity to occupy any empty seat onboard. Dont drink too much alcohol.
Flight attendants warn that one glass in the sky is equal to two on the ground. And this is true since altitude affects blood in such a way that alcohol during a flight affects you much more than on the ground. So even if you drink simply because youre afraid to fly, you risk becoming too relaxed. Avoid the bulkhead seats.
Remember this rule: if there are passengers with babies onboard, theyll most likely take the bulkhead seats. This is simply because its easier and safer to place a baby carrier there. So if you love cute screaming neighbors, you know which seat to choose. Drink only bottled water.
The problem of filthy water onboard aircrafts has gained a lot of attention since the scandalous study of the Wall Street Journal in 2002: the number of bacteria in water samples from 14 of the most popular airlines was hundreds of times higher than the established standard. Todays situation hasnt changed a lot, so its better to drink only bottled liquid onboard. Tea, coffee, and water from the sink should be avoided. Refrain from applause at the end of the flight.
In some countries, passengers give ardent applause to the pilot for landing the aircraft right on the airstrip. Perhaps people are trying to express gratitude to the crew or the joy of coming back home, but the crew may consider this gesture insulting. The flight is not a roulette game; this is their job.

Floating tales from Japan
The term ukiyo-e in the Japanese language is translated into English by Professor Howard Hibbett as floating world. Professor Hibbett has spent quite some time in many parts of Japan studying the myth, legends, sayings and paintings linked to the countrys folklore with reference to the era known as genroku. This covers the period of the late 17th and early 18th centuries.
As an interested reader, I had the chance of reading some Ukiyo-zoshi tales as rewritten into English by Professor Hibbett in his well-known work titled as The Floating World in Japanese Fiction published as far back as 1959 by the Oxford University Press. Hibbett states that the fiction of the floating world belonged to a prosperous, creative and illegitimate elite. It was the elite of shopkeepers and entertainers at the bottom of the Japanese feudal order.

The floating world was known by another term in English as caf society. The West has been accustomed to look at the world only in the ukiyo-e woodcuts and not in the Ukiyo-zoshi, its popular fiction. But according to Hibbett, the two are intimately linked. One is called the pictures of the floating world, whereas the other includes tales of the floating world. Two learning creative writers of the floating world are cited as Ejima Kiseki and Ihara Saikaku.
Professor Hibbett introduces the two writers and their works to the English reader. He selects source materials such as Characters of Worldly Young Women by Kiseki and The Woman Who Spent Her Life in Love by Saikaku.
Though regarded by the conventional critics of the later periods as quite trivial and commonplace, Hibbett observes innovation and creative spark in these tales.
For instance, A Wayward Wife has a typically abrupt ending. Kiseki offers a genroku variation on the traditional theme of the spoiled and restless wife. There is also a hint of her indulgent husband, depicted as an innocent human being. The wife had all the pleasures in her life. She led a luxurious life described as living in an incensed room, looked after by many maidservants. Her husband was handsome and urbane. Despite all this good fortune, she disliked being a woman. She was unhappy. One thought obsessed her: Why was I cursed with this sex I wish to enjoy myself as I please!
What happened next She sought her husbands consent to have her hair trimmed in masculine style and wished to dress in a short skirt which looked more like a boyish trouser. Her demands were endless. She wished to travel from one place to another; from one caf to another. One day, this couple went to a certain urban tea house.
Hoodwinked husband
Quite a number of episodes emerge. The wife behaves in the caf which, alarming enough, brings pains to the husband. But the husband keeps silent as he obeys her orders. But then he realises that the wife has to be allowed to behave in the manner she wants to prolong his life with her. As such, he allows her to do whatever she desires. But since the poor husband has a genius for being hoodwinked, he delights in her conduct saying how original it is to dress up like a man.
There are queer onlookers, who think that the woman has gone off her head. Disregarding the onlookers she even goes on to the extent of dancing and singing. She sings popular songs. The owners of the caf too are delighted at her behaviour. An uproarious party lapses into melancholy. Some guests reflect on the evil of squandering money, earned by the sweat of their parents. They feel inclined to go home without waiting for the meals already ordered.
The cafs professional jesters and musicians too become worried. Oblivious of the guests, they share their grievances with each other. Meanwhile, the husband who did not show the real inner sense of the conscience thinks it is fitting to behave as some others do contrary to his behaviour. As such he managed to exchange a few inappropriate household remarks with a courtesan. Followed by the consent shown by her, he pulls out some money from his pocket and momentarily hands over some extra coins to hold her hand and leaves the tea house at once.
Interesting narratives
Perhaps what happened later need not be hinted as the reader (or the listener to the tale) may understand the subtext. In this manner, Professor Hibbett has collected quite a number of tales. These tales, according to him, have later become long narratives. One of the popular sayings in the floating world according to Hibbett, goes as follows: A father slaves, his son idles and the grandson begs.
This proverb, scarcely witty, is indeed a wise one. It seems to anticipate the behaviour of modern children in the floating world, and its truth is still keenly felt. In one of the anecdotes of the floating world, titled as a swaggerer, a shopkeepers son follows the ways of the Samurai and gets into trouble. Publicly disowned for the security of the neighbourhood, he suffers misfortunes which are entirely his own fault, known by the term rust from the blade itself. Yet his disobedience is unexpectedly rewarded.
According to Hibbett, the two writers have been engaged in the task of keen listening and patient observation which is a sensitive lesson in the creative process.

Indian External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj today held talks Foreign Affairs Minister Ravi Karunanayake and discussed a number of key issues besides exploring ways to further ramp up bilateral ties.
 Earlier, Karunanayake called on Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi.
" Narendra Modi recalled his productive and memorable visit to Sri Lanka on occasion of the International Vesak Day last month.

Had a job interview but no callback Heres what to do next time
Be your true self, said Dan Cable, a professor of organizational behavior at the London Business School. You can promote trust by revealing vulnerabilities or discussing times when things did not got well. Know the workplace culture
Cable emphasized the importance of cultural congruence  sharing similar values and passions as the place you want to work.
Before an interview, if possible, contact people in your network to learn more about the company culture, said Blair Decembrele, a career expert at LinkedIn, the professional networking site. Be confident
You cant underestimate the art of the humble-brag, Ms. Decembrele said.
People find it difficult to talk about their professional successes. A survey sponsored by LinkedIn of more than 11,000 workers in 19 countries last year found that only 35 percent felt confident talking about their achievements.
John Malloy, president of the recruiting firm Sanford Rose Associates in Santee, S.C., said in an email that job candidates should be able to quickly and precisely answer questions about their accomplishments.
He wrote: The answer must be something like: I saved the company $300,000 during a three-week project. Our team created a new process that is now used throughout the corporation. Let me tell you how I did it.
Too many candidates will answer with a one-minute introduction and lose the interviewers attention, he wrote.
If you are stumped by a question, acknowledge it and tell the interviewer youd like to return to it later. Prepare to be on screen
Some companies, particularly start-ups, conduct first interviews via video-chat services like Skype. Preparing for them is crucial, April Masini, who writes about relationships and etiquette for her website Ask April, said in an email.
Practice in front of a mirror and choose a secure location to avoid having unexpected visitors, she wrote. (Remember the political science professor whose wife and two toddlers crashed his BBC interview)
And wear real pants, just in case theres a mirror behind you and you realize too late that the hiring people will see your waist-up-at-the-desk attire, as well as your waist-down sweatpants and bare feet that you thought were hidden, she added. Be inquisitive
Always ask questions but leave inquiries about vacation time, perks and benefits for a later time.
Some specific questions you can ask: Who was a good hire, and how did that person fit in What employee achievements are celebrated Where do you see the company in five years Develop a rapport
Job interviews, even when they are unsuccessful, can be a springboard to other opportunities.
Michelle Davies of Sweet Valley, Pa., who is an information technology engineer at a television station in Moosic, Pa., had started to look for a new job two years ago. In February she interviewed for a job at a television production company in Pittsburgh but did not get it.
Ms. Davies said an assistant in human resources called and said the managers liked her and encouraged her to apply for other jobs at the company. When she applied for a different job a month later, she was interviewed by phone.
She said she believed she established her credentials and built a rapport with the managers during the first interview and the phone interview was merely a formality. She starts her new job on Monday.
Dont be afraid to convince people about your value, she said.
What is it that youre trying to accomplish here she said. You have goals and you have to sell people on those goals. What to avoid

He who kindled our imagination
The passing away of this colossus literary figure made a sudden thud in my heart as I didnt expect such sad news such sooner. Yet, the demise of a nonagenarian doesnt arouse many a feeling in people in general, but in me. It was a shockwave to me for many a reason.
My real academic career began at Sri Rathnasara Maha Vidyalaya in Baddegama, a few kilometres away from the southern capital, the city of Galle. There, my Sinhala teacher was our famous dentist turned writer Gunadasa Amarasekaras eldest brother Edward Amarasekara. He is one of the finest teachers I have ever found to sharpen my literary enthusiasm. He left no stone unturned to kindle our imagination and unlock our potentials to serve the prodigy in the rising generation.
Critical essays
He always reminded us to read the free verse, novels, critical essays and many a writing by Siri Gunasinghe, Gunadasa Amarasekara, G B Senanayake, Madawala S Rathnayake, Mahagama Sekera et al. Siri Gunasinghes free verse style went very deep into my hearts core revolutionizing my affective domain, not in uncertain terms. At that time I just thought that what would happen when these literary giants leave us one day. It has happened to a great extent. How could a literary follower of this great veteran silence his pen Many an appreciation on his fruitful life would follow, but I quickened my pen to top the list.
Much water has flowed under the bridge since Mother Lanka gained independence in 1948. In the tapestry of Sinhala literature, Siri Gunasinghe was one of the most prominent pioneers who made a clear boundary between pre-colonial writing and post-colonial modern writing in tandem with the above mentioned all time veterans.
This great doyen of literary reawakening was born in the hill country. Panapitiya is a rural hamlet in Ruwanwella in the administrative district of Kegalle. The circumstances brought him to Kotagoda in Akmeemana in Galle where the Sinhala alphabet was initiated to him by his parents. He had his primary education at Kotagoda Sinhala School. His upcountry birth and the southern upbringing seem to have put him on a sound footing. Mahinda College in Galle was the Firestone that sharpened his literary prowess.
Oriental languages
He was able to secure a seat at the University of Peradeniya, then Ceylon University under Sir Ivor Jennings. He read for oriental languages there and with English literature. Subsequently, upon the successful completion of his studies, he was absorbed to the academic staff there in 1949. The department of Sanskrit gained a new lease of life under his stewardship and in 1951 he left the shores for his doctoral studies at the University College of London. He earned his doctorate from Sorbonne and returned with new vigour to serve his native land. He might have been driven by the well -known Sanskrit proverb, mother and the native land are more excellent than swarga.
Professor Siri Gunasinghe was an intellectual of high calibre. It was quite evident in his writing on numerous topics. Metaphors and similes came flying to him when he took his pen for writing free verse, in my view, it was his forte. This great writer deserves to be credited for having inspiration from the west in this regard and giving an indigenous fervour to cater to the literary needs of the amateur writers in particular and the connoisseur. He sowed the fertile field to reap the harvest later. Sri Lanka was able to reap a bountiful harvest in the subsequent years. He was a man of letters par excellence.
Sath Samudura, his maiden attempt in cinematography, took him to dizzy heights in filmdom. He could bag the film award of the year without any contender due to its artistic value that took the film industry to a new path. His pioneering efforts in the film industry paved the way for others to follow suit.
Unfurled genres
His only documentary film Ranwan Karal attracted the film lovers and left another footstep in the sands of time, indelibly. Almost all the genres he touched illuminated with his wisdom and genius. His wisdom unfurled when he took the pen to versify his thoughts. Among his versification, Abhinikmana stirred me to a great extent as I was passing my formative years of self-learning. Mas Le Nethi Eta and Rathu Kekula didnt play second fiddle to any literary work of that period. Sinhala fiction after gaining independence was detoured by Siri Gunasinghe to take the literary path of Sri Lanka to a new dimension.
The Sinhala novel was induced with ultra-active intelligence and imagination for the amateurs to find new paths for its advancement. That is the quintessential quality stemming from his Miringuwa Elleema, Hewanella and Mandarama. The Sinhala novel had just cut the umbilical cord at the western labour room when he brought succour for her rearing.
Siri Gunasinghe is not another name associated with Sinhala literary world; it is a name itself that stands tall and would live evergreen in our memory.
If my memory proves me correct, once he sat in the big chair of the professor of Buddhism in a reputed university of the United States. In his numerous writings here, it was quite palpable to me that he possessed a profound knowledge of Buddhist philosophy. In the evening of his life, he had domiciled in Canada where he has breathed his last. He died a nonagenarian.
The late maestro W D Amaradewa made his debut as a playback singer in his film Sath Samudura. Dear Sir, it is very poignant to imagine that you left us in a foreign clime. Yet, I withdraw some savings from my memory bank to pay a humble homage for your yeoman service to make us able to stand on our feet in the arena of literature.

I hide when I read
This is one of my flaws.
Its so interesting what the isolation of reading can require. There are those people who require silence for the plot to stick. There are those willing to sit in a busy coffee shop and soak up the environment and the characters of a novel at the same time. Theres no argument that our technical capabilities have opened up our willingness to read in between subway stops and email checks. But, I am regularly frustrated by my own hesitancy to read in public.
By all means this is a set back for me given that I write about reading so often. When I look back on why Im restrained, it might be because of unfortunate youthful experiencesthat time when somebody gave me hell for appreciating Nancy Drew in elementary school not because they knew Nancy Drew, but because I was caught reading a book. Good lord, kids can be cruel for no reason.
Or maybe its the whole rural childhood thing. Since I used to read in the field or on a hammock in the wind, its hard to let go of the sense of ease that comes from being in the middle of nowhere. That means that a crowd is never really that comfortable for me. This makes sense in some ways because Ill read on a beach with people passing by pretty easily.
As people have embraced reading in public with their devices in hand, the silent reading party has emerged. Early visions of public, silent reading parties came about years ago, with The New Yorker running with the joy of it. Forbes claims the trend began in 2010. Now, its so common, scholastic is recommending pajama reading parties for kids (Can adults please call them Pajama Jams too). And of course, Book Riot gave sweet recommendations for holding a party too.
And now, I truly wish I had gone to this party in April in Seattle where waiters brought drinks and musicians played in the background.
Swoon.
Except would I swoon with delight Or would I be nervous and watch the musicians do their thing instead Would distraction win What does it take for my brain to read in public
In the end, the question is never Where should you read The answer should be Anywhere!
The question is instead: How does self-consciousness in public keep you from meeting fellow readers, from connecting at a Silent Reading Party, or simply from embracing the fact that this isnt third grade anymore
The world reads. And so do I.

Armed men have opened fire at the Iranian parliament and the shrine of Ayatollah Khomeini in the capital, Tehran, Iranian media report.
At least one gunman fired shots inside parliament, wounding a guard, news agencies said. There are conflicting reports of other people hurt.
An attack at the mausoleum of Ayatollah Khomeini, the founder of the modern republic, has caused several injuries.
Fars news agency says three armed men raided the shrine in southern Tehran.
Two of the assailants shot at visitors, while the third "detonated himself in a suicide attack", the semi-official news agency said.
Iran's IRIB news agency quoted an MP as saying there were a number of attackers at the parliament building, armed with AK-47 rifles.
"There were three attackers armed with two Kalashnikov rifles and one colt pistol," MP Elyas Hazrati was quoted as saying.
The news agency said two security guards were injured.
The attack at the mausoleum, several kilometres to the south, happened at the same time and appeared to be co-ordinated, reports said.

It could be 10 times cheaper to take electric robo-taxis than to own a car by 2030
Ask a typical industry analyst how long it might take Americans to take most trips in electric cars, and they might say the middle of the centuryor later. The Energy Information Administration predicts that only about 3% of miles traveled in the U.S. in 2050 will happen in electric cars. But a new report suggests that it could happen in a little more than a decade.
Self-driving cars, the report predicts, will make ride hailing so cheap that the market will quickly transformand because electric cars can last longer with heavy use, it will make economic sense for those cars to be electric, as well. By 2030, 95% of passenger miles traveled in the U.S. could be happening in on-demand, autonomous electric cars owned by fleets rather than individuals. The average family could be saving $5,600 a year on transportation. Also, the oil industry could collapse.
The linear, incremental growth of electric vehicles predicted by some analysts might be wrong. This is not an energy transition, says James Arbib, a London-based venture investor who co-authored the Rethinking Transporation report with serial entrepreneur and author Tony Seba. This is a technology disruption. And technology disruptions happen in S-curves. They happen much more quickly.
Arbib and Seba saw that policymakers and others tend to make decisions without understanding how exponential change happens, and founded a new nonprofit, RethinkX, to study those disruptions. The transportation report is their first.
The report predicts that autonomous cars could be ready for widespread deploymentand have regulatory approvalby 2021. The exact year may vary, but the researchers have confidence it will happen between 2020 and 2025, based on announcements from car companies and how quickly self-driving pilots are growing. They also believe that regulators will want to support the technology.
There are enormous gains for the economy, gains on a social and environmental level, and so on, and we think that generally there will be a supportive attitude, says Arbib. Any technology that can save a number of lives as autonomous vehicles might dotheres sort of a moral imperative to try to introduce it when you can. From a regulatory perspective, we expect there to be a supportive framework.

Jayasenas cycling heroics to complete 570kms in 24 hours
A 63-year veteran cyclist and a former top level bank officer who is also a member of the board of directors of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation, Malwanna Guruge Jayasena will take up the challenge of cycling Sri Lanka's longest distance from Northern Point Pedro to Southern Dondra Point within 24 hours. A resident of Hikkaduwa, Jayasena will start this record breaking tour on June 10 early morning 1.30 from Point Pedro and will pass Kilinochchi, Vavuniya, Anuradhapura to reach Chilaw.
He will take a six-hour break at Chilaw and will start the final phase on June 11 early morning 1.00 from Chilaw to Dondra through Colombo, Kalutara, Ambalangoda, Hikkaduwa, Galle and Matara completing nearly 570kms. The tour is organized by the Ambalangoda Cycle Association under the purview of Sports Ministry and Cycling Federation of Sri Lanka officials. It will be the first time in Sri Lanka a sexagenarian dare to take up the challenge of riding his foot-bike from North most to South most tips of the island within such a short time (24hours).
Jayasena's main concern is not to set up a record. There will be a great chance for him to enter record books, if he succeed in completing 570kms on his foot-bike in 24 hours, but he would like to spread the message of healthy lifestyle that the foot-bike bestow on masses. Popularising cycling as a sport, a day-to-day activity and a method of transportation at all age groups and every level of the society will be paramount in Jayasena's effort. He also believes his attempt will be an inspiration to many elderly people who are very distant from sports activities and will give them the message that the mental strength matters more than physical abilities.
Jayasena is a constant long distance cyclist who has a habit of celebrating his birthdays with a cycle tour.
He last completed a three-day cycle tour from Hikkaduwa to Polonnaruwa via Anuradhapura and back to Hikkaduwa covering nearly 800kms as a celebration tour of his 62nd birthday on 20/2/2016.
In the month of June of the same year he completed a 600km, three-day tour starting from Hikkaduwa, covering the hilly terrain of Dambulla and Kandy to return on the same rout to Hikkaduwa. Jayasena' s habitual birthday cycle tours for his 60th and 61st birthdays have been two-day tours from Hikkaduwa to Kataragama with approximate distance of 400kms each.

Jetwing Hotels promotes green tourism using biomass energy
In Sri Lanka, the hospitality industry is one of the most fuel-dependent industries, especially for the running of hotels. One of the first hotel chains to use commercially available and modern biomass technology to generate heat and steam is the Jetwing Group, said its Chairman Hiran Cooray.
The use of biomass fuel for energy generation by Jetwing Hotels goes back to 2008 with the installation of a biomass gasifier at Hunas Falls Hotel (back then managed by Jetwing), he said.
Since then the use of biomass has become quite a standard practice in our hotels wherever possible. The first biomass boiler was installed at Jetwing Blue in 2008 and with its success and financial savings of using biomass over diesel fuel, the technology of biomass boilers was replicated at Jetwing Sea, Jetwing Lighthouse, Jetwing Beach and Jetwing St. Andrew's. All of them were utilised to generate hot water for guest rooms and steam for the hotels laundry, if available, he said.
Later on, steam-driven absorption chillers were introduced instead of electricity-driven conventional chillers. These chillers are powered entirely by steam produced from the biomass boiler. At Jetwing Lagoon, Negombo, electricity consumption of the hotel was reduced by around 50-60% using this terchnology.
Similar systems were installed at Jetwing Yala, Jetwing Lake and most recently a steam-driven absorption chiller was commissioned at Jetwing Blue.
One of the key components of Jetwing Hotels sustainability strategy is to manage and reduce energy and carbon footprint. The transition to biomass energy aids in both avoiding emissions from equivalent non-renewable energy sources (diesel or grid electricity) and reducing associated operational costs.
First and foremost in terms of financial savings we could obtain approximately 40-50% saving from the biomass boiler and 20% saving on boiler plus absorption chiller installations, Cooray said.
Cinnamon wood, the only fuelwood (biomass) type used at Jetwing Hotels, is considered as a sustainable source of fuelwood, due to its short cropping cycle when compared to other more widely available fuelwood such as rubber and off cuts. Cinnamon is a virtually carbon neutral source of energy and the transition to biomass energy has resulted in avoiding over 2,000 MT CO2 emissions (per annum) from across the hotels.
Cinnamon is not grown as a fuelwood but rather for the production of cinnamon spice and the wood itself is considered a waste or byproduct of the industry. In creating and maintaining a stable supply chain for the purchase of this waste product, we have managed to provide the cinnamon farmers with an additional income - passing on part of benefits of our savings to the villager, he said.
Cooray said the mitigation of carbon emissions is quantifiable - the estimated carbon emissions avoided per annum is over 2,000 MT.
The hotels source cinnamon wood from about 30 suppliers who collect the product from different villagers in the region.
He said in this way the communities involved around this project are also benefitted, not just to the farmers but also the local supply chain comprising collectors and distributors.
Cooray said the Ministry of Environment and Sri Lanka Sustainable Energy Authority is in the process of implementing a GEF (Global Environmental Facility) funded project to promote Sustainable Biomass Energy Production and Modern Bio Energy Technologies in Sri Lanka. Jetwing Hotels and other private stakeholders have been invited to participate in project discussions and forums.
The project aims to streamline the island's biomass supply chains, establishing good links between the suppliers and buyers and also to develop centralised biomass collection and storage areas in strategic locations.
We believe such initiatives would give us the benefit of having a reliable supply of biomass and also help the producers obtain competitive rates for their product, Cooray said.

Kent snap up Pakistan spin ace
LONDON: Ace Pakistan leg-spinner Yasir Shah will weave his magic for Kent in four second tier championship matches, the county announced on Monday.
The 31-year-old -- who has taken 149 wickets at an average of 29.91 in 26 Test matches -- is to stand in for Kents foreign player signing New Zealand paceman Adam Milne, who is away on Champions Trophy duty.
Yasir is one of the finest spinners in the world, Kent head coach Matt Walker said.
Taking 20 wickets consistently in red-ball cricket (county championship) will be key to our promotion chances and a bowler of Yasirs calibre will help to us achieve that and rotate our attack at a key period in the season.
Yasir could make his debut in the game with Durham beginning on Thursday.
Kent are currently second in the Division Two table, having won four of their opening five games of the season. - AFP

Korea to provide US$ 200 million for Kandy tunnel
The Korean Strategy and Finance Ministry approved US$ 200 million for the Kandy tunnel construction project comprising four tunnels with a total length of 5.5km.
The tunnel is to run from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura via Bogambara and Ampitiya which will be the longest tunnel in Sri Lanka.
Korea Eximbank will finance this project with a concessional EDCF loan of 0.15 percent interest rate and 40-year repayment period including a 10 year grace period.
The project executing agency will be the Highways and Higher Education Ministry of Sri Lanka whereas the project implementing unit will be the Road Development Authority (RDA).
The objective of the project is to ease the traffic congestion in the Kandy centre by constructing by-pass tunnels for vehicles heading to the West or the East of Kandy without entering Kandy Lake Road.
After establishing the tunnel, it is expected to reduce the passing time from Suduhumpola to Tennekumbura from 2 hours to less than 30 minutes during rush hours. The Kandy tunnel is expected to save money due to the extra fuel combustion and reduce air pollution near Sri Dalada Maligawa (Temple of the Sacred Tooth Relic).
In addition, the tunnel will boost the economy of Kandy by providing a short connection between the Kandy industrial zone and the road (A1) to Colombo where container terminals for export are located.
The Korean governments decision to finance US$ 200 million for this project comes at a significant time as when Sri Lanka and Korea mark the 40th anniversary of diplomatic relations this year.
Korea Eximbank provided its first ODA loan for the rehabilitation of the Colombo-Galle road (A2) in 1990. As of now, the Bank has approved US$ 805 million for 28 development projects in Sri Lanka.
Korea Eximbank also provides financing for international trade and overseas investment, to promote bilateral economic cooperation. Since 1978, Korea Eximbank has provided US$ 386 million both for trade between Sri Lanka and Korea and for Korean companies foreign direct investments in Sri Lanka.

As the diplomatic crisis in Qatar continues, Sri Lankan authorities assure that all dealings between Sri Lanka and Qatar will proceed as normal. On Monday Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, UAE and Egypt to cut off diplomatic ties with Qatar, accusing its fellow Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) member of undermining security in the region by siding with Iran and claiming that it supported the Islamic Brotherhood and Iranian-backed terrorist groups. Amidst chaos in the Gulf, confusion reigned at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) yesterday as false reports surfaced that banks at the BIA had stopped exchanging Qatari Riyals. When Daily News contacted representatives from the BIA branches of Bank of Ceylon, Peoples Bank, and Commercial Bank, they confirmed that the banks were still exchanging Riyals. The BIA Duty Manager claimed that the Central Bank (CB) had informed banks not to accept Riyals, but the CB released a statement categorically denying that it had informed banks not to exchange Riyals.
A representative from the airports Sampath Bank branch refused to give any information on the matter over the phone.
Some private money changers, however, have not been buying Riyals for the past three days.
Sri Lankan Airlines in the meantime assured that they would continue to operate its flights to Doha, Qatar as per schedule despite the diplomatic tensions in the Middle East.
Sri Lankan Airlines said they were closely monitoring the situation in the region and added that the regional tension has not affected them. Sri Lankan Airline flights to Doha which operate on a daily basis will function as usual.
Etihad Airways and Emirates however suspended all flights to and from Qatar yesterday, as UAE airspace and territorial waters are closed off for Qatari vessels and aircraft. Foreign media also reported that Qatar Airways had in turn suspended all flights to Saudi Arabia, UAE, Bahrain and Egypt until further notice.
Sources indicate that Sri Lankan Airlines could benefit from the termination of flights from the United Arab Emirates to Qatar, as customers flying between Sri Lanka and the two countries might take their business to the airline. Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale reassured that Sri Lankans in Qatar will not have any issues due to the diplomatic tensions in the Middle East.
It is an issue between the regional countries. The decision has not caused any problem for Sri Lankans living there, she said.
Minister Athukorale said there were no problems so far in the diplomatic circle as well.
She requested migrant workers to inform the embassy there if they had any plans to return to Sri Lanka. We will take initiatives to bring them back to the country, if there are any issues, she said.At present 140,000 Sri Lankans live and work in Qatar apart from another 1.5 million foreign nationals working there.
All countries have responsibility over their citizens working in Qatar. Therefore, the government will take appropriate measures when needed, she said. If you need to know any information please contact the Sri Lankan Embassy in Qatar without believing in fake news, she said.

Lanka will support UN achieve SDGs - PM
Sri Lanka will offer its unstinted support towards plans drawn up by the Food and Agriculture Organisation to combat illegal and unregulated fishing activities Prime Minster Ranil Wickremsinghe said.
Sri Lanka will also support UN in achieving Global Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as well.
He said President Maithripala Sirisena has already signed the Paris Accord on climate change, in his address to the UN Ocean Conference held in New York USA on June 5.
Prime Minister Wickremsinghe who described the ocean conference as another step in a historic process added that their endeavour was to understand and neutralise the adverse influence caused to mother earth by human civilization.
He recounted that this process began with the UN conference on human environment held at Stockholm in 1972. Since then they had talked much on the responsibility of environmental protection cast on all nations.
Wickremesinghe said his government believed that one aspect should come into special focus at this conference. That aspect was provision of financial resources.
The successful implementation of steps they agree on conservation depended only on the uninterrupted supply of financial resources. The Prime Minister said We should make a collective effort to build a sustainable ocean economy. It includes features such as aquaculture, obtaining renewable energy from the ocean, improvement of ocean technology as well as eliminating ocean pollution.
The financial contributions received from Governments and donors towards this would be inadequate. Therefore they should find private sector parties and other methods of financial resources towards it. Similarly they ought to find new parties and new co-operation for this massive task.
Island nations like Sri Lanka faced the direct impact of climate change and changes in the natural ocean environment. Sri Lanka had faced several natural disasters during the past decade. The 2004 Tsunami, floods, landslides and other types of disasters were among them. At this very moment hundreds of Sri Lankans have died and several lakhs of people have been displaced by heavy torrential rain and floods. Sri Lanka was extremely thankful for the relief aid received from the members of the international world and community. But one factor was evident from this. That was our inability to face such catastrophies, the Prime Minister said.
Countries like ours may face life and death at the hands of the ocean. The Indian ocean provides us with food, livelihood, trade opportunities and other facilities. A major part of our population lived in maritime areas. But problems such as the rise in sea level, ocean pollutions and depreciation of fish resources directly impacted on us.
The latest funding is the second largest floating amount of plastic waste is found in the Indian Ocean. Minimising ocean pollution and sustainable use of ocean resources were the biggest challenges facing us in the future. The Prime Minister said: Our future depended on both our own and your contribution. On account of these global links we as a nation always willingly join international attempts towards environmental conservation.

MR at it again
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa has done it again. Making use of a visit to Japan, Rajapaksa has sought to extend his partisan politics even on alien soil by being critical of the government while in a foreign land. According to an English daily, Rajapaksa says that Sri Lankans living in Japan were critical of the Yahapalanaya government and was clamouring for a regime change. How a regime change in Sri Lanka can transform the lives of Sri Lankans in Japan, who, no doubt, are living comfortable lives in that country no one has ventured out to say. He (MR) has also stated that Lankan businessmen in Japan, particularly vehicle importers, were complaining that they were no longer able to survive due to the disastrous policies of the Yahapalanaya government (no businessman though were quoted in the article). One would have thought that Sri Lankan businessmen in Japan hardly relied on Sri Lankan government policies to prosper as businessmen in Japan and particularly were dependent on Sri Lanka for their vehicle exports. Or are they cross because the import of Lambroginis have ceased under the Yahapalanaya government
Sri Lankans living in Japan and who want a regime change could not have all migrated to that country after January 8. A majority of the countrys workforce always seek greener pastures looking for the proverbial pot of gold and Japan holds out very lucrative prospects even over most of the Western countries. Hence the exodus cannot be of recent origin and it is very much doubtful if the economic policies of the Yahapalanaya government drove these Lankans to Japan. It would have been relevant if these Sri Lankans living in Japan were asked if things were all hunky dory during the tenure of Rajapaksa and if so what drove them to Japan, for there can be no doubt that mass migration of Sri Lankans to Japan and other countries for brighter prospects has been a continuing phenomenon since the doors were opened to the foreign job market in the late seventies.
We have only Rajapaksas word that Lankans living in Japan are yearning for a regime change and in the absence of any tangible evidence to confirm this, one has to come to the conclusion that it is a only a concoction of Rajapaksa for local consumption. True, there may have been some elements who had been mobilised by MRs handlers in Japan to welcome him and indeed make uncomplimentary remarks about the government. But these hardly constitute the general opinion of the Sri Lankans living in Japan.
Which bring us to the question of protocol. This is not the first time that MR had painted the government in poor light while in a foreign land. There was once an instance where MR delivered a strong broadside at the government after travelling abroad at state expense. It is not clear if the current visit to Japan, undertaken by Rajapaksa, with a fourteen member delegation, including his son Yoshitha, and an In-law to be, too had been funded by the government or it was purely a private visit. Whatever it is, it is certainly unbecoming of a former Head of State, who is being maintained and provided for by the government, to speak ill of it while in a foreign land as Rajapaksa has been continued to do during all his visits abroad.
True, Rajapaksa is a member of parliament representing the Opposition and has to play the role of an Opposition member (though it is moot if this role can be taken beyond our shores). However over and above that of an Opposition member of parliament he is first and foremost regarded and accepted as the former Head of State. That is why he still has audiences with visiting dignitaries and Heads of State as seen in the recent meeting with Indian Prime Minister Modi. Hence it is expected of him to maintain this dignity and decorum as the former Head of State of this country. Former President J.R. Jayewardene was the epitome of this quality attributable to a retired a Head of State who had gone into the sunset. JRJ confined himself to formal after dinner speeches and being occasional chief guest at selected events. President D.B. Wijetunga retired from public life altogether after his exit while CBK too, although, still very much in the public eye, following retirement, did not thrust herself to make a political comeback.
In that context Mahinda Rajapaksa is the only retired Head of State who is still engaged in active politics although he has no prospects of being President again and only a very remote possibility of becoming Prime Minister. For all that, MR continues to be on the war path, politically speaking, which cannot be found fault with, except when he goes beyond the ken and demeans himself and the high office he once held in his quest for power.

Muslim Council of Sri Lanka condemns London attacks
The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka in a statement yesterday condemned the London terror attacks, carried out in the name of Islam.
The organization in a statement issued under the hand of its president N.M.Ameen stressed that the ISIS is not Islamic and does not represent the Muslims or the message and spirit of Islam.
The message: The Muslim Council of Sri Lanka vehemently condemns the three cowardly acts of terror supposedly carried out in the name of Islam on innocent civilians.
ISIS is not Islamic and doesnt represent Muslims or the message and spirit of Islam. Islam forbids attacks on innocents, even in battle. ISIS continues to cause terror across the world to provoke a backlash against peaceful Muslims, which would encourage youth to take up terror as a means of revenge.
We call upon the Muslims of the world to pray for the speedy recovery of the innocent victims who were injured, and who lost their lives. We also extend our heartfelt condolences and pray for the families of the people affected by this horrendous crime.

Nestls new milk chilling centre to benefit Seeppukulama farmers
Milk farmers in the North-Central village of Seeppukulama will benefit from a milk chilling centre upgraded by Nestl, offering them increased opportunities to sell their milk to the company. Nestl is currently the largest private sector collector of milk in the country.
Its payment to local dairy farmers over the last three years alone amounts to over Rs.10.5 billion.
The enhanced milk chilling centre was inaugurated by Minister of Rural Economic Affairs P. Harrison in commemoration of World Milk Day.
The unit will benefit around 300 farmers in the area with increased chilling and storage facilities, enabling them to sell more milk and keep it fresh until it is taken to the Nestl factory in Kurunegala, for manufacturing its wide portfolio of dairy-based products.
World Milk Day is a day established by the Food and Agriculture Organisation of the United Nations, to recognise the importance of milk as a global food.
Said Minister of Rural Economic Affairs P. Harrison, Dairy products are widely considered to be a foundation of health but current milk supply does not meet full consumer demand. There is huge potential for growth in the dairy industry and we have been working tirelessly over the years to help Sri Lanka become self-sufficient in its local dairy needs. Nestl has been our oldest partner from the private sector to support our efforts, investing billions of rupees every year for training and development and in payment to farmers for their milk. I have witnessed firsthand their commitment to using local milk for their products, and look forward to their continued support for the betterment of the dairy industry and local community.
Said Shivani Hegde, Nestl Lankas Managing Director, Nutrition and wellness have always been at the core of Nestl products, and milk has always been an important part of this endeavor. By helping our dairy farmers to increase supply, we are not only supporting rural livelihoods, but also helping our consumers to increase milk consumption through nutritionally enriched milk products and delicious dairy treats.

The other side of sharks
The shark is supposed to be the most dreaded marine inhabitant. Those who have seen jaws on the wide screen or on television will get a glimpse of the blood-thirsty reputation of sharks. It was the biggest fish story of our time. It is indeed a fishy story because scientists and marine biologists have found sharks to be very timid creatures.
It is, however, a beautiful fish. Unfortunately, its sleek body structure, with its large streamlined horizontal mouth and, the in-turned set of sharp teeth make its name synonymous with undesirable humans in society.
Various sizes
In our country, people often refer to Gini kana mora, mini kana mora or niyoma mora. Nevertheless, the shark is a much sought after fish when there is a mother to be awaiting the arrival of the new comer to the world.
It is said that a kiri mora dish would make a mother to suckle more milk. Sharks come in various sizes. We are more familiar with the small kiri-mora. Sharks lived in the oceans 400 million years ago, long before the dinosaurs.
They have evolved into many species. Their sizes could be different as a mouse from an elephant. The thresher fish has a very long tail. The angel shark is flat as a skate.
The hammer-headed shark looks grotesque among all line creatures with its eyes located quite a distance apart on the head. The swordfish has a chainsaw a type of long snout. The Whale shark is the biggest and many measures about 15 metres.
Dissecting tables
There are more than 350 species of sharks. We have seen only a very few. In our own country how many of us would have placed sharks measuring around 25cm on dissecting tables and displayed their cranial nerves as neatly as possible at the Advanced Level classes of yesteryear.
One shudders to think of the sharks that have sacrificed their lives for the glory of science. Humans save lives of their own kind and of all living creatures, as doctors and veterinary surgeons because of them.
Their studies on sharks have shown to the world, the true lifestyle of a lovely creature. Their sacrifices have not been in vain.
They are fascinating. Their teeth and the scales along with their body structure and functions have amazed scientists.
A dental conveyor belt ensures it a never ending set of sharp teeth. Its bite could shear off a prey. Its organs of sense are unique.
It could, while swimming, detect the blood of decaying fish even when diluted to one in a million parts of water. Its night vision and hearing are unbelievable. It can sense the erratic splashes of injured fish or dumping of garbage overboard.
Even the roar of helicopter blades or the roar of blades over floating devices being constructed by workmen, attract sharks from long distance. They were sure of finding food at the location.
Apart from all these assets, it is supposed to have a sixth sense. It can actually see electricity. Muscles of all animals radiate electrical impulses. Salt adds to its conductivity. So, the shark could spot a dead carcas of a fish under the seabed with ease.
They are avid travellers. At times up to 15,000 kilometres. They follow the ocean currents. It could move up rivers during high tide.
It supple body could make it a lovely turn like how a dog turns round and round trying to get at its tail. In a whiplash movement, the shark could take off at around 80 km. They have no swim blades, like other fish. So, they have to keep moving. Otherwise, they sink.
Sharks are amazingly healthy. Their wounds heal quickly. Their blood contains antibodies that can combat a vast array of diseases.
They never get cancer or malignant growths that cause death and suffering to humans and other animals. Its unique immune system could ward off certain chemicals that would kill a human being.
They have fed sharks an extremely potent carcinogen called aflatoxin found in the mould of corn, peanuts and other field crops and found that they were not able to produce a single tumour in the shark.
One of the sharks most potent cancer fighter is its unusual skeleton, made up of entire cartilage.
Robert Langer a chemical engineer at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has discovered an ingredient in shark cartilage that stops blood vessels fro feeding and growing tumours. It could be the cure for cancer.
Age conquers all. The ageing process of the shark is the same as ours. Diminishing of ones eyesight is a sign of age. Scientists are baffled how the sharks lenses are not affected by age. No cases of cataract have been detected.
Greatest enemy
A chemical extracted from shark cartilage is being tested to find its curative properties in the treatment of burn victims. The shark is the most overexploited fish. Millions of sharks are caught for food.
The sharks greatest enemy is the man. A creature that had lived two hundred times than man is reaching extinction. They grow slowly and produce very few young.
Humans mutilate sharks. Their fins are chopped off and the bleeding fish is thrown back to the sea.
The processed fins are dipped in rice wine and enjoyed by some humans while the finless, bleeding sharks become a prey to other bloodthirsty inhabitants of the sea.
The shark is a friend of man. Shark liver oil with all its vitamins makes children and even adults remain healthy. Capsules are more acceptable because of the fishy taste. Its lovely grey colour is used by us. Sharkskin suit, shoes and handbags are quite popular.
It is the only fish that keep our oceans clean. Without them, the worlds oceans would be filled with sick, dying and dead fish.

Pakistan overhaul urged after shameful defeat
ISLAMABAD : Pakistan faced calls for a total overhaul on Monday after slumping to a "shameful defeat" against arch-rivals India at the Champions Trophy in England.
The highly anticipated match at Edgbaston proved anti-climactic as Pakistan were thrashed by 124 runs, extending their winless streak against India to three years.
While Indian media rejoiced in the "Mother of all Mismatches", Pakistan newspapers held nothing back in their criticism.
"Pakistan suffers shameful defeat at the hands of India in Champions Trophy, Green Shirts fail in every department," said Jang, Pakistan's highest-circulation newspaper.
Former captain Shahid Afridi was among several ex-players to call for a major shake-up in the wake of the humiliating defeat.
"The gap between Indian and Pakistani teams is bigger than ever! India has evolved & we are way behind now," he said on his Twitter account. "We need to overhaul approach, mindset & work on improving our stagnating skills and play with clear minds."AFP

Panicked Qatar shoppers stock up as Gulf rift bites
QATAR: Shoppers in Doha were taking no chances on Monday despite Qatari officials reassuring residents there was no need to panic after Saudi Arabia imposed a de facto food blockade.
Qatar shares its only land border with Saudi Arabia, and relies heavily on food imports, much of it from Gulf countries.
Arab nations including Saudi Arabia and Egypt on Monday cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting extremism, in the biggest diplomatic crisis to hit the region in years.
Multiple queues up to 25-people deep formed in Carrefour supermarket in Dohas City Center mall, one of the busiest shopping areas in the Qatari capital, hours after five Arab states cut diplomatic ties with the kingdom.
Shoppers piled trollies and baskets high and shelves were stripped of essentials such as milk, rice and chicken.
Among the hundreds of shoppers desperately searching for staple goods was Azir, a Sri Lankan who went to the store when relatives called him from home after watching the news on television.
I was asleep. My family phoned me and woke me up from Sri Lanka, he said, his trolley full of nappies for his 18-month-old child.
I came because of the crisis.
Qatar imports goods such as chicken from Saudi Arabia, and locals quickly took to social media on Monday to complain they would have to eat poultry from Oman instead.
Ernest, from Lebanon, said he knew he had to go shopping because others would rush to the shops.
Its a cycle of panic and I needed to get pasta, he said, as he shopped with his young family -- pushing not one but two trollies. The story was the same across town at one of the several Monoprix stores, where staff said it had been one of the busiest days at work they had known.
In the nearby Al-Meera supermarket, shoppers again packed the store, including Denis from Germany who was convinced that the crisis was just a temporary storm.
This is just a yellow card, he said of the country due to host footballs 2022 World Cup.
What can they do It is one of the richest countries in the world.
To try to avoid widespread panic-buying, Qatars government issued a statement claiming that shipping routes and airspace will remain open for imports.
The Qatari Government will take all necessary measures to... thwart attempts to influence and harm the Qatari society and economy, the statement said.
One sector of the economy which could be badly hurt is exports, including goods such as machinery, electronic equipment or livestock transported by road to Saudi Arabia.
According to the United Nations, Qatari exports to Saudi Arabia totalled $896 million (796 million euros) in 2015.
The severing of ties is also potentially bad news for the service industry, including hotels and cab drivers in Doha.
Saudis usually flock to Qatar on holiday during Eid al-Fitr at the end of the Muslim holy fasting month of Ramadan.
But with a travel ban now imposed by Riyadh, takings could be down for many south Asian cab drivers who rely heavily on tourists.
This is very bad news, very bad news, said Raihan, a driver from India. All Saudis come here for Eid. - AFP

[Parliament (07-06-2017)]
Black sheep in Army should be dealt with: Mangala
There could be black sheep even in an excellent Army. They should be dealt with in accordance with law to protect the dignity of the Army, Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera said.
He said if there are suspects in the Army who assaulted or abducted media personnel, abducted children in Wellawatta and killed them to take ransom, they should be dealt with according to law even if they had done them on instructions of the superiors, irrespective of the suspects uniforms or the robes, to protect the dignity of the Army.
Minister Samaraweera made theses observations yesterday in response to the adjournment motion moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
The minister said there are attempts by various groups to create racial conflicts. He said a Muslim business institution had been damaged in Maharagama recently. The minister said the Police would not allow to continue these acts.
The government has not entered into any agreement as the Joint Opposition complained, said Minister Samaraweera said.
By co-sponsoring the UN resolution, we have restored the sovereignty of Sri Lanka. I beg the opposition members not to lie. Anybody can read the resolution, he said.
He said 48 countries stood with Sri Lanka on March 23 in Geneva.
We have to be proud that it was a quarter of the globe, including UK, USA, China, Russia and Australia, Minister Samaraweera said.
Those countries appreciated the countrys constructive path. Opposition members thought with the election of Donald Trump as USA President, the government in Sri Lanka would collapse. But even his representative to Geneva
spoke with me and appreciated the move of Sri Lanka as an important step which would restore the countrys sovereignty and dignity, he said.
He said if the previous government continued on its path, the international community might have imposed economic sanctions, preventing the leaders going abroad and also resulting in closure of many factories in the country.
It was me who went to Geneva in 2015 February and submitted that we did not accept its move and emphasised that the new government had been offered mandate to find solutions within the country, Minister Samaraweera said.
The minister said there is no more international action against Sri Lanka.
Joint Opposition members have no understanding of the new global trends. We cant treat certain groups differently, he said.
Minister Samaraweera said Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, Malays and Burghers should get together to go forward as a nation.
House to take up adjournment debateon floods on Friday
Parliament will take up an adjournment debate on the recent flood situation of the country on Friday.
The adjournment motion will be moved by the JVP. The Committee on Parliamentary Business headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya, which met on Monday has decided to take up a full day adjournment debate on the flood havoc caused by heavy rains.
Over 200 lives were lost and thousands of people were displaced due to recent floods and landslides in the country.
The debate will be held from 11.30am to 6.30pm. Disaster Management Minister Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, making the reply speech on the adjournment motion, will brief the House on the current situation and future measures.
Meanwhile, Minister Yapa replying to a question by UPFA MP Douglas Devananda yesterday in Parliament said the National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) paid Rs 3.3billion last year as disaster relief, adding that some more claims are to be settled raising the amount to Rs 4 billion.
This insurance is a good mechanism. Only Sri Lanka has such a system in Asia. Last year, we paid Rs. 300 million as insurance premium. This year, we will pay Rs. 500 million, he said.
Asked by NFF Leader MP Wimal Weerawansa whether the international insurance companies involved with the NITF have refused to pay as insurance premium has not been paid, the minister said there was no such an issue.
Speaker expressescondolences on landslide and flood victims
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya at the outset of Parliamentary sessions yesterday expressed the condolences of the House on the lives lost in recent landslide and flood disasters.
Making a special announcement, the Speaker drew the attention of the House to the need of a well-organised disaster management mechanism in the country to minimise the loss of lives and property damages in any future natural calamity.
The Speaker recalled with respect the sacrifice made by the Air Force officer who died during a lifesaving mission. On behalf of Parliament, I extend thanks to tri-forces personnel, public servants, local and international organisations, voluntary groups and the media for their support to help the people at the time of the tragedy.
We should come up with a disaster management mechanism to face natural calamities. Such an effort may cost a large sum of money, but given the international recognition, the country has received, we will be able to find foreign funds for the purpose.
I request Parliamentarians to join hands in this effort irrespective of party divisions, he said.
Plans to protect Pahiyangala cave from landslide threat
A multidisciplinary evaluation report has been sought on the historical Pahiyangala cave to decide on steps to protect the site from landslide threat, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said.
The minister made this observation in reply to a question by JVP MP Dr. Nalinda Jayatissa in Parliament yesterday. The MP inquired about measures the ministry has taken to conserve the site in the face of recent landslide threats.
Kariyawasam, observing that the ministrys special attention has been drawn to this matter, said that he inspected the site along with the Heads of the Archaeological Department and Central Cultural Fund.
He said Buddhist monks in the site have been asked to evacuate, adding that an alternative place will be provided for them to stay.
He said once the report is submitted, the ministry would decide the future measures, adding that foreign expertise would be sought if necessary.
Sri Lanka fell short of its promise: MahindaSamarasinghe
Sri Lanka did not deliver what it undertook to implement in 2009. The foreign policy was implemented in a way that sent wrong signals to the international community, Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said.
He made these observations yesterday joining the adjournment debate moved by Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardena.
He said to make matters worse, then President Mahinda Rajapaksa went to see Gadafi and Sadam Husein and took photos with them. They appeared in newspapers. It sent wrong signals to the countries that helped us, he said.
The minister said the Human Rights Council of the United Nations accepts the unity governments policies since its foreign policy is non-aligned.
He said when the US joined and took the power of the Human Rights Council, they did not look for those who violated human rights much. If they did so, there were other countries that had violated human rights more than us, Minister Samarasinghe said.
If they were impartial, there were other countries to be aimed at before Sri Lanka. They thought of us as we were out of their group. Our then leader had been to Iraq and Libya, he said.
He said it sent signals that were standing with dictators and with the leaders of countries where democracy was not practised well.
We did not implement a foreign policy that we practise today. Foreign countries expected that there would be reconciliation after the war. They did not speak of an international inquiry in 2012. The forces conducted a disciplined war. They could save 300,000 Tamil people. We took 29 votes in 2009. It dropped to 12 in 2014, Minister Samarasinghe said.
He said the government changed its foreign policy. The UN has welcome the move. The Judiciary is independent, he said.
We have more to execute. The leadership is ready to guarantee equal rights to all communities, the minister said.
OHCHR report on Sri Lanka harmful to nation: Dinesh
Joint Opposition Parliamentary Group Leader Dinesh Gunawardana yesterday said that the report of the Office of the United Nations Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) on Sri Lanka was a deceitful report and its recommendations were harmful to the nation.
MP Gunawardena made these observations yesterday moving an adjournment motion on the United Nations (UN) Resolution on Sri Lanka.
He said the United Nations Human Rights Council (UNHRC) report on Sri Lanka on February 10, 2017 stating that Sri Lanka had formulated a draft of the new Constitution in December 2016 was untrue.
He said according to the report, a draft Constitution was formulated by Sri Lanka last December. This is false. No such draft has been formulated, MP Gunawardena said.
The report is full of lies to mislead the international community, he said.
He said the UN resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka would harm the country. Gunawardena said the resolution calls for international judges in judicial matters of the country. He said this is a breach of the countrys sovereignty. The Constitution does not provide for hybrid courts or a local judicial system consisting of international judges or lawyers. As a result of the resolution, a witch-hunt was carried out against armed forces members. They were arrested and detained without bail. They have been arrested in a vengeful manner, he said.
He said incidents in Manchester and London show that terrorism is a threat to the world. Sri Lanka must be vigilant. The armed forces must have the support of the government to carry out their duties, he said.
MP Gunawardana said India too was in support of Sri Lanka to defeat the LTTE because of the way it was carried out.
He said the government must avoid foreign intervention in judicial matters and carry out post-war investigations in a transparent and independent manner through the local judicial system.

Prodigious odyssey
The sons of Ananda are known for their rigid discipline and uncompromising attitudes when it comes to values in life. Their attitudes are stoic and steadfast. Perfect Prefects meets up with Head Boy of Ananda College Pasindu Herath who is very much dedicated to the core values of his school.
A head prefect needs to be a good leader. He should also have a vision and target and more than anything else he should be on track. He should stick to the plan and be flexible enough to deviate from it and make the right decisions at the right time, said Herath.
When electing a Head Prefect, he is examined on five sectors.
Five-point someone
Firstly Academics  O/L results (A/Ls results are released just after appointment). Term test marks are considered. Then there is sports. (If you are a Coloursman you have a bonus point). The third sector is pertaining to Dhamma Activities. The fourth sector is Clubs and Societies. The fifth sector is the presentation (Case study).
Then there is a two-day interview program. The first day you need to present your certificates, medals and awards and the second day it is all about presentation. You will have to face a case study and give an introduction in English and answer some questions in English and give a brief introduction about yourself and what you have achieved in your life in Sinhala, and present some projects you are planning to do if you are appointed as a member of the senior executive board, stated Herath.
However, for this one has to apply. But not everybody can apply.
But not everyone gets to be an applicant for the post of Head Prefect. It is a selected number of people. If you do not have enough qualifications you will not be able to apply. Firstly you need to become a trainee, you have to become a temporary Assistant Prefect, then a permanent Assistant Prefect, then you have to become a Junior Prefect, and then a senior prefect and then you have to become senior executive board applicant and then you can choose whatever position you want. There are four positions: Head Prefect, Deputy Head Prefect, Chief Senior Supervisor and Senior Supervisor. To be a Head Prefect you need to be extremely qualified. When you become an applicant you have to face the interview and then only do you get the chance. Only grade 12 and 13 students can be prefects. We have a head prefect, then we have three deputy head prefects, three chief Senior supervisors and three senior supervisors, explained Herath.
There are many duties and responsibilities a Head Prefect should undertake at Ananda
Pictures by Thushara Fernando

During the first three or four months of the appointment we have some duties such as the Big Match, then we have the colours night and the Prefects annual encounter which we play with the prefects of Nalanda College. And we have the annual vehicle parade. So these are the four major events in the first four months. Then we have student-oriented programs like the leadership building program and training camps at an Army Camp during the next three or four months. And during the last four months, we have teachers day, and a prefects day called feel the field and we have school renovation project and we have the yearbook containing the projects we have done throughout the year. Those are the duties we undertake. Then we have duties such as general assembly duties and checking bags. Sometimes clubs and societies at Ananda request the prefects guild to assist them in their events in the college, pointed out Herath.
Hard worker
It is mandatory for prefects to come to school on all five days and Saturdays and Sundays at special events. If they cannot make it on one day they need to submit a letter the day before stating the reasons. If they get sick they need to report in sick and bring an excuse letter the following day/days.
An admirable hard worker, Herath is dedicated towards his work.
I am a man with a vision and target. When it comes to my mind I try to put it into action. I visualise it. And I worked towards it have advice and guidance from my brother who was a Head Prefect. If you lose focus then you cannot reach your target. Sometimes when I have missed classes due to my obligations, I go home and call my friends and inquire about class work and material. Sometimes I have Googled A/L stuff, then go to Wikipedia and went to YouTube. Because I had to go to camps and stuff some areas I could not cover. So I asked my brother how to get through things, and he helped me. I explain the actual situation to all my teachers and ask them to help me explain the actual situation. I stay after school and ask them to teach me the areas. I even join other classes to make up for the work I have to do. My parents have always inspired me and they helped me keep in mind the goal I had to reach, elucidated Herath.
Pasindus goal is to be the richest man in Sri Lanka.
I have already got my A/L results. I was appointed Head Prefect November last year and will give up my post November this year. Only after A/Ls can you become a Head Prefect. Now I am moving towards the commerce field (though he did his A/Ls in the math stream). I am a CIMA student on a 100 percent scholarship. I have the chartered institute scholarship as well. As soon as I finish CIMA I will be starting chartered accountancy and I got selected to go the University of Moratuwa. I want to become a CEO of a company, informed Herath.
One of the most valuable lessons Herath has learnt from his school is to make sacrifices.
Perfect responsibility
There are five forms of cadetting at Ananda: Army, Navy, Air Force, Police and Band. I am a police cadet. In 2016 there was no one to take on the responsibility of being the police cadet sergeant. But I was there. But in the month of August, I had my A/Ls and we had a camp in the month of June. There is a one month gap between June and August. If I go there it will be really hard to manage my A/Ls. In this island, Ananda was at the pinnacle of police cadetting. I could not sacrifice the honour and glory Ananda had. So I took the risk and accepted the post of Sergeant and went there with my platoon of 24 Anandians. We went there and we won the camp and became the island best Police cadet platoon. We secured seven trophies out of 11. I became the best police cadet in the island, said Herath triumphantly.
Herath took the risk and even passed his A/Ls well! Herath puts it down to hard work and risk-taking.
I used to be a debater at Ananda and we use to prepare for debates, by running around the school grounds. That way you learn to manage things with life getting busier and busier every day. So we ran around the grounds sweating preparing our arguments. It is hard work. I am a coloursman in three sports. Also, you need to understand your priorities. My current prefect body is very supportive and they are just one phone call away. If I need them they are there. There are 200 people under my command, added Herath.
Heraths message to any boy is to put the school first and be friendly towards everyone. He says work for the glory of the school and they you can get to the top at Ananda and you will be able to be very good leaders at Ananda. And he says  Never Give up!
Before going to sports we go to the Buddhist Shrine at Ananda and pray. Then we go and meet the principal. Before the match, we get into the huddle and for 30 seconds we close our eyes and visualise the shrine. So we respect the Shrine a lot. That is the Buddhist environment we are brought up in, summed up Herath.
Pasindu as Cadet-Practising shooting.

Rain ruins Australias run chase
London: Australia face a make or break Champions Trophy showdown with England after their Group A clash against Bangladesh was abandoned due to rain on Monday.
Steve Smiths side were chasing 183 to beat Bangladesh at The Oval when persistent drizzle forced the players from the field.
Having scored 83-1 from 16 overs, Australia only needed to play for four more overs to be eligible to win via the Duckworth-Lewis rule for rain-affected games.
Instead, Smith and his team-mates were reduced to anxiously looking at weather updates and peering upwards for any sign of a break in the slate grey sky.
Unfortunately for Australia, who bowled out Bangladesh for 182, the rain became heavier and the match was called off at 2019 GMT.
Australia will be cursing their luck as they were also frustrated by bad weather when their opening group fixture against New Zealand was abandoned, although on that occasion they were in a less commanding position.
With England, who won their opener against Bangladesh, due to play New Zealand in the next Group A fixture, two-time champions Australia will have to beat the hosts in Birmingham on June 10 to qualify for the semi-finals.
Its a little bit frustrating not to get a result in, Smith said.
Of course I didnt want to go off. I was happy to keep batting through the rain.
The umpires are there to make a decision. To be fair it was raining reasonably hard when we did come off.
The groundsmen, they perhaps could have shown a bit more urgency being a big tournament. But they did the best job they could.
Tamim Iqbals 95 was the highlight for Bangladesh, who are winless and face New Zealand in their final group tie.
Despite Iqbals best efforts, Mitchell Starcs spell of four wickets in nine balls ensured Australia had the upper hand before the rain arrived.
Aware that ominous clouds were gusting in, Australia needed to get off to a fast start to have a chance of winning on the D/L rule if the required 20 overs were bowled.
Aaron Finch and David Warner both crushed a pair of fours as Australia raced to 37-0 in six overs. Warner was especially aggressive, pulling one tame delivery from Mashrafe Mortaza off his hip and away to the fence in a flash.
Rubel Hossain briefly stemmed the tide when the Bangladesh seamer dismissed Finch lbw with an inswinger the opener couldnt handle as he played across his pads. When Warners total reached 37 he had passed 4,000 runs in one-day internationals.
Only South Africas Hashim Amla and West Indies legend Viv Richards hit that milestone quicker than Warners 93 innings.
After the rain began to pour, Australia briefly had hope when the covers were taken off and the umpires announced play would start at 1930 GMT.
But instead the rain returned before the game could restart and Australias hopes of victory were washed away. AFP

RPCs profitably diversify through sustainable oil palm cultivation
Under the management of Sri Lankan Regional Plantation Companies (RPCs), the domestic plantation sector has been able to achieve important progress towards the diversification of its traditional mix of cash crops.
Internationally, palm oil remains a ubiquitous part of modern life, being commonly utilised as primary ingredient in food, soaps, cosmetics, candles, bio-fuel, animal feed and many other consumer products.
While approximately 64.5 million tonnes of palm oil was produced globally in 2016, demand for the commodity has outpaced global production.
The first efforts towards the establishment of the very first oil palm plantations in Sri Lanka were carried out by Carson Cumberbatch in the 1960s, before subsequently coming under the management of Watawala Plantations PLC, currently the largest oil palm cultivator in the country with approximately 3,157 hectares under cultivation under a diversification effort that began over a decade ago.
Following in these pioneering footsteps, several other RPCs have since entered the sector. Namunukula Plantations PLC manages an extent of 2,020 hectares of oil palm under cultivation, followed by Elpitiya Plantations PLC with 1,571 hectares and Agalawatte Plantations PLC with 1,294 hectares at the start of the current financial year.
Together, these top three producers also operate an oil palm processing plant as a highly successful joint venture.
Kegalle Plantations PLC is planning to plant 1,125 acres of oil palm in its current rubber fields, while Bogawantalawa Tea Estates PLC has also announced its intentions to plant 700 hectares of oil palm in the near future.
Among these prominent RPC diversifications into the oil palm industry is Elpitiya Plantations PLC. of Talgaswala Estate, a low country plantation situated in close proximity to Galle, which is the site of one of the island's most successful oil palm plantations. Managed by the Aitken Spence Group since 1997, the company's seven low elevation estates have undergone a strategic realignment following a more concerted diversification into oil palm cultivation that expands on the preliminary oil palm crop established in Sri Lanka during the 1960s. Its General Manager - Low Country, A.G. Geethkumara is a veteran of the industry who possesses extensive academic qualifications in agriculture and plantation management.
Oil palm is an extremely valuable crop that is highly prized on international markets due to the sheer variety of applications for the oil it produces. While demand for oil palm is already extremely high, consumers are becoming increasingly aware of the environmental impact of irresponsible oil palm cultivation, they are also more willing to pay a premium for sustainably cultivated alternatives, and this is an area which we are confident that Sri Lankan RPCs can tap into, given the exemplary and extremely stringent environmental conservation standards in place within the RPC sector, he said.
At present there is almost no evidence whatsoever to show that oil palm is in-and-of-itself, detrimental to the environment and these findings are based on extensive research over an extended period of time across globe.
In fact most of the resistance to oil palm cultivation stems more from a reluctance to adapt mindsets than it does with the actual physical properties of oil palm. But here too, attitudes are changing very quickly, and within our own plantations, we've had no real issues with oil palm, and this too is because our employees themselves are strongly in favour of oil palm cultivation. Simply put, it requires less labour to earn substantially more per harvest than any of the other major cash crops, he said.
The fact that Sri Lanka has such strict regulations in place around the plantation industry, both through our statutory obligations and through voluntary binding standards imposed on the companies as part of securing the numerous international certifications in which Sri Lankan regional plantation companies (RPCs) have set international benchmarks, Geethkumara said.
Oil palm requires far less labour to harvest and the harvesting work is less frequent and less intensive than what is required to maintain our tea plantations. These factors align extremely well with the current trends in our industry, at a time when labour shortages are a serious challenge."
Given this fact we are able to gather significantly greater value out of each harvest since 25% of the total weight is oil. Hence, this crop stands as one of the most promising options for crop diversification in Sri Lanka, Geethkumara said.

Samuels batters Afghans in Windies romp
Basseterre: Marlon Samuels was at his most imperious with an unbeaten 89 to guide the West Indies to a seven-wicket victory over Afghanistan in the final fixture of the three-match T20 International series at Warner Park in St Kitts on Monday.
Replying to the tourists total of 146 for six, the right-handers highest-ever T20 International innings took the home side to the target with four balls to spare and completed a 3-0 series sweep.
Samuels innings occupied 66 deliveries and was embellished with three sixes and nine fours.
He deservedly won both the Man of the Match and Man of the Series awards in a format of the game in which he has excelled in the latter stage of his long international career.
I know my role in this team and it was important to stay out there and ensure we got the target, he said after victory was completed in partnership with Jason Mohammed.
Partnerships are important to any run chase and it was good that a couple of us worked together effectively.
Afghanistan, who now prepare to take on the West Indies in three One-Day Internationals in St Lucia starting on Friday, were left to rue a costly miss by their most experienced player that allowed Samuels to be the match-winner.
Having topscored with 38 after his team chose to bat first, Mohammad Nabi dropped a sharp caught-and-bowled chance offered by the batsman when he was just on 40. Thereafter his batting was flawless and not even the belated introduction of the main bowling threat, leg-spinner Rashid Khan, could contain him.
Samuels featured in half-century partnerships with opening batsman Evin Lewis and Mohammed, whose unbeaten 23 ensured there was no middle-order wobble that could have opened the door to a consolation win for the visitors.
It was important for us to complete the sweep because if we hadnt done so there would have been all sorts of things said about our team, said West Indies captain Carlos Brathwaite. They may be minnows in international cricket but we respect them and there was no way we were going to take them for granted.
Earlier, Nabis innings and 35 from Noor Ali Zadran led Afghanistans batting effort against a home side that appeared to be lacking in intensity with the series already wrapped up following comfortable wins in the first two matches at the same venue.
Wicketkeeper-batsman Shafiqullah Shafaq chipped in with 25 to ensure the West Indies were left with a challenging target.
Kesrick Williams was again the most successful of the home bowlers, finishing with three for 34 to lift his wicket tally in the series to eight. There was a bit of concern though at the end of his spell as he appeared to be suffering the discomfort of a back injury when he bowled Shafiqullah with the final ball of his four-over allotment.
This was very disappointing but it is still a step in the right direction for us to be playing teams like the West Indies, said Afghanistan captain Asghar Stanikzai. We are hopeful that this experience will serve us well for the one-day matches to come. AFP

Saudi revokes Qatar Airways license
Saudi Arabias aviation authority has formally withdrawn Qatars licence to land and fly in the country.
Saudis General Authority of Civil Aviation also ordered its offices to to be closed within 48 hours. In a statement, the authority also said licences granted to Qatar Airways employees would be withdrawn.
Saudi Arabia had already suspended flights to and from Qatar on Monday, amid a diplomatic row between the kingdom and Qatar.
Qatar Airways is wholly owned by the Qatari government. The airline group employs more than 40,000 people worldwide. The chief executive of Qatar Airways, Akbar al-Baker, is also a non-executive director of Heathrow Airport Holdings, which operates Londons biggest airport. Saudi Arabia and several other countries have cut ties with Qatar, accusing it of supporting terrorism in the Gulf region.
Other neighbours, including the United Arab Emirates (UAE), have closed their airspace to Qatari planes.
Six countries - Bahrain, Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Yemen, Libyas eastern-based government and the Maldives - cut diplomatic ties with Qatar on Monday.
Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have given Qatari nationals two weeks to leave and banned their own citizens from travelling to Qatar.
Doha, Qatars capital, is a major hub for international flight connections.
Other airlines affected by the airspace restrictions include Qatar Airways, Etihad Airways and Emirates. When avoiding Saudi Arabia, their massive - and only - neighbour, Qatars planes are having to take more indirect routes, leading to longer flight times.

In the shadow of metamorphosis
Book reviews
Title: The Shadow
Author: Professor Siri Gunasinghe
Translator: Dr Hemamali Gunasinghe
Publisher: Vijitha Yapa Publications
The title page of this writer's copy of Dr. Siri Gunasinghe's Hevanella bears '1960' as the year of the publication of its first edition and, at the end of its 147 page text it carries my inscription, 're-read: 1983', which means, the allure of its story had not been lost to this reader even after 23 years: it speaks for itself; and, now after 50 years (2010), its English translation has appeared in the book stalls. It has taken half a century, but this writer feels, the quality of Dr Hemamali Gunasinghe's translation (The Shadow) is well worth the long wait for it. It is not intended here, to speak of the Sinhala book at any length, except to say that when it first appeared in 1960, it took the Sinhala reading public quite by surprise for, it may safely be said, nothing of its genre had been seen before by them and so, no wonder, their critical response was on a very wide spectrum; but it was seen, some writers of repute in this country, like Martin Wickramasinghe, it was evident from their comments, had taken it as a landmark work.
SG's novel, The Shadow in essence, is a comprehensive analytical study of the workings of the mind of a University Fresher trying to adjust himself to the changing circumstances of the new environment he has entered; the violent trauma he goes through in the process forms the warp and weft of the web that SG weaves his story, of the responses and reactions of the new University entrant, Jinadasa caught in an irresistible tornado of events and circumstances which turn out to be the absorbing saga of the tortured soul of Jinadasa trying desperately to reorient himself but, in the end, submitting to forces too overwhelming for him to overcome. In this conflict of forces the traditional entrenched values of a conservative Sinhala Buddhist society on the one hand and, on the other the sophisticated neo-urban cultural values are at issue.
The new forces emerging, in which Jinadasa is caught from the moment he enters the new environment, the University, start the process of wearing down the many inhibitions with which he has come which are now in imminent danger of being breached: they are the traditional codes of conduct which have been inculcated in him from his childhood in the village under two main formative influences  his mother at home, and the Buddhist monk in the village temple. His first natural reaction to these new forces is violent resistance true, but their siege on his defences is relentless and sustained and they slowly but steadily crumble.
Therefore his first vacation at home from University is a restless, twilight period; he is already beginning to feel alienated; his first inclination is to break loose from the umbilical cord of his mother's domination and other fetters of traditional discipline which he felt, were standing counter to his new found ways of freedom. The ongoing battle between his former ID and his present one is violent where the new is trying to assert itself.
In the meantime, the transformation of Jinadasa is moving ahead; the transgressions against the former concepts and practices are consequent upon the new system of values, right and wrong that are slowly building in him.

Simple ways to focus when you dont feel like working
A Life of Productivity:
Today is the first day back after the long weekendif you find your productivity and energy levels waning, as I usually do after stepping back from my work for a little bit, this post is for you. At times like this, here are some strategies I use to re-engage with my work!
Set a few intentions
Productivity is the process of becoming more deliberate about how you spend your time, attention, and energy. Intentions help you zone in on the best possible things. Before you begin working, define a few things you want to accomplish by the time the day and week are over. These intentions can be simple or complicated, large or smallthe key is to step back from your work and ask whats important, both today and over the next seven days.
Work slower
Working slower calms you and allows you to work more deliberately and purposefully. This week, try working slower and on fewer things at once if you find yourself struggling to become re-immersed in your work.
Disconnect
Its easier to succumb to distractions when you have less energy and willpower to resist them. To combat this, consider disconnecting from the internet while you do your most important, complicated tasks.
Download a distractions blocker
If you cant disconnect completely, download a distractions blocker like Cold Turkey or Freedom. These apps let you pre-decide which sites you want to block yourself from accessing so you can focus more deeply on your work. (A small part of me almost feels relieved when I enable one of these apps I feel more comfortable doing my most important work because I know Im not able to access distracting websites)
Caffeinating can be key
As I wrote the other week, when taken in reasonable doses, caffeine boosts your mental and physical performance in pretty much every way. Drink an extra cup of tea or coffee if you feel your energy waning when you get to the office. While you may experience a larger energy crash later in the day, youll also get a significant energy boost in the moment.
Carve out some time to daydream
This is perfect for your low energy periods. Curiously, the more diffused our attention, the more creative we become because were able to connect more disparate ideas in our head. Try spending a bit more time daydreaming this weeklike by going for a walk without your phone, or working out without listening to anything.
This will mean you can better mentally mull over any challenging problems, and surface any insights waiting to be uncovered.
Take more breaks than usual
Breaks afford you the ability to not only recharge, but also set intentions for what to work on next. During these breaks, give yourself the attentional space to daydream if you can! Grabbing a coffee with a few coworkers is also a great way to catch up while becoming more productivecultivating deeper relationships with your colleagues will make you more engaged in your work.
Work shorter days
Its a lot more difficult to focus on your work when half of your team is on vacation.Try clocking fewer hours this week if you have less work than usual and have flexibility in your schedule. Chances are youve earned itand if youre like 55% of Americans, youll likely have vacation days to spare this year.
Work around your energy levels
While our energy levels can fluctuate quite a bit over a typical day, they can fluctuate even more after a long weekend. Be extra mindful of how much energy you have throughout the day.
To become more productive, work on your most demanding tasks when you have the most energy, and less demanding tasks, such as maintenance and admin work, when your energy dips.

Special commodity levy on imported sugar increased
The special commodity levy on imported sugar has been increased by Rs.10 per kilogramme from midnight yesterday. The last time the levy was increased was in September 2016; when it was increased by Rs.2 per kilogramme for white sugar and Rs.15 per kilogramme on raw sugar, in order to support locally produced sugar which was about to enter the market.
Sri Lanka produces around 50,000 MT of raw (Brown) sugar annually which is less than 10 percent of the annual brown sugar need. The decision to increase the levy has been taken by the Cabinet Sub Committee on Cost of Living.

Sports Ministry refutes Susanthikas allegations
Sports Ministry Acting Secretary Somaratna Vidanapathirana issuing a statement on allegations levelled against the ministry by Olympic silver medalist Susanthika Jayasinghe yesterday said he feels sorry for Susanthika Jayasinghes plight today as all the governments that were in power since 2000 helped her financially and also donated houses and vehicles for her use.
He said the ministry also donated Rs 1.1 million on a request by her to publish her biography.
Vidanapathirana said that the Sports Ministry has not terminated her services.
The only problem was that her April allowance had been delayed.
The former government had appointed her as an advisor to the Ministry of Sports and her tenure ended in 2015 when the present government took office.
When Dayasiri Jayasekera took over as Sports Minister he decided to obtain her services on a monthly allowance of Rs 60 000 and a fuel allowance of Rs 15 000 till she reaches the age of 60.
The minister also submitted a Cabinet paper to seek approval to appoint her as a consultant for training and picking of athletes for international competitions.
She should perform her duties and submit a report to the Ministry Secretary regarding the training programs at the beginning of each month. She was also given an office room at the Sports Ministry building.
If she is undergoing financial difficulties what she should do is not to sell her Olympic medal but to fulfill her obligations as an adviser to the Minister of Sports for which she is entitled to a reasonable salary.

Sree Veena legend lives on
He was a contemporary of famous musicians in the likes of legendary Dayananda Gunawardena, Premasiri Khemadasa and Pandit Amaradeva. In addition he was an acclaimed 'A' grade singer, in Hindustani and Bengali as well, examiner of music, 'A' grade instrumentalist in ballet, stage, films, teledrama, director, conductor, inventor of the original instrument called the 'Soorthar' and then the more sophisticated 'Sree Veena'.
Dr Lionel Algama the renowned, gifted and multifaceted musician, innovator of musical instruments, teacher, conductor and composer of music passed away on May 18, 2008, at the age of 74.
He made an enthralling demonstration of the 'Sree Veena' as far back as 1979 at a musical recital at the Bharathiya Vidya Bhawan (UK Centre), an imminent Institute of Indian Culture, London, for an exclusive Brahmin music community.
He successfully wrote two theses for his doctorate, the first of which was Teaching of Music and the other was Development of the Chordophones in East and West in the years 1978 and in 1979. The final perfected product of the "Sree Veena" was completed only in 1994 after making lots of research and perseverance. He had a knack for combining sounds and the Sree Veena could which he invented could bring out the pooled sounds of several music instruments, hence it could be utilised for a solo recital without any other musical instruments.
Essentially for amateurs
He was a native of Siyane Korale in the Gampaha District who had his primary education at Veyangoda Central. His father, a wealthy businessman Jinadasa Perera, owned a theatrical company essentially for amateurs. It was a routine each evening for artistes to conduct rehearsals at their residence.

Besides his own "Soothar" he has mastered the Sithar, Sarod, Harmonium, Piano, Organ, Mandolin, Tennor, Banjo, Guitar, Esraj, Torshani, Santoor, Violin and Tablano which no other musician in Sri Lanka is so competent who could have challenged him. Even today it is intricate for any famed musician to live up to his standards in playing such a range of musical instruments.
Aesthetic music
He was a gifted and the best innovator Sri Lanka had ever produced, It is unfortunate that his contribution to the field of music had not been agreed for due recognition by the administrators in Aesthetic music, He excelled at classical and jazz concerts and Ballets in New Delhi, Calcutta, Bombay, Benares, Jaipur and Pakistan between the years 1955 to 1959. These recitals were applauded, hailed and appreciated by numerous types of audiences.

He was incidentally requested to perform before the institute's Board of Directors and was allowed to perform only after passing a rehearsal. The performance was for charity which had fascinated the audience by keeping them spellbound.
From 1959 to 1989 he worked as a music teacher on a long stint at Thurstan College, Colombo as the teacher of music. He created the College theme song. President Mahinda Rajapaksa was a pupil of his and during the time of his brief illness had instructed all hospital authorities to give his mentor all necessary care and attention.

Solo instrument
He had composed music for a number of stage plays such as Dayananda Gunawardena's Naribena, Romeo and Juliet, Sinahawa, Nuwana Podiya, Tikirimalie, Oedipus, Kusa Pabawathie and The Horror of Mahahena. He also directed music for ballets: Karadiya, Nala Damayanthi, Sakunika, Ginihora, Rankikily, Kinkini Kolama, Capture, Isolation, Making of Men, Through the Desert and Macbeth. In addition, he has composed, organised and conducted music for several feature programs in Hindustani, Classical and Light music.
He performed his new instrument Sree Veena in a solo concert at Elphinstone Theatre, Maradana on January 7, 1996. Professor of Music, University of Delhi Ajit Singh Paintal was the chief guest had this to say: The Sree Veena innovated by Algama has a unique sound quality of many Indian instruments like Sarod, Sitar and Swar-Mandal all combined together into a solo instrument. Algama's performance marked with highly skilled technique with his aptitude in several Indian and Western musical instruments. It is a unique experience to listen to Algama playing on Sree Veena, the Indian Ragas with such depth.
Dr Lionel Algama celebrated his 70th birthday on March 24, 2005. To commemorate the golden jubilee of his musical career it was his intention to celebrate the occasion with a solo music recital with the aid of his invention, the Sree Veena. Unfortunately, due to the tsunami catastrophe, he was compelled to postpone the event without any hesitation.

Title: Golden Rays on the Dark Moon

Jayantha Mangala Rajapakses work is not just an autobiography. The book, highly edifying and informative, is a rags-to-riches story of a son of the soil from Galle, the South of Sri Lanka, who, in his own words, is a person who became rich through a dint of perseverance. This richly readable book, written in a great literary style, is a must-read for any budding entrepreneur.
From the halcyon days of the 1950s, just after the country gained independence from our colonial masters, as the book describes, the authors childhood in the village of Urawatte, his education, the insurgency of 1971 when the Island was plunged into bloody chaos for the first time in contemporary history, his work for the Government and a multinational organization, financial struggles and mastering daunting challenges, deeply woven into the story of his teenage love affair, in which, unlike in many such histories, ended in success.
This beautifully written book, awakening nostalgic memories of a peaceful Island of simple and unpretentious folk, is permeated with the authors deep adherence to Buddhism, according to which he always fashioned his path.
The way he writes about his partings from loved ones at various points of his life where he was compelled to go abroad, brings about a pang to readers. The reader is compelled to identify with the author in his endeavours and be mesmerised to keep on turning the pages, to find out how everything turned out.
Among many entrepreneurs from the South of Sri Lanka who made successes of their lives and enriching those of many others, this is an enlightening and motivating book, highlighting the authors way of thinking, Where there is a will, there is a way, his indomitable courage in the face of adversity and perseverance.

## Title: Supply Chain Digital Transformation

Supply Chain Digital Transformation
In the world of lean, just-in time manufacturing, purchasing raw materials or commodities at the right price and ensuring their delivery at the right time is a critical success factor. All the six-sigma black belts in the world cannot make a manufacturing business profitable if they procure major input materials at the wrong price.
This need for precision management of the supply chain has, rightly, elevated the role of the procurement and supply chain throughout manufacturing and indeed, non-manufacturing sectors. But it hasnt necessarily elevated the tools needed to enable this highly interconnected, extremely time-sensitive and data-intensive global commodity supply chain.
Traditional tools that cover the supply chain from manufacturer to consumer are undoubtedly sophisticated systems, but they cant cover the purchasing of commodities and raw materials from suppliers with anything like the same level of sophistication. All too often managing commodities is handled in spreadsheets.
The world today is evolving into a massive digital network, and its an ongoing battle for many organizations to stay connected and in communication with their trading partner networks. This complex nature of global business means technologies and requirements change without notice, and just when companies think they found a tool that works for them, a new requirement emerges.
This also means supply chains are more global and connected than ever before, and just as complex given the rapid adoption of Internet of Things (IoT)-connected devices, RFID chips, GPS tracking and other modern technologies. However, legacy systems supporting these networks often dont integrate with one another and create organizational data silos. Central visibility into the information flowing within and beyond the four walls of an organization is limited, and gaining clearer insights into your supply chain cannot happen organically.
And thats too bad, because across the connected supply chain easily one of the largest and most critical elements in any global company there is a wealth of valuable insights. Things like manufacturing lead times, the cost of various raw materials and subassemblies, product availability data for suppliers, shipping and logistics estimates, and demand forecasts from end customers could bring immediate value to a business and its partner network.
Such information, when properly aggregated, gives organizations the ability to proactively shape demand based on pricing and promotions, for example, as well as deliver precise inventory levels across warehouses and stores for original equipment manufacturers (OEMs) and for retailers. Developing a digital transformation strategy for achieving an end-to-end supply chain can lay the integration framework to help capture and capitalize on this information.
But digital transformation is more than just signing a purchase order for the supposed latest and greatest technology that could change the way you do business. Digital transformation means you equipped your business with the technology and skills to take on its constantly evolving challenges. When companies integrate their people, systems, devices and partner communities, they are positioned to break down organizational silos and gain value from a centralized view of critical business information, especially within the supply chain.
But thats easier said than done. Companies operate in a multi-enterprise business ecosystem, and many are just now beginning to realize the added value of integrating partner and customer communities. Transforming their traditional supply chain frameworks that rely on IT-supported processes into more flexible and collaborative digital models is a massive undertaking, one that cannot happen overnight.
The multimillion-Rupees (or even multibillion-dollar) question, then, is: What is the proper roadmap for leveraging digital innovation in your business to gain visibility, extract value and expand market reach
The answer to that varies by business and even by industry, but by embracing next-generation integration technology that easily adapts to emerging digital requirements and scales with the business, and fully engaging people with the operational strategy of these technologies, organizations enable an agile and connected supply chain.
Key Awareness
Companies undoubtedly must embrace innovation and modernize IT infrastructures, which are foundational to achieve any digital transformation outcome, including the digital customer experience, and the development of a digitally enabled workforce. But the technologies that enable digital transformation are constantly evolving, and they certainly do not come from one vendor or one platform.
Thus, companies should focus on best-of-breed vendors because a focus on a single vendor or platform is unlikely to meet the technology footprint companies require to modernize IT infrastructure and enable operational agility. One essential component of the supply chain infrastructure, however, is business-to-business (B2B) functionality.
Since any business contact outside the walls of an enterprise is a B2B-type relationship, be it connecting with various cloud infrastructures, working with processes and applications that span international boundaries, or interacting with customers and suppliers, it is critically important to have robust B2B functionality driving these transactions.
While integration needs may further extend across the fragile relationship between cloud services, social networks and IoT devices, the B2B foundation is critical. These integration technologies must not only be able to support robust systematic B2B workflows, but also the cooperative workflows, where human interaction, collaboration and approvals are required.
And thats why supporting human integration the role people play in consuming and transmitting dataalso is fundamental to digitally transform the business and its supply chain. Some considerations for enabling your workforce during a strategic business shift include:
* Convenience. Self-service is critical for operations and business users to adopt digital solutions without waiting for the IT department to help. This enables rapid adoption and empowerment among every employee engaged in executing the business processes.
* Security. Data security concerns make headlines every day. Security is paramount, not just for regulatory compliance and governance, but also for business users to know they can safely and securely share information for collaboration across teams and decision-making.
* Insight. Timely business and operational insights to decision-makers deliver the ability to rapidly correct course and/or implement exception-based workflows, a must for a constantly evolving digital ecosystem.
The robust, flexible technology connecting storage repositories, applications and systems must be designed for people-based workflows, but you also need the enterprise-wide commitment to negotiate such a radical business change.
The Transformation Buy-In
To successfully deploy a digital transformation strategy, enterprise architects need to first focus on creating a roadmap to implement their key digital business strategies and the technologies required to get there. These leaders must then adopt and fully commit to the forward-thinking technologies required to digitally transform their businesses now and in the future.
To succeed in achieving digital agility, organizations should focus on three key aspects, a blend of technology and human capabilities:
1. Analytical and visualization tools that increase confidence in line-of-business (LOB) managers.
2. Self-service capabilities and the ability to scale pilot projects.
3. Cultural change management, as well as redesigned workflows and jobs.
The one most heavily invested in is the targeted analytics and visualization platforms to conduct exploratory pilots. However, beyond executive management, most LOB managers do not fully buy into the financial benefits or understand the decisions predicted by the models. This is why we still see a lot of exploratory data work that is broad-based in nature and not focused on specific use cases that create impact.
Further, after successful pilots, projects stall and get bogged down without being fully operationalized. The main reason for this challenge is that the current data platforms are IT-intensive, lacking the self-service capabilities and automation to scale from pilot to production.
Finally, there is still much skepticism among the front-line managers who lack in-depth analytics training to trust the results of these analytics and apply them to run their departments. This requires a cultural transformation with a lot of training, talent augmentation, and redesign of workflows and jobs.
Fully embracing game-changing Big Data and digital transformation initiatives for the supply chain, then, means businesses must:
* Integrate these initiatives as part of LOB objectives and metrics.
* Implement the right data fabric and integration tools with self-service capabilities, automation and industrial-strength scaling to operationalize these projects.
* Train front-line managers in functions such as customer service, sales and manufacturing to understand these initiatives, leverage digital business insights in transacting business and embrace the power of analytics.
Without the LOB leaderships full understanding and alignment, and the front line fully enabled and engaged, it is difficult for companies to derive value from their digital transformation initiatives, even if the organizational silos are eliminated and integrated data flows freely.
Digital transformation technologies can help deliver elevated business intelligence to create a level of operational efficiency across the extended supply chain previously unimaginable. Investing in the tools to support these technologies, then, can significantly reduce costs, and create extraordinary value for companies and consumers.
But for digital business transformation initiatives to begin, companies require modern, agile integration technology and strategies for deployment. For these initiatives to succeed, the humans involved and responsible for these strategies need to be able to fully participate with the technologies, have the peace of mind that the data is safe and secure, and leverage the operational insights gained.
Thus, an integrated approach enables companies to break down the organizational data silos that limit the value they can extract and the service they can offer partners, suppliers and, most importantly, customers.
Companies have been amassing data for years, yet the industry has finally reached the consensus that data for its own sake is not valuable. Now companies need to ask the critical question: Wheres the value
With todays technology and tools, data can be shared and combined in new ways, giving supply chain teams the ability to better leverage data to make smarter decisions. So, over the course of present year, how will businesses apply modern analytics technology to find value
1. Companies Will Differentiate with Standalone Analytics Offerings
As markets converge, companies will look to supply chains to differentiate with premium customer offerings.
Companies have been capturing data about sell-through, equipment performance and utilization patterns for years. In future, they will find meaningful ways to repackage and sell this data as standalone products and service offerings. By aggregating and visualizing key performance indicators (KPIs) and benchmarks, analytics will pave the way to higher margins in the form of product differentiation, customer retention and upsell opportunities.
In many of todays saturated markets, analytics will be one of the only ways to set businesses apart from competitors. Providing customers with increased transparency on the performance of what theyve purchased fosters trust, loyalty and repeat buys.
2. Established KPIs Will Focus Performance across the Enterprise
Thesupplychainis affected by business decisions that span a number of stakeholders: from supplier collaboration and purchasing to forecasting, demand planning,inventory management and fulfillment.As such, KPIs should be established to optimize performance across the enterprise rather than in a single silo.
In the past, the focus has been on maximizing departmental KPIs. With business units and acquired product lines operating as separate entities, it has been just too hard to get a unified view of the data. This limitation has created misalignment across business functions. For example, if procurement is only focused on achieving a low cost of goods, then product reliability may drop, which damages customer satisfaction.Similarly, reducing inventory as a primary KPI can lead to out-of-stocks.Instead, a balance needs to be achieved between inventory, sales and cost of goods. Over the next year, the focus will shift toward optimizing across all departments for enterprise profitability.
With todays connected supply chain, departments can work from the same data, share insights and view updates in real time. This new dynamic will evolve the linear nature of processes into a synchronized network and KPIs will adjust to reflect the change.
3. Automated Machine Learning Will Pave the Way for the Next Era ofAnalytics
Applying machine learning capabilities to the enterprise supply chain to identify trends, present recommended paths of action and automate model selection behind the scenes has thus far been out of reach. Presently, automated machine learning to select best-fit predictive models and leverage historical data to drive continuous tuning will automate the manual parts of data science to bring relevant outcomes to the business.
As automated machine learning solidifies its place in supply chain analytics, business users will be empowered to find patterns and trends, without relying on the assistance of a data analyst and the latencies involved.
With all of these changes in the analytics space, one thing is clear for future. The path from data to insight will shorten and time to value will accelerate. And for supply chain teams, in particular, there are vast opportunities beyond cost savings and on-time delivery to benefit customers, suppliers and partners.

Task of new Finance Minister : Turning the tide of public displeasure
Following the Cabinet reshuffle, Sri Lanka now has a new Minister of Finance. The reshuffle was timely, there is widespread disillusionment amongst the public who keep repeating that nothing seems to be happening. The Government now has the opportunity renew itself in the public eye, what should our new Minister of Finance do
The macroeconomic indicators are improving: government revenues are up, expenditure is stable and the fiscal deficit targets look likely to be achieved for the current year.
Growth has slowed a little to around 4-4.5% but this is only to be expected and caused by the drought and tax increases, which are also the factors that have pushed up inflation. The impact of the floods will add to these pressures but macroeconomic fundamentals are stabilising and things should improve.
Yet why is there such intense annoyance amongst the public and the business community This is partly a problem of perception and partly due to the painful measures imposed to sort out the fundamentals.
Business community
Public anger is driven by the cost of living while the business community is left bewildered by the perceived instability in the tax and policy environment. It is a tall order, but if both can be fixed he will be hailed as a success.
For the public, the problem is that the Government has achieved its macroeconomic stability at a cost: by imposing a huge tax burden on the public. Getting the macro fundamentals right is necessary and some tax increases are unavoidable but this cannot be a one-way process. The Government cannot expect to tax punitively, spend ostentatiously and expect the public to grin and bear the spectacle of ministers living in luxury while they are cutting back on staples.
The cost of living has risen sharply over the past two years because of taxes (VAT, excise duty, PAL and others) and the depreciation of the currency. Over the past two years the combined impact of VAT, PAL and the currency has added around 25% to the cost of imported items. Considering most of our basics are imported the impact on household budgets is heavy.
This is excluding the impact of any increases in duty and excise. While some duties have been cut others have risen, adding to the burden. Naturally, there is unhappiness when people have to cut back on their lifestyles; when ministers are seen to be living luxury this unhappiness morphs to real anger.
What should the minister do
The Government has no room to cut tax  yet, but they do need to send a strong message that it is serious about controlling expenditure.
It cannot be only the public who bear the burden of closing the deficit, the Government must be seen to be doing something about cutting their own expenditure. This cut back needs to be visible and lead from the top: which means no new vehicles, no fancy offices, fewer overseas jaunts, no large entourage of security/staff. It must be visible, even if the impact on cutting back on ministers privileges yields comparatively small savings, they need to be seen to be tightening their belts to win public support.
Corruption and waste
Citizens are wearied by the sight of ministers scrambling for plum positions leaving a distinct impression is that their sole interest is in feathering their own nests and enjoying the perks of office.
The minister should launch an economy drive eschewing extravagance, the elimination corruption and waste through increased transparency and open processes. Sri Lankas leaders frequently cite the example of Singapore. Fiscal prudence has been a hallmark of Singapores governing philosophy and successful management of the economy; an ethos that must become a watchword for Sri Lankas rulers.
When faced with a crisis Singapore set up a Cut Waste Panel headed by members of the public and private sector, to receive suggestions from the public on where the government can cut waste, remove frills and make savings in the delivery of public services. The minister could set up a similar panel and in addition to suggestions from the public actively seek other opportunities to reduce costs.
For example, moving to daylight saving time will save money for the CEB and reduce household electricity bills. It is a simple measure that can bring benefits at almost no cost and should be implemented immediately.
There needs to be a tightening of belts but we must all be seen to be doing it together.
In parallel, there needs to be a comprehensive review of spending, reviewing not only the scale of spending but also the scope of Government. The Government should not expend any further funds expanding the SOEs and should restructure these to cut waste and losses. Privatisation can have a threefold benefit:
a) raise revenue which will supplement tax revenues,
b) obviate the need to fund losses (in the case of loss-making entities), and
c) open new opportunities for private sector participation in the economy.
For example, plans to add 500 new outlets to the loss-making Lanka Sathosa chain at a cost of a billion rupees need to be shelved. Many SOEs serve as vehicles for patronage and are dens of corruption. Lanka Sathosa which is mired in corruption scandals (one involving a Rs.15bn consignment of rice) and has not submitted an annual report since 2012 is a prime example.
Illiberal trade policies protect businesses close to politicians and raise the cost of living. There are many such instances but to cite just one example, the import of wheat flour is taxed, ostensibly to support paddy farmers but increases the price of bread. Bread is subjected to price control  to protect the consumer but why the local price of bread is rising even while world wheat prices have collapsed by 50% since 2013 is a question that needs to be asked. Liberalising the import of wheat flour could reduce prices significantly and thus the cost of living.
There are other sectors such as dairy, (milk powder attracts a duty of Rs.225/kg, butter Rs.880/kg), fruit (oranges Rs.65/kg, grapes Rs.130.kg, apples Rs.45/kg), cooking oil (Rs.130/kg) sugar (Rs.30.kg) and meat (taxed at 30%). The cost of living can be brought down if more sectors of the economy are liberalised.
New opportunities
These are short-term measures that can bring relief to the public while the private sector will welcome the new opportunities for trade that this opens.
The governments fiscal position must sustainable over the medium and long term.
If this is not properly planned periodic fiscal crises will recur pushing the Government to resort to ad-hoc, short-term measures to deal with them creating the volatile business environment that destroys confidence.
The Prime Minister has already announced a medium-term economic framework. This, a good starting point. Budgets and policies must now fall within this framework. Policy making must be evidence based, with adequate consultation through the use Green and White papers, as in the UK.
Green Papers set out for discussion, proposals which are still at a formative stage. These detail specific issues and point out possible courses of action in terms of policy and legislation. Once an issue is debated, White Papers are issued as statements of policy, and often set out proposals for legislative changes, which may be debated further before a Bill is introduced.
The process of consultation minimises the need for later changes and results in stability in the policy environment which means business confidence will rise.
The minister has a huge task ahead of him, these are only a few preliminary ideas to explore and we wish him all success.

Tobacco cultivation to be banned by 2020

Tobacco cultivation will be banned by 2020, Health and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senaratne said today.
He said this while responding to a question by UNP MP Buddhika Pathirana in Parliament.
The Minister, observing that about 30,000 persons are currently involved in tobacco cultivation, said a programme is in place to introduce alternate crops to cultivators.
He said the sale of cigarettes within a 500 metre radius of schools will also be banned, adding that the Cabinet approved the proposal in this regard recently.
He added that the sale of single stick of cigarette would also be banned shortly, adding that this proposal also received the Cabinet approval.
Thereafter if anybody wants to buy a cigarette, he should buy a carton. Plain packing will also be introduced in the near future. All these steps are intended to discourage smoking. Sri Lanka received the accolades of the World Health Organization for strict action taken by the Government to discourage smoking, he said.
The Health Minister added that tobacco and liquor companies are not allowed to carry out Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) projects as per the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol (NATA) Act.
However, he pointed out steps to discourage liquor consumption should be initiated by the Finance Ministry, as it falls under the Finance Ministrys purview.

Young Sri Lanka must play with arrogance against India
Sri Lanka go into its crucial do-or-die game against India with a few concerns having lost its opening match versus South Africa.
Firstly, it has its stand-in captain Upul Tharanga suspended for the remaining ICC Champions Trophy group stage matches for a serious over-rate offence and, then, it also has ongoing concerns about the fitness of Angelo Mathews.
If Angelo, Sri Lankas best batsman and captain, is deemed unavailable for this vital clash, it could severely hamper the teams chances of winning against India.
Even if Angelo is considered fit, the threat of slow over-rate will be a major concern. Having Tharanga suspended is a huge waste. With quite an experienced and senior bowling attacked led by Lasith Malinga, a team constituting two spinners, it is unacceptable that Sri Lanka was over by 39 minutes.
Even though the captain is penalised more for such offences, it should be the responsibility of senior bowlers to push themselves to properly address and rectify the situation. The wicket-keeper and fielders also have to play their part with sustained urgency. Sri Lanka will take some heart with the effort of its fast bowlers, especially the performance of Nuwan Pradeep who was threatening throughout his quota of overs against South Africa.
However, the bowlers inability to strike in the first 10 overs in terms of wickets will be a concern when faced with such a strong batting line-up like India. There might be a strong case where it opts to bring in all-rounder Thisara Perera, who along with all-rounder Seekkuge Prasanna, will give them more variety and more options.
India, however, will come into the match as favourites with sky-high confidence with an almost flawless display against Pakistan. From an India perspective, the fact that Rohit Sharma and Shikar Dhawan managed to form a strong opening partnership once again was very encouraging for the defending champions given the strength of their batting combination has been vital in their past tournament successes.
The rest of their batsmen led by Virat Kohli also look in serene form and Indias batting has its normal juggernaut-feel.
Indias bowling has been a revelation in recent years in the sense that, while earlier its strength laid in the spinners it had in its ranks, right now it also has a varied and highly effective pace attack.
The Oval is a happy hunting ground for both teams and the surface on the day might make India think about bring Ravi Ashwin back into the fold.
However, it will be a pleasing selection issue to have for captain Kohli as the choices in front of him will in no way dilute their strengths. He has lots of good options. Sri Lanka will have to regroup and rethink its make-up and strategy, and take heart from the few positives from their outing against South Africa, in particular a strong fielding effort, smart execution of bowling, and the flamboyance of Niroshan Dickwella.
It will be looking as a team to execute its basics as soundly as well as it can, hoping that when coupled with its individual skill and talent, this will suffice to beat India.
I would personally like this young Sri Lanka side to walk out at The Oval and play with the arrogance and abandon of youth. They should express their talent and play a really positive brand of cricket. If they are able to do this, then they have a chance of pulling off an upset, but it will not be easy an India team that so confidently overwhelmed Pakistan on Sunday. - ICC news

Zimbabwean Ervine sends Hampshire top of the table
LONDON: Zimbabwean Sean Ervine rounded off a superb performance by taking the final two wickets to send Hampshire top of the First Division of the county championship on Monday with a crushing win over Warwickshire.
The 34-year-old -- who played five Tests for Zimbabwe and 42 One Day Internationals -- scored a sublime double century in Hampshires 515 in their only innings as they won by an innings and 94 runs.
His two wickets for the cost of just one run saw Warwickshire skittled out for 167 in their second innings with just veteran Ian Bell putting up any worthwhile resistance eking out his 99th first-class half century.
Despite rain causing a brief hiatus 34-year-old Ervine secured the final two wickets to seal victory -- making Hampshire the only county to have three wins to their tally this season.
It left the countys Australian captain George Bailey very content.
It was a fantastic win, the 34-year-old skipper told the BBC.
A great team performance. It is a great start to the season. I think the club will be really happy with that.
The only thing we spoke about this morning was about getting through Trott and Bell, then see what happens after that. If it had rained, there is not a lot we could have done.
I was proud of the way we controlled the game in the first three days.
Full credit to Jimmy Adams (he scored 166) and Sean Ervine for their phenomenal partnership. It was really hard work and they went about it their way.
