Emma Watsons Beauty and the Beast is a good start  we need more feminist fairytales
Meryl Streep called Disneys vision of passive princesses and envious stepmothers gender bigotry. Here we give some classic fairytales a reboot
For the duration of this article, we are going be using feminist as a transitive verb. You have to just not let it bother you.
Emma Watson has feministed up Beauty and the Beast, addressing the questionofwhat Belle actually does all day. We have pretty good intel on the dad, who was an inventor  and as for the Beast himself, it is a full-time job being so ugly. But, in the familiar habit of misogyny, this childrens story gives us a heroine who, for want of detail, is nothing more than a receptacle for male desire.
The amount of sheer feministing that has to be done, to unpick the centuries of careful work that have gone into smothering the female spirit, is astonishing. In fact, its quite draining to even think about. And then Emma Watson says something practical and simple, like: So, we created a backstory for [Belle], which was that she had invented a kind of washing machine, so that, instead of doing laundry, she could sit and use that time to read instead. So, yeah, we made Belle an inventor.
She makes redrawing the frame of cultural lore sound easy, but it is actually really bloody complicated. Looking at each classic in turn makes me suck my teeth like a feministing plumber at the thought of how much could go wrong.
Sleeping Beauty
Last year, the Bristol Old Vic put on a gender-reversed Sleeping Beauty, seeking to redress the innate sexism of a story in which the heroine has literally no agency, being asleep, and is nothing but the locus of male protection and rescue. (And is beautiful; important not to forget, that part. If a man accidentally rescued a woman who was only plain, imagine how boring that would be.) It worked in the sense that it was fun to watch, but at smashing the patriarchy, not so much: for the hero to function as a fragile creature whom the mere prick of a needle can floor, he had to be so ridiculous that he became a de facto anti-hero, someone whose salvation we rooted for out of convention, rather than deeply wishing for it. So the take-home was that this had been a nice try, but the sexist original  and therefore sexism itself  was the expression of some deep human truth.
For the record  and yes, Ive been thinking about this all year, now  if you wanted to feminist up Sleeping Beauty, youd have to keep her awake.
Cinderella
Cinderella, likewise, would need an overhaul more significant than could we maybe find a way to identify Cinders that doesnt rely on the glorification of small feet (Possibly the weirdest iteration of male insecurity in fairytales.) Mate-selection by aristocratic male privilege is too dodgy to gloss over; theyd have to choose each other, which takes away the whole point of the ball.
Snow White
Snow White already carries the seed of its own salvation in the fact that, following her exile, she forges an independent life that doesnt rely on a man, nor even on the search for one. It could be significantly feministed if they just dropped the whole apple/glass coffin/princely salvation thread and concentrated on having more capers with the dwarves.
Walt Disneys notorious  in Meryl Streeps memorable phrase  gender bigotry is possibly best showcased in the person of the Little Mermaid who, for the sake of a man of whom she knows nothing but his appearance (I guess it is cool that female sexuality gets a look in, but I think it was probably an accident), must relinquish her voice and her mobility. Your only hope of feministing this one up would be to make the love interest follow her into the sea. He would lose his kingdom, but materiality versus identity is rather a trivial thing. He would also have to grow gills, but he could look on that as a new skill set. He would still have his voice, though theres a question mark over whether or not he could make himself heard under water.
The real problem, running through almost all these tales, is that the events, specifically the violent events, are driven by female jealousy. It is so often a stepmother that we tend to mistakenly regard it as a comment on blood ties. In fact, the outliers  Ursula in The Little Mermaid, the uninvited fairy in Sleeping Beauty  demonstrate that the real theme is the dark and everlasting energy of a womans envy. It pleases me to picture the Brothers Grimm as an alt-right version of Beavis and Butthead, laughing their arses off at having immortalised yet another story that shows the world as the exact opposite of how it actually is. Arguably, the way to turn the canon on its head is not to approach the stories directly at all, but to create a competing narrative, a stock of stories in which fathers and stepfathers and slighted wizards attack their sons and appropriate their futures with long-range curses and elaborate vindictiveness.
In the meantime, though, Emma Watson has pulled off a subtle triumph, with a film whose trailer has now had the most views in the history of the internet. The purist might ask why the laundry was Belles job in the first place, and realistically, if she were an inventor, why she couldnt escape through ingenuity rather than waiting to fall in love. Not me. I want to stop what Im doing, go to wherever Watson is, and throw a hat or some petals at her, some flamboyantly pointless gesture of admiration.

Australia edge out France 25-23 in Paris thriller
PARIS AFP: Australia beat France 25-23 in a thrilling one-off rugby union Test in Stade de France on Saturday.
The Wallabies, who rallied from 8-0 down to lead 13-11 at half-time, held off a late French charge with Camille Lopez missing a drop goal in the last action of the match.
Michael Cheika's side, who kicked off their tour with back-to-back wins against Wales and Scotland, next play Ireland and England, as they eye a Grand Slam of Home Nations for the first time since 1984.
Both sides scored three tries apiece -- the Wallabies first a penalty try followed by one from Bernard Foley, a late call-up for the injured Quade Cooper, and a spectacular effort from Tevita Kuridrani.
It was a return to reality for France who had been aiming to build on their morale-boosting 52-8 thrashing of Samoa.
Winger Virimi Vakatawa, fly half Jean-Marc Doussain and centre Wesley Fofana scored France's tries.
France next play New Zealand in Paris on November 26 for the first time since they were humiliated 62-13 at the World Cup in 2015.

Spieth wins second Australian Open after playoff
SYDNEY: Two-time major champion Jordan Spieth won the Australian Open for the second time in three years after defeating Ashley Hall and Cameron Smith in a sudden-death playoff in Sydney on Sunday.
Spieth won at the first playoff hole with a 12-foot birdie putt on the 18th green at Royal Sydney Golf Club as Hall was unable to convert from eight feet to extend the playoff.
The world number five shot a final round three-under-par 69 to join clubhouse leaders Hall and Smith at 12-under-par, needing a par putt from seven feet on the 72nd hole to get into the playoff.
Smith -- who shot a final round 66 -- missed a 40-foot birdie putt in the playoff.
Hall, the world number 902, made eight birdies on Sunday to card a 66, but could only make par at the playoff hole.
We made the putts at the very end that mattered, American former world number one Spieth said.
I had a chance last year on 18 (to force a playoff) and didn't hit a great putt and this time I had that same chance with a very similar putt in the playoff and capitalised so I drew back on that a little.
I didn't have much confidence in my swing on the last couple of holes today in regulation and was able to calm down in-between. The 2015 US Masters and US Open champion carded six birdies and three bogeys in his final round and moved to 12-under when he holed a 40-foot birdie putt at the par-five 16th.
Spieth's victory is his first since May and comes two years after his scintillating final round 63 at The Australian Golf Club in 2014 which gave him his first Australian Open victory by six shots.
The way we played the playoff, I think it's going to do wonders for me, Spieth said. I'd been in a little bit of a stall hitting shots when they mattered. I've cut out a lot of overseas travel this year but we still came here because that's how important this event is to us. Hall and Smith both secured starts in next year's Open Championship at Royal Birkdale, while the third spot in golf's oldest major went to fellow countryman Jason Scrivener.
He finished at 10-under in a tie for fourth with Australians Rod Pampling, Aaron Baddeley and Geoff Ogilvy, and New Zealander Ryan Fox. Ogilvy -- who carried a two-shot lead into the final round -- led for most of the day and was spurred on by a chip-in eagle at the par-five seventh. But the 39-year-old's quest for a second Australian Open title fell flat with a double bogey at the par-five 16th as he slumped to a final round one-over 73. Local favourite Adam Scott started Sunday four shots off the pace but the 2013 US Masters champion fired a one-over 73 to drop into a tie for 14th at six-under. AFP

Ronaldo hat-trick downs Atletico, extends Real lead
MADRID AFP: Cristiano Ronaldo's hat-trick delivered Real Madrid's first success over Atletico Madrid in La Liga for three years with a 3-0 win in the last meeting between the sides at Atletico's Vicente Calderon.
Real now lead second-placed Barcelona by four points after the Catalans paid a heavy price for the absence of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez in a 0-0 draw with nine-man Malaga earlier on Saturday.
A third league defeat in four games leaves Atletico's title ambitions in tatters in their final season at the Calderon. Diego Simeone's men are now nine points adrift of Real down in fifth.
Ronaldo struck the decisive spot-kick as Real edged Atletico on penalties in the Champions League final in May and was the match winner once more, albeit with a slight hint of fortune.
The Portuguese's opener took a wicked deflection on its way past the excellent Jan Oblak.
Ronaldo doubled Real's lead from the penalty spot 19 minutes from time before a brilliant Gareth Bale cross teed him up for the simplest of finishes to complete his hat-trick. Real were without six key players in captain Sergio Ramos, Pepe, Casemiro, Toni Kroos, Alvaro Morata and Karim Benzema, but impressively controlled the first 45 minutes.
Only an incredible save by Oblak prevented Ronaldo opening the scoring with a towering header on 12 minutes that the Slovenian somehow clawed away low to his left.
Oblak made another smart save to deny Luka Modric moments later, but he was helpless for the opener as Ronaldo's free-kick was deflected behind him via the Atletico wall.
It took Atletico until the start of the second period to get to grips with the European champions, but came out a different side after the break.
Yannick Carrasco curled inches wide from the edge of the area before Antoine Griezmann blasted a shot across goal with no Atletico player waiting to knock to the ball into an unguarded net. AFP

No excuses for money bags Barca
BARCELONA: Barcelona defender Gerard Pique insisted the absence of Lionel Messi and Luis Suarez was no excuse for the Spanish champions dropping two vital points in a 0-0 draw with nine-man Malaga on Saturday.
Messi was ruled out just hours before kick-off due to illness, whilst the suspended Suarez looked on ruefully from the stands as an insipid Barca failed to find a way past Malagas defensive wall and the inspired Carlos Kameni in goal.
The absences are not an excuse, we are Barca, we have players worth a lot of money. We all have to perform, Pique told reporters.
Sometimes the ball doesnt want to go in, but there is nothing we can do but keep going.
A point means Barca missed the chance to leapfrog Real Madrid at the top of the table ahead of the European champions visit to local rivals Atletico Madrid later on Saturday. Kameni produced an incredible 94th minute save from Neymar after Diego Llorente had been sent-off midway through the second-half.
Juan Carlos also then saw a straight red in the sixth minute of time added on, but Malaga held out for a famous point.
Indeed, they could even have snatched all three had Carlos not hit the side-netting with the goal gaping after rounding Marc-Andre ter Stegen on the hour mark.
However, Barca boss Luis Enrique claimed he could only praise his side for a display in which they were infinitely better than the dogged visitors.
We are one of the teams most used to playing against opponents that put a lot of men behind the ball, said a visibly frustrated Enrique. But that doesnt mean that we will always overcome it. AFP

Tintin drawing sells for record 1.55m at auction

A comic strip depicting the famous boy detective Tintin has sold for a record 1.55m (1.33m; $1.64m) in Paris.
The original plate, drawn in Chinese ink, is taken from the Explorers on the Moon story by the Belgian cartoonist Georges Remi, better known as Herge.
It shows Tintin, his dog Snowy and Captain Haddock in spacesuits walking on the moon and looking at Earth.
The sale was a record for a one-page comic strip by Herge, the Artcurial auction house said.
It said that the 50x35cm drawing also set a world record for a post-war work by the artist sold at auction.
The drawing was bought by a European collector. It had been expected to fetch between 700,000-900,000 before Saturday's sale.
The 1954 book is regarded as one of Herge's masterpieces.
"It is one of the most important from Herge's postwar period, on the same level as Tintin in Tibet and The Castafiore Emerald," Artcurial's comics expert Eric Leroy said.
Tintin is one of the most recognisable comic book characters ever created.
Translated into 90 languages and selling in excess of 200 million copies, the cartoons remain popular to this day.
