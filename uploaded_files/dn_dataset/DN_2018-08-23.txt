Bangladesh eager to ink FTA with sri Lanka
Bangladesh is eagerly waiting the signing and the implementation of the FTA with Sri Lanka said Bangladesh Investment Development Authority (BIDA) Executive Chairman Kazi M. Aminul Islam.
Speaking at the Ayubowan Bangladesh forum organised by NDB Investment Bank he said that the current bilateral trade would see a major leap forward with an FTT between the two countries. Bilateral trade has been on the increase but the volumes are not so great, we can do much better with a FTA.
He also said that Sri Lankan entrepreneurs are yet to tap the investment potential in Bangladesh.
The the biggest advantage in Bangladesh is the huge market of 160 million people especially for FMCG. The growing middle class and incentives offered by the government too would be another plus point for Sri Lankan investors.
He said that there is huge unbanked population while the insurance penetration is around 1% and also the domestic LPG Gas usage is less than 5% which are all areas there is potential.
He said that though there are many foreign countries now investing in Bangladesh in large number it was Sri Lanka entrepreneurs that entered Bangladesh first and set the stage for others to follow.
He said that today with the increased exports and FDI Bangladesh will become the 28th largest economy in the world by 2030. Bangladesh received US$2.65 billion in gross inflows of FDI between July 2016 and May 2017 and exports inched up 5.81% to US$ 36.67 billion in 2017.
Laugfs Holdings Chairman W. K. H. Wegapitiya said that they currently have 9% of the Bangladesh LPG market and would be making more invests in the future to reach out to 33 million households by 2020.
LTL Group Offshore Operations General Manager Gamini Sarath, said that nearly 50% of Bangladesh population dont have access to electricity and with mega development taking place they too would be reinvesting. Though we have to get 40 approvals the process is smooth and transparent and we have invested for a third 115 MW power plant which would be operational next year.
A NDB Capital official said the Bangladesh economy is growing rapidly and in addition to the traditional apparel sector new businesses in the pharmaceuticals, ICT, maritime and tourism are emerging. (SS)

Children First, Education Next  campaign from Ceylinco Life
Over 300 Ceylinco Life policyholders and their family members were treated to a day of fun at Saniro Dream Paradise, Veyangoda, recently courtesy of the life insurance leaders Children First, Education Next campaign.
The campaign launched in February this year emphasised the importance of families spending quality timeand provided an opportunity for new policyholders who enrolled between the months of February and April to stand a chance to be invited to this signature event.
The family fun day event included an exciting draw that enabled one lucky policyholder family from Pelmadulla to win a tour to Universal Studios in Singapore. Four other families who purchased their policies from the Ceylinco Life branches at Peradeniya, Yakkala, Mahiyangana and Wellawatte won weekend packages to a Star-class hotel in Sri Lanka. This mega fun family event conceptualised, organised and funded by Ceylinco Life included magic shows, face painting opportunities, candy floss stations and surprise appearances of cartoon characters, in addition to the thrilling rides and water excursions at the park. Families who attended the event from distant locations were provided transport and accommodation.
Commenting on the event, Ceylinco Life Director and Deputy CEO Thushara Ranasinghe said, As a life insurance provider that has been protecting families in Sri Lanka for the past 30 years, Ceylinco Life believes a strong family is the core of a strong society. Noticeably, over the years, time with family has been compromised because of the undue pressure placed on children to excel at exams at any cost. This campaign ventured to address this pressing issue, and the event at Saniro Dream Paradise set the stage to bring together families for a time of togetherness and enjoyment.
The purpose of Children First, Education Next campaign was to create wider awareness of the harmful effects of parents and children being obsessed with education to the extent where the wellbeing of the children becomes secondary. The campaign which lasted two months emphasisedthe importance of giving children the time, space and freedom to think freely, spend time with family and to enjoy their precious childhood.

Mahinda Rajapaksa hoodwinking masses
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa is ignoring the 19th Constitutional Amendment. This Amendment allows a person to hold the Executive Presidency for two terms only and no more, said SLFP National Organizer and Irrigation, Water Resources and Disaster Management Minister Duminda Dissanayake.
The minister was addressing the media following a ceremony at his Anuradhapura office, recently. Minister Dissanayake said it was evident that the former President was hoodwinking the masses saying that he had the right to contest the forthcoming Presidential election, only to cover up the political reality and discrepancies in the Opposition as there was no suitable or acceptable contestant to compete at the elections.
His other objective is to divert the attention of the people to hide the chaotic situation within his group, he said.
Neither I nor former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga is thinking of a political tying up of the UNP and SLFP. We shall never allow the SLFP to come under the command of Mahinda Rajapaksa again, he added.
It is natural when two major political parties enter into an alliance that numerous problems arise. It does not mean that we cease our mutual agreement and break away. We, the national government, are stable and determined to move forward together strongly and energetically, the SLFP National Organizer added.
He said the law of the country was equal to all. Earlier, there was a barrier to inquire into the decisions taken by an Executive President.
It can be recalled that during the Rajapaksa regime, former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga was forced to appear before the law. As such, it is my view that questioning the former President by the FCID was correct in terms of the law, especially in consideration of the statement given by Speaker Karu Jayasooriya in relation to journalist Keith Noyahr.
There should be a law where even the Executive President is not permitted to surpass the law of the country, the minister said.

Australia secures lease for first floating import ship
The details around Australias first floating liquefied natural gas import ship were finalized on Monday, with Australian Industrial Energy securing a vessel from Norwegian firm Hoegh LNG.
The move comes just months after the state and federal government fast-tracked a $250 million plan to develop an import terminal at Port Kembla, 100 kilometers south of Sydney, in order to shore up the east coasts wavering gas supplies.
Securing the Floating Storage and Regasification Unit, and confirmation of the New South Wales governments planning requirements are two further important milestones for our project, AIE CEO James Baulderstone said. We remain on target to deliver gas to our industrial customers during early 2020 and our schedule coincides with the expected significant tightening of the east coast gas supply market, especially for major industrial users, he said.
The 300-meter-long LNG ship will operate in Port Kembla Harbour and is expected to bring in around 1.8 million metric tons of LNG per year.
The technologies involved in the FSRU to be docked at Port Kembla will include the latest safety and environmentally sustainable solutions available on the global market, Hoegh LNG CEO Sveinung J.S. Stohle said.
We are impressed with the AIE consortiums capabilities and its vision to address the gas supply challenges that the Australian east coast market is facing, particularly in NSW, Stohle said.

Awaiting the Million dollar verdict!
Three and a half years after he was ousted from power, former President Mahinda Rajapaksa was the focus of attention last week. Although some of the reasons for the publicity Rajapaksa generated may not have been to his liking, other events may have reignited presidential ambitions for the countrys fifth Executive President.
Rajapaksa hit the headlines when officers of the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) recorded a statement from him last Friday regarding the abduction and assault of the then Deputy Editor of The Nation, Keith Noyahr.
Noyahr was abducted and assaulted on May 22, 2008 in Dehiwala. In the hours after his abduction, Karu Jayasuriya, who was the Minister of Public Administration and Home Affairs in the Rajapaksa led government, was alerted by Noyahrs colleagues. Jayasuriya telephoned Rajapaksa to inform him. Hours later Noyahr was released by his abductors, battered and bruised but alive to tell the tale.
Noyahr has since left the country and is now domiciled in Australia. However, investigators have pieced together the jigsaw relating to his disappearance and visited Australia to interview the journalist. Several army personnel including former Military Intelligence Director and Chief of Staff of the Army, Major General (Retired) Amal Karunasekara are in remand custody over Noyahrs abduction and assault.
Previously, investigators had recorded Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas statement regarding his intervention. The interview with Rajapaksa was a natural follow-up on that. The CID forwarded Rajapaksas statement to the Mount Lavinia Magistrates Court on Monday.
Politicised investigation
Although Rajapaksa was extended the courtesies befitting a former President with the CID visiting him at his official residence rather than vice versa and was informed at the outset that he was not being treated as a suspect, he chose to politicise the investigation. Emerging from the interview he claimed that the government was engaged in a political witch-hunt against him.
The CID must have been instigated by government leaders to record my statement. The government is trying to achieve its political ends. This is an event which shows that the government is vindictive, Rajapaksa alleged. Rajapaksa, who rarely loses his composure, was rattled enough to lash out at his private secretary Udith Lokubandara, for bringing him to face the media after the CID interview.
As for the interview itself, Rajapaksa said he had told the CID that he could not recollect Jayasuriyas telephone call as it happened over ten years ago and also because many ministers call him from time to time. Former minister G. L. Peiris and former Chief Justice Sarath Silva were with Rajapaksa during the interview.
If Rajapaksa was unhappy at this turn of events, another development has led to a glimmer of hope within the ranks of the Joint Opposition (JO). That comes in the form of legal opinion that he is not debarred from contesting the Presidency for a third time.
The popular perception was that the introduction of the 19th Amendment to the Constitution prevented Rajapaksa from running for President again. That is because Section 4 of the 19th Amendment decreed that no person who has been twice elected to the office of President by the people, shall be qualified thereafter to be elected to such office by the people. This section amended Article 31 of the Constitution.
It will be recalled that the Constitution, when it was first introduced in 1978 did have a disqualification imposed on individuals who had held the office for two terms. However, this was repealed through the 18th Amendment passed by a two-thirds majority in Parliament when Rajapaksa was President. It was widely acknowledged that it was a move to facilitate Rajapaksa running for President a third time, which he did in 2015 and lost.
There is no dispute that the 19th Amendment bars individuals from assuming office more than twice. However, some legal experts are of the opinion that the amendment is prospective and cannot be applied retrospectively which means that the two-term limit applies only after 2015, when the 19th Amendment was introduced.
Although that does not appear to be the spirit of the 19th Amendment, there does appear to be some room for debate on this issue. That is because Section 4 of 19th Amendment, which restores the two-term limit, does not specify the date from which it is applicable.
High office
However, with regard to the entire 19th Amendment, Section 1(2) of the 19th Amendment states that: The provisions of this Act other than the provisions of section 9 (in so far it relates to paragraph [1] of Article 46 of the Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka) and the provisions of section 15 shall come into force on the date on which this Act comes into operation.
Since the 19th Amendment was certified into law on May 15, 2015, some legal experts contend that the two-term limit would not apply to Rajapaksa as well as the only other ex-President, Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga. Kumaratunga, of course, is not interested in running again for high office.
Among the legal experts reportedly supporting this view are former Chief Justice Sarath Silva and former Justice Minister and Professor of Law, G. L. Peiris who is also the nominal head of the Sri Lanka Podujana Party (SLPP). Supporting this view in the media was Dr. Nihal Jayawickrama, the controversial former Secretary to the Ministry of Justice in Sirima Bandaranaikes 1970-77 government.
Peiris was to announce on Monday that the SLPP would soon move the District Court on this issue. Peiris expects that court to then refer the matter to the Supreme Court. When this plan was first suggested to Rajapaksa, he had been dismissive of the idea saying he had no appetite to canvass the issue in courts. However, it has been pointed that any citizen could file a fundamental rights application in the Supreme Court which would then be required to provide an interpretation of the Constitution.
However, others such as Higher Education and Cultural Affairs Minister Dr Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe have maintained that only the President could consult the Supreme Court. Other such as United National Party (UNP) parliamentarian Thushara Indunil have noted that the Supreme Court recently decided that President Maithripala Sirisenas term of office was five years- though that too was a measure introduced in the 19th Amendment.
Next presidential election
The political implications of this issue are immense. That the JO has inquired into this issue and has arrived at this conclusion is indicative of the dilemma they face in finding a candidate for the 2020 presidential election. Although Gotabhaya Rajapaksa is the frontrunner among potential JO nominees, it was no secret that there is also significant opposition to his candidature, with the likes of Vasudeva Nanayakkara and Kumar Welgama speaking out against it publicly.
Gotabhaya Rajapaksa himself has other hurdles to overcome. He remains a United States citizen and it is unclear whether he could renounce it within a short period of time. There are also many court cases where his role has come under scrutiny. In that sense, there is a school of thought within the JO that while Gotabhaya Rajapaksa had arguably the highest profile apart from Mahinda Rajapaksa, his candidacy also had the highest element of risk.
In such circumstances, if Mahinda Rajapaksa could contest again, that would be ideal for the JO. Clearly, Rajapaksa is the most marketable opposition politician in the country. However, in trying to pursue legal avenues to assess whether Rajapaksa can run for President again, the JO and the SLPP are also playing with a double-edged sword: if the campaign to re-instate Mahinda Rajapaksa as candidate fails in court, the JO would be losing valuable time and resources in promoting the eventual candidate.
For that reason, it is likely that the JO will move to have the matter scrutinised by the Supreme Court sooner rather than later. It will be a verdict that will, for obvious reasons, shape the nature and perhaps the outcome of the next presidential election.

Black Tot Day at GFH
Black Tot Day commemorates July 31, 1970 and is the name given to the last day on which the British Royal Navy issued sailors with a daily rum ration.
After the Battle of Trafalgar, daily rum rations (also called a tot) were instigated where they gave sailors half a pint of navy proof rum 78 per cent ABV, which they downed and got back to work. The practice was abolished in 1970 after concerns that regular intakes of alcohol would disrupt sailors efficiency and lead to unsteady hands when operating machinery.
To celebrate the 48th anniversary of Black Tot Day, the Galle Face Hotel held a rum tasting at the Verandah. Guests were treated to a historical overview before tasting a wide variety of rum on offer at the hotel, along with an unlimited supply of canaps.
The Galle Face hotel is steeped in rich history and culture dating back to the colonial times. Similarly, Black Tot Day has a strong sense of heritage going back 300 years and we want to revive and celebrate these threads of history in a fun, modern way, Galle Face Hotel, General Manager, Robert Hauck said.
The hotel provided the finest of rums for guests to sip on while harking back to the glorious days of the past and enjoying the present day with picturesque views of the Indian Ocean.

Choose to say no!
I am writing with regard to the increasingly acute problem of drug abuse among teenagers in Sri Lanka. That the number of young drug abusers continues to climb in the territory is terribly worrying. Not only there are more teenagers becoming addicted to drugs being abused, and it is now even easier for teenagers to get hold of drugs. Society, including young people themselves needs to urgently address this challenge, and create a better future for young people.
First and foremost, with a sizable amount of resources of disposal, the government should allocate more of its resources to deal with the issue. Special training should be given to social workers as well as teachers in order to equip them with sufficient knowledge about drugs and drug abuse and to up-skill these professionals to enable them to better deal with teenage drug abusers. Through training, the social workers and teachers would be aware of the latest development in the field of drug abuse such as the drugs currently being used and the trends in cross-border drug dealing. Without such knowledge, social workers and teachers cannot solve the problem.
At the same time, the schools, with the aid of social workers, ought to promote the anti-drug awareness. Talks and seminars should be held to teach a youngster about the effects of drug abuse, such as the damage to their kidneys, heart and brain. Students should also be warned not to become involved in drug-related crimes, for example selling drugs, as they will end up with criminal records which will not be able to be erased. Without doubt, the anti-drug message in school must be clear and strong enough to prevent a student from experimenting with drugs.
Family members, especially parents have to show concern for their children and be aware of any signs of them using drugs. Although these three parties, the government, schools, and family members have obligations to solve the problem of drug abuse. Teenagers, themselves have a strong responsibility to say no to drugs and lead drug-free lives. Drug addiction will not only damage their health but also affect the kind of job they can get and the family life they can enjoy in the future.
Moreover, teenagers have a responsibility to their peer. These peers are their friends, and out of concern for the health and future happiness of their friends, they not only should distance themselves from drugs but also help their peers to do the same.

Dependent political culture must change - Eran
State Finance Minister Eran Wickremaratne said the tradition of running behind politicians for government jobs should change.
He said the Government has already taken the lead in driving this change in mindset to enable Sri Lankan youth to be self-reliant by introducing programmes like Enterprise Sri Lanka.
This happens only in Sri Lanka. A dependent political culture like this had been created by leaders who ruled the country during the past 70 years. But we are not ready to continue this, he said.
Wickremaratne further stressed the importance of giving due respect for entrepreneurs as in the case of professionals.
He said that the government had taken a number of measures to assist Sri Lankan youth to be entrepreneurs.
A large number of low interest and interest free loan schemes such as Govi Navodaya and Riya Shakthi have been introduced by the government.
Under the Enterprise Sri Lanka programme entrepreneurs have been able to obtain low interest loans from Rs 50,000 to Rs 75 million.
Today, we have 230,000 entrepreneurs in Sri Lanka and they account for 2.8% of the total workforce. In Vietnam you have 19.6% and in Thailand there are 28.5% entrepreneurs. But larger countries such as Bangladesh there are 11.6% and China has 7.5% entrepreneurs. We need to encourage entrepreneurship, he added.
The State Minister said that the government has also implemented Gamperaliya, massive development drive to enhance rural infrastructure facilities to uplift the rural economy of the country.

Digitalization key to changing HR perspective
Digitalization has played a vital role in changing the HR perspective of the country and due to the impact of digitalization and technology has replaced with certain jobs that were handled by humans before, said CEO  IPM, P. G. Tennakoon,
Also, with the improved educational level of the younger generations especially of the Millennials and the generation Z, scarcity of labour to function certain blue collar jobs can be seen and it has improved to a level that we have to import labour from other countries.
Further, with the popularity of flexi working arrangements such as telecommuting and free-lance work and consulting work, attracting skilled labour for organizations has become challenging, added Tennakoon.
Commenting on the importance of teamwork in an HR operation and that of a company he said that an organization is defined as a collection of two or more people working for a common objective.
In this context, from the definition itself it is implied that leaders in organizations need to drive their teams for a common objective.Therefore, the role of teamwork is an inherent requirement for any organization to achieve results. From the HR operations perspective, the synergetic advantages that we can gain through teamwork can play wonders in achieving results.
The uniqueness that we can see in human beings are the skill differences that we can see in each individual eg. some individuals have born with more Creative skills while the analytical skills for certain others. Therefore, the alignment of different skills is vital for organizations to achieve different set of goals and this alignment can be made through team work.
Content theories of motivation explain the specific factors that motivate behaviour of human being. In this context reward and recognition are two key motivators which has a direct correlation with individual productivity. Through the reward and recognition employees can be stimulated to achieve better results.
Incentive schemes and various recognition schemes can be designed as stimuli to increase productivity of individuals. When theres some stimuli, employees will naturally tend to adjust their behaviour to acquire the intended benefit which will then be indirectly benefitting in achieving required productivity levels.
HR best Practices
Asked to comment on the improvements in HR best Practices he said that due to the dynamic global trends that is emergingmainly due to thechanges in the macro economic factors, the importance and the value of human being have been identified as a critical factor of production. In a such a context today organizations have taken measures to improve the HR practices within the organizations in order to ensure the retention of skilled labour force. In this endeavour, the organizations practice to benchmark the organizations with other comparable organizations to understand the standards of internal HR practices. Therefore, undoubtedly we can admit that there an improvement in HR best practices today in any organization.
Performance based promotions have been identified as one of the HR best practices in the corporate world. In todays context where we have given a prominent place for good governance, granting promotions using personal influences and other unethical ways are considered as a bad HR practices and organizations are trying to become more transparent in awarding promotions.
From the employees perspective as well, maintaining a transparent promotion scheme has become one of the expectations and it will lead to improve level of motivation and productivity of employees.
Advice to youth pursuing a career in HR
My advice for budding HR professionals is to have a greater passion and be excel in whatever you do and contribute something to the society through effective contribution of your knowledge, skills and attitude while maintaining your personal values and professional ethics.
Also be a multi skill person to accept any responsibilities and challenges go up in the ladder for career aspiration and successful person.

EIAs for all Government policies, plans - CEA
The Central Environmental Authority (CEA) has proposed to apply the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) to Government policies and plans.
CEA Deputy Director General (Environmental Management and Assessment) Kanthi De Silva said the CEA can make more effective intervention if the EIA is necessitated at the policy and planning level of various projects.
She was speaking at a workshop for media personnel in Biyagama on Tuesday. CEA Chairman Chandraratne Pallegama said there had been instances where Cabinet approval had been granted for various projects prior to EIA clearance.
He said the CEA often comes under criticism when it fails the EIA of projects that had been approved by Cabinet. Then we get the blame that we try to obstruct vital projects of the Government. The correct procedure is that the Cabinet approval must be given only after the EIA is passed. We have communicated this problem to the Government. As a solution, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had agreed to allow the CEA to bring in amendments to relevant legislation when taken up for the second reading. It was also agreed that the Cabinet will look into the recommendations of the CEA when such projects are given the green light, he explained.
He pointed out that the recent Cabinet decision on palm oil cultivation also run into a controversy as CEA opinion was ignored.
Pallegama said the damage palm oil cultivation causes is greater than its benefits. Kanthi De Silva said the CEA came up with the proposal to conduct the EIA at the policy and planning level as the CEA finds it difficult to control the possible environmental issues when those came to the project level.

Empowering Jaffna youth
Due to the 30 year civil war the youth lost their innocence and their physical infrastructure. They lost so many educational opportunities and skill development. They also lost their dreams. The Daily News speaks to National Director of SOS Childrens Villages Sri Lanka, Divakar Ratnadurai on how SOS is helping the youth of Jaffna to reclaim the rights any human being is entitled to at birth.
SOS Childrens villages in a nutshell is an organization that helps children in need and children who need parental care and children who are at the risk of losing parental care. The new addition to the priority list of SOS is the Vocational Training Centre in Jaffna. After the war we built a village in Jaffna. Through this we found out that these youth need proper employment so they can have an income to support their families, be self- sufficient and their home economies will flourish, said Ratnadurai.
Divakar Ratnadurai
Ratnadurai pointed out some of the Jaffna youth are highly qualified but during an interview they cannot answer in English and they want to do it in the local language.
We did a survey to assess the needs in Jaffna. So we did this very good survey concerning employment. We found that there is a need for training in English, then there is also a need for training in Information and Communications technology, there is a demand for beauty culture trainers and Air condition making and fridge making technicians, said Ratnadurai.
SOS got into action after receiving the results of this survey. So they began building the vocational training center in Jaffna.
We decided to cater to 60 students and now we have sixty students in these four courses and now for the four courses we have full capacity. And they are accredited to National Vocational Qualification (NVQ) Level 3. We dont go for NVQ level 4 or 5. As soon as you do that you lose the target. NVQ Level 3 is the equivalent of an O/L pass. We are concentrating on NVQ level 3 because most of the youth who come for these courses have either not got through their O/L or they are from very poor families. The criteria for selection is they need to be below the poverty line and have been unable to continue their education, explained Ratnadurai.
The government has recognized NVQ Level 3 as O/L pass. NVQ Level 4 is A/L pass. Once they finish this course of NVQ level 3 certain organizations have come forward to support them for on the job training.
So we want to take this youngsters out of Jaffna so they can get exposure outside. They will be sent for on the job training. But for English and ICT it will be a little difficult. For Air Conditioning and Fridge making there are some companies that have come to help these youngsters. They will be given an allowance. For six months they will be given on the job training. They will come back and do the assessment test. And then they will get the certificate. Once they get the certificates they will be taken for employment. Our plan is to monitor them for three years. This is to make sure they are steady and they dont fall back, pointed out Ratnadurai.
Ratnadurai commented that they are also thinking about self- employment for these youngsters. But this is still being considered. For air conditioning and beauty culture training they will go for on the job training and thereafter they will go for jobs.
I personally think that for beauty culture they will not go for jobs. They will get the training and then start something of their own. There is a high demand for beauty culture in Jaffna with weddings and dressing ups. Because they have to bring people down from Colombo. So these youth have a very good chance, because casually when I was talking to these girls they said they want a good experience and start their own businesses. There are not many saloons in Jaffna so they have to get their experience in Anuradhapura and Colombo. Colombo is actually better. So this is the plan for the vocational training center. We actually opened it in March. The first course will be over in October or November. We dont want to select youth with funds. We want to select youth under the poverty line. So they can benefit from this and their family becomes stronger, added Ratnadurai.
The aim of SOS Sri Lanka is to be self-sufficient by 2023. So there are challenges in store for SOS Sri Lanka. But there is a lot of support from the people of Sri Lanka. Jaffna is the fourth vocational training center in Sri Lanka. The first one was in Anuradhapura. Moneragala is the largest one.
The reason we started these vocational training centers is not only to support the youngsters in the area but also the children who have lost parental care. If they are living in a home then they have they fulfill the first requirement to enter a vocational training center. Because we know they need support. There a lot of problems youngsters face when they dont have their parents, said Ratnadurai.
The Vocational Training Authority in Sri Lanka are the people who can give these levels. Once you register with them, they give all the syllabus. NVQ Level 7 is equal to a degree.
We have NVQ 3 which is the basic so they can be employed. Our main vision is to give them employment so they have money in their hands and they have proper employment and proper qualification, said Ratnadurai.
The idea is to make this sustainable to these youngsters do not need to depend on others. All this is given free of charge. It is all free and the response is great. So this is a learning experience for all involved. All that is required is dedication, discipline and desire from these youngsters. If they are committed they can do very well. They just need to be focused. Their destiny is in their hands. They can choose to succeed or fail. SOS wants the best for these youngsters.

Protect children today and tomorrow will fall in place:
Every minute counts!
At the outset, I congratulate AYAVEC, a collective of seven volunteer youth organisations that has been campaigning against child abuse in Sri Lanka. This group has set an example for others by carrying out an island-wide door to door campaign raising awareness and amassing public support for child rights. Recently they presented a petition consisting of 100,000 signatures to the Minister of Women and Child Affairs with a concrete proposal to fight against child abuse in the country. This is commendable. We need more of such socially responsible youth organisations across the globe that can stand in support of the most vulnerable and marginalized children who cant speak for them-selves.
For some, children are the future; for me, they are the present - the reality which we live in. How we treat them now will shape the tomorrow of our society, our country and the larger world. In fact the world has come a long way realizing this. Due to collaborative efforts of governments, international organisations, civil society and the private sector, the number of child labourers over the last 15 years has fallen from 260 million to 152 million. The number of out of schoolchildren has also fallen from 130 million to 60 million. While these statistics are seemingly encouraging, we must not forget that 73 million children are still trapped in slavery, trafficking, sexual exploitation, armed conflict and are subjected to unabated violence.
Sri Lanka has shown exemplary resilience in the face of the 27-year-old civil war that ended in 2009 and is heading towards becoming a competitive knowledge based economy. This will be possible only when all children of the country are taken along, nurtured well and their free, safe, healthy and educated childhood is ensured. According to the child activity survey conducted in 2015/2016, number of child labour has reduced by 60% in Sri Lanka as compared to the previous survey conducted seven years ago-- a fact which perfectly corroborates that Sri Lanka is one of those progressive nations that has increased the age of compulsory education from 14 to 16 years. In doing so, Sri Lanka has increased the budgetary allocation for education nearly by four times. The countrys commitment towards ensuring education of its children will go a long way in building a stronger, inclusive and productive nation.
National Policy of Elimination of Child Labour in Sri Lanka
The work doesnt end here. We have a lot of ground to cover. According to the National Policy of Elimination of Child Labour in Sri Lanka (2017) there are around 100,000 child labourers out of which almost 40,000 are in undeniably worst forms.
There are reports of children from tea estates being trafficked internally to perform domestic work in Colombo; their payments are withheld and their movements are restricted. They have been reduced to slaves. Children, predominantly boys, are also forced into commercial sexual exploitation in coastal areas as part of the sex tourism industry.
A high number of cases of sexual abuse, commercial sexual exploitation of children, child prostitution and online child sexual exploitation and abuse, including child pornography have also been reported in Sri Lanka. In a civilized world even a single child in such danger, trapped in slavery and violence is one too many. Emancipation of these children is a social emergency that cannot be procrastinated. These children cannot afford to wait.
I am in Colombo on August 28 and 29 for the 2nd Asia Meet of my initiative Parliamentarians without Borders for Childrens Rights where lawmakers from several Asian countries will discuss tangible ways of protecting the rights of such vulnerable children.
While the world stands committed to the UNs Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), in my opinion, none of these goals can be accomplished by 2030 until and unless the world invests enough in its children.
It is imperative for governments to step up their individual and collective efforts to eliminate modern slavery, trafficking and child labour. Equally important it is to accelerate peace building and financing efforts fostering a child friendly world. Just about 40 billion USD is required to ensure that every child in this world gets access to education. This is barely one week of global military expenditure. Is the world so poor that it cannot foot its childrens education bill I refuse to accept this. Governments must adequately invest in education, health, nutrition and achievement of all international children related commitments including the SDGs particularly no. 8.7; 4.7; 5.2; 5.3 and 16.2 among others.
The day and age of Information Technology that we live in is marred with precariousness of children falling prey to child pornography and sexual abuse. While it is important to impart training to children and youth for responsible usage of the internet, it has become more important than ever to have a legally binding global convention against online child sexual abuse backed by a dedicated Global Task Force.
Human traffickers
Human trafficking is an organised crime that ranks globally third after illicit arms and drugs. It generates over 150 billion USD of black money every year world over. Elements of force, compulsion, deceit, coercion, temptation and false promises are common denominators in trafficking of innocent children. Huge syndicates have their skin in this game. Therefore there is an emergent need for the national police and Interpol to coordinate their efforts to combat this crime by systematically dismantling its complex modus operandi. Governments have to crack the whip on human traffickers and bring them to books.
Businesses must pay their fair share of tax in time to help enable governments discharge their duties effectively. Further businesses must also ensure that their supply chains that span across the informal segment of the economy particularly in the developing world are free of human rights violations like forced labour, slavery and child labour. The international community must fulfil its promises on aid and assistance, particularly for education.
Strengthened, coordinated, and holistic inter-ministerial and inter-departmental initiatives for the protection of child rights remain at the core of the fight to end violence against children. The rate of prosecution and conviction in the child rights violation cases world over continue to be abysmally low. Governments, judiciary and international organisations must do everything it takes to ensure that timely justice is delivered in cases of crimes against children serving as a tough deterrent.
One of the beacons of hope for Sri Lanka in expediting its interventions to end violence against children is the youth of the country. Sri Lanka is young. Close to a quarter of its population is estimated to be youths between the ages of 15 and 29. Almost 98% of these youths are literate. This is a very big dividend any nation can possibly have. It kindles a ray of hope for the vulnerable and marginalized children. The youth can lead from the front in freeing children from exploitation and ensuring that they are educated in good quality schools. Youth can become champions of child rights asking the Government to shape national and international development policies, programmes and financing keeping in mind the very last child in need.
Children in dire need of care and protection; children who are trapped in slavery; children who are in difficult situations; children who are facing violence cannot wait and so cant we. We cannot afford to fail our children; we cannot afford to fail a whole generation. Come what may, we have to protect all children, because each day lost in the life of a helpless and vulnerable child is irrecoverable. The sooner we put our act together and protect our children the better would be our prospects for a brighter tomorrow!

What inspired you to come back to your home country and work at Riu Sri Lanka

Ive been spending most of my life abroad and wasnt quite aware of the post-war situation in Sri Lanka. Even if I have had the idea of coming back it certainly wouldnt have been for my career. But all these thoughts surprisingly changed overnight as Riu was planning to enter Sri Lanka for its first ever all-inclusive resort in the Asian region. Prior to my assignment here, I was based in the hotels Mauritius property since its pre-opening.

Experts highlights need for continued collaboration for startups to succeed
The 2018 edition of Disrupt Asia, Sri Lankas Premier Start-up Conference and Innovation Festival, was successfully concluded recently at the Trace  Expert City with the participation of a large number of individuals connected to the growing startup industry in Sri Lanka.
The Conference part of Disrupt Asia 2018 featured several top international and local experts in entrepreneurship, policy, innovation and startups while the Innovation Festival, a newaddition to this years event, showcased many technological innovations that included works of art and digital activations for the public to experience and interact with.
The Conference brought to light the need for policy and strategy while entrepreneurs shared their insights, successes and failures and inspired current and potential entrepreneurs. Several top experts from USA, Netherlands, UK, Singapore, Bangladesh, Philippines, India and Sri Lanka expressed their views on AI, digital marketing, security and set the stage for disruptive thinking around STEAM education, creative industries and social entrepreneurship.
One of the key objectives of Disrupt Asia bringing down foreign experts was to get them to inspire local entrepreneurs through their startup experiences back home. Several of the international speakers who took part in the event continued to engage with local entrepreneurs in the days following the event and offered valuable insights on how Sri Lankan startups could succeed locally and globally. These newly-formed relationships are expected to greatly help local entrepreneurs to think big and elevate their startups to the next level.
During his Opening Keynote, Glenn Robinson - Managing Director of XLr8 Andhra Pradesh Technology Business Accelerator (University of Texas at Austin extension) emphasized on several keys to innovation economies and explained the need to exploit local advantages, develop and diffuse innovation expertise, encouraging self determination and accelerate through collaboration between educational institutes, private sector organisations and the government and the importance of inclusiveness. He further envisioned let electrons be shared, but insure atoms collide and engage in a virtuous cycle.
At the Strategy and Policy panel discussion, a common notion among the audience was that all the support given to startups need to be communicated efficiently in a startup friendly manner using the proper channels. The government promised to provide their fullest support to these companies and in turn requested them to continuously engage with them and keep them accountable. In short, the consensus was that the government, private sector and the general public need to communicate and collaborate better in order to reap the maximum benefits of the startup economy.
In the panel discussion on the topic Myth busting Social Entrepreneurship, the experts addressed the myth that social enterprises cannot earn a profit. They elaborated on how social enterprises can be profitable whilst also ensuring that all employees receive a fair salary, raw material is acquired from sustainable sources, manufacturing and packaging is environmentally-friendly and the product or service creates a positive impact on society. They stated that a significant portion of the profits of social enterprises need to be reinvested in the company in order to grow the company while also uplifting the lives of employees and subcontractors. One of the key highlights during the discussion was the emphasis on responsible uses of technology when it comes to disruption.
During his Closing Keynote, Nick Marino Junior - Director of Social Change at Tango Tab challenged the audience to go out there and make a difference in the world through their start-ups. He stressed on the need to bring ideas to life quickly and encouraged the audience to take action swfitly to stay ahead of the competition in a fast-paced world.
Organized by the Information and Communication Technology Agency of Sri Lanka (ICTA), Disrupt Asia 2018 is supported by the Ministry of Telecommunication, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment. The event was supported by numerous partners connected to the startup ecosystem while the Inclusion Partner - LIRNEasia and Social Innovation Partner - UNDP Sri Lanka are continuing to work closely with the ICTA on several ongoing projects.

Fake news adds to Indias flood torment
INDIA: Cristiano Ronaldo has not donated $11 million to the Kerala flood disaster fund and there are no cracks in a key dam, but Indias fake news machine has been working overtime to fuel confusion and fear.
The Kerala state government and Indias military have issued rare warnings about viral social media messages as they confront the aftermath of floods which have killed some 420 people.
The deluge of false news, videos and claims also comes as the Indian government steps up pressure on Facebook, WhatsApp and other platforms to act against fake news, blamed for inciting more than 20 lynchings in the past two months.
Some postings have been relatively harmless. Portuguese football superstar Ronaldo is often linked to big donations after a catastrophe that makes international headlines.
But Indian fact-checking websites like Boomlive.in have highlighted how many people are using Ronaldos supposed donation to criticise the federal governments response to the crisis.
The central government has pledged almost $100 million in aid so far.
Kerala Chief Minister Pinarayi Vijaran issued a Twitter warning after a viral fake video said there were cracks in the Mullaperiyar dam in Keralas Idukki district.
In the clip an unidentified man, quoting a supposed friend in the office of Prime Minister Narendra Modi, says that within three hours the surrounding area will be inundated.
I wish to inform all that the state government will now take very strict action against such people, Vijayan said.
The Indian Army in turn debunked a fake video where a man in military fatigues is seen talking about the relief operations and slamming the Kerala chief minister.
Imposter wearing army combat uniform in video spreading disinformation about rescue and relief efforts, the army tweeted.
Every effort (being made) by all and Indian army to overcome this terrifying human tragedy, it said, urging people to inform authorities about suspicious news.
Joke news peddled by parody accounts on Twitter have also caused distress.
Man refuses to accept a saffron life jacket, dies as a result, read a headline on a story by Fault News which describes itself as a satirical portal.
Saffron is the most sacred colour for Hindus. They are the majority in Kerala, a state of 33 million people, and there is rivalry with Christian and Muslim communities.
In yet another instance, an image of a flooded car park at a Renault dealership in the main city of Kochi turned out to be an old photo.
Fake news is often deadly in India. Hoax messages about child kidnappers being seen in villages spread like wildfire on platforms such as WhatsApp, which boasts more than 200 million users in India.
Mobs quickly gather to target the alleged intruders. More than 20 innocent people have been killed across India since June.
Facebook is investigating intensively to counter fake news in India and other countries, hiring teams to track content and linking with fact-checking groups, its officials say.
The Indian government demanded that Facebook-owned WhatsApp clamp down on fake news in talks this week with its chief executive Chris Daniels.
Information Technology Minister Ravi Shankar Prasad said he was assured that WhatsApp will soon take steps to comply with the demands. - AFP

Fish exports to Europe increase by 125 percent
The latest reports regarding Sri Lanka's fish exports reveal that the exports in 2017 to EU countries had increased by 125 percent last year.
Compared to 2016, fish exports to EU countries in 2017 indicate an increase of 41.8 percent and the foreign exchange had enhanced by 48.5 percent, according to the statistics of the Fisheries and Aquatic Resource Development Ministry and the Central Bank.
Such a rapid increase was achieved after the ban on fish exports imposed on Sri Lanka by the EU was lifted in 2016. Statistics further showed that between July 2016 to March 2018, a total of 28,578.09 metric tons of fish had been exported to EU countries and the foreign exchange earned was Rs. 92,117 million.
In 2014, the export of fish was limited to 26,320 MT and this went down to 26,129 MT during the ban on fish exports with effect from January 2015 to June 2016 - nearly 18 months. The foreign exchange earned was confined to Rs. 2,103 million.
This year, within a three-month period, fish exports amounted to 7,174.8 MT, enabling the government to earn an income of Rs. 11,804.4 million as foreign exchange.

## Title: Freeing a society shackled to reliance

Freeing a society shackled to reliance
Sri Lanka, similar to many other counties, had been titled a 'developing country'. It seems ridiculous as the whole world, including developed countries, are constantly developing. However, a negative connotation was given to our rate of development and worse, belittled by the adjective 'third world'.
Interdependent social structures
The phrasing of statements evolves with our understanding of society. We replace deformed with differently-abled, though the physical nature remains the same. Religious tolerance is a replacement for religious acceptance, yet the conflict of interests prevails. Then, what of the developing country instead of colony This last example is far-fetched and contrived. If examined with the eye of reason, the colony and third world are interdependent social structures.
This has an ultimate relationship with social sciences. The third world sphere of the globe relies heavily on financial sponsorship of first world institutions. Such a situation is akin to a colony where the coloniser finances the inveterate polity. What we paid in tax earlier, is now converted into an interest premium.
The colonisers investment had transformed into a bank loan granted by first world institutions. Notably, the third world claimed its sovereignty, owing to the right of making decisions, especially on development. Ironically, that was subjected to first world sanctions. Developing countries must bypass a western approval-based process. These countries are baptised in the name of sovereignty, though not at all independent.
Modern concepts of globalisation and neoliberalism had raised the first world into a higher pedestal, making the third world reliant. This predicament, which the third world is compelled to endure along with manipulation, affects the equilibrium of the global order.
Evolution of civilisations
A civilisation is a state of development where culture or cultures within a set boundary have an economy. This evolves scientifically. Ceylon, as a colony, was an extension of the British civilisation. Its development was directly proportional to approvals made by the Crown. By acquiring Independence, the Ceylonese were unshackled from foreign intervention. This point is debatable.
By the time the British left, they had already signed and grouped the Ceylonese into the Bretton Woods system and the United Nations. This deprived the Ceylonese of any opportunity to discuss terms that would benefit their indigenous lifestyle. In fact, Independence came to Ceylon with a few strings attached.
That observable fact swerves us from the illusion of being independent. The generous aid flows steadily from right-wing Europeans and the left-wing orientals. Local politicians are at home with initiating dialogues to generate funds. Funds make the country extremely dependent on both parties; no politician of this generation would admit to this. Whether they admit or not, this would certainly burden future decision-makers.
Ceylon became Sri Lanka. The transformed country continues to obtain loans from the first world. Then how could it be called a civilisation Is Sri Lanka still a de facto colony of the first world This is proven further as the countrys development heavily relies on external influence.
Analysing art
Art is civilisations way of expressing its inner turmoil and proud adventures. Analysing art, historians and anthropologists are able to define cultures of forgotten civilisations. It is through this understanding that art and civilisation intertwine. Analysing art, one could derive from a reverse process if a past society was civilised or colonised.
All art is imitation. Artists imitate the nature around them to create work worthy of presentation. The imitation is copying art from art, or rather, copying art from another civilisation to gain recognition and fame.
On the other hand, every human being is equipped with an intellectual capacity to appreciate art. If not, the profession would be obsolete. Quite mistakenly, everyone wants to be an artist. A good trend, but it shall not be forgotten that art too, is a profession. To become an artist, you must create without imitating. A high level of commitment is necessary in this backdrop.
Sri Lankan art enthusiasts, in general, contaminate the creative process with imitation. It looks like an offshoot of the colonised lifestyle, which means we are dependent on something to prop ourselves up.
Western influence on theatre
On a different note, art should not be confused as a ritual. Both art and rituals share similar characteristics, though the former finds expression through cherishing humanity's strength over nature. Rituals are about natures power over man. In rituals, outer-world spirits are summoned to empower humankind, whereas art empowers humans to conquer the obstacles before him.
Sri Lanka does not produce adequate art. This does not come as a surprise, as art is a reflection of society. Similar to politicians depending on foreign aid, artists depend on foreign art as well as aid. Investments in art are considered a waste of money. This is prevalent in the Sri Lankan theatre as well.
Theatres rake in money from foreign movies. On certain occasions, film titles had also been changed to put on a western appearance. This has reached a point where youth grow up with foreign movies. This uprooted generation indicates a dearth of confidence. Music is no exception. Another hilarious existence is the reference to spring (wasanthaya) and snow (hima) in vernacular songs, though such elements bear a distant familiarity to a tropical country such as Sri Lanka. Old European movies and Tamil films have flooded the local theatre as remakes.
A waning industry
Art is not simply an expression. It is rather an institution within a civilised framework which must be considered a profession. Sri Lanka is currently at a loss for proper storytellers. The industry has been crippled owing to the charity approach undertaken by non-government organisations (NGOs) and foreign aid programmes.
Certain NGOs appear to play the role of the saviour of Sir Lankan art; this is not true. The whole purpose of foreign individuals volunteering to help us is shrouded in mystery. One of the first NGOs in Sri Lanka was the East India Company that eventually liaised with the traitors who stripped the Ceylonese of proper Independence. Another deadly element that had also gripped art during this country, are the NGO-funded pseudo art festivals and competitions. Societies involved with NGOs have their own cultural revelry, while cherishing an ignorant and uprooted lifestyle.

Gazette on drug price reduction within two weeks
The gazette notification on reducing the price of 25 items including expensive cancer drugs will be issued within the next two weeks.
The government will be able to save Rs. two billion only by reducing the price of expensive cancer drugs, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
The minister added that since people are unable to afford expensive cancer drugs, the government buys 95 percent of the drug requirement while the private sector buys only five percent.
He was addressing the Non-Communicable Diseases Council discussion, at the Health Ministry, recently.
The minister said the price of about 10 expensive cancer drugs will be reduced after the gazette issued within two weeks. The government spends about Rs. seven billion annually to import drugs.
The price of the cancer drug Trastuzumab had been brought down from Rs. 280,000 to Rs. 144,000. The price is reduced by Rs. 136,000 which is a significant amount, the minister added.

Sisters Shanaya and Nayantara Perera capture the fleeting moments in life for a worthy cause
Photographers are not born. Anyone with the flair to capture the versatility of the fleeting moments in life can create images which radiate freshness and the ageless capacity to enthrall. However not many have been able to link their passion with a worthy cause in such a grand scale.
Sisters Shanaya and Nayantara Perera started Photocause by clicking for a cause. Seven years, two exhibitions and a magazine later the two students of St Bridgets Convent, Colombo, have now taken to more advanced means of reaching beyond borders through their cancer awareness campaign. Using digital technology, the girls have made four videos in which they spread messages for positive change.
The 17 year old and 15 year old had witnessed the cancer treatments and its brutal side effects on a loved one early in their life.
One of our aunts who had even taken care of my mother when she was young died of breast cancer. That was a heartrending period for us but instead of suffering in silence we decided to do something about it, Shanaya recalled in an emotional tone.
She says that another reason why the girls wanted to do the project was because taking pictures and selling them online to raise funds for Sri Lanka Cancer Society was a unique concept.
The girls had always had a passion for photography. They had been capturing images since the age of eight and six years. They completed the Applied Photographer Course at the Photographic Society of Sri Lanka (PSSL) held at the Lionel Wendt when they were 14 and 12 years.
Photocause took wings in 2011. The name springs from the idea of using photography for a cause. Their first exhibition was in 2015 at the National Art Gallery. The second one followed in 2017 at the J D A Perera Gallery. They showcased 80 of their work along with photographs taken by other school children who had been invited to take part. Altogether around 120 photos made up the exhibitions.
Their photographs evoke an infinite variety of perception and interpretation. Through the images they share vignettes of frozen moments of life.
Armed with Cannon cameras and lenses the duo has ventured to all parts of the island from the seashores of the Galle Fort to the ancient ruins in Polonnaruwa and the wilderness of Wilpattu National Park. They have even captured the beautiful landscaped of Kandy and Ratnapura.
How do the girls connect with their pictures
There is a meditative moment of silence for concentration when I start taking photographs. You begin on a clean slate when you engage in the process. Both of us are not good at drawing. So this is the art that we can engage in to express ourselves. Each picture embodies a different message, Shanaya explained.
For Nayanatara photography is almost a form of therapy as it is relaxing in addition to being something she enjoys engaging in. She sees photography as a sensitive response to others.
Different people can interpret the same image in two different ways, she explained.
Shanaya stressed that event photography is not their thing. They are into art and wildlife photography.
We do not focus on people all the time. We go for landscapes and flora and fauna. We are often short of time due to our studies. So we go on our photo clicking sprees whenever we can.
Shanaya explained that they initially wanted to do a project on behalf of animal welfare.
Our aunts death left a deep rooted impact within us. We witnessed the suffering she went through. This changed our perspective and we wanted to do something on behalf of our dear one in trying to create awareness and cancer prevention, she said adding that they also do volunteer work at the ABC School for Special Needs Children in Colombo. They are also national award-winning archers and gifted ballet dancers.
Queried if they have any favourites among their collection and the girls break into smiles. Nayathara says that she loves a picture of a dried up tree which has won her many awards and a picture of a leopard she shot some years back while Shanaya also chooses two: a big black bear climbing a tree and peeking through the branches which reminds her of Winnie the Pooh and a picture of a leopard captured in a striking pose.
Awake, a slim bound magazine focusing on cancer awareness was also launched by the team as a part of the project last year. The magazine had been distributed among 20 schools.
They say that their father, Mangala Perera, and their mother, Gayana Perera, have been very supportive towards the initiative. They also have a four year old sister named Alisha who is already following them around with her own mini camera.
Their latest project, the videos relates the tales of cancer survivors. It spreads the message that cancer does not necessarily mean death.
It is another way in life to overcome it. You need to take steps to detect it early. A video gets thousands of views. We encourage the viewers to go for a health check up early. So one view could mean one life saved, Shanaya explained adding that there is a lot of fear towards cancer.
We all have cancer cells in our body. However some have it more than others. It all depends on what stage you are in. Early detection saves lives, she added.
Photocause bagged the Plaque of Appreciation in 2017. The Foundation for Civilian Bravery awarded the Gold Medal in the Student category in Civilian Bravery-Social Activity to them this year.
Do not wait until someone tells you to do something. Do what needs to be done. Pick a topic and start working on it. You do not necessarily have to focus on a disease. It can be another topic like animal welfare or gender equality. It does not matter how many people listen to you because the numbers will grow gradually, they opined.
The sisters hope to take the Photocause exhibition to an international scale by inviting school children from other countries to send in their photographs in the future.

Govt.ensures peoples right to own land - PM
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe on Tuesday said that the incumbent government is ensuring the peoples right to own a plot of land, though the previous regime sold lands outright to foreigners.
He stressed the government led by President Maithripala Sirisena has not sold out an inch of land to foreigners.
The Prime Minister was speaking at a ceremony in Baddegama in the Galle district to distribute land deeds to landless families in Baddegama under the governments programme to provide 1 million land deeds to the families who do not own their own plot of land.
We show no hesitation in taking bold decisions for the sake of the country and the people. The former regime had allegedly sold lands to Chinese companies outright for the construction of the Colombo Financial City.
The Prime Minister added that the Good Governance Government succeeded in renegotiating the Colombo Port City agreement and the reclaimed lands have been assigned to Chinese companies on a 99 year lease.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe said the land in which the Sri Lanka Army Headquarters was situated, had been sold to the Shangrilla Hotel outright.

Healthy start for school
School is a time when children start to make independent choices about their lifestyles. School aged children learn quickly and are influenced by friends and popular trends. This is an important time to talk about and encourage healthy food habits.
Involving children in planning and preparing their own lunchboxes gives them the opportunity to learn about healthy eating, and also gives them a chance to make autonomous decisions about what they will be eating during the day.
Involve your children in healthy choices
Some tips to help get your kids involved include:
Talk to your children about what they would like to have in their lunchbox. Discuss healthier food and drink choices and decide what will be in the lunchbox together.
Write a shopping list together. Take your children shopping with you and let them choose foods and drinks from the shopping list.
Encourage your children help prepare their lunchboxes. Older children may be able to prepare most of their lunch themselves, and younger children can help with making sandwiches or cutting up soft fruit.
It is a good idea to prepare lunchboxes the evening before to allow children to participate.
Tips for healthy lunchboxes include:
Cut up large pieces of fruit and put them in a container  this makes it easier to eat, especially if your child has wobbly teeth or if they have less time to eat than they are used to.
Consider giving a sandwich, as this is an easy way to get a healthy fill.
In the hot weather, send yoghurt or milk.
Go for colour and crunch in the lunch box by offering a variety of colourful vegetables and fruit.
What not to put in school lunches
Some items do not belong in a healthy school lunchbox. Six items to avoid when preparing lunch for your children include:
All sweet drinks such as fruit juices, fruit drinks, cordials and soft drinks. These are high in energy (kilojoules) and sugar, and can lead to weight gain and oral health problems in children
Dried fruit bars and straps. These are low in fibre and are also high in sugar and can stick to childrens teeth, causing tooth decay.
Dairy desserts, chocolate bars and muesli bars. These are generally high in fat and sugar.
Chocolate spreads, jams and honey in sandwiches. These add extra, unnecessary sugar to the lunchbox
Oven-baked savoury biscuits. These may sound like healthier options, but some are just as high in salt and fat as crisps.

idea2funds Bakamuna hosts  Art-Therapy for Children
Bakamuna collaborated with the Center of Hope on a Mixed Media Art Therapy Workshop, held recently in Mattakkuliya. Bakamuna is a mixed media lifestyle design brand, enabled by MTI Consultings idea2fund.
Proceeds from Bakamunas first ever Pop-up at The Hilton Colombo was used to conduct this workshop at the Mattakkuliya center.
The Pop-up held in June, where Bakamuna presented a range of mixed media lifestyle products through their bullock cart concept, was a resounding success, and it was all done with a worthy cause in mind.
The workshop was conducted for a group of forty children from the Center between the ages of seven and twelve, who have specifically shown an interest in art.
We consider it a priority to provide our children with the right support to help them understand their own value and uniqueness. Art is not only a creative outlet for them but it can also help to boost their confidence and self-esteem. stated Prasad Alex Perera  COO, Center of Hope.
Mixed media integrates two or more artistic mediums such as, ink and pastel or paint and collage into a single composition. Through the use of mixed media, Bakamuna offered these children the opportunity to express and explore thoughts and feelings about themselves that are sometimes difficult to put into words. Through Bakamuna we not only create, connect and collaborate but we also encourage the community to celebrate life through art! Art as a form of therapy is about spontaneous creative expression - skill is not the focus. The creative process of art making can help to improve and enhance mental and emotional well-being and by offering kids the opportunity to express and explore thoughts and feelings about themselves in a safe, comfortable space they learn how to use art as a form of expression. said Chief Bakamuna/CEO Rochelle Bibile.
Started in 1979 and originally known as Project Love Care, the center in Mattakkuliya was first set up in response to the plight of the then recently emerged Summitpura slum-community. Bakamuna is a mixed media lifestyle design brand that aims to create, connect and collaborate.

India make short work of last day to beat England
Nottingham, Wednesday: India beat England by 203 runs in the third Test at Trent Bridge on Wednesday to cut the home side's lead in the five-match series to 2-1.
England, set a mammoth 521 to win, were bowled out for 317.
India needed just 10 minutes to wrap up victory with Wednesday's 17th ball after England resumed the fifth day on 311 for nine, the match ending when Ravichandran Ashwin had England No 11 James Anderson caught by Ajinkya Rahane at slip -- the first wicket for an India spinner in this fixture.
This was just India's seventh Test match victory in England.
It was also a personal triumph for India captain and man-of-the-match Virat Kohli who made 103 in his side's second innings 352 for seven declared following the star batsman's first-innings 97.
England, whose captain Joe Root won the toss and fielded, slumped to 161 all out in their first innings when they were punished by Hardik Pandya's five for 28 -- the medium-pacer's maiden five-wicket haul in Test cricket.
They suffered another top-order slump in a second innings where they had to make cricket history to pull off an improbable win -- no side have made more in the fourth innings to win a Test than the West Indies' 418 for seven against Australia at St John's, Antigua in 2003.
England were in dire trouble at 62 for four before a stand of 169 between Jos Buttler, whose 106 was his maiden Test century, and Ben Stokes (62) kept India at bay. But the recalled India fast bowler Jasprit Bumrah then took three wickets for eight runs in five balls on his way to innings figures of five for 85 in 29 overs to leave England on the brink of defeat.
This win kept alive India's hopes of becoming just the second team, after a Don Bradman inspired Australia in 1936/37, to win a five-match Test series from 2-0 down.
It also represented a remarkable turnaround following their innings and 159-run loss in the second Test at Lord's.
"The victory was much needed at this stage of the series and to have a performance like that, which was so clinical in all three departments, is something that was pleasing to me as a captain," said Kohli at the presentation ceremony.
"The players are really proud of what they've done in this Test too. Everyone is taking responsibility at the right time," he added.
Root admitted England's first-innings batting had let them down.
"It's fair to say that we very much under-performed in that innings," he said. "You look at the second innings and the partnership between Buttler and Stokes and that's a real lesson to our side in how to play Test match cricket.
"Not the fact that they scored at a slower rate or looked to be more defensively minded, but the way they adapted to the situation and were very clear about how they were going to score their runs," Root added.
The fourth Test at Southampton starts on August 30.

Indian Govt unveils draft UDAN scheme for intl routes
The Indian Aviation Centre has unveiled a draft scheme for extending the affordable air travel programme UDAN to international circuits, with state governments identifying the routes for operation.
The draft International Air Connectivity (IAC) scheme envisages to increase the international ticketing to 20 crore by 2027.
The scheme is to be made operational only for states, which demonstrate their commitment to implement and provide the requisite support for promoting operations under the scheme, the draft reads. Stakeholders inputs and comment have been sought till September 4.
UDAN was launched in 2016 to make air travel affordable for people through subsidised ticket rates and to provide air connectivity to smaller towns.
Some states and aviation leaders had earlier suggested to expand the UDAN scheme overseas.
The Assam government has, in fact, announced Rs 100 crore as viability gap funding to promote international air connectivity from Guwahati.
SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh had earlier this year pitched for an initiative on the lines of the regional connectivity scheme UDAN that can encourage Indian airlines to fly overseas.
According to the draft scheme, state governments will identify the routes to be connected, and airline operators will assess demand on the identified routes and submit proposals for providing connectivity.

As per a new report in Bollywood Hungama, filmmaker Karan Johars Dostana 2, starring Janhvi Kapoor and Sidharth Malhotra, is already in the works.Karan Johar always wanted to make Dostana 2, especially after the first film worked so well. Now finally he has a script for the film, which of course will speed up production. As for the cast, Karan has finalised both Sidharth Malhotra and Janhvi Kapoor, and is currently looking out for the third lead role that will again be a male lead, a source told Bollywood Hungama.

Kaduru shortage puts mask-makers in difficulty
The traditional mask-making industry in Ambalangoda is at the imminent threat of disappearing within a few years due to the difficulty of obtaining Grey Milkwood (Kaduru), mask artistes said.
They said about 5,000 families in the country earning their living through mask-making, would lose their employment while the country would be deprived of foreign exchange.
A mask artiste, Juwanwadu Badrananda Wijesooriya said that artistes find it difficult to find Kaduru (Cerbera Manghas) wood since authorities have not taken measures to plant these trees. He added that this wood, which is not used for anything else, is the ideal raw material for mask-making.
The artiste added that Kaduru trees were abundant in the paddy fields in Ambalangoda and were used for mask-making.
The wood was not bought earlier, Wijesooriya said. But now, there is no wood even to buy. We have to go further to Karandeniya to find Kaduru wood, he added.
He said local and foreign tourists, and university students are attracted to this industry. Mask-making, initiated in Ambalangoda, was later expanded to areas such as Bentota, Horana and Piliyandala.
He said mask-making artistes have requested the Ambalangoda Divisional Secretary to allow them to plant Kaduru in marshy lands in Ambalangoda, Godahena and Thalgasgoda areas but they have not responded yet.
When queried, Ambalangoda Divisional Secretary Sarasi Gunasekara said such a request had not been made in writing.
If they need to plant Kaduru in paddy fields, they have to take permission from the Agrarian Services Commissioner, Gunasekara said.
If they need to plant them in marshy lands, they have to take permission from the Hikkaduwa Wildlife Office, she said.

Mahes Gunatilake to conduct coaching program for wicket-keepers
Efficient glovesman Mahes Gunatilake has made arrangements to conduct a coaching program for school wicket-keepers in the Kandy District. It is a good scheme and will help all budding wicket keepers to sharpen their skills. He comes on an invitation from the Kandy District Cricket Association. He is all-out to give back to the game his knowledge and the experience he gained during his cricketing career.
Malcolm Perera, former Director of Coaching at Sri Lanka Cricket and presently the chairman of coaching committee of Kandy District Cricket Association is in charge of all the arrangements.
The program is scheduled to be held on 31 August at Kingwood College Randles Hills grounds. All wicket-keepers are requested to be present in training attire by 8.30 a.m. Further details can be had from Malcolm Perera on 0772418814.
Mahes Gunatilake was the best wicket keeper the country has seen. A product of St. Anthonys College he led the school side in 1971. When we talk about the best wicket-keepers, the first name that comes to mind is none other than the legendary Kandy wicket keeper and right hand batsman Mahesh Gunatilake, who was the countrys first Test wicket-keeper. He played in Sri Lankas inaugural Test against England in 1982 and appeared in only four more Tests and six one-day internationals, before being banned by the authorities for undertaking a rebel tour of South Africa in 1982/83.
Mahes learnt his cricket from under 14, and was well guided from junior level. The school where he learnt his game St. Anthonys College has produced many top Sri Lankan cricketers like the worlds highest wicket taker Muthiah Muralitharan and one of the best opening batsman A.C.M. Lafir. In the mid 1920s they had a great batsman by the name of Jack Anderson. Anderson played from 1916 to 1920, which was the schools golden years of cricket. It was called the Anderson era because he was a hero in almost every game that was played in those days.
Gunatilake was the first Antonian to play in an official test match. Some of his school team mates were Merril Dunuwille, Jayantha Monnekulame, Premalal de Silva, Terrance Sims, Merril Guneratne, Suresh Gunatilake his brother, Bernard Ranasinghe, Philomen Raj and Jack Robertson.

Monroes lost nude scene resurfaces
Marilyn Monroe remains a pinnacle of American beauty and the classic pinup of Hollywoods bygone golden era. Her untimely death at the youthful age of 36 solidified her status as an icon.
Now 56 years after the actress died, her first nude scene in film has been recovered, long after it was believed to have been lost or destroyed. The footage is from Monroes final feature film, The Misfits, which she starred in opposite Clark Gable.
The Misfits was filmed in 1960 and written by Monroes husband Arthur Miller. The plot centers on Monroe, a recently widowed woman, who ends up with three cowboys vying for her attention in the Nevada desert.
The whereabouts of the footage was uncovered by Charles Castillo, the author of a forthcoming biography on the actress, Marilyn Monroe: The Private Life of a Public Icon.
Castillo discovered that the footage had not been destroyed during an interview with The Misfits producers (Frank Taylor) son Curtice Taylor, who revealed that he had kept in a locked cabinet since his fathers death nearly twenty years ago in 1999. Taylor, a photographer, told the Daily Mail that a lot of times, unused takes were destroyed. But Frank Taylor believed that it was so important and so ground-breaking that he saved it.
Living up to her sex symbol status, Monroe reportedly went nude while filming without warning, much to the chagrin of director, John Huston. Her impromptu disrobing was not appreciated by Huston, however, who felt it was unnecessary for the scene.
Taylor believes Monroe probably threw the bed sheet off because she was sick of the restrictions of the shoot; the actress was supposed to put on a blouse all while ensuring that a bed sheet kept her body fully hidden.
At the time there were strict rules about censorship in film; men and women were not allowed to be in the beds at the same time due to the suggestive implications.
For decades, it has been thought that Monroes only nude scene was in the unreleased film Somethings Got to Give, which showed the starlet naked in a swimming pool. However, the discovery of this footage proves that this was in fact not the first time she had gone au naturel in front of the camera.
Had the footage of Monroe made the final cut, it would have been the first time anyone had ever gone nude in a feature film. Instead, this honour was bestowed upon Jayne Mansfield, whose nude appearance in 1963s Promises! Promises! was the first of any mainstream actress.
Monroe famously had nude pictures of herself, taken before she found success as an actress, published in Playboys first edition by Hugh Hefner who bought the pictures of Monroe from the photographer for just $500.

No waste will enter country under Singapore FTA
National Policies and Economic Affairs State Minister Dr. Harsha de Silva assured that no municipal waste will enter the country through the Singapore FTA and the status quo will remain as before.
He said the laws pertaining to imports will apply to whatever is being brought into the country and import and export of waste or other harmful materials cannot be controlled by imposing duties and they can only be controlled through Non-Tariff Barriers (NTBs).
Addressing the media at Sirikotha yesterday, the State Minister said various groups had alleged that the FTA will pave way for waste products to be dumped in Sri Lanka.
Refuting this allegation, he said waste products including human waste, clinical waste, municipal waste had been mentioned in the FTA under the duty-free list.
But this is not a new thing and they have also been included in Pakistan - Sri Lanka Free Trade Agreement (PSFTA) which came into force in 2005 when Mahinda Rajapaksa was the Prime Minister and also in the India-Sri Lanka FTA. But none of these countries have dumped their garbage in Sri Lanka, he said.
Sri Lankas rights under Article 20 of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) /1994 of WTO to take measures to protect human animal or plant life is ensured by inclusion of Article 17.7 on General Exemption under chapter 17 of the Agreement.
So under the Singapore- Sri Lanka FTA, these products cannot come into the country and those wastes have to go through the import licensing requirements and rules and regulations applicable to protect human, animal and plant life such as the quarantine law. Therefore Sri Lanka is free to introduce environmental measures to protect human, animal or plant life. Furthermore our rights under International environmental conventions that Sri Lanka is signatory to such as the Basel convention are not affected and Environmental laws and regulation of the country will continue to be applied, he said.
The State Minister said the Singapore- Sri Lanka FTA is very much essential to Sri Lanka since most of the countries have entered into intergovernmental agreements by forming trade blocks. So we cannot remain isolated in the world. Some countries have started to work together through global production networks.
He further said that countries in East Asia region have thriving trade and economic relations with each other through free trade agreements. The leaders of 16 participating countries established the Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership (RCEP) to broaden and deepening the engagement among parties and to enhance parties participation in economic development in the region.
The RCEP negotiations were launched by Leaders from ten ASEAN Member States Brunei Darussalam, Cambodia, Indonesia, Lao PDR, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam and six ASEAN FTA partners Australia, China, India, Japan, South Korea, and New Zealand. Only Bangladesh and Sri Lanka have not become RCEP members.
If we cannot enter into an agreement with at least one country how can we work with others he questioned.
He stressed the importance of being a member of RCEP claiming that the countrys future economic development is completely depends on the economic ties between other countries in the world.
The Minister further stressed that no Indian, Singapore or Pakistan national can enter the Sri Lankan job market through this agreement. He urged not to take political advantage by spreading baseless allegations with regard to this agreement.

Online education continues to grow in China
Online education is gaining momentum in China with the market scale expected to exceed 714 billion yuan ($104 billion) by 2025, a recent report from UBS Securities said.
According to the UBS report, the Chinese online education market will grow markedly from the 29 billion yuan reported last year.
Government support, technological progress, and a cultural emphasis on education have all contributed to a burgeoning online education market in China, said Liu Jiehao, an analyst at consultancy iiMedia.
This combination of factors has given the countrys online education a boost, and analysts point out that Chinese parents are a key driver.
Edwin Chen, an analyst from UBS, said: Chinese parents have high expectations for their children, wanting their kids to get into Tsinghua or Peking University. This is creating huge demand.
In China, education is always high on the agenda for parents and their children. The majority of Chinese parents expect their kids to continue learning after the end of the school day.
One important reason that we choose to take extra classes online is that our child can get one-on-one tutoring without wasting time in traffic, especially in Beijing, said Wang Liping, a mother of a 15-year-old boy from Beijing.However, Chinese parents currently pay for fewer extra classes than their neighbors in Asia, leaving huge room for growth.
The UBS report pointed out that about 37 percent of Chinese parents paid for tuition compared with 70 percent in places such as Japan and South Korea.
The wider acceptance of online after-school tutoring has led to vigorous competition among education companies in China.
VIPKid, a Chinese online education company, recently raised $500 million in its latest round of financing, the worlds largest-ever fundraising in the online education sector.
The fresh fundraising pushed the companys valuation over 20 billion yuan, making it the biggest online education company globally.
The Beijing-based company, founded in 2013, provides children with one-on-one online English courses, and links teachers from North America with Chinese kids aged 4 to 12.
The latest data from the company showed it has enrolled more than 60,000 foreign teachers in its network, enabling it to work with 500,000 paid users The financing accelerated the accumulative effect of the countrys online education segment, said Lyu Senlin, founder and chief researcher at Learneasy Times Online Education Research Institute, an industry research consultancy.He said that industry leaders are competing for bigger market share and pushing small firms out in this segment.
In recent years, TAL Education Group and New Oriental Education & Technology Group, Chinas top two education players, are transforming from offline to online and putting great emphasis on online education.
TAL unveiled its latest technology products and online solutions in July, aiming to step up technology efforts to back up its online businesses.The company is striving to advance education through technology, hoping to build a large-scale, low-cost and high-quality online education experience, said Zhang Bangxin, founder and CEO of TAL.The platforms latest fiscal report showed the transformation to be a success.
Revenue of Xueersi Online School, the online subsidiary of TAL, soared by 158 percent year-on-year in the fourth quarter of the 2018 fiscal year.However, the industry still faces challenges, according to Zheng Wencheng, an education expert and founder of Hyphen Education, a Shanghai-based online education platform.
Teachers working online often fail to realize that students may be bored and not concentrating on lessons, he said.
To tackle the problem, an array of companies are scrambling to leverage high-tech solutions to make online teaching more personalized and appealing.
Hyphen, for example, has developed an artificial intelligence-enabled product to improve students learning and teaching experience online.
The technology can help recognize and analyze students responsiveness as well as their ability to grasp lessons, which could help teachers adjust their teaching methods quickly.
If we compare online education to driving a car, then we hope technology can act like an intelligent assistant to help drivers (teachers) to better control the speed and the direction, he said. (ChinaDaily.com)

Dr. Koralage sustained serious injuries from the attack by some students in Hilda Obeysekarapura Mawatha in Peradeniya-Galaha Road. He received treatment at Kandy and Colombo National Hospitals.Anuradhapura Hospital sources said that it would take about another two months for the full recovery of the Consultant as his hand had been injured and he finds it difficult to perform complex surgeries.
This had led to the suspension of all scheduled surgeries at the hospital and critical patients with head injuries are being transferred to the Colombo National Hospital. Dr Koralage was treating neuro-patients coming from Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Vavuniya, Puttalam, Jaffna and Mannar districts.
Patients who had been inconvenienced due to the absence of the doctor expressed their strong displeasure over the unruly attack by undergrads.
Meanwhile, One of the students who allegedly attacked Anuradhapura Neurosurgeon was taken into custody by Girandurukotte police yesterday. Accordingly, three student suspects who were involved in this attack which took place at the Peradeniya University premises are in remand custody.
The suspects are scheduled to be produced before the Mahiyanganaya Magistrate today(23).

Rs 400 mn Mailaddy fisheries harbour begins work
SCHOOLS NEAR JAFFNA CAMPS    WILL BE RELEASED - PRESIDENT
President Maithripala Sirisena said schools situated within the high security zone in the Mailaddy area, will be released within the next two weeks.
The President said the Mailaddy Maha Vidyalaya and a few other schools situated in security forces camp lands will be opened for educational activities within two weeks.
The President made these remarks while commencing the renovation activities of Mailaddy Fisheries harbour yesterday. The President laid the foundation for the Mailaddy fisheries harbour, which will be renovated at a cost of Rs 400 million aiming to streamline the fishing activities in the Jaffna area especially in the Kankesanthurai area.
The President further said that he has given necessary instructions to the Army Commander and Jaffna Army Commander to take necessary measure in this regard.
The President added that 88 per cent of land used for security purposes, had already been released by now. The balance of only 12% remaining lands have to be released. The President while highlighting the uselessness of war and armed conflicts said that nothing can be achieved by engaging in armed conflicts.
The war destroyed not only human lives but also humanity. The war destroys humanity first before destroying other human and physical resources. Therefor nothing can be achieved by armed conflicts or by war, he noted.
You have faced immense hardship from the war and it is not an exemption whether you are in North or South since all of us had been undergoing severe hardships during the terror period. Terrorism claimed many valuable lives regardless the ethnicity ie; whether Sinhala Tamil or Muslim. Valuable Tamil political leaders such as Amirthalingam, Neelam Thiruchelvam and moreover our best Foreign Minister Lakshman Kadirgamar and many others were lost to the country because of terrorism he said.
Speaking on the Mailaddy fisheries harbour, the President said the late leader S.J.V. Chelvanayagam had taken initiatives to start the Mailaddy fisheries harbour since then one third of the fisheries production in Jaffna was supplied from the area until the lifestyle of Jaffna was affected by terrorism. It can be reported that late President R. Premadasa has also contributed to the development of the fisheries activities based on the harbour in 1980s, the President said.
President Sirisena noted that the freedom for speech and expression had been established now and therefore everyone can level any allegation even against the President of the country now.
When paying attention to social media it can be seen how certain people sling mud at me through social media. If such things happened during the last regime, the persons who involved in these attacks would have been under six feet he added.
During the last three and half years,the Government had taken a significant measures to uplift the standard of people. The President questioned whether one could travel to the North freely before 2015.
Speaking on the development of Jaffna, the President said a significant amount of funds was allocated from every budget annually for Jaffnas development.However it can be seen sometimes that the development rate in the North is somewhat low than expected,he said.
A Presidential Task Force has been appointed to look in the development of the Northern area. The task force is scheduled to meet next week and I invite every political leadership to take part in it without looking through political glasses. The task force will identify the need of the area and make a priority list while observing the on-going activities, he said.

Season for rankings, Asian targets and Achilles heel that looms
The month of Augustus has its own historical milestones of epic proportions...most significant of all being Roman Emperor Augustus Caesar and his blind ambition to rule the known world.
So it follows that August is known for its conquests and particularly a grand series of remarkable resistance by Queen Cleopatra the Great and her beloved Eygyptian.
For us Asians in Sri paradise the imposing Asian Games has its confrontation with destiny ...as we speak.
The islands biggest contingent, hoping to conquer Asia and write our own history.
Standing tall at the head of that front line...Sri Lanka rugby 7s unit led by the hardworking Muthutanthri and a fair chunk of experience.
The sharp footed Sooriyabandara, the efficient finisher Danush Ranjan, the maestro man Jason Dissa, reliable Gayan Weeraratne, impact Ritchie Dharma....hard hitting Omalka Gunarat, pace Kavinda and creative Dixon.
These are our 7s gladiators who wish to carve their own history...defy science and command respect in the middle.
Between them and a podium finish...Japan, Hong Kong, Korea, and possibly China.
Our medal finish very much on the radar and about time.
Coach Woods simply confident, happy with the quality of this unit and hoping for the best Sri performance in history.
Those thoughts hugely echoed by all the rugby mad hearts islandwide.
What a grand prospect indeed.
We are certainly looking forward to an inspired tour by these Sri gladiators.
Realistically...a little concern about the Korean match is gnawing away...that is natural and needs correction.
Enough banter and blah, blah about this Korean Achilles heel...let the boys sort it out in the middle, and stamp their class upfront on day 1. The expectations are bubbling given that huge bubble in Hong Kong where I certainly believed that Sri Lanka belonged in the final of the U20 7s...coming 3rd was acceptable but surprising to Naveen H and the lads...how Korea outran us in extra time and only 6 on the park.
Similar echoes in Indonesia that need shutting up against Korea.
The Asian Games is the toughest litmus tester for all ARFU member countries this season and hopes of grading up for a World Series shot. A dream that needs action and results not words ....most significantly for us Sri islanders.
Looking beyond in September...its the 3rd leg ARFU 7s series and another chance with that ranking pendulum.
Both men and women prep mind and body for the battles ahead.
At this pertinent juncture...why arent our women, currently 6th in Asia ...not at the Asian Games
The men are 4th and adjusting to Indonesian delights...the women missing out for reasons concealed in some cheap file, stacked in the visa requests and other annoying red tape for the Asian games trip. Given our skills and natural talent capabilities ...Sri rugby...now in the hands of Bonsa, Dida Illyas, Nazeem Mohamed....well understand the priorities to be anxious about travelling our teams as much as possible.
Experience is from more time in the middle, against the best in Asia and beyond.
Time to shed the psychological burden of the big country mindset label....
Learn from KenyaUSA...Samoa, Canada and the selfbelief that gives them big impressive reps upfront, and staggering performance that stun the senses.
Sri Lanka needs this 7s magic full time ...and like our Fijian island brothers and sisters....
Eat breathe..walk..talk..sleep..absorb..digest....believe and live this 7s lifestyle.
Lets go Sri Lanka ..lets give our fellow island nations around planet rugby....something permanent to be proud of.
Bula bula Sri 7s Lanka.
Blessings for teams and the flag.

Severe drought driving people away from homelands
The scarcity of drinking water in several drought-affected villages in the Anuradhapura District is increasing.
Famer families in Mahanikawewa, Oyamaduwa, Siyambalewa, Eliya Oyamaduwa, Maningamuwa, Dahaye Kanuwa, Meda Oyamaduwa etc. in the Maha Wilachchiya DS division are severely hit by the drought. People are reported to be deserting their villages due to the dearth of drinking water.
Maha Wilachchiya Divisional Secretary E. R. Thilakarathana told the Daily News that many residents in his division are migrating to outstations, mainly Colombo and its suburbs seeking employment, as a result of the severe drought.
He said nearly 5,000 drought-stricken families in his division are provided with drinking water through bowsers.
Wilachchiya Gamunu community-based society Chairman M. Wimalaweera said there are nearly 115 families living in the Meda Oyamaduwa village since 1985. Their main income is chena cultivation.
We are facing a severe drought for about three years consecutively. We dont have any water to drink. Almost all of our cultivation is damaged. We have not received drought-relief for about two months. There is a large number of kidney patients living in our area. We have no alternative than to sell our milch cows and property where we live for our sustenance, he said.
It is learnt that nearly 25,000 families in Maha Wilachchiya, Nochchiyagama, Kahatagasdigiliya, Thirappane and Nuwaragam Palatha (Central) are suffering from an acute scarcity of drinking water. Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayaka told the Daily News that arrangements are made to provide drinking water to them using a fleet of bowsers under the patronage of the Disaster Management Ministry.

Shanghai, Alibaba in digital deal
Shanghai will deepen its digitalization push as it builds itself into a global digital city, through a strategic deal with internet giant Alibaba Group Holding Ltd announced on Thursday.
The move aims to catapult the municipality to the forefront of economic opening-up, and deepen coordinated development across the Yangtze River Delta region, which includes neighboring Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui provinces.
Shanghais Party chief Li Qiang said the city will fully support Alibabas industrial deployment and the promotion of innovative business scenarios in areas such as internet finance, new retail and smart city tech.
According to Alibaba Chairman Jack Ma, the company will introduce a growing number of new businesses, technologies, products and models to Shanghai.
Under the agreement, Alibaba and its financial arm Ant Financial Services Group pledged to raise their investment in the city. The efforts involve accelerating the construction of Alibabas Hongqiao center - home to Shanghais key transportation hub that connects numerous cities in the region - and the Shanghai headquarters of payment tool Alipay and wealth management platform Ant Fortune.
Alibaba vowed to enhance the citys service industry, which accounted for nearly 70 percent of its economic output last year. The company will provide its proprietary cloud computing, big data and internet of things capabilities, and bolster the development of new retail, smart logistics and environmental governance in the Yangtze River Delta region through digital means.
Shanghais goal of becoming an international financial center will depend on technologies such as blockchain, mobile payments, credit scoring and financial risk controls provided by Ant Financial.
The partners will explore best practices in the building and administration of smart cities by expanding civil services-related mobile applications.
On the retail front, Alibaba promised to continue combining its online and offline resources by employing a suite of technologies such as artificial intelligence to benefit both consumers and merchants, and to increase Shanghais allure as a leading shopping destination.
Alibaba said it will invite 200 top overseas brands to the China International Import Expo scheduled for November. It will leverage its consumer platform to help international merchants connect with Chinese shoppers.
It also plans to expand its Hema Fresh supermarket chain. The brand made its debut in Shanghai two years ago, with the prototype store merging digital and physical shopping experiences by adopting technologies to maximize operation efficiency.
Tang Huihao, deputy director of the Shanghai Statistics Bureau, identified the new economy featuring the application of internet technologies as a crucial factor driving economic growth.
Shanghais total retail sales of consumer goods grew 7.7 percent in the first six months year-on-year, which Tang attributed to the proliferation of Alipays mobile payment solution and Ele.me, an on-demand food delivery platform owned by Alibaba. Ele.mes daily transaction volume has topped 100 million yuan ($14.7 million). (ChinaDaily.com)

SIGHT FOR SORE eyes!
Defining a concealer
A concealer is a flesh-toned cosmetic stick used to cover spots, blemishes, and dark under-eye circles
When to apply concealer in a make up routine
One needs to apply a concealer to conceal blemishes or dark spots. You may apply concealer to your entire face if desired right after primer but in most cases all you need to do is cover areas of uneven tone, acne, and other blemishes. Dab gently with a finger, concealer brush, or sponge until you cannot see the break between concealer and the surrounding.
Determining the shade of your concealer
For the under eye area, be sure to select a shade of concealer that is no more than one or two shades lighter than your natural skin tone to avoid an obvious white circle around the eye area. For your face, select a concealer that matches the colour of your foundation exactly.
Amount of application
Concealers come in many different forms. There are sticks, potted creams, and pencils. These all offer different types of coverage, and some may be better for certain skin types than others.
If you have large pores and oily skin, you may want to avoid cream or stick concealers, as they may make your pores look bigger. Look for a liquid concealer instead. Use a pencil concealer for acne, as the pointed edge makes it easier to apply around the acne spots. Thicker, cream concealers are also effective as they can be moulded and blended over the blemish.
Be sure to apply your concealer all the way to the very base of your lash line, directly under your waterline. Dotting concealer under your eye in a U-shape will appear less natural, and it may be noticeable in photographs.
Setting concealer
When you are certain all your dark spots and under eye circles have been covered and blended, add a layer of foundation over the top of your concealer. To kill two birds with one stone, use a loose or compact powder foundation. You can also use a cream or liquid foundation, but you will have to add an additional setting powder over the top.
Spread your foundation over the entirety of your face. Use a translucent setting powder with a large brush over the top of your foundation to set it for a solid 12 hours.
Use a brush to reach the inside corners of your eyes and under your lash line. Make sure that you cover every part of your face that also has concealer.
Dab a little extra powder over the areas where you put concealer to make sure that they wont run off over the course of the day.
Tips to conceal under eye dark circles
Dark circles tend to be blue or gray in colour. To conceal them you need to apply a colour thats opposite on the colour wheel, which would be peach or orange.
If you have fair skin, choose a light to medium peach colour. For medium to dark skin, pick a dark peach or orange colour. When choosing a concealer go for a shade that is one or two shades darker than your skin colour. Its really important to pick a darker shade, so it actually hides your dark circles. Apply the concealer in an upside down triangle with your ring finger, low enough under the eyes to completely cover the area. Dont worry about your under eyes looking orange, we will blend it out in the next step.
Eye make up for those with under eye dark circles
Warmer eye shadow colours flatter dark circles by adding softness. Look for peachy, orangey, and bronzy colours.

## Title: Speed up installation of low-cost Humps
## Supertitle:

Speed up installation of low-cost Humps
I was surprised to learn from the media that 200 railway gates with electric bell and light systems are to be installed at a cost of USD 6.4 million. At the current exchange rate, it works out to an astounding Rs.5.2 million per gate with the total direct investment exceeding Rs. one billion! Harking back to the past, it was reported on March 2, 2015 that the Railway department had installed 20 railway gates with electric alarm bells at a huge cost of Rs. 10 million per gate! Thereafter, the Transport Ministry had recommended a proposal by the previous government, (Appearing in the media on May 18, 2014) to install 200 similar rail gates with bell and light systems at a much lower figure of Rs. 4.15 million (Still high in our view) in collaboration with the University of Moratuwa and a Private Firm.
The present move is clearly a resurrection of the latter proposal being considered at a higher exchange rate for the Dollar. We are at a loss to understand why such extravagant and ineffective technical solutions eating into our meagre Forex reserves and Billions of tax payers monies are recommended at a time when our deeply indebted country is afflicted with debt repayment and balance of payment problems It adds insult to injury when we hear about salary increases and luxury chairs for politicians!
In the wake of a series of tragic accidents at Railway gates, the writer proposed a low cost, viable alternative for Rail-gates which was first published in both Sinhala and English press as far back as in the year 2013, followed by several reminders through the years 2014 to 2017.
Frequent breakdowns
As mentioned in my above proposal, these electric rail-gates entail high maintenance costs and in addition are liable to frequent breakdowns due to rainy weather, excessive heat etc. Besides, as proved in the Wanawasala, Batuwatte and Hideniya tragedies, electric bell and light systems have been defective due to exposure to elements. A valid comment by an eye-witness at the Wanawasala tragedy sums up my point: No one can rely on that bell. Sometimes when it rains heavily it rings continuously till someone fixes it. Vehicles with their shutters closed and the radios on, wouldnt hear it on most occasions.
These tragedies repeatedly point to the fact that negligence over-rides high-cost technical solutions such as barrier gates and bell and light warning systems. Constructing over- head bridges for motor vehicles at rail crossings is another costly solution. It adds insult to injury, when negligent drivers ignore the visual and audio traffic signals and drive on unhindered. No doubt, the latter danger can be curtailed by railway gates but certainly not at such enormous cost!
As a viable low-cost alternative to this high cost rail gate systems, I suggested that concrete speed-breakers (Humps) be installed at a safe distance (five to seven metres) ahead of each crossing on both sides of the road. In order to adequately warn the vehicle drivers, a visible red coloured danger signal with appropriate lettering should be painted on the face of the Hump itself so that it would be clearly visible even during the night.
Speed-breakers
The forced slow-down or stoppage of the vehicles due to the presence of the Hump will enable the motorists to clearly read and see the danger signal and exercise caution before crossing the railway track. It should be mentioned that Sri Lankan motorists are quite responsive to speed-breakers and we have not come across any major accidents caused by them.
To make this preventive measure more effective I have suggested the following additional steps.
1) Display the usual Traffic signal used to indicate a Railway crossing in a more prominent manner (Luminous) to attract the attention of vehicle drivers.
2) Clear the immediate vicinity of the railway crossings of trees and shrubs to improve the sight of an approaching train.
3) Instruct all Railway engine drivers by circular to toot the engine horns adequately to attract the attention of those passing the railway track at any railway crossing.
Though belated, the Railway Department started responding to my proposal and by May 2017 they were reported to have installed 111 humps. I have requested the Railway Department to update me with the present status of the Humps for the benefit of the public. It is unfortunate that Hindeniya rail crossing was not protected by Humps which surely would have averted this tragic accident.
With so much money being spent on carpeted and concrete roads, why not the concerned authorities speed up the installation of these permanent, quick to construct, low-cost, maintenance-free, effective speed-breakers also referred to as Sleeping Policemen at all possible crossings and prevent further unfortunate accidents and wastage of scarce financial resources.

Foul start deprives Lanka of possible swim medal:
Sri Lanka clinch first baseball win beating Laos 15-10
Debutant Sri Lankan baseball team opened their campaign in style when they beat Laos 15-10 in the ongoing Asian Games in Jakarta yesterday. This is the very first international competition the Sri Lanka national baseball team was taking part in. Coincidentally their opponents Laos too were making their debut at the Asian Games.
Sri Lanka ranked seventh in Asia and a world rank of 47 will take on Thailand (ranked 56 in the world) today.
Unfortunately Sri Lanka missed one of its biggest medal hopes in the men's 100m freestyle relay swimming event as Kyle Abeysinghe had to pull out from the race due to a foul start. Lankan swimmers completed the race in 3:22.34 secs which would have been a new Sri Lanka record and an easy access to the final, if not for the Kyle's fault. The team comprised Matthew Abeysinghe, Cherantha de Silva, Akalanka Peiris and Kyle. Matthew gave Sri Lanka a fine start completing the first lap clocking 49.16 secs. Kyle was the next swimmer who finished second followed by Cherantha and Akalanka respectively who completed the race.
Sri Lanka was placed overall sixth in the 100m freestyle relay preliminaries where 18 countries participated and should have been a medal hope if not for the disqualification.
The same swimming quartet holds the Sri Lanka record for the event (3:22.84secs) which they have set up at this year's Commonwealth Games semi-final round. They faced the same fate in the Commonwealth Games final round and got disqualified.
Following yesterday's disqualification relay team's coach Michel Aaron said that lack of practice together can lead to this type of faults.
"Technically it has been reported as a foul start by Kyle. The main reason for such faults is practicing individually. The swimmers get together only at this type of international events which can lead to coordination and communication problems. It is very important for a relay team to practice together for a fair amount of time before the big events. If we are to overcome these errors the swimmers must start practicing together months before the top events," coach Aaron explained.
Akalanka Peris will compete today in the 50m butterfly stroke and 200m backstroke preliminaries while Cherantha de Silva will also compete in the 50m butterfly stroke initial round. Abeysinghe brothers will swim in the 100m freestyle first round today.
Commonwealth Games weightlifting silver medalist Indika Dissanayaka competing in the 69kg weight class lifted 130kgs in the snatch but failed in all three attempts of the clean and jerk lift.
Sri Lanka scored a victory in Taekwondo yesterday when Chalinda Sampath competing in the 63kg weight class beat his Japanese opponent Masanoja Homma 21-18. But he was defeated by Uzbekistan's Sador Toyrov 6-22 and pulled out of the competition.
Today is the final day of the taekwondo events and Sri Lanka's Kumudu Kalpani will battle with Pakistan's Seid Zidra (49kgs) in the quarterfinal round.
The Lankan men's hockey team continued its losing streak going down to South Korea 8-0. They were thrashed 11-0 by Japan in their first game.
Lankan woman weightlifter Chamari Warnakulasuriya who set up a new Sri Lanka record in the 53kg weight class on Monday with a performance of 96kg in clean and jerk ended up in 10th place in the finals out of 12 contestants.
The match between Lankan 3x3 basketball women's team and host Indonesian counterparts was scheduled to dribble off yesterday night.
At the end of the fourth day China took the lead in the medals table and Japan were in second place with South Korea placed third. Indonesia and Iran were placed fourth and fifth respectively.

Time to trim the fat
Finance and Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera is one of the few straight-talking politicians we have in our midst, who never hesitates to call a spade a spade even if its costs him politically or his views are at variance with his Cabinet colleagues. Minister Samaraweera, it was, who suggested that liquor shops be permitted to open without a time restriction and women be allowed to purchase liquor, over the counter, and work at places plying the liquor trade.
The minister made the suggestion knowing full well that he was bound to incur the wrath of the Maha Sangha and also the harassed wives who undergo ordeals at the hands of their drinking husbands, no doubt costing the minister a not inconsiderable number of votes. The President, however, as expected, shot down the suggestion, letting the status-quo prevail.
Minister Samaraweera, once again, has made an unpopular suggestion, no doubt, knowing well the negative political consequences to him and the party he represents. Speaking at an event in Matara, over the weekend, the minister called for a total halt to all recruitment to the public sector, which, as is common knowledge, is bursting at the seams at present. He pointed out that many public institutions were presently overstaffed and recruiting more hands to the public sector will add more financial burden to these institutions."In fact the government service cannot afford to recruit more. In some public offices, where only 1,000 public servants are needed, there are about 3,000 workers. It is a sin to fill more and more people into these public institutions and I am also part of that sin. Over-staffing is a reason for those institutions to make losses", he explained.
This, indeed, is an understatement on the part of the minister. Over-staffing is the principal cause for the sorry plight our public sector institutions are placed in today which in turn has loaded a heavy burden on the tax payer. All political parties, since Independence, should take the responsibility for this sad state of affairs. Jobs were given through the 'chit' of the minister, or, sitting MP of the ruling party to his/her constituents, ignoring qualifications and suitability for the jobs dished out in this cavalier fashion. State Banks, the CPC, CEB were some of the state institutions which were turned into havens for the jobless, plunging the vital state bodies into financial black-holes.
The practice, no doubt, is continuing unabated, if the minister's statistics are to be believed. If, as he says, there are 3,000 workers in a government office when the requirement is only for 1,000, there indeed is something badly wrong somewhere, which calls for immediate remedial action. No doubt, this situation is brought about by the fact that both major parties are today sharing power. If, prior to this, only the winning party stuffed state bodies with their supporters, we now have public sector institutions having to take the combined weight of unproductive labour at the cost of the tax payer, although UNP MPs bemoan that they are yet unable to get jobs for their supporters even though it was the Greens who were at the levers of power.
The situation was reminiscent of the old SLTB, which was packed by political cronies under all governments, driving to the ground a once profit making public venture never to raise its head again. Baila singers who performed on the political stages were given top posts and other riff raff who went canvassing for politicians found their way into the SLTB, spelling doom to this vital public service body.
Hence, the time has come to do away with this ruinous culture and trim the fat in the public sector. Merit should be made the sole criterion for appointments. The recent move to hold heads of department in public sector bodies responsible for all excess staff in their departments, meaning they (heads of departments) will be forced to pay the salaries, out of their own pockets, of such excess staff, may well be the solution. Like the minister pointed out, at the same event, the public sector cannot afford to accommodate anymore recruits although there were plenty of openings in the private sector. These include labour sector jobs that offer better salaries than even what Lankan expats earn in the Middle East.
Above all, the era where youth were dependent on politicians for jobs should end. Like the minister said, the time has come to end the era where youth lined up in front of ministers' offices to get jobs. "We have started a new era where the people are empowered to take the responsibility for their future without going after politicians", Minister Samaraweera said.
For this, our youth should be equipped to fit into the modern day job demands. It follows that our education system too should be tailored to cater to this need, through a revision of curriculae. Avenues should also be opened for opportunities of self-employment. This is more so, since, by the minister's own admission, the public sector can no longer absorb any more labour. The time has, indeed, come for a sea-change in the whole aspect of public sector employment.

Washing vehicles at Aluthdivulwewa tank prohibited
The Working Committee of the Aluthdivulwewa Agrarian Association had decided not to permit buses and other vehicles to be washed in the Aluthdivulwewa tank in Galenbindunuwewa with effect from August 21.
Aluthdivulwewa Agrarian Association Chairman Premasiri Karunathilake said the association would take action against those who wash vehicles in the tank after this date.
He said that due to the washing of vehicles, the tank water is being polluted. Aquatic creatures such as fish and fresh water prawn are at risk due to pollution.
Karunathilake added that there was a thin film of oil on the surface of the water, causing a threat to the existence of aquatic creatures.
He said since most of the small tanks in the area have dried up due to the drought, people come to the Aluthdivulwewa tank for their water requirements.
Some people wash tractors, vans, three wheelers, lorries, cars and motorcycles in the tank. None of these vehicles would be permitted to be washed from August 21, he added.

Wayamba Ela Stage II begins tomorrow
President Maithripala Sirisena will inaugurate Stage II of the Wayamba Ela Project tomorrow.
This giant development project will supply water to the Northern Province minimising the water scarcity faced by the people in the Province in irrigating farmland.
Under this scheme, waters from the Mahaweli will be diverted from the Eastern Province to the Northern Province.
President Sirisena launched the first stage of the North Western Province Canal Project (NWPCP) on February 13 last year with a groundbreaking ceremony at the Wemedilla Left Bank Main Canal in Galewela.
The President at the launch said the aim of the project is to provide adequate irrigational water to farmers in the area during the Yala and Maha cultivation seasons.
Under the project, eight large tanks and 353 smaller tanks are to be developed.
This will ensure uninterrupted irrigation facilities to 12,500 cultivation lands directly benefitting 13,500 farmer families. Moreover, 80,000 farmer families will be indirectly benefited by the project.
At the launch the President pledged to take every effort to make the country prosperous in agriculture by enhancing the farmers economy.
According to Wayamba Ela Development Project Director Asoka Peiris the first stage of the Wayamba Ela project is due to be completed by the end of 2020.
It will carry Mahaweli waters to the areas in the Kurunegala district suffering from a severe shortage of water.
The project is implemented under funds from Asian Development Bank. The project is managed by the Mahaweli Water Security and Investment Project.

Well-known thug evading arrest
Horowpathana Police are yet to arrest a well-known thug in the Horowpathana town known as Malu Chooti, who had caused severe injuries to two people in the area during an assault, said the relatives of the victims.
When queried by the media, Horowpathana Police said the suspect was absconding and investigations are in progress to arrest him.
The relatives said Chooti had caused a fracture in the bone of the right leg of 52-year-old M. G. Sooriyaratna Bandara and injured 39-year-old Nihal Karunaratne on his head by assaulting with a club.
Bandara was treated for five days at the Anuradhapura Teaching Hospital while Karunaratne, who had to get five stitches on head, was treated for three days in the same hospital.
The relatives said although 16 days had lapsed following the assault, the suspect had not been arrested yet.
The Police had only arrested those who had allegedly aided and abetted the main suspect.
