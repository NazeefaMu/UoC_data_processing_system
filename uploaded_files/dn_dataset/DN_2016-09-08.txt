CABINET DECISIONS

Control of import and use of asbestos harmful to the environment
Asbestos is used for many products including roofing sheets, floor tiles, cement pipes, brake pads of vehicles, papers and ropes. Since 1987 importation of blue asbestos (Crocidolite) has been prohibited as it was identified as a carcinogen by the World Health Organization (WHO), and currently all kinds of asbestos including white asbestos (Chrysotile) have been identified as carcinogens. About 80% of asbestos imported to Sri Lanka are used for roofing sheet production. Accordingly, the proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to control the use and import of asbestos from 01-01-2018 by adopting more beneficial substitutes and to prepare an operational programme to prohibit asbestos related production by 01-01-2024 with the view to improving the health of the public, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Proper management of polythene use to minimise environmental issues
The use of plastic and polythene related products have increased and improper use, disposal and burning of these products have caused many social, environmental, health and economic issues. Daily per capita use of polythene is about 0.5 kg and about five hundred thousand (500,000) tons of polythene materials are imported to Sri Lanka annually. Some countries have completely prohibited the use of polythene while others have allowed selected plastic products.
Considering the need of controlling environmental impacts caused by polythene and the fact that many employees are engaged in plastic and polythene related industries, the proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to appoint a Committee of Experts to prepare a national policy and an action plan on the use of polythene, plastic and bio-degradable plastic in Sri Lanka, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Declaration of National Marine Resources Conservation week
Disposal of non-degradable pollutants directly or through canals to the ocean, has badly impacted on the marine ecosystem as well as fisheries and tourism industries. Hence, it is required to prepare a regular programme with public participation to protect these ecosystems and the sustainability of their related industries.
Accordingly, the proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to declare the third Saturday to fourth Saturday of September of each year as the National Marine Resources Conservation Week, simultaneous to the International Coastal Cleanup Day falling on the 03rd Saturday of September each year, and to implement coast cleanup and conservation activities within September 17 to 23, 2016 with the participation of the general public, school children and government and non government organizations, and to hold its national celebrations on September 17 at Mattakkuliya coastline in Colombo, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Enforcement and regulation of int. conventions pertaining to wildlife conservation
Sri Lanka has signed several international conventions on wildlife conservation, but the necessary legal provisions have not been enacted to regularise the activities related to those conventions.
Therefore, the proposal made by Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, to amend the Fauna and Flora Protection Ordinance to enable the making of regulations required to implement domestically the international conventions signed by Sri Lanka including Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Implementation of new inland water transport system through private public partnership
It has been identified that an economic and speedy transport system could be introduced through canals and reservoirs where the bus and railway transportation has not been deployed sufficiently in situations where traffic congestion is gradually increasing.
Accordingly, an efficient transportation module could be introduce to connect Colombo East-West and North-South by canals and the sea and Wellawatta - Battaramulla (through canals), Fort-Union Place (across Beira Lake), and Mattakkuliya - Hanwella (through Kelani river) have been identified by the Megapolis Transport Committee as three potential roots.
The proposal made by Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka, to conduct a feasibility study on the above purpose identifying a suitable private investor to establish the water transport system under public-private partnership, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
Construction of Thambalagamuwa Police Station
The Thambalagamuwa Police Station which was established in 2004 is currently situated in two buildings obtained on lease with minimum facilities and about 155 Police Officers are serving at the police station. It was earlier operated as a police post to ensure the protection of people in Muthur, Seruwawila and Trincomalee in the Eastern Province. Accordingly, the proposal made by Law and Order and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake, to construct a new building at an estimated cost of Rs. 90.4 million on a land owned by the Police Department, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.

Its left bank development has been finalised but due to the lack of financial allocations the right bank development has not commenced yet. The proposal made by President Maithripala Sirisena, in his capacity as the Minister of Mahaweli Development and Environment, to implement the above project within 2017-2020 with the view of developing drinking water supply, irrigation, and infrastructure for the socio-economic development in Polonnaruwa and Batticaloa Districts which was affected by the war for decades, was approved by the Cabinet of Ministers.
