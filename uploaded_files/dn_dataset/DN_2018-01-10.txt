Country on journey towards UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection

Minister of Industry and Commerce Rishad Bathiudeen said for the first time in the history of Sri Lankas consumer well-being sphere, Sri Lanka is commencing its journey towards the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection (UNGCP), based on the partnership of two apex Lankan institutions.
The Ministers speech which was read out by a senior official of the ministry at a workshop on Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), organized by the Consumer Affairs Authority of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, in collaboration with the United Nations Industrial Development Organization (UNIDO), noted that Sri Lanka commenced a new journey on consumer well-being with UNGCP as not only a mere response to growing domestic consumer concerns but also due to Sri Lankas strong commitment to consumer well being in partnership with the UN Sustainable Development Goals that the world is aspiring as a community of responsible consumers
The event will continue for five days, before participants finally conclude on the way forward on UNGCP.
This five day session, called as Regulatory Impact Analysis (RIA), focuses on pre-legal, field assessment and evaluation of our national policy of consumer well being and protection that we believe is now ready for major reforms, the minister said adding that, I have no doubts that this is the first time that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, the CAA and even Sri Lanka itself is undertaking such an in-depth review of safeguards of consumption of products, services and compliance at national level, which is a stepping stone for harmonization with dynamic global standards respected by 100 countries.
It is estimated that 100 countries have already used the UN Guidelines on Consumer Protection (UNGCP) for the design of their national consumer safeguard policies.
I am pleased that once these Colombo deliberations are concluded and reform work begins, Sri Lanka too will become part of this huge collective of countries that successfully sourced from UNGCP to design their national consumer well being policy. This effort is of such national importance, we have facilitated the participation of thirty Sri Lankan regulatory bodies in this deliberation to sit together, and such a high level of participation by national regulatory agencies at the same time, is an institutional record of its own for the first time.
The strength of our consumer protection framework at present is largely dependent on legislations such as our Consumer Affairs Authority Act, which need revising. While these Acts introduced the much needed basic consumer safeguard framework to Sri Lanka, they do not appear to be satisfactory anymore in the face of huge changes and complexities in modern consumer trends and dynamics.
According to the Minister, these include online purchases, new cross border consumption patterns including consumption of content such as data, and new consumer activism that looks for remedies on latest merchandise that was previously unheard of or unknown such as streaming or stored online digital content.
For example, 70% of purchases in developed countries today are made online. Rapidly growing Asian countries too are moving fast in the same direction,he added.

Angelo Mathews re-appointed ODI, T20I captain
Hathu played a major part in my captaincy come back
All-rounder Angelo Mathews restored back as captain of the Sri Lanka white balls teams  One-Day International and Twenty20 International said one of the main reasons why he accepted the captaincy again was because of new coach Chandika Hathurusingha.
Hathu played a major part in my comeback to the Sri Lanka captaincy. I have worked with Hathu before he was my A team coach about 10 years ago and he was also the shadow coach when I started playing for the national team. We have a good understanding, said Mathews at a press conference held at SLC yesterday to announce the one-day captain and team.
I know how Hathu operates he is not here to survive. It will be easier for me to work with him because we worked together before. That is one reason why I agreed. Its very important for a team when you have a good strong coach like him. Where all the other countries are dying to have him you know obviously he is the best around, he said.
Mathews quit the Sri Lanka captaincy across all three formats soon after his team had suffered a humiliating 3-2 loss to Zimbabwe in the five-match ODI series for the first time in their history in November last year.
The resignation of head coach Graham Ford after the Champions Trophy also had a great bearing on Mathews resigning as captain as he and Ford had built up a good captain-coach relationship.
When I stepped down I never thought of taking over the captaincy again because when you leave something, you dont look for it again, said Mathews.
But as soon as we came back from India the SLC president had a discussion with me and also Hathurusingha our new coach and selectors had an interaction and requested me to reconsider my decision. I took a few days to think about it. To be honest it wasnt easy because I never expected it in the first place.
I decided to take it for a few reasons. As the president said it was a national call and the other reason was that we need stability running into a World Cup in 18 months time. We had a few captains in the last four months due to so many reasons.
Cricket has given me a lot and if I turned my back in the hour of need Ill be feeling bad in my 10 years of cricket. I stepped down because I wanted the new captain to have enough time to build a team to the World Cup. But again I am down with the responsibility and I will fulfill that working on the same lines with Hathu and try and take on the challenge. I will do what is best for the country and for the team, some may like it some may not but I cant help it, he said.
In response Hathurusingha said, It was a collective decision. My thought is that he is the best person to lead the team, he warrants his place on his own performance. The only concern we had was his physical fitness we have a plan in place to help him.
Mathews who suffered a hamstring tear in the second T20I against India at Indore in December passed a fitness test on Monday to be fit for the Bangladesh tour and be appointed captain for the one-day teams. Mathews has a history of injuries and it has happened whenever he takes on the extra responsibility of bowling in the one-day formats. We have appointed Angelo captain on a long term even after 2019 World Cup. He wont be bowling in Bangladesh because he has just recovered from an injury. Whether he will bowl in the future has to be decided. As long as he stays fit and delivers we will go with him, said chief selector Graham Labrooy.
Mathews explaining his continuous battle with injuries said, We had plenty of discussions with the selectors with the new coach and medical team as well why it has happened and why it keeps happening. The medical experts say that especially from 2013 to 2016 where I never missed a game and I was the only player who played the most number of matches internationally in the world in all three formats was now taking its toll.
The management plan has been discussed. As of now I have stopped bowling in Test matches. It will be handy if I can bowl a few overs in the ODIs and T20Is. But as of now we have to play it by ear. Well do everything possible to try and minimise it but it is out of our control unfortunately. I am doing the best I can and I am taking all the advice from experts but still if you get injured its bad luck.
Mathews was confident that Sri Lanka can change their fortunes with a new coach in the dressing room.
With new coach coming in the atmosphere in the dressing room will be changed. As soon as you give the players the freedom I am pretty sure they will come out with all their positives, said Mathews. We have the skills and we have the talent, we certainly can do it. Its just the thought into the game, playing the situations well will obviously take us through. Today playing against any team is a challenge unlike early times when Bangladesh and Zimbabwe were considered to be minnows, he said.
Coach Hathurusingha said that their aim is to win every game and added, But our goal is to improve that is my main goal to keep improving. If we improve our game I believe that we have the talent to challenge every team. Speaking of the hosts Bangladesh, Hathurusingha said, They have been very strong in the last two years at home. We lost only one series. It will be a challenge for us because they know their conditions very well.
Sri Lanka will compete with Bangladesh and Zimbabwe in the one-day tri-series that begins in Dhaka on January 15.

Residents in the Kurunegala area had foiled an attempt to abduct a pre-school child returning home with her grandmother after school. The 3  year old child is living under the custody of her father, in the Wilgodawatte area in Kurunegala.
According to CCTV footage recorded on a nearby camera, the child was returning home with her grandmother when an unidentified man had tried to grab the child, but as he had tripped, bystanders were able to rescue the child.
According to the father of the child, although a complaint had been lodged with the police regarding the abduction, he claims no action had been taken to arrest the suspects, despite CCTV footage.
It is believed that the abduction is based on a family dispute. The police media unit said investigations are being conducted by the Police Crimes Division and those responsible were asked to surrender or face arrest.

Ayurvedic doctors seek Army leadership training
Adding a new dimension and recognition to the training skills and capabilities of Army professionals, a few more than 640 new Ayurvedic medical practitioners (new physicians) of the Department of Ayurveda on January 8, began a six-day residential training on Leadership Skills and Development of Positive Attitudes in five separate Army establishments.
Considered as one more contribution to the nation-building aspirations of the Commander of the Army, the project got underway simultaneously at islandwide Army training schools in Diyatalawa, Kalatthewa, Minneriya, Embilipitiya and Buwelikada after brief inaugural ceremonies at respective places.
The six-day training programme largely focuses on Promotion of Leadership Skills and Qualities, Moulding of Social Discipline, Development of Vocational Skills, Preparedness to Overcome Challenges in Life, Generating of Correct Social Expectations, Conduct of Professional Guide and Mental Equilibrium among the attendees.
Commander of the Army, Lieutenant General Mahesh Senanayake, in response to a request made by the Ministry of Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine to the Ministry of Defence, has instructed Director General Training, Major General Vijitha Ravipriya, at the Army Headquarters, to facilitate the request.
Arrangements were put in place at those five main Army training centres, Marksmanship and Sniper Training School at Diyatalawa, Armoured Corps Training School, Kalaththewa, School of Artillery, Minneriya, School of Military Engineers, Embilipitiya and School of Signals, Boowelikada, under the supervision of respective commandants. This project coincides with the Commanders conceptual notion that the Army should devote one-third of its dedication for nation-building tasks with the objective of supporting civil administration, in whatever way possible. A team of instructors of the Army would continue with lectures until January 12 before the final closing ceremony gets underway.
Senior officers and representatives of the Department of Ayurveda and Health Ministry officials were also present during inaugural ceremonies at those five main Army training centres. A similar training project for Samurdhi officials a few weeks ago ended successfully, for which President Maithripala Senanayake also extended greetings while he was in Polonnaruwa.

Badge of courage Isipathana College
Those that have worked under Head Boy of Isipathana Janith Pasindu know the kind of boundless energy that he possesses. And the fervor he can inspire in his followers. Perfect Prefects features Janith Pasindu who can rally those under him to pursue any dream no matter how difficult it may seem at first and then lead them to victory. Because your dreams are so special and valuable.
Pasindu points out that he is an admirer of Che Guevara, saying that it is the attitude, determination and bravery of Che that he admires. Possibly it is Ches capacity to dream that really inspires this love Pasindu has for him. Che had this tremendous youthful vigor that enabled him to pursue his dreams. And as mentioned before chasing after dreams is Pasindus specialty. If necessary he will devote his entire life to it!
Magnitude
As a leader directing a large student body, the first thing I do is take the correct decisions at the right time, by planning the outcome beforehand. Yes its a big challenge but I have got a lot of patience. The magnitude of the problem does not bother me. What I do is delegate responsibilities and then lead them to success, said Pasindu.
Pasindus forte is his optimism. Problems do not discourage him. He faces his problems by simply being organized.
My game plan is very simple but effective. Firstly I try hard to understand the problem as fast as I can. Secondly I try solve it myself. If that fails, I ask elder people such as parents and teachers. Then I examine other angles and look at other ways to solve the problem. Then I choose the best way to solve it, stated Pasindu.
Isipathana a fiercely competitive school has taught him how to be brave and how to be disciplined. It has brought him to the place where he is now. Sri Lanka is not enough for this youngster. He has set his sights on the world.
Future ambition
I would like to make a difference in this competitive world by making a considerable change in myself first. I am going to change the attitudes of men because the attitudes of people are the major and the most successful method of changing the world to becoming a better place. My future ambition is to be a biotech engineer and my ultimate goal is to initiate biotech companies using my knowledge and leadership skills and become a worthy citizen to my country, pointed out Pasindu.
Pasindu sees the world in a crisis. He points out that one major problem in the world is environmental pollution such as garbage problems. He wants to use his leadership skills to address this issue. No doubt his leadership skills are honed through the activities he has taken part in at school.
Yes of course. I participate in every event at the sports meet because participating is as valuable as winning. And I also participate in the inter school gymnastic tournaments where I have won a lot of trophies. Sports is not just winning its a mixture of discipline, courage, leadership and cooperation with others, argued Pasindu.
Determination
Pasindu believes in overcoming ones problems and not trying to escape from them. He feels that you should fight as strongly as possible and never give up when it comes to achieving your goals. Pasindu believes in facing the challenges with courage and determination while not forgetting to listen to others. He believes in serving his country with honor. Listening to Pasindu talk one sees a lot of Che Guevara in him.
Pasindus favorite movies are Never Back Down and The Pursuit of Happiness. The Pursuit of Happiness is a story which inspires you to pursue your dreams no matter what others say, and protect it. The best book he has ever read is As a Man Thinketh. It is a classic which explains how your thoughts mold your personality and how your personality drives you to take actions and determines the kind of choices you take.
He also dreams of traveling to Rome and soak up the culture. Pasindu is a true fan of aesthetics and admires the elegance and artistry of Italy.
He thanks his parents for helping him get over the hardships in his life and also his principal, teachers and friends for standing by him and helping him to get where he is today. Again dream as big as you want!

## Title: A bit more about Bitcoin

A bit more about Bitcoin
Like the Tulip Mania of the early 17th Century and countless other speculative economic bubbles, Bitcoin underwent a major correction last week after reaching an astounding 19,850 US dollars earlier in December of last year. But what really is Bitcoin And why is it the talk of the town
It would be fair to say that most people are left bewildered by the very concept of digital currencies, primarily because it involves understanding a new tech-savvy paradigm. However, at its foundational level, cryptocurrencies  as they are dubbed  are not altogether very different from the idea of tangible money.
The original cryptocurrency has been a lot in the news lately but what is it and do digital currencies have a future
A cryptocurrency is a virtual currency which is encrypted and anonymous, making it secure and hard to track. It has no physical manifestation and exists only as a unique string of numbers and characters in the memory of computers. These currencies are traded on online exchanges only geared towards cryptocurrencies.
Bitcoin was the first cryptocurrency which was started in 2009 by an anonymous group or person who go/goes by the name of Satoshi Nakomoto, who vanished from the online community in 2010.
What makes Bitcoin unique is that unlike conventional currencies, no central bank or government issues cryptocurrencies and it is not legal tender  you cannot use it to pay your taxes for example. Instead the value and volume of transactions all depend on the community that trades in them. Like physical currencies, however, digital currencies are backed by trust. Whereas paper currencies require their users to trust that national state banks will stand by the value invested in them, cryptocurrencies require a more dispersed form of trust  that their algorithm will prevent fraud and in the demand and supply from other users.
New Bitcoins
Bitcoin can also be used anonymously since unlike credit cards or a bank account, there is no associated address or ID registered with your Bitcoin account  and this is all part of the appeal of cryptocurrencies. However, Bitcoin isnt as anonymous as its fans and suspicious authorities state  it can be possibly traced to you through your IP address, service provider or spending patterns for instance.
There are currently 16.78 million Bitcoins in circulation with a limited number of new Bitcoins added every day. And anyone with a high-powered computer and some know-how can obtain these. Bitcoins are mined by powerful algorithm-crunching computers which discover new bitcoins  essentially the solving of complex mathematical puzzles through computing power. These are, in turn, validated by the blockchain  a virtual grid containing nodes representing users that act as the collective validation system. Think of every Bitcoin transaction as a bank account entry, but instead of the transaction being verified by the two transacting parties, it is recorded and verified by the whole community at once removing any chance of fraud.
Unfortunately, mining Bitcoins requires a lot of electric power. According to a report by PowerCompare, [Mining Bitcoins] exceeded the energy consumption of 159 countries around the world. According to Digiconomist, it takes 29.05 TWh (terawatt hours, equal to one million megawatt hours) annually to operate the energy-hungry computers and networks that power bitcoin transactions. Furthermore according to the Bitcoin Energy Consumption Index, 10 US households can be powered for a day by the energy consumed by a single Bitcoin transaction.
In China, there are server farms that are taking in more energy than whole cities for mining Bitcoins. The energy required to mine these currencies simply is not sustainable in the long term.
Is Bitcoin and cryptocurrency the future of money
The biggest hurdle for Bitcoin is that regulators and governments are reluctant to recognise it. Very few real world merchants accept it so far and transactions are cumbersome. Its mysterious origins dont help its reputation much. For many digital elites, part of the appeal of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies is the lack of hurdles and overbearing regulation. Most governments around the world, however, have banned cryptocurrencies in some form or the other, Japan being the standout exception which has legalised it.
For US authorities, Bitcoin is simply a way to evade regulation. According to Ben Bernanke, the former head of the US Federal Reserve Bitcoin is an attempt to replace fiat currency and evade regulation and government intervention. I dont think thats going to be a success. Its also worth mentioning that no central banks or international financial institution offer it as of now.
However, the US government doesnt seem to be following its own advice: recently the Federal Reserve of America announced that it would be launching a cryptocurrency of its own in due time.
The Pakistan government has also outlawed cryptocurrency and the State Bank of Pakistans official stance is that it does not intend to legalise bitcoins or cryptocurrencies in the future. However, this hasnt stopped an underground exchange of cryptocurrencies from mushrooming in Pakistan. One can trade in Bitcoins on websites, Facebook and WhatsApp among other mediums.
Cryptocurrency exchanges
China initially promoted Bitcoin before banning all Initial Coin Offerings or ICOs which led to panic in the cryptocurrency exchanges. Initial Coin Offerings are the cryptocurrency equivalent of Initial Public Offerings or IPOs.
Instead of equity shares, however, buyers get virtual coins of a soon-to-be-issued cryptocurrency for a pre-set value. Despite its own dire warnings that unregulated cryptocurrencies could threaten global financial stability, however, the Peoples Bank of China too announced at the end of December that it had set up a team to design its own sovereign cryptocurrency.
Obviously, the flexibility of digital currencies still carries appeal.
The Pakistan government has also outlawed cryptocurrency and the State Bank of Pakistans official stance is that it does not intend to legalise bitcoins or cryptocurrencies in the future. However, this hasnt stopped an underground exchange of cryptocurrencies from mushrooming in Pakistan. One can trade in Bitcoins on websites, Facebook and WhatsApp among other mediums.
The other hurdle for Bitcoin is its volatility. Although initially put forward as an eventual global substitute for sovereign currency, speculation saw its value jump more than 1900 percent in 2017  at the beginning of the year its value was a mere 1,000 dollars  only to fall to below 12,000 dollars and then recover to around 15,000 dollars in a matter of days in December. As of last Tuesday morning, it was valued at 13,669 dollars. As any economist will point out, such wild fluctuations do not make for a currency that can be a viable financial substitute. Money works best when it can hold its value and consumers can rely on it to know how much they are paying for something.
While we arent seeing a full acceptance for Bitcoin or other related currencies anytime soon, it seems that they are here to stay. The market capitalisation for cryptocurrencies as of December 2017 was 600 billion dollars and according to some it will head to the one trillion dollar mark. We may even be looking at a permanent grey area where Bitcoins become the currency equivalent of downloads. Just like torrents, another peer-to-peer (or p2p) sharing technology, Bitcoin might in the future remain on the margins and be used by people who are interested in technology but chased down by regulators and governments.

Central Bank to promote adoption of PADSS
The Central Bank is taking steps not only to strengthen the cyber security of the Central Bank but also to ensure that the core systems of banks and other financial institutions are also rigorously safeguarded as cyber security is a threat to the stability and credibility of our financial sector.
In this regard, the Central Bank is promoting the adoption of the Payment Application Data Security Standard (PADSS) for payment applications that may come into operation in the future. We will mandate real-time SMS/e-mail alerts for transactions made through debit/credit cards, internet banking and mobile phone based banking, Governor Central Bank, Indrajit Coomaraswamy said at the launch of the 2018 Road Map.
With a view to strengthening the financial intelligence environment, we will continue to coordinate with the stakeholders to develop Anti-Money Laundering and Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/CFT) policies to implement the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) recommendations more effectively. Actions will be taken to amend/repeal Financial Transactions Reporting Act No 6 of 2006 (FTRA) and Prevention of Money Laundering Act, No. 05 of 2006 (PMLA) in line with international recommendations. We will also facilitate and coordinate with stakeholders to amend the Mutual Assistance in Criminal Matters Act (MACMA), NGO Act and Trust Ordinance.
Two-factor authentication will be adopted for Point of Sales (POS) transactions, internet banking as well as all on-line and mobile third-party fund transfers.
The Central Bank is in the process of acquiring a dynamic state of the art Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system for facilitating and monitoring of real time large value fund transfers for the participating institutions.
In order to safeguard customers and the financial system as a whole and to ensure smooth operations of mobile phone based e-money systems, the Central Bank will continue its on-site and off-site supervision of these systems.
To enable a secure channel for e-commerce trading and internet payment gateways, the Central Bank, as the regulator, will continuously monitor and provide guidance in the form of standards for e-commerce trading service providers in order to safeguard the interests of the general public.

Sri Lanka pick uncapped fast bowler Shehan Madushanka
Chandimal, Kusal Mendis back in ODI squad
Sri Lanka cricket selectors recalled batsmen Dinesh Chandimal and Kusal Mendis and named uncapped 22-year-old right-arm fast-medium bowler Shehan Madushanka in their 17-member one-day team for the Tri-Nation Series in Bangladesh later this month.
Chandimal the Sri Lanka Test captain and Mendis, one of the brightest batting prospects of Sri Lanka were left out of the one-day series against India due to poor form.
By recalling them for the Bangladesh tour, chief selector Graeme Labrooy said, We have a short term, medium term and long term plan. Chandimal is for the long term plan that we are building. Chandimal had played over 100 ODIs and he has scored good hundreds and has a good strike rate.
The presence of the new coach coming and working with him he has shown a lot of intent and even in the last two Tests he played in India he played a little more aggressively. With a few technical changes in the last ten days he has been matching upto the strike rates of other batsmen. We are backing the coach who feels that Chandimal is essential to the team in the long term.
On the selection of Mendis, Labrooy said, Kusal has gone back to club cricket and got some big runs. We think he is ready to make a comeback. The new captain and coach believe in him a lot.
I am very happy to be back in the ODI team once again, said Chandimal. The coach has placed a lot of trust in me. I have played very well in ODIs only last year my form dropped. I think my best years are ahead of me and I hope to finish my career on a high.
Whilst naming the squad the national selectors also re-appointed Angelo Mathews captain of the ODI and T20I teams.
Explaining the inclusions of uncapped fast bowler Madushanka who has played only 3 first-class matches and 3 List A games and, spinner Wanindu Hasaranga, Labrooy, a former fast bowler said, Madushanka has pace he averages 135 plus and bowls a quicker ball at 140 plus thats the main reason, and we are looking at pace. He is a long term investment. We were looking at (Jeffrey) Vandersay but he had an injury and has not played cricket in the last six weeks so we brought Hasaranga into the squad. He has been selected after the new coach and captain had a look at him.
Hasaranga, the 20-year-old leg-spinner made a dream debut against Zimbabwe at Galle last year becoming only the third debutant in ODI history to claim a hat-trick.
When you go to a World Cup we need at least 6-7 fast bowlers although we may select only four. They should have played at least 20 ODIs minimum otherwise they should be in the system with us, said coach Hathurusingha. Madushanka has the potential to bowl fast. In England we saw at the Champions trophy how tahe ICC prepares wickets they dont prepare English type of wickets but good batting tracks. To be competitive we have taken Madushanka who will be good enough.
The tri-series starts on January 15 in Dhaka with Sri Lanka, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe battling for honours.

Dear Children, Sincerely  Seven decades of Sri Lanka is a highly charged ensemble performance that takes you on a journey back through seventy years of Sri Lanka, highlighting seven singular events that changed the course of Sri Lankan history irrevocably.
Created through conversations conducted with the generation born in the 1930s, the play traces and links the dramatic socio political twists and turns of the Sri Lankan people, from Independence in the 1940s through to the end of a 30-year Civil War in 2009.
This performance is part of the wider Dear Children, Sincerely Project (DCS Project), a research and theatre project begun in 2015 by Stages Theatre Group in Sri Lanka.
The DCS project began with the purpose of encouraging senior citizens to look back critically and reflectively on their countrys journey in order to try and understand it in retrospect, whilst targeting youth audiences to engage in these narratives.

China offers 10-year visas  to 'high end talent'
China is issuing long-term visas to lure highly skilled people from abroad to work in the country.
The multi-entry visas will be valid for between five and 10 years, according to state media.
Technology leaders, entrepreneurs and scientists from in-demand sectors are among those eligible to apply.
China has set out goals for its economic and social development, and sees recruiting experts from abroad as key to achieving that.
When plans for the scheme were first considered, China said at least 50,000 foreigners would benefit.
Applications for the visas can be made online, are free of charge and will be processed quickly, the Chinese government said.
Visa holders will be allowed to remain in the country for up to 180 days at a time, and will be eligible to bring partners and children.
In 2016 China introduced a ranking system for expatriates, aimed at identifying the skills it wanted to attract while reducing the number of lower-skilled foreigners coming into the country.
According to a document from the Chinese government, those classed as "high-end foreign talent" included Nobel Prize winners, successful Olympic athletes and directors of "world famous colleges of music fine arts and arts".
Top scientists, heads of major financial institutions and professors of "overseas high-level universities" also fit the bill.
The visas would also be granted to the spouses and children of the high-end recipients.
China implements a strict immigration system and tightly controls the issuing of work visas.
Most foreigners working in China must renew their visas every one or two years.
The new visas are meant to expand the pool of foreign specialists working in China, particularly in the areas such as science and technology, which Beijing sees as key to driving economic growth.
According to government guidelines, high-end foreigners also refer to, among others, Nobel Prize winners, chief or deputy editors in Chinese state media, foreign coaches and players in national and provincial sports teams, postdoctoral students from world-class universities outside China, and foreigners who earn at least six times the average annual wage in China.
The average annual income in Beijing in 2016 was 92,477 yuan (US$14,220), according to official statistics.
The visas are part of a top-down drive to make China a more attractive place to work and stay.
In February 2016, the central government relaxed the countrys green card rules, extending eligibility for permanent residency to foreigners working in broader fields than just government departments or laboratories involved in key national projects.
Of all the provincial-level areas in China, Shanghai has the highest number of foreign workers, with about 215,000 of the citys 24 million people coming from overseas.
A third of those overseas workers are employed in the business service sector, according to local authorities. In 2016, Japan was the biggest source of foreign workers in Shanghai, followed by the United States and South Korea.

Beware health hazards!
Food is a vital necessity for the survival of the human beings. It is indispensable for all living beings. The media highlights the plight of people walking many kilometres to fetch water.
They have a bath once a month only! People in the urban areas are gifted with pipe-borne water.
We find that there are so many poultry farms, piggery, dairy and cattle farms (buffaloes) and goat farms close to residential areas and these cause untold misery to people living in the area. The nuisance of the foul smell, the fly and mosquito menace is beyond anybody's expression. Dengue is rampant in these areas!
In Kandy District, especially the rural and abandoned tea estate sector, there are many poultry farms which use the water from streams close by what the villagers below use for drinking and bathing purposes. These cause the misery of health problems. No doubt big time branded farms are located in places where it is not a problem to the masses and are well maintained and every care taken to maintain cleanliness unlike the farms in the rural sector amongst human dwellings.
It is high time that the health authorities take steps to locate the farms that are a health hazard to the people to marked locations so that the masses in these areas are protected against dengue, fly and mosquito menace and make the water pure for drinking and bathing purposes.
Also invariably, the lorries come late in the night to collect these birds and the peace and sleep disturbed of the people living in the area. The deep-litter is thrown in the vicinity developing a breeding ground for fly and mosquitoes. These must be stopped and the health authorities should take appropriate action to streamline these farms so that there are no health hazard issues.

Corrupt people talking about Bond report - Rajitha
It is hilarious to see people who were involved in large-scale corruption talking about Central Bank bond issue commission report, Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne said.
According to Minister Senaratne, during the past, there were several commissions but no report issued by those commissions. The Prime Minister gave evidence before the Bond Commission and was cleared by the commission.
Minister Senaratne was addressing the gathering during a meeting held at Beruwala recently.
The Minister said the same law implemented for ordinary people was implemented for the Prime Minister and this is the difference between past commissions and this commission. During the time of late Prime Minister S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, four Cabinet Ministers were sacked and their civic rights were removed because they were found guilty of taking bribes.
A total of Rs. 4,370 million had been spent for the development of the Beruwala electorate in the recent past which is a first.
The carpeting of 10 roads in the electorate will commence next week and all families in the electorate will receive pipe-borne drinking water by 2020. Jobs have been provided to 6,000 youths in the Kalutara district, he added.

These days food is a quite popular object to photograph. Instagram and Facebook are full of people sharing their meals every day. Michele Baldini from Mexico is one of those guys who shares his breakfast with the world, the only difference is that theres no doubt his account is worth a follow!
The food artist uses only eggs to create amazing things with his spatula  from pop culture references and landscapes to recreations of famous artworks, such as Van Goghs Starry Night.
It looks like playing with your food is actually a good thing. Using the same canvas for each photo - a black frying pan - each of Baldinis posts features an incredible image comprised using his favourite medium only - fried eggs.
According to Baldini, the idea started with a simple fried egg Yin Yang symbol and has grown from there.
And although he has experimented with other foods, fried eggs are his favourite. Elaborate and incredibly detailed, the egg-based designs are impressive - and way too beautiful to eat. Take a closer look for a life-changing eggsperience!

Dignity burned to a cinder
During the height of partys internal crisis; and after being prematurely thrown out of power by Chandrika Kumaratunga, leading to an electoral loss in early April, the United National Party decided to hold its the May Day celebrations in Jaffna in 2004.
Chief Opposition Whip John Amaratunga in a statement on April 23, stated, The government plans to disrupt the Joint Opposition May Day rally in Jaffna,
The statement further said; the government and its friendly forces within the UNP have been working to see that the Jaffna rally would not be successful, and that the party was determined to make it otherwise. What sort of dismal depths, a dominant political might in the country can be fallen to; for a senior stalwart to declare: Government friendly forces within their party.
However, the truth remained that, being incapable of facing the mainstream membership of which the majority are supporters of the anti-leader faction, the leader and his inner circle planned an excursion to the North, seeking the assistance of the Tamil National Alliance. John Amarathunga added that other parties had pledged their participation. He did not substantiate his claim by naming them. Presumably, they were, the Dr Wickramabahu group, Sirithunga, Manamendra, and Mujibarr Rahaman group, whos participatory strengths were well understood.
Premadasa Commemoration rally
As reported in the media, the anti-leader faction was having on their own a Premadasa Commemoration rally in Colombo which falls on May 1 too, in the afternoon on May 1, a deviation from the usual morning ceremony held every year; and their unusual rush for sophisticated arrangements organised well ahead of time, all adding up to the doubt created in the minds of the public on their motives and covert agenda as well. They said it is nothing but an act of destruction to the Party that the leader and the deputy have indulged in; it was against not only the Grand Old Party but the nation as a whole; they, in fact, saw the unfortunate act as a creation of two separate states with Colombo and Jaffna as capitals.
Worse, their actions provided a free-hand to the CBK-Mahinda government to continue their picnic at the cost of the nation.
Amarathungas statement further stated that the UNP has made arrangements to ensure the participation of 100 supporters from each electorate. Leaving the north and east out, there were approximately 120 electorates, making it a total of 12,000 people. The ideal, the organisers thought was to have a special train leaving Polgahawela.
The government supporters used the opportunity to remind them that their leader can commemorate the UNP governments great excursion of 1981 to conduct the Jaffna DC elections, which was carried out under the supervision of two senior ministers and the then leader.
The 1981 drama contemptuously called They came from Colombo, left half of the Northern city in flames, Jaffna TULF MP Yogeswarans house was torched. Biblioclasm in one of Asias best libraries with 96,000 books and ancient manuscripts, disruption and rigging of DC elections with ballot boxes finding their way to the Subash Hotel. Just the main parts of the drama or atrocities committed by the Police, assisted by the trainload of state-sponsored Sinhala hooligans from South.
Hence, the move to visit the Northern city was hailed by many as one of the current leaders thought-provoking and progressive acts and an ideal opportunity for the UNP and Party leader to make a belated confession before the people of this nation on behalf of his former seniors giving into narrow and traditional mindsets. Perhaps he wanted to do it from the very place the past leaders committed the crime years ago.
Rational thinking politicians
Let me quote here just two excerpts, out of a long list, for lack of space; which the present leadership of not only the UNP but all other rational thinking politicians could take serious note of.
1. President J R Jayewardene was interviewed by S. Venkat Narayan, senior editor India Today on Sep 15, 1981  as reported on its page 18.
Narayan In Jaffna, people are very upset. Policemen set fire to the library and burnt 96,000 books. They also set fire to a TULF MPs house.
JRJ  Thats because they think he is in touch with the terrorists.
Narayan  It seems they were trying to catch him (the MP) so they could kill him.
JRJ  Terrorists do that too.
2. Parliamentary Debates June 9, 1981, Hansard-Col. 155-156.
V. Yogeswaran  MP Jaffna:-- Mr Deputy Speaker, I was telling this house about the incidents of the 31st ..I could see the flicker of flames from the bazaar area. My wife told me, I think they will attack our house. I was an MP who was elected by the people and lived with them. I tried to contact the District Minister. told his secretary, that the police are burning some portions of the town. (Laughter - government benches).
Mr Deputy Speaker, while they are laughing the whole world is laughing at them! You have burnt a part of the great city and you show nothing but your derisive laughter! Those who read this Hansard will look down upon you.
National Integration and Reconciliation Week-
Last year the Cabinet of Ministers declared this week, from January 8 to the 14, as National Integration and Reconciliation Week to coincide with the second anniversary of the Presidential election of January 8, 2015, and this was the first occasion on which this annual National Integration and Reconciliation Week was observed in Sri Lanka.
One of the main features of this Observance, a Pledge for National Integration and Reconciliation was read out on January 9th in schools and state institutions including in Parliament, -resolving to work together, hand in hand, while respecting the richness of our diversity, to foster peace, understanding, mutual trust, and brotherhood; a new Sri Lanka united in its diversity.
Although the 30-year war ended in May 2009, the healing of wounds of over three decades of conflict, achieving national integration, reconciliation, catching up on economic development and development that got away from us due to conflict, and guaranteeing of non-recurrence, remain challenging responsibilities for our Nation.

TITLE: A DECADE IN THE VILLAGE
Author: Mahinda Jayaweera
Mahinda Jayaweeras nostalgic novel A Decade in the Village is set in the backdrop of postsecond world war Sri Lanka, then Ceylon. As Dr Leel Gunasekera in his very perceptive foreword to the first edition of the book says, Jayaweera writes in a fascinating narrative style unique to the writer. He takes the reader through an idyllic rural world which is comparatively humane and strife-free.
A Decade in the Village features a wide variety of social contexts characters located in a particular place, Parakgama in the Kegalle district, spanning a period before and after independence, in fact, a decade. Though classified as a novel, the book is a composite of several narratives, each revolving around a particular character, woven into a strand which conveys deep insight into a way of life now drastically changed. Prof. Siri Hettige observes that this work borders on the well-established tradition of ethnographic studies of village life in the country as it enables the reader to understand the specific context within a wider spectrum of things, places and times.
Vital role
The novel begins with the coming of Lawrence, the English teacher to the village school. It is a significant event as he plays a vital role not only in developing the plot of the novel but also in communicating through his impressions and reactions, the seemingly simple but subtle inter-relations of this closely knit society. There are no large-scale conflicts or confrontations, but as to be expected with any human grouping there are frictions and these are observed with sympathy and humour. Lawrence represents in a way the colonial residual but the centrality of his character gives insight into the value system of the society.
His empathy and kindness, the singleness of his commitment to the causes of the village make the village embrace him as a friend. He makes the sorrows of the villagers his own, their joys are his own. He fails twice in love, both instances through betrayal but stands solid and firm. Mahinda Jayaweera weaves into his main character the deeply ingrained concepts of metta and upeksha.
Authority and influence
Village life is projected both vertically and horizontally in the novel. The era he writes about is a period of change as Prof. Hettige observes. It still has residues not only of colonialism but also feudalism. The hierarchical order of the village is realistically presented. The Ratemahmaya, the Weda Ralahamy the Headmaster play dominant roles in the village and their authority and influence are conveyed with understanding and without rancour.
At the bottom level are ordinary men and women. Jinadasa and Sediris who boast about their war experience, Holman who could narrate fiction like the truth. Horizontally the characters represent a cross-section of village lifefeudal overlords, government servants, businessmen from the lowlands, village artistes, cultivators and sundry hangers on-Mahinda Jayaweeras world is rich in diversity.
What recommends the novel is not only this diversity and range, in fact, it comprises ethnic and language diversity because he talks of Tamils from Jaffna and Muslims as well, but the sincerity and understanding he conveys through the novel  the utter decency if one can use the word.
Literal snatch
Life at Parakgama is ideal. There is no hatred or violence, There are of course the weaknesses of the humans. Sirimal, supposed friend of Lawrence literally snatches the girl he hopes to marry. He comes closest to a villain in the novel. But he does not. He reforms after marriage. Lawrence does not bear any grudge. He picks up the threads of his life and moves on. Life continues undisturbed, unfettered.

The human touch is an important part of the life of elephants that infest on either sides of Buttala Katharagama road.
Since the road users feed them frequently, the elephants seek eatables from the moving vehicles sometimes causing panic in certain passengers. However, due to the tame nature of these elephants most passengers in moving vehicles stop by to offer eatables to them.

Englands under-fire Bayliss to step down after 2019 Ashes
Sydney: England coach Trevor Bayliss will step down after the next Ashes series in 2019, he announced on Tuesday as the media slammed him over the 4-0 Test thrashing in Australia.
Bayliss, who was appointed in 2015 to succeed the sacked Peter Moores, said it would be time for a fresh approach when his four-year contract comes to an end.
Im contracted to September 2019 and that will see me out, the 55-year-old Australian told the BBC. Ive always felt that its time for a change around that four-year mark. A new voice and a different approach reinvigorates things.
The broadcaster said Bayliss told England director of cricket Andrew Strauss of his plans a year ago, but had only now made it public.
His contract takes him up to the end of the 2019 Ashes series, when Australia coach Darren Lehmann also plans to call it quits. Since former Sri Lanka coach Bayliss took over from Moores, Englands Test results have been mixed, losing 18 and winning 15. His announcement follows Englands chastening 4-0 Ashes defeat, with Australia recording four comprehensive wins -- including two innings victories and a 10-wicket triumph.
British media criticised Bayliss after Mondays loss in the fifth and final Test in Sydney, with the Daily Telegraph accusing him of being laissez-faire.
Among Englands Ashes low-points, vice-captain Ben Stokes was suspended before the tour pending an investigation into a nightclub brawl, and wicketkeeper Jonny Bairstow drew controversy when he greeted Australias Cameron Bancroft with a headbutt in a Perth Bar.
The laissez-faire approach of England coach Trevor Bayliss has spelled disaster in Australia, headlined the Daily Telegraph, which added: Bayliss presided over a walloping that would bring the guillotine rolling through the streets in other big team sports.
England have little chance of improving if they stick with Trevor Bayliss, said the Evening Standard, while the Independent asked: What is the point of Trevor Bayliss. AFP

EX Navy Spokesman, five others granted bail
Former Navy Spokesman Commodore D.K.P Dassanayake and five others who were held in remand custody for over six months were granted bail under strict conditions by the Colombo High Court yesterday.
They were remanded on the charge of aiding and abetting the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths in 2008 and 2009 were yesterday ordered to be released.
Each suspect was ordered to be released on a cash bail of Rs.100,000 with three sureties of Rs 1 million. They were severely warned not to interfere with witnesses in the case and further ordered to appear before the CID every Saturday.
Colombo High Court Judge Manilal Waidyatilleke made this order after taking into consideration a revision application filed by the suspects challenging the Colombo Fort Magistrates decision to reject bail on the suspects on several occasions.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appearing for the CID raised objections to release D.K.P. Dassanayake and three others on bail citing that CID investigative officers had received death threats.
Presidents Counsel Anil de Silva appearing for the suspects informed court that the prosecution was making baseless allegations without evidence. The Magistrates Court had earlier refused to grant bail on the suspects citing that there is no exceptional circumstances to release the suspects on bail.
On July 12, the CID arrested the former Navy Spokesman at the Sri Lanka Navy base in Welisara following an investigation into the incident. The missing persons had been abducted by an unidentified group at Dehiwala, Battaramulla and Wattala in 2008 and 2009.

Fast bowling  at its best
The two Test matches that ran concurrently with each other  the fifth Ashes Test between Australia and England at Sydney and the first Test between the top two ranked Test teams India and South Africa at Newlands, Cape Town produced some of the finest fast bowling in contemporary cricket. All these bowlers hit the 140k plus speed limits and made life extremely difficult for the batsmen unless of course the nature of the pitch slowed them down.
On a pitch that is renowned to help spin, Australian fast bowlers Mitchell Starc, Josh Hazlewood and Pat Cummins took 14 of the 20 wickets in the second innings to subject England to an innings and 123 runs defeat and to hand Australia a comprehensive 4-0 win of the series and with it the Ashes which they regained after two years.
Michael Clarkes team had lost it to England in 2015 by a 3-2 margin, but Steve Smith led his team from the front to recapture the Ashes in the subsequent series making a personal contribution of 687 runs off his own bat (avg. 137.40) with a top score of 239 out of his three centuries. Smith was the biggest stumbling block for England as they strived to run through the Australian batting time and again thwarting their attempts with telling contributions with the bat that has taken his career average to 63.75 which is second only to the great Sir Donald Bradmans 99.94.
Batting around Smith were the Marsh brothers Shaun and Mitchell whose contributions really pushed England to the point of no return. What a proud moment it would have been for their father Geoff Marsh, the former Australian opener and coach when both his sons made hundreds in the Sydney Test.
Geoff if one may recall was coach of the Sri Lankan team in 2012 but his two-year contract with Sri Lanka Cricket was shockingly terminated after just four months that led to Geoff taking legal action against SLC who had to pay him a substantial amount. It was during Geoffs short tenure that Sri Lanka secured their maiden Test victory in South Africa at Durban.
If Smith was the key to Australias success with the bat, then the bowling honours was shared by the three seamers Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins and off-spinner Nathan Lyon each of them finishing the series with over 20 wickets apiece. Those figures proved that Australia did not rely on just one or two bowlers for their success but the wickets were distributed equally amongst the quartet of bowlers that Smith had at his disposal. It is rarely that one finds four bowlers taking over 20 wickets in a series which proves how much the bowlers understood each others roles.
How much did England miss the all-round contributions of their vice-captain Ben Stokes is a matter of conjecture. Would the result of the series been different had Stokes played England were left to ponder on these questions after leaving the all-rounder out on disciplinary grounds where he is facing a police inquiry into an alleged brawl outside a Bristol pub.
On the other side of the continent another battle between fast bowlers and batsmen took place at Newlands where South Africa emerged winners by 72 runs against a fighting Indian outfit whose strong batting line-up failed to cope with the brilliant bowling of Vernon Philander who moved the ball both ways to cause considerable damage to their innings on both occasions.
A target of 208 on a pitch offering plenty for the fast bowlers was always going to be challenging and testing and the Indian batsmen proved they were not upto the mark to counter the South African pace attack which was without an injured Dale Steyn in the second innings.
Indias batsmen had proved vulnerable to the moving ball during the first Test against Sri Lanka at Eden Gardens Kolkata last November when Suranga Lakmal along with Lahiru Gamage and Dasun Shanaka had bundled them out for 172 on a green pitch under overcast conditions.
Here, against a quality fast bowling attack that had Philander, Rabada, Steyn and Morne Morkel, Indias batting was found to be wanting. Although the sun shone the pitch had a lot to offer the bowlers after being under covers the entire third day due to rain.
In Steyns absence Philander took on the responsibility and stood up to bowl his country to a creditable win with a career best performance of 6 for 42 on a fourth day pitch that saw 18 wickets fall for 195 runs in 64 overs. In actual fact it was a three-day Test as the third day was washed out without a ball bowled.
It was a Test match dominated by the fast bowlers with the South African pace quartet picking up all 20 Indian wickets and likewise Indias quartet of fast-medium bowlers Mohammad Shami, Bhuvneshwar Kumar, Jasprit Bumrah and Hardik Pandya capturing 17 wickets. The spinners hardly had any say in the Test with Ravichandran Ashwin bowling just 8.1 overs in the entire match and South African left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj ten.
India had their moments in the Test when they reduced South Africa to 12-3 in the first innings and 130 all out in the second after being 66-2. However it was their batting overall that let them down.
If not for Pandyas counter-attacking knock of 93 off 95 balls that lifted India from a despairing 92-7 to 209 in the first innings, South Africa would have simply run away with the Test. In the second innings no one really stood up for India and the target of 208 seemed a distance dream.
However the three-Test series is poised for an interesting contest with India, the no. 1 ranked Test side expected to bounce back in the next two Tests scheduled to be played at the Centurion and Johannesburg.

Federation cautions against contestants with criminal records
The Lanka Federation of Self National Employees yesterday urged the Election Commissioner to take steps for issuance of a Police report and a Grama Seva Niladari's certificate for contestants at the local government election before they take oaths provided that they win the election.
Stating that 251 contestants of all parties in the Colombo District only have alleged involvements with crimes, the Lanka Federation of Self National Employees Chairman Sunil Jayawardena made the request by way of a complaint made at the Election Secretariat yesterday morning.
In his complaint, he stated that approximately 20 percent of the contestants islandwide were such persons who have involvement with crimes.
He added that some contestants have charges of heroin trafficking, illegal liquor trading, and some are prostitutes.
He added that if these persons were elected members, the Police would not be able to execute their duties and the activities of such persons would worsen.
He also said that some have connections even with Islamic extremist organizations locally and overseas.
He added that their association was ready to share their facts with the authorities.

Fight against substance abuse
Substance abuse and addiction is the greatest threat against youth in Sri Lanka, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said yesterday.
Hence, action will be taken to knock down the substance circulation system from grassroot level upwards, he further said.
PM Wickremesinghe made these observations at a discussion with the participation of the members of the Youth Parliament. The meeting was held at Temple Trees yesterday evening. Law and Order Minister Sagala Ratnayaka also participated.
Prime Minister Wickremesinghe invited the Youth Parliament members to actively participate in and contribute their recommendations to governments policy making process on education, skills development, youth and female empowerment among many other areas. Premier Wickremesinghe observed that Youth Parliament members are a part of the solution for all these issues in the country and observed that a new programme which will give more responsibilities to these Youth Parliament members.
Speaking further, PM Wickremesinghe said it is unfortunate that the substance circulation has reached even the most rural areas in the country while targeting school students as well. Thus, PM Wickremesinghe requested the Youth Parliament members to organise a national movement against substance abuse in support of the governments fight against drug abuse. PM Wickremesinghe also observed that such a youth campaign against substance abuse will receive the necessary assistance from the Finance Ministry and the Education Ministry as well.
Minister Sagala Ratnayaka speaking on the same issue said new laws will soon be introduced against pharmaceutical drugs. The Health Ministry, Justice Ministry and the Law and Order Ministry are working together on these laws at present, Minister Ratnayaka said.
Three discussion rounds have been held on this matter. We believe that in the next discussion session we will be able to draft an amended bill on these laws. We have also established the Organized Crime Prevention Division and the Anti Narcotics Division. These two divisions address the web of underworld gangs and drugs. Minister Ratnayaka pointed out.
He also said that certain aspects of the rehabilitation system should also change. Minister Ratnayaka also pointed out the importance of youth participation in the process against substance abuse.
The Youth Parliament members had a lengthy discussion with the PM Wickremesinghe on areas including, 25% female representation at the Local Government election, skills development, educational reforms, new constitution, youth empowerment, foreign employees right for vote, brain drain, sports, new electoral system, National Youth Policy, laws on Social Media and higher education.
Speaking on the new constitution, PM Wickremesinghe said a new round of discussion on the proposed new constitution will begin after the Local Government election. He observed that the government will not be able to continue with the new proposed constitution lest the general public have a different opinion on it. Premier Wickremesinghe also pointed out that the Youth Parliament should also contribute their proposals for a new constitution at these fresh discussions.
In a lighter tone, the Youth Parliament members expressed their enthusiasm in a video footage of some dance moves made by PM Wickremesinghe at a private function which went viral on social media. In response, PM Wickremesinghe in a lighter vein said that a dancing competition be organized among the participants and the best dancer at the competition to receive a prize, for much amusement of those who were gathered at the event.

For film buffs only
Title: On films seenAuthor: K S SivakumaranPublisher: S GodagePrice: Rs 650 USD 10
Understanding the film medium has become an essential prerequisite. Usually most of us see a film purely for entertainment. The entertainment value in all arts is always there, but its emphasis vary in terms of its purpose. The purpose again is manifold. If we take the film medium as an art form, we find that there are basically three kinds of films: The entertainers termed commercial films, the arty films which are creative and personal statements of filmmakers and the middle cinema which is neither too arty nor too crude as a banal commercial film. Therefore viewing a film can be in many ways. But the real enjoyment of seeing a film can be derived only if we understand the medium thoroughly. Cinema too is a functional art meaning that every component in the film has a definite purpose.
Such is how K S Sivakumaran sees cinema. Reading Sivakumaran is significant as he takes us a few decades back.
For many writers, the dream of a regular newspaper column is as heady as the scent of fresh newsprint. The bad news is that shrinking circulation and bottom-line management are making it tougher for would-be columnists to land coveted spots at large metropolitan dailies.
Its probably fair to say that the golden age of the columnist is past, notes Sam G. Riley, author of The American Newspaper Columnist (Praeger) and a professor at Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University. And yet, Riley suggests, if todays newspapers lack pluck and personality, then talented columnists are the best antidote.
The editors of smaller local papers agreeand might be willing to give your column a chance.
Seasoned columnist K S Sivakumaran is a rare media personality whose contribution has reached almost every newspaper of this country in both English and Tamil. On Films Seen is a collection of the newspaper columns that Sivakumaran has seen outside Lanka. About 58 films have been reviewed and commented. Some comments on a few Sinhala films appear in his facebook timeline as well as elsewhere.
The purpose of this book  as Sivakumaran aptly mentions  is to enable film buffs who could not have had an opportunity to see some of the films to gather information.
Movie reviews are of paramount importance, content-wise, for a movie buff. Movie reviews should be their content foundation upon which all other content is built upon and around. If there is one thing that you should do consistently, it is reviewing in-theater movies. Movie reviews should be your Number One Priority. Everything else is secondary to that.
David Bordwell suggests in his book Making Meaning, that there are four key components present in film reviews. These components consist of a condensed plot synopsis, background information, a set of abbreviated arguments about the film, and an evaluation.
Generally speaking, when a reviewer is evaluating a film he/she tends to be assessing some, or all, of the following: the motivation for what happens in the film, the film's entertainment value, the film's social relevance and social value, and the film's aesthetic value. If it were easy everyone would be a film critic. It is a great job, most of the time. Unless of course, you are watching a genuinely bad film, the sort that once caused a notable film critic to comment, "That is 90 minutes of my life I can never get back."
Film critics frequently find fault with the film's motivation. That is not to say that they did not like the film's central theme but rather to say that they are looking for the relevance of a particular narrative event, or a justification for a specific action or section of dialogue. Bordwell classifies motivation into four categories: compositional, realistic, intertextual, and artistic. Compositional motivation probes the film's cause-effect logic - that is, does the movie flow logically from one scene to the next. Realistic motivation examines whether the actions that occur within the film are plausible or believable within the realms of the film's fiction. Intertextual motivation examines the relationship between the film and its genre and source material (a novel, a play, etc.) - for example, what would make sense in a musical would not make sense in a western and vice versa. Artistic motivation examines the way a film is made, its use of mise-en-shot and mise-en-scene to achieve a particular artistic look and feel. It is important to note that what is artistically motivated to one reviewer may be distracting to another.
Once again, it all comes down to individual taste. But that individual taste matters when a seasoned columnist like K S Sivakumaran is at it. Which is exactly why, his latest book is worth reading.

First consignment of Sri Lankan Tea sent to Russia after temporary ban
The first tea exports to Russia, since the lifting of the temporary ban imposed by the latter country on Sri Lankas agricultural produce had been sent, said Tea Board Commissioner, Jayantha Edirisinghe.
He explained that they had handed over 62,131kg of tea which met Russian standards and approved by the Tea Board to Sri Lanka Customs on January 2. Tea growers could now engage in tea production without any fear, said the Commissioner, as he believed that in future they would receive an even better price for Sri Lankan tea in Russia.
Edirisinghe further noted that given the swift action taken by the President, Prime Minister and Minister of Plantation Industries Naveen Dissanayake at a diplomatic level, they were able to lift the ban which had been imposed for six months, within two weeks.
Sri Lanka exports 11 percent of its tea to Russia. In December last year, Russia imposed a ban on its tea on the premise that there was a larvae of the khapra beetle in one of its packages.

Follow the Negombo example
The photo caption appearing in a vernacular newspaper showing candidates representing all major political parties at the upcoming Local Government Elections taking a pledge at a church service in Negombo to refrain from violence during the election campaign, no doubt, would have warmed the cockles of all those who saw it who desire a change in the violent political culture in this country.
In a welcome development and rare moment of camaraderie between fierce political opponents, all candidates from the UNP, SLFP and SLPP, together with their area leaders, gave an undertaking to conduct their respective election campaigns in a violence free atmosphere, at the Service, at St.Mary's Church, in Negombo.
Delivering a homily to the candidates and their supporters Rev. Fr. Siswan de Croos, Head of the Cardinal Cooray Spiritual Counselling Centre in Tammita, Negombo requested them all to dedicate themselves to conduct their respective election campaigns free of threats, intimidation and other forms of violent activity. They should also conduct themselves in exemplary fashion during the election period, on the election day, and, also, the post election phase. He went on to state that those who win should welcome the defeated in a friendly manner and neither the victorious nor the defeated should act in a manner that will cause pain of mind to each other. You all should pledge at this moment to carryout your task of faithfully serving the people.
Among those present at the service were former deputy ministers Sarath Kumara Gunaratne, Nimal Lanza, UNP Provincial Councillor Royce Fernando and former Negombo Mayor Dayan Lanza. It is reported that they all mingled together in a cordial and convivial atmosphere after the church service.
This development will be doubly welcomed by the residents of Negombo since the area at one time was a hotbed of political violence. That the candidates have taken the unusual step of convening a church service to make a collective pledge to conduct a violence free election campaign is indicative of a genuine commitment towards this end. It will also help a great deal in maintaining the peace down the ranks, at grassroots level. This is because today whole villages are divided on political lines and the antagonism has even spread to their daily lives and activities.
Hopefully, elsewhere too candidates in the fray would take similar pledges in the temples, mosques and kovils pledging their commitment to conduct their election campaigns free of violence and thuggery. The outcome is bound to create a congenial atmosphere during the campaign, with candidates also being more moderate in attacking their rivals in the fray. Ideally, the precedent by political party candidates at the mini poll in Negombo should be followed by those at the top echelons, at all major elections in the future. The lead in this respect could be provided by Tourism Development Minister John Amaratunga who is also Minister of Christian Affairs. It would go a long way in bringing together all the warring factions in his Wattala electorate. This also could see the departure of the type of intemperate language being used to target opponents, mostly by the top leaders of political parties. Also, ideally, such pledges of the type witnessed in Negombo should include a commitment to strictly adhere to election laws.
This, while making the Election Commission's job that much easier would also ease the pressure on the law enforcement. Already the number of election related incidents are on the rise and the situation could worsen as D day draws near. Since the poll is being conducted on the old ward system, the incidents, hopefully, would be much less this time around than before. But at least Negombo will come unscathed in this respect, since vows made in church are not known to be made lightly by the Catholic community.
Ideally such pledges for a violent free poll should be taken by the main leaders of political parties in unison. This, while sending a clear message to the rank and file would also help change the contentious, confrontational political culture in this country. With the PR system now out of the way this violent political culture, hopefully, will be a thing of the past.
The quality of the candidates too is a factor that will determine the turn an election campaign could take. If bad eggs are nominated by party leaders, then the campaign is bound to turn violent, notwithstanding pledges made before the altar. Regrettably, there are allegations from the Election Monitors that underworld figures have been nominated by all major political parties at this election, as well. One would have thought that with the return to the old electoral system the need for nominating thugs, drug dealers, bootleggers, cattle rustlers and other undesirables would have come to an end. The public would also have hoped for the return of educated cultured and genuine servants of the people to whom politics was not a means to enrich themselves. But it appears that the violent political culture has got so deeply entrenched in the system it would take a long time to break with the trend.

FR petition on Ambagamuwa PS re-fixed for support
A Fundamental Rights (FR) petition which sought an Interim Order restraining the Elections Commission from taking steps to hold elections for the election of members to three Pradeshiya Sabhas, including the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, was yesterday re-fixed for support by the Supreme Court.
The Supreme Courts three-Judge-Bench comprising Justice Buwaneka Aluvihare, Justice K.T. Chitrasiri and Justice Nalin Perera, fixed the petition for support on January 29, since the Attorney General sought further time to get instructions from the Minister in charge of Local Government.
The petitioner, H.D.D. Nandaraja, a former member of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, also seeking an Interim Order suspending the operation of the Gazette Notification issued by the Minister of Provincial Councils and Local Governments, dated 2.11.2017 in respect of these Pradeshiya Sabhas until the final determination of this application.
The Petitioner stated that the Local Government Minister in declaring the dissolution of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba and constituting the aforesaid three Pradeshiya Sabhas has inter alia:
(1) Effected the sub-division of Local Government areas of the former Ambagaumwa Pradeshiya Sabha solely on an ethnic basis;
(2) Failed to consider the historical importance, significance and sacred value of the Sri Pada for the Buddhists, which was located within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(3) Failed to consider the identity and the rights of the historical inhabitants residing within the local limits of the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha;
(4) Failed to assure due protection and fostering of Buddha Sasana (guaranteed by Article 9 of the Constitution), by placing Sri Pada, the most Sacred Place of worship of Buddhists and the sanctuary forming part and parcel thereof in immense danger of mismanagement and ill-treatment by non-Buddhists;
(5) Failed to consider the historical and social reasons and requirements for the demarcation of the existing boundaries of the Ambagauwa Pradeshiya Saba and the need to correspond to the limits of the Assistant Government Agents Division (Divisional Secretary);
(6) Failed to consider the equal rights for effective participation of the people in local government and development of the people living in the existing Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Saba limits and the right for equal distribution of the revenue, wealth and natural resources therein;
(7) Acted ultra-vires, arbitrary, capricious and violate the principle of Natural Justice and Rule of Law.
The petitioner said though there had been no date fixed by the Election Commission to call for nominations with regard to the elections of the Ambagamuwa Pradeshiya Sabha, he had made public announcements that such nominations would be called for Local Government bodies of the entire country together.
Senior Counsel Kanishka Vitharana with Counsel H.M. Thilakaratne, under the instructions of Nuwan Bellanthudawa, appeared for the petitioner.
Senior Deputy Solicitor General Viraj Dayaratne appeared for the Election Commission and Minister of Local Government.

Government to reduce debt to GDP ratio by 70 percent by 2020

The government looking to reduce its debt to GDP ratio to 70 percent by 2020, had cabinet approve this week proposals put forward by the Central Bank to achieve this target.
The Central Bank made a presentation to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Management (CCEM) on November 1, 2017 on the options available to bring down debt to GDP ratio and offers from Investment Houses to facilitate with Liability Management. 
The debt to GDP ratio can mainly be brought down by decelerating debt accumulation and the key for this is to reduce the government budget deficit, informed the Central Bank.
The cabinet paper on the Central Bank was submitted to Cabinet by Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe. 
The following options according to the cabinet paper have been recommended;
Achieve the revenue targets set out in the medium-term fiscal projections (15% of GDP in 2017; 15.5% in 2018, 16% in 2019 and 16.5% in 2020)
Rationalize capital expenditure to be included in the government budget- institutionalize a process for assessing costs and benefits associated with proposed capital expenditure projects
Encourage non-debt creating domestic and/or foreign currency inflows to the government
Strengthen the financial position and operations of major state-owned business enterprises
Careful articulation of domestic debt issuances; Effective debt liability management
Facilitate international financial institutions, such as International Finance Corporation (IFC) to issue rupee debt in the international market to finance various projects in the government budget
Issue local loans prudently and when loans can be obtained with a low interest and pay loans obtained at a high interest using such low interest loans.

Govt paving way for foreign interferences - Eliya Convener
Eliya Organisation Convener Ven. Prof. Medagoda Abhayatissa Thera said the government is now paving the way for foreign interferences into the country's domestic affairs.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday,Ven. Abhayatissa Thera said the loss from the bond issue which amounts to around Rs 11,145 million will affect the countrys economy negatively.
"The problem wont be solved by naming Arjun Mahendran or Ravi Karunanayake in the Bond Commission report. Whenever the economy is destroyed, we will have to beg from the other countries,"the thera said.
The imperialists want to protect Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to achieve their interests. Their aim was not to ensure prosperity for Sri Lankan people through the so called January 8, 2015 revolution,but to allow Diaspora groups to carve out the separate state.
"They want the Prime Minister to implement the Federal Constitution. That is why many western countries directly contributed for the regime change on January 8, 2015 and We can already see the results as the Hambantota Magampura port now has a Chinese flag in the main position," he said.
The country will be trapped-in-debt- when the economy is destabilised after selling our resources. Both UNP and the SLFP must held responsible for hunting war heros, selling national assets and an attempt for creating separate state through the new Constitution.
He further said that JVP always sabotages any attempt to rebuild the country by misleading the people. Although, that JVP promised to 'regulate' the Yahapalana government if it goes on the wrong path,it has not happened yet even after the lapse of three years.Now people have to decide on February 10, whether they will further support to destroy the country or rebuild the country. Veteran artiste Shriyantha Mendis said that imperialists who destroyed Sri Lanka in the past are repeating it in a different ways today. Both rulers are indeed moving the country backward today.Therefore, We urge the public to take a correct decision at this election for the sovereignty of the country, he added.

The Gratiaen Prize Silver Jubilee: Gracious words
A creative writer has a greater power to transform the people and the society at large. In vice versa winning a literary award makes a constructive influence on the literary life of a creative writer. Miraculously the Gratiaen Trust from the inception to this date has successfully proved that it has the ability to do both simultaneously.
So the Trust has been doing it during last two and a half decade and celebrates its Silver Jubilee in 2018.
Forceful effect
Enthusiastic budding English writers all around the country could present their creative works now to this competition. Being a finalist or a winner, a writer would definitely get more opportunities to rate his or her respective work on a higher platform in compared to the works of the other writers. Winning a literary prize at most times generates a very forceful effect especially on the enhancement of the author's profile as well as their works. Literary awards open many avenues to budding writers to realize their dreams to rise up to the higher echelons of their literary life.
Not only literary awards serve as an index for identifying quality literature, on the other hand, they enhance and establish reputations of writers and publishing companies. We have heard of many international literary awards. However, the Gratiaen Prize is the only literary award exclusively confined to English writers of Sri Lanka - which was instituted by very famous author Michael Ondaatje in 1992 with the money he received from his Man Booker Prize winning novel The English Patient. In Ondaatjes own words  this Gratiaen prize is an attempt on one level to share the wealth, to celebrate and test and trust ourselves, to select and argue about the literature around us. This is something to take seriously, not just to see it as a jewel or decoration 
Every year Rs 200,000 is awarded in appreciation of the best work of creative English writing at the Gratiaen award. Entries eligible for the prize includes novels, a collection of short stories, poetry, drama, biography as well as other creative types of writings such as memoirs. Both published work, as well as unpublished works in the form of manuscripts, could be presented for this competition. All submitted works are evaluated by competent three judges and finally, the Gratiaen Trust announces the winner from five shortlisted works, at the main Gratiaen prize award ceremony. The prize which has a greater effect to transform the winners literary life is sponsored by Sarasavi Bookshop Pvt Ltd  a leader in bookselling, importing and publishing in Sri Lankan book trade.
Wide recognition
Any creative Sri Lankan English writer dreaming to publish his best work with a major publisher could not find a better opportunity other than the Gratiaen prize. For all the times this will be the highest literary award for creative English writing in Sri Lanka. Other than the wide recognition that the author gets, this award serves as a catalyst to motivate individual writers to put forth their very best. Apart from that for any prospective writers this would be the main gateway to the international arena of literature. In order to achieve this a lot of hard work and committeemen are essential on the part of the authors.
Also, this is a greater opportunity for the upcoming new generation of Sri Lankan English writers as The Sarasavi Publishers undertake to publish their unpublished winning works under the reputed Sarasavi imprint.
In order to promote more popular Sri Lanka English literature, the silver jubilee of the Gratiaen award will really be a landmark to encourage budding writers to bring out more refined creative works representing our identities while keeping an international flavour.

The wildlife officials at Hambantota said that only hardcore elephants that possess strong genes are sent to the Horowpathana elephant protection center. These elephants are those who

Influx of  luxury cars at low duty to deny state billions
The governments Budget 2018 which removed the ad-volerum calculation method of duty on vehicles and brought about a scenario of subsidising the duty on super luxury cars has resulted in the coffers losing around Rs 25-40 million from each of these vehicles, alleged a top official of a leading automobile import company based in Colombo.
As a result of this there has been an influx of luxury cars into the country recently of the brands such as Ferrari, Lamborghini, Porsche, Bentley, Range Rover, Mercedes, BMW and Audi etc , he said.
Confining the duty calculation on vehicles engine capacity and removing the ad-volerum calculation of duty introduced by the budget is seen as a move adopted to discourage the average citizens the chance of purchasing a car by making them expensive. However this resulted in making the super luxury category cheaper.
It is reported that many of these super luxury vehicles imported hurriedly after the relaxation of tax on them have already been cleared from the port and there are many more on the way, some by air.
The loss projected for the next 12 months based on 5,000 vehicles at an average of Rs 20 million per vehicle would be in excess of Rs100 billion. It is also the view of many in the automobile industry that it is time that this oversight is corrected without being shy about it as some of the senior policy makers also have shown their surprise over this serious issue and some say that this can even exceed the alleged loss reported in the infamous bond scandal.
A senior industry source on condition of anonymity said that apparently already over 100 super luxury cars had been cleared from the port causing losses of billions of rupees to the government and over 400 units are in shipments that will arrive in the country in the next few weeks. He also said that another alarming point is that the new system creates opportunities for siphoning out money from the country as the CIF value is now not considered for duty calculations, thus aiding money launderers and anyone who wish to send money out of the country to do so by hooking up an invoice and siphoning out money, putting pressure on the already stressed foreign reserves.

Japan - sri Lanka cultural  ties reach  new heights: PM
Sri Lankas long standing cultural, political and economic relations with Japan have geared up to a new level, focusing on the field of science and technology, said Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
He said so, was attending a ceremony at the Parliamentary Complex yesterday, organized by the Honganji Foundation to commemorate the 70th Anniversary of Sri Lankas Independence and to reaffirm Japan - Sri Lanka bonds.
Consequent to Japanese Foreign Affairs Minister Taro Konos visit to Sri Lanka last week, the Premier said that President Maithripala Sirisena would make a visit to Japan in March, enhancing the political ties between the two countries. A Parliamentary delegation headed by Speaker Karu Jayasuriya would also visit Japan by the end of February.
Japan recognizes Sri Lanka as one of the hubs in the Indian Ocean. We have to take the advantage of our countrys strategic location, he said, while appreciating the Japanese Governments assistance in the fields of economic development, energy, Port development and planning of Kandy city development.
The Premier observing that the ties between Japan and Sri Lanka are based primarily on culture, said the common heritage of Buddhism led to frequent cultural exchanges between the two countries.
The PM pleasantly recalled that visiting the city of Nara, the first Buddhist kingdom, was a worthwhile exercise, which unfortunately many people in Sri Lanka had not realized.
Wickremesinghe, recalling the contributions of former President J. R. Jayewardene, Sir John Kotalawala, former Japanese PM Shigeru Yoshida and current Japanese PM ShinzoAbes father Shintaro Abe on strengthening political ties between the two countries, said strong political ties led to strong economic ties.

Not forgetting the past is a rare and noble human virtue. the Japanese have this quality in abundance.

Koreas start first official talks in two years
SOUTH KOREA: North and South Korea began their first official talks in more than two years on Tuesday, focussing on the forthcoming Winter Olympics after months of tensions over Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme.
The talks in Panmunjom, the truce village in the Demilitarized Zone that divides the peninsula, came after the North's leader Kim Jong-Un indicated in his New Year's speech that he could send a delegation to next month's Games in Pyeongchang in the South.
Seoul responded with an offer of a high-level dialogue, and last week the hotline between the neighbours was restored after being suspended for almost two years.
Seoul's five-member delegation, led by unification minister Cho Myoung-Gyon, travelled to Panmunjom in a convoy of vehicles, passing a group of well-wishers holding a banner at a checkpoint leading towards the DMZ.
The North's group, of similar size and led by senior official Ri Son-Gwon, walked over the Military Demarcation Line at Panmunjom for the talks, pictures showed -- just yards from where a defector ran across in a hail of bullets two months ago.
Looking businesslike, Cho and Ri shook hands at the entrance to the Peace House, the building on the southern side where the discussions were being held, and again across the table.
In accordance with standard practice in the North, Ri wore a badge on his left lapel bearing an image of the country's founding father Kim Il-Sung and his son and successor Kim Jong-Il. Cho also wore a lapel badge, depicting the South Korean flag.
Let's present the people with a precious new year's gift, said the North's Ri. There is a saying that a journey taken by two lasts longer than the one travelled alone. Cho told him that Seoul believed the Pyeongchang Games will become a peace Olympics as most valuable guests from the North are going to join many others from all around the world.
The people have a strong desire to see the North and South move toward peace and reconciliation, he added.
It was a radically different tone from the rhetoric of recent months, which have seen Kim and US President Donald Trump trade personal insults and bellicose threats of war, while Pyongyang has launched missiles capable of reaching the US mainland and carried out its sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date.
Seoul has been keen to proclaim the Games in Pyeongchang, just 80 kilometres (50 miles) south of the DMZ, as a peace Olympics in the wake of missile and nuclear tests by the North -- but it needs Pyongyang to attend to make the description meaningful.
If the North agrees, one of the top agenda items will be whether the two Koreas' sportspeople make joint entrances to the opening and closing ceremonies, as they did for Sydney 2000, Athens 2004 and the 2006 Winter Games in Turin.
The size and membership of the North Korean delegation and their accommodation -- widely expected to be paid for by Seoul -- will also be discussed.
The group may stay on a cruise ship in Sokcho, about an hour's drive from the Olympic venue, which would enable their movements to be closely monitored and controlled.
With only two winter sports athletes qualified, North Korea is likely to bolster its presence by sending significant numbers of cheerleaders to the Pyeongchang Games, which run from February 9 to 25, analysts say. -AFP

The Man Booker Prize Golden Jubilee:Booked years
And so starts a new year and a big one for the Man Booker Prize which turns 50 in 2018. Mohsin Hamid will be happy if it kicks off as well as 2017 ended. His Man Booker Prize shortlisted Exit West was named by Barack Obama as one of his cultural highlights of the past year.
The former president, still America's most popular man, makes a tradition of picking his favourite reading and listening and at the end of a year he must have found particularly difficult Hamid's novel took its place alongside books by others such as Naomi Alderman (The Power) and Ron Chernow (Grant). Hamid's musical tastes are unknown but, for the record, Obama picked Jay Z, Harry Styles and Rihanna among his faves. Mo, Jay Z, RiRi and Harry  sounds like a supergroup.
Ground running
One of this year's Man Booker Prize judges, Val McDermid, has hit the ground running. Although the first submissions will already be piling up around her, she is heading a project to resurrect a forgotten Scottish writer, the 19th-century novelist Susan Edmonstone Ferrier. Her writing stands up very well in comparison with the big-name Scottish writers of her day, like Sir Walter Scott, said McDermid.
But the most remarkable thing about Ferrier is that memory of her has all but disappeared. McDermid has written a new story about Ferrier, New Year's Resurrection, which is being projected on to the sides of various buildings throughout Edinburgh. You can download the associated app and follow the story from beginning to end around 12 sites in the city where Ferrier lived, worked and walked. The story/walking tour/theatrical experience runs until 25th January.
Ferrier, says McDermid, earned significantly more substantial publisher advances than Jane Austen. And now almost nobody knows her name.
In a recent piece discussing writers' tips from the likes of Dickens, Tolstoy and Hemingway several Man Booker alumni were included for their wisdom. Hilary Mantel, for example, counselled cultivating self-confidence  arrogance, if you can manage it. You write to impose yourself on the world, and you have to believe in your own ability when the world shows no sign of agreeing with you. Zadie Smith was blunt: Work on a computer that is disconnected from the internet.
Muriel Spark meanwhile was more comforting  get a cat: The cat will settle down and be serene, with a serenity that passes all understanding. And the tranquillity of the cat will gradually come to affect you, sitting there at your desk, so that all the excitable qualities that impeded your concentration compose themselves and give your mind back the self-command it has lost. All very useful no doubt but no magic key.
Raised aloft
The prize calendar never sleeps and the first winners of 2018 are already in. So congratulations to Jon McGregor whose Man Booker Prize longlisted Reservoir 13 has just won the Costa Novel Award. His books now enters a death-match with the other category winners (poetry, children's book, first novel, biography) and the last one standing, the book of the year, will have its arm raised aloft on January 30.
Jessica Cohen, meanwhile, the translator of last year's Man Booker International Prize winner, David Grossman's A Horse Walks into a Bar, has just been nominated for the translation prize in the 2018 PEN America Literary Awards. Cohen donated her Man Booker International prize money to an Israeli human rights group so, should she win, it will be interesting to see what she does with her share of PEN's $315,000 prize pot  no one would blame her if she treated herself to some quite unnecessary luxury gewgaw.

But the melody lingers on
Villu Paatu is one of the traditional Tamil entertainment art. Generally high pitch Tamil folk music is adopted for this art form. This Villu Paatu tradition is still considered as a part of Tamil culture. It is widely practised among the Tamil community all over the world and by the South Indian community. Even today despite numerous modern well developed the electronic system in the mass media, the metropolitan and village level average Tamil masses are still very much anxious to see this ancient traditional entertainment art form.
Yet, today seeing live Villu Paatu programmes are quite rare. But a few years back some non-commercialized state-owned television channels telecasted this traditional art form through their channels, with the intention of preserving the traditional cultural heritage of the Tamil society. Such opportunity provided a good opportunity for the general viewers as well as for the younger generation to have a glimpse to know about their ancient traditional art form.
Without the arrow
Literally, Villu Paatu means bow song. In Tamil Villu means bow. Paatu in the Tamil language means song. Because of this, this instrument got the name Villu Paatu. For Villu Paatu large bow nearly about four to five feet length bow is used without the arrow.
The long and abnormal bow is rationally used as this musical instrument. Very simple language based music is adopted for this art. And a mixed variety of tempo-thrilling music is chosen for this traditional art form. Generally, this art form is very popular among the average middle-class population.
The main storyteller who illustrates the story in a heart-catching manner, a few especially seven to eight supportive members also participate in this troupe, to bring out the theme of the story effectively with musical support. In between, they engage in exchanging dialogue between themselves to bring out the theme to reach the audience.
Normally with this, folk music is also accompanied by some classical instrumental music such as Miruthangam, Dholak, Khole, and Kanchira. Besides these classical musical instruments, a few variations of folk musical instruments are also adopted. For instance Udduku a handy folk drum is also often used in Villu Paatu.
The player keeps the drum in a horizontal position when he plays the drum. The second member plays the wooden block thala (cymbal) which is often referred to as Kashtal. The third person of the troupe plays the metallic (cymbal) thala.
It is generally said that this art form was originated in the 15th century. It is said that originally this was introduced by a person named Arasa Pullavar. This simple homemade and handmade instrument is quite popular all over the world especially among the worldwide Tamil population and South Indian population. Chances for viewing live Villu Paatu practices are considered very rare in this present era.
Temple authorities
Earlier in the temple festivals to impart certain values or religious doctrine to the devotees, after the daily annual festival, the temple authorities organized this Villu Paatu shows. Some professional troupes were permanently engaged by the temple authorities.
Initially, this bow was made out of Palmyra wood and but presently it is made of metal. Because metal made bow is easy to carry. Sometimes the bow rests on a mud pot. The two edges of the bow are connected with high tension string. In between small cymbals and sometimes small bells are tied to the main high tension string. Even sometimes small bells are also securely tied to the bow base.
The main person sits in the middle, in front of the bow and he narrates the selective theme of the story. While narrating and singing, he now and then strikes the main string of the bow to give effect to the performance. ses two sticks. The two sticks are called veesukols. During the performance, the troupe members exchange arguments or discussion among themselves.
Sometimes the troupe or team is divided into two. Even sometimes the discussions are taken in an amusement manner in-between the team members of the same troupe. Earlier the Villu Paatu selected the only religious-based epics for its theme, but now- a- days sometimes Villu Paatu teams adopt social themes for their programmes to bring out social vigilance among the masses. Within the one and the same team, one section opposes the views of the other section.
Attractive folklore
The opposing team is called Lavani Paatu. Yet both sections of the team are considered as one team. Villu Paatu is regarded as one of the most attracting folklore of Tamil culture.

A mission unswayed through four decades-Part 3
We conclude our series on the Mahaweli Development Project with an interview with Nanda Abeywickrama, who functioned as Secretary, Ministry of Lands and Lands Development, from 1978-88 and was closely associated with the original Mahaweli plan from his days in the Agriculture Ministry in the 1970s.
Abeywickramas direct involvement with the Accelerated Mahaweli Programme (AMP) started with his appointment to the Mahaweli Task Force soon after his return from post graduate studies in Land Policy at the University of Cambridge, UK, in September 1977. The Task Force developed the initial strategy for the AMP and was regularly reviewed by President J.R. Jayewardene.
The twin Ministries of Lands and Land Development (MLLD) which would oversee overall policy of Mahaweli Development (MD) which in turn would oversee AMP operations under one Minister, the late Gamini Dissanayake, were created in September 1978, followed by the Mahaweli Authority of Sri Lanka (MASL) in 1979.
The following are excerpts of an interview conducted with Abeywickrama via email:
Q. How did you balance the environmental and developmental needs of the Project
This is a very interesting question. When the government that came to power in 1977 focused on the Mahaweli as a Lead Project and conceptualized the AMP, environmental concerns were not uppermost in the minds of development planners in Sri Lanka, the priority being infrastructure development which was the urgency of the hour.
The Mahaweli Master Plan developed by UN FAO in the 1960s envisaged a step-wise implementation over a 30-year time frame for the provision of irrigation facilities for 362,000Ha and settlement of an equal number of peasant families in addition to generating 560MW of power.
The 1977 government made a bold political decision to accelerate the project to complete four major power/irrigation dams (Kotmale, Victoria, Randenigala and Maduru Oya) and several other reservoirs, to irrigate 158.800Ha in systems A, B, C, D and G and another 23,600Ha in System H, making a total of 182,400Ha in six years.
There were many challenges as well as imponderables in the fields of engineering and power generation and in human settlement since there were many options to be considered and choices to be made.
The main reason that prompted the President to appoint me as Secretary, MLLD, apart from my knowledge and experience in Land Policy and Settlement and my seniority in the SLAS, I believe, was my post-graduate training in Agricultural Planning at FAO in Rome and in Land Policy and Economy at the University of Cambridge, UK, where I got a good grounding in environmental issues confronting major development projects as well. Hence AMP was a real-life professional challenge for me - to balance the countrys development and environmental goals.
While the AMP framework was on the drawing boards and initial fieldwork underway, the government, in response to environmental concerns expressed in different quarters, commissioned an Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA) on the AMP, the first such major initiative in Sri Lanka, with assistance from USAID.
The team was made up of Tippets-Abbot-McCarthy-Stratton (TAMS). This team, following an exhaustive survey, submitted a report to government in 1980, now called the TAMS Report, taking the entire Mahaweli basin as a single unit (not by projects).
Project impacts relevant to surrounding areas and to the upstream watershed were also considered. The TAMS Report recommended some far-reaching changes to the components and targets of the AMP already cleared by the government and the Mahaweli Task Force.
Soil conservation and agro-forestry in the upper catchment, protective planting of forests on hill tops and slopes, planting forests for fuel wood and timber, establishing wildlife reserves and natural parks with connecting corridors to retain high quality wild life and maintaining riverine forests on reservations of all waterways were some of the novel features recommended which had escaped the attention of the planners.
It also addressed an important issue: the potential shortage of fuel wood to meet the needs of future settlers, which would become critical after several years.
These recommendations necessitated the re-drawing of the land use plan; consequently the potential irrigable extent and, by extension, the number of settlers had to be revised downwards from an original 182,400 to around 125,000.
Although this was politically less attractive, the government complied with the recommendations in the interests of providing a more sustainable environment for the communities. It was estimated that the forestry programme under AMP had to cater to the needs of 250,000 families (1.5 million people) inclusive of the non-farm families. Over time, it was argued, that increase in off-farm economic activities would offset the reduction in the number of setter families.
The decision to conduct an EIA on the AMP at the very outset proved to be wise and beneficial. In the first place, some of the mistakes made in river basin projects like Gal Oya and Uda Walawe were avoided; secondly, forestry programmes executed in the catchment areas were a direct outcome of the AMP and reduced soil erosion and degradation and siltation of reservoirs.
The AMP, by its very magnitude and speed of execution, generated awareness and consciousness in taking the long-term effects of river basin development projects. The concern of both national and international groups was sharpened by these factors themselves. Hence it developed a self-propelling concern for adopting sound environmental practices.
The recommendations of the TAMS Report and its adoption came at a critical moment which enabled government and donor interest to be heightened to mobilize resources for development with conservation.
In discussing the potential conflict between development and environment, the late Minister Gamini Dissanayake, in his address at the Annual Sessions of the Institute of Architects in 1984 said, We have seen this conflict surfacing at all levels and we have made a conscious effort to see that if one were to enter the Ring, as it were, in the perpetual conflict between exploitation and conservation, the government is not merely going to be an Umpire. The government is going to intervene on the side of conservation and preservation. That has been this Governments commitment from 1977 up to now.
There were other environment-related measures taken in the location and design of townships (off the high roads), allocation of premises for utilities and architecture of houses and shops, all of which were novel and forward looking.
The ultimate purpose and effort of the enormous amount of capital invested in the Mahaweli Project is to provide a better life for over one million people, principally through agriculture. The dams and the tanks and the canals are the means to this end. The people who settle in these areas should not only earn more money, they should live in better houses, they should have better villages and better towns than where they came from. Finance, transport, marketing and many other considerations come together to create a better quality of life. And we want to give them enough space so that with the accumulation of capital and the development of a society on its own terms and according to its own rhythm, it will develop perhaps after another century and beyond. This process must necessarily take a long time, said Minister Dissanayake.
Q . How well was the land policy designed by you implemented on the ground
Although the AMP was implemented by MASL under the provisions of the MASL Act which enjoyed wide powers, precautions were taken to ensure that the land settlement policy was consistent with that prevailing at the national level and the regulations and guidelines of the Land Commissioner (LC) who is the national-level authority for the implementation of the Land Development Ordinance (LDO), which is the operative law for allocation of state land to settlers.
In the first place, the design of the settlements for irrigated land and the homesteads was based on field research conducted in Mahaweli System H during the 1970s with support from Sogreah, a French consulting firm. The new design was a cluster and turn out model, a departure from the previous ribbon type settlement along field canals which had proved to be less productive. This was consistently adopted in AMP. The accepted rules for maintaining road and canal reservations, community and commercial needs and village woodlots were religiously adhered to.
In the selection of settlers, AMP operated through the Land Commissioners Department and the government agents who adopted government-approved criteria for screening applicants for land on their potential ability to be good farmers. Since the applicants are selected at open public land kachcheries in their own localities, there is little room for deviation from the approved criteria for there would be objections from competitors. The system though not foolproof, I would say, was sound and fair.
One deficiency I had observed in the selection process was that one could end up with a set of selectees who would not eventually make a cohesive community in the new environment. Although we had proposals for remedying these, the competition for land from landless was so intense that fine-tuning these concepts became impractical. As a remedy MASL had a strong team of community development officers to design and implement programmes to promote social cohesion. I would think they have been largely successful, subject of course, to the inherent shortcomings within any social milieu.
AMP, in the selection of settlers, went a step further and selected persons with other skills like masonry, carpentry, sports, etc., as well as entrepreneurs like small businessmen. AMP also catered to bigger investors who would venture into non-traditional farming systems which was the right thing to do.
Q: Looking back, do you believe that the land policies implemented then have been successful
There is no yes or no answer to this question.
I would say that Mahaweli settlers were definitely more fortunate than settlers in other previous settlement schemes or peasants living in their own traditional villages in that immense state resources were invested on infrastructure provision for these people, especially in the initial years.
The magnitude of the project, the continued availability of resources and a heavy management input with some imaginative concepts like animal husbandry programmes, Mahaweli Games, secured competitions and so forth provided a kick start for the settlers. The settlers by and large enjoyed an assured supply of irrigation water for regular cultivation backed by a sophisticated Water Management Secretariat which orchestrated and monitored the bulk water allocation. This was a major asset. Additionally, there was constant attention from the Minister or perhaps even from the Head of State level to solve emerging problems faced by settlers.
About 20 years back, I visited System C with a Japanese research leader. Then we came across a number of enterprising farmers; one who was growing ornamental fish on part of his plot and making good money and another who had a permit to fish in the tank and supplement his family income.
On another visit, I met some women who were operating a very successful micro-credit scheme without retaining cash at home since their capital was always in circulation. In recent years, though we often see media reports about crop damage due to water shortages and flood damage. I am not sure whether they are genuine or distortions.
Q: Could you recall some of the significant moments during your term at the Ministry
Well, in the first place, my entry into the AMP itself and appointment as Secretary, LLD is a significant memory.
Secondly, Minister Gamini Dissanayakes portfolio was very big and the budget very high. In addition, he had other interests - in plantation trade unions, as President of the Cricket Board, Buddhist activities and so on. So, early on he told me that he wants to focus on wider politics and that I should run the Ministry. True to his word, he allowed me to select my professional team and allowed wide discretion providing excellent leadership at critical moments.
Minister Dissanayake always reminded us that his is an outdoor Ministry and that senior staff should spend more time with people in the field. He always encouraged us to use helicopters to travel to far-flung districts since the road network was poor then.
Going back, as a member of the think tank I had a very interesting experience when NGP organised a travelling seminar to brainstorm on the AMP strategy. We were a group of about 10 - NGP Panditharatne, Eng. Douglas Ladduwahetty, Mahi Wickramaratne, Dr Walter Abeygunawardana, Dr Melva Perera, Eng. Kirupa Rajaratnam, Dr Gamini Gunasekara, A D N Fernando, myself and one other, all packed into a Volkswagen micro- bus, started off early morning from Colombo on the AMP route via Kandy.
Before reaching Teldeniya, we witnessed the rock drilling operations for the Dam under way near the Victoria Falls; as we reached the plains we saw that work on Ulhitiya, the first reservoir planned under AMP, had already commenced. The dialogue on how to and when to continued throughout. As we were a multi-disciplinary team, disagreements were many but everybody learnt from each other.
We reached the Eastern Province by sunset and continued discussions over drinks and dinner at the Irrigation Department Circuit bungalow at Vakarai. Over three days, we covered the entire eastern flank of the AMP, including the Maduru Oya dam where they had stumbled on the 1500 year old ancient sluice while setting out the dam axis for the new reservoir.
The travelling seminar was a tremendous success especially in overcoming disciplinary barriers and agency prejudices. We reached consensus on the direction and strategy to be submitted to government.
Q: What are your thoughts on having finally completed the Mahaweli Project
I took early retirement in December 1988 to join the International Irrigation Management Institute (IIMI now IWMI) after 10 consecutive years as Secretary LLD. By that time, all the major dams had been completed and commissioned and settlers had moved into Systems B and C amidst severe constraints caused by JVP and LTTE disruptions; thus the initial phase was successfully completed along with many innovations especially in resettlement activities and community development. Mahaweli had acquired a brand name.
The credit for that should go to Minister Gamini Dissanayake who assembled a very talented multi-disciplinary team drawn from the public and private sectors and motivated them through a very imaginative and sophisticated management system drawn from real-life experiences. Staff morale and commitment was very high because the government responded swiftly whenever obstacles surfaced.
However AMP was not without its detractors. At the very outset, there was criticism that the acceleration was not feasible and that borrowing funds from international agencies was not in the national interest. However, in the event practically all assistance came either in the form of grants or as very concessionary soft loans. The entire AMP was completed within US$ 1 billion and mostly through foreign funding. That achievement would be unthinkable today.
The President and the Minister also dealt with public criticism very swiftly, as for example when LSSP leaders Dr. N.M. Perera and Dr. Colvin R. de Silva expressed some concerns, the President and the Minister took them before the farmers in the field and resolved the issues. Similarly, opposition politicians, media personnel and other interested parties were invited to visit the work sites and shown around the work in progress.
Having said that, in the years that followed, it cannot be said that the same level of imaginative leadership prevailed. To illustrate, on completion of the initial dams and the downstream settlements, there was a need to review the management model.
Logically, there should have been a transition to a river basin organisation model as a regulatory body to plan and allocate the water among competing uses through sophisticated yet consultative mechanisms, while downstream management could have been merged with the adjacent major irrigated settlements by empowering the settlers to manage their affairs.
In this way, MASL costs could be reduced substantially. Furthermore, if an incentives regime for improved water use and agricultural productivity were introduced, there would be greater prosperity and innovation and cost sharing by the farmers.
Dependence of the local community on MASL could be reduced considerably if the land tenure system were liberalised and public-private partnerships were encouraged to optimize the use of the resources already developed. If such radical reforms are not introduced, the standard of living of the settlers will stagnate at a level ordained by the level of resources available from government. Public funds should be allocated for more urgent and productive sectors like technological innovations and R&D. MASL should not become another CGR or CTB.Minister Gamini Dissanayake (standing, extreme right) addressing cabinet to recommend the Accelerated Mahaweli Program in September 1977.

Modern machines to root out invasive aquatic plants
Five aquatic weed harvesters will be imported for the first time to remove invasive aquatic plants in reservoirs, Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development Minister Mahinda Amaraweera said.
The Minister has made the decision considering the extensive damage that invasive aquatic plants cause to the wetland system. Salvinia, Water Lettuce and Water Hyacinth are some of them.
The invasive plants badly affect freshwater fish, and agricultural practices since most of the reservoirs have no capacity to store sufficient water due to invasive plants in them.
Many reservoirs and canals, mainly in the North Central Province, were destroyed with invasive aquatic plants. the Minister said. Water resources that people use for drinking water were also damaged, he said.
Ministry officials were instructed to purchase five aquatic weed harvesters at a cost of Rs. 50 million, the Minister said.

National Financial Inclusion  Strategy to be formulated
IFC, a member of the World Bank Group, is partnering with the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) to develop the countrys first National Financial Inclusion Strategy (NFIS) to promote a more effective and efficient process to improve financial inclusion across Sri Lanka.
IFC, over the course of the project, will provide technical assistance to CBSL to develop the NFIS, via an extensive development process involving consultations with members of the public sector, private sector, civil society organizations, and academia. The process provides an important opportunity to introduce an evidence-based, prioritized, better resourced, and more comprehensive approach to expanding access to financial services.
CBSL has identified the need to develop a strategy for financial inclusion at the national level to achieve sustainable development and create a conducive financial environment to bring under-served segments of society to the formal financial sector, said Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy, Governor, CBSL. It will provide guidance on the directions for the country to achieve an inclusive financial system where people have effective access to a range of affordable financial services.
The development of the strategy will be led by CBSL with the support of the Ministry of National Policies and Economic Affairs, Ministry of Finance & Mass Media, IFC and all financial sector stakeholders.
Financial inclusion is a priority for the World Bank Group for achieving universal financial access by 2020, said Amena Arif, IFC Country Manager for Sri Lanka and Maldives. This National Financial Inclusion Strategy will not only improve access to, and usage of, financial services, but will also contribute to overall inclusive growth in Sri Lanka.
By embarking on the development of this strategy, Sri Lanka is moving towards joining more than 30 countries that have launched similar strategies.
Sri Lanka is a priority country for IFC. IFCs committed portfolio in Sri Lanka covers projects across a range of sectors, including infrastructure, tourism, renewable energy, finance, and healthcare. IFC also provides advisory services to promote sustainable growth among small and medium enterprises by facilitating access to finance and by offering capacity-building and training opportunities.

New insights into cultural studies
Nayars work is categorized into two parts. The first part contains the materials on contexts, theories and methods. The second part takes into consideration the sites of culture which include the aspects of cultures of consumption, cultures of space and cultures of communication. In several ways, the two parts are interlinked. Both parts contain material drawn from the most significant trends in the field of cultural studies which throw penetrative insights into the learner and teacher. One significant segment in the study is the light thrown on the area titled as postcolonialism and
cultural studies by and large an area forgotten by most orientalscholars.
The term Cultural Studies has come to stay as a household word as used in many academic and other allied fields. Over the years, the terms culture, cultural studies, cultural impact, cultural barriers have given various meanings in these fields of studies. But still, there is a stormy tendency on the part of the scholars to go back to the meanings, definitions as well as the concepts of culture as laid down the centuries in both the Oriental and the Occidental contexts.
The attempt on the part of the lecturer Pramod K Nayar in his work An Introduction to Cultural Studies is to throw light to the study of culture, taking into account certain aspects of the study inclusive of the scope, aim, methods, theories as well as the more popular areas as created in the study with the use of technology such as the mobile phone as well as Internet. Thus the advent of the areas in popular culture is taken into consideration.
Simple introduction
Nayar basically attempts to address the teacher as well as the upper grade of the student, perhaps at the university level of learning, on these issues. As such, the work of Nayar is an attempt to give a simple introduction to the various ways of understanding culture. The ways that are now often collectively termed as cultural studies: furthermore the work is an attempt to explore the meanings of everyday processes, places and acts like communication, space and shopping. In this manner, Nayar takes the reader from the more known to the more unknown territories in the field of cultural studies, linked to the lineages as well as the more modernistic uses and abuses, perhaps linked to the advent of technology into the traditional patterns of cultural aspects. Wherever possible, the writer cum teacher of cultural studies is helped by underlining the more emphatic aspects. One such example goes as follows: On the term Popular Culture, the writer underlines:
Popular culture is the set of practices, artefacts and beliefs shared by the masses and is constituted by the everyday life of the masses, the food habits, fashion, forms of transport, the music, the reading habits, the spaces they occupy and traverse.
This paves the way both for the teacher as well as the student to delve more emphatically on the culture concepts as laid down over the years due to the expansion of the accepted forms of learning and teaching. Several perhaps commonplace questions too are raised in the context. At a particular junction, Nayar asks: Why is Agatha Christie not studied in English Departments, when most people read Christie rather than Thomas Hardy
He too goes to the extent of showing how the aspects of culture are linked to the aspects of popular political beliefs and practices.
Various cultures
Nayars work is categorized into two parts. The first part contains the materials on contexts, theories and methods. The second part takes into consideration the sites of culture which include the aspects of cultures of consumption, cultures of space and cultures of communication. In several ways, the two parts are interlinked. Both parts contain material drawn from the most significant trends in the field of cultural studies which throw penetrative insights into the learner and teacher. One significant segment in the study is the light thrown on the area titled as postcolonialism and cultural studies by and large an area forgotten by most oriental scholars.
This also paves the way to trace some of the trends set by the concept called globalization. According to the scholar Nayar, the global trends left behind as a result of postcolonialism, has to be retraced taking into account the concept of globalizing culture which is still in the infant stages of interpretation and analysis. It is believed that global economics and media interactions determine the aspects of cultural trendsetting at the behaviour of the individual in a society. How far this is true in ones own cultural context may be a question raised.
In the Indian context, Nayar gives one example which goes as follows.
In India for instance, in the heavily mediated cultural context, of the present, the elite / wealthy members of society can have access to Yves St Laurent or a Chanel line because these are now available.
Global economy
As such he concludes: Cultures and traditions are therefore modified not with the local culture, in mind, but with global patterns. Their choices are determined by the global economy.
Thus the work of Nayar rests on several layers that enlighten the reader to know much more than one can learn from the study of a single culture. I felt for a moment that this is the type of work that should be made available to the students and teachers of Mass Communication.

Nonagenarian found imprisoned by daughter
The Kandy Women and Children Bureau yesterday found a 96-year-old woman, mother of six, imprisoned in a room without proper food or water in Anthony Watte, Yatiyawala, Katugastota.
Police investigations reveal that one of her daughters had kept her in this manner.
She had also not allowed any of her other siblings to take care of their mother and instead had chosen to keep her mother in her house. Investigations into the case were launched after one of her sons had lodged a complaint with the Central Province DIG Mahinda Ekanayake.
The police also report that they found worms on the body of the old woman and on her bed, as her faeces and urine had not been cleaned from her body for months.
The mother had been kept in a closed, dark room in the house and when police officers found her, she had gestured to them, asking for food.
She has three sons and three daughters but one of the daughters had chosen to keep the mother with her and not allowed any of the siblings to visit.
Gamini Ratnayake, the son who lodged the complaint with the police informed them that his sister had kept their mother in such a state in order to get a property owned by the old lady, transferred to her name.
Further, the suspect has also not allowed any of the neighbours to feed her mother. Sub Inspector, Sumithra and her team had conducted the raid on the advice of Women and Children Bureau OIC, Police Inspector, Janaki Seneviratne and they had taken steps to clean the old woman up and provide her with medical treatment.

I met you so many yearsago , at a picnic you were there when I saw youMy heart went pang and that time little realizing I had started a journey longI walked up to you to see you smiled and you looked at me with mischievous eyesAnd handed me a cup of tea ,this was the first of billions of cups you would hand me my loveIt took some time to realize the pang was love and my first loveIt was my greatest joy to hear you say Dennis I loved from at first sight .But the romance was taboo and many tried to break our bondIt was then we realized our strong bond would never dieWhen they would not compromise ,We left to face the world togetherWhen you left Chrissie you were crying but never did you look back my loveHer pain would not die because she lost so muchBut I proved strong and so did she now all united happy as could beI became the best son in law her dad and the rest accepted usMy mother Ann met us at the door , she listened and she gave her blessingShe asked Chrissie are you hungry dear ,while Chrissie ate she stitched a gownActually the only woman I loved before was my mother AnnAn on the fifteenth of May Chrissie became my wife , we were so happyThen five children did we two have , and now we were complete.With our little bundles of joy ,growing up till an accidentDid shatter our lives we were lives, My darling RuvaniWas crushed but not down shared our livesleft us twenty years later now she is with Chrissie in the starsMy Chrissie did you not promise me , one day we would die togetherI had made all my plans to be with you now I in the dark and lonely too.Then GOD made a miracle when my three children did step inWith all their love the dark got better . Im sure you made sureNow I sit in the dark some times I close my eyesAnd there you are now by my side again laughing and talkingLike we first met Its like though you never left me leftI will be joining you Chrissie soon and this timeMy darling we will never part

Hospitality instead of hostility
Everyone is eagerly awaitingThe oncoming new yearEagerly hoping to eraseThe past bitter memoriesAnd hurt feelingsThere is no doubtTo lead a happy life is everybodys wishBut to our dismayJoy and happiness flee form usShattering our hopeful dreams.Why In a beautiful countryWhere a friendly people were readyTo give a quick smileEven to a total strangerIn now fast fading.There was a timeRelatives and friends were welcomeA cup of tea, a chew of betelLinked with beautiful reminiscencesKept people attached, bound one anotherIn an amazingly wonderful way.Though with a few facilitiesThey saved timeTime for their loved ones, beloved onesAnd the world became a place of joy to live.But todayWith more and more facilitiesMan has alienated from one anotherAnd humanity and human relationshipsHave eroded making us pathetically stranded.So instead of just existing, lacking loveLets liveLive to the brimEliminating hostilityAnd nurturing hospitalityWith delicate care.So, instead of keeping a blind eye to the needyLets spare a few coins, some timeFor the less privilegedInstead of hoarding moneyAnd die money unusedLeaving the money for the undeservedLets give a helping hand to the needyLets make a depressed person relievedBy giving him a helping handAn encouraging word, a welcome gesture.

Ode to a newborn
To thee, my Little PrincessI offer this garland of love.Eager we were over the last few months,Yet so happy and excited, to see you,Revel in your own domainSecure, nourished and growing.At last the day dawned,Leaving your abode of nine monthsThe day you were to arrive.Your kith and kin of three generationsWith anxiety written on their facesLost in their own thoughts waited.Why should there be such a long waitThrough the rose pink clouds,Emerged the bright rim of the sunEver so slowly it rose higher,Dispelling the darkness of the rain clouds.Heralding a bright and sunny morning.We cast away the thoughts of suspense and fearGripping our mindsWe exchanged merely glances or a faint smileAs we faced the prolonged critical moments.Then startling all of usA long breathless cryCame floating in the air.Wrapped up in a pink blanketTo ward off the chill of a strange worldYou arrived.Now I hold you in the curve of my arm,Your rosy cheeks against my bosom.How fortunate an I to behold youThee, my great grand daughter!With a smile hovering over thine lips,Sleep on my Little Princess.Sunila Nanayakkara
Flickering Thoughts on a New Year
A New year means another lease of lifeTo rectify past mistakes-blunders, omissions commissionsTo turn over a new leaf with resolution and determinationAnd persevere despite odds.Its yet another chance God gifts to us to amend.Life is a one time offer given to usTo make the best use ofFor we pass this way but once.We know not whats in store for us with every passing yearIt may be yet another chanceIt may verily be the lastCome what may, whatever the future holdsWe can face it;Trusting that the Lord holds usIn the hollow of his handAnd all is well be it life or deathFor He is the Resurrection and the LifeThe Promise of eternal life.

In praise of Mother Earth
The original is in Tamil  a very brief beautiful short story written in an innovative style by Mullaithivyan, a youngster from Mullaitivu. It is professionally translated into Sinhala by Ananda Ruhunuhewa, into English by Gerard Robuchon and Patricia Melander and into French again by Gerard Robuchon.
The translations have different titles as understood by the respective perception of the translators. For instance, the writer in Tamil calls his story-Thai (Mother) Nilam (Land). And the Sinhala title is Mihikathage Daruwo and the French translators connect it as Les Enfanrts du Terroir.
The Tamil community, particularly those in the North of Lanka should thank Dr Gerard Robuchon for promoting young writers in the North to develop an aesthetic engagement in literature, films and the fine arts and of course promoting French Culture among the people in the peninsula.
The book is published by Alliance Franoise de Jaffna at No 61 Kachcheri-Nallur Road, Yaalpaanam (Jaffna)
Before I come to the short story I have some other information. One is artists from Maddakkalappu (Batticaloa), Thirukonamalai (Trincomalee) from the east and Mahanuwara (Kandy) in the central hills.
The black-and-white illustrations are by Susiman Rinoshan, Ramanathan Parilogthan, Selvarasa Thivakar and Sundararajan Thulanjani Nirosha
The colour paintings are by Patricia Melander who has lived in U K, France, Yaalpaanam and Matara.
The second important aspect of this 76-page book is three distinguished writers who are known internationally have written an afterword to this book. They are indomitable poet and writer- Jean Arasanayagam, a fearless creative writer, Manuka Wijesinghe and the director of Yaalpaanam Alliance Franoise, Gerard Robuchon.
To know what this book about lets take a little time to read a few excerpts from what they have written:
Mullaithivyans short story is a poignant story of two women who emerge against the backdrop of a particular landscape in the aftermath of war and violence in the Northern part of Sri Lanka. More (Jean Arasanayagam)
Mullaithivyan is not a writer; he is the breath of new wind that blows through the scorching heat of the Northern Peninsula. More. (Manuka Wijesinghe)
Mullathivyan is a writer, a real writer because he has style. And I like his style very much- efficient, and making the writing beautiful and powerful. A message is none without a style in literature. More (Gerard Robuchon). I like the last point very much.
So this is a collective work.
Here are some passages I selected for your reading pleasure. I take the passages from the English translation.
Mullaithivyan opens his story with this:
I walk through the tracks of red soil while a cool breeze from the North caresses my body. Here, the most prominent among all the trees are the jackfruit tree. The place is called Thanni Urru at Mulliyavalai and this means good water. Mulliyavalai is the beautiful village where Yarlmoli lives.
He continues with the description of the surroundings towards Yarlmolis house. The narrator of this passage is another woman whose name is Maanvili.
Maanvili reminds us of how she was saved by Yarlmoli when the former was hit by shelling during the war. Read the relevant paragraph:
The time I was wounded in the shelling, she (Yarlmoli) dragged me and gave me water to drink. Then she helped carry me into the ambulance. It feels as if it was only yesterday.
Oh, you must read to know what had been their lives tortured by both the warring stupid elements, who lost the sense of love for the humankind.

Public requested to donate blood
The National Blood Transfusion Service and the National Blood Transfusion Centre appeal to the general public to donate blood as much as they can to meet the countrys demand for blood.
Director of the Centre Dr. Rukshan Bellana said decreasing in the number of blood donators was evident during January to April every year.
The public can donate blood to the centre at the Narahenpita Junction, Colombo 5 (TP No. 0112369931- 4, http://www.nbts.health.gov.lk/) or to the blood bank of the nearest state hospital. A donor can donate blood once in every four months and one donors blood can save three lives.
While saving many lives, donating blood improves the donors overall cardiovascular health. It enhances producing new blood cells and reduces the cancer risks. It also helps burns calories, medical experts point out.

## Title: The question of federalism
## Supertitle: Can the Belgian model be applied to Sri Lanka:
## Section: Features
## Date: Wednesday, January 10, 2018 - 01:00
Can the Belgian model be applied to Sri Lanka:
The question of federalism
Belgium is only about half the size of Sri Lanka. Her population too is about half of Sri Lanka. Belgium has many deeply rooted linguistic groups, unlike Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka has only two linguistic groups, Sinhalese and Tamils. Muslims in Sri Lanka speak either Sinhalese or Tamil.
Brussel, the capital city of Belgium is bilingual though the majority are speaking French.
In Belgium, two major language groups exist, Dutch and Flemish about 55% and the French about 44%. There is also a tiny German-speaking community, concentrated in the region, bordering Luxembourg to 1%.
Belgium Constitution is flexible and provides effective representation to each ethnic group.
In 1970, Belgium was unitary. A successful change from unitary decentralized State to a successful federal structure was made constitutionally and nonviolently. The majority never jumped to crush the demands of the minority by violence, bloodshed or communal riots. No one ever argued that federal structure would lead to separation. Five decades had passed since the change to federalism but no part of Belgium had attempted to go for separation.
Belgium Constitution is designed in such a way to provide economic and cultural regional autonomy.
Belgium was asymmetrical but not providing asymmetry between the powers of different Regions or Communities. It applies to the asymmetry of Belgium Federation System. However, Regional and Community Jurisdictions have evolved asymmetrically.
Belgium has now provided a high degree of devolution and decentralization. Federal and Regional Laws are par with each other but only subordinate to the Constitution.
Plea of Federalism
It is a well-known fact that in or about 1926 the Kandyan Sinhalese wanted federalism. In the same year, S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike, the most productive politician of the then Ceylon, has proclaimed a thousand and one objections could be raised against the system but, when the objections are dissipated, I am convinced that some form of Federal Formula be the only solution. These prophetic words still ring in the ears of the 21st Century.
For several years many of the elites have advanced a solution based on federal formula stating that it would end the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Even the Agreement signed between the Government of Sri Lanka and LTTE in 2002, known as Oslo Declaration was to address the ethnic conflict on the line of federalism and internal self-determination. It was a significant development but abandoned by the government after the hour of victory.
New Constitution
The structure of the proposed new Constitution should be a Federal Form of Government like in Belgium or any other federal model with suitable modifications and adaptations, satisfactory to the needs of Sri Lanka, or for a combination of Unitary and Quasi-Federal form of government, like the Indian model with powers equal to the Tamil Nadu Government or implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution without exception and dilution in any manner whatsoever, or for a Unitary System of Government, we can have the Scotland model  A Parliament should be established for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces as one political unit with extensive powers as enjoyed by Scotland Parliament.
The Tamils want power-sharing process and the economic development to take place simultaneously, side by side without effecting a change of demographic situation of the Tamil population, living in the Northern and Eastern Provinces.
What Tamils want
In fact, the Sri Lankan Tamils are yearning for a political solution, aspiring for recognition that they are a distinct nationality. They were so recognized by;
(i) Colonial powers, more so, the British recognized them as a Nation. From 1911 to 1920, the Tamils were treated in the Legislative Council on an equal footing with the Sinhalese despite their numerical inferiority. Professor K.M. de Silva states in the political jargon of the day, there were two majority communities, the Sinhalese and Tamils, and the minorities were the other smaller groups. The situation changed fundamentally after 1922 instead of two majority communities and the minorities, there was one majority community, the Sinhalese. The Tamils now regarding themselves increasingly a minority community.
(ii) The Kandyan Memorandum to the Donoughmore Commission recognized them so,
(iii) When the Sinhala Leaders breached the Written Agreement entered into with Sir Pon. Arunachalam on 07.12.1918, they proclaimed so loudly that the Tamils were a Nation though less in numerical strength unlike the Sinhalese, and they required no safeguards or privileges,
(iv) The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of July 29, 1987, recognized that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces have been areas of historical habitation of Sri Lankan Tamil speaking peoples.
The Tamils want Recognition that the Northern and the Eastern Provinces should form as one political unit. It was so recognized by;
i) The Kandyan Memorandum to the Donoughmore Commission recognized the Northern and the Eastern Provinces as one Tamil linguistic federal unit,
ii) Bandaranaike  Chelvanayagam (BC) Pact was signed in 1956. BC Pact provided one Autonomous Regional Council for the Northern Province and two or more for the Eastern Province. In the Eastern Province, the Tamils and the Muslims were by necessary implication, elevated with the Sinhalese as nationals. Thus, BC Pact had created three Nationals within one State, and
iii) The Indo-Sri Lanka Agreement of July 29, 1987.
The power-sharing process had to be implemented from the Centre to the periphery. Once powers are identified, defined and devolved, they should not be abridged, reduced, taken away or diluted in any manner whatsoever, and the concept of a fully fledged internal self-determination should be provided without hindrance to develop their areas on all grounds.
The structure of the proposed new Constitution should be a Federal Form of Government like in Belgium or any other federal model with suitable modifications and adaptations, satisfactory to the needs of Sri Lanka, or for a combination of Unitary and Quasi-Federal form of government, like the Indian model with powers equal to the Tamil Nadu Government or implement the 13th Amendment to the Constitution without exception and dilution in any manner whatsoever, or for a Unitary System of Government, we can have the Scotland model  A Parliament should be established for the Northern and the Eastern Provinces as one political unit with extensive powers as enjoyed by Scotland Parliament.
Constitutional Amendment
Upon a new Constitution being promulgated, and if it is to alter, amend or repeal any of its provisions, there should be a 2/3rd majority of the whole members of Parliament. However, where the rights of the Tamils or the Muslims were to be affected, there should be a 2/3rd majority of the Tamil members and/or of the Muslim Members of Parliament together with the two-third members of the Tamils and/or the Muslims of the Provincial Councils of the Northern and Eastern Provinces and it should have been strictly adhered. This provision should be incorporated in the Constitution itself.
If the proposed new Constitution is intended to resolve a permanent settlement of all political issues and make Sri Lanka a truly democratic country of the people, by the people and for the people, then all the rights of all the communities, who have decided to live with the dominant group, should be carefully protected and nurtured in all political units without exception. All citizens living therein should be afforded with unfettered opportunities to live in equality, safety and harmony, prosper and exercise their sovereignty and to enjoy internal self-determination in all their rights, Muslims should be recognized as a distinct nationality. They were already recognized so under the BC Pact, Hill Country Tamils should be recognized as a distinct community and they should be afforded with unfettered opportunities to live in equality, safety and harmony, prosper and exercise their sovereignty and to enjoy internal self-determination in the areas of their habitation.
Aboriginal roots
The new Constitution had to address not only the Belgium model or any other model but also it had to address the political rights of the aborigin's of the country.
Parker who was attached to Irrigation Department of then Ceylon from 1873 to 1904 had written a book, titled Ancient Ceylon, in which he had vividly described the ancient civilization of the country, tracing with the Aborigin's of the country, namely Veddhas. He has done a deep analytical study of the Veddhas, having visited the deep interior thick forests many times and met them and had collected their names, males and females, the skulls of the deceased Veddhas, and scientifically identified their groups. He had classed the Veddhas into three groups, to wit: Deep Forest Veddhas, Village Veddhas and Tamil Speaking Veddhas.
I am quoting verbatim from his book for the readers to appreciate and understand the Veddhas language as Parker described in his book.
He says the Vaedi dialect is to a great extent the colloquial Sinhalese tongue, but is slightly changed in form and accent. Yet closely resembles the latter, these differences and the manner in which it is pronounced render it quite an unknown language when it is spoken to one who has not a special acquaintance with it.
Besides this, the Vaeddhas use their own terms for the wild animals and some other things about which they often find it necessary to converse. Such words are usually a form of Sinhalese or admit of Sinhalese or Tamil derivations: but a very few may possibly belong to, or be modifications of words in, their original language, forming, with perhaps a few forms of grammatical expression, the only remains of it that have been preserved, with the exception of some doubtful terms found in Sinhalese.
Veddhas are ancient people, living in Sri Lanka with the dawn of human habitation. Still, they preserve their distinct culture and distinct area of habitation.
The voice, culture, custom and language of the Aboriginal people of Sri Lanka, Veddhas should be recognized, promoted, nursed and protected. Their culture, customs and usages should be propagated and nurtured and enshrined in the Constitution.
The Bintana area had to be assigned to them. All their rights should be carefully protected and nurtured. An electorate should be carved out to make their representation in Parliament. Local bodies, such as Town Council, Pradesha Sabha should be created to enshrine their rights.
In the event of the new Constitution rejecting, ignoring or failing to address the political grounds of the Tamils, this island would certainly leap once again into a deep mire. Past events had to be the future lessons.

SL Karting, from humble  beginning to 1st CIK event
Sri Lanka will reach another milestone in motor sports when the country's first ever international Karting event will be conducted at the expanded Bandaragama Karting Circuit on January 13 and 14.
The event is sanctioned by the world Karting governing body, Commision Internationale de Karting (CIK) affiliated to Fdration Internationale de l'Automobile (FIA) and some of the world's top Karters will be in action at the IAME X30 Championship round in Sri Lanka.
Sri Lanka's oldest and only FIA affiliated motor sports club, Ceylon Motor Sports Club (CMSC) in association with David David Peiris Motor Company (DPMC) share the pride of hosting this milestone event in Sri Lanka on newly upgraded Bandaragama trakc which will now ready to host international standard Karting events. According to the organizers, the new track is truly spectacular and will offer a great challenge to the drivers.
Go-Karting (or Karting as its commonly known) is an entry level form of the sport which offers great thrills and challenges as the driver sits just millimeters from the ground, and compared to other forms of motoring, totally exposed to the elements.
Karting in Sri Lanka goes back to the early 1980s when the CMSC brought down 6 karts from Bill Sisley in the UK.
Initially these Karts all had 125cc motor cycle engines, which with the kind help of the Cinnamon Gardens Police Station, were raced in a cordoned off area around Independence Square.
As interest in the sport grew, the CMSC decided to run two separate classes  one for the 125cc motor cycle engine Karts, the other for the internationally recognized class of 100cc 2 stroke. The latter was made possible with the assistance of Frank Perera who was then working in Oman, and this connection culminated in the CMSC inviting a team of drivers from Dubai to participate.
With no track to race on, the first option was the Car Park at Isurupaya, where the Ministry of Education was then housed.
Through the kind intervention of then Education Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe approval was obtained for the inaugural event.
Isurupaya continued to be the venue for a few more events, and thereafter the racing moved to the car park of the Taj Samudra Hotel, the BMICH, Pegasus Reef Hotel and what was Alcatras restaurant opposite the current Parliament building.
During this period, a team of Sri Lankan Karters were invited to participate in Dubai and the interest in Karting was growing amongst Sri Lankans.
With over 30 active Karts in play there was a dire need for a purpose built track, both for safety and for facilitating the sport.
One of the regular Karters at the time was Rohan De Silva, who took on the great initiative to build and operate the Speed Drome in Battaramulla. This location was a huge step forwards for the sport as there was finally a dedicated place for the sport. Its pertinent to mention here that many F1 drivers have started their career in Karting making
this truly the cradle of Motor Sports. Incidentally Eshan Pieris who is currently a front runner in the Asian Circuits is one of those who began his racing at Speedrome. As many will know, we now have the Sri Lanka Karting Circuit at Bandaragama operated by the inimitable David Peiris of DPMC. Peiris is no stranger to the motoring fraternity in Sri Lanka.

SLIM gains silver at CA Annual Report Awards, runner up at NBEA Awards 2017
For the very first time the Sri Lanka Institute of Marketing (SLIM) competed in the 53rd Annual Report Awards conducted by the Institute of Chartered Accountants of Sri Lanka and emerged with a silver award in the Not for Profit Organizations in the Non-Governmental Organizations category. Also for the first time, SLIM clinched the Runner Up Award in the Associations and Societies Category at the 14th National Business Excellence Awards 2017 organised by the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka.
Both awards signify SLIM's long strategies in building an entity that aims towards performance and operational excellence, where stringent adherence to compliance and standards lie paramount in its ethos. SLIM has been producing comprehensive annual reports according to the accounting standards by CA Sri Lanka for many years now, which emphasize this focus. However, this is the first time that it submitted a report to be scrutinised and evaluated against those guidelines, resulting in the reward of silver at this prestigious event.
Over 140 organisations ranging from blue chip companies and conglomerates to small and medium businesses to community groups vie for laurels at the Annual Report competition, where an eminent panel of judges work on evaluation criteria that has best practices in governance and stringent appraisals of the entities transparency, accountability and social responsibility in financial reporting. At the NBEA Awards, SLIM was among 92 award winners across 29 business sectors, which has become the symbol of excellence for the crme de la crme of business in Sri Lanka.
The evaluation criteria is embedded on a platform of seven excellence criteria based on leadership, corporate governance, capacity building, performance management, local and global market reach, CSR and environmental sustainability and business and financial results.
Assessing the unprecedented wins for SLIM, President Karthik Elangovan opined that these awards further augment the stability, strength and sustainability that the organization espouses in the way it conducts its business.
For one, a credible annual report entails a great deal of clarity in the presentation of financial and non-financial information and that is what SLIM has striven to do by conforming to the highest reporting standards and we have been suitably rewarded for it too. In being recognised for excellence, the best practices we infuse, our value creation on governance, deeper insights and remarkable growth, and our contribution as the national marketing body to the country's ambitious development goals are all highlighted. These not only spur us to augment what we have achieved but also paves the way for others to emulate these best practices and strive for excellence.
This year's Annual Report Awards, which revolved on the theme Quintessence of Eminence highlighted entities that have gone beyond the norms of mere financial performance, which makes this win even more significant.

Sri Lanka U19 lose warm-up to Australia
Australia, who have lifted the ICC Under 19 Cricket World Cup trophy three times put up a strong display on the second day of the warm-up matches defeating Sri Lanka by 53 runs at Hagley Oval on Tuesday.
Australia had a good outing as most of their players came good with either bat or ball. They got runs through opener Jack Edwards (50) and Jonathan Merlo, who smashed four fours and four sixes during his knock of 78.
The total of 251 for seven in 50 overs was easily defended as all-rounders Will Sutherland and Jason Rolston made good use of the seaming conditions to finish with three wickets each, while Austin Waugh, son of Steve Waugh, picked up two wickets as Sri Lanka were dismissed for 198 in 42.5 overs.
Sri Lanka were 64 for six in the 17th over and it took an 84-run seventh-wicket partnership between Hasith Boyagoda (69) and Ashen Bandara (51) to lift the Asian side to a decent score.

Sydney Opera House: Iconic colosseum of imagination and creativity
My first view on Sydney Opera House made me profusely proud of human imagination and creativity not in uncertain terms. It also prides a thespian nation who naturally boasts of many a connoisseur as proved to me on my month-long sojourn in the land of kangaroos. In my silent reflections, my whole stay on this land of myriad perspectives was a fruitful experience that humbled a lion by a kangaroo.
It is said The sun did not know how beautiful its light was until it reflected off this building.
By any yardstick, Sydney Opera House doesnt seem to play second fiddle to any such manmade coliseum. This preamble would prompt you to go deeper not only into the process of erection of this great monumental edifice but also the architectural genius behind this world heritage masterpiece. The great name was cemented in the history of mankind in 2007 and ever since the unending crowds of thespian pilgrims have been thronging this hallowed site with great reverence to human imagination.
Groundbreaking design
The glittering atmosphere of Sydney was enhanced with immense beauty to a new height with the addition of Sydney Opera House through the groundbreaking design masterminded by the Danish Architect John Utzon. It is another story to be unfolded because of its dramatic significance. The whole drama starts with the unprecedented flow of entries sent for this great human endeavour of a bullion standard. It was an international competition among the members of a target group of high calibre and there had been 232 entries altogether.
The creation of a performing arts centre of this stature is quite a formidable feat of architectural and engineering acumen. The Danish architect John Utzon merged the winner and human history of connoisseurs were sealed and it was in the hand of another fellow human being on planet earth for which Australia could claim credit. This gigantic project has taken fourteen long years for its completion with the labour of 10,000 workers.
The calculated number of roof tiles had been 1,056,006. The budgetary allocations have been naturally wide, but the Australian government has not taken any foot backwards in this great task for which the human population on planet earth owes a huge debt to them for giving a delicious treat to the eyes. Yet, another gloomy fact connected with the episode is that the architectural mastermind of the project Utzon has ironically resigned himself before the culmination of the erection. But, the kangaroo dream was finally realized in 1973.
Mechanical action
Opera House consists of a multifaceted collection of performing arts centres. The Concert Hall ranks prominently among them. Its significance is paramount because of the very fact that it houses the worlds largest mechanical action organ. Its remarkability further enhances in the fact that there is only one craftsman in the world who is able to tune it. It boasts of 10,154 pipes.
The completion of this structure has taken a long period of ten years. It could provide seating facilities to 2,679 people. The high vaulted ceiling and the wooden panelling combine to give the maximum possible support for the best performances by the world-renowned artist of Michael Jacksons calibre. It is also the home for resident performing companies such as Sydney Symphony Orchestra and The Australian Chamber Orchestra.
The Forecourt is another addition to this great structure and in 1996 a recorded crowd of more than 100,000 people have gathered there for a house concert of global fame. It is of universal acclaim as the queen of the most picturesque outdoor performing spaces the world has ever seen. Nelson Mandela after having completed his long walk to freedom has addressed a mammoth gathering here in 1990 immediately after his release. The Joan Sutherland Theatre is a glowing tribute to La Stupenda, the legendary Australian soprano of voice of the century fame. Initially, the venue was known as Opera Theatre but it was renamed as above in 2012. It ranks the second largest venue in the array and 76 musicians and 1507 viewers could be comfortably accommodated in it.The year-round musical performances taking place here speak volumes for its significance and popularity among the theatregoers. The specific form of the theatre plays the role of a catalyst in giving a superb experience of fine musicality.
Everything theoretical
The Drama Theatre goes parallel to the other sources of entertainment in SYDNEY OPERA HOUSE that houses almost everything theoretical under the sun. With 544 seating facilities, the drama theatre caters to the aesthetic desires of the robust theatre lovers. It has become a holy site for the theatre lovers with the treading of the iconic artists such as Sir Ian McKellen, Toni Colette, Sylvie Guillem, Mel Gibson and Hugo Weaving. The Playhouse is mainly associated with art and Australian beach culture. The 1970s was a remarkable decade for surf movies because of the screening of very many movies related to the glowing sphere in the playhouse.
It was the main venue for them. The target is often the younger generation. Storytelling, dance and theoretical experiments are the core aspects of generating creativity and interest among the posterity. The national objectives are long ranged. The place is now used for relaxation. The Studio is a major attraction as it is a fine combination of sound, light and seating systems. The worlds most daring performances find The Studio as an ideal venue. Originally, it had been a library. Its flexibility enables the theatre lovers to use it for diverse productions. While the morning session is devoted to children from age two, the evening is for an aesthetically mature adult generation. Cabaret and circus act performed here to cater to the delight of the art lovers. It has been designed to seat 300 people and the beautiful experiences the visitors gain to keep them glued to the place.
Great edifice
Utzon Room has a story of itself to unfold. The greatness of the architect is inscribed in the following words. Jorn Utzon, the chief architect of the great edifice, was asked whether he would be happy to have this room named after him. He has said that it could be the greatest honour he could ever receive.
The present Utzon Room is the only completed inner design under his belt according to the accessible evidence. The vibrant design of the tapestry of the western wall is a single honour for him. 200 people could be seated in it and the Sydney harbour and the Botanic garden could be viewed to please the eye. The chamber music performances here reverberate the wellspring of genuine creativity of the colossus architect. The cultural vibrancy of a nation is best epitomized by the Sydney Opera House. Could I humbly claim that this edifice belongs to the whole mankind yet with great respect to Australians to whom we have a huge debt for giving our eyes a great feast

Thirteen dead amid California heavy rains and mudslides

Emergency services said a number of people are unaccounted for and they expect the death toll to rise.
Thousands fled the deluge and more than 50 rescues have been performed.
The hardest hit homes were those that were not in the evacuation zone, officials say.
Heavy rain run-off caused mudflow in the community of Montecito, where some homes were knocked from their foundations, said Santa Barbara County Fire Department spokesman Mike Eliason.
Boulders the size of small cars were rolling down hillsides and blocking roads, reports BBC News Los Angeles correspondent James Cook.
Among those taken to safety was a 14-year-old girl who had been trapped for hours in the ruins of her home.
The fire department published a picture of the girl encased in mud as she was led to safety.
County Fire Captain Dave Zaniboni said that five people were found dead on Tuesday in Montecito and may have been killed as result of the storm.
The upmarket neighbourhood includes homes owned by celebrities such as actor Rob Lowe and chat show host Ellen DeGeneres.
Oprah Winfrey also has a property in Montecito that is reportedly worth nearly $90m (66m).
The US Coast Guard has sent "multiple airships to support rescue operations" and warn the public not to fly drones, otherwise the flights will force to be grounded.
Wildfires in December, including the Thomas Fire, swept through the area burning vegetation that helps prevent flooding and landslides.
Thousands of California residents were asked to evacuate on Monday for the second time in two months.
In Burbank, where waves of mud swept away vehicles, officials issued a mandatory evacuation order.
Homeowners in the area shared photos of mud in their homes.
Several roads are closed due to mudslides and debris, including the major thoroughfare Highway 101.
After a wildfire, burned vegetation and charred soil create a water repellent layer which blocks water absorption and leads to an increased risk of mudslides and floods.
"Recent burn areas will be especially vulnerable where dangerous mud and debris flows are possible," said the National Weather Service in a statement.
The Federal Emergency Management Agency shared a warning for California homeowners explaining that homes that had never flooded before were now at risk.
About 30,000 residents were under evacuation orders on Monday.
This comes after arecord-setting year of $306bn (226bn) of weather and climate-related disaster costsin the United States, the third warmest year on record, according to the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.
The storm over California is expected to produce 4 inches to 7 inches (10 to 18 cm) in the foothills and 9in (23cm) in select areas.
Snow is falling at higher elevations, according to the National Weather Service.

Unity Government achievements
The Unity Government, which was voted into power in 2015, has made several strides in various aspects of governancefrom rescuing the economy and restoring peoples confidence in the judiciary to empowering law enforcement agencies.
In his message commemorating three years since coming to power, Prime Minister Ranil
Wickremesinghe noted that while there is still much left for the government to accomplish, it has nonetheless been able to achieve feats that would have been unthinkable under a different regime.
The Unity Government has implemented the 17th amendment to the Constitution, giving life to the Constitutional Council and Independent Commissions which allow the police, judiciary, and public service at large to act according to their conscience and not the whims of the political masters of the day, he said.
We have passed legislation enshrining the right to information for all citizens and the right to assistance and protection for those citizens who are victims of crimes or witnesses before the law.
Below are some of the notable tangible achievements of the Unity Government since it came in to power.
