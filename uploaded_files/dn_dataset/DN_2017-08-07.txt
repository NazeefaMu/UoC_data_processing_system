We will not protect rogues"
The Government will not protect anybody found guilty of fraud and corruption, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe stressed.
He made this comment with reference to latest developments at the Presidential Commission of Inquiry (PCoI) on Bond issues.
Addressing a gathering in Hatton yesterday, the Premier said, If proven guilty we will not hesitate to take action against wrongdoers. Ours is not a party of thieves. If thieves do exist, we will remove them, but let us do so after transparent and proper investigations.
If anybody had committed wrongdoing or uttered lies that person will be expelled once the report comes out. Under special reasons we can ask any person to resign in the middle of investigations too, the Premier noted.
When there were allegations about the Bond issue, we first set up an internal committee.
Then we allowed COPE to conduct an investigation. Although we won the Parliamentary election, an opposition MP was appointed as the Chairman of COPE. Later, a Presidential Commission was appointed.
We have developed an open and transparent system where the Attorney General can question our ministers. Did this happen before Had the Attorney Generals Department tried this before, its officials would have been white-vanned.
Today, our system is similar to that of the US. Some members of the Trump administration are being investigated. If proven guilty, they will be expelled. Under special circumstances, some resign while the investigations are underway. We have now established the same system here, the Prime Minister said.
So, dont steal. If you steal, you will be exposed, he added.
Wickremesinghe pointed out that open and transparent governance has been assured by making vital institutional changes such as empowering Parliamentary watchdog committees and independent commissions.
People elected us into power expecting a just and corruption free society. If we fail to do that we will lose votes at the next election. We cannot solicit the votes of the rogues. We do not have a history of covering up corruption. We will do the needful as the right time comes. Now the system is in place that those committing wrongdoing will be under spotlight. We have a system similar to the US and UK now, he remarked.
The Prime Minister said the media-at large cannot talk about the misappropriations of the previous government, as they covered them up in the past.
Almost all the print and electronic media stations toed the line. What happened to Lasantha Wickrematunga and Prageeth Eknaligoda who went on to expose their acts of corruption Today, the Rajapaksa supporters say we should not investigate into their deaths as it will jeopardize national security.
We challenge the media institutions that protected the Rajapaksa regime to run this story as a headline. I know none of them will do so, he said.

Anuradhapura people undergo severe water shortage
Anuradhapura Government Agent R.M. Wanninayake said people must use drinking water economically as lack of water has become a national issue now.
He appealed to the public not to use pipe-borne water and other water sources for gardening, watering flower plants, and washing vehicles at this critical junction.
The drought has severely affected over three lakhs of people in the Anuradhapura district.
Police stations, hospitals, sacred places, schools and other public agencies in the district receive water mainly from the Nuwarawewa, Tissawewa and Thuruwila tanks.
Nuwarawewa supplies 13,500 cubic meters of purified water and, Thuruwila 19,000 and Tisawewa 6,000. The tanks supply water for the yala cultivation as well. The water levels in major tanks are dwindling rapidly due to the drought, Wanninayake said.
The water being sent from the Nuwarawewa and other major tanks through Kalawewa to the relevant destinations for cultivating and drinking was taken stealthily by some parties, sources said.
Police officers will be deployed to protect water canals that provide water to Anuradhapura from Kalawewa, he said. The Mahaweli Authority and the Mahaweli Water Management Committee have been requested to release 500 a.f Mahaweli water to Nuwarawewa though Kalawewa and Nachchaduwa for drinking purposes.
Wanninayake said divisional secretaries were instructed to provide the affected families with 20,000 packets of dry food starting from this week.

Dedicated to Nandasena Ratnapala
We meet and we part
In this journey through Sansara
But the meeting or parting does not end with time or years
It's a long stretch of an eventful road
Where milestones matter more than rises or falls
We have travelled together on this hard and endless road
The journey was not smooth nor full of magical moments alone
But many achievements reached more worth than monuments in gold
Leaving a fragrance that would linger on and unfold
Gifting a memory of a life rich and rare
Now you are gone as you wished on a fateful morn
While family, students and friends remember and mourn
A warm tear drops none would see or feel
As I ponder about you, while memory unfolds your sight

She was a marvel
It was during my time as a Teacher Educator at the Bolawalana Training College that Dr. Thilokasundari Kariyawasam was appointed Director of Teacher Training. I was a novice at the the time, not knowing how to handle teachers, especially of primary schools.
Dr. Kariyawasam started her activities by organizing several teacher education seminars. It was a quick programme; one in every three months. I attended all of them.
At that time, the 1984 reforms in education had to be implemented with new concepts. This was explained by her so well, basing her knowledge on Piaget's Development to Psychology.
She spoke so fluently in both Sinhala and English, without referring to notes. She was a marvel to listen to. She spoke with much practical experience as a teacher, principal and director. Teachers who understood the new concepts, as explained by Dr. Kariyawasam, got into the spirit of doing simple projects with children. They loved it and they learned to think independently, which is sadly neglected in today's education.
Thank you Dr. Kariyawasam for giving us such valuable guidance in teacher education.
May you attain the bliss of Nirvana.

## Title: Arahant Maha Kassapa : Leading figure behind First Dhamma Council
## Supertitle:

Arahant Maha Kassapa : Leading figure behind First Dhamma Council
What remains to be said about Maha Kassapa's relation to Ananda is closely connected with his leading role in the Sangha after the passing away of the Buddha. At the demise of the Buddha, only two of the five most prominent disciples were present, the brothers Ananda and Anuruddha. Sariputta and Maha Moggallana had preceded the Master in death and Maha Kassapa, with a large company of monks, was just then wandering on the high-road from Pava to Kusinara. During that walk he happened to step aside from the road and sat down under a tree to rest. Just then a naked ascetic passed that way.
The ascetic had with him a Mandarava (coral tree) flower, which is said to grow only in a celestial world. When Maha Kassapa saw this, he knew that something unusual must have happened for the flower to be found on earth. He asked the ascetic whether he had heard any news about his teacher, the Buddha, and the ascetic affirmed that he had, saying: The recluse Gotama passed into Nibbana a week ago. This Mandarava flower I picked up from the place of cremation.
Among the monks who heard that message, only those who were Arahats like Maha Kassapa could remain composed and calm; but the others who were still unliberated from the passions lamented and wept: Too soon has the Blessed One passed into Nibbana! Too soon has the Eye of the World vanished from our sight!
Relics distribution
But there was one monk, Subhadda by name, who had ordained in his old age. He addressed the other monks and said: Enough, friends! Do not grieve, do not lament! We are well rid of that Great Ascetic. We have been troubled by his telling us: This is befitting, that is not befitting. Now we can do what we like, and we won't have to do what we do not like.
It is not recorded that at that time the venerable Maha Kassapa gave a reply to those callous words. He may not have wished just then to strike a discordant note by censuring the monk or having him disrobed as he deserved. Hence he remained silent. But, as we shall see later, Maha Kassapa quoted that incident when he spoke of the need for summoning a council. Now, however, he admonished his group of monks not to lament, but to remember that impermanence is the nature of all conditioned things. He then continued his journey to Kusinara, together with his monks.
Until then it had not been possible to set the funeral pyre alight as the deities present wanted to wait until the venerable Maha Kassapa came and paid his last homage to the remains of the Master. When the venerable Maha Kassapa arrived at the place of cremation, he walked twice around the pyre, reverently, with clasped hands, and then, with bowed head paid his homage at the feet of the Tathagata. When his group of monks had done likewise, the pyre, it is said, burst into flames by itself.
Hardly had the bodily remains of the Tathagata been cremated when there arose a conflict about the distribution of the relics among the lay folk assembled and those who had sent messengers later. But the venerable Maha Kassapa remained aloof in that quarrel, as did the other monks like Anuruddha and Ananda. It was a respected brahman, Dona by name, who finally divided the relics into eight portions and distributed them among the eight claimants. He himself took the vessel in which the relics had been collected.
Dhamma and Vinaya
The venerable Maha Kassapa himself brought to King Ajatasattu of Magadha his share of the relics. Having done so, he turned his thoughts to the preservation of the Master's spiritual heritage, the Teaching (Dhamma) and the Discipline (Vinaya).
The necessity to do so was demonstrated to him by Subhadda's challenge of the monastic discipline, and his advocacy of moral laxity, which Maha Kassapa took as a warning. If that attitude were to spread, it would lead to the decline and ruin of both the Sangha and the Teaching. To prevent this at the very start, Maha Kassapa proposed holding a council by which the Dhamma and Vinaya could be reliably established and secured. With that suggestion, he turned to the monks gathered at Rajagaha.
The monks agreed and at their request Maha Kassapa selected five hundred members, all but one of whom were Arahats. Ananda, however, at that time had not yet succeeded in reaching that final attainment, but as he excelled in remembering a large number of the Buddha's discourses, he too was admitted to complete the five hundred members of the First Council. All other monks were to leave Rajagaha for the duration of the council.
As the first item of the council's proceedings, the texts of the monastic discipline were recited by the venerable Upali, who was a Vinaya expert. The second item was the codification of the Teaching laid down in the discourses. Here it was Ananda who, on being questioned by the venerable Maha Kassapa, recited all those texts which were later compiled in the Five Collections (nikaya) of the Sutta Pitaka.
It was an outstanding feat of memory on his part.
Finally, some special matters concerning the Sangha were discussed. Among them, the venerable Ananda mentioned that the Buddha, shortly before his death, had permitted the abolishment of minor rules. When Ananda was asked whether he had inquired from the Buddha what these minor rules were, he had to admit that he had neglected to do so.
Now various opinions about this matter were expressed in the assembly. As there was no consensus, the venerable Maha Kassapa asked the assembly to consider that if they were to abolish rules arbitrarily, the lay followers and the public in general would reproach them for being in a hurry to relax discipline so soon after the Master's death.
Hence Maha Kassapa suggested that the rules should be preserved intact without exception. And so it was decided (Culavagga, XI).
After the holding of the First Council, the high regard in which the venerable Maha Kassapa was held grew still greater, and he was seen as the de facto head of the Sangha. His seniority would have contributed to this, as he was then one of the oldest living disciples.
Later on, the venerable Maha Kassapa handed over the Buddha's almsbowl to Ananda, as a symbol of continuing the faithful preservation of the Dhamma. Thus Maha Kassapa, who had been generally recognized in the Order as the worthiest in succession, chose on his part Ananda as being the worthiest after him.
There is no report in the Pali literature about the time and circumstances of his death.

A hunting implement used by mature homo sapiens who lived in the inland parts of the country about 4,000 to 6,000 years ago and 35 varieties of burnt edible crop seeds used by them as food were unearthed during archaeological excavations conduced in the Bat Cave in Parigahamadiththa in Balangoda, said Senior Professor Raj Somadera of the Kelaniya University Post Graduate Institute on August 6.
Speaking to the media which visited the area on an observation four, Prof. Somadera said they had been conducting research in an around Balangoda for the last 9 years regarding the early homo sapiens who lived in the inland parts of the country.
The purpose of excavations done by them was to find out the evolution of the Balangoda man so far they had found nearly 10 stone implements used by early humans who lived in these parts of the country including a hunting implement which could he used to strike animals and hunt them down.
The 35 varieties of crop seeds proved that the early man had depended on crop seeds for food which also showed their transformation from the hunting age to the agricultural age, he said.
Excavations on the Salt Cave (Hunu Galge) proved that this area had witnessed human habitation about 6,500 years ago. Excavations done in the Black cave at Meddekanda proved that the area had witnessed human habitation 5,00 years ago.
There was also evidence about the sharing of cultural habits among people living in different caves.

Colombo , August 6 (newsin.asia): The Chinese Ambassador to Sri Lanka, Yi Xianliang, on Saturday assured Sri Lankans that China will never use Sri Lankas strategic location in the Indian Ocean for its strategic and security needs, Newsin. Asia reported yesterday.
Speaking at the reception to the Chinese naval hospital ship Ark Peace at the Colombo harbor, Yi said: From over a 1,000 years ago, Sri Lanka has enjoyed its strategic location because the island is in the
middle of the silk route. However the question is how do you use your potential How do you make use of this oppo rtunity which you have The main answer is peace and development. So China will take every effort
to support Sri Lankas economic and social development. That is the need of the people of Sri Lanka. We will never use this advantage of Sri Lanka for our strategic or security needs.
We support Sri Lankas development. You can check what China has done in Sri Lanka in the past. We have built nfrastructure, hospitals, airport, harbour. Sri Lanka also is the first country to get the largest donation and financial assistance from China.
We do not have any navy soldiers or any other soldiers in Sri Lanka.
We have no intelligence in Sri Lanka. We have no such people present in Sri Lanka except the Chinese diplomats present here and I am the representative of China to Sri Lanka.
But we have so many CEOs, Engineers, businessmen, teachers,professors in Sri Lanka. What are they doing here They are
strengthening the cooperation between China and Sri Lanka and assist Sri Lanka and develop this island country and develop the economy and social affairs. We do what we say and we have kept our promise. So trust the Chinese as we are true friends of Sri Lanka, Yi said.

SAFETY OF GLYPHOSATE AS A WEEDICIDE
I would like to enlighten the Sri Lankan public and the policymakers alike about a myth and a dark cloud that shrouded over our agricultural sector costing millions of rupees and loss of agricultural productivity as a result of banning the use of Glyphosate, which was the time tested and cost effective weedicide that protected our major crops from the time immemorial. Since the banning of the use of Glyphosate as a weedicide, farmers refrained from weeding due to high labour cost and as a result, nutrients sparingly added to crop farms at a very high cost were absorbed by the weeds thereby declining the yields of almost all crops.
My thanks and appreciation to Prof. Deepal Mathew of the Biochemistry Dept. of the Faculty of Medicine, University of Colombo for a well written, research-based article that appeared in the Daily News of August 1, 2017 disproving in no uncertain terms that the myth people had about toxic effect of Glyphosate hitherto believed to be the cause for high incidence of chronic kidney failure among the farmers in the North-Central and Eastern provinces. In agri-based developed nations like New Zealand and Malaysia where they use over ten times Glyphosate per unit area, has so far not observed a single case of kidney failure (CKDu) like in the North Central province of Sri Lanka.
Founder of the science of pharmacology uttered some 500 years ago that all substances are poisonous if consumed over the lethal dosage and to indicate the lethal dosage the unit used commonly is LD 50. If the LD 50 of a substance is below 25 it is extremely poisonous. If LD 50 is between 25 and 50, it is very dangerous. Higher the LD 50 value, the substance is safer health-wise. In his article, Prof Mathew has shown that common salt sodium chloride has an LD 50 value of 3000; while the same for Glyphosate is 5000. That means the mammalian toxicity of common salt is more than that of Glyphosate.
This whole issue started with a baseless publication of a report by a Researcher without any research background on agriculture, alleging that residual Glyphosate molecules leach into the water table through tanks and streams are the cause for the report of CKDu in the province which prompted policy makers to impose the ban. Sadly what this researcher did not know is that electrostatic attraction of the phosphate ion in Glyphosate bonds firmly with the soil preventing leaching of it to water streams.
It was way back in 2015 that this unsubstantiated publication culminated with a political issue, then compelling the government to impose a total ban on its import.
The agro-economists are at a loss as to the impact the import ban had on the productivity and yield of major crops like paddy, tea, rubber and coconut with the eventual loss of revenue running into millions.
While saluting Prof. Mathew for his well-written article, I strongly believe that it will be a good eye opener to policymakers to think about imminently lifting the ban, well of course after consulting eminent and independent crop research institutions, who have ample experience in field research on the use of Glyphosate to protect the agriculture of Sri Lanka.

Deadly heat waves
Last week I made reference to the dangers facing Jaffna due to scarcity of water if left unaddressed. This week the big picture for the region is presented.
The risk of human illness and mortality increases in hot and humid weather associated with heat waves. The et-bulb temperature (TW defined as the temperature that an air parcel would attain if cooled at constant pressure by evaporating water within it until saturation is the tool to measure.
According to the global historical reanalysis for the modern record (19792015), the largest TWmax rarely exceeds 31C in the current climate. However, three extensive regions, where values exceed 28C, are observed: Southwest Asia around the Persian/Arabian Gulf and the Red Sea, South Asia in the Indus and Ganges river valleys, and Eastern China. To identify the precise reasons for high TW, individual studies need to be performed because of each regions unique geography and climate. In summer 2015, TW in the Bandar Mahshahr, Iran Persian/Arabian Gulf, reached nearly 35C, suggesting that the threshold may be breached sooner than projected.
IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE
On the basis of the simulation results, TWmax is projected to exceed the survivability threshold by the end of the century over most of South Asia, including the Ganges river valley, northeastern India, Bangladesh, the eastern coast of India, Chota Nagpur Plateau, northern Sri Lanka, and the Indus Valley of Pakistan. No regions are projected to exceed 35C; however, vast regions of South Asia are projected to experience episodes exceeding 31C, which is considered extremely dangerous for most humans. Less severe conditions, in general, are projected for the Deccan Plateau in India, the Himalayas, and western mountain ranges in Pakistan. The region stands to benefit from significant mitigation efforts, such as those pledged by COP21.
As a river dies: India could be facing its greatest human catastrophe ever.
As crops and farmers die, experts blame a man-made drought of common sense for the drying up of Southern Indias Cauvery River, once a lifeline to millions.
PEOPLE ARE LOSING HOPE
Years of scanty and inadequate rainfall have led to the drying up of water reservoirs and village water bodies in Southern India, especially the grain-growing regions of Tamil Nadu which is facing its worse drought in 140 years. Water activist Dr Rajendra Singh said: We have not seen a drought of this intensity before. People have lost hope in life and are committing suicide.
The once-mighty 800 km Cauvery River, a major lifeline in Southern India on which millions of farmers depend, has turned into dust tracks in several sections before it trickles down to the Bay of Bengal.
Scientist and environmentalist Dr Vandana Shiva pointed out that the region gets only four months of rain during the monsoons, during which in ideal circumstances, the water would be naturally stored in the humus and earth of the forests.
But if you dont store it, the rain comes, causes a flood, and you have a drought, she said. The second reason is that there is an over extraction (of water) beyond the capacity of the river. That extraction is leaving the river dry.
SMALL RIVERS DRYING UP
Dr Shiva also blames the governments ambitious scheme that aims to link Indian rivers by a network of reservoirs and canals, with dams diverting the flow from areas with a water surplus. She said: Theres this assumption that you can have bigger and bigger cities and you can divert water from hundreds and thousands of miles away.
To take all the rivers in India and divert them to the cities and industrial areas - all rivers will die. Critics argue that damming the rivers will cause coastal erosion, deforestation and the displacement of people, and exacerbate the impact of climate change.
Dr Singh pointed out that the introduction of centralised irrigation systems and large dams have led to serious soil erosion while the over-extraction of underground aquifers depleted the water table.
There was no more water to be drawn from under the ground, and the water at the top flowed away with the soil, causing erosion and silting, he said. All the small rivers are dying.
DEBT DESPERATION AND SUICIDE
Faced with the water crisis and their crop failures, desperate farmers have turned to money lenders for loans to buy food, seeds, fertiliser and equipment.
These money lenders charge exorbitant interest rates and as debts pile up, farmers often find themselves unable to cope with the pressure. Some think that by killing themselves, they can save their families - but money lenders dont stop hounding the survivors.
We still have debts that we havent been able to repay. None of our debts has been cancelled, said Madam Vijayakumari.
FOR NOW, A COMMUNITY SOLUTION
Dr Singh, also known as Indias Water Man, has been fighting an uphill battle to revive water bodies and rivers in the semi-arid region of Rajasthan for more than 30 years. He has set up more than 8,000 water tanks and revived seven rivers in Rajasthan.
In Alwar district, about 200 km from Delhi, he has used path-breaking water conservation techniques to bring water back to more than 1,000 villages. He believes local water preservation and community-driven water management systems are the only ways to end the terrible disaster.
Dr Sunita Narain, Director General of the India-based research institute - the Centre for Science and Environment, believes that Tamil Nadu needs to augment its water supply through a decentralised water harvesting system.
This means building water tanks and going back to the traditions of harvesting water, restoring and recharging every lake and pond in Tamil Nadu. She also thinks that the state needs to move away from water intensive crops such as sugar cane.
Third, make every industry and city in Tamil Nadu water-wise, so you use less water and you recharge and recharge every drop of water the Singapore way. It has to be a combination of all three, she said.

Entrepreneur-development workshop
There is a tremendous demand for ayurvedic products in the World Market today and we should grab that opportunity, without letting it go. Steps should be taken export ayurvedic products in bulk to attract the international buyers, said Primary Industries Minister Daya Gamage.
He said so at an entrepreneur-development workshop held at the Ministry premises on August 3rd. The participants at the workshop included undergraduates following the indigenous medicine university course at the Colombo University and those who follow the same course at the Wickramarchchi Ayurvedic Institute in Gampaha.
The workshop was conducted with the participation of the Primary Industries Ministry Secretary Bandula Wickremaarachchi, Prof. D.N. Weeerasinghe, Dr. Kumuduni Gunaseker and Senior Assistant Secretary to the Ministry Chathuri Nakandala.
Minister Gamage speaking further, informed the participants that there was US $ 120 billion market for ayurvedic products in the World Market and underscored the importance of increasing the qualitative ayurvedic products in the country. He invited the future Ayurvedic doctors to be conscious of this great demand the world is making and depending on our response, we would be in a position to earn much-needed foreign exchange.
Disclosing what plans his Ministry has, to coop-up with the world-wide great demand for ayurvedic product with quality, Minister Gamage said that soon, steps would be taken to create awareness among the polity, what benefits ayurvedic medicine contribute for healthy living and said he plans to have a specific area allocated in every village to give preference to grow plants with medicinal benefit to healthy living and his Ministry would readily provide all assistance necessary, to successfully move with the new venture.
It is rather unfortunate and our sad experience that practically all await to get government jobs. But there is great opportunity at hand and a healthy environment is there to come out and run a business of ones own. I encourage those keen to grab the opportunity to step into the business world without wasting time looking for State-jobs. The workshop ended with a discussion followed by the key note address.

Faith unmoved
The fountain of compassion, the supreme enlightened one blesses the humanity with the outcome of his intellectual struggle  the greatest truth that ever occurred in human history two months after his enlightenment on Esala full moon day he delivered his first sermon to the five ascetics in Deer Part at Isipathana Benares and set in motion the wheel of Dhamma. The priceless Dhamma was brought into focus. The gift Dhamma excels all other gifts Sabha Danam Dhamma Danam Jinathi, so said Sakyamuni Gautama the all wise, all compassionate universal teacher displaying the distinctive noble message. He advised him, numerous disciples, to spread the doctrine and the message of the Dhamma to all mankind in the whole world. When the monsoon breaks, however, it was not possible for them to engage in the samsaric tour.
Vassana
The Sakyamuni Gautama advised them to stay indoors this period is called vas meaning rain. Esala poya marks the beginning of the vas season when Bhikkhus had been advised to stay in their own temples without going for alms. It is said that the first vassana was observed by the Buddha and his five disciples at Isipatana Migadaye in Benares. This traditionally accepted vas retreat coming down from Buddha time is continued to date by the most revered Sangha with great piety and the Nikini Poya remains very important.
Vassana remains honoured for those devout Buddhists who await the dawn of if to engage in religious activities and gain merit. This is the time that the meritorious heart of the true Buddhist is best with love and compassion. This is the time that both clergies as well as the laity engage in Dana, Seela, Bhavana the three fold activities of true Buddhists while at the same time giving up Loba, Dwesha and Moha.
Profound faith
They invite the Maha Sangha to observe Vas with Vas Aradhana Pinkama since that time, till it culminates in Katina pooja and the laity look after them to the best of their ability. It is the responsibility of the Dayaka Sabha to look after the Sangha attending to all their needs complying with their requests. They see to the comfort of the sangha with great care making offerings and paying them respect in every way. The devotees visit the temple daily for religious activities such as Mal Pooja and Bodhi pooja in the evening and listen to the sermons delivered by the sangha. They engage in acts of guiding Upasaka Upasikas in Dhamma path helping them in religious rituals and the true Buddhists, in turn, provide the Bhikkhus with four essentials in the life of a Bhikkhu namely, Cheevara Pindapatha Senasana Gilanaprathya (robes alms, shelter and medical case), the most merit bestowing religious act of theirs. The practice of observing vassana continues to this day as the fulfilment of a disciplinary requirement as laid down by the Buddha. Hence vassana creates a special religious awakening among the Buddhists making a great impact on their moral lives.
Sangayana
Among the other events, the most historic and the most sacred event was the first convention or the first Dhamma Sangayana to preserve the supreme gift of Dhamma in its pristine purity in the land of its birth  Jambudweepa. This was undertaken by his third disciple Arahat Maha Kashyapa which was held at Saptapanni cave entrance located in the foot hills of Himalaya. Ven. Ananda supposed to be the treasurer of Dhamma, the very person who should have been leading the event was unable to participate due to his failure to attain Arahantship. However, with a determined effort, it was achieved on the Nikini Fullmoon day, paving the way for his to make the most intellectual contribution to the Sangayana. It was a landmark gift to the upkeep of the Buddha Sasana.

Gatlin stuns Bolt to win 100m world title
LONDON, Saturday - Justin Gatlin ruined Usain Bolt's farewell party when the 35-year-old American won the world 100 metres title on Saturday, beating the Jamaican superstar into third and sparking a chorus of boos from a London crowd unhappy with his doping past.
What was meant to be a glorious celebration of the departure of the sport's greatest showman turned into a condemnation of its biggest pantomime villain as Gatlin, twice banned for drug offences, rolled back the years to win a second world title 12 years after his first and 13 after claiming Olympic 100m gold.
As so often before Bolt made a terrible start but for once could not make it up as Christian Coleman, the 21-year-old American who beat him in the semi-finals, looked set for victory.
But Gatlin, who stumbled at the death to lose the 2015 world final to Bolt by a hundredth of a second, on this occasion timed his surge and dip to perfection to win in 9.92 seconds.
Coleman, who has run over 40 races this year but turned professional only a few weeks ago, took silver in 9.94.
Bolt, straining every sinew, fought all the way to the line but the pace and grace that took him to his world record of 9.58 eight years ago has withered with age and perennial injury battles and this time he ran out of track.
It's just one of those things, Bolt said. My start is killing me. Normally, it gets better during the rounds but it didn't come together.
When the results flashed up on the giant screen the crowd immediately began repeating the booing with which Gatlin's name had been greeted since the heats on Friday.
Perhaps unsurprisingly, his first response was to put his finger to his lips to indicate silence.
The crowd reacted by chanting Bolt's name and the Jamaican hugged Gatlin and told him he did not deserve the disrespect.
I tuned it out (the boos) through the rounds and stayed the course. I did what I had to do, said Gatlin, who served a four-year ban from 2006 for a second doping offence - which he always denied.
The people who love me are here cheering for me and cheering at home.
It is Bolt's last race and he's the man so it's not about beating him. I have had many victories and many defeats down the years, he's pushed and inspired me to be the athlete I am today.
It's surreal really to come across the line first - it's still his night.
We are rivals on the track but in the warm-down area we joke and have a good time. The first thing he did was congratulate me and say that I didn't deserve the boos. He is an inspiration.
FIRST BRONZE
As always, the ever-popular Bolt gave generously of his time after the race to fans and media alike, despite the unfamiliarity of finishing third for the first time in a major championship.
The Jamaican had been seeking a fourth 100m world title to go with his four over 200m, four relay golds and eight Olympic crowns and a capacity 56,000 crowd had turned out fully expecting to celebrate it.
I needed to be in a better place after 30 metres but I just wasn't in that super-shape I needed to be in, said Bolt, who turns 31 this month.
I gave it my best shot but my body's telling me it's time to go.
He still has another chance to add to the medal tally in the 4x100m relay next week - when he will be desperate to avenge Saturday's defeat in what, if the Americans manage to get the baton round, should be a last-leg showdown with Gatlin.
Also in the U.S. team will be Coleman, who looked set for a remarkable victory running in the lane alongside Bolt until the man 14 years his senior snatched it from lane eight of nine.
Coleman, however, was not about to complain.
Both of us have done well, I'm really happy for him to get the gold and I'm delighted with silver, he said.
Of Bolt, he added: He's a man who has taken the sport to a whole new level.
He's been an icon of mine as I've grown up. It's an honour to toe the line with him. - Agencies

India wraps up second Test and series
Sri Lanka recovered from their disastrous first innings debacle to put up a heroic batting display in the second innings but couldnt prevent India from winning the second Test by an innings and 53 runs at the SSC grounds yesterday and taking an unassailable 2-0 lead in the three-match series. It was Indias first victory by an innings in Sri Lanka.
The win was Indias eighth consecutive Test series victory under the captaincy of Virat Kohli since he took over the reins from MS Dhoni in 2015 and it confirmed Indias status as the number ranked Test team in the world.
For a larger part of the fourth day it seemed with Dimuth Karunaratne firmly anchoring the innings from one end and playing so resolutely that Sri Lanka would be able to stretch India into the fifth day by avoiding an innings defeat.
Sri Lanka who resumed yesterday at 209-2 went to lunch at 302-4 with Karunaratne having carried his overnight score from 92 to 136 completing his sixth Test hundred (fourth in the second innings) off 224 balls with 13 fours and, former captain Angelo Mathews unbeaten on 28.
Karunaratne who was dismissed for 97 in the first Test at Galle nearly bungled it this time again when at 95 he was put down by Lokesh Rahul at forward short leg off Ravindra Jadeja who was getting more bite and turn with his left-arm deliveries than his spin partner Ravichandran Ashwin.
Having rode his luck Karunaratne continued to thwart the Indian bowling thus raising Sri Lankan hopes although it was a tall order to save the Test.
However in the first session after lunch all hopes of saving the Test vanished as Jadeja sent back Karunaratne, Mathews and Dilruwan Perera off successive overs with ripping deliveries to ensure another four-day finish to the Test as Sri Lanka slipped from a promising 302-4 to 321-7 in 51 balls and were finally all out for 386 on the stroke of tea.
It was not so much the ball bowled by Jadeja that resulted in Karunaratnes dismissal after a marathon 377-minute stint but the state of the pitch that saw the ball pitch and rip through to take his glove and land safely in the hands of the fielder at slip.
It was an unkind end to an innings of great quality and how much the opposition admired that knock can be gauged by the fact that most of Indias close-in fielders ran over to shake his hand including his partner Mathews at the other end.
Karunaratne who was dismissed for 141 has two of the three-highest scores by a Sri Lankan batsman while following-on. He scored 152 against New Zealand at Christchurch in 2014 and the other innings was from the present Sri Lanka cricket manager and selector Asanka Gurusinha who scored 143 against Australia at Melbourne in 1995.
With five wickets in the innings  his ninth overall and first against Sri Lanka and an unbeaten 70 Jadeja won the Man of the Match award.
Sri Lanka may have lost the Test but they can take a lot of heart from the resolute batting of Karunaratne and the exciting knock by Kusal Mendis on a turning pitch. Niroshan Dickwella and Rangana Herath with a series of sweeps and reverse-sweeps only delayed the inevitable before Pandya and Ashwin completed the win. The third and final Test commences at Pallekele on August 12.

Initial stages of the First Dhamma Council : Tradition kept alive
Immediately after the Buddhas death, a monk named Subaddha cried out that they dont need to worry about discipline anymore. This Subaddha should not be misunderstood with the other monk who was ordained at the old age.
This was clear indication that there was some unrest in the monk order. The monk order had the royal patronage and received the warm welcome whenever they went on alms. Like today some people must have entered the monkhood for the sake of benefits and perks. The monks in the urbanity lived a luxurious life.
This luxurious life was much criticized among other sects of religion. Emperor Asokas brother Veethashoka was an ardent follower of Jainism and did not have a good opinion about the Buddhas disciples. He always cited that the Buddhist monks had all royal luxuries.
This fell on emperors ears too. Asoka had a plan for his brother. While Veethasoka was dallying with his mates, the minister approached him and said that it's time he should practice the kingship. Veethasoka was not interested. But the minister insisted that as the brother of the Emperor he should be ready to take over in any case of emergency.
Veethasoka was forced to sit on the throne. Thats when the emperor approached and saw his brother on the throne. This led him to rage and ordered execution immediately. Veethasoka was helpless, and within a few moments, the Emperor said he would lessen the punishment.
He will be given seven days of kingship before the execution. During the period, he will be getting every benefit an emperor is entitled to. Veethasoka, though he had every power and things, was not happy even for a single moment within his seven days. Upon the completion, Asoka asked his brother if he enjoyed the royal perks. Veethasoka said he didnt enjoy it even a single moment, for the fear of death. Asoka then said there was no plan to behead him, but that was carried out to show that though monks live in royal luxuries they constantly have the fear of death. Thats no comfort then, the Emperor said.
The discipline of Buddhism has been such. The Buddha always encouraged the middle path, though this itself is difficult to understand. This kind of discipline did not appeal to some monks who ordained for benefits. The Buddha instructed that his teachings will be the teacher following his death.
The Buddhas teachings
The only way to preserve the Buddhism was to protect the teacher - the teachings, in this case. But teachings were not arranged into one place. The Buddha had taught on many occasions. That teaching had to be assembled. This is how first Dhamma convention starts.
Monk Ananda was only Sotapanna when the Buddha passed away. That became an issue when the first Dhamma convocation was to be held; it comprised only of arahants. When the scripts state monk Ananda became an arahant just the night before the convocation, it seems a little unbelievable. But it can be so since the monk has already entered the path.
Even before the lapse of three months, the Buddhas teachings faced the threat of being shattered. Many attempted to infiltrate and misinterpret the teachings. The first Dhamma convocation had to come to pass on Nikini Poya, thought Arahant Maha Kassapa.
Subaddhas remark was the immediate thing that signalled a disaster  something really to mourn over. Many non-arahants including Ananda genuinely lamented.
The need for a convocation was imminent because the teachings were facing threats even during the Buddhas life. His cousin Devadatta caused ripples by trying to introduce new amendments.
Arahant Maha Kassapa spent most of his life in the forest, mainly because he did not want to be mistaken as the Buddha: they had similar physical features except that the Buddha was four inches taller. Apparently, as an arahant, he did not mourn the passing away but was concerned about arrangements. He had to shoulder many responsibilities as he was the third chief disciple of the Buddha: the two chief disciples, Sariputta and Moggallana, had passed away before the Buddha. The convocation was his brainchild.
He must have been sure about monk Anandas capacity of achieving the arahantship, when he handpicked only 499 arahants for the convocation. The event occurred in the city of Rajagaha in Magadha state.
Monk Ananda
Monk Anandas role was significant not merely because he was the Buddhas chief attendant, but he had a powerful memory of the teachings. In addition, he enjoyed good intelligence and common sense.
The Buddha praised him when he delivered a sermon to King Mahanama eloquently. As the chief attendant, his service was unsurpassable. He nearly sacrificed his life to elephant Nalagiri, who came to attack the Buddha under the Dutch courage. This must have been sole reason  that he led an extremely busy life - monk Ananda could not concentrate on further mental developments.
He was struck by emotions when he heard the Buddha was about to pass away. He leaned against a column and wept silently. Consoling his chief attendant, the Buddha prophesied Ananda had done enough merits to become an arahant.
The convocation lasted three months. The Dhamma was classified into Sutta and Vinaya. The Sutta section contains Nikayas: Digha (lengthy), Majjhima (middle), Samyuktha (compact), Anguttara (sections) and Khuddaka (small).
Monks learnt them by heart, and they were known as bhanaka. Monks were divided according to the relevant section of the Dhamma.
Arahant Ananda and followers  Digha Nikaya
Arahant Sariputtas followers  Majjhima Nikaya
Arahant Ananda and his followers were entrusted with the responsibility for Digha Nikaya. The followers of Arahant Sariputta were entrusted with Majjhima Nikaya. Samyutta Nikaya was entrusted to Arahant Maha Kassapa and his followers. Anguttara Nikaya was the responsibility of Arahant Anuruddha and his followers. All the arahants, in general, were made responsible for the Khuddaka Nikaya. Vinaya Pitaka was entrusted to Arahant Upali Thera.
This convocation was known as Pancha Sathika Sangikthi as it was held with the participation of 500 monks who had attained arahantship.

Kalumnai, Sammanthurai to be developed as ultra modern city
Kalmunai and Sammanthurai will be an extensive modern city with state-of-the-art infrastructure facilities once the master plan for the project is realized, City Planning and Water Supply Minister and Sri Lanka Muslim Congress Leader Rauff Hakeem said.
He was chairing a meeting to review the progress of the project held at the ministry .
Minister Hakeem said he believed that the major city under development would turn out to be a ultra-modern commercial hub with huge foreign and local investments and population about 500,000 by 2050. Initiatives will be taken to link the commercial hubs of Hambantota and Trincomalee, he said.
Prof. P.K.S.Mahanama, University of Moratuwa explained at the meeting the main features of the proposed city development project.
The project, on completion, will resemble major modern cities in Dubai and Bahrain, he explained. An official said generating power from solid waste and creating a solid-waste-free-environment would be explored.
Experts are designing a system to handle flood situations and to develop all water bodies and reservoirs, the official said. Deputy Minister H.M.M.

Keys shocks Muguruza to reach Stanford final
LOS ANGELES, Sunday  Madison Keys roared past top-seeded Wimbledon champion Garbine Muguruza 6-3, 6-2 on Saturday to book an all-American WTA Stanford final against CoCo Vandeweghe.
Keys, the third seed, needed just 57 minutes to subdue Muguruza, who claimed the second Grand Slam title of her career when she beat Venus Williams in the final at Wimbledon.
Keys ended Muguruza's nine-match winning streak, and reached her first final of 2017.
She'll face fellow American CoCo Vandeweghe, who reached the final with a 6-3, 6-1 victory over CiCi Bellis.
Although she was broken early in each set, Keys showed plenty of resolve in breaking back both times. She gained the decisive break in the opening set for a 5-3 lead and served out the set.
She then broke Muguruza as they opened the second set with three straight service breaks, and when Keys then held she had a 3-1 lead.
She broke Muguruza one more time to make it 4-1 when the Spaniard knocked a forehand into the net.
Firing on all cylinders on her own serve, Keys wouldn't face another break point, and finished off the match with a service winner.
I was really happy with how even though I got broken right off the bat in both sets I held it together and stayed composed, said Keys, who was sidelined at the start of the year by a wrist injury and has struggled to find consistency. - AFP

Kohli praises his spinners and Lankas high class batting
Indian captain Virat Kohli praised his spinners and the strategy employed by the Sri Lankan batsmen against them after his team had completed a comprehensive innings win in the second Test at the SSC grounds yesterday.
The bowlers did an outstanding job today of pulling things back and keeping it simple. And thats what happens in Test cricket, sessions go away from you and you have to pull it back to win a Test match. It was very good for us from a teams point of view, said Kohli.
We were up against a challenge in the last four sessions that we played yesterday (Saturday) and today. We managed to turn things around. You always feel good as a team when you come back from a difficult situation and win the Test match.
Then you have to give credit to the batsmen as well, to play like that on a pitch like that. It was high quality batting and you expect that to happen at Test level. We spoke as a team that we have to embrace this because all sessions that we play are not going to go our way.
Against the pace of (Ravindra) Jadeja, especially for the right-hander (Kusal Mendis) I think it was a high quality innings; not even one sweep was mistimed or misconnected or in the air. We have to give credit to the batters there. As a captain you can do only so much. The field was spread as well and still they were finding gaps and thats what momentum can do.
You have to keep things realistic and accept that these situations will also come again and again and its how we react as a team. Its all about improving ourselves as players in those situations and not getting too frustrated. We tried our best whatever we could but they were just too good yesterday for sure, he said.
Kohli said that due to the pitch getting slower and slower bowlers were finding it hard to beat the bat and find the edges which fell short of the fielders.
It was getting slower and thats why we took the new ball straight away. We thought with the harder new ball one might keep straight because the older ball was soft and all balls were turning so it was very difficult to get edges and create chances. As soon as the new ball was taken then we thought the batsmen are going to look to score now.
The ball might come better on to the bat and then they might play more shots. The bowlers are in the game as well when there is more pace because of the harder ball, said Kohli.
The pitch was such that the chances had to come at some stage. But credit to them to have done that, it requires a lot of ability and mental strength. I mean we were actually watching in awe yesterday (Saturday), the sweeping was outstanding and we congratulated both the batters because it was proper Test cricket batting and high quality temperament from both.
The Indian captain praised the all-round ability of man of the match Jadeja and said, Guys who have both abilities are very rare to find. Thats where we think theyre very precious, especially in the longer format because they provide you with great balance. He can give you a very quick 60-70 anywhere at any stage of the game and it can really turn the game.  ST

KTFL to launch new high-quality black tea variety
Kalubowitiyana Tea Factory Ltd (KTFL), a public company fully owned by the Government, will soon launch CTC BP 1, a high-quality and much-sought after variety of black tea, to the local market in an attractive package and at a concessionary price.
CTC BP 1 black tea pack
KTFL Chairman Pushpika Samarakoon said his company had decided to introduce BP 1 to the local market after Plantation Industries Minister Navin Dissanayake had instructed to introduce quality tea at an affordable price to the local market. He said CTC BP 1 was earlier produced mainly for exports, but added that this will be released at a very affordable price to the local market, heeding the instructions of the minister. He also said the CTC BP 1 will be a deviation from the dust tea varieties which are prevalent in the local market.
Samarakoon added that the BP 1 will be issued at a concessionary price to welfare shops managed by government and semi-government institutions as well. The CTC BP 1 variety Samarakoon said will be of good taste and flavor and people could make more tea cups out of the variety than the normal ones prevailing in the market. He also noted that KTFL tea was being produced with minimal agro-chemicals to ensure that products are healthy and toxin-free. Speaking about the progress of the KTFL, he said that all four factories under the company were earning profits. He said around 5,000 smallholders were currently providing tea leaves to the company. The Smallholders and their families, according to Samarakoon, are provided with many benefits, including insurance coverages, educational scholarships for children, concessionary loans etc.
According to Samarakoon, the company currently produces over 2,000,000 kgs of black tea annually and its products have a high demand in both foreign and local markets. KTFL contributes to 6.89 per cent of national CTC tea production and 30.23 percent of total low-grown CTC tea production to national output. Its output has been recognized and rewarded as the best quality low-grown CTC tea on several occasions. Kalubowitiyana Tea Factory Ltd (KTFL) was incorporated under the Companies Act on September 30, 1992 as a public company fully owned by the Government.
It began commercial operations at the then newly built CTC Tea Factory at Kalubowitiyana on August 1, 1994. This CTC Tea Factory was built with the assistance of the Indian Line of Credit.
The Company has been operating on a self-financing basis since 1995.

LAC celebrates 39 years
Recently, the LAC celebrated 39 years of service for the Nation. The LAC was established on July 7, 1978 by the Legal Aid Law No. 27 of 1978.
The vision of the LAC is to create a society where all deserving Sri Lankan citizens have equal access to Justice. The LAC was established to accomplish the mission of identifying members of our society who are marginalized and lack the means to access the remedial measures available under the law.
These categories of persons have been statutorily identified as deserving persons. Such flexibility in the statute wording has made it possible for the application of the mean test and the justice test and also offering representations in courts of law or other forums so that such deserving members in the society may secure justice.
The functions of the LAC
The main functions of the LAC are to provide Legal counseling free of charge and legal representation in court cases for the persons whose monthly income is below Rs. 25,000. According to the Section 04(II) of Stamp Duty (Amended) Act No. 71 of 1988 legal aid cases are exempted from stamp duty.
Legal Aid is available to all women seeking maintenance for themselves and for their children, irrespective of their income level. The LAC also conducts Legal Awareness for the different target groups in the country.
When providing legal aid, the LAC focuses on two tests. In the mean test, the LAC concerns the income level of the litigant. The litigants whose monthly income level is below Rs. 25,000 are capable of seeking free legal representation for their court cases. (The LAC considers the certification of the Grama Niladhari).
In the beginning, the LAC had only one centre, but within 39 years, it was able to increase the number of centres up to 81.
Legal Aid as a right
According to the Sri Lankan Constitution Article 12(1)  All persons are equal before the Law and entitled to equal protection of the Law. Article 13(3)  Any person charge with an offence shall be entitled to be heard in person or an Attorney-at-Law, at a fair trial by a competent Court. Therefore, the Legal Aid was established by Act No. 27 of 1978. As per the Supreme Court Rule No. 44(7), the Supreme Court can also refer the Fundamental Rights complains received by the chief justice to the Legal Aid Commission to file Fundamental Rights Cases.
LAC structure
The Legal Aid Commission consists of nine members. Three members are appointed by the Minister of justice and six by the Bar Council. Appointed members hold office for the period of three years and are eligible for reappointment. One member is appointed as the Chairman of the Legal Aid Commission. At present, the LAC Chairman is Rohan Sahabandu, Presidents Counsel. The late S.S. Wijeratne, who served as the Chairman from 2005 to 2013, was able to expand legal aid centres from 12 to 76. The retired Supreme Court Justice Hector S. Yapa serves as the Director General of the LAC at present. The LAC is the main legal aid provider which comes under the Ministry of Justice.
LAC litigation
The LAC provides free legal assistance to file maintenance matters, claims to compensation to accident cases, divorce/guardianship cases, Land/Eviction cases, money and other civil matters, Bail applications, Other MC Matters, enforcement of elders maintenance orders, safeguard the rights of victim of crime and etc. The LAC does not provide legal assistance for criminal matters testamentary and partition matters.
The LAC also appears in Labour Tribunals, Debt Conciliation Board, Rent Board of Review, Compensation Tribunal, and Administrative Appeals Tribunals on behalf of poor litigants.
Awareness-raising programme
The LAC conducts awareness programmes and clinics for the following target groups around the country:
Women and Children
Elders
Migrant Workers
Prisoners Rights
Differently-abled People
Consumers
Legal Apprentices
Para Legal Trainees
Projects for Indigenous People
People living with HIV
LGBTIQ
Government Officials
Police and security Officers
Drug Addicts and Their Family Members
School children and Scouts The LAC also have special desks for each target group to resolve their legal issues, file cases and provide free legal counseling. The LAC conducts special awareness-raising programmes and stakeholder meetings to resolve their problems of above mentioned groups.
Awareness via media and publications
The LAC has published a number of booklets and pamphlets on various legal aspects to raise awareness among general public. And there are media programmes on television, radio and news papers.The Legal Aid Commission has rendered its services Island wide for the past 39 years as a unique organization to make the concept of equal access justice is a reality. The legal Officers, Panel Lawyers and the staff attached to the legal Aid Commission are the contributors of this continuous legal aid journey.

Language equality : A road to reconciliation
Last May, Uadaya Sivakumar and her husband got into a car accident in Colombo. It wasnt serious, but they knew immediately that they were in for an ordeal.
They are both Tamil. Sivakumar grew up in Kandy, before moving to Colombo when she was young and her husband is from Jaffna. After the crash, they went to the local Police station to submit a report.
When they arrived, the receiving officer only spoke in Sinhala, Sivakumar recalled in an interview. She speaks Sinhala, as well as Tamil and English, but her husband can only speak basic Sinhala, she said.
I told the Police officer that my husband can't speak Sinhala, so to let me talk instead and he replied, 'No he has to talk; its an accident, so he has to explain,' she said. The Police officer was rude. Extremely rude.
Sivakumar said that because of the language barrier, it took almost four hours to record the complaint.
Sivakumar and many other Sri Lankan Tamils like her, say occurrences like this are a routine part of daily life. Reminders that the government of the Sinhala-majority country does not operate in the minoritys mother tongue are everywhere, in the form of misspelled road signs, bank forms, bus routes and hospital records.
Official language
The result of all this is that Tamils often do not have equal access to government services as their Sinhala neighbors, even though legally, Tamil has been an 'official language' of the country since parliament passed the 13th Amendment of the Constitution in 1987.
Sivakumar said that even though she was born here, went to school here, works here and has family here, she often feels like an immigrant to her own country. I always have that feeling, she said.
She is not alone. Data collected by the Consultation Task Force on Reconciliation Mechanisms, a group set up by the Prime Minister in 2016, shows deep distrust in the governments ability to communicate with its Tamil citizens.
In most of the 7,300 submissions the task force received, people identified shortcomings in bi-lingual language proficiency throughout the machinery of the State as a major impediment to reconciliation, its final report stated.
They recommended that bi-lingual training for government workers be prioritized immediately.
However, the Government has largely ignored this recommendation, in the words of the International Crisis Group, an international NGO.
It has now been three decades since Tamil became an official language in Sri Lanka. But interviews with residents, government officials, and NGO leaders show that progress towards the Governments stated goal of language equality is extremely slow.
Some argue its practically nonexistent.
Lost in translation
Mano Ganesan, the Minister of National Coexistence Dialogue and Official Languages, said theres a reason for this slow progress in a recent interview.
We had a war. We had various other priorities, he said. Even the violators, or the people who underwent violations, had no idea; no urge to demand the legal status (of Tamil).
But the consequences of inaction have continued to breed the kind of conditions that led to civil war in the first place.
Luise von Flotow, a Canadian academic who was in Sri Lanka in 2013 and 2014 as part of the National Languages Project, said she was struck by the language barriers here between the government and its citizens, particularly in the Tamil-majority North.
She recalled a Tamil and English-speaking judge she met in Jaffna, who had to deal with cases that Sinhala-speaking police brought to court.
All documents were in Sinhala, and had not been translated due to lack of translators,she said. The only trilingual person to work with the judge was the Court registrar.
With the accused often only speaking Tamil, many cases descended into confusion.
True reconciliation
On the internet, Tamils often share pictures of misspelled road signs and signboards. Recent examples include the main sign for the Central Banks regional office in Kilinochchi, and the entrance of the Galle National Museum. They were spelled correctly in Sinhala and English, but were not, in Tamil.
Uadaya Sivakumar said she often has to change her name on government forms, as even paperwork translated into Tamil requires people put down a middle name. Middle names are extremely rare in Tamil culture.
To get around it, she writes her name as Udayaa Siva Kumar, she said.
This carelessness with language is hurting the one particular ethnic group, said V. Janagan, the CEO of IDM Nations Campus and an advocate for Tamil language rights. So when I see my language used in a very wrong way, it hurts.
Janagan said he believes the only way to heal the divide, and create lasting peace in Sri Lanka, is to commit to real instruction of Tamil and Sinhala in all primary schools.
Currently, mandates do exist to teach both languages in government schools, but the lack of qualified Tamil teachers in the South, and Sinhala teachers in the North, hobbles progress.
If people became fluent in each others languages, all the problems will simply vanish, Janagan said. All the pain will still be there, of course we lost so many people but all the pain, one day, will go out from our memories.
Sinrasa Thananchayan, a law student at the University of Jaffna, said he believes language is perhaps the main barrier to post-war reconciliation.
We need to communicate with the government, with the southern people. Only by way of this communication can we actually achieve the true reconciliation of peace, he said.
One of the reasons for the emergence of the LTTE and other Tamil armed groups on the northern side, one of the reasons was miscommunication, he added.
Political window
Some analysts say the necessary legal framework for language equality in Sri Lanka already exists. The problem is the lack of commitment by those in power to enforce it.
The political will to be able to prioritize this, and having prioritized this allocate the requisite resources its not there, Centre for Policy Alternatives Executive Director Dr. Paikiasothy Saravanamuttu said in an interview.
Even with the election of a unity government in 2015, commitment to true post-war accountability does not exist, he said.
That has to be broken by a concerted political effort, by the two main parties who currently are in government to come out and do a campaign on the basis of reconciliation and national unity in which language is basic pillar and integral part, he added.
He said he believes that the current government coalition has a unique opportunity to enact deep structural change to the state that would create grounds for a lasting peace.
I think there is still room for reform, but what it requires is a major concerted effort to pry it open, and let the air in, he said.
For the official language policy to actually be implemented, resources need to flow on the ground. If there were enough translators in government agencies, or multi-lingual government workers, things like what happened to Uadaya Sivakumar at the Colombo police station wouldnt happen anymore.
If the language policy was properly implemented, you would go somewhere, Dr Saravanamuttu said.
It would begin ensuring that non-Sinhala speaking citizens of this country feel that the state also belongs to them, and begin to have a vested interest in the state of the country.
Room for hope
For people like Janagan, the CEO and activist, Dr. Saravanamuttu, the head of the think tank and Minister Ganesan, there is still hope in a political solution to the language issue.
Ganesan said his ministry is planning on employing 3,200 new language officials, who are bi or tri-lingual, in government offices all over the island by next year.
He said they are also working on developing better translation software between Sinhala, Tamil, and English, and a mobile translation app.
Every citizen has the right to get a response, written or oral, in the language of their choice, anywhere in the country, he said. But that has a long way to go.
But for Thananchayan, the young law student from Jaffna, and many in the younger generation, the solution to the language barrier may lie outside of government initiatives.
He said people are finding new ways to communicateover Facebook and other forms of social media.
Nowadays the trend is, especially in regard to this social media, the people themselves, without trusting, without seeking assistance from the government, or even their representatives, they come to the road, and they protest, and they do everything, he said.
Young people communicate in way older people cant, he said. Because of that, he added, there is hope.

Lay the foundation for sacred heights
The Lankaramaya dagoba with over two millennia history was built with the Buddhas relics enshrined. It is one of the eight sacred sites of Anuradhapura revered by the Buddhists across the country.
Located to the Southwest of Abayagiri dagoba the Lankaramaya was constructed by King Valagamba, a nephew of King Dutugemunu during the 1st century BC.
The Dagoba was reduced to ruins as a result of the constant invasions. The devotees to the Dagoba, however, have increased in numbers. All the same, the temple does not have a proper shrine room.
The Lankaramaya Chief Incumbent Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said that the construction of a shrine room has commenced. The enshrined relics include a part of the Buddhas belt and the Queen Somas jewellery (which was offered to the Buddhist Order later).
According to Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera, King Valagamaba was the fourth son of King Saddhatissa, the brother of King Dutugemunu. King Valagambas three elder brothers: Thulatthana, Lanja Tissa and Khallata Naga ruled the country before him.
The Venerable Thera added that Maharattaka, a General of King Khallata Naga, killed the latter and usurped the power.
Then the prince Valagamba killed the general in turn and took the throne himself, elaborated Venerable Dhammajothi Thera. Then he brought up the son of his assassinated brother as his own son and made Anuladevi the Queen of Khallata Naga his queen too. He had another queen. She was Somadevi.
One should not yet mistake this Somavathi queen of Polonnaruwa for her namesake in Anuradhapura. The Somawathi Dagoba was constructed on the instructions of Queen Somawathi of Polonnaruwa.
A few months following King Valagambas coronation, a Brahmin named Thissa in Rohana rebelled against the king. In the meanwhile, Cholas from South India, led by seven leaders, also landed in the country. They demanded power from the king. Ven Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera said there had been a shrine room during the royal times.
However now there is no shrine room. We have already laid the foundation for the construction of a shrine room above 2500 square feet. We have set up a Committee to make this project a reality with the assistance of a pious group of devotees from Gampaha area led by a lady teacher, added Venerable Relapanawe Dhammajothi Thera.
The construction of a shrine room is one the eight most efficacious merits that a devotee can execute.
As the President of the Anuradhapura Lankarama Temple Shrine Room Fund, Venerable Dhammajothi Thera said that the construction cost of one square foot of the shrine room is around Rs 7000 including for the interior decorations and those who wish to make their contributions either could contact 0252221884 or 0777855399, or email at [emailprotected]. The contributions could be made to a bank account in Anuradhapura.

More arrests imminent in Navy youth abductions case
Evidence developed following the arrest of Navy Commodore D.K.P.Dassanayake has lead investigators to identify at least three more navy personnel suspected of involvement in the abduction and disappearance of 11 youths between 20082009, informed Police sources said.
Dassanayake and five seamen were arrested in July and produced before Colombo Fort Magistrate Lanka Jayaratne on July 10 in connection with the abduction and later disappearance of the eleven youths.
The arrests followed a lengthy investigation in which CID detectives interviewed the families of the victims and over two dozen naval officers, and examined the navy facility in Trincomalee where the abducted youth are said to have been held.
Navy personnel who had feared cooperating with the investigators due to a belief that Dassanayake was too politically powerful within the higher echelons of the navy and in media circles came forward shortly after the arrests to provide the CID with valuable leads that are now being further developed by an elite investigative unit within the CID.
The new evidence is expected to allow the CID to demonstrate the nexus between the officers who ordered the abductions, others who carried out the orders and the individuals suspected of having made the ransom payments. While the report from the special team is pending, the main CID team are reportedly focusing their efforts on locating the bodies of the eleven victims.
Meanwhile, Attorney Asith Siriwardena appearing for the suspects on Wednesday informed court that he had personally been informed by law officers of the Attorney Generals Department that the CID had not presented any B Reports to the Attorney Generals department prior to making these arrests. The surprising submission prompted Magistrate Jayaratne to ask Siriwardena whether he was saying this with authority, and the defence lawyer responded in the affirmative.
The attorney appearing for the families of the victims then interrupted the exchange to state that the Attorney Generals Department is supposed to be representing the police and not the suspects, adding that if the state law officers believed that the CID had not followed due process, they would inform court themselves and not pass a message to court through the lawyer appearing for the suspects.

Navys proud moment
The Sri Lanka Navy (SLN) entered a new era last week with the commissioning of the first of two Indian-built Advanced Offshore Patrol Vessels (AOPVs) by Commander-in-Chief President Maithripala Sirisena in the presence of Navy Commander Vice Admiral Ravindra Wijegunaratne. This event signals SLNs entry to the elite club of deepwater navies.
Named SLNS Sayurala (Pennant Number P623), the 105.7 m long vessel is the largest ship to be operated by the SLN. It was handed over to the SLN on July 22 by Indias Goa Shipyard Limited. The second vessel (P624) is expected to be named SLNS Sindurala once it enters service in 2018.
The vessels have a top speed of 24 Knots, feature a full-load displacement of 2,350 tonnes, an overall beam of 13.6 m, and a hull draught of 3.6 m, according to Janes Fighting Ships. The new ship has a travel range of 7,000 nautical miles and has a landing facility and hangar for an Advanced Light Helicopter. The new vessel can accommodate a crew of 18 officers and 100 sailors. The vessel is powered by two MTU 20V 8000 M71 diesel engines driving two controllable-pitch propellers.
The Sri Lanka Navy played a major role in the military defeat of the LTTE and hundreds of sailors made the Supreme Sacrifice in defence of the Nation. The Navy aborted many Sea Tiger attacks aimed at crippling the Security Forces naval capability. We must not forget the Navys role in logistical support, troop transport and casualty evacuation in the theatre of war. Despite certain limitations of vessels available at the time, the Navy successfully engaged several LTTE vessels in the deep sea, which marked a turning point in the war against terror. The Navy successfully ventured into Asymmetrical Naval Warfare with amphibious landings and land-based operations. The heroic exploits of its Special Boat Squadron (SBS) are already legendary.
We are no longer a nation at war, but this does not mean that the Navy can lower its guard even for a moment. As one threat has receded, others have taken its place. Terrorism has taken on a global dimension, with other challenges such as human smuggling, human trafficking, narcotics and gun running and sea piracy becoming more prevalent. Hence the Navys newest vessel will see plenty of action on the high seas. Sri Lanka does have a nascent Coastguard spun off from the Navy itself, but the Navy which has better and bigger resources will still keep defending our International Maritime Boundary Line and other sea borders.
The SLNS Sayurala is thus expected to conduct patrols, policing, reconnaissance, surveillance, search and rescue, Humanitarian Assistance and Disaster Relief (HADR) and pollution control missions in Sri Lankas territorial waters. It can also be used for external fire-fighting missions. The Navy will seek and receive the support of the Army and the Air Force should the need arise in any situation. The Navy even had to engage in an unusual mission recently to rescue three elephants washed out to sea.
The Navy has also been able to earn millions of dollars for the State by again conducting anti-piracy sea patrols which were given over to a private company by the previous regime. The new vessels will hopefully play a bigger role in operations like these. The Navy is also partly responsible for the security of commercial ports around the island, along with the Sri Lanka Ports Authority. This role came under the spotlight recently when the Government reassured that in spite of the agreement with a Chinese company for operations at the Hambantota Port, the Navy will completely be in charge of security at the Port with no foreign military activity allowed.
The Navy also deserves praise for the ingenuity of its engineers who have not only made improvements to its vessels and operating systems, but also produced useful inventions in other spheres. The Navy has produced Infusion systems vital for Thalassemia patients for the removal of excessive iron deposits gathered in vital organs due to frequent blood transfusions. The equipment which costs around Rs. 80,000 to Rs. 150,000 in the open market is produced by the Navy at a cost of just Rs. 5,500. It is also active in what the private sector calls Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR). The Navys public welfare initiative in installing Reverse Osmosis (RO) water treatment plants in areas prone to kidney disease has provided easy access to safe drinking water to over 115,925 families and 81,316 schoolchildren. So far the Navy has produced and installed 242 RO plants across the island since December 2015.
The roots of the Navy, which celebrates its 67th anniversary as a Regular Force in December this year, actually go back 80 years to 1937, when the Ceylon Naval Volunteer Force was established. With an eye on the next 80 years, the Navys operational and manpower capabilities should be strengthened to meet current and future threats to our maritime borders. The welcome addition of several large vessels to the Navy will no doubt help it immensely to fulfill this avowed mission.

NCM against Ravi possible due to Govts stance on good governance: Kabir
Enterprise Development Minister and UNP General Secretary Kabir Hashim referring to the No-Confidence Motion against Foreign Minister Ravi Karunanayake tabled in Parliament said the most important thing here was the governments stand in favour of good governance.
If such a thing had happened during the past regime, there would not have been an opportunity to implement the law against a State Minister. Today, the supremacy of the law had been established in the country. Courts have been given the full authority to exercise the law of the land to the letter, Hashim said.
The government always stood for accountability and transparency. This stand would never change. As such they would decide on the steps they would take politically on this issue within the next few days, he said.
Minister Kabir Hashim stated this responding to a question raised by the media on the No Confidence Motion against Ravi Karunanayake when he attended a function held at Venus grounds Mawanella on August 6.
Minister Hashim further said the government would soon take a suitable decision about this No-Confidence Motion.
Currently discussions were being held among party leaders in the government regarding it and a final decision is imminent in the next few days.
Minister Hashim said when fraud and corruption allegations were brought against former ministers in opposition ranks they tried to label it as political victimisation.
They tried to give a wrong message to the people by trying to label it as part of a political agenda of the government.
But, since it was a duty of a person to show cause if there were any allegations against him or her the government had given its members the opportunity to perform that responsibility.

New Code of Conduct, revised set of Standing Orders for MPs
Parliament is to adopt a new Code of Conduct for MPs and revised set of Standing Orders shortly making it obligatory for all Parliamentarians to disclose information on their business relationships and financial interests including those of close family members.
Assistant Secretary-General of Parliament Kushani Rohanadeera told the Daily News yesterday that the final draft of Code of Conduct for MPs would be presented in Parliament this week.
The revised set of Standing Orders is also expected in the House within this month. Final touch-ups are being made to the two final drafts. These last minutes Amendments came up during a series of discussions held late last month. The provision for maintaining a Members Interests Register has been retained in the final draft, she said.
All parties including the Joint Opposition have consented for the declaration of interests of MPs. This provision has been made to increase the public trust in MPs, she added.
As per the draft Code of Conduct, every Member should immediately after a general election disclose to Parliament all relevant interests that a reasonable person might think could give rise to the perception of influencing behavior between duties and responsibilities and the personal interests of such Member such as assets relating to land and property, shareholdings and gifts.
Any items received or donated by an MP are also required to be disclosed under this provision. The provision also applies to the parents, spouse and children of the Member concerned. The proposed Code of Conduct also prevents any member from voting in a division on a question relating to a matter other than public policy in which he has a financial interest,Rohanadeera said.
Assistant Secretary-General of Parliament Tikiri Jayathilake, however, pointed out as the Code of Conduct for MPs is not a law such as the Assets and Liabilities Act, only disciplinary action could be taken at an instance of any incorrect or false information given to the register.
The register will be available for inspection by any member on request made to the Secretary-General. The provisions of the Right to Information Act No.12 of 2016 apply to publication of any information contained in the Register.

New Court of Appeal Judges welcomed
Attorney-General Jayantha Jayasuriya, P.C.,at the ceremonial sitting to welcome Justices Gamini Rohan Amarasekera, Anthony Lalith Shiran Gooneratne and Janak De Silva as judges of the Court of Appeal, said:
My Lord the President of the Court of Appeal, Your Ladyship and Lordships of the Court of Appeal and Members of the Judiciary;
We are gathered this morning to welcome three new Justices who were sworn in before the President, as Judges of the Court of Appeal. When we look into the individual careers of Your Lordships, we see three gentlemen who have come along three different paths, joining together, bringing in a blend of competency and skills, enhancing and enriching the overall quality and value of the second highest Court exercising appellate jurisdiction in our country.
My Lords, nearly three decades of judicial service in different capacities starting from a Magistrate, a District Judge and a High Court Judge has provided a strong foundation for Your Lordship Justice Gamini Rohan Amarasekera to build his career as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. Your Lordships tenures as a Judge of the Civil Appellate High Court and as a Judge of the Commercial High Court would no doubt have further strengthened Your Lordships ability to meet all challenges that may arise when dispensing justice. Your Lordships academic excellence is well-demonstrated by successfully completing Preliminary and Intermediate years at the Sri Lanka Law College, successfully completing those examinations with Honours.
Your Lordships quest for academic excellence is further demonstrated by the successful completion of his Bachelor of Laws Degree at the University of Colombo. Your Lordships academic achievements go beyond oceans. Your Lordships competency was well-recognized by the University of Aberdeen when they awarded Your Lordship the Master of Law in Commercial Law Degree with Commendation. We have no doubt that the commitment and efficiency Your Lordship demonstrated as a Judge will continue to brighten up Your Lordships career as a Judge of Court of Appeal.
A 17-year span in the Attorney-Generals Department followed by a 10-year span holding judicial office would be of immense help to meet all challenges when dispensing justice, as a Judge of the Court of Appeal. What Your Lordship brings in will further enrich the quality of justice delivered in the Court of Appeal.
International Relations as well as Commercial and Corporate Law are areas Your Lordship had ventured upon in with equal success. University of Colombo and Kings College, London recognized Your Lordships competency in those areas and decorated Your Lordships career by awarding Post Graduate Degrees such as Master of Arts and Master of Laws.
The experience Your Lordship acquired as a prosecutor as well as being involved in Consultative Committee for Radio and Television Broadcasting and Technical Project committee of the Coal Power Development Project at Norochcholai, mixed with experience Your Lordship acquired as a High Court Judge would facilitate a well balanced career as a Judge of the Court of Appeal.
Specialised skills Your Lordship developed as a trainee in Asser Institute in The Hague, Netherlands, Judicial and legal Training Institute, Malaysia and three judicial academies in India and experience accumulated during Your Lordships tenure as Senior State Counsel at Presidents Office in Republic of Seychelles will guide Your Lordships judicial career in its proper course.
It is said, The greatest healing therapy is friendship and love.
These words reflect thoughts of the 38th Vice President of the United States, Hubert Horatio Humphry Jr. In the year 1978, a Full-bright Exchange Programme was created in honour of the public service and career of this leading political figure.
This programme that is administered by the United States Department of State, provides ten months of non-degree academic study and related professional experiences in the United States. Humphrey Fellows are selected based on their potential for leadership and their commitment to public service.
Appointments of Your Lordships Justice Shiran Goonaratne and Justice Janak De Silva as judges of the Court of Appeal in the year 2017 stand in testimony on the accuracy of the judgment made by the administrators of this Exchange Programme several years ago. Your Lordship was conferred with this prestigious award and paved way for a 10-month long stay for mutual exchange of knowledge and understanding at the Law School University of Minnesota and Michigan State University, in the United States of America, respectively.
Your Lordship Justice Janak De Silvas Degrees of Bachelor of Civil Law awarded by the University of Oxford and the Master of law with merit in International Business Law awarded by the University of London are clear reflections on Your Lordships academic excellence. The strong foundation laid at the beginning of his legal education, passing with First-Class Honours in the Preliminary and Final Examinations at the Sri Lanka Law College would have been of immense support for the subsequent remarkable achievements.
Your Lordships skills in strong and effective advocacy with which cases were pursued before all Courts in your capacity as State Counsel, Senior State Counsel, Deputy Solicitor-General and Senior Deputy Solicitor-General, while representing the Attorney-General, are those which have prominent roots, even deep within Your Lordships student life. Your Lordship led both the Sinhala and English moot court teams and the English address to the Jury team at Sri Lanka Law College.
The Hector Jayawardane gold medal is awarded to the winner of the English address to the jury contest. Your Lordships oratorical skills were well-acknowledged and recognized with the awarding of this prestigious prize. Your Lordships interest, commitment and dedication as a Law Student are well-portrayed by another significant achievement.
Academic excellence combined with active participation in extra-curricular activities is rewarded by awarding the Walter Ladduwahetty gold medal. Your Lordships balanced and successful student life was further decorated and illuminated with the award of this prestigious gold medal.
Your Lordships commitment, dedication and seriousness with which a case would be pursued and the ability to take challenges, is aptly demonstrated in the hard-fought litigation relating to regulations promulgated by the Health Minister in pursuant to powers vested in him by the National Authority on Tobacco and Alcohol Act, relating to warnings on health hazards including pictorial health warnings on packets of cigarettes.
Constitutional Law, International Trade Law, International Economic Law and Legal Environment of Business are the areas in which Your Lordship undertook to impart your knowledge on the students pursuing their legal education at several institutions such as Sri Lanka Law College, University of Colombo and University of Sri Jayawardenepura.
My Lord Justice Janak De Silva, experience, expertise and skills Your Lordship acquired while serving as a Counsel and a Legal Advisor at the Attorney-Generals Department, coupled with the commitment and dedication Your Lordship demonstrates in discharging duties, no doubt would be of immense help to dispense, justice without fear or favour.
The Canadian Judicial Council recognizes; Litigants and others scrutinize judges very closely for any indication of unfairness. Unjustified reprimands of counsel, insulting and improper remarks about litigants and witnesses, statements evidencing prejudgment and intemperate and impatient behaviour may destroy the appearance of impartiality. On the other hand, judges are obliged to ensure that proceedings are conducted in an orderly and efficient manner and that courts process is not abused. An appropriate measure of firmness is necessary to achieve this end. A fine balance is to be drawn by judges who are expected both to conduct the process effectively and avoid creating in the mind of a reasonable, fair-minded and informed person any impression of a lack of impartiality.
Your Lordship Justice Gamini Rohan Amarasekera, Justice Anthoy Lalith Shiran Gooneratne and Justice Janak De Silva, we have no doubt that all virtues and qualities possessed by Your Lordships and expertise, experience and skills acquired while serving the society in Your Lordships respective capacities would guide and illuminate the path in Your Lordship new voyage.
My Lords, while assuring fullest cooperation of the Bar, may I wish Your Lordships be blessed with courage, strength and determination to meet all challenges successfully and travel through this path and reach greater heights, while dispensing justice to all parties who would appear before you.
Thank you.

Norwegian expert submits interim report on Uma Oya Project
Norwegian expert Bent Aagaard submitted the interim report on the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project to President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidents Official Residence in Colombo on Friday.
President Maithripala Sirisena said at the occasion that many problems had arisen during the implementation of the Uma Oya Multi-purpose Development Project as the previous government had hurriedly commenced the project without calling for a proper feasibility report and a Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA).
"The mistakes were done from the beginning and we are attempting to rectify them and ensure that the project would not create any issues in the future, the President said.
The expert said the preliminary studies had not forecast the possibility of large water seepage in the tunnel. He said the machinery used were not capable of strengthening the tunnel wall and seal them with strong grout materials.
"Excavation must be done with suitable machinery on the tunnel to ensure that there will be no seepage in the tunnel in the future," the expert said. He said the contractors had not prepared for large scale water ingress in the tunnel.
The expert said special grout materials and machinery should be used for tunnelling remaining four and half Km as a part of it is below the residential areas.
Aagaard said a comprehensive preliminary study could have prevented the water ingress that resulted in a severe water shortage in some areas.
The President requested the expert to provide a full report with his recommendations that help stop completely the leakage. The President asked him to provide the reasons for not taking into the consideration the water leakage in the previous reports.
The President said mega scale projects should not be commenced without proper studies. He said Uma Oya problems are lessons for the future.
Expert advice would be sought to implement the next project that comprises tunnelling of 22 Km, the President said.
Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Anura Dissanayake, the Project Director and the Norwegian Embassy officials participated.

Notts make world record Powerplay score
LONDON, Saturday : Alex Hales made a breathtaking 95 off 30 balls as Nottinghamshire piled up the highest Powerplay score in Twenty20 history in beating Durham.
The England opener hit nine sixes and nine fours to take Notts to 106-0 off the first six overs at Trent Bridge.
Hales, 28, almost equalled Chris Gayles fastest-ever T20 century, which came off 30 deliveries, but top-edged James Weighell to the wicketkeeper.
Notts chased down Durhams 183-7 in just 13.5 overs to win by five wickets.
Durham spinner Cameron Steel conceded 60 off his four overs.
Nottinghamshires 106 runs in the Powerplay overtook the previous best of 105-0 made by Kolkata Knight Riders against Royal Challengers Bangalore in the IPL earlier this year.
In the other North Group game, Ben Duckett hit an unbeaten 92 for Northants in their 24-run victory against Worcestershire at New Road.
Notts who now sit top of the group, had raced to 55-0 off 4.1 overs when a heavy rain shower forced the players off. On their return Hales and his opening partner Riki Wessels teed off.
Brydon Carses fifth over went for 27 either side of the rain delay, before Hales struck three sixes and two fours as 28 runs came off spinner Ryan Pringles sixth.
Hales cleared the rope three more times in Steels next over, meaning a staggering 75 runs had been scored in just 18 deliveries leaving Notts 126-0 off seven overs.
He eventually fell at the start of the eighth over, while attempting to drive Weighell for his 10th maximum.
Hales later said he was thinking about Gayles fastest T20 record during his innings.
The West Indians 30-ball hundred came in the 2013 IPL for Royal Challengers Bangalore and he finished with a world-record 175 not out.
Hales is now the leading scorer in the 2017 T20 Blast, with 445 runs in 10 innings at a strike-rate of more than 212.

Olivier keeps South Africa in fourth Test hunt
Manchester: Duanne Olivier took the prize wickets of England captain Joe Root and Ben Stokes as South Africa continued to fight back in the fourth Test at Old Trafford on Sunday.
England were 138 for six in their second innings, a lead of 274 runs, at tea on the third day.
Jonny Bairstow, fresh from his first-innings 99, was nought not out after 23 balls faced, with Moeen Ali unbeaten on four.
Pace bowler Olivier, only called up for this match after back injuries ruled out both Vernon Philander and Chris Morris, had taken two wickets for 13 runs in eight overs.
But it remained to be seen if South Africas struggling batsmen could mount a successful chase in the fourth innings on a wearing pitch.
England were bidding for a first home Test series win over South Africa since 1998 at 2-1 up with one to finish in this four-match contest.
Root was also in search of a victory in his first Test series as England skipper.
But after establishing a healthy first-innings lead of 136, England lost three wickets either side of lunch.
After Keaton Jennings had been dropped on nought by diving third slip Dean Elgar off Kagiso Rabada, fast bowler Morne Morkel removed Alastair Cook and Tom Westley.
Former captain Cook, Englands all-time leading Test run-scorer, had made 10 when he edged Morkel to Theunis de Bruyn in the gully.
Cooks Essex team-mate Westley then managed just nine in his fourth innings at this level before he too was caught in the gully.
The towering Morkel, whod so often bowled well this series without reward, had taken two for eight in 18 balls.
At lunch, England were 53 for two, with Jennings 17 not out and Root 13 not out.
But South Africa-born Jennings was unable to cash in on his reprieve. The Durham left-hander had added just one to his interval score when, trying to cut a Rabada ball that was too close to him, he edged to first slip Hashim Amla.
Prior to Sundays innings, there had been widespread speculation that the 25-year-old would be dropped for the start of Englands upcoming three-Test series at home to the West Indies, which precedes an Ashes tour of Australia.
And Jennings -- the 11th batsman chosen as an England opening partner for Cook since former captain Andrew Strauss retired in 2012 -- moved close to being axed after totalling just 127 runs in four Tests this series at an average of 15.88.
Finding batsmen good enough to cement a place in the top order alongside Cook and Root has long been a problem for Englands selectors.
Dawid Malan, out for scores of one and 10 on Test debut during Englands 239-run victory in the third Test at The Oval, was looking for a big score after falling for 18 in the first innings of this match.
But the Middlesex left-hander, born in London but brought up in South Africa, exited for six -- having been dropped on five -- when he gave a simple bat and pad catch to short leg off left-arm spinner Keshav Maharaj.
England were now wobbling at 72 for four.
But Root and Stokes added 57 valuable runs.
Root had made a composed 49, featuring six fours, when he played on to Olivier.
Olivier struck again when a ball angled across left-handed batsman Stokes, on 23, took an outside edge held by South Africa captain Faf du Plessis in the slips.
Earlier, Stuart Broad removed Olivier as the, nine down overnight, were dismissed for 226.
It meant James Anderson, Englands all-time leading wicket-taker -- was denied a maiden five-wicket Test innings haul on his Lancashire home ground.
But figures of four for 38 in 17 overs meant Anderson, whod struck four times from the newly-named James Anderson End on Saturday, had his best innings return in seven Tests at Old Trafford. AFP

Organising an Order
Anujanami Bhikkave Vassane Vassan Udaganja - I advise oh monks! To observe the rainy retreat during the Rainy Season, under one roof.
Just 21 days after the parinibbana of Buddha, Arahant Maha Kassapa decided that a great council must be held with the commencement of the rains retreat for the Sangha. It was held three months after the demise of the Buddha, at Sattapanni Rock Cave in Rajagaha, under the patronage of King Ajasattu.
The attitude of Bhikkhu Subhadda who believed that the Buddha had been curtailing their freedom prompted Elder Maha Kassapa Maha Thera to call for it. Subaddha, who became a monk in his old age advised the mourning monks to celebrate the Parinibbana of the Buddha. Celebrate brothers, said Subaddha. He asked them not to weep, but, be happy that now they can do what they want. The Master is no more; we are now free.
Beginnings
All matters concerning organising, planning and conducting was done under the supervision of Elder Maha Kassapa Maha Thera. The council was attended by 499 Arahant Theras at the beginning and Venerable Mahakassapa Thera kept the 500th seat vacant for Venerable Ananda Thera, who attained Arahathship on this Nikini poya day. The great Theravada Buddhist tradition flourishing today in countries such as Sri Lanka, Thailand, Burma, Laos and Cambodia has its beginnings in the first Council.
Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera sent a message to all the participants, that they should assemble in the hall constructed in front of Sapta Parni cave. In the morning Arahants took their seats according to seniority, in the gaily decorated hall. Arahant Upali, chief among the Vinaya experts, took a seat especially arranged in the centre and in reply to Maha Kassapa, he collated the Disciplinary code (Vinaya Pitaka)
Next, Arahant Ananda Thera took that special seat. As questioned and guided by Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera, he collated the entire code of Dhamma covering all five Nikayas. It was well known that all of those five hundred Arahant were experts on Dhamma and Vinaya.
Memorising
Having come to the end of first Sangayana (Council), Elder Maha Kassapa entrusted the responsibility of preserving through memorizing and passing down to posterity, all the books of entire code of discipline to the chief of Discipline, Arahant Upali Mahathera, and his retinue of pupils. Similarly, the responsibility of memorizing and preserving, and passing down to posterity all of the thirty-four long discourses grouped as Digha Nikaya to Arahant Ananda Thera and his retinue of pupils. The Middle Length Discourses (Majjima Nikaya) to Elder Sariputta Thera and his pupils. The Samyuktha Nikaya, to himself and his pupils, while the Anguttra Nikaya to Arahant Anuruddha Thera and his pupils.
The Buddhas appeal to Maha Kassapa Thera:
Dear Kassapa, please advise these Bhikkhus and guide them from faltering in their code of conduct. You must please counsel them regularly, now. Preach them the Dhamma too. Or else, I myself will have to do so.
O Lord, these Bhikkhus are now highly undisciplined. They are not amenable to correction. They often resort to their own ways. They do not show obedience or patience. They are not willing to abide by advice given to them for their own welfare and progress; instead, they often misconstrue and misunderstand it.
Opportunity
Arahant Maha Kassapa Thera possessed a variety of very special qualities and attributes, accumulated through a long period in samsara. He preferred to spend most of his days in meditation, maintaining silence for the greater part of the time. He preferred to be an example rather than advising others.
He spent his old age in the Jetawana Monastery at the request of the Buddha, though he wished to be in forest dwelling, a solitary life, away from society, depending on Pindapatha alone.
Maha Kassapa Thera considered it his responsibility and duty to safeguard the Buddha-Dhamma and the traditions of Bhikkhu life. Elder Kassapa can be regarded as the Deputy to the Buddha himself because it was he who placed the entire teaching well established for the world over through the first council which he conducted.
The commencement of Prathama Dhamma Sangayana[First Council], held after the passing away of the Buddha and Pasuvas or second opportunity for the monks who missed the commencement of rainy retreat on Esala poya were the important happenings on Nikini Poya.
The day is significant for many other reasons as well; other main events of Nikini full moon are, attaining Arahantship by Ananda Maha Thera, the Buddhas chief attendant and the world famous Kandy Esala Perahera that ends on this day making it more significant for Sri Lankans. Also, the laying of foundation stone for famous Seruwila Dagoba took place on a Nikini Full Moon.

Peoples right to vote should be ensured: Musthapha
The old electoral system should be abolished ensuring the people's right to vote. An election is a deciding factor of a country's future and therefore, a dialogue should be commenced by the PAFFERAL and other election monitoring organisations on the steps to be taken to protect the voting right of the people, Minister Faiszer Musthapha said.
The Minister was speaking at the occasion where a document was handed over to him by the PAFFERAL and other electoral organizations recently at the ministry.
The document aims to establish a legal framework which limit the expenditure that candidates spend on elections.
Minister Musthapha said propaganda expenditure on elections must be limited.
"The previous government spent enormously on the last elections and a developing country like Sri Lanka cannot afford such a wastage. A country cannot expect a morally sound leadership from candidates who spend enormously to influence voters. A broader dialogue should be built up in this regard, the minister said. The Minister promised to conduct a workshop to raise awareness on the issue for MPs and LG members very soon.
PAFFERAL Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi, Centre for Monitoring Election Violence (CMEV) National Coordinator Manjula Gajanayake and representatives of election monitoring organisations participated.

Poor batting cost us the Test - Chandimal
Test captain Dinesh Chandimal admitted that Sri Lanka lost the second Test to India at the SSC because of their poor batting display in the first innings.
Replying to Indias massive first innings of 622-9 declared, Sri Lanka was shot out for 183 and although they came up with a fighting batting display in their second innings to score 386 they still lost the Test by an innings.
We were completely outplayed. The first innings effort was disappointing and it cost us heavily. They batted well to score 622 which is huge. That put us under a lot of pressure, said Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
I am really pleased with the way we batted in the second innings. We fought hard. It was a fine effort by both Kusal Mendis and Dimuth Karunaratne. After yesterday (Saturday) we had some discussion and in those meetings we planned about how to go about things today. I still feel that everyone fought very hard but we kept losing wickets. We need to pick up the positives and look forward to the next game.
It was a special innings that Dimuth played. As an opener we expect that kind of innings from him, so were very happy he played that innings on a very tough deck like this one.
Of the innings that Ive seen over the last three or four years, this innings was one of the best  both from our team and oppositions. It was an excellent innings. He always goes to the crease looking to score runs. That must have helped him get the 141 runs, he said.
A majority of the strokes played by the Lankan batsmen against the Indian spinners Ravichandran Ashwin and Ravindra Jadeja were the sweeps and the reverse sweeps.
After the second days play we felt it was tough to bat on the pitch. We tried to play straight but we couldnt score well, explained Chandimal.
Before the second innings we had a discussion and had a chat about what was the best way to score runs. Everyone agreed that the best way moving forward was by using the sweep and reverse sweep shots heavily. We executed it really well in the second innings.
Sri Lanka went into the Test heavily reliant on spin with three spinners and one seamer, but suffered a setback when the solitary seamer Nuwan Pradeep broke down with a hamstring injury.
At the moment we have in our bowling two experienced bowlers, Rangana Herath and Dilruwan Perera. We had a wicket that turned and we expected them to come into the scene. But we couldnt execute those plans, said Chandimal.
Its really hard to play with one seamer. What we thought about is that under these conditions, the only way we could have balanced the team was with one seamer in the attack. That was the plan. Unfortunately he got injured and that became a big problem.
With Pradeep ruled out from about 2-3 weeks and Suranga Lakmal also on the injured list Sri Lanka are short of quality fast bowlers going into the third and final Test beginning in six days at Pallekele.
Yes its a bit of a disadvantage not to have Nuwan Pradeep and Suranga Lakmal. We havent made any decisions on selection because it was only in this match Nuwan got injured. We havent spoken to the selectors. We will make a plan in the future and try to execute that, said Chandimal.
We have four days now. We try to win every match. Even over the next few days we are hoping to spend a lot of time and energy in training. If we can win even one match against a team like India, we will be able to really boost the mental state of the team. They are the no. 1 team. The staff and everyone else will be really committed at training.

Ravindra Jadeja suspended for Pallekele Test
Indias Ravindra Jadeja has been suspended for the upcoming Pallekele Test after his accumulated demerit points reached six within a 24-month period following his latest breach of the ICC Code of Conduct for which he received a 50 per cent fine and three demerit points.
During the third days play in the Colombo Test against Sri Lanka on Saturday, Jadeja was found guilty of breaching article 2.2.8 of the ICC Code of Conduct for Player and Player Support Personnel, which relates to throwing a ball (or any other item of cricket equipment such as a water bottle) at or near a Player, Player Support Personnel, Umpire, Match Referee or any other third person in an inappropriate and/or dangerous manner during an International Match.
As Jadeja had received a 50 per cent fine and three demerit points during the Indore Test against New Zealand in October 2016 for violating 2.2.11 of the Code, with the addition of Saturdays three demerit points, he has reached the threshold of four demerit points, which, pursuant to article 7.6 of the Code, have now been converted into two suspension points*.
As such, Jadeja has been suspended from his sides third Test against Sri Lanka, which will be played in Pallekele from 12-16 August.
Following this suspension, the six demerit points will remain on Jadejas disciplinary record. If Jadeja reaches the next threshold of eight or more demerit points within a 24-month period, then they will be converted into four suspension points**.
Saturdays incident happened on the final delivery of the 58th over when Jadeja, after fielding off his own bowling, threw the ball back at the batsman who had not left his crease. The on-field umpires deemed the throwing in a dangerous manner as it narrowly missed Dimuth Karunaratne.
Jadeja admitted the offence and accepted the sanction proposed by Richie Richardson of the Emirates Elite Panel of ICC Match Referees and, as such, there was no need for a formal hearing.
The charge was laid by on-field umpires Bruce Oxenford and Rod Tucker, third umpire Richard Illingworth and fourth umpire Ruchira Palliyaguruge. All level 2 breaches carry an imposition of a fine between 50 per cent to 100 per cent of the applicable match fee and/or up to two suspension points, and three or four demerit points.

Reflections on death
All of us know that life is impermanent. We may die today or tomorrow, or we may live another ten, twenty-five or fifty years. But eventually we have to die.
People normally think of death as the end of human life. If life was as simple as this, then this would encourage us to fritter away our time with no purpose. But according to Buddhism, our life does not begin only at the moment of birth; and death too, does not imply the end of everything. We will have another life after death.
We will be reborn in another place and the cycle of life and death will continue endlessly. The constant rebirth into this suffering world is a bigger problem than the simple death at the end of each life. Constant rebirth is difficult to solve and it becomes a critical issue when we recognize and wish to overcome it.
Balance Sheet
This situation reminds me of my days in corporate sector. We used to start our business at the beginning of the financial year (1 April) and at the end of the year (31 March), we had to prepare a Trading and Profit and Loss account and Balance Sheet. The net profits, assets, liabilities and unsettled bills are carried forward to the next year.
This process repeats the following financial year, and every year thereafter until the day I severe connection with the organization. Intelligent corporate leaders plan to accumulate long term profits and increasingly valuable assets year after year. But this is not an easy task to fulfil.
How should we handle this problem We can be more confident about the following years financial position if the current years business is stable and profitable. Everything will then run more smoothly next year. However, if this year results in a loss, then next years financial position will be tight. We may have to undergo difficulties, causing a lot of frustration, worry, and suffering for ourselves.
Life is the same. During the process between life and death, we have to develop merits (punna) and cut down demerits (papa), and this will certainly be a gain. If we improve ourselves and become a better person in this life, then we have created good prospects for our future lives.
Death
Let us first clarify our misunderstandings about "death" before we discuss "life". People normally have a fear of death. In fact, death is nothing to be afraid of. This is similar to the businessman who runs a business and manages it well developing an asset base until the closure of the financial year. When the New Year comes he will certainly enjoy a comfortable life. Therefore, as long as we have prepared well during our current lives (following our Dhamma principle), we will not be frightened when death comes.
In order to gain an understanding of the preciousness of life and how to make it meaningful we need to reflect on few points. (1) there is no possible way to escape death, (2) life has a definite, inflexible limit and each moment brings us closer to the end of this life, and (3) death may come at an unexpected moment.
When we reflect on these points, it can help us to realize that life is short and precious and that there is no time to lose. It can be very helpful when getting up each day to say to ourselves "today may be the last day of my life, let me live it therefore by making it as meaningful as possible, being of benefit to others."
Mortality
Buddhism teaches that we should not shrink from the fact of death but squarely confront it. Our contemporary culture has been described as one that seeks to avoid and deny the fundamental question of our mortality. It is the awareness of death, however, that compels us to examine our lives and to seek to live meaningfully.
Death enables us to treasure life; it awakens us to the preciousness of each shared moment. In the struggle to navigate the sorrow of death, we can forge a radiant treasure of fortitude in the depths of our being. Through that struggle, we become more aware of the dignity of life and more readily able to empathize with the suffering of others.
Desire
Everything in the universe, everything that happens, is part of a vast living web of interconnection. The vibrant energy we call life which flows throughout the universe has no beginning and no end. Life is a continuous, dynamic process of change.
Early Buddhist teachings, however, saw this process as one of inevitable suffering and focused on the possibility of opting out of it.
The Buddha perceived that desire is the fundamental impulse that drives life onward, tying us into the cycle of birth and death. At each moment, impulses of various desires prompt thought, speech and action, which comprise the latent force of our individual karma. Through these causes and effects, actions and reactions, we shape ourselves and our circumstances from instant to instant, perpetuating a fluid process that has continued over countless existences.
Moreover, the Buddha taught there is no permanent soul or self that has existed throughout all this time but simply the continuity of karmic energy that generates the illusion of an unchanging essence or self.
Eliminating desire, then, would cut off the energy that fuels the cycle of life and death, and at death, ones life would be extinguished once and for all. This blissful state of annihilation  nirvana - was the final goal of early Buddhist teachings and continues to be regarded as such in Buddhist traditions today. Life, in this perspective, is a cycle of suffering from which one can eventually escape.
Four ways
According to Buddhism, Death can occur in any one of these four ways:
It can be due to the exhaustion of the life span assigned to beings of the particular species. This type of death is called Ayukkhaya. It can be due to the exhaustion of the Karmic energy that caused the birth of the deceased. This is called karmakkhaya. It can be due to the simultaneous exhaustion of the above mentioned two causes  Ubhayakkhaya. And lastly, it can be due to external circumstances, viz, accidents, untimely happenings  working of natural phenomenon. This is called Upacchedake.
There is an excellent analogy to explain these four types of death. It is the analogy of the oil lamp. The light in the oil lamp can be extinguished due to any one of four causes:-
The wick in the lamp burns up. This is likened to death through the exhaustion of the life span. The consummation of the oil in the lamp is likened to death through exhaustion of the Karmic energy. The consummation o the oil in the lamp and the burning off of the wick at the same time  is likened to death occurring through the combination of causes described in (i) and (ii) occurring simultaneously; and the effect of external factors such as the wind blowing out the light  is likened to death caused through external factors.
Therefore, Karma alone is not the cause of death. There are external contributory causes also. The Buddhas teaching categorically states that Karma does not explain all happenings in our lives.
Overcome
Can we overcome death The answer is  Yes, we can. This repetition of countless births or Samsara has to be stopped. It can be done only by deeply understanding Avijja (Ignorance) and Tanha (desire). These are the roots in this cycle of births and have to be exterminated. If we manage to do that, birth is overcome, death is conquered and Samsara is transcended and Nirvana is attained.

Resettling displaced families accelerated
The resettlement of families who get displaced due to the construction of the proposed Yan Oya reservoir has been accelerated.
Irrigation Minister Vijith Vijayamuni Soyza said at a special meeting held at the Yan Oya Project Office that those who were living on land demarcated for the project would be resettled before the construction commenced.
Eighty one families in the Horowpothana Divisional Secretariat Division and 135 families in the Gomarankawada DS Division are being granted Rs. 228 million for housing. The affected families are given lands to construct houses at Mailawewa and Kajuwaththa in the Gomarankadawala area in Trincomalee and at Issnawewa and Omaradaka in the Horowpothana DS Division in the Anuradhapura district.
The resettlement scheme is supervised by Horowpothana District Divisional Secretary M. Mubarak and Gomarankadawala Division Secretary Chandana Samarakoon.
Anuradhapura Government Agent R. M. Wanninayake said that those who are losing their lands due to the Yan Oya project would be paid compensation for their land soon.
He said providing land was in progress
The landless families would be given 1 3/4 acre of land. Wanninayake said.
He said the families who had left their villages due to the war and terrorism and are living in the project area would be considered for land and financial dividends.
The resettling families are allowed to get sand from the project area, the AG said.

SLITHM grads are countrys tourism ambassadors: Minister
New graduates have a big responsibility to ensure that they protect the good name of the SLITHM and that of the country as their services will more often be directed towards foreigners, Tourism Development and Christian Religious Affairs Minister John Amaratunga said
They will be the countrys tourism ambassadors and their actions, talents, knowledge and skills acquired through training at the SLITHM will define the success of the industry in the years to come, he said.
He was addressing the 38th Graduation Ceremony of the institution held at the BMICH recently as its Chief Guest. A total of 77 students passed out as full-fledged graduates at the ceremony.
I request the 77 graduates to first serve their motherland before seeking overseas exposure as Sri Lanka needs their services at this defining moment in its tourism industry, the minister said.
Sri Lanka is well known the world over as a very hospitable nation. In the recent past, we have seen some adverse media reports that tourists have been exploited. Today social media is a very powerful tool and one bad experience can instantly influence thousands of others, he cautioned.
The SLITHM main campus in Colombo is South Asias first purpose designed training facility offering students a holistic education experience in the different aspects of tourism and hospitality. It has developed an extensive network of satellite schools across the country to attract and train youth in hospitality.
In addition to the satellite schools in Kandy, Anuradhapura, Koggala, Bandarawela, Ratnapura and Kurunegala, new schools have opened in Hambantota, Passikuda, Polonnaruwa and Negombo.
Rather than waiting for students to come to us, we are going to their doorstep, Minister Amaratunga said.
The industry requires thousands of new workers. Therefore, the SLITHM has doubled its output of trained students from 3,000 per year to nearly 7,000 per year.
Today we have a serious issue with regard to manpower in the tourism and hospitality sectors. The demand is more than the supply. This is because of the continuing expansion of the hotel sector while the youth continue to focus on the more traditional career paths. The result is that many lucrative job opportunities go a begging, Minister Amaratunga said.
He said females still hesitated to join the industry due to ill-conceived notions.
There is a misconception among our youth especially among females that the hospitality trade is not suitable for them. This is a baseless, ill-informed and outdated theory. Today an entry level job in the hotel industry pays twice as much as any other field as a hotel employee is entitled to two monthly payments, namely the basic salary and service charge.
When these two are combined and factored with other benefits such as free meals, accommodation, medical benefits so on, the income is much higher than other fields, Minister Amaratunga said.
SLITHM Chairman Sunil Dissanayake said the SLITHM has a history of innovation, growth and change. Inaugurated in 1966.
Today we have earned local and global recognition as the premier institute for hospitality and tourism management education in Sri Lanka and the region. We have been the backbone of the hospitality industry of Sri Lanka from its infancy, producing the required professional human resources for the hospitality industry, he said.
The Sri Lanka Institute of Tourism and Hotel Management (SLITHM) may well be the only seat of higher educational learning in Sri Lanka with two significant milestones in its 50-year existence. It has not had to shut down a single day because of student unrest, and every individual passed out from it has found employment with the unemployment rate remaining frozen at zero, the SLITHM Chairman said.
With the industry estimating nearly 150,000 new direct employees by 2020 to serve Sri Lankas growing visitor base, last year alone 5,300 students passed out of the SLITHM, of them 88 were graduates. This year the planned output is 6,900. We aim to provide high quality, affordable and practically relevant education for the industry and in doing so we aim to achieve degree awarding status for an academic (Hons) Degree in Tourism and Hospitality Management whilst focusing on achieving National Vocational Qualifications (NVQ) levels for our professional courses.With the facilitation of Chartered Management Accountants (CMA) finance for hotel accounting courses were introduced, primarily catering to finance professionals in the hotel and catering industry and those aspiring for a career in hotel finance, Dissanayake said. Chairman Dissanayake said he was happy to note that all of the 77 new graduates had already found employment.
He said the SLITHM was reviewing and amending its curricula to align it with current industry requirements by seeking the views and closely working with the Hotels Association of Sri Lanka.

China and Sri Lanka have a long Buddhist cultural relationship. Since the beginning of the fifth century, the king of the Sinhaladeepa sent the Master Dharma to the Liu Song Dynasty to offer Buddha statues. Master Fa-xian went to Sinhaladeepa seeking Buddhist sutras in the early eigth century. Vajrabodhi and his disciple Amoghavajra preached Buddhism between the two countries until the beginning of the 11th century. Monk Miao-de and others in Sinhaladeepa went to the Zhao Song Dynasty and offered relics, Sanskrit clips. This is reliable evidence; it can be seen in historical records for more than 600 years.

The 35-year-old American, who won the world title in 2005 a year after winning the Olympic gold in the Athens Games a year earlier, said he had done his time in serving a four-year ban (2006-10) for doping.
The prospect of Gatlin becoming world champion had made Sebastian Coe, prior to him becoming president of the sport's governing body the IAAF, feel queasy. And the American had been roundly booed when it was announced he had won with Bolt in third.
Whle Gatlin raised a finger to his lips in defiance of their jeering, the crowd then chanted Bolt's name.
However, Gatlin insisted he was no bad boy and said he should be treated like anyone who is given a second chance by society.
I'm just a runner, said Gatlin.
I'm back in the sport. I've done my time and I've come back.
I've done community service, I've talked to kids, I've actualy inspired kids to walk the right path.
That's all I can do. Society does that for people who make mistakes. That's why I'm still back in the sport, still running and believe in myself.
Bolt, who said he would not be rethinking his plans to retire after his stellar career, also defended Gatlin's right to compete although the Jamaican had not been so generous when another American, Tyson Gay, had tested positive and then returned.
He's done his time and if he's here it means it's okay, Bolt said of Gatlin.
I always respect him as a competitor. He's one of the best competitors I've ever competed against.
He deserves to be here because he's done his time and has worked hard to get back here. I look at him as any other athlete.
Bolt also called disrespectful a suggestion that overall slow seasonal times were linked to a more efficient anti-doping testing programme, saying it was more down to either injuries, loss of form or even negative wind.
Gatlin, though, tried to shrug off the hostile reception he had received throughout the qualifying rounds and then when he won.
Not at all, this was Usain's night, his last race, said Gatlin of the boos when he won. He has my utmost respect and this was his night, win or lose He is still the man.
I guess they booed me because I have become such a rival for him.
There were no boos from 2010 through to 2015, but really I got the most pleasure from the way I stuck in there and came back.
Gatlin said he didn't know if he would call it a day now that he had succeeded in beating Bolt in a championship final -- just his second win over the 30-year-old in 10 meetings.
Look ,when I got the four-year ban I thought I was through and then I decided I should come back and resume training and see how it went, he said.
For a millisecond when I crossed the line tonight I thought of retiring but now I wll see the season through.  AFP

Thompson out to restore Jamaican pride in the women's 100m
LONDON, Sunday - After Usain Bolt's defeat, fellow Jamaican Elaine Thompson will seek to restore the country's sprint status by adding the World Championship 100 metres crown to her Olympic gold on Sunday.
Thompson, who also won the 200m at the Rio Games last year, is the favourite going into the race as compatriot and three-time world champion Shelly-Ann Fraser-Pryce misses out while she prepares for the birth of her first child.
The 25-year-old Thompson will be challenged by Dafne Schippers of the Netherlands and Tori Bowie of the U.S., who claimed the silver and bronze medals in the same event in Beijing two years ago.
The women's heptathlon also reaches its climax on Sunday in the London Stadium. Germany's Carolin Schafer leads the standings, with Olympic champion Nafi Thiam of Belgium in second with three events remaining.
The first medals of the day come in the marathon, with the men's event beginning at 10:55 local time, with Daniel Wanjiru of Kenya looking to secure a London double, having won the city marathon in April. The women's event begins at 14:00. Both races start and finish at Tower Bridge.
There are also gold medals to be won in the women's pole vault and the men's shot put.  Agencies

UN toughens sanctions on North Korea
UN: The UN Security Council on Saturday unanimously backed a US-drafted resolution that significantly strengthened sanctions on North Korea, imposing a ban on exports aimed at depriving Pyongyang of $1 billion in annual revenue.
The sweeping measures were the first of that scope to be imposed on North Korea since US President Donald Trump took office and highlighted China's willingness to punish its Pyongyang ally.
The resolution imposed a full ban on exports of coal, iron and iron ore, lead and lead ore as well as fish and seafood by the cash-starved state -- stripping North Korea of a third of its export earnings estimated at $3 billion per year.
US Ambassador Nikki Haley said the stiffer measures brought the penalty imposed on North Korea for its ballistic missile tests to a whole new level and that the council had put leader Kim Jong-Un on notice.
This is the most stringent set of sanctions on any country in a generation, Haley told the council after the vote.
These sanctions will cut deep and in doing so, will give the North Korean leadership a taste of the deprivation they have chosen to inflict on the North Korean people.
The resolution also prevents North Korea from increasing the number of workers it sends abroad whose earnings are another source of revenue for Kim's regime. It prohibits all new joint ventures with the isolated nation, bans new investment in the current joint companies and adds nine North Korean officials and four entities including the country's main foreign exchange bank to the UN sanctions blacklist.
If fully implemented, the measures would tighten the economic vise around Pyongyang as it seeks to develop its missile and nuclear programs.
Trump hailed the unanimous vote, saying on Twitter the sanctions will have very big financial impact!
In a statement released several hours later, he specifically commended China and Russia for their votes.
The President appreciates China's and Russia's cooperation in securing passage of this resolution, said the White House.
He will continue working with allies and partners to increase diplomatic and economic pressure on North Korea to end its threatening and destabilizing behavior.
The United States entered into negotiations with China a month ago on the new resolution after Pyongyang launched its first intercontinental ballistic missile on July 4, which was followed by a second test on July 28.
But the measure does not provide for cuts to oil deliveries to North Korea as initially proposed by the United States -- a move that would have dealt a serious blow to the economy.
The new raft of embargoes are the seventh set of UN sanctions imposed on North Korea since it first carried out a nuclear test in 2006.
The United States has put heavy pressure on China, which accounts for 90 percent of trade with North Korea, to enforce the sanctions and the fate of these measures largely hinges on Beijing's cooperation.
China and Russia had resisted the US push, arguing that dialogue with North Korea was the way to persuade Pyongyang to halt its military programs.
Chinese Ambassador Liu Jieyi said the resolution does not intend to cause a negative impact to North Korea's people and stressed that it called for a return to talks on denuclearization of the Korean peninsula.
The fact that the council adopted this resolution unanimously demonstrates that the international community is united in its position regarding the nuclear issue of the peninsula, said Liu.
Russian Ambassador Vasily Nebenzia stressed that sanctions cannot be an end in themselves but rather a tool for engaging this country in constructive talks.
Backed by Japan, South Korea and its European allies, the United States has maintained that tougher sanctions would put pressure on North Korea to come to the table. - AFP

Zverev rips Nishikori, faces Anderson for title
WASHINGTON: Germany's Alexander Zverev dominated Japan's Kei Nishikori 6-3, 6-4 Saturday in a showdown of top-10 rivals to reach the ATP and WTA Citi Open final against South Africa's Kevin Anderson.
Zverev, ranked a career-best eighth this week, dropped only seven points on his serve and never faced a break point in the 63-minute affair, extending ninth-ranked Nishikori's ATP title drought to 30 events over 18 months.
The 20-year-old from Hamburg will try for his fifth career title and fourth of the year Sunday against 45th-ranked Anderson, who ousted 19th-ranked American Jack Sock 6-3, 6-4 on the Washington hardcourts.
Getting the hardcourt season started with a win would be great, Zverev said.
Zverev dominated from the start, winning the first 10 points and 12 of the first 13, Nishikori netting a backhand to surrender a decisive break at love in the second game. Both men held from there, Zverev taking the first set in 28 minutes.
Zverev hit a forehand winner to break for a 2-1 lead in the second set and held to the finish, claiming victory when Nishikori netted a forehand.
I played a great match, Zverev said. I started 3-0. That helped the confidence. I played really well. Zverev, whose fourth-round Wimbledon run was his Grand Slam best, won 31-of-33 first-serve points, all 13 in the first set, and 9-of-14 on his second serve.
Zverev is 2-0 against Anderson, winning a 2015 Washington second-round match and a first-round meeting in May on his way to the Rome title, his third crown of 2017 after Montpellier and Munich.
It's going to be a tough match. Alex has had a great year, Anderson said. For me it's really focusing on things I can do and playing the best I can. Anderson reached his first final since winning his third career ATP title in 2015 at Winston-Salem. The lanky 31-year-old from Johannesburg also won at Delray Beach in 2012 and his hometown in 2011.
Nishikori, the 2015 Washington champion, last raised a trophy at Memphis in February 2016, a run that includes six finals losses.
I don't feel like last year yet, but I feel like if I keep playing my best tennis it will come back, Nishikori said.
Nishikori was also tired after two long matches that finished after midnight because of rain. Just a bit tough this week, Nishikori said. I had two matches finish at 2 a.m. It wasn't easy to go to sleep. It's not the same when you go to sleep at 4 a.m. It has been a little bit crazy.
