Record number of Southern SLFPers to party convention: Chief Minister

A record number of SLFP members from the Southern Province will participate in the party convention regardless of reproachful statements and destructive decisions by some pro-joint opposition regional leaders, said Southern Province Chief Minister Shan Wijayalal de Silva.
He was addressing a gathering of party activists in Ambalangoda on Monday.
Some local leaders with allegiance to the Joint Opposition who convene party men for meetings make critical comments on the SLFP 65th anniversary convention. Whatever decisions they take over the party anniversary, such resolutions do not represent the party majoritys will or ambition. Despite their disruptive moves, a massive number of member participation to the party anniversary is certain. The forthcoming party convention will be the most exceptional party anniversary in the party's history, the Chief Minister said. Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said that he would not form a new party. However, his brother, former Minister Basil Rajapaksa said that they would contest under a new symbol at future elections. The tale of establishing a new party is a cheap political ploy of the Joint Opposition.
It is a dreamlike assurance to further fool their followers who rally round them naively, he said.
