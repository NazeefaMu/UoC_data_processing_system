Fox and Green  reunite

The cast of the 3D action comedy film 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows', are hoping for the American actress Megan Fox and the 'Terminator' actor Brian Austin Green to make it as a couple. As stated by PEOPLE, Fox is pregnant with the celebrity couple's third baby. Fox and Green already have two young children - three year old Noah and two year old Bodhi.
However, it has been reported that Fox filed for divorce from Brian last summer. The couple had been sharing family time since that point, but, Megan and Brian are not acting like a married couple. Despite of that, Megan and Brian are trying their best to make things work for the sake of their children.
TV 3 reported that the American television and film actress - Brittany Ishibashi, is hopeful that the couple's third baby will help Fox and Austin Green fully reconcile.
Brittany, who portrays Karai in the 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Out of the Shadows' film, stated that she was excited to hear Megan's pregnancy and Brittany recalled Megan's dedication to her family while on set.
Ishibashi stated, "I have a 2-year-old. We bonded over kids. And I worked with Brian Austin Green a few years ago on 'Desperate Housewives'. He's such a sweet guy. They are both such sweet people - super chill. They're very spiritual people, very kind and generous. And she's an amazing mother. She was always talking about her kids and FaceTiming with her kids. And I think Brian's a great dad. They're such cool people." Ishibashi also talked about being hopeful after she knew that Megan and Brian recently spent time together vacationing in Hawaii. Ishibashi said, "I was like, 'Aw, there you go, guys. And the big island on Hawaii is a very special place, very spiritual - that's where they got married, at the Four Seasons on the big island of Hawaii, at Hualalai. And they were back there."

Oh, for a  Kulasekara  in England

Sri Lanka hit by injuries to Dhammika Prasad and Dushmantha Chameera and having Shaminda Eranga reported for a suspect bowling action on their current tour of England would have dearly loved Nuwan Kulasekara in their line-up for the third and final Test beginning at Lords on Thursday.
Unfortunately for them Kulasekara with 21 Test caps and 48 Test wickets behind him announced his retirement from the longer version of the game at the beginning of the month to focus his attention on the sports shorter formats in which he is considered a greater threat with the ball.
It was at Lords that Kulasekara made his highest Test score of 64 - the only half-century he scored in that format, and helped Sri Lanka earn a honourable draw against England after being made to follow-on 359 runs in arrears.
That remarkable rearguard action took place on the 2006 tour when Sri Lanka shot out for 192 in their first innings in reply to Englands mammoth total of 551-6 declared made a tremendous fight back to deprive the host of a likely victory. Sri Lanka eventually ended on a handsome 537 for nine wickets having batted a marathon 199 overs and keeping England on the field for two and a half days.
Skipper Mahela Jayawardene played a captains knock of 119 in six hours, but after his dismissal at 371 Sri Lanka were still not safe from defeat. It was here that Sri Lankas late order and the tail showed guts and gumption.
Tillakaratne Dilshan batting at number seven scored 69 off 145 balls, but after his dismissal at 421-8 Sri Lanka were not out of danger yet.
It was at this point that Kulasekara joined Chaminda Vaas to frustrate England and earn Sri Lanka a creditable draw. The pair put on 105 for ninth wicket with Kulasekaras share in the partnership being a gallant 64 off 133 balls.
He defied the England bowlers comprising Hoggard, Flintoff, Mahmood, Plunkett, Collingwood and Panesar for 189 minutes.
When Kulasekara was finally dismissed Vaas left unbeaten on 50.
The Cricinfo match report stated: When England enforced the follow-on nobody expected them to need a third new ball; even this was repelled by the lower-order. Panesar was introduced with a relatively hard ball and Kulasekara twice lofted him over midwicket, the second of which brought up a maiden Test fifty off 92 balls and also carried Sri Lanka past 500.
In the first innings Kulasekaras 29 was nothing more than an annoyance, his second effort turned into one of the more memorable rearguards and the highest score by a Sri Lankan No. 10.
Kulasekaras final Test appearance for Sri Lanka was also against England at Lords two years ago.
What Test cricket will be missing is Kulasekaras lovely smooth action which helps him to hurl the ball at a lively pace, getting enough seam movement both ways to trouble the batsman. His skills lie in his ability to produce inswing and he is well known for his moderate nature to the batsmen, seldom being overly aggressive. He is regarded as one of the best swing bowlers currently playing cricket.
Kulasekara came of age in the year 2008, when he took 47 wickets  which propelled him to the top spot in the ICC ODI rankings for bowlers in March 2009. The retirement of Vaas and the inconsistency of Lasith Malinga proved to be a boon for Kulasekara as he leapfrogged them to emerge as the strike bowler of his side.
Despite lacking express pace Kulasekara made the most of his ability to swing the new ball and has been a standout performer in ODIs as his 186 wickets from 173 matches prove.
So it is no surprise that the 33-year-old fast bowler has decided to continue to play for Sri Lanka in the two shorter formats  50 overs and T20.
In the present context of what the team is undergoing in England, Sri Lanka would dearly love to have someone of Kulasekaras ability in the side not only to boost their bowling line up but also the tail which the current lot apart from Rangana Herath have fallen short of delivering.

Australia  thrashes Windies

PROVIDENCE: David Warner scored an unbeaten half century as Australia romped to a six-wicket thrashing of West Indies in their opening Tri-Nation Series day-night game at the Guyana National Stadium on Sunday.
Warners 55 not out saw Australia home with almost 25 overs to spare after the West Indies earlier collapsed from 50 for one to 116 all out from 32.3 overs.
Australia then wasted little time in getting to the modest target, Warner anchoring the effort to ensure a victory that was never in doubt despite the loss of three wickets for seven runs with the end in sight.
Spinners Sunil Narine, with two wickets in one over, and Sulieman Benn caused the discomfort but it was not enough to save the hosts.
The emphatic victory earned Australia a bonus point to move ahead of the West Indies in the three-team standings before Tuesdays final game at Providence against South Africa.
Our batting is a real concern, said West Indies coach Phil Simmons.
The bowlers and fielding side are doing a great job but we need to get it together with the bat for the next two matches in St Kitts.
Boosted by a four-wicket win in the tournament-opener against the South Africans at the same venue two days earlier, the West Indies plummeted back down to earth at the feet of the World Cup-holders, whose frontline spinners Nathan Lyon and Adam Zampa did the bulk of the damage with three wickets apiece after the usual effective opening burst from Mitchell Starc. I really enjoyed it out there on that pitch, Zampa enthused after his performance.
South Africa will be a big challenge though on Tuesday with so many quality batsmen.
Playing his first international match for more than six months after being sidelined by injury, the left-arm fast bowler breached the defences of openers Andre Fletcher and Johnson Charles to finish with figures of two for 37 from nine overs.
He showed signs of rustiness in delivering five wides and a no-ball, however his lethal pace proved more than a handful for the West Indies top order.
Starcs tally of ODI wickets is now at 92 in his 47th match and should he take eight more before the end of this competition he will eclipse Pakistans Saqlain Mustaq for the record as the fastest to 100 wickets in terms of matches played in this format of the international game.
Charles topscored with a chancy 22 while all-rounder Carlos Brathwaite was last out for 21, Aaron Finch taking the catch at long-on to give Zampa his third wicket.
Notwithstanding the turgid surface, the home batsmen contributed to their swift demise with a succession of poor shots, exemplified by Darren Bravos loose cover-drive at seamer Mitchell Marsh which offered a straightforward catch to Zampa at cover.
Lyon, the experienced off-spinner, had an almost instant impact in disposing of Marlon Samuels and Kieron Pollard off successive deliveries. AFP

Nadal to be fit for Wimbledon

Rafael Nadal has whisked his girlfriend Xisca Perello away on holiday off the coast of Spain as the tennis star looks to put his injury nightmare behind him after pulling out of the French Open.
Nadal was forced to withdraw from Roland Garros due to a tendon injury but he took this mind off his ailment as he soaked up the Balearic sun in Formentera near Ibiza. Nadal, who turned 30 last Friday, had only reached the second round when he was forced to pull out of his attempts at a 10th French Open title after tests showed his condition had deteriorated.
He explained during a press conference that an anesethic injection had been able to get him through his match against Facundo Bagnis but he now faces an anxious race to be fit for Wimbledon.
His hopes are hanging by a thread after he withdrew from the Aegon Championships at Queens Club. The Spaniard explained that an MRI scan revealed the extent of the injury with the negative results showing an inflammation on the sheath of the tendon, with three months out being the worst-case scenario.
The 14-time Grand Slam champion was concerned that had he not acted, it would have led to a longer period off the circuit, but he is hopeful that the recovery time will take just three weeks. DAILY MAIL

Ammo dump sited in densely populated area: JVP

The setting up of an ammunition dump in a densely populated area is highly questionable and a wrong move, JVP parliamentarian Vijitha
Herath said. Addressing the media at the JVP party office, Battaramulla yesterday, Herath said the Army Camp was established in Kosgama in 1994 despite protests against the decision taken by the then government.
This area was not suitable for an Army camp since it is a congested civilian area.
We also submitted petitions against this decision to a minister of the then government Indika Gunawardane. Without considering the protests, the then government had taken measures to establish an armoury.
It was also reported that all weapons stored at the Panagoda Army Camp were also shifted to the Kosgama armoury, the MP said. Herath said the Naigala Physically Handicapped War Heroes Village and Salawa Hospital are also situated in this highly populated area. The Kosgama Salawa Army Camp is situated close to the Colombo - Avissawella High Level Road, he said. The MP added that the government should take a decision over the continuation of this armoury in this area after considering the gravity of the damage and the risk of maintaining such an armoury.
He emphasised the need to conduct an immediate investigation into this incident and provide compensation to the affected families.
