Ranil should graciously step down
Since President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa are humane leaders who are lenient in executing their powers, the best thing Ranil Wickremesinghe should do at this moment was to graciously move out from Temple Trees and take up the Opposition Leaders post, said Western Provincial Council SLPP member Jagath Kumara. He was addressing a press briefing held at the Battaramulla Samurdhi Union office on October 31.
Jagath Kumara said he was making a request from Wickremesinghe to act according to the law without inciting people to get on to the streets in the future.
He recalled that former President Mahinda Rajapaksa left Temple Trees official residence the moment he lost the Presidential Election and it was this law-abiding gesture on his part which enabled the SLPP to gain victory at the last Local Government elections. He said President Sirisena had taken a wise decision to appoint Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister to resurrect the economy which had crashed and people were closely observing Ranil Wickremesinghes response to it. There seemed to be a division within the UNP ranks today and many UNPers were waiting to crossover to the government.
SLPP members of the Kaduwela UC, Nilantha Pushpakumara, Ranjith Kaluhapuge and Sriyani Liyanage were also present.

No more excessive tax burdens: PM
Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said the government must ensure that taxes will not become a burden to the public.
He also said the tax collection system should be simplified. Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was speaking after assuming duties as the Finance and Economic Affairs Minister at the Ministry premises yesterday.
Premier Rajapaksa assured that he will transform Sri Lanka into a country with rapid development and progress in the region by building an economy which brings dividends to all sectors of the country.
He also stressed the importance of putting an end to the era of imposing excessive burden of taxes on people. He further said that with the high cost of living at present, the government will take steps to provide relief to the public in future.
As it was reported the economic growth of the country is less than three percent and the cost of living has also risen. Both direct and indirect taxes have been taken in to a complex situation. The entire business sector of the country has collapsed. High interest rates have also become a burden to the public. The unstable inflation rate has resulted in the instability of the economy and the political situation in the country.
Though the countrys budget deficit has been reduced to five percent, it has been done by cutting off development expenses. Those who are now shedding tears for democracy have completely violated the countrys democracy by postponing holding elections. They are trying to point out that President Maithripala Sirisena is the only President who has prorogued Parliament. Parliament was scheduled to be convened on November 5 and it was prorogued only for 11 days. Late President Premadasa prorogued Parliament for a few months. But his son cant remember that history. They are trying to show the entire world that we are leading the country towards dictatorship, he said.
Prime Minister Rajapaksa further said that the fuel price formula has to be revised and a new mechanism should be introduced to bring the fuel prices in the market under control. He said the fuel price formula raised many concerns among the public.
The Prime Minister said since at present everything is imported the local farmer has been unfairly treated. In future, priority will be given to local products and make the country self-sufficient to give local farmers an opportunity.
He also stressed the importance of safeguarding the countrys foreign reserves. We have to implement an economic policy which could improve all sectors, including exports, tourism and foreign employment. Local and foreign investors will have to play the key role in this process, the Premier said.

Once Parliament is prorogued, only the President has the power to convene Parliament prior to November 16. The Presidential Proclamation states that Parliament would be convened on November 16, 2018. No one else but the President has the power to change that. Article 70 was substituted by the 19th Amendment and accordingly, the President may, by proclamation, prorogue and dissolve Parliament and now under sub-article 70(3) only the President has the power to reconvene Parliament prior to November 16, Dr. Costa said.

Only President has power to summon  Parliament - Senior Counsel Lalith Sepala Ratnayake
Senior Counsel Lalith Sepala Ratnayake yesterday said that the President has the power at any time while Parliament stands prorogued by a Proclamation to summon Parliament for an earlier date.
Rathnayake in a statement added that power to prorogue Parliament as well as the power to summon Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the proclamation proroguing Parliament is a power vested exclusively with the President of the Republic and no one else is Constitutionally empowered to exercise such powers.
The full statement: The Constitution of the Democratic Socialist Republic of Sri Lanka in Article 70 (1) gives the power to the President to summon, prorogue and dissolve Parliament. With regard to the power of the President to dissolve the Parliament, the proviso to Article 70 limits the power of the President, in that he cannot dissolve Parliament until the expiration of a period of not less than 4 years and 6 months from the date appointed for its first meeting, unless Parliament requests the President to do so by a resolution passed by not less than two thirds of the whole number of members (including those not present voting in its favour).
In Article 70 (3) of the Constitution states that a Proclamation proroguing Parliament shall fix a date for the next session not being more than two months after the date of Proclamation.
The President has the power at any time while Parliament stands prorogued by a Proclamation summon Parliament for an earlier date not being less than three days from the date of such Proclamation.
Therefore, unlike the powers of the President in dissolving Parliament there is no fetter under the provisions of the Constitution for the proroguing of Parliament. Except that it cannot be for a period of more than two months after the Proclamation.
In addition to the above stated Article which confers power to the President in Article 33 which deals with the duties, powers and functions of the President. In Article 33 (2) (c) also gives the power to the President to summon, prorogue and dissolve the Parliament.
Therefore, it is very clear that the power to prorogue the Parliament as well as the power to summon the Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the Proclamation proroguing Parliament is a power vested exclusively with the President of the Republic and no one else is constitutionally empowered to exercise such powers.
Even though the Constitution gives Parliament the power to (by resolution with a two third majority) request the President to dissolve Parliament before four and a half years, no such power is given to any other person under the Constitution to even make a request from the President to summon the Parliament before the date mentioned in the Proclamation as the date.
In view of the very clear provisions in the Constitution of the Republic it is very clear that neither Honourable Speaker nor Parliament could decide to advance the date stated in the Proclamation as the date for the next session.
Further, I would sate that no one could or should undermine the Constitution of the Republic being the Supreme Law of the country.

A total of 41,138 dengue cases and around 47 deaths have been reported from all parts of the country this year by October 30, the Epidemiology Unit sources said.
According to the sources, the highest number of dengue cases - 7,942 - was reported from the Colombo district while the second highest number - 4,463 - was reported from the Gampaha district. The third highest number of dengue cases - 4,356 - was reported from the Batticaloa district.
The Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) reported 1,998 dengue cases during the same period. The other parts of the Colombo district recorded 5,944 dengue cases. The total number of dengue cases reported from the Western Province is 14,925, the epidemiologists said.
Meanwhile, medical experts and consultants advise the public to seek medical treatment without delay for any type of fever without applying home remedies. All fever patients need rest and they should not attend work or school. All fever patients should take Paracetamol only. All other medications, especially Non-Steroidal Anti-Inflammatory Drugs (NSAID) such as Ibuprofen cause Dengue Hemorrhagic Fever (DHF) which can become fatal, they said.
People should keep their premises free of dengue mosquito breeding sites during the rainy season to prevent dengue. Even water retained in a pen clip or a bottle top is adequate for dengue mosquitoes to breed, they added.

The Prime Ministers Secretary S.Amarasekara stated that a complaint has been lodged with the Inspector General of Police against several persons who were allegedly threatened and assaulted state officers who had entered Temple Trees yesterday.
Amarasekara said that they have made a complaint regarding the incident to the Defence Ministry Secretary as well.
According to Amarasekara, these state officers who had served at Temple Trees have been transferred elsewhere and had arrived at Temple Trees premises to hand over their equipment when some persons stationed at the premises had allegedly threatened and assaulted them.
At present, Temple Trees is neither under the Prime Minister nor the government. For the last two days, officials who have worked at Temple Trees have been handing over their equipment and it was the same case today. When these officers had come to hand over their equipment, some outsiders who are stationed within the premises had attacked these officials. This is a serious offense. We need to get this issue solved in a peaceful and civil manner. It is wrong not to allow these officers to carry out their duties. It is wrong for outsiders to remain within the Temple Trees premises too. There are assets in this premises which run into millions of rupees. The subject officers are responsible for all these assets, Amarasekara pointed out.

Speaker doesnt have power to convene Parliament early - Former Speaker
Former Speaker Joseph Michael Perera yesterday said that the Speaker doesnt have power to convene Parliament, when it stands prorogued by the President.
He said that the Speaker doesnt have power to summon Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the Proclamation proroguing Parliament. Perera added President Maithripala Sirisena has issued a Gazzette Notification proroguing Parliament and the Speaker doesnt have the power to summon Parliament when it stands prorogued.
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga prorogued Parliament at that instance, I expressed my opinion and that can also be referred to, Perera said.
He added that he doesnt have any personal issues with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa. A Parliamentarian has been appointed to the post of Prime Minister, he said.
The President has prorogued Parliament and the Constitution is the supreme document of the people. There is no issue in appointing a member in a party which commands a majority. The government should protect the sovereignty and rights of the people.
However, the Speaker doesnt have the power to summon Parliament for an earlier date than the date fixed in the Proclamation proroguing Parliament.

Tax Cuts Galore!
The Ministry of Finance and Economic Affairs announced several important economic policy changes and initiatives today to provide relief to the masses and revive the economy.
Considering the high tax imposed on the Telecommunication services, the government has decided to reduce the Telecommunication Levy from 25% to 15%.
The statement said that the Special Commodity Levy will be reduced on Dhal by Rs. 5 per Kg, Chickpeas by Rs. 5 per Kg, Black gram by Rs. 25 per Kg.
Customs Duty will also be waived on Wheat grain to Rs. 9 per Kg from the existing waiver of Rs. 6 per Kg.
Sugar will be brought under the Special Commodity Levy (SCL) whereby the applicable taxes on Sugar will also be reduced by Rs.10 per Kg. Accordingly, the commodity prices will be reduced with immediate effect, the ministry said.
Meanwhile the price of Petrol (Octane 92) will be reduced by Rs. 10 per litre, Auto Diesel by Rs.7 per litre and Lubricants including the 2T lubricants used in three-wheelers and small agricultural engines is to be reduced by Rs.10 per litre with effect from midnight today (Nov. 1).
At the same time a cost based pricing mechanism will be implemented on fuel in place of the monthly fuel price formula, the statement said.
A guaranteed price scheme is to be introduced for Paddy, Onion and Potatoes produced locally by farmers.
Accordingly, SCL will be raised during harvesting period to protect farmers through remunerative guaranteed prices.
As potatoes and B-Onions are being harvested, SCL on potatoes and B-Onions will be maintained at Rs.40 per Kg.
In order to mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions which resulted in farmers losing their livelihood and becoming heavily indebted, interest and the penal interest incurred by farmers and small Paddy Mill owners on loans up to a maximum of Rs.50 million, from all Commercial Banks during the past 3 years, will be written off in full and will be borne by the Government.

Fertilizer prices for paddy will be maintained at Rs.500/50kg bag and fertilizer prices for other crops will be reduced to Rs. 1,000/50kg bag from Rs. 1,500/50kg bag.
The ministry said that the concessionary income tax rate of 14% on agriculture is presently applied only for the companies engaged in agricultural businesses.
The income of individuals from Agricultural undertakings will also be reduced from the existing maximum rate of 24% to 14% so that individual farming agriculture is also encouraged.
The concessionary Income Tax rate of 14% is presently applicable under the SME categories only for Companies. This rate will be extended to include individuals including those providing professional services. Therefore, the income tax rate for professional services will be reduced from 24 percent to 14 percent.
Withholding tax will be exempted on Interest on any savings and fixed deposits maintained in any financial institution.
To encourage local entrepreneurs, professionals and migrant workers to remit their earnings in foreign currency on services provided outside Sri Lanka, Income tax will be exempted on such remittances.

The threshold for the VAT liability of wholesale and retail sector also will be increased from Rs.50 million to Rs.100 million per twelve months providing benefits to small traders and businesses, the statement said.

Programme for Economic Revival
His Excellency the President, and the Honorable Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs have raised concerns regarding the serious setback in the economy as reflected in the persistently low growth rates during the last 3 years along with the rising cost of living. The Honorable Prime Minister is of the view that ill-conceived economic and financial policies of the previous Government have led to this situation by marginalizing local entrepreneurs, industries and domestic production.
As 2018/2019 Maha cultivation season has begun with extremely favorable weather throughout the country, the economy is set to get a new revival as all hydro power reservoirs and irrigated schemes have reached full storage capacity to generate electricity, provision of drinking water and water for cultivation. The Government thinks that this is the best opportunity to prepare the country to get the maximum benefit from agricultural production. At the same time the consumers are saddled with high cost of living. In this background the Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs has given direction to implement following initiatives to revive the economy.
In order to ease the pressure on high cost of living while also protecting the local farmer, Special Commodity Levy will be reduced on Dhal by Rs.5 per Kg, Chickpeas by Rs. 5 per Kg, Black gram by Rs.25 per Kg. Customs Duty will also be waived on Wheat grain to Rs. 9 per Kg from the existing waiver of Rs.6 per Kg. Sugar will be brought under the Special Commodity Levy whereby the applicable taxes on Sugar will also be reduced by Rs.10 per Kg. Accordingly, the commodity prices will be reduced with immediate effect.
Given the impact of fuel pricing on all strata of the society specially those engaged in transport, agriculture and fisheries sectors, price of Petrol (Octane 92) will be reduced by Rs. 10 per litre, Auto Diesel by Rs.7 per litre and Lubricants including the 2T lubricants used in three-wheelers and small agricultural engines by Rs.10 per litre with effect from mid night today. At the same time a cost based pricing mechanism will be implemented on fuel in place of the monthly fuel price formula.
A guaranteed price scheme will be introduced for Paddy, Onion and Potatoes produced locally by our farmers. Accordingly, SCL will be raised during harvesting period to protect farmers through remunerative guaranteed prices. As potatoes and B-Onions are being harvested, SCL on potatoes and B-Onions will be maintained at Rs.40 per Kg.
In order to mitigate the impact of adverse weather conditions which resulted in farmers losing their livelihood and becoming heavily indebted, interest and the penal interest incurred by farmers and small Paddy Mill owners on loans up to a maximum of Rs.50 million, from all Commercial Banks during the past 3 years, will be written off in full and will be borne by the Government.
The maximum threshold on Loan advances given by Samurdhi Banks to Samurdhi beneficiaries to support their livelihood activities will be increased by Rs.10,000/-.
Fertilizer prices for paddy will be maintained at Rs.500/50kg bag and fertilizer prices for other crops will be reduced to Rs. 1,000/50kg bag from Rs. 1,500/50kg bag.
The concessionary income tax rate of 14% on agriculture is presently applied only for the companies engaged in agricultural businesses. The income of individuals from Agricultural undertakings will also be reduced from the existing maximum rate of 24% to 14% so that individual farming agriculture is also encouraged.
The concessionary Income Tax rate of 14% is presently applicable under the SME categories only for Companies. This rate will be extended to include individuals including those providing professional services. Therefore, the income tax rate for professional services will be reduced from 24 percent to 14 percent.
Withholding tax will be exempted on Interest on any savings and fixed deposits maintained in any financial institution.
To encourage local entrepreneurs, professionals and migrant workers to remit their earnings in foreign currencyon services provided outside Sri Lanka, Income tax will be exempted on such remittances.
The adverse impact created by high indirect taxes will be mitigated by simplification of VAT and NBT. The VAT threshold will be increased from Rs.12 million per annum to Rs.24 million per annum.
The threshold for the VAT liability of wholesale and retail sector also will be increased from Rs.50 million to Rs.100 million per twelve months providing benefits to small traders and businesses.
The VAT rate applicable on the import of Sawn Timber will be reduced to 5% to support the local Construction Industry.
VAT on import of fabric will be exempt providing benefits to the small and medium garment manufacturers.
Considering the high tax imposed on the Telecommunication services, the Telecommunication Levy of 25% will be reduced to 15%.
The thrust if these initiatives are to encourage production and simplify the tax system. It will certainly help households with additional income in their hands. The proposed changes to the tax system will also encourage inward remittances and savings.
The Government also expects to reduce its expenditure with the rationalization of Cabinet ministries as reflected in a lessor number of ministries and reexamination of capital expenditure programs. Accordingly, the government is confident that the primary surplus of 1.8 percent of GDP and the budget deficit of around 4.9 percent of GDP that have been targeted for 2018 could be achieved in support for further fiscal consolidation to provide economic stability. The measures to further consolidation of external trade and payment transactions are also being examined to provide much needed stability to the exchange rate.
His Excellency the President and Honorable Prime Minister and Minister of Finance and Economic Affairs have directed the implantation of the above policy measures. The necessary Gazettes for the aforementioned tax related proposals will be issued today and Cabinet approval is sought to amend the necessary tax laws.
