300 plus is not difficult to get on this wicket  Roshen Silva
PALLEKELE, Friday  Sri Lankas first innings top scorer Roshen Silva said that chasing a target of 300 plus on the Pallekele International Stadium pitch was not impossible at the end of the third day of the second Test against England yesterday.
I think they've got a good score on the board and it's not impossible to get 300 plus. So we have to claim another wicket in the morning first, said Silva who made a composed 85 on the second day to give Sri Lanka an important 46-run lead on the first innings.
England in their second innings finished day three on 324-9 to lead overall by 278 with one wicket in hand.
Assessing the pitch Silva said, Actually, this is not the wicket we expected. We thought it would spin more. However, according to the way the batters batted yesterday and today and also considering the way we bowled, I dont think there was a big change during yesterday and today. Despite the fact that they scored over 300 runs, I dont think our three bowlers bowled that badly.
England batted well and we also bowled well too. I really dont know what will happen tomorrow. It may remain the same or may take a little more turn. There was an odd ball turning too much but basically, there was no such magical turn in the wicket.
It may be easy to play when the ball gets older. I will not say its going to be easy. But cricket is such an indefinite game.
We may get this total but it's not easy because, their three spinners are really good, said Silva.
Assessing the days play Silva said, Yes we had 46 runs lead but if you look at in the morning and the way Rory (Burns) and (Keaton) Jennings batted, they batted really well.
I think we didn't bowl badly on that wicket, but they played some good sweeps and reverse sweeps. Because of that, they got a lot of runs. England is one of the best teams that normally plays sweeps and reverse sweeps. They are really good in that.
Silva said that Joe Root the England captain who scored a century played positively and it paid off.
As soon as he came, he realized the situation and he took some risks and it paid off. Its risky to play those shots and you need courage to play them. It's a brilliant knock.
Commenting on the five-run penalty which England were awarded, Silva said, I was just standing near the crease thinking it was a boundary.
When Moeen (Ali) threw the ball in, all of a sudden Akila said Bunty Aiya run, run.
I wasn't sure whether I had creased or not but I ran.
Then the umpires came to me and said I had not creased. I apologized for my forgetfulness.
However, the umpire had a chat with the other umpire and explained to me about the law, despite the fact that I didn't do it deliberately. I was shocked when he awarded the penalty runs.

Be Guided by Compassion
Senior Vice President of Campaigns for PETA Asia Jason Baker speaks to the Daily News on their latest achievements and region-wide campaigns against animal rights violations.
PETA Asia is an affiliate of PETA-US, the worlds largest animal rights organisation.
Q: What are PETA Asias latest achievements with regard to animal welfare
A: We are achieving significant advances every day, and theyre all important achievements to furthering our cause. To list just a few recent achievements, they include: the Thailand Elephant Polo Association agreed to stop their annual Elephant Polo Tournament (an example we hope Sri Lanka will now follow); Malaysias Astro television channel agreed to cancel a Jallikattu (bull-chasing) competition; Okuchi no Umi Carnival in Seiyo, Japan, agreed to stop their annual pig rodeo event; many companies agreed to ban the use and sale of badger hair in makeup, shaving, and paint brushes; and authorities in Vietnam agreed to reject a plan to build a dolphinarium.
Q: In the Asian region, which country has the best and worst animal welfare
A: Its not so much about best and worst, and more about the progression of animal welfare as a concept within each country. This progression depends on a variety of factors, though, most importantly, cultural and socio-economic differences. By taking into account factors such as recognition of animal sentience, the importance of animal protection as a societal value, and the prohibition of cruelty to, and protection for, animals, it is possible to deduce, for example, that animal welfare is treated as a more important policy issue in somewhere like India, than it is in somewhere like Azerbaijan. This by no way means that animal welfare is not a problem in India, only that, as a matter of degree, there are some countries recognizing the concept of animal welfare more than others.
Q: Have you ever examined Sri Lankas animal welfare status What are your observations
A: As with all countries, there is much improvement required for animal welfare in Sri Lanka. The Animal Welfare Bill, which was submitted by Sri Lankas Law Commission in 2006, still hasnt been passed into law, and its now 2018. This is a great shame. The biggest challenge facing animal welfare as a concept is changing peoples mindsets through education, so they recognize the mistreatment of animals as wrong. One of the leading paths to such change is through enlightened government involvement, and if your government doesnt show that it values a given issue, it is then very difficult to convey the message to its citizens.
Q: In Asia the most commonly cited animal welfare violation cases include elephant captivity, animal slaughter for religious purposes using barbaric means, brutal methods of keeping/ slaughtering animals for food. What are your observations
A: The concept of animal welfare is, overall, newer in Asia, and therefore, has progressed less than it has in a continent like Europe. As with the countries within Asia, there are also differences between continents based on cultural and socio-economic factors. There are fewer laws in Asia which protect animals from cruelty and exploitation compared to other continents.
This means animal abusers rarely face diligent scrutiny, both under law, or by fellow citizens.
Q: A recent research study revealed that people have to move away from excessive meat eating to face climate change. Comment.
A: We now know that the largest contributor to climate change is animal agriculture. Other than causing animals tremendous suffering, raising animals for food requires enormous amounts of land, food, energy, and water. Significantly more greenhouse gas emissions are caused by animal agriculture than the combined transportation systems of all countries across the world. If we converted the land used for animal agriculture into crops, oxygen levels and the supply of water would rise significantly, causing carbon emissions, conversely, to fall dramatically.
Despite this fact, there remains a senseless, and seemingly determined focus by many world leaders, both in government and business, on transportation as the main issue, when animal agriculture is both a far larger contributor, and has a much easier solution. That solution is for people to change to a vegan lifestyle.
What makes this solution one which can be accomplished even more easily is that a vegan diet has been scientifically proven to be a lot better for your health. As such, vegan initiatives from world leaders would easily resonate with people. A vegan diet is both one vital for the survival of the planet, and one which is also a lot healthier. Whether someone eats animal products or not, is a simple choice, and we are hopeful people will choose based on whats more compassionate, rational, and responsible.
Q: Whats the situation of Mali, the elephant She is still being retained at the Manila zoo despite PETAs continuous efforts to free her.
A: Yes, unfortunately Mali is still in captivity at Manila Zoo. She has been kept in solitary confinement there for over 40 years. Her foot problems, which arent being treated, cause her constant pain and are potentially fatal. We have offered to transfer her to a sanctuary where she can live out her days in peace and comfort, all at no cost to the Philippine government. Negotiations with authorities are always ongoing.
Q: What are the recently reported cruel animal right violation cases in the Asian region
A: We see terrible abuse of animals in Asia, and in all continents, every day. As mentioned in response to an earlier question, the body of laws addressing animal welfare in countries across Asia is either non-existent, or severely underdeveloped. This means the existing problems within animal welfare are very widespread, and these, by consequence, give rise to more occurrences of gross misconduct towards animals.
Animals used for food and clothing are very often killed in horrific ways, without any anesthetic, and right in front of each other. Those in captivity for human entertainment, such as in zoos and circuses, often live in abhorrent conditions, in extremely unsanitary, and incredibly small cages and enclosures. Their human caretakers also usually show very little compassion, directing and controlling animals through force and fear alone.
Q: What are PETA Asias plans for year 2019
A: What we can tell you is that, as always, we will continue our unrelenting endeavour for the humane, ethical treatment of animals across all countries and industries in Asia. In addition, we will continue to promote the benefits of people adopting a plant-based (vegan) diet.

Case against six NFF party activists fixed for trial
The case against National Freedom Front Leader (NFF) Wimal Weerawansa and five other party activists for allegedly leading a protest blocking the main roads at Bauddhaloka Mawatha, causing disturbance to the people and the normal flow of traffic, were fixed for trial by Colombo Chief Magistrate Lanka Jayarathne.
The NFF staged the protest march against the visiting United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Raad Al Hussein On February 6, 2016.
Suspects pleaded not guilty.
On a previous occasion, the Cinnamon Gardens Police submitted an amended charge sheet on the six suspects before the Magistrate.
The Police said they were seeking to find any information regarding the seventh suspect.
The six suspects are NFF leader and Colombo District MP Wimal Weerawansa, Jayantha Samaraweera, Weerakumara Dissanayake, Piyasiri Wijenayake, Roger Seneviratne and Mohammed Muzammil.
Seventh accused Lalith Chaminda Jayalal did not appear before the Court yesterday.
Cinnamon Gardens Police informed the Magistrate that the suspects who organised the procession had failed to obtain prior permission from the Police to stage the march.
Police alleged that the organisers had used loudspeakers without a valid licence and submitted before the Court that the suspects provided leadership to a protest which blocked the main road at Bauddhaloka Mawatha towards Havelock Town, causing inconveniences to the people and the normal flow of traffic.

Caught on tape: the story behind Australian cricket's greatest fall
You know its serious when Mluleki Ntsabo isnt smiling. The South African Broadcasting Corporation commentator is small in stature and huge in energy, beaming a high-wattage grin as he booms away in English on the main mics or Xhosa on the update line. But as I walked into the broadcast area on the third afternoon of the Cape Town Test in March 2018, he came bouncing round the doorway behind me like a rubber ball, rebounding off the far wall, his face stern as he rushed along. Did you see he asked with urgency. Cameron Bancroft has something on the ball.
We piled into our commentary box where the ABC and SABC were running a joint broadcast. On the gantry outside our window were the three lead Supersport camera operators, adjusting and aiming their artillery-sized lenses, making fine calibrations beyond our understanding. They were chattering away on their walkie-talkies, coordinating with the other cameras all around the ground. There were close to 30 cameras overall, each with a part to play.
It was Bancroft they had followed first, tipped off to the possibility of shenanigans and tracking his every movement with or without the ball in hand. An hour or so later, they had the shot. Cricket lenses have 76 to 95 zoom, able to shoot from the grandstand to track a single bead of sweat running down a batsmans face. Through this extensive framing latitude, every dramatic on-site sensation can be captured, is how Canon describes it. Too true. Bancroft was holding the ball in his left hand, scrubbing his cupped right palm and fingers over the leather as though battling an unforgiving doorknob. You could see the pressure he was applying by the white flush of his knuckles. The fix was on.
But the broadcasters wanted more. Something explicit. What better way than to have the suspect provide it So they sat on the original footage for a few minutes, setting up the cameras. One for the coach, Darren Lehmann, watching from a Rapunzel window up in the team rooms. One for the reserve player, Peter Handscomb, surrounded by discarded pads and gloves down at the side of the field. Cameras on the captain, vice-captain, umpires, and half a dozen on Bancroft himself. Then the final ambush: just after Pat Cummins had finished a spell in the 42nd over, the original close-up of Bancrofts scrubbing hand flashed on to the grounds big screens.
The Australians poked their heads into the trap immediately. Lehmann made a radio call to Handscomb, who trotted on to the field and spoke to Bancroft. The young fieldsman, heart plunging through his shoes, already knew exactly what was going on. Meanwhile, third umpire Ian Gould was watching television monitors and jumping on his own walkie-talkie from up in the grandstand, prompting on-field umpires Richard Illingworth and Nigel Llong to wander over to each other for a chat. So Bancroft did what any kid shoplifting a Milky Way would do: he shoved the evidence down his pants.
Most apprentice petty thieves dont have quite the same battery of surveillance devices awaiting their every move. The initial footage was replaying as the umpires moved over to Bancroft. He produced the soft black bag for his sunglasses, claiming that was all he had in his pocket. Strictly speaking this was true. Sandpaper in the jocks, though, was about to cause more discomfort than the immediately physical.
The second lot of footage hit the screen: the long shot of Bancroft watching the umpires coming together, then turning his back to them. Cut to the close-up, and the super slow-motion capture of the waistband pop: this camera that usually depicts the vibrations in a cricket bat at the moment of impact, or the faintest twitch of glove on ball, was instead capturing 150 frames a second of a drawstring being tugged, frantically enough to turn the slow version into an incongruously extravagant flourish. A magicians fling of the hand, the cord springing out, two ends separating, then trailing, trailing, the smoke coils of downed aircraft. The magician in his haste proved to have no magic at all; not the slightest hint of sleight of hand in the way he took a bright yellow square from his pocket, thoroughly unpalmed, and pushed its incriminating colour into hiding.
It was a confession, signed unwittingly but indelibly. Yet, as obvious as it was, it was hard to believe. It was hard to believe it could have been so obvious.
There is a human tendency at events of significance to gather, to legitimise our experience together. We cant risk some spectacular misinterpretation; we look to others to confirm a city burning before our eyes. So commentators from every television and radio station crammed into the small break room in the broadcast centre. The previous morning its lone occupant had been Shane Warne, face down among some errant cables to take advantage of a break, snuffling awake with an imprint of the industrial grey carpet mottling one cheek. Today, though, everyone who wasnt on air was crowded in here: Shaun Pollock, Allan Border, Jim Maxwell, Kepler Wessels, Brendon Julian, arrayed around the widescreen television to watch the footage repeat and repeat.
There was no doubt or defence in the slow-motion ballet of elastic. As we watched, another shot was shown with even more detail. Bancrofts hand on the ball, close-up on his fingers. Index and middle knuckles parting for a second, for a millimetre, an aperture just enough for the cameras aperture to swoop through. A frozen flash of yellow proving beyond equivocation that his hidden treasure had been applied to the ball. Admittedly, it can seem absurd to imbue this action with such drama. But altering a ball can alter the course of a match, the worth of a legacy, the history of the game. This ball would alter some of the worlds most prominent careers.
Ball-tampering has always been a dark art. Bowling teams try to manage their sole weapon into its most dangerous state, but use methods retaining some vestige of deniability, or at least the mitigation of spontaneity. To use foreign objects brought on to the field for that purpose was something else. No Australian player had ever been charged with tampering, and now came a case that wasnt even marginal. This was proper cheating. To be caught so fully, so squarely, and looking so amateur in the attempt, just capped it off. And if we knew anything, it was that the least-experienced player in a team wouldnt develop that plan on behalf of 10 colleagues of his own accord. This story was going to be huge.
Back on the gantry, the cameramen were high-fiving each other at the sting. Supersports TV director leaned back in one of the hinged chairs set outside, swinging back and forth in contentment with his arms crossed and a toasty smile. Our guys did a very good job today, he said in his thick Afrikaans pronunciation, all plosives and alveolar trills. A very good job.
When the bust happened the match had been poised. South Africas star batsman AB de Villiers was at the crease. His team was 175 in front in their second innings, and two wickets down, but Australias pace leader Mitchell Starc had induced two collapses in the opening Test of the series with reverse swing.
The ball had just been thrown to Starc for a new spell, and was in the reverse-swing hotspot at 43 overs old. Once the subterfuge became bloody-obvious-fuge, the Australians had to suffer through another session of play. Faces were glum and minds distracted. Smith spent time off the field: who was he speaking to What did he know Was strategy afoot, or was he curled up in a toilet stall David Warner filled in as captain, calling a video review to dismiss Faf du Plessis.
Warner wouldnt be implicated that day but would be central later.
Handscomb filled in at slip, taking a catch. He had been implicated but would later be cleared. One other wicket fell, taking the total to five, the match slipping away by stumps with De Villiers still there and the lead at 294.
But the score was no longer a big factor in Australias glumness as they left the field. They knew the trouble that had been circling was coming in to land.
The standard radio and television interviews were denied, at least by their side. South Africas opener Aiden Markram, who had been batting with De Villiers when the trap was sprung, used his 23 years of age to play a very straight bat as I interviewed him for ABC: As a batter youre in your own zone and your own tunnel vision. I wasnt aware of it at all. I wasnt even aware of it as I got out. Ive not been exposed much to it. I havent played many first-class games, and havent played much Test cricket. Im still very young and naive in things like these, and I think it may be a blessing in disguise.
He took the same tack with the press conference that followed, speaking at length to a full room. But the room wanted the other teams young opener: Bancroft in his eighth Test.
The question was whether it might also be his last. Markram wrapped up and still there was no sign from Australia. There had been a message that someone would show. So we waited.
Twenty minutes, half an hour, three-quarters. From the full-length windows on the fourth floor of the North Stand, Cape Towns sky fell away into darkness, the seemingly immutable bulk of Table Mountain dissolving, the cricket ground vanishing until all that was left were our own reflections coming back at us in a blaze of light.
After nearly an hour there was movement on the far side of the ground. You had to stand up against the glass to see through the glare. Distant figures came down the steps, then on to the grass.
As they crossed the oval we could make out two white-clad forms, Bancroft and Smith still in their playing gear. On their right was the media manager, Kate Hutchison, hands in her jumper pockets as she hunched forward. On the left, the team manager, Gavin Dovey, in a grey suit.
Trailing him was the security manager, Frank Dimasi, his long peaked hood pulled over his head. Shoulders were rounded and feet slow. From outside, the press box windows high in the grandstand were glowing gold, but those approaching would have felt little warmth or welcome. - theguardian

CENTURY WILL BE SPECIAL ONE IF WE CAN WIN - ROOT
England captain Joe Root said that his century would be a special one if his team can go and win the second Test and with it the series.
It was very pleasing to make a big contribution on that pitch, said Root at the end of the day.
I certainly enjoyed myself today. There were a few filthy hacks in there at times but the way you have to think about batting the mental approach, different strategies against different bowlers makes it really good fun, said Root.
That's what it should be. You shouldnt feel pressure like the pressure is too much for you; you should enjoy the occasion and make the most of the opportunity in front of you.
We said we were going to play a certain manner in these conditions. I think the temptation with a deficit like that going into the second innings is to play within your shell and be a bit insular but the guys went out and set the tone at top of the order.
It was really pleasing to see inexperienced guys as Test cricketers really set the benchmark for the rest of the group, a really good platform for us.
Guys have not been shy of experimenting. Trying to develop themselves and with that it gives the team a better opportunity to score on a wide range of circumstances.
Even when we lost wickets in a cluster we still managed to score at 4.5/5 an over at times. Felt at no point were we under real big amounts of pressure, we were exerting it back on to them. Hopefully we can still stretch the lead further and that should be a good chase on this surface.

Today that court is not in use. Schools like Trinity, Girls High School and Hillwood were involved in a big way at one time.
But sad to say today this sport has more or less lost its identity. Today at Garden Club only private coaching is taking place.

Federer cruises past Anderson to reach last four at ATP Finals
London,Thursday: Roger Federer gained sweet revenge over Kevin Anderson at the ATP Finals on Thursday but is putting thoughts of his 100th title to the back of his mind after both players reached the last four.
The Swiss broke the giant South Africans serve four times in a comprehensive 6-4, 6-3 victory at Londons O2 Arena even though Anderson had not faced a single break point in his two earlier round-robin victories.
Second seed Federer suffered a painful loss at the hands of Anderson in the Wimbledon quarter-finals this year after leading by two sets, his only defeat against him in five meetings before Thursdays clash.
The six-time champion started the week with an uncharacteristically ragged display in a straight-sets defeat by Kei Nishikori but has beaten Dominic Thiem and Anderson in straight sets and is looking more like his old self as the tournament progresses.
The victory over fourth-seed Anderson in the Lleyton Hewitt Group takes Federer through to the semi-finals for the 15th time in 16 attempts at the season-ending finale and means he will likely avoid a meeting in the last four against in-form Novak Djokovic.
Im happy that this is another week like this, said Federer. Didnt look like it maybe 72 hours ago. But I was able to come back and play good tennis.
Personally Im still not thinking of the number 100. I wont let that get in my head, make me go crazy because it should be something Im excited about and not something I should feel extra pressure.
As long as I think Novak is in the draw anyhow, hes playing so good again, its never going to be easy.
The first set was a topsy-turvy affair, with both players quickly into their groove on serve before a succession of breaks.
Federer, buoyed by his customary vocal support, broke to lead 4-3, only to lose his momentum immediately as Anderson levelled.
The Swiss broke the South African in the next game, sealing the break with a crisp backhand volley at the net but was immediately in trouble at 0-40 on his own serve before winning five successive points to take the set.
The second set went with serve until the seventh game, when Federer produced an immaculate sliced backhand that landed on the line to earn a break.
Now playing with freedom, the 37-year-old broke again to seal the victory and guarantee that he tops the group.
Earlier, Dominic Thiem beat Nishikori 6-1, 6-4 but both players will exit at the round-robin stage.
Top seed Djokovic is already through to the semi-finals after beating Alexander Zverev in the Guga Kuerten Group on Wednesday, with Zverev, Marin Cilic and John Isner battling for the other semi-final berth.
The world number one, aiming for a sixth ATP Finals title to pull level with Federer, plays Cilic on Friday while Zverev takes on Isner. AFP

Five knocks that severely affected the bowlers career
The cricketing world is replete with instances of batsmen mercilessly marauding the hapless bowlers throughout the park. In the process, cases of those devastating innings adversely impacting the career prospects of bowlers are also not that few.
Several bowlers had to pay dearly for being at the receiving end of the willow brandishing monsters.
In this endeavour, we take a look at five of the most famous innings, which virtually resulted in the end of a bowlers career.
1. SANATH JAYASURIYA ENDS MANOJ PRABHAKARS CAREER
The World Cup 1996 was highly anticipated to be Indias chance to reach the pinnacle again post the 1983 triumph. But, with India being slotted along with Sri Lanka, Australia and West Indies in Group A, going was tough in the group stages. After victories against Kenya and West indies and a narrow loss against mighty Aussies, a confident India elected to bat first in the encounter against Sri Lanka, the dark horse of the tournament.
Riding on Sachins fabulous 137 and Azhars wristy stroke filled 72, India went on to compile 271/3 in their stipulated 50 overs, a match winning score those days.
In reply, Sri Lanka was off to a rollicking start, with Jayasuriya and Kaluwitharana hitting shots all over the park with disdain. Jayasuriya was particularly in his imperious best, hitting his favorite square cuts and pulls at will.
He was absolutely brutal on Manoj Prabhakar, senior India paceman. Such was the ruthlessness of the attack that Azhar was forced to cut short his first spell to 2 overs only. In the return spell too Sri Lanka scored 20 odd off his 2 overs. His final figures read 47/0 in 4 overs.
In the process, the platform was already set for a massive Sri Lankan win. With Ranatunga and Tillakaratne completing the formalities, Sri Lanka went to script a memorable win. The match is also remembered as the last one in the illustrious career of Prabhakar. Such ignominious was the assault on the allrounder that he could never really stake a claim in the Indian Team again.

2. SEHWAG PULLS DOWN CURTAINS ON SAQLAINS CAREER
Pakistan-India series of 2004 was highly anticipated as Pakistan was hosting India for the first time in 15 years. It was important from the diplomatic angle too, as massive efforts were on to foment better relations between the arch rivals.
India had won the ODI series 3-2 and were firm favorites to win the Test series too. The face-off in the longer version kicked off in Multan. India won the toss and elected to bat first.
Indians were off to a sterling start, with Sehwag belting all the bowlers, sparing none. He was particularly merciless on Saqlain, the wily off-spinner. Sehwag went to score a mammoth 309, the first triple century by an Indian in Tests. In the process he also ensured Saqlain was forced to record the worst figures in his Test career. His final figures read 43-4-204-1.
Indians were successful in bowling out Pakistan cheaply in both the innings, thereby scripting a historic win against the old foes. Sehwag was aptly announced as the Man of the Match. Ironically it turned out to be the last Test match of Saqlain, an ill-deserved end to an illustrious career.

3. BRENDON MCCULLUM COMPOSES AJANTA MENDIS SWANSONG
The New Zealand-Sri Lanka ODI series of 2015 was a highly one sided match-up. Sri Lanka was well past it halcyon days and Kiwis were always an indomitable one-day side at home. Hence expectations were limited even from hard core Sinhalese fans.
In the first ODI at Christchurch, Sri Lanka won the toss and elected to bat first. But living up to expectations, Lankans were never allowed to score freely.
Sri Lankas batting lineup fell like a pack of cards at the hands of the Kiwi pace attack. With the tail wagging for the Emerald Islanders, Sri Lanka were able to post a respectable 188 in 47 overs.
In reply, New Zealand openers never lifted the foot off the game. Lankan bowlers were left panting with 100 runs coming off the first 10 overs. The attack on Ajanta Mendis was particularly mind blowing. McCullum and Guptill piled on a massive 49 runs off 5 overs of the mystery spinner.
Kiwis breezed through the innings with no hiccups. The target of 188 was reached in just 21 overs. Matt Henry was aptly named the Man of the Match.
The match is also remembered as the last one of Ajantha Mendis. His career lost steam post the McCullum attack at Christchurch. He never donned the Lankan colours again.

4. LARA PUTS BRAKES ON BUDDING CAREER OF RJ PETERSON
In December 2003, West indies toured South Africa, with the hopes of healing the wounds inflicted in the previous series. But with a batting line up largely dependent on Lara for the reversal in fortunes and a relatively inexperienced batting line up, chances of a Caribbean victory over Proteas was highly unlikely.
Batting first on a belter, South Africa compiled 561 in the first essay, largely thanks to the tons from Smith and Kallis. In reply, West Indies too had a solid start with Darren Ganga compiling a carefully made fifty. The contest took a real turn when Robin Peterson was introduced into the attack, which resulted in Lara turning on his absolute beast mode.
Lara gave vent to his complete wrath in Petersons 6th over and scored 28 runs. The bowler was never able to completely recover from the blitzkrieg by Lara and he ended up with figures of 13-2-76-0.
Though Lara scored a double ton, South Africa was able to blow away West Indies hopes of a victory pretty effortlessly. In the end, Proteas won the match by 189 runs. The match also put brakes on the prospects of Peterson grooming into the next best spinner for South Africa after Adams. Peterson hardly played 10 Tests post that over a decade, and his start-stop career never took off.

Test matches played after the knock:10 (Over 14 years)
5. GAYLE DEMOLISHES P PARAMESWARANS LOFTY DREAMS
The fourth edition of the Indian Premier League was unique for many reasons- increase in the number of teams, overall increase in the number of matches and new rules for player transfers. There was another shocking record made during the tournament- a batsman scoring 37 runs off a single over.
In the 50th match of the tournament, Kochi Tuskers won the toss against RCB and elected to bat first. But things didnt go according to the plan and they could only cobble up 125 in the stipulated 20 overs. There were only 4 two digit scores in the entire innings.
In reply, Royal Challengers were off to a flying start, with openers, Gayle and Dilshan firing on all cylinders. The real drama unraveled as early as the 3rd over itself, with the lanky Kerala seamer, Parameswaran getting introduced into the attack. Gayle never lifted the foot off the accelerator and that over read - 6, 6(nb), 4, 4, 6, 6, 4 - a whopping 37 runs in an over.
RCB was able to blow away the Tuskers total in mere 13 overs, largely due to the early pyrotechnics from Dilshan and Gayle.
The latter scored 44 off 16 deliveries. Parameswaran, then a highly promising paceman, was never really able to recover from the ruthless assault by Gayle.
His IPL dreams were literally nipped in the bud, with no major takers for him in the ensuing editions. Even in first class circuit, his performance took a dip and he faded into oblivion by 2015.

An impetus for development
Development must essentially be a continuous process that is not impacted by changes in the political landscape. There has been a tendency in this country to stop the development projects of the previous Government solely on political grounds and even out of spite. For example, the previous Government elected in January 2015 put on hold many projects including the Port City project. Fortunately, sanity prevailed and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe even became its biggest proponent, espousing its benefits in many foreign capitals.
President Maithripala Sirisena has made it clear that all development projects initiated in the last few years must go ahead without any interruption. In fact, even amidst the fast-changing political developments in Colombo, he took time out to personally supervise several development and welfare projects. This is indeed a praiseworthy move.
Being an emerging economy, Sri Lanka has limited domestic funds for development. This is where our international partners come into the picture. Many friendly countries including India, China, Japan, UK, USA and EU nations have been assisting our development projects. One of the prime areas for foreign investment is the transport sector comprising roads and railways. We reported yesterday that the extension of the Southern Expressway to Mattala is nearing completion while the extension of the Southern railway line to Kataragama is also literally on track for completion by the target date.
The railways have the potential to be a much bigger player in the passenger and goods transport sector. But Modernisation is essential for this to happen. This will receive a boost next week when the Indian Railways exports the first state-of-the-art Diesel Multiple Units (DEMU) train rakes to Sri Lanka.
The first rake is part of an export order of six rakes of DEMU to Sri Lanka. As part of the order, Integral Coach Factory Chennai will manufacture six DEMU rakes consisting of 78 coaches in five variants. The order is being jointly executed by the Indian Rail Company RITES and ICF under an India-Sri Lanka economic cooperation agreement.
There will be three different types of coaches -- AC Executive Class, Second and Third Class - and, as per the Sri Lanka Railways requirement, they will only have seating facility. The DEMU rake is powered by a 1,800 HP onboard engine and has a newly-designed stainless steel aerodynamic front end to reduce drag at high speeds.
There are many first time features in the new DEMU coaches to make it contemporary and on par with Metro trains. The new features include plush interiors, a GPS-based passenger information system in all coaches, halogen-free rubber flooring, individually revolving seats, facility for driver announcements and individual audio controls for AC class passengers. Many of these features will be seen in our railway system for the first time.
Each DEMU rake consists of 13 cars in a combination of two driving power cars with economy class seating, two driving trailer cars with economy class seating, two air-conditioned chair cars with rotatable seats, two business class chair cars and five economy class coaches. The AC first class coach can accommodate 52 passengers, the economy car can accommodate 90 and the Business class coach has a capacity of 64 passengers.
Sri Lankan and Indian Railway engineers working on the project have addressed another concern  corrosion of exterior parts. Since Sri Lanka has large portions of rail lines along coastal areas, rail coaches are prone to corrosion. Thus the car body along with all interior fittings has been made of authentic stainless steel and special paint has been used on the coaches and under-frame to prevent corrosion. The body will be painted with special high class anti-graffiti paint that will be appealing and long lasting.
This latest addition to the Sri Lanka Railway will no doubt help attract more passengers especially on long distance routes such as Matara, Anuradhapura, Jaffna, Batticaloa and Trincomalee. The train is a much more comfortable and less time consuming alternative to the AC buses and many car owners are also likely to take the train given the multitude of comforts available in the new compartments. The plush new trains should be heavily promoted at least in the initial stages to attract more passengers including foreign tourists.
The authorities must also move ahead with two other railway projects  the electrification of parts of the main line (say, from Aluthgama to Polgahawela) and the seven-line Light Rail Transit (LRT) project in Colombo and main suburbs. Both projects have the potential to be game changers in the transport industry. We have been talking about electrification from 1948 itself, with nothing actually happening. This time, words must be translated into action.
The LRT will perhaps be the biggest transport project ever to be undertaken in Sri Lanka, with the first line from Malabe to Colombo due to begin construction in 2020. This has the potential to drastically reduce traffic congestion in and around Colombo, as many car owners are likely to hop on board the LRT, which can reduce commuting times by at least one hour. We must reap the maximum benefits of the coming railway revolution.

Masses urge political parties to end chaos
Legal luminaries, prominent members of the Maha Sangha, Hindu and Muslim clergy, leaders of social organizations, intellectuals and various societal reference groups, yesterday blamed MPs for not realizing sovereignty of the people and holding an election as soon as possible to exercise that sovereignty at this critical juncture of political unrest in the country.
Members of the clergy said the government should come from the people, by the people and for the people, and not by voice votes of an unruly House where the Speaker, instead of acting on the basis of the Constitution and Standing Orders in Parliament, is acting to the interest of a political party that he is a part of.
A top legal luminary said the alarming levels of present day violence in Parliament are the result of the Speaker defying and interpreting the Presidential decrees. He was in no position and it was not his duty or prerogative to challenge or interpret the Presidents powers to appoint a Prime Minister and a Cabinet.
Asked about the recent interim order issued by the Supreme Court suspending the Presidents gazette to dissolve Parliament, he said he prefers to keep away from it prematurely because the case concerned has not been concluded yet.
We asked a legal expert if the Interim Order in focus did not give rise to chaos in Parliament. He said, This is what Supreme Court had to do when they saw a sign of a case to be heard. It does not implicate that the dissolution of Parliament was unlawful.
Had the Speaker adjourned Parliament until the Supreme Court gives its final determination about it as per dates fixed for the case hearings, so much trouble could have been avoided, he said.
On being pointed out that the UNP were saying they have the majority to remain in power, he said,  It was misleading to say so because it is the UNP, the JVP and the TNA put together.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayaka yesterday said at a TV political interview, that the UNP leadership has paid millions of dollars to some Parliamentarians not to cross over to the Maithripala - Mahinda Rajapaksa government.
In this context one could say that the sovereignty of the people is hardly represented in Sri Lankan Parliament as at present, he said.
It is the duty of the UNP to come forward and support holding an election because that way they can prove their worth before the public, than before a partisan Speaker, he added.

The members of Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) yesterday appeared before the Court of Appeal to show cause why they should not be punished for contempt of Court for their failure to register a student of the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine Limited (SAITM) in Malabe in terms of the Court of Appeal judgment.
The matter was fixed for November 30 and the members of SLMC were advised to appear in Court on next hearing date. The Court of Appeal bench comprised Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Arjuna Obeysekara.
Filing a contempt of court action against the SLMC, petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a MBBS graduate of the SAITM, moved court that the members of the SLMC be charged for committing the offences of contempt of court by willfully and contumaciously failing to provisionally register petitioner as a medical practitioner in terms of section 29(2) of the Medical Ordinance and thereby disobeying the order of Court of Appeal dated January 31, 2017.
The petitioner stated that to date the SLMC and its members have failed, neglected and refused to comply with the judgment of Court of Appeal which was affirmed by the Supreme Court and provisionally register her as a medical practitioner. On September 21, the Supreme Court upheld the Court of Appeal judgment dated January 31, 2017 regarding a legal issue pertaining to the SAITM and ordered the SLMC to pay Rs.100,000 as legal cost to a petitioner Dhilmi Kasunda Suriyarachchi, a student of SAITM in Malabe, for unnecessarily delaying and refusing to register her as a medical practitioner.
Presidents Counsel Romesh de Silva with counsel Sugath Caldera, Shanaka Cooray and Niran Ankatel appeared for the petitioner. President's Counsel Manohara de Silva along with Gamini Marapana PC appeared for the respondents.

MPs agitate against  the Speaker
Parliament marked the lowest point in its entire history yesterday with a series of violent assaults, bloodshed, and rancorous behaviour of some MPs which led to mayhem in the House.
The MPs were conducting a mock sitting with MP Arundika Fernando in the Speakers Chair flanked by fellow MPs when the quorum bell rang at 1.30 pm to commence sittings.
Ministers Pavithra Wanniarachchi and Dilan Perera were leading slogans which demanded the immediate arrest of UNP MP Palitha Thewarapperuma for sneaking in a knife and UNP MP Ranjan Ramanayake for grabbing it and keeping it with him.
MP Susantha Punchinilame was seen seated on the Secretary Generals chair and video recording the scene. The MPs, who flocked near the Speakers Chair, shouted slogans which said Palithaya pihi genawa,
Gon-Ranja pihi genawa, Pihikaraya remand karau, Karuwalayata enna kiyapiya, mewata uttara denna kiyapiya, berinam daala yanna kiyapiya and Oka tamai api kiwwe-mehema karala be kiwwe.
Several representatives of the diplomatic missions were present in the gallery witnessing the entire episode while many electronic media channels brought in cameras to the gallery to provide live coverage. Instead of water bottles, the MPs were only provided with plastic cups of water yesterday. All individuals entering the Parliament complex were thoroughly scanned by the STF.
As the quorum bell went off at 1.30pm, the UNF, TNA and JVP MPs filed into the Chamber and took their seats in the Opposition. Secretary-General Dhammika Dasanayake, his Deputy and Assistant also took their seats. UNP MPs Palitha Thewarapperuma and Ranjan Ramanayake were also seen seated.
The quorum bell rang for the second time at 1.40 pm and again at 1.50pm for the third time, but the mock sitting continued. The MPs then started making speeches near the Speakers Chair. Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara, who spoke first, said arresting the criminal who brought in a knife to the Chamber was a pre-condition of theirs to let the sittings commence.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa, making a speech near the Speakers Chair, said they do not accept Karu Jayasuriya as the Speaker. He said the MPs security inside the Chamber must be assured. He called on the people to wage a battle for democracy in the streets. The Governments are elected by the people of this country and not by foreign countries. Let the people decide at a General Election. I urge the Supreme Court to take the correct decision thinking of the future stability of the country, he said.
Ministers Pavithra Wanniarachchi, Bandula Gunawardena and Mahindananda Aluthgamage also made speeches. Aluthgamage spoke in Tamil. Fernando, who was presiding the mock sitting, also called on the names of MPs Lakshman Kiriella and Anura Kumara stating that they could be given the floor for 10 minutes. MP Prasanna Ranaweera was seen guarding the closed door near the Speakers Chair which the Speaker usually uses to enter the Chamber.
The quorum bell sounded for the fourth time at 2.05pm. At 2.20pm, a side door to the Chamber opened and a large number of unarmed Parliament police personnel entered in a human chain guarding Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and Serjeant-at-Arms Narendra Fernando who carried the Mace.
MPs had removed the Speakers Chair by then.
The first police officer who entered carried an extra chair for the Speaker and tried to move in the direction of the Speakers Chair. The furious MPs started reacting violently at this point.
Minister Wimal Weerawansa grabbed the Chair from the Police officer and Minister Johnston Fernando broke it into pieces. Fernando then threw the pieces back in the direction of the Speaker. The pieces hit Parliament Police.
Parliament staff assistants and police held cushion covers of the chairs to protect the Speaker. The Speaker took a seat usually allocated for Parliamentary staff assistants near the Opposition benches with a hand-held microphone. The MPs then hurled bound books at the direction of the Speaker and Police. Later they threw more such books and water mixed with chillie powder to the direction of Opposition MPs and police.
The Speaker then commenced the sittings officially and Standing Orders were suspended by majority vote. Since the Speaker spoke to the microphone, the Hansard could record what he said. All opposition MPs, who were in their seats, supported the Speaker to carry on the proceedings. The No-Confidence Motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa was placed before the House again after deleting the first Clause as agreed at the meeting with President Maithripala Sirisena on Thursday night.
The Speaker asked all MPs to support to go for a vote by name, but since the MPs did not heed him, he took a voice vote. All Opposition MPs sat from their seats, raised their hands and said aye. The Speaker then announced the House that the Ayes have it and that the motion was carried while the UNF MPs cheered and applauded. The Speaker then adjourned the session till November 19.
While the MPs hurled books, shoes and any other item that they could reach, the political party supporters in the public gallery began shouting at the MPs. JVP MP Vijitha Herath and several Parliament police personnel sustained injuries. MPs Vijitha Herath and Gamini Jayawickrema Perera also came under the attack of water mixed with chillie powder. The thick bound book hit several Opposition MPs including Malik Samarawickrema. UNP MP Harin Fernando and several UNP MPs hurled the same big books thrown at them back in the direction of the UPFA MPs. The podium, on which the Mace is kept, fell on the floor due to the roar of the MPs.
PM Mahinda Rajapaksa, who made a brief presence in the House, walked out of the chamber. Former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe also made a brief presence.

NCCSL wants all parties to act with restraint
he October ordeal which plunged our country into a political crisis has now with the intervention of the Supreme Court brought about a glimmer of hope and light, creating necessary breathing space in the given time for the Legislature (Parliament) and the Executive, elected by the peoples franchise to resolve the deadlock and address the issues of the nation
The National Christian Council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) whilst acknowledging that our country is facing a crucial test in her history welcomes the move of the Judiciary for collective responsibility on the part of the Legislature. We call upon all political parties represented in Parliament to put aside their political and ideological differences, refrain from personal agendas and work together for the welfare of all people whom they represent.
Act with transparency and foresight to gain the confidence and acceptance of the people, rejecting undemocratic procedures, abuse of power, and manipulations of bribery, corruption and intimidation.
Be mindful of the prevailing political instability which could lead to severe economic crisis resulting in an erosion of investor confidence, business environment and its telling effect on the day to day lives of the people.
Adopt a approach towards a reconciliatory government represented by all parties in the parliament to genuinely address the grave issues of cost of living, debt service, development, ethnic and religious cooperation and harmony till the end of the term of parliament and ensure that subsequent elections are called in time.
We also call upon all religious leadership to step in at this crucial time to assert their role as spiritual guides, giving rightful direction to both their flock and the political leadership, mindful of their respective hallowed teachings with sincerity and truth.
We request the media to act with restrain and responsibility without seeking business or political gain or advantage and for civil society to boldly stand for justice.
We also call upon the public to maintain a moderate behavior at this crucial time respecting the law and order of the country without falling into any kind of inducement or favour.
As a religious entity, The National Christian council of Sri Lanka (NCCSL) is genuinely concerned at the present turn of events, assures the nation of its prayers and fullest support for the maintenance of law, order and sanity in the affairs of the people and stands fully committed towards this goal at all times.

New Zealand gain consolation win over Pakistan
New Zealand, after losing to India and Australia, finally got on the points table with a solid 54-run win over Pakistan in the ICC Womens World T20 2018.
Sophie Devine returned to a more familiar spot at the top of the batting order, and scored 32 in 31 balls, Suzie Bates added 35 in 31, Amy Satterthwaite and Katey Martin chipped in with 20s, and New Zealand put up 144/6.
It wasnt a daunting target, but none of the Pakistan batters apart from Javeria Khan (36 in 23) really got going as Amelia Kerr returned 3/21 and Player of the Match Jess Watkin 3/9.
With Australia and India winning all three of their games so far, New Zealands run in the tournament is over.
For Pakistan, captaincy is certainly working out well for Javeria, who had also hit 74* in the game against Ireland, the only one Pakistan have won. This one didnt go too well, like the ones against India and Australia.
We were not this clinical with our bowling. We were good in patches, and throughout the match we didnt field well. It was a good toss to win.
We should have restricted them under 110 to 115 because the pitch wasnt offering much pace, summed up Javeria.
The bowling wasnt at its best, and the fielding was well below par  two catches were dropped in the 13th over, for example.
It has been a decent performance on the whole for Pakistan, with Javeria, Bismah Maroof and Nida Dar scoring half-centuries at different points, and the bowlers mostly holding their own. Ill be positive. The kind of cricket these girls have played  they have played better cricket throughout the World T20. We made mistakes, but well grow as a unit with more matches we get, said Javeria.
Pakistan wont go further in the tournament, but have seen two of the top teams from up close: Australia and India. On the evidence in front of her, Javerias clear on who the tournament favourites are: Australia, by far.
Scores:
New Zealand Women 144-6 in 20 overs (Sophie Devine 32, Suzie Bates 35, Amy Sattethwaite 26, Katey Martin 29, Sana Mir 2/36, Aliya Riaz 2/29)
Pakistan Women 90 in 18 overs (Javeria Khan 36, Amelia Kerr 3/21, Jess Watkin 3/9)

Parliament
During No Confidence Motion: Sampanthan regrets non use of electronic voting system
Leader of the Opposition TNA Leader R. Sampanthan addressing the media in Parliament yesterday, said that it was very unfortunately that the electronic voting system could not be used nor could members be called by name at the vote taken during the No Confidence Motion on Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa in Parliament yesterday, due to the conduct of some parliamentarians who supported Mahinda Rajapaksa.
The drama commenced on October 26, when Mahinda Rajapaksa was appointed the Prime Minister by President Maithripala Sirisena presumably on the basis that the President believed that Rajapaksa had the majority in Parliament. It was the duty of Mahinda Rajapaksa to attend Parliament without delay and prove his majority through a vote in Parliament which he failed to do. On the contrary, he and his supporters engaged in bribing members of Parliament portfolios and Deputy portfolios with money. This was a matter of public knowledge which was not a secret. Despite all his efforts, he was still not able to muster a majority and get the much needed 113 members in a 225 member Parliament to prove he had a majority, he added.
Consequently, he said that the parties opposing him and who knew he did not have a majority in Parliament decided to move a No Confidence resolution against him and his government in Parliament. That resolution was moved and passed in Parliament on November 14. The resolution was adopted on a voice vote. 122 members of Parliament signed a written statement stating that they had no confidence in Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister or in his government. Subsequently, Parliament met again on November 15 and Rajapaksa made a statement and at the end of the statement, a resolution was moved rejecting the statement and reaffirming that Parliament had no confidence in him. This resolution was adopted by voice vote and passed.
However, Sampanthan noted that there were some views being raised about a voice vote and it was decided that when Parliament met yesterday, that a resolution would be moved stating that Parliament had no confidence in Mahinda Rajapaksa or his government and that a vote would be adopted either through the electronic voting system or by the calling of names, to ensure that everything was done in a way beyond question.
But yesterday, they prevented the Speaker taking his seat in Parliament. They surrounded the Speakers chair and one member shamefully sat on the Speakers chair with others around him, shouting slogans and preventing the Speaker from taking his seat. However, the Speaker did arrive, though delayed, with Police protection and conducted the proceedings of Parliament pertaining to that resolution, he said, adding that the Standing Orders were suspended and the resolution moved and once again adopted by a voice vote.
Speaker should take responsibility for chaos
The Speaker should take the blame and responsibility for the unrest which took place in Parliament yesterday, said Minister Keheliya Rambukwella, addressing the media at Parliament yesterday. The UPFA/SLFP held a media briefing at the Parliament Committee room after the unfortunate brawl which erupted at the Chamber. They said despite several of the senior SLFP members meeting Speaker Karu Jayasuriya earlier around 11.30 yesterday and requesting him to take the vote on a latter date, he went ahead with it knowing very well what the outcome would be.
They said that two UNP MPs had brought knives into the Chamber on Thursday and the UPFA MPs had demanded that action be taken against them. The SLFP members pointed out that despite claims by the IGP to investigate the incident and take action, it was the Speaker who should facilitate such action when such incidents take place within Parliament chambers.
Minister Susil Premajayantha alleged that resolutions were being passed one after the other without following proper Parliamentary procedures, accusing the Speaker of acting entirely in favour of the UNP. There is a proper way of getting such resolutions passed by establishing proper procedures. It was clearly shown that two of the UNP MPs had knives in their hand and it was the Speaker who should have complained to the Police. Otherwise, the Parliament police would not accept complaints. The Speaker is responsible for what happens in Parliament. But the Speaker was not interested in discussing the matter with the President and taking a suitable course of action. He was hell bent on repeating the same thing he did earlier and have this NCM passed against Prime Minister Rajapaksa. He got down the International media and filled the gallery with UNP thugs and did what his party wanted him to do.
He pointed out that no one could enter Parliament without the permission of the Speaker, while yesterday, the viewing gallery was filled with UNP supporters who were shouting slogans and creating a rumpus. How did they come there We never allowed anyone to come. There were hundreds of UNP thugs who were their supporters allowed into the public gallery and saw them throwing objects at us from upstairs. Before the Speakers arrival, the UPFA/SLFP members were demanding that knife wielding MPs be taken into custody.
He noted that the Speaker had then entered the Chamber surrounded by a battalion of Police officers without their badges. This is also illegal.
Permitting thugs to enter Parliament: Speaker has tarnished reputation of House
The Speaker has created a huge issue between the executive and the legislative, said former Speaker Chamal Rajapaksa. The Speaker came to Parliament yesterday, surrounded by a large group of police personnel. This is very ugly. If the Speaker was unable to attend Parliament without a Police escort, then there is no democracy. Under these circumstances, we cannot continue to respect the Speaker of this Parliament. Similarly, we cannot allow Parliamentary proceedings to continue either. We could only render him our cooperation in carrying out parliamentary operations only if he is impartial. But when he takes sides and acts in a biased manner, we cannot cooperate with him. When we met the Speaker, we told him to delay Parliament as both sides were agitated, but he did not heed our warning and went ahead with his plan. The Speaker has tarnished the reputation of Parliament by allowing thugs to come into Parliament. In such a volatile situation, they should never have allowed outsiders to enter Parliament. But they deliberately did so and the Speaker facilitated it.
Accusing the Speaker of having approved UNP thugs to come into Parliament yesterday, the UPFA called on Parliamentary authorities to release the list of names of the civilians who were allowed into the viewing gallery during yesterdays Parliamentary sessions. They said they were thugs brought by the UNP. The UPFA said that the UNP is trying to cling onto power with the assistance of foreign diplomats.
Meanwhile, joining the press briefing Minister Vasudeva Nanayakkara noted that due to the assassination plot, President Maithripala Sirisena and Mahinda Rajapaksa had to unite. This is a Kangaroo Parliament and the only solution is to go for a General Election. Under the current volatile situation, that is the only option. Why is the UNP so afraid of going for an election It is because they know they could not win, while the Speaker is behaving in this manner to safeguard the position of the UNP.
When we met the Party leaders earlier, Patali Champika and Rajitha Senaratne behaved in an arrogant and confrontational manner, retorting that we had no business being in the government. Under these circumstances, we knew that there was no purpose in having this vote today. We did not act provocatively yesterday, it was rightful resistance to an illegal procedure and improper resolution inside Parliament. When you dont follow a procedure it becomes a nullity. You cant allow a nullity to be given the ceremonial sanctity of Parliament.
Therefore, the members said we are in danger of our lives with knife wielding members of the Opposition and asked that action be taken against them. We said, until you take action against them there would be no meeting of Parliament, he said.
PM Rajapaksa kept silent, while MPs behaved in unruly manner:JVP
The Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP), while blaming Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa for the unrest created in Parliament yesterday (16), said he should take responsibility for the violence that triggered at the Parliament Chamber.
Addressing a media briefing after the unfortunate brawl that erupted at the Chamber, JVP Leader Anura Kumara Dissanayake, said the situation could have been brought under control by Rajapaksa if he really wanted to do so.
But Rajapaksa did not make such an attempt. Instead, he was silent while his MPs were behaving in an unruly manner in the Chamber. It was he who instructed them to behave in that manner. Everything happened under his supervision. He should take full responsibility for what took place todays Parliamentary Sittings, Dissanayake said.
He pointed out that if the United Peoples Freedom Alliance (UPFA) MPs wanted to punish Palitha Thewarapperuma for bringing a butter knife into the Chamber on November 15, they should have reported it to President Maithripala Sirisena as the Police Department was under him. But, they did not do so. They wanted to stop the No-confidence Motion being passed by behaving in an unruly manner. This was the first time in history where a Speaker had come under physical assault in the Chamber. They even brought chilli powder mixed with waterto attack their fellow MPs. This is the true face of the Rajapaksa faction, he noted.
Damage done to democracy cannot be easily recovered
Following the pandemonium in the House yesterday, Ranil Wickremesinghe together with leading politicos supportive of the No Confidence Motion against Mahinda Rajapaksa, blasted the unruly behaviour of the UNFA MPs in the Chamber, in a press brief held at the Parliament premises yesterday. The damage done to democracy prevailing in the country could not be easily recovered, they observed.
Wickremesinghe pointed out that the series of incidents that took place inside the House, was a disgrace to the Nation. He observed that it held Sri Lanka low in the eyes of the International Community.
Wickremesinghe, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Sajith Premadasa, Jayawickreme Perera, Rajitha Senaratne, Mangala Samaraweera, Mano Ganesan, P. Digambaram, Rauf Hakeem and Rishad Bathiudin were present at the press briefing, which was held at the Parliament premises.
This disgraceful incident at Parliament shames the whole nation. In should be condemned in the harshest possible term. It is a blow to democracy and it is a blow to all of us who are voters of Sri Lanka in whom the sovereignty lies, Wickremesinghe observed.
Further speaking, Wickremesinghe noted that, Today Parliament convened after our delegation met the President who requested that another resolution be passed in Parliament. We acted according to that decision taken by the committee.
But unfortunately, the Chamber was occupied by a section of the MPs belonging to the SLPP and SLFP. Mahinda Rajapaksa was present in Parliament. But the Speaker was prevented from entering the Chamber.
We have seen incidents in Parliament, but not of this nature or scale. This has to be condemned, whatever the party you voted for.
We are not going to allow this to happen with the majority we have. The majority will have its way. The people would ensure that the damage done to our system was restored, but it would take a long time, Wickremesinghe noted.
The injuries sustained by Jayawickreme Perera, Malik Samarawickreme and Vijitha Herath could be with medical treatment cured, but the damage to countrys democracy, would not be easily repaired, Wickremesinghe observed.
Meanwhile, UNP MP Jayawickrema Perera who was attacked by the UPFA MPs with chili powder mixed water, addressed the media after returning from medical treatment. An emotional Jayawickreme who broke down before the cameras, requested President Maithripala Sirisena to immediately take a decision that would restore the balance and democracy in the country.
Jayawickreme Perera observed that he had been an MP for a long period of time, but nothing similar to yesterdays incident had ever taken place. Perera also commended the way in which the MPs who are supportive of the NCM behaved.
Patali Champaka Ranawaka who then addressed the media, questioned as to how fair would Mahinda Rajapaksa hold a general election if this was the way his gang members are distrupting Parliamentary proceedings and attacking the Speaker of the House. Ranawaka also questioned as to whether the Rajapaksa desciples were not even listening to the President.
We moved the resolution for the third time because the President wanted a clear vote, but the UPFA MPs kept behaving in a disgraceful manner, Ranawaka further observed. These Rajapaksa supporters utterly disregard the Constitution, Legislation and the Standing Orders for the last few days, Ranawaka said.
President Maithripala Sirisena who had the Military Forces and the Police under his control, should immediately remove Rajapaksa and his supporters from the offices they are occupying after the Speaker officially informed the President on the results of the NCM. Meanwhile, Sajith Premadasa speaking at the press briefing, pointed out that it was a battle between democracy and political terrorism, instigated by Rajapaksa and his supporters. Premadasa also pointed out that Rajapaksa was trying to have a Chili-Powder Governance. Premadasa expressed his confidance that the President would take a favourable decision soon.
Rajitha Senaratne denied the allegations levelled by UPFA MPs that the proceedings of the Chamber were illegal.

PUBLIC, INTELLECTUALS  CALL FOR GENERAL ELECTION
The prevailing situation has resulted in the people calling for the holding of a General Election as the only solution to the present political impasse.
A cross section of society including religious dignitaries said that the best solution is to hold a General Election.
People are supreme in any society in any part of the world. Therefore, the people have the right to demand for an opportunity to elect a Government of their choice and they should be given that right.
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should be held responsible for the situation we are facing today. It seems the sole purpose of the Speaker is to show to the world that the country is in a chaotic situation.
Commenting on the prevailing political situation in the country, Kelaniya Raja Maha Viharadhipathi Ven. Prof. Kollupitiye Mahinda Sangharakkitha Thera called upon the citizens to act with restraint at the present juncture.
It is a very unpleasant and sorry state of affairs that we witnessed happening within Parliament, one of the countrys most prestigious institutions. What is happening there is a very bad precedent and sets a very bad example. It is the responsibility of those maintaining law and order to see that the situation is brought under control, Ven. Prof. Sangharakkitha Thera said.
It is very sad to note that our MPs have become a commodity and getting sold. We send our representative not to be sold for a price.
They are sent to Parliament to fulfill the peoples aspirations. But, we note that nothing of the sort happens today as the people expect. We blame the Speaker for what has happened, the Thera added.
Ven. Yatamalagala Sumanasara Thera, the Executive Director of Daham Handa Centre, Pattivila told the Daily News that what President Maithripala Sirisena had predicted a few days ago, the country is experiencing right now. Those with brains should have acted wisely to avoid the recurring conflict situation.
The Ven. Thera also opined that it was necessary to carefully study the reasons behind the current situation in Parliament. I see the only tangible solution is to call for a General Election. There is no other solution, the Thera said.
There is no point in trying to add numbers by changing heads. Because that will not help in any way solve the issue. All political parties should shun their personal agendas and come to a solution that is acceptable to all, the Thera added.
Meanwhile, CAFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennakoon told the Daily News that the intervention of a third party is needed to solve the conflict in Parliament.
Speaking to the Daily News yesterday Tennakoon further emphasised that the need of the hour is to get third party involvement to resolve the present crisis in Parliament.
Tennakoon further added that the public will see that this is a conflict between President Maithripala Sirisena and Speaker Karu Jayasuriya and also a conflict between Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
The CAFFE Executive Director said the prevailing crisis situation cannot continue emphasised the need to resolve it before it gets worse and out of control. He further warned that there could be bloodshed and the loss of life if a third party does not intervene and help resolve the conflict between the top politicians in Parliament
Tennakoon further said that the politicians involved in these clashes should be ashamed of themselves for the manner in which they have acted in Parliament which has brought disrepute to Sri Lanka.
Commenting on the unruly behaviour displayed in Parliament by the Members of Parliament, legal experts stated that the violence created and unruly behaviour by certain Parliamentarians inside the House cannot be covered by Parliamentary Privileges.
Meanwhile, a Senior Counsel, who wished to remain anonymous told the Daily News that the individuals who committed criminal acts should be dealt with by the law, irrespective of their political party affiliations.
The law makers have come law breakers. Parliamentary Privileges cannot be utilised to protect their criminal acts. The police have powers to take legal action in accordance with prevailing laws, he added.
Meanwhile, Sri Lankas leading business Chambers, associations and business leaders raised concern about current political situation in Sri Lanka, noting that the political uncertainty in Sri Lanka will dampen the business confidence to a great extent in the coming days.
Issuing a joint statement, The Ceylon Chamber of Commerce (CCC), International Chamber of Commerce Sri Lanka (ICCSL), Joint Apparel Association Forum (JAAF) and The Womens Chamber of Industry and Commerce (WCCI) stressed the need to resolve this issue in a peaceful and sensible manner and noted that events of the last few weeks have resulted in absolute instability which is a situation that Sri Lanka simply cannot afford.
The joint statement further noted that political uncertainty will have a significant impact on the social and economic trajectory of our country and the hinder the development of the country to a great extent.
Noting that entire administration of this country has come to a standstill and the public officers are paralyzed being unable to discharge their functions, the joint statement said, the ultimate victims are the people of our country.
We call upon all those responsible to accord the highest priority to national interest and refrain from pursuing any path that will result in an economic downfall which will have an adverse impact on the country and the people. We call for urgent and sensible action, the statement said.
Meanwhile, senior investment advisor attached to the SC Securities said business confidence especially among foreign investors has been tepid during the last couple of weeks and this uncertain political atmosphere will have a profound impact on overall stock market activities in Sri Lanka.

Rahal's last minute try gives Havies 30-29 win
The Havelock Sports Club prop forward former Peterite Rahal Delpachithra scored a superb last minute try to help his team beat CH and FC by 30 points ( 4 tries, 2 conversions, 2 penalties) to 29 ( 2 tries, 2 conversions, 4 penalties, 1 Drop Goal) in their Dialog A Division inter-club league rugby first round match played at Havelock park in Colombo yesterday. At half time CH led 16-13.
CH and FC started off brilliantly, and raced to a score of 16 points against 13 with a try, drop goal and 2 penalties in the first half. But Havies did well to comeback in the second half with a fiery display as the Maitlend crescent boys slowed down the pace of the game.
CH opened scoring with a superb 45 metre drop goal slotted in by fly half Samuel Maduwantha to go into a 3-nil lead. The Havies equalled the score with a fine 30-metre penalty fired across by full back Rizah Mubarak.

Road Traffic Victims Remembrance day falls tomorrow
The World Day of Remembrance for Road Traffic Victims is commemorated on the third Sunday of November each year in remembrance of the millions of people killed and injured on roads and their families.
It was initiated by the British Road Crash Victim Charity, Road Peace in 1993, and since then, it has been observed and promoted worldwide by several NGOs.
On October 26, 2005, the the United Nations endorsed it as a global day to be observed every third Sunday in November each year.
Consultant Community Physician of the Non Communicable Disease (NCD) Unit, Ministry of Health Dr Samitha Siritunga stressed the importance of implementing a well planned programme to prevent road traffic accidents in the country.
He said that there was an increasing trend in road traffic fatalities. According to statistics of the Police Department, around 3,153 persons were killed in road traffic accidents in 2017 and around 8 deaths reported daily in Sri Lanka due to such accidents, while the majority of them were between the ages of 15 to 44 years. Apart from that, a large number of victims become totally disabled. This situation has been a bad affect to the development of the country.
Motorcyclists and pedestrians remain the most vulnerable to become a fatality among road users. High speed, drunk driving and the usage of mobile phones while driving, sleepiness and fatigue were the most common causes for road accidents, the Consultant Physician said.

England lead by 278 runs with one wicket in hand :
Root (124) and Dananjaya (6/106) excel on day three
PALLEKELE, Friday  In an extraordinary third days play England captain Joe Root scored an important hundred which could turn out to be a series deciding one, and Sri Lanka spinner Akila Dananjaya with a point to prove after being reported for his action in the Galle Test took a career best six wickets for 106 runs  his third five-fors in just three Tests to have the second cricket Test in the balance at the Pallakele International Stadium yesterday.
At the end of the third day brought forward by bad light and rain that lopped off 15 overs of the days quota England finished on 304 for nine wickets in their second innings to lead overall by 278.
Ben Foakes was batting on 51 scored off 102 balls (3 fours, 1 six) and Jimmy Anderson was on four. Englands last wicket pair will look to extend the lead as close to 300 when play resumes on the fourth day today and then try and bowl Sri Lanka out to give them a winning 2-0 lead in the three-match series.
The pitch for all the turn, bounce and bite it produced on the first two days, seemed to have settled down to a slow turner with only the odd ball providing unusual bounce whenever it hit a rough patch, otherwise as Joe Burns, Root, Jos Buttler and Foakes showed batting was not as all difficult as it was on the first innings.
The fact remained that six batsmen got out sweeping and there were just three maidens out of a total of 76 bowled in the England innings thus far, which speaks volumes of Englands spirited approach.
The way England batted it looked as if they had found a way of making batting progress on turning pitches for virtually all the batsmen took the risk of using the sweep and reverse sweep shots to good effect.
There was less turn and bounce and the unplayable delivery for the Lankan spinners who tried too hard for wicket balls rather than trying to build up pressure.
England lost four wickets in the morning session that produced 131 runs, but only two more in the afternoon when they added a further 128 with Root holding centre stage going to tea on 98 not out. Burns completed his maiden Test fifty before falling lbw to Malinda Pushpakumara for 59 scored off 66 balls (7 fours).
Root brought up his 15th Test hundred and second against Sri Lanka off the second ball after tea guiding the ball from Suranga Lakmal between slip and gully to the third man boundary for his eighth four amidst a loud roar from the England supporters who outnumbered the locals on the ground.
Buttler (34) helped his captain add 74 for the fifth wicket and Foakes a further 82 for the seventh. In between these stands Dananjaya kept England on their toes by picking up wickets constantly and was on a hat-trick when he dismissed Root for 124 scored off 146 balls (10 fours, 2 sixes) and first innings top scorer Sam Curran for a golden duck off successive deliveries in the 70th over.
It is unfortunate that Sri Lanka will not have the services of Dananjaya for the third and final Test at the SSC starting on November 23 as he is due to travel to Brisbane to undergo biomechanical testing on his bowling action after it was reported at the end of the first Test at Galle.

Smith, Warner to make IPL return next year
Former Australia captain Steve Smith and vice-captain David Warner have been retained by their respective Indian Premier League (IPL) franchises after the duo missed the previous edition following the ball-tampering scandal in South Africa.
The pair are serving year-long bans for their part in the Cape Town incident in March and were barred from the 2018 IPL tournament.
The 12th edition of the lucrative Twenty20 league will be played from March 29 to May 19, having been brought forward because of the 50-over World Cup in England, which begins on May 30.
The batsmens bans will end on the same day the tournament starts and they could end up playing in the IPL before their compatriots after Cricket Australia (CA) imposed a series of conditions for the participation of contracted players.
Australian cricketers need to receive permission from their home board and must be available to play at the World Cup and on the Ashes tour of England that follows in August and September.
CA said players involved in the Sheffield Shield final will only be released once that concluded on April 1, while the 15 players selected to defend the World Cup must attend a mandatory training camp in early May and play warm-up matches.
Smith has also been banned from taking on a leadership position for an additional 12 months and Warner, who led the Sunrisers Hyderabad to a maiden IPL title in 2016, will not be allowed to serve in an Australian leadership position again.
The Rajasthan Royals and Sunrisers paid $1.67 million each at last years IPL auction for the services of Smith and Warner.

Speaker informs President that motion against PM moved by JVP leader duly passed
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya had informed President Maithripala Sirisena in writing yesterday, that the No-confidence motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, moved by Chief Opposition Whip Anura Kumara Dissanayake, was duly passed in line with Standing Orders that govern Parliamentary business.
The Office of the Speaker stated so, issuing a press release.
The motion was presented to Parliament by MP Anura Kumara Dissanayake and seconded by MP Vijitha Herath.
This was in accordance with the decision taken at a special meeting held with the President, the Speaker and Party leaders on Thursday evening (15).
The press release issued by the Speakers Office stated that, in terms of Article 48(2) of the Constitution, Parliament accepts the official statement on the dissolution of the Cabinet of Ministers, as well as the No-confidence motion against Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa and his government.
The Speakers Office said the No-confidence motion which was passed along with the signatures of 112 Parliamentarians, had been sent to President Maithripala Sirisena by the Speaker.

Speaker needs to act sombre for House to be in order
Cabinet Spokesperson Mahinda Samarasinghe addressing a media briefing immediately after the fracas at Parliament said that Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should take the sole responsibility for the lack of decorum and tension that ensued in Parliament yesterday.
The Speaker should have immediately convened a party leaders meeting knowing very well that tensions were flaring, said Minister Samarasinghe.
He should and could have easily diffused this without hurriedly rushing through a No-confidence motion. He added that he has never seen a Speaker being escorted by so many police officers to the floor of Parliament adding that much of it could have been negated if the speaker did not abuse his powers to support the United National Party.
It is plain to see that much of this was pre-planned and the speaker walked out wanting to help the UNP prove that they yield the majority.
Minister Samarasinghe added that the Speaker convened a party leaders meeting at 11 at noon yesterday but failed to mention that the NCM would even be taken up.
The President had expressed concerns over the first clause of the NCM, since the matter is before courts and asked that it clause be excluded and standing orders be followed before the NCM is put to the floor test. He said, The President made it very clear that he would not prorogue Parliament provided the speaker followed due procedures and protocols.
He said that according to Parliamentary procedures, a minimum of five days should be devoted and all party leaders should be in agreement on the date that the NCM would be taken.
We told the Speaker not to take it up hurriedly. NCMs are decisive matters for which due notice should be given. We did not even have a copy of the NCM and didnt realize until it was brought out at the last minute. He added that many of the MPs were calling for the Speaker to take action on certain MPs who were wielding knives.
The Speaker assured us that the would investigate, despite the fact that was substantial irrefutable evidence over which he could have easily taken action, he said. He should use powers to safeguard and ensure the safety of all the MPs. How can one expect to have decorum in the house when the speaker is acting in a frenzied manner.

Test cricket: Imperative to change the growing home dominance
Home advantage is something every home team wants and it is fair enough. But to what extent Should it compromise with the quality of the game Should it be just enough to take an opposition victory out of the equation Well, the questions are plenty, the doubts are never-ending and it is high time these questions are answered.
The win-loss ratio for an away team (among top seven teams excluding West Indies, Bangladesh and Zimbabwe) has been on a decline, a gradual decline it has been since the advent of the century. The beginning of the 21st century (2000 to 2004) saw an away win-loss ratio of 0.78 by the top 8 teams.
This was a significant increase from past decade, where the ratio remained 0.55 (among top eight teams, including West Indies).
Test Cricket probably saw its healthiest period. Much credit goes to the invincible Aussies who won almost everywhere during this period, not only matches, but series too. The away win-loss ratio started to take a downward slide the next five year period, i.e, between 2005-2009. Only 31 wins were recorded against 64 losses as compared to a 44-56 ratio between 2000 and 2004. The ratio fell alarmingly, 0.48 it was. But this was not the only bad phase for away teams. It was just the beginning of something worse. Since 2010, the ratio has further dropped to 0.37, including a 1-21 win-loss ratio in 2013.
It has now become almost a norm that home team will anyway win the series, and the away teams at best win a few games here and there, but not the series. Only one or at max two away series wins are seen per year, sometimes even none.
India are almost invincible at home, Australia have lost test series only to South Africa (twice) at home since 2011 and the same can be said about England and South Africa as well. Only New Zealand and Sri Lanka remain vulnerable at home and that too if we take conditions into account, both Sri Lanka New Zealand have been beaten by teams whose home conditions are similar. Pakistan playing at UAE have also dominated immensely during this period.
South Africa have proved to be the best touring nation in this period with 17 wins and 14 losses (since 2005). Also they are the only team to have a ratio greater than 1. They have won almost in every nation where spin did not make an impact. They are followed by Australia (0.68) and India (0.53), the only other teams to have a ratio more than 0.5 since 2005. However, even the top three teams have struggled to win in conditions dissimilar to their home. SA have won 2 and lost 5 matches in India, the only country where they could not win a series in this period. India have 0.4 ratio in SA, 0.3 in England and 0.13 in Aus since 2005. Australia too have fared poorly in India, losing 10 and winning only 1 and that single win came in 2017 after 13 years.
The bad tourist tag is therefore not only limited to certain subcontinent teams, but to each and every test playing nation at the moment. Australia are below par in the subcontinent, losing 9 consecutive series to subcontinent teams away from home (lost even to Bangladesh in 2017), so are England and New Zealand.
SA too have been found wanting on pitches assisting spin. India and Sri Lanka have struggled on pitches offering pace and bounce.
NEUTRAL VENUES OR NO TOSS
This downside of away win-loss ratio has to be ceased sooner than later, to bring more life to Test cricket. Whether it is the quality of teams or the conditions on offer or both which has led to this situation is something the ICC needs to ponder about.
One solution might be to conduct neutral Test series but then the problem of empty stands arises. Imagine something like a New Zealand vs Sri Lanka Test going on at Wankhede, or a Pakistan vs England Test at Galle. The stands would only be seen empty and the revenue will take a beating. Another solution is to take the toss out of the equation. With the home team already having the home advantage, the away captain should be directly allowed to choose whether to bat or field.
This might bring in more balance to the game.
Test cricket needs to be more balanced, needs more life in the contests. Series like the India-Australia in 2017, Sri Lanka-Pakistan in 2017 and South Africa-Australia in 2016 need to happen more often. For Test cricket to revive itself and gain back its viewers, the away teams need to fight better at least, if not win.

Theresa May faces major crisis in Commons
UK Prime Minister Theresa May is plunged into a deep political crisis, facing a rejection of the Brexit negotiations with the European Union, and also a motion of No Confidence against her in the Conservative Party.
After a five hour Cabinet meeting at her residence 10, Downing Street on Wednesday (14) she came out a told the media that the Cabinet had approved the final agreement with the EU. She stressed that the negotiations with the EU that went on since the UK referendum on leaving the EU in 2016 was based on the British national interest.
However, on Thursday (15) as she faced the House of Commons to explain the draft agreement (which also has to be approved by the other 27 EU members), she faced a major challenge, with two key ministers of her government resigning. These were the Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab, followed quickly by Brexit-backing Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey. Two junior ministers and two ministerial aides also resigned.
Significantly, Dominic Raab is the second minister handling the Brexit negotiations to resign from Mays Cabinet. The first was David Davis, who served as Secretary of State for exiting the EU from July 2016 to July 2018. In July 2018, shortly after Theresa May said she had Cabinet approval for what was described as the Chequers Plan for leaving the EU, the Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, also resigned from the Cabinet. Dominic Raab is the second Brexit Secretary to resign in four months, showing the increasing lack of support has within both the Government and the Conservative Party, which she heads and leads the government.
Prime Minister May is also faced with the disapproval of the Brexit Exit Plan by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) of Northern Ireland. Theresa May who does not have Conservative majority in the Commons is dependent on 10 MPs of the DUP for the government majority on key issues in the Commons. This is now clearly challenged.
In a damning verdict of the Draft Brexit proposal Dominic Raab has said Mays plan had major and fatal flaws, coming from the minister who was closely involved with the negotiations with the EU.
Among others who have moved out of Theresa Mays administration in the current crisis are junior Northern Ireland Minister Shailesh Vara, junior Brexit Minister Suella Braveman, and Parliamentary Private Secretaries Anne-Marie Trevelyan and Ranil Jayewardena.
The Opposition Labour Party is wholly against Mays Brexit proposals and Labour leader and Leader of the Opposition Jeremy Corbyn has said a botched deal that breaches the government's own red lines.
Meanwhile, in a bigger threat to Theresa May is the move to have a vote of No Confidence on her. Stave Baker, a fellow of the European Research Group and MP Rees-Mogg are talking of moving ahead with such a motion very soon. A letter to this effect has already been given to the chairman of the1922 Committee, which handles such issues, and it needs additional signatures, which are likely to come.
With the opposition to the Theresa May moves for Brexit increasing, there is a rising call for a second referendum on UK leaving the EU, which is opposed by Theresa May. The earlier referendum on the UK leaving the EU saw a vote of 51.9% to leave, which has put the UK on a course to leave the EU by end March 2019. Those calling for a second referendum say the voters were not given the full facts about the exit from the EU in the run up to the 2016 referendum. Theresa May was opposed to the UK leaving the EU, but decided to support it after she was chosen as Prime Minister following the resignation of Prime Minister David Cameron, who introduced the referendum, but campaigned to remain in the EU, with certain conditions.
Meanwhile, the EU says much work still needs to be done on Brexit, despite agreeing a draft withdrawal document with the UK. We still have a long road ahead of us on both sides, chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier said. The EU has set out a series of meetings leading to one on November 25 where it plans to approve the Brexit agreement.
Trump - Macron
French President Emmanuel Macron and US President Donald Trump were in a major verbal clash over Nationalism in the past week, raising new questions about the relations between the US and France and Europe. The clash took place when President Macron called for the forming of a real European army to protect the continent with respect to China, Russia and even the United States of America. He spoke while on a tour of World War 1 memorials, marking the century after the end of World War 1, when he also said: We will not protect the Europeans unless we decide to have a true European army.
This is a trend of Macrons thinking for nearly one year, but has received urgency after President Trump announced last month that the U.S. would pull out of a Cold War era nuclear weapons treaty with Russia, and Trump has also displayed a tepid attitude in the past towards NATO's mutual defense commitments.
President Macron condemned nationalism on Sunday in a fiery speech widely interpreted as a rebuke against President Trumps America First agenda. Speaking at the Arc de Triomphe in Paris at a World War I commemoration ceremony attended by Trump, Macron suggested nationalism could lead to the same death and devastation seen during that war. Nationalism is a betrayal of patriotism. By saying our interests first, who cares about the others, we erase what a nation holds dearest, what gives it life, what makes it great and what is essential: its moral values, he said as Trump looked on. I know there are old demons which are coming back to the surface. They are ready to wreak chaos and death, he said. History sometimes threatens to take its sinister course once again.
Macrons comments come just a few weeks after Trump declared himself a nationalist at a Texas campaign rally, sparking concerns that the label could embolden neo-Nazis and far-right nationalistsa fear that Trump later suggested was racist.
President Trump soon unleashed verbal attacks on President Macron, taking aim at his approval rating, his countrys employment rate, its trade policies on wine and his vision for the military.
In the first of several barbs Tuesday on Twitter, Trump again misrepresented what Macron had said during last weeks radio interview against nationalism, and reminded him of the U.S. militarys role in aiding France in World War I and II.
Emmanuel Macron suggests building its own army to protect Europe against the U.S., China and Russia, Trump wrote. But it was Germany in World Wars One & Two  How did that work out for France They were starting to learn German in Paris before the U.S. came along.
In the continuing Tweetstorm attacked Macron stating: The problem is that Emmanuel suffers from a very low Approval Rating in France, 26%, and an unemployment rate of almost 10%. He was just trying to get onto another subject. By the way, there is no country more Nationalist than France, very proud people-and rightfully so!
MAKE FRANCE GREAT AGAIN! Trump added, in a play on his campaign slogan.
In another Twitter attack, Trump complained of a trade disparity suggesting that it makes it harder for U.S. winemakers to sell their products in France.
On Trade, France makes excellent wine, but so does the U.S., Trump wrote. The problem is that France makes it very hard for the U.S. to sell its wines into France, and charges big Tariffs, whereas the U.S. makes it easy for French wines, and charges very small Tariffs. Not fair, must change!
Following Trumps attacks on Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel came to Macrons defense, echoing his initial call for a real European army.
We want to work on the vision of eventually creating a real European army, Merkel said in a speech to the European Parliament. Her remarks implied that such a project would not be pursued imminently. But a European army, Merkel said, would show the world that there will never again be war between the European countries.
In a stab at Trump, Merkel said that the times when Europe could rely on others were simply over.
Old allies cast doubts over tried and tested ties, she said, in what was seen as a likely reference to the United States.
The disagreements and verbal clashes between Trump and Macon, and the intervention of Angela Merkel too, shows the growing differences between the US and Europe, following President Trump's foreign policy moves which are often critical of allies who have stood together since the end of World War II. This indicates the rise of new relations both within and outside Europe on foreign and defense policies, with some European countries, such as Italy and Hungary looking at closer ties with Russia.

Tolerance Vs intolerance
The International Day for Tolerance falls on November 16. UNESSCO Director General Audrey Azouloy says, Tolerance is an act of humanity and we must nurture and enact each in own lives every day, to rejoice in the diversity that makes us strong and the values that bring us together.
The UN with its resolution 51/95 asked its member States to observe the International Day for Tolerance on November 16 and observed 1995 as the Year for Tolerance as the UN General Assembly proclaimed in 1993 under the request of UNESCO. The latter submitted the Declaration of Principles on Tolerance and a plan of action for the year.
In 1995 the UN introduced the UNESCO-Madanjeet Sing Prize to promote tolerance and demote violence. It awards the price biennially on November 16 to those scientists, artistes, and activists whose activities promote tolerance. This year it will be awarded to a businessperson and filmmaker Manon Barbeau, a Canadian and the Coexist, a Kenyan non-profit organisation that work to end violence against women.
Consequently, a new scheme of the UN was launched called TOGETHER to make people understand the importance of being tolerance. It demotes countries attitudes towards migrants and refugees and promotes good contacts of host countries towards them. In 2018, the UN along with YouTube launched Creators For Change, a video campaign to promote tolerance among its members and every other country towards difference activities and ideas.
The world has gone to pieces now owing to its peoples intolerance. They increasingly distrust others and find faults in their ideas, beliefs and actions. Therefore, they are constantly impatient and stressful. They think that their decisions, beliefs and every thought and activity are reasonable and that others are always attempting to disregard and defeat theirs.
Intolerance, therefore, impedes progress. Since its manifestations are negative, people suffering from it undoubtedly are selfish. They cannot accept that other people need freedom and that they have right to follow their religions, customs, and beliefs. Because of this, destructions and genocides are reported daily from every part of the world.
Developed nations
Meanwhile, science in its evaluation has answered many issues that feed intolerance. It still does. Unfortunately, its incapability to dispel inherited traits of the mankind is beyond doubt now, with the high number of dismal events being reported worldwide. The developed nations, too, alienate from scientifically proved facts thereby dragging the humankind into their extinction fast.
Last month, USA President Donald Trump stated that his country would separate from the Paris Climate Change Agreement that holds signatures of 196 countries. They including America agreed on April 22, 2016 in New York that they will take steps to curtail activities that drag the world into its doomsday.
Scientists worldwide in their hundreds, however, have proved that global temperature is alarmingly increasing and revealed that the USA including a few other countries is a main contributor to the global warming. But USA President Donald Trump in October, 2018 said that they would separate from the agreement since its agents carry out a political agenda behind their effort against the US.
Blinded by the selfish agendas, powerful nations find faults with agreements signed for the benefit of the humankind. They consider only their benefits and condemn scientifically proven facts and do not tolerate others even for the sake of the entire world.
Moreover, religious intolerance too has created mayhem. The Western world exterminated nations in other beliefs and continues to do so even today. Afghanistan, Syria, Iraq, Palestine and many others in the Arab world underwent massive destruction since some other countries do not tolerate their belief. They in turn do not tolerate other beliefs and wield war or terrorism against them.
People go against their own even when they cannot endure their ideas, beliefs and concept or activities. Malala Yousafzai, a Pakistani girl, was shot at on November 9, 2012 when she was travelling in a bus along with two other girls. She was unconscious a long duration and transferred to the Queen Elizabeth Hospital in England where her condition improved and turned over a new leaf of life. Today she is a popular and ardent activist against violence against women and supporter of their well-being.
Maltese journalist, Daphne Caruana Galizia died in a bomb explosion near her house on October 16. Allegedly, several companies in Panama had carried out her assassination. She was 53 when she was killed. Her blog Running Commentary commenced in 2008 was highly popular. She criticized politicians, government officials and other high rankers mercilessly for justice. Those who cannot tolerate her views assassinated her brutally near her own house by setting a car bomb.
On September 6, 2017, gunmen on motorcycles killed Indian journalist Gauri Lankesh outside her house. Allegedly, Hindu nationalists were behind the assassination. She wrote about fearlessly against extremists and supportive of the down trodden which led to her murder. People in many States in India protested in their thousands against the murders but the assassinators were not found to date.
Violence in Syria
According to UN reporters, Myanmar military killed over 29,000 Rohingyan and over 700,000 Rohingyan fled the country. The Myanmar majority ethnic group unleashed violence against the Rohingyans in the Rakhane State in Mynmar in August 2017. The crisis intensified overnight and thousands of Rohingyans fled the country to Bangladesh seeking refugee.
According to the Syrian Journalists Association, over 150 journalists died in violence in Syria throughout its civil war because terrorists and the Syrian government could not tolerate different ideas and activities. This year, over 47 journalists were killed in foreign countries and in their own countries because they struggled against extremists.
How to be tolerant has to be taught from the childhood. Children prefer learning each others likes and dislikes. However, the adults do not allow them to mix and learn from each others. They restrict the childhood and cut short its learning of the ways how to endure others. The result is chaos and mayhem.

ICC Womens World T20 2018 :
Unbeaten India qualify for semi-finals
India have made it three in three at the ICC Womens World T20 2018, and Smriti Mandhana, the vice-captain of the team, wants the team to maintain their dominant run.
India beat Ireland by 52 runs in their third Group B match to make it three wins in a row and qualify for the semi-finals. They now face Australia in their final league game on 17 November and Mandhana, the opening bat, said that the team will look at the game as just another match and not put themselves under any undue pressure.
I think we will be looking at it as a match only and not just like we need to be on the top of the table of this group, she said of the fixture against the other undefeated team in the group.
Thats what our mindset will be, and to go all out. Before coming into the World T20, Ramesh (Powar, the coach) had told us that you have to dominate each and every match, so that is the only mindset which we had the last three matches, and I dont think it will change in the next match.
That said, Mandhana suggested that India were somewhat below par against Ireland, having failed to reach the target of 170 that they had marked for themselves.
The first two matches I definitely felt we were good, but today I felt batting could have been better, said Mandhana, who scored 33 and added 67 for the first wicket with Mithali Raj (51). But bowling and fielding I think we are really good, and we dominated the opposition.
Because of the overnight rains in Guyana, the wicket was a bit damp, but Mandhana nevertheless thought that India should have got more than the 145/6 they eventually managed. Ireland were restricted to 93/8 in reply.
India have now made the semi-final in a second consecutive ICC tournament  after reaching the final of the ICC Womens World Cup 2017  and Mandhana said that the feat means a lot especially after losing to Bangladesh in the Asia Cup 2018 final six months ago, a defeat that had ushered in a few changes.
Powar was appointed the head coach after that tournament, and Mandhana thinks the former India off-spinner has been brilliant in the last three four months.
We are such a good team, we have such good youngsters that we need to step up our game every match, and this World Cup was ... we needed to go to the semi-finals, and all 15 of us actually went back after Asia Cup, worked hard on whatever they felt we lacked in the team.
Scores: India Women 145-6 in 20 overs (Mithali Raj 51, Smitri Mandhana 33, Kim Garth 2/22)
Ireland Women 93-8 in 20 overs (Clare Shillington 23, Isobel Joyce 33, Radha Yadav 3/25, Deepthi Sharma 2/15)

Virat Kohli reveals main reason behind his prolific run with the bat
Indian captain Virat Kohli has pushed the bar as far as fitness is concerned in Indian cricket. From being a chubby young boy, to now one of the fittest athletes in the game, it has certainly been one impressive transformation.
I will not say something which is inaccurate. I will not say that I never thought that fitness will make me look good, because at some stage everyone thinks that way, Kohli told India Today.
Kohli brought a concerted change to his lifestyle, his diet and training process and the way he has given up on his once staple diet is well documented. The captain himself has conceded he made it a point that fitness will be his goal if and that it will push his cricket to the next level.
Eventually, you realise that it does so much good to you in terms of your mental state, in terms of how you feel and how much more you can do. It is not confined to just sport because even in a work scenario as well, if you are fit, you will be able to work more and achieve more. You will be able to be more productive because if you lack energy you will not be as productive as you should be, Kohli added.
After the initial struggles and effort, the Indian captain says that fitness and high-intensity training has become a part of his lifestyle.
Now, I dont do fitness to look good but to stay fit and obviously, I have professional requirements as well. But even after that (cricket), I dont think it will change and will become a life style, Kohli said.
