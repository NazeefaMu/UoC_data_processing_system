GMOA to send details of malpractices to President
We will forward the complaint to President Maithripala Sirisena which was forwarded to the GMOA by staff of the State Pharmaceutics Corporation (SPC) in connection with Rs. 70 million loss due to malpractice in the tender procedure.
The President should arrange the funeral of the former Health Ministers political journey to save the country and people from him, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) Secretary Dr. Haritha Aluthge said.
Speaking at a press conference at the GMOA Headquarters in Colombo yesterday, he said the written evidence will be forwarded to the President. Investigation should be conducted to find out who obtained the commission.
A Presidential Commission is needed to investigate all acts of corruption and malpractice of the former Health Minister. The GMOA receives a large number of complaints daily. All complaints will be forwarded to the President with written evidence.
GMOA Assistance Secretary Dr. Navin De Zoysa said the ticks are now disturbed knowing that the dog will die soon.
This is why a male nurse and another hold press conferences and try their best to save the former Health Minister.
The vacancies of the Health Minister and Health Secretary should be filled immediately. The President can do it properly because he knows the subject very well.
Dr. De Zoysa said that according to Facebook, the former Health Minister will be added to Sri Lankan history as the first ever Sri Lankan Cabinet Minister who paid money to the government to obtain a ministerial post.
A minister who does not create factions among health staff and does not try to implement private agendas should not be appointed.
The GMOA neither makes nor breaks governments, but since 1926, has given leadership to the people during issues and will continue to do so, he said.

It was taxpayers money that the former Minister had misused. Dolawatte said he hoped the IGP would not only pay attention to this serious complaint, but also conduct a proper and fair investigation into it.
Fielding a question raised by the media, Dolawatte said that his organisation had made several other complaints too to the IGP during the past, but the IGP had failed to investigate them.

SPEAKERS OPINION UNCONSTITUTIONAL
Speaker Karu Jayasuriya should take full responsibility if his opinions, aired with political bias and at the request of one political party creates political instability or unrest among the public, the Government stated yesterday.
The Government also expressed its dissatisfaction over the Speakers attempt to create unrest and instability in the country by acting beyond his powers. Commenting on the statement issued by the Speaker that he is compelled to accept the status that existed previously, Foreign Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama said that by issuing statements, the Speaker has demonstrated personal and political bias, adding it was an undemocratic and an unconstitutional move.
He said that even if all 225 MPs had signed a letter, the Speaker cannot convene Parliament. Minister Amunugama said it was very evident that the statement made by the Speaker was totally biased and that the Speaker has no power to reconvene Parliament and it is violation of the Constitution.
As Speaker he should remain neutral. He cannot issue politically biased statements. The President did not violate the Constitution or the law, he said.
Dr.Amunugama emphasised that the President prorogued Parliament in order to provide ample time to prepare the 2019 Budget since they needed time to prepare a practical budget unlike the previous Yahapalana Government.
He said the Speaker does not have any powers according to the Constitution to take a decision on convening or proroguing Parliament.
The Speaker does not have any power to decide who should sit in the Prime Ministers seat. That is a decision taken by the President. No provision in the Constitution says the President has to consult the Speaker to appoint a new Prime Minister, he explained.
He noted that nobody can run a Government based on political gossip initiated by some people and added that the personal views of the Speaker should not be taken into account when taking decisions on Parliamentary proceedings.
Ports and Shipping Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe said that even if all 225 MPs had signed a letter, the Speaker cannot convene Parliament. He said it was very evident that the statement made by the Speaker was totally biased.
Minister Samarasinghe said it was ethically and morally wrong for a Speaker to act in this manner. The Speaker unofficially arranged three meetings at the Parliament complex and insisted that a majority had signed a document emphasising that the Speaker should convene Parliament. He should act in accordance with the Constitution,and not according to his own whims, he said.
He said that even after the February 10 Local Government Elections, the President prorogued Parliament. Minister Samarasinghe said that it was unethical for the Speaker to issue this statement on the same day that the President issued the Gazette to convene Parliament on November 14, two days earlier than the previously scheduled date of November 16.
He requested the Speaker to respect democracy and the Constitution.
Education and Higher Education Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe said the Presidents power to appoint the PM according to his will was not curtailed under the 19th Amendment to the Constitution.
He said that when Ranil Wickremesinghe was appointed as the Prime Minister in January 2015, he did not have the majority support and it was President Sirisena who made the decision. Minister Rajapakshe recalled that nobody protested over that decision made by the President.
The Government is going to present the Budget next week and if they want they can defeat the budget, he said. He further emphasised that under Section 70 (3) of the Constitution, the President has powers to prorogue and convene Parliament.
Minister Rajapakshe said the Speaker might have to take full responsibility if any unfortunate incidents happen as a result of his actions.
MP Thilanga Sumathipala said that as a former Deputy Speaker, he was disappointed by the statement made by the Speaker of Parliament.
He further said that it should have been a smooth transition and added that it was an illegal move by the speaker.
MP Sumathipala said that even the employees are in a difficult situation as a result of the Speakers statements and activities.
He noted that the Speaker is standing as a barrier to the Parliamentary proceedings.
Standing Orders cannot be changed and each one of us is bound to respect and follow the Constitution, he said.
MP Sumathipala said that the Speaker is trying to create instability through his actions.
Foreign Affairs Minister Dr. Sarath Amunugama responding to the question raised by a journalist about the interpretation of the Constitution, said that only the Supreme Court has the powers to interpret on the Constitution.
He further said that Ranil Wickremesinghe has not chosen to go through that procedure.

Time to foster understanding among communities
Today marks Deepavali  the festival of lights. Deepavali underscores the great spiritual values of Hinduism, and is an occasion for Hindus to strive for greater spirituality, foster understanding among communities, and promote harmony among people.
According to the Hindu tradition, this day commemorates the triumph of Lord Krishna over the demon Naraksura and the bringing of light and blessings to this world.
Hindu devotees in Sri Lanka celebrate Deepavali by engaging in religious observances. The festival of Deepavali symbolises the victory of light over darkness, good over evil and knowledge over ignorance.
I convey my warmest felicitations to all Hindu devotees in Sri Lanka on this joyous occasion.

Victory of light over darkness
It is a pleasure to send this message of greetings on the occasion of the festival of Deepavali celebrated by Hindus throughout the world, symbolising the victory of light over darkness, and knowledge over ignorance to inculcate noble values such as spiritual discipline and wisdom in the hearts of the people.
The meaning of Deepavali is to illuminate the lives of all individuals, just as lighting a lamp eliminates darkness, and dispels evil. Deepavali is also a unique cultural festival that builds deep bonds of love and kindness between people. Cultural festivals such as Deepavali play a pivotal role in building coexistence and reconciliation among different communities that suffered numerous adversities due to separation over the past decades.
I believe that Deepavali offers a fresh opportunity for us to foster cultural relations.
I wish all the Hindus in Sri Lanka and around the world a happy Deepavali festival as they celebrate this important day with utmost devotion to nurture love and moral values.

We have a majority - President
President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday said that he has the majority of 113 to form a formidable government.
He said that farmers, government servants, fishermen, and the working mass who were gripped by the economic principles of Ranil Wickremesinghe should be freed.
The decisions of the previous government were not taken by the President, Cabinet of Ministers or the Senior Ministers, but by a swarm of butterflies headed by the former Prime Minister, President Maithripala Sirisena said.
President Sirisena was addressing the Rata Rakina Jana Mahimaya vibrant peoples protest rally at the Parliament Junction last evening.
The protest was held under the patronage of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa in support of the new government which was appointed a week ago.
President Sirisena said he was happy to be on the same poitical platform with Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa after exactly four years.
Speaking to the large crowds that braved the heavy rains, the President said that the appointment of Mahinda Rajapaksa as Prime Minister by removing former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was Constitutional and legal.
He said this appointment is not just the changing of two persons or two bodies to that chair, but also the removing of the vision that followed foreign agendas and was harmful to the state.
President Sirisena said he appointed a new person who is state friendly and who has a clear vision for the country and one who would not bow down to foreign agendas.
Amidst the thundering applause of the massive crowds, the President also said that the new government headed by him without any doubt would have a majority of 113 in Parliament.
Therefore, President Sirisena said the United National Party should not worry about that and he through the new government would strengthen Parliament. The President also requested former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe to let the new government proceed with its business without any hindrance.
The President said that he together with Prime Minister Rajapaksa would make the necessary changes in the country to solve the economic problems. He also said that they would totally dedicate themselves to solving the issues of the people in the Northern areas.
He said during his recent telephone conversation, the UN Secretary General assured him of the fullest support towards Sri Lanka for any decision taken to strengthen democracy in the country.
Therefore, he said that new government would forge ahead to create a prosperous country and establish the peace in the country while maintaining a friendly foreign policy.

We are united for countrys sake -Prime Minister
President Maithripala Sirisena and my self reunited, for the betterment of the people and the country after a lapse of four years, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
People praised President Maithripala Sirisena for appointing me as the Prime Minister endorsing the real mandate received at the last Local Government polls, Prime Minister Rajapaksa said.
The Prime Minister was addressing the Rata Rakina Jana Mahimaya public protest rally at the Parliament Junction, Battaramulla.
A large crowd of people participated in this protest in support of the government despite the heavy rains.
We thank the President for taking this decision for the betterment of the country and the people.
This was a serious course of action, he added.
However, the Prime Minister said it was not difficult for both of them to work together as they had a very old friendship.
We seperated temporarily but are now reunited for the betterment of the people and the country, Premier Rajapaksa added.
Former Prime Minister Wickremesinghe is responsible for selling the countrys assets and resources that are to the people and the future generations to foreign countries.
He ruled the country in an arbitrary manner by putting a high debt burden on the public.
Those were the reasons that urged us to go for a remedial programme, the Prime Minister said.
From the very the first day I assumed duties at the Finance Ministry, I looked for ways of reducing the tax burden and the fuel price.
This was possible.
That is why we reduced them over a night, the Premier stressed.
Prime Minister Rajapaksa said the previous government did not take these measures as they just wanted a luxury life while the people suffered due to heavy burden cast on them.
We are duty bound to look into the peoples welfare, develop the country and protect democracy, the Prime Minister said.
While stressing that they wont allow anyone to break the unity between the President and the Prime Minister by spreading rumours, the Premier also requested all the minority political parties to join with them on behalf of their people in each and every part of the country to develop the country.
Thousands of Sri Lanka Freedom Party supporters together with the supporters of other constituent political parties joined the protest which was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena.
Former Prime Minister D.M. Jayaratne, Cabinet, State, and Deputy Ministers, Parliamentarians, Provincial Council members, and members of Local Government bodies of the United Peoples Freedom Alliance, religious representatives, civil society organisations and Trade Union members joined the rally.

Nominal GDP
Western Province accounts for largest share
The Western Province continued to account for the largest share of the countrys nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP), the Government Information Department said in statement.
The Provincial Gross Domestic Product (PGDP) estimated by the Statistics Department of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) by disaggregating the annual nominal Gross Domestic Product (GDP) figures published by the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) shows that the Western Province continued to account for the largest share of the countrys nominal GDP.
However, in line with recent trends, its share in the GDP declined in 2017, contributing to narrowing of regional disparity. The Central and North Western Provinces were the second and third highest contributors to the national GDP in nominal terms.
During 2017, increases in PGDP shares could be observed in the Eastern, North Western and the Uva Provinces, while that of the Western, Southern, North Central and the Sabaragamuwa Provinces decreased.
The shares of the Central and the Northern Provinces remain unchanged.
Analysis of the economic structures within the province shows that services and activities play a dominant role in each province contributing more than 50 per cent to the PGDP, except for the Uva Province where the contribution from the services sector was 37.8 per cent.
The performance of the services and activities in each province was largely backed by the developments in wholesale and retail trade together with the expansion in transportation activities.
Provincial GDP of the Uva Province was largely driven by industry activities (44.2 per cent), for which mining and quarrying contributed significantly. In other provinces, the contributions from industry activities on PGDP varied from 16.2 to 31.5 per cent. In line with the trend observed in national GDP, contribution to PGDP from agriculture activities was the lowest in all the provinces ranging from 2.1 to 15.1 per cent.
During 2017, the Eastern Province recorded the highest share of 15.1 per cent, which was led by production of rice and marine fishing.
