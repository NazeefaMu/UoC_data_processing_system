Colombo needs at least three landfills to overcome garbage problem
The Colombo District needs at least three landfills each with a capacity of 2,000 tons per day to manage the garbage problem, Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
The minister, observing that sanitary landfills are the best cost-effective and scientific solution to the garbage issue, said Gampaha needs at least two landfills each with a capacity of 1,500 tons per day and Kalutara needs at least one with a capacity of 1,000 tons per day.
Likewise, all main cities such as Galle, Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala etc need scientifically designed sanitarylandfills he added. The minister also suggested introducing the polluter pays principle with regard to the garbage being collected.
Any scientific disposal method like incineration or waste to energy project needs Rs 7-10 per kilogram for treatment.
People must be prepared to pay. Generally it is said that one individual generates about one kilogram of garbage daily. If we charge Rs 10 per kilogram, it would be Rs 40 for a family of four, the Minister said.
The minister also said all scientists who studied and inspected the Meethotamulla dump site warned of a possible collapse.
The CMC was dumping garbage at this yard since 2009. The dumping yard which was two acres has now stretched to 21 acres. The highest point of the garbage mound is 48.5 metres. All scientists who studied and inspected the dump site warned of a possible collapse after it exceeded the height of 30 metres. The UDA repeatedly wrote to the CMC asking to stop dumping garbage at that site, but the CMC was unable to find alternative land in the face of stiff opposition of the people, he added.

Only political solution can resolve garbage crisis
Garbage issue is political, and it can be resolved only with a political solution. Some politicians do not support in finding a solution in this regard because they gain benefits from the collected waste, Frontline Socialist Party (FSP) Propaganda Secretary Pubudu Jagoda said.
Addressing a media briefing held in Colombo yesterday, he said a 2 kg of waste per person was accumulated in Colombo, while the average waste accumulation per person in the whole country should be 800g.
Referring to the gazette notification issued to make the garbage management an essential service, Jagoda said the gazette notification abolishes the right to take actions against disposing garbage since obstructing garbage garbage dumping at any place will be considered as an offence with the gazette notification.
He said dumping garbage is mainly a social class issue. The lower class population always had to suffer with the garbage issue, while politicians and the middle class did not pay attention to the end result of their collected garbage until the Meethotamulla garbage dump collapsed killing many people. The Government has to provide a sustainable solution for this issue at least by now, he said.
Jagoda said the main reason for accumulating waste unlimitedly was the over- production of goods by large-scale organisations for profits.
Arukkalu is a buffer zone of the Wilpattu sanctuary. Relocating garbage in Arukkalu will create grave issues for living beings in the area and their environment, Jagoda said.
Referring to the SAITM issue, the Propaganda Secretary said the SAITM was registered with the Colombo Stock Exchange (CSE) as a solution to the issue.
It is fake since it does not resolve the issues that the innocent students face. It is also invalid since it was taken by politicians even though the power to take such decisions are with the SAITM Board of Directors, he said.
Jagoda said well-established medical colleges worldwide are non profit entities and education must not be used as a commodity to earn profit.

Automation will wipe out two-thirds of all jobs in developing countries: WB
The World Bank estimates that two-thirds of all jobs which currently exist in developing countries will be wiped out by automation.
The Bank notes that at the same time the Internet, smart phones and social media enable everyone to see exactly how everyone else lives.
Addressing the media at the IMF head-office in Washington, World Bank President Jim Yong Kim said I see this everywhere I go.
So in the midst of these crises and with rising aspirations, we must change the way we work in development finance. We have to find new and innovative ways to reach the poor and make the world more secure and stable and to help the world grow,the World Bank Chief said.
The Bank further noted that accelerations in technology are changing the global landscape.
Kim said the global economy is high on our agenda.
We are encouraged to see stronger economic prospects after years of disappointing global growth, he said. However, we note there are still many downside risks which countries that have the fiscal space need to continue with structural reforms which are essential to accelerating sustainable and inclusive economic growth needed to end extreme poverty by 2030, the World Bank Chief noted.
He said We are meeting at a time when we face several overlapping crises, natural and manmade, all of which add urgency to our mission. We have conflicts, climate shocks, the worst refugee crisis since World War II and famine in parts of East Africa and Yemen, which the UN has called the worst in 70 years,.
He said, Heres the good news, theres never been a better time to find those win-win solutions. Theres trillions of dollars sitting on the sidelines earning little interest or even negative interest and investors are looking for better returns. That capital should be mobilised to help us meet the exploding aspirations of people all over the world. And with the crises we face, our task is much more urgent than we ever thought.
The Bank believes that globalization and free trade has had just an absolutely huge impact on poor people and poor countries. I think what you see is a reduction in inequality between countries,but increases in inequality within countries, especially OECD countries,Kim said.
We also are aware of the fact that there are many who have not benefitted from globalisation, who are very angry at the fact that they have not benefitted.
China has had the strongest experience, lifting 800 million people out of poverty, and that happened when it embraced the global market, when it opened itself to competition, when it engaged more and more in trade, the World Bank Chief said.
Kim said that trade has been an extremely important part of global economic growth, and its been an extremely important part of the reduction in poverty, the tremendous reduction in poverty we have seen over the last 30 years, Kim added.

Barkley and Lukaku uncertainty overshadow Everton's ambitions
LIVERPOOL: Doubts over the long term Everton futures of Premier League leading scorer Romelu Lukaku and midfielder Ross Barkley could ease if they beat West Ham on Saturday to all but guarantee a place in next season's Europa League.
Both Lukaku -- who tops the scoring charts with 24 goals -- and Barkley have yet to sign new contracts with the former who is tied to the club till 2019 refusing to put pen to paper on a substantially better offer.
A win at West Ham on Saturday could make qualification for the Europa League mathematically certain, depending on results elsewhere, and would be reward for a commendable first season under Ronald Koeman's management.
Koeman's side have rarely moved from seventh place since Christmas, with a run of eight successive home league wins keeping them on the tails of the top six.
Barkley, out of contract at the end of next season, has also been in the headlines for other reasons over the last fortnight.
First he was attacked in a Liverpool bar hours after the win over Leicester, and was then the subject of a deeply offensive newspaper column that has led to the publication in question, the Sun, being banned from attending all Everton matches and press conferences.
Lukaku, despite refusing to sign a new deal, has not let that affect him on the pitch.
He has scored in Everton's last nine home matches, the first player to do that since Dixie Dean in 1934.
Koeman's side could do with more points on their travels, as they have not won any of their last five away matches.
Achieve that, the manager argues, and a top-six finish is more than possible.
Seventh position means European football, he said.
But we will take up the challenge of trying to win all of our remaining games. If you do that you have a real opportunity to finish fifth or sixth, added the 54-year-old Dutchman. Midfielder James McCarthy remains out with a hamstring problem, while on-loan striker Enner Valencia is ineligible against his parent club.
West Ham could recoup 12million (14.3m euros, $15.3m) should the move become permanent but manager Slaven Bilic indicated that was by no means certain.
We are going to see what is going to happen after this season, he said. He is on a long contract with us. The Hammers are almost safe after arresting a five-game losing run with victory over Swansea and a point at Sunderland.
Bilic was mindful that his team has a habit of surrendering leads however.
In fact 22 points have been shed that way this season -- the most by any club.
It has happened more than a few times, said the 48-year-old Croatian.
We haven't used our momentum to kill games off with half an hour to go or whatever.
We should have managed those games better. Individual errors cost us but they happen, especially when opponents are taking the risk.  - AFP

Britain must pay EU divorce bill in euros
BELGIUM: Britain may be leaving the EU, but it will still have to settle the divorce bill in euros, not pounds, according to an EU document on the upcoming negotiations.
An orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the Union requires settling the financial obligations undertaken before the withdrawal date, said the European Commission document seen by AFP Thursday.
The agreement should define the precise way in which these obligations will be calculated... the obligations should be defined in euro, it added.
The document did not say how much the Brexit settlement might cost but EU officials have previously said it could be as much as 60 billion euros, sparking howls of outrage in London, which puts the figure nearer 20 billion.
Titled Non Paper on key elements likely to feature in the draft negotiating directives, the document was drawn up for the European Commission, which will conduct the Brexit negotiations with Britain.
It covers in more detail the same ground outlined last month by EU president Donald Tusk in response to Prime Minister Theresa May's official March 29 notification that Britain was leaving the bloc.
Tusk stressed then that the EU will insist on agreeing the future of citizens in Britain and the Brexit bill first before considering London's demand for a free trade pact. The Commission document outlined its aims for a reciprocal deal for EU citizens in the UK and Brits elsewhere in the bloc, saying their rights should last for the lifetime of those concerned rather than giving a cut-off date.
The Brexit divorce settlement should not just be limited to workers, the paper said, and should also apply to family members who join citizens at any point in time before/after the withdrawal date.
Residency and social security were also highlighted by the Commission as rights it will seek to protect in the two-year negotiations with London, as the two sides try to undo the mass of legislation agreed since Britain joined then European Economic Community in 1973. Both the divorce bill and the fate of EU citizens are expected to be among the toughest areas to reach agreement on, following a Brexit campaign that rallied against Britain's payments to Brussels and the number of migrants in the country.
Anticipating possible disputes, the draft paper envisaged setting up an institutional structure to ensure an effective enforcement of the commitments under the agreement, while maintaining the primacy of the European Court of Justice.
For disputes outside EU law, an alternative dispute settlement should only be envisaged if it offers equivalent guarantees of independence and impartiality as the ECJ, it added.
On a visit to London on Thursday, the head of the European parliament, Antonio Tajani, said that after Brexit, EU citizens living in the UK should have the same rights as today.
For us, it's important to ensure that Brexit does not have any negative effects on their life and the rights they are enjoying, he said, stressing that it is a priority and it is a red line.
Tajani, who also met with Prime Minister Theresa May during his visit, said Britain could still change its mind on Brexit.
If the UK wanted to stay, everybody would be in favour. I would be very happy, he said.
May, who called for snap elections for June 8 seeking to increase her slim majority before gruelling negotiations with Brussels, has said several times that there could be no turning back on Brexit. - AFP

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe yesterday assured that the government will bring a viable solution to the garbage issue soon.
The Prime Minister said that a proper plan covering the entire country is to be devised for waste management. Premier Wickremesinghe made these observations when he called on the Mahanayake Thera of the Malwatte Chapter Most Ven.Thibbotuwawe Sri Sumangala Thera in Kandy yesterday.
The government is ready to discuss with the relevant parties and the people, if implementation of waste management plans is detrimental to the environment,the Prime Minster said.

This issue is not limited to Colombo and Kollonnawa. This is a problem has engulfed the entire country,the Premier added. The Prime Minister added that certain private institutions have not started waste management projects even though they have obtained permits for such ventures.
Premier Wickremesinghe said the government will annul the licences provided to these institutions, if they fail to commence such projects within two weeks.
Such projects have not been commenced in many districts including Kandy, Galle, Matara.
The Prime Minister added that a Japanese team has inspected the garbage dumping site at Meethtamulla and their report is expected next week. In addition, a World Bank team, a local team and Swedish team have inspected the area. The government will obtain their observations, the Premier said.

D.B. Welagedara: Humble hero
D.B. Welagedara is a name that dwells in the hearts of the people of Kurunegala. That is because of the memorable services he has rendered to them during a period spanning a half century.
It is 28 years since his demise. The D.B. Welagedara Commemorative Society will meet today, at 8.30 a.m., at the Welagedara memorial on Colombo Road, Kurunegala to revere his memory. This year too, as usual, there will be almsgiving, other meritorious activities and donations of spectacles and equipment to facilitate the mobility of the handicapped. The award of D.B. Welagedara scholarships too, will take place at the time.
D.B. Welagedara was born on October 31, 1915, at Panaliya, Polgahawela, as the only son in a renowned family of the area.
He had his education at Ananda and Nalanda Colleges in Colombo and at St. John's College in Jaffna. He then joined the Law College of Sri Lanka to his law studies, and at the end of his studies, he joined the administration of the country as a Divisional Revenue Officer, a member of the first batch of such officers who replaced the Rate Mahathmayas who were holding office at the time. He was elected the president of the Divisional Revenue Officers' Association.
He was outstanding in rendering service to the rural people. At their insistence, he resigned from the public service, sacrificing his pension to contest the snap general election of 1952. He was elected the MP for Kurunegala, defeating no less a person than Queens Counsel H. Sri Nissanka, stalwart in the political arena.
Welagedara was dedicated to serving the public as Mayor, Member of Parliament, Deputy Minister, Cabinet Minister, and Provincial Governor, right to the day he passed away. His services in this regards was mainly in the fields of education, health, transport, agriculture, and religion, but not restricted to them.
He was exemplary in his conduct and was a model to be emulated.
His most outstanding quality was his punctuality. Once having accepted an invitation to be the chief guest of a school ceremony, he visited the school at the exact time indicated to find that the ceremony would not start after delay. In case of delay, in resentment, he left the school after advising the principal to train schoolchildren to work on time. He was keen to follow to the letter the Buddhist way of living. His position was that he did not need any additional protection as he was protected by the Triple Gem. He functioned as the Secretary of the Mahiyangana Chaithya Renovation Society, when Prime Minister D.S. Senanayake was the chairman of that society, followed by his son, Dudley Senanayake.
His last request reflects his Buddhist traditional values. It was as follows:
Request made to my relatives and friends:
Death, just as birth, is common to all beings, including myself. It cannot be avoided. No purpose will be served by grieving.
My eyes should be used to provide vision to a person who could make use of them.
My body should be given over to a hospital or research institution that could make use of it for the benefit of others.
If I have done any wrong to you, bury its memory forever."
(The remains of Welagedara were handed over to the Sri Lanka Medical College, whilst the eyes were handed over to the Eye Donation Society of Sri Lanka). King Dutugemunu who vanquished king Elara, had much respect for the latter. He ordained that any person passing by the tomb of Elara, should pay homage to his memorial. Welagedara too, had these inimitable virtues. He named a school started by him as H. Sri Nissanka Vidyalaya, being the name of a political rival. The inaugural entry in the log book of the Maliyadeva Model School, a school that Piyadasa Wijesinghe planned to start and effectively completed by Welagedara, is an order by him that Piydasa Wijesinghe should be invited for all ceremonies of the school. These examples illustrate his qualities.
Welagedara took pride in his being a Sinhala and a villager. He believed that if any person remembers the Buddha first and noble Sinhala kings like Parakramabahu and Dutugemunu. That person refrains from adopting the wicked practices of the foreigners. He is bound to prosper. His practices reflected this philosophy. He moved in regal circles, but never forgot his rural background nor did he forsake his bond with the common man.
All his efforts were directed at making a
bath korale (a rice bowl) out of Sath Korale. He was an experienced farmer too. His example induced others to take to cultivation. A tree planting campaign was an indispensable item in any birthday celebration for him. His policy was that a tree should be planted for every tree uprooted.
His adorable qualities are the gifts he left to us on taking leave of us.
May D.B. Welagedara attain supreme bliss of Nibbana!

Europe is not going to be a favourable market for Sri Lanka in future with political changes taking place in many countries in the European Union, Megapolis and Western Development Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said yesterday.
He said although the country received the GSP plus facility, there would be little use of it. The country would be urged to find alternative foreign markets for the country's exports, he said.
"2017 is a significant year for politics in Europe. It would affect Sri Lankan Exports as well," the minister said.
"The two main political parties in France have not been able to bring their candidates to the presidential election. This failure will have its effects on global politics and economy," he said.
The minister said a General Election has been called for in the UK this year. It is expected that the Conservative party will gain the victory. The election to elect the German President will be held in September, he said.

Feasibility study to link railway from Mahawa to Puttalam
A feasibility study will be conducted on the possibility of having a new railway link from Mahawa to Puttalam connecting the Northern and Puttalam Railway lines, Sri Lanka Railways (SLR) General Manager B.A.P. Ariyaratne told the Daily News.
He said the proposed railway line is 80 kms. The railway track will serve the dual purpose of passenger transport as well as transporting of coal to the Norochcholai power plant. The project will lead to a transport boon and a rapid development of the area, including a boon to tourism and agricultural development of the North-Western Province. He said since transporting coal by roads is costly and creates adverse environmental impacts, this is the suitable option for all sectors.
Ariyaratne said the SLR is in talks with the Ceylon Electricity Board to implement the project.
"We have to increase the transport of goods by trains. We have signed an MOU with the Prima Company to transport flour from Trincomalee harbour to Seeduwa. Special railway engines and transporting wagons will be purchased by the Prima Company for flour transportation," he said.
According to Ariyarathne, the Railways Department will Rs. 15 million per month by flour transportation.
"We have planned to transport more coal by trains. We have a deal with Holcim Lanka to transport coal by rail from the eastern port of Trincomalee to Mahawa. Coal imported by Holcim is being sent by rail from the China Bay station in Trincomalee to the Mahawa railway station. This has resulted in increasing revenue to the SLR from freight transport," Ariyaratne said.
He said fuel transportation via trains will be increased.
"We are working together with CPC to distribute fuel by trains isladwide which is more beneficial for the SLR and the CPC as it is more cost effective. Four trains travel daily to the BIA carrying fuel required by flights," he said.
He said it is difficult to make the SLR more profitable as many concessions have been provided to various sectors in society.
"We only charge 15 percent of the value of the ticket fare from the public servants and only 5 percent from schoolchildren. Even on long distant trains, the fare is less than 40 percent of the corresponding bus fares, Ariyaratne said.

First coal-free day in Britain since Industrial Revolution

Britain went a full day without using coal to generate electricity for the first time since the Industrial Revolution, the National Grid says.
The energy provider said Friday's lack of coal usage was a "watershed" moment.
Britain's longest continuous energy period without coal until now was 19 hours - first achieved last May, and again on Thursday.
The government plans to phase out Britain's last plants by 2025 in order to cut carbon emissions.
Friday is thought to be the first time the nation has not used coal to generate electricity since the world's first centralised public coal-fired generator opened in 1882, at Holborn Viaduct in London.
Cordi O'Hara of the National Grid said: "To have the first working day without coal since the start of the industrial revolution is a watershed moment in how our energy system is changing.
"The UK benefits from highly diverse and flexible sources of electricity. Our energy mix continues to change and National Grid adapts system operation to embrace these changes."
But O'Hara says that while the country makes the transition to a low carbon system, coal remains an important source of energy.
According to Gridwatch.co.uk, around half of British energy on Friday came from natural gas, with about a quarter coming from nuclear plants.
Wind, biomass, and imported energy were also used.

Former NFL star Hernandez hangs himself in prison
Convicted murderer and former NFL star Aaron Hernandez was found hanged in his Massachusetts prison cell Wednesday morning, just days after his acquittal in a double murder case.
The 27-year-old former tight end for the New England Patriots hanged himself with a bedsheet attached to a window in his cell at the Souza-Baranowski Correctional Center in Shirley, the Massachusetts Department of Correction said. His body was discovered at 3:05 a.m.
Lifesaving techniques were attempted on Mr. Hernandez, and he was transported to UMass Leominster, where he was pronounced dead at 4:07 a.m., the correction departments statement reads.
Hernandez, who was serving a life sentence, was alone in his cell in a general population wing and had attempted to block his door from the inside by jamming the door with various items, the statement reads.
Massachusetts State Police are investigating his death. The Office of the Chief Medical Examiner is conducting an autopsy to determine the cause and manner of death, the Worcester County district attorneys office said.
Jose Baez, an attorney for Hernandez, has been retained by the athletes family to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death and will act as the executor of his estate, according to a statement from Baez.
The family and legal team is shocked and surprised at the news of Aarons death, Baez said in the statement. There were no conversations or correspondence from Aaron to his family or legal team that would have indicated anything like this was possible.
Aaron was looking forward to an opportunity for a second chance to prove his innocence.
Those who love and care about him are heartbroken and determined to find the truth surrounding his untimely death.
His death marks one of the most dramatic falls from grace by an athlete in recent memory, and comes the same day that many of his former teammates visit the White House as Super Bowl champions.
A LIFE SENTENCE FOR ODIN LLOYD MURDER
Hernandezs life sentence was for his conviction of first-degree murder in the 2013 killing of Odin Lloyd, a semipro football player who was dating the sister of Hernandezs fiance.
A jogger found Lloyds gunshot-riddled body in a Massachusetts industrial park less than a mile from Hernandezs home on June 17, 2013. Hernandez was charged with murder nine days later, and the Patriots released him.
He was found guilty in April 2015 and sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.
This is a shocking and sad end to a very tragic series of events that has negatively impacted a number of families, said Bristol County District Attorney Thomas Quinn, who prosecuted the Lloyd case.
In May 2014, prosecutors charged Hernandez with two murder counts in the July 2012 deaths of Safiro Furtado and Daniel de Abreu, two men who were killed in a drive-by shooting outside a Boston nightclub.
Hernandez was found not guilty last Friday of two counts of murder in that case, though he was convicted of illegal possession of a firearm.
Hernandez was visibly emotional when the verdicts were read, embracing his attorneys.
You could tell that he was relieved as well, Ronald Sullivan Jr., his defense attorney, said after the verdict. He was charged for something somebody else did, and that is a weighty burden for anyone to shoulder.
Despite the acquittal, the families of Furtado and de Abreu still believe Hernandez is responsible for their deaths, lawyer William Kennedy said. They are considering whether to proceed with a civil case against the estate. The case had been on hold pending the outcome of the criminal case.
Through a Creole translator, Furtados father, Salvatore Furtado, said he took no joy in Hernandezs death. But he still wants accountability for the lives of his son and his friend, whom were often reduced to their professions -- cleaners -- in reports on the trial.
They were more than cleaners, Kennedy said. They were good people who deserved to live and that was robbed from them and the companionship was robbed from their families.
With the acquittal, Hernandezs attorneys had turned their attention toward appealing for a new trial in the Lloyd case. As recently as Tuesday, Baez said he was optimistic about getting that case overturned.
Knowing what I know about Aaron, and knowing Aaron, theres a good chance that perhaps we can get that reversed, the lawyer told CNN then.
FOOTBALL CAREER DOGGED BY ALLEGATIONS
Hernandezs arrest cut short what had been a promising football career burgeoning on stardom, beginning in his hometown of Bristol, Connecticut.
From there, he caught passes from Tim Tebow at the University of Florida and was a key contributor to that teams 2008 national championship.
Hernandez then became the first Gator to win the John Mackey Award, given annually to the NCAAs best tight end.
But Hernandez was dogged by allegations of failed drug tests and was picked by the Patriots in the fourth round of the 2010 NFL Draft.
Still, with future Hall of Famer Tom Brady throwing to him, Hernandez shined for New England.
The Patriots rewarded him in 2012 with a five-year contract extension worth up to $40 million.
In all, Hernandez spent more time in prison than on the field with the Patriots.
Stacey James, a spokesman for the Patriots, said the team was aware of the news but did not anticipate any comment.
Mike Pouncey, a teammate at Florida, posted a photo of Hernandez on Instagram and said they had just talked to each other the day before.
To my friend my brother! Through thick and thin right or wrong we never left each others side, Pouncey wrote. Today my heart hurts as I got the worse news I could have imagined.
It was just a day ago we shared our last convo. I will forever miss you and love you bro.
Hernandez is survived by his fiance, Shayanna Jenkins-Hernandez, and their 4-year-old daughter.
As Hernandez waited last week during jury deliberations, he waved and blew kisses to his daughter in the courtroom.

Garbage mafia on the decline : 3Rs To the rescue
It is time we shelve Not in my backyard, but somewhere else attitude on garbage and support the efforts to deal with the issue in a scientific manner, Western Development and Megapolis Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said. Maintaining that sanitary landfills are the best cost-effective and scientific solution for garbage issue in Sri Lanka, the minister pointed out the Colombo District alone needs three landfills with a capacity of 2,000 tons per day. In an interview with the Daily News the minister also spoke about the garbage mafia, and how the Kolonnawa garbage pile had become a treasure trove to some.
Q: The President said he would appoint a commission on the Meethotamulla incident. Appointing commission after commission was the practice of the previous Government. How do you take that this Government is also following the same footsteps
A: Meethotamulla incident has given rise to various implications, misinterpretations and mudslinging campaigns. I think an impartial inquiry will help to ascertain the truth. The people of this country as well as the political leadership will be able to get a better picture of the situation and this will help to take right decisions to avoid these kinds of tragedies happening again.
Q: Do you accept that Meethotamulla disaster is a man-made disaster that could have been averted
A: Definitely.
Q: What do you think the Government should do to tackle the latest situation in the country in the aftermath of Meethotamulla disaster
A: To take the situation in hand we should declare waste management as an essential service. Not only the CMC, after Meethotamulla disaster, many local bodies such as Kaduwela, Maharagama, Biyagama, Kolonnawa and Kotikawatte have no place to dump their garbage. Many private companies engaged in garbage collection too dumped their garbage to Meethotamulla. Now they are in trouble. The problem is that we do not have a solid legal institution to deal with garbage.
The Government, at this point, has no option, but to dump the garbage somewhere. There is no other solution at hand. People are always up in arms and these agitations cannot be tolerated anymore. Not in my backyard attitude of the people should go. The society must be sensitive to this issue and let the issue be dealt in a scientific manner.
Q: What are the major obstacles that stand in the way of resolving garbage issue in Sri Lanka
A: The garbage problem here in Sri Lanka could not be solved because of three main reasons. They are the social attitude, legal matters and financial restraints.
Not in my backyard, do it somewhere else is the kind of attitude people show every time when someone tries to come up with a scientific solution to the garbage issue. From politicians to ordinary people, all are up in arms against such projects. People also tend to neglect the individual responsibility. When Pradeshiya Sabha or Town Council ask the people to segregate waste, they do not do that, but simply complain later over the garbage problem.
The legal issue is because of various institutions are involved in waste management. As per the law, local government bodies are primarily responsible for garbage collecting, disposal and other related matters. Unfortunately, some local authorities like the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) are unable to handle their own waste. In provincial wise, some like the Western Provincial Council have their own Waste Management Authorities. In addition, Pilisaru Project of the Central Environmental Authority (CEA) also handles garbage. The Provincial Councils and Local Government Ministry too deals with the same subject. Hence, we now need a centralized waste management authority. It must be a comprehensive single arm like the Water Board, Electricity Board or the Urban Development Authority.
Above all, the financial aspect matters. We are talking about waste to energy projects, landfills and incineration, but money matters in all of them. If you are going to adopt a scientific disposal method like incineration or waste to energy project using any other technology, you need to spend Rs 7-10 per kilogram for treatment. People should be prepared to pay.
Generally it is said that one individual generates about one kilogram of garbage daily. If we charge Rs 10 per kilogram, it would be Rs 40 for a family of four. In my experience, I know this proposal will not be taken in the right spirit by many. It may be dubbed as kunu badda (garbage tax). For instance, when I was trying to introduce Rs 5,000 fine for garbage dumping on roadsides, I was called a kunu amathi (garbage minister.) These kinds of problems are there, but if we are to solve this problem we need money.
Q: In your view what is the best solution for garbage issue in Colombo
A: Colombo has a population of about 650,000, but over one million people commute to the city daily as it is the capital of Sri Lanka. Over 600 tons of garbage is collected daily within the municipality. There are no lands in and around Colombo to dump them. All available lands are marshy lands. Lands are available only in outstation areas.
In my opinion, sanitary landfills are the best cost-effective and scientific solution for garbage issue. I was instrumental in putting up a scientific landfill in Kirindiwella in Dompe when I was the Environment Minister. Everyone was opposed to me, but I managed to go ahead. I am thankful for my successors for completing it. Now, anybody can visit the area and see whether there is any environmental harm from it as claimed. The Colombo District alone needs three landfills with a capacity of 2,000 tons per day. Gampaha needs at least two landfills with a capacity of 1,500 tons per day and Kalutara needs at least one with a capacity of 1,000 tons per day. Likewise, all main cities such as Galle, Matara, Kandy, Kurunegala etc need scientifically designed sanitary landfills.
City planning is not merely constructing jogging tracks. Having a beautiful living room in a house is of no value if the kitchen and toilets are full of litter. Same applies to Colombo.
If we have the financial capacity, we can also opt for incineration. Incinerators are a tested but high end technology used in waste management.
Q: Despite how much we talk about sustainable development, poor attention has been paid to waste management and related matters. The Government allocates little money for the purpose. Do you agree with this claim
A: Money is one key factor that acts as a restraint, but in my view the main problem is the social attitude. Many politicians are scared to handle this issue because of the political price attached with it. A fine example was how Karu Jayasuriya had to pay a political price for coming forward to initiate Meepe landfill with World Bank funds in 1997 when he was the Mayor of Colombo. There was a protest campaign bearing the slogan Meepe dont need Colombos garbage, and in the 1999 Provincial Council elections there was a sinister plan to defeat Karu Jayasuriya, who was the UNP Chief Ministerial candidate. He was defeated by 9,000 votes. The Bloemendhal garbage dump was the ultimate result of that campaign.
Lack of Government allocations is also a problem. Political authorities tend to give more prominence for instant work to show off the people. There must be a strong political will to solve the garbage problem.
Q: It is widely accused that the garbage handling is riddled with corruption and garbage dumps are treasure troves to some. Your views
A: In fact, stinking Kolonnawa garbage pile equals to a sweet-scented flower bed to some. For example the weighing machine at the yard, has always broken down. If they claim to have accepted 900 tons per day from the CMC, the actual weight could have been something around 600 tons. The money for the rest of 300 tons goes elsewhere. Private companies which are involved in garbage collection too dump their garbage in Meethotamulla. All these monies are not recorded.
Some people make a lot of money out of this garbage dump and they are not ready to shift it. When we decided to immediately stop dumping garbage at Meethotamulla in the aftermath of the disaster, there were people against.
In the same way, when the decision that no more garbage should be dumped at Bloemendhal was made when I was the Environment Minister, we were threatened by underworld leaders. We could not send any official. We had to deploy the STF to implement the decision.
This garbage mafia is very powerful and it is a long standing thing. They are earning at least Rs 1 million per day. One lady at a leading company that handles garbage told me that they have to pay at least Rs 300 million per annum to do the business.
Q: What are the waste management plans under the Western Region Megapolis Project
A: We will not hand over waste generated from the Colombo Port City or any other proposed city such as the tech city or service city to the CMC. We will build up an incinerator and also a scientific landfill in Muthurajawela to dispose waste generated from these new cities.
Q: Dont you think it is timely we introduce new regulations pertaining to the use of polythene and plastic and waste disposal
A: Definitely, it is a must. We need a c
omprehensive and composite programme for that purpose. The 3R principle (Reduce, Reuse, Recycle) should be strictly adopted. Clinical waste and electronic waste must be handled separately. The bio-degradable waste can be converted into compost fertilizer or sent to incinerators. The cost-effective solution is the landfill.
Q: The Joint Opposition claimed the tug-of-war between Western Province Chief Minister Isura Devapriya and you hindered the space to find a solution to garbage issue. Comment
A: Some people are trying to use the Meethotamulla incident as a political football and try to make character assassinations. That is pathetic.
Towards the end of 2015, the Cabinet asked the UDA to go for international bidding process for waste management in Gampaha and Karadiyana. A total of 122 applications (103 local companies and 19 foreign companies) were received for the paper advertisement that was put up for this purpose. Four companies were selected to carry out the project in Karadiyana and three companies to carry out the project in Gampaha. All the selections were made above board adhering to proper standards. Thereafter the projects were handed over to the Western Provincial Council on March 10.
Talking about the history of Meethotamulla, garbage collected from the CMC was dumped at this yard since 2009. Initially, the CMC received the permission of the court only for six months, but it continued beyond that. The dumping yard which was 2 acres has now stretched to 21 acres. About one million square meters of garbage is there in this marshy land. The highest point of the garbage mount is 48.5 meters. All scientists who studied and inspected the dump site warned of a possible collapse after it exceeded the height of 30 meters. That is why the UDA repeatedly wrote to the CMC asking to stop dumping garbage at that site, but the CMC was unable to find alternative land in the face of stiff opposition of the people.
Q: Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa said Meethotamulla tragedy could have been prevented had the Government implemented his plans to shift the CMC garbage to Aruwakkalu in Puttalam. What are your thoughts in this regard
A: We are grateful that the previous administration led by former President Rajapaksa came up with that proposal, but let me also note that it received the Cabinet approval as late as August 2014. The impression given by the former President that the money had been allocated and the project was about to be launched was wrong.
However, that plan was good. That area had many abandoned quarries, from which limestone had been extracted by the Holcim Company to produce cement. The proposal was to put up a landfill there. During the Environmental Impact Assessment (EIA), the Wildlife Conservation Department opposed the project on the grounds of environmental concerns because it came within the Wilpattu buffer zone.
Personally, I could not agree with this argument as the environmental damage from that proposed project was minimal compared to Meethotamulla, but still we listened to it. Now we have managed to find another location in Puttalam and the EIA is underway for the project. We assume the responsibility of undertaking this project and it will be completed by two years. I urge everybody not to come up with the slogan We do not want Colombos garbage to Puttalam because such slogans would only lead to more and more garbage dumps like Meethotamulla.

Govt attempting to make people responsible for Meethotamulla tragedy: JVP
The government that dumped garbage in densely populated areas in Colombo is trying to make the people responsible for the tragedy at Meethotamulla, Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna Parliamentarian Vijita Herath said yesterday.
He said the two main political parties which governed the country for 69 years did not find a viable solution for the garbage issue.
He made these observations at a press conference at the JVP Political Head Office in Pelawatta, Battaramulla yesterday. "Garbage dumping in Meethotamulla began in 2008 by the then government," Herath said. "Until then, garbage in the Kolonnawa Municipal Council was dumped at Meethotamulla," he said.
Herath said Gotabaya Rajapaksa threatened the people using Police and dumped garbage at Meethotamulla. "The garbage dumped by Rajapaksas is at Meethotamulla," he said.
He said it was only the JVP that objected the motion of the Kolonnawa Municipal Council to dump garbage of Colombo at Meethotamulla.
He said the garbage management was managed by the JVP at the Tissamaharama Pradeshiya Sabha when it was in power. He said the Rajapaksa government disrupted it.

Legal action against public, private sector heads: For Dengue larvae found in premises
Legal action will be taken against the heads of public and private institutions, if dengue larvae is found in their premises, Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Minister Rajitha Senarathne said.
If a dengue breeding ground is found in school premises, legal action will be taken against the principal of that particular school, he said.
According to the Minister, the government has taken this policy decision aiming to curtail the spread of dengue fever.
The Minister was addressing the media at the Health Ministry Auditorium yesterday.
Minister Senaratne added that officers attached to the Environmental Police, Public Health Inspectors together with Health Ministry launched a countrywide exercise to eradicate dengue. In line with this move, the Health Ministry is going to introduce a hotline number to receive complaints on the dengue eradication process.

Monthly allowance for evacuated families
The Government yesterday decided to pay a monthly allowance of Rs.50,000 to each family evacuated from the high risk area around the Meethotamulla garbage dump on the instructions of President Maithripala Sirisena, Disaster Management Ministry Secretary S.S. Miyanawala said.
He said about 150-160 families would receive the monthly allowance for a period of three months. The allowance is provided for the evacuated families to rent a house until permanent houses are provided.
Families who were given permanent houses in the housing complexes coming under the Urban Development Authority would not be entitled to this payment.
President Sirisena directed the officials to implement a programme to solve the solid waste management issue in the country and further instructed to formulate necessary arrangements to vest power with a Central Authority in that process.
The President gave these instructions during a meeting at the Disaster Management Ministry to review the progress of providing relief measures to the Meethotamulla victims, yesterday.
The programme to provide houses for the displaced persons, whose houses were completely destroyed, was launched yesterday under the guidance of the President, expediting the resettlement process for the people affected by the collapse of a section of the Meethotamulla garbage dump. The President also directed the Secretary to the President to take actions to call regular discussions with the participation of Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers and other officials till solutions are found to the current issues. These discussions will be held before the Cabinet meeting.
It was decided at this meeting to provide Rs.250,000 to each family for furniture and other and another sum of Rs.10,000 for transportation purposes.
At the same meeting, the President instructed the authorities to formulate a mechanism to solve the garbage issue. He also instructed that a Central Authority also be set up with the necessary powers.
It was also decided to pay a monthly allowance of Rs.50,000 to those families who are living in the vulnerable areas and another Rs 10,000 to transport their furniture until permanent compensation is paid. The related ministries have agreed to provide houses or estimated compensation to those victims in the vulnerable areas within three months under the instructions of the President and Prime Minister. Members of 60 families whose houses were completely damaged, 22 families whose houses were partially damaged and 211 families whose houses are located in vulnerable areas would get these benefits.
According to a decision reached at the same meeting the housing loans that had been obtained from the Housing Development Authority to construct their houses in this area including the vulnerable area will be written off.
At the same meeting, the Prime Minister pointed out the need for a national policy on disposal of garbage and it was decided to hold a weekly meeting headed by the President for this purpose
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, Ministers Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Susil Premajayantha, Patali Champika Ranawaka, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Faizer Mustafa, Sagala Rathnayake, Vajira Abeywardena, A.

Moratuwas all-round sportsman Nimal Fernando
Former Moratu Vidyalaya athletic and volleyball captain, cricketer and soccer player, Air Lanka and Police athlete and Ceylon athlete and Retired Senior Superintendent of Police Nimal Fernando spoke to the Daily News about his school, Air Lanka and Police sports career at his residence at 137, Sirisanda, Galle Road, Moratuwa.
Q : What is your full name, date of birth and your first school
A - My full name is Merennege Chandra Nimal Fernando and I was born on 23 October 1939 at my ancestral house in Moratuwa. I had my entire education at Moratu Maha Vidyalaya and during my whole career my Principal was A. M. de Silva. I entered college in 1945 and left in 1958.
Q : Who are your parents and something about your family
A - My father is Merennege Justin Fernando and during his heyday he was a fine tennis player and my mother is Grace Victoria Fernando. My father was a Post Master and my mother is a housewife. My elder brother late Nihal Fernando, younger brother Mohanlal and younger sister Srimathie were all doctors.
Q : How did you commence your athletic career
A - My forte is athletics. I captained the college volleyball team and represented my alma-mater at cricket and soccer and I won colours in all four sports. During my period we had Junior Cadeting but I was not much interested. We were living very close proximity to our college not even 100 yards. Those days our school commenced at 8.00 a.m. and closed at 3.00 p.m. and most of the time I was at the grounds with my school friends.
Q : How did you commence athletics
A - I was really interested in athletics. I started from under ten and I was the under 12, 14, 16 and under 19 athletic champion. I started with 75 yards and 100 yards and later I did 200, 400 yards and high jump. When I was 16 years our prefect of games Mr. Ranasuriya introduced pole vault at school. I took up to pole vault, 400 and high jump. At the Western Group South Meet I became champion for two consecutive years in 1957 and 1958. I set a meet record in pole vault in 1958 and that record is still unbroken. We won the 110x4 and 440x4 yards relays and our relay team consisted of Lakshman de Alwis, Gamini Perera, Linton Perera and myself.
Q : Did you take part at Public Schools
A - Yes. But I could win only the 400 yards flat race. I was awarded Public Schools Colours.
Q : After leaving school what was your first employment
A - I joined Air Lanka and during this period the Ceylon athletic team was invited for the Invitation Malaysian Championship in 1960 and our captain was A. S. M. Khan. We were the runner-up in the 4x440 relay and I came second in the 400 yards. I won the Ceylon athletic colours. In 1962 I joined the Police Department as a Sub Inspector.
Q : Did you take part for the Police in athletics
A - I did 400, pole vault and 400 meters hurdles. Late DIG Arthur Dep used to come to the Police grounds to help the Police athletes at the Police Park and seeing me participating in the hurdles he advised me to concentrate on that event. He gave me the finer points.
Q : What are your achievements in athletics at Police
A - I was the champion athlete in 1963 and 1964 at the Inter Division Police Meet. I did 400, Pole Vault and 400 meters Hurdles. I was awarded Knollys Shield and I erased the record of Duncan Whites record 56.1 seconds by clocking 56.3 secs at the Police Meet in 1964. Later I clocked 51.3 secs and this record is unbroken for the last 54 years.
In the 400 meters I bettered Duncan Whites record at the Jaffna AAV versus CT&FC Meet in Jaffna. There are several records under my belt. I was the fifth runner-up to Michael Tissera at the Sports Star of the Year Contest sponsored by Horlicks.
Q: You said you won the Knollys Shield
A - I won it twice. Since 1902 todate Police have named sixteen great stalwarts in athletics for their National Achievements and I am one of them.
Since the inauguration of the Police Meet 59 policemen have won the Knolleys Shield which is awarded to the Best
Athlete of the Meet and I won it twice in 1963 and 1964. The oldest record for the Police Inter Division Athletic Meet is still unbroken - the 400 meters hurdles established by me in 1963.
Q : Recently the Police had the Inter Division Athletic Meet and were you invited
A - For the last 54 years I was invited for this meet because I am the holder of the 400 meters hurdles record. In 2009 at the 75th Police Athletic Meet (Diamond Jubilee) I was awarded a memento for the outstanding contribution made to Police athletics by the Police Sports Club.
Myself, Lakshman de Alwis, Senaka Wijenayake all three Moratuwites founded the Ceylonese Track and Field Club and our first President was B. R. de Silva. In the Dual Athletic Meet with Ace Athletic Club in 1961, Senaka, Lakshman, Airman K. C. Perera and myself set a new Ceylon record for 4x440 yards with a timing of 3 minutes 22.7 seconds.
Q : You mentioned earlier that you played soccer, volleyball and cricket whilst at school
A - Yes. I was a left arm medium pace opening bowler for three successive years in the first eleven team. I played soccer for the first eleven and I captained the volleyball team and we were the District champions in 1956/57. In 1958 in the All Island finals for the Lankadeepa Trophy we lost to Gampaha District.
Q : What is your advice to up and coming young athletes
A - Not only athletes every one should be disciplined initially. During my Police career I have met a lot of learned people and most of them are not disciplined. Next comes the studies and finally you must do a sport so that you will be a balanced person.

Olympic champ Rollins banned for whereabouts rule violation
LOS ANGELES: Reigning Olympic 100m hurdles champion Brianna Rollins has been handed a one-year suspension for failing to properly file whereabouts information for out-of-competition testing, the US Anti-Doping Agency (USADA) said Thursday.
Her punishment includes loss of all results retroactive to September 27, 2016, the date of her last missed whereabouts report, but doesn't affect the Rio gold won by Rollins.
The ban would keep her out of this year's IAAF World Championships in August at London.
USADA said in a statement that the 25-year-old athlete, who led a US podium sweep of the 100m hurdles at the Rio Games, received three whereabouts failures over the course of 12 months, which constitutes a doping rule violation.
Rollins did complete eight out-of-competition tests over the course of 2016 and did not test positive.
She also passed all eight in-competition drug tests she took last year.
But Rollins was unavailable for tests on April 27, September 13 and September 27, for reasons that appear in the written report by the panel from the American Arbitration Association that heard her appeal to be mix-ups.
A statement released by her representatives said at least one of the missed tests was the result of confusion over the computer program used to give whereabouts to drug testing officials.
While the panel found that a violation had indeed occurred, in their written decision they noted that the case involved the imposition of a serious penalty on a brilliant athlete who is not charged or suspected of using banned substances of any kind. This is a first offense, she had been frequently tested for years, and she has a perfect drug-free record, both in and out-of-competition, the panel said of Rollins. Her clean tests included an out-of-competition test on May 3, 2016 (six days after Incident One) and an out-of-competition test on October 14, 2016 (31 and 17 days, respectively, after Incidents Two and Three). The arbitrators added that Rollins showed no evidence of avoiding testing, masking drug use, or using drugs. The abitrators noted that two of the violations came after Rollins' Rio victory, when she was traveling in one instance to her home state of Florida to be honored and in another to be received by US President Barack Obama, honors that could reasonably distract her from her quotidian (though important) responsibilities. They ruled that Rollins had shown the least degree of fault and therefore made her suspension for one year only, the least allowable penalty.
It is with my deepest regrets that I will have to miss the 2017 outdoor season, Rollins said in a statement. I accept full responsibility for the mistakes that have led to my suspension, and am disappointed that I will have to miss this coming outdoor season, as a result of my confusion over how the whereabouts program worked.
I have always been and continue to be a supporter of USADA and their fight to keep our sport clean, and I will continue to do my part to prove that success can be achieved without taking any shortcuts ... I will accept the sanction and work to prepare myself for my return in 2018.

Pentagon chief warns Syria against using chemical weapons
ISRAEL: US Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said during a visit to Israel on Friday there can be no doubt Syria has retained some chemical weapons and warned President Bashar al-Assad's regime not to use them.
Mattis made the comments as he began a one-day visit for talks with Israeli leaders, who strongly supported the recent US strike against an airbase in neighbouring Syria over an alleged chemical attack on a rebel-held town.
The bottom line is there can be no doubt in the international community's mind that Syria has retained chemical weapons in violation of its agreement and its statement that it had removed them all, Mattis said during a press conference with Israeli Defence Minister Avigdor Lieberman.
It's a violation of the United Nations Security Council resolutions, and it's going to have to be taken up diplomatically, and they'd be ill-advised to try to use any again. We've made that very clear with our strike. Mattis added that Syria had dispersed their aircraft in recent days. An Israeli military assessment has found that Assad's regime was still in possession of a few tonnes of chemical weapons, an army official confirmed.
Some Israeli media reports put the number at between one and three tonnes. Lieberman declined to comment on the assessment at Friday's press conference.
Assad, backed by his ally Russia, has strongly denied the allegation that his forces used chemical weapons against the rebel-held town of Khan Sheikhun on April 4, describing it as a 100 percent fabrication.
He has said repeatedly that his forces turned over all chemical weapons stockpiles in 2013, under a deal brokered by Russia to avoid threatened US military action. The agreement was later enshrined in a UN Security Council resolution. Mattis was later holding talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Jerusalem, followed by President Reuven Rivlin.
Israel and the United States have long had close strategic ties, with Washington providing Israel more than $3 billion per year in defence aid and President Donald Trump pledging unstinting support for the country. Despite tensions over Israeli settlement building, Barack Obama's administration signed a new agreement with Israel before he left office increasing the amount to $3.8 billion for a 10-year period beginning in 2018. Mattis hopes to hear directly from Israeli leaders on their concerns and what they expect from the Trump administration, a US defence official said.
Iran's influence is at the top of the list for Israel, a worry shared by the United States. Trump has denounced Iran's harmful influence in the Middle East. Israel is closely watching Iran's presence in Syria, where it is backing Assad.
Israeli enemy Hezbollah is also fighting with Assad in Syria. Israel fought a devastating war against the Iran-backed Lebanese Shiite movement in 2006.
Israel has sought to avoid being dragged into the six-year civil war in Syria, but acknowledges carrying out air strikes there to stop what it says are deliveries of advanced weapons to Hezbollah. Last month, in the most serious incident between the two countries since the Syria conflict began, Israeli warplanes struck several targets there, drawing retaliatory missile fire. - AFP

A discussion on generating power using small hydro power plants, was held under the patronage of President Maithripala Sirisena at the Presidential Secretariat on Thursday.
Attention was drawn to issues such as identifying the possibility of increasing the 340 megawatt added to the national electricity grid by small hydro power plants to 550 megawatt, recognising the challenges faced by the Small Hydro Power Developers when implementing development strategies for the respective field, ascertaining the new methods to achieve national goals of generating renewable energy and implementing the development activities ensuring environmental balance. President Sirisena said the utilisation of modern technology should be considered when issuing licences for small hydro power plants.
He said steps should be taken to solve issues by appointing committees in State institutions after identifying projects with problems.
Officials, including Mahaweli Development and Environment Ministry Secretary Udaya R. Seneviratne and Small Hydro Power Developers Association members participated.

Roger Federer not certain of competing at French Open
Will he Won't he Roger Federer has cast an element of doubt over whether he will compete in the tennis season's second grand slam -- next month's French Open.
The Swiss great told CNN Sport that missing the second major of the year to extend his current break from the Tour was "still an option right now" and he will make a firm decision just before the French Open starts.
Federer, who missed six months of last season with a knee injury, surprised the tennis world in March by announcing he would take eight weeks off to recover from a fairytale start to the year.
At 35, and having won the three biggest titles of the year to date -- the Australian Open, Indian Wells and the Miami Open -- the 18-time grand slam champion decided he needed to rest and would return to action two weeks before the start of the French Open on May 22.
But Federer, who has won the French Open once, in 2009, told CNN Sport: "I don't think I will skip it, but I will have to see in, say, four or five weeks how I feel when I get on the clay, how my mood is.
"If I feel like I'm not 100% in it, that I'm (not) really fired up -- and I believe that is something possible -- then it is better to skip it.
"But then I think maybe the break is a long one. It will be 10 weeks until the grass -- that could be a bit long, but I will make a definite decision in five weeks. But I think I will play the French."
FEDERER NOT AIMING TO BE NO.1
Last month the world No.4 revealed his physiotherapist had advised him not to play too many matches on clay because of the impact the demanding red dirt would have on his knee.
He had, after all, taken an enforced six months off after Wimbledon last year because of an injury which had threatened to end his glorious career.
After winning the Miami Open in March, his 20th match of the season, Federer said his body and his mind needed time away from the grueling Tour.
Federer, outside the world's top 10 before his incredible Australian Open triumph in January, has climbed to No.4 in the world rankings, having suffered defeat just once this year.
The Swiss will not currently play enough matches to close the big gap between him and world No.1 Andy Murray, who is six years his junior.
In fact, these days Federer is less concerned about his ranking and has no intention of changing his schedule in a bid to knock Murray off the top spot.
"I just don't think I can," said Federer, speaking before his exhibition match with Murray for the Swiss' foundation earlier this month.
"I would like to. At 23 years old, absolutely, you can start saying I'll play the last 20 tournaments of the season if it helps with me getting a better chance with the world No.1.
"That's exactly, though, when I get injured. That's exactly when I burn out and that's exactly when it all ends so that's exactly why I did take a break for six to seven weeks and just really relax the body again.
"I also said the mind needs a break, the stress and pressure that I have every single day from playing is a lot. "I won't change anything. If it happens great, but I really think it's a long, long shot. But, who knows. I really hope I can do very well at Wimbledon and the US Open this year."
'I HOPE TO RETIRE ON MY OWN TERMS'
It is at Wimbledon, not the French Open, where Federer is more likely to claim his 19th grand slam.
Rafael Nadal, Novak Djokovic and Murray will be above him in the pecking order in Paris on a surface he has not always enjoyed playing on.
But even if he did win a record eighth Wimbledon title, Federer said he had no plans to retire.
"Honestly, I wish I knew a date, where I said 'okay this is going to be my last tournament,' then I could plan my whole life around it, but I don't," he said.
"I want to leave it open. We'll see what happens, see what I feel. I just hope when I leave, I can do it on my terms."  CNN

Rugby Sevens World Series: Canada wins historic first title in Singapore
They say good things come to those who wait -- and Canadas rugby sevens team has done its fair share of waiting.
The North Americans made history in Singapore at the weekend beating USA 26-19 in the final to clinch its first World Rugby Sevens tournament title in the series 18-year history.
Its hard to put into words how it feels, captain John Moonlight told CNN pitchside after the win. Weve worked so hard over the years.
The core group of us, weve got some good young guys coming through and this year we didnt know what was gonna happen -- and its awesome, were so excited.
We beat three of the top five teams today and on any given day any team can beat anyone in sevens. We know if we keep playing hard, were going to be up there every time. Were showing that Canadian rugby is on the scene now.
In a tense final against the USA, Canada looked to have the title sealed early on after racing into a 19-0 lead.
However, nerves and inexperience appeared to play their part as Perry Baker scored twice to drag the USA back level.
With the game looking like it could go either way, Lucas Hammond took advantage of a brief opening in the USA line to seal a historic win.
All that remains now, perhaps, is a congratulatory telephone call from Canadas Prime Minister, and avid rugby fan, Justin Trudeau.
Well, hopefully we hear from him, Moonlight said, when asked by CNNs Christina Macfarlane. He played a little bit of rugby with us back in the day so you never know, he might show up!
The victory is another feather in the cap for Canadas coach Damian McGrath, who led Samoa to a shock win at last years Paris Sevens.
Its incredible, McGrath told World Rugby. Last night we were beaten by Fiji so we had a little bit of soul searching and then we came back and beat some of the best teams in the world.
This will show that Canadian rugby has so much to offer.
FINAL-DAY DRAMA
In Sundays first quarterfinal, USA upset Olympic champion Fiji thanks to a Ben Pinkelman-inspired performance.
The 22-year-old ran over two tries to lead his side to a 24-19 win.
Australia then ensured South Africas Blitzboks wouldnt compete in the semifinals for the first time this series.
Trailing by 10 points with just a minute remaining, Tom Lucas ensured a grandstand finale by running half the length of the pitch to give Australia a fighting chance.
The Aussies then regained possession almost immediately after the restart and a brilliant break and offload by Liam McNamara allowed Lachie Anderson to score under the posts, which left a simple conversion for the win.
The whole squad is pretty pumped by the effort that the boys put in there, Lucas said after the win. It was a great performance out there. We fought right to the end and just didnt give up.
Eventual winner Canada then made it three quarterfinal upsets in a row, triumphing 26-14 over New Zealand -- thanks in part to Nathan Hirayamas dancing feet.
The 29-year-old changed direction twice in the blink of an eye to evade the attempted tackles of two Kiwis and finished with a pirouette to cross the line.
In the last quarterfinal, it was Kenya which suffered last-gasp heartbreak, as Englands Dan Bibby scored a penalty with the last kick of the game to give his side a narrow 13-12 win.
SEMIFINAL SHOCKS
The day of shocks continued as the teams entered the semifinals, with the USA producing a comeback win to steamroll Australia 40-7 thanks to a scintillating performance from Perry Baker.
The long-legged speedster raced clear of two chasing defenders, running more than half the length of the field to spark a dominant US display.
Justin Douglas then led Canada to a convincing 17-5 win over England to book a place in the final, scoring one try after a blistering run down the wing and setting up another with an inventive break between Englands lines. Its an unbelievable feeling, Hirayama, who was named player of the final, told World Rugby.
A lot of us have been on the scene a long time and we came through some dark times, but to come away with that win was special.
Beaten semifinalist England overcame Australia 14-12 to win the bronze medal match, while Wales beat Scotland 24-12 to claim the Challenge Trophy.  CNN

## Title: Save Mother Earth
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Editorial
## Date: Saturday, April 22, 2017 - 01:00
Save Mother Earth
Today, we celebrate the planet we live in. We affectionately call it Mother Earth because it is like a mother that looks after us. This is a universal expression  for example, the Sinhalese term Mahee Kanthawa means much the same thing. International Mother Earth Day (April 22) reminds us that the Earth and its ecosystems give life and sustenance. Remember, Planet Earth is our only home, at least until we colonise Mars and go in search of Exoplanets beyond the Solar System. But that is a long, long time away.
Earth Day, as it is better known, also recognizes a collective responsibility, as called for in the Rio Declaration, to promote harmony with Nature and the Earth to achieve a just balance among the economic, social and environmental needs of present and future generations of humanity. It provides an opportunity to raise public awareness around the world to the challenges regarding the well-being of the planet and all the life it supports.
We do not have to look far to realise the need for saving Mother Earth from man-made perils. The recent garbage dump tragedy in Meethotamulla is a grim example of the effects that Man is having on the environment and the Earth itself. Ignorance and/or the lack of knowledge on the importance of saving the environment is one of the leading causes of environmental damage. Hence the Earth Day theme for 2017 Environmental & Climate Literacy.
Environmental and climate literacy seems to be in short supply around the world. It is as important as alphabetic, mathematical and computer literacy though education planners have not paid any attention to this. If small children are not taught, for example, that dumping garbage indiscriminately will one day have disastrous consequences, our future will indeed be bleak. Raising awareness on environmental issues is essential, among both children and adults.
Education is the foundation for progress. As the UN says, we need to build a global citizenry fluent in the concepts of climate change and aware of its unprecedented threats to our planet. We need to empower everyone with the knowledge to take action on environmental protection. Environmental and climate literacy is the engine for advancing environmental and climate laws and also for accelerating green technologies. This should be a global effort spearheaded by Governments and the media.
Climate change is the biggest environmental issue of our time. We have already felt the effects of climate change in Sri Lanka and around the world. Flash floods, long droughts, wildfires, heat waves (even in the Arctic), changed rainfall patterns, vanishing ice caps  these are all signs of climate change, caused mostly by the excessive use of fossil fuels.
The biggest threat is the rise in global temperatures and sea levels. This year is on track to become the hottest year in recorded history, with spring coming early in many places. Some projections say temperatures could rise by nearly 5 Degrees Celsius by 2100. Many small islands could disappear off the face of the Earth in the next 100 years as a result of rising sea levels. There is irrefutable evidence to suggest that climate change is definitely not a hoax. Other environmental disasters continue unabated  including deforestation, extinction of animal and plant species and the depletion of water sources.
We do not have to wait till the next climate change summit to cut down on fossil fuel emissions. Governments must fast-track the usage of renewable energy, especially wind and solar where possible. Germany already derives 30 percent of its electricity output from renewable sources with the eventual goal of achieving 100 percent penetration. Governments must encourage the use of hybrid, plug-in electric (and hydrogen fuel cell) cars along with solar-powered chargers and improve public transport networks to reduce the citizenrys reliance on private cars.
However, Governments cannot act alone to protect the environment without the support of citizens. Every little bit helps in this endeavour. If you turn off an unwanted light bulb, you reduce the consumption of fossil fuels for thermal energy. If you walk or cycle to the junction to buy your groceries instead of taking the car, you save fuel and hence, cut down on emissions. The mantra to remember is Reduce, Re-use and Recycle (3Rs). We can reduce the wastage of food and fuel, re-use our bags for shopping (non bio-degradable polythene will last up to 1,000 years in a landfill) and recycle everything from aluminium cans to paper. These steps do not cost a cent, but could save a fortune. This should essentially be a part of the environmental literacy drive in Sri Lanka and elsewhere.
The world is facing many challenges from famine to drought that are primarily brought about by climate change. As the world population reaches nine billion by 2050, it will be crucial to share the Earths resources in a sustainable manner. If we fail to act now to save Mother Earth, future generations will suffer. That should be our overriding concern on this Earth Day.

Secure economy on the horizon
We were told that Sri Lankas fuel imports spiked by more than 50 percent in December, 2016, compared to a year earlier. Vehicle imports slowed down, following the new loan-to-value (LTV) restrictions introduced by the CBSL. The trade deficit widened by 16 percent in December, compared to a year earlier, and 2016 was widened by a sharp 8.4 percent to USD 9.09 billion.
If the current signs are of things to come, and the global economy moves into a phase of sustained recovery over the remainder of this decade, Sri Lankan exports have a strong opportunity to take advantage of this. Especially as exports are still largely reliant on traditional markets of the US and EU, any recovery in these markets will benefit Sri Lankan exports. Yet, in order to be truly resilient, the focus must also be on entering into new markets and enhancing the competitiveness of our exports.
In this context, when president says that country is heading towards a very positive and strong economic stability with foreign reserves too exceeding USD 5 billion, people may become optimistic.
Some time back, while pledging to not privatize state institutions, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe promised to boost the countrys economy and double the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2023. Later, he said, We will take this country forward, without family rule. He added, We wont privatize state institutions, but we will also make sure they will not be a burden to the public.
The Premier also said that the government will not increase the taxes on the essential items, while carrying out work to develop the country with the assistance of the international community. Wickremesinghe also promised a new salary scheme for public servants, which will be introduced by 2020.
Though one could be optimistic about economic indications, there are strong misgivings on the side of the human rights issue. It is considered insolent to say that Missing person may be hiding in a foreign country, reluctant to come back, for several reasons.
Maybe more than 4,000 fled to overseas countries during the last stages of war; however, until the truth is out, these will be counted as those went missing. That is exactly why a powerful truth commission is necessary. Until then, according to state statistics, it shows a loss of nearly 150,000 from North East. It is true that Paranagama Commission did a report on this matter, and about 14,000 disappearances were identified. Report itself admits the investigation was done under difficult conditions; hence, this figure is not accepted, and with UN's support, a new investigation has been launched by this government. Anybody interested in a solution should support and expedite this effort of Yahapalanaya. Of course, Paranagama did a committed job under difficulties.
In order to complete the efforts of great man, we must go forward, not backwards. what should be done is to use the mechanism introduced to gather information about the missing people to identify suffering of each family, and if there are needy people among them, to pay compensation and implement policies that would be strong enough to avoid a recurrence of a similar situation.
There is an allegation that some ministers are tight-lipped on the so-called hunting of war heroes, and that the president is influenced by them.
However, all agree that there were about 150,000 of security forces who were involved in the military operation.
There could be small groups out of them who dared in committing personal crimes. On the other hand, it is clear there were two organized factions. One was acting on the orders given by those of the MR regime.
It is very clear that the killing of Lasantha Wickrematunga and the disappearance of Prageeth Eknaligoda took place in that environment. There were accusations leveled against others in power over the abduction of Eknaligoda. These stories were related quite often.
The peoples judiciary has now proved who was behind it, and who did it. Rajapaksas should be responsible for Eknaligoda abduction; because it had been done by the security and intelligence units. He was abducted on several occasions before that as well. Now the whole story is out.
The CID had recorded evidence. Those who accused others now know who was behind it. But some say courts are yet to prove it. But peoples verdict has already been made. There are many other groups who committed crimes personally.
They have not been directed by the Rajapaksas, but by fascist motivation; also on their own for earning ransom or demand a payment. These have to be investigated in a transparent manner.

## Title: SLC Super Provincial L/O tournament for whose benefit
## Supertitle:

SLC Super Provincial L/O tournament for whose benefit
Matches go ahead with top management overseas :
For whose benefit is the Super Provincial limited-over tournament conducted by Sri Lanka Cricket (SLC) being played
The tournament was hurriedly arranged replacing the 4-day first-class provincial tournament that was scheduled with SLC making the announcement that it would be used as a forerunner to selection for the ICC Champions trophy to be held in England in June.
But while the Super Provincial limited-over matches are going ahead it is learnt that the Head Coach Graham Ford, Cricket Manager Asanka Gurusinha and Chairman of Selectors Sanath Jayasuriya are all currently overseas. So the question arises how seriously are, these matches being viewed with three top people who will play a prominent part in team selections not around.
The Bangladesh debacle appears to have thrown the SLC administration into a deeper muddle with contradictory announcements being made on a regular basis. It gives a casual observer the sense that a whole bunch of self proclaimed highly paid surgeons are groping in the dark. Even the best surgeon in the world needs to first diagnose what ailment a patient is carrying before performing remedial surgery. Heres why one is pushed towards that assumption.
When Asanka Gurusinha was touted as the remedy for all ills afflicting our national side it was stated at a press conference that the chairman of the selection committee shall basically be reporting to him with Gurusinha performing the role of tour selector. A few days later it is announced that Gurusinha has been drafted into the selection committee under Jayasuriya in the capacity of chairman. Then we hear whispers that Graham Ford is thoroughly unhappy about Gurusinha encroaching into his territory and is about to throw in the towel and exit.
So, can somebody at SLC please state with clarity what each of these highly paid individuals job descriptions are and the reporting structure is
In the absence of having clearly defined roles in areas of responsibility in the management team Sri Lanka can forget about making a turnaround at the Champions Trophy. As with any institution team work at the helm is a pre-requisite towards breeding success. Then there needs to be a level playing field and an environment where there is mutual respect among the players in the dressing room. The simple formula that can be prescribed is a complete merit based selection policy with clearly defined roles for each player.
There are also lots of announcements being made about the resources made available and the preparations in place leading up to the campaign. But, are these administrators missing the woods for the trees
There has been much comment from ex-cricketers about the lack of a talent breeding domestic structure, the lack of proper training infrastructure etc. However, let us not forget for a moment that this country has featured in five World Cup finals without any of these facilities.
There are several other countries that boast of all conceivable resources and more who have not progressed beyond the semi-finals at a World Cup campaign. Does this say something about the sheer cricketing talent this little country of ours is blessed with
So, actually where does the missing piece lie It is most probably in selections and player identification.
Right royal embarrassment and disaster was averted during the recently concluded series against Bangladesh when an off-spinner was hurriedly drafted in after the anomaly was given wide publicity in the media. If not for this last minute inclusion the results no doubt would have been untenable than leveling the series across all three formats.
Then we also witnessed fast bowlers who were originally picked being confined to the bench with late inclusions getting picked in the playing eleven ahead of the original squad members.
This raises further questions on player identification. A close look at the teams selected for the hurriedly arranged Provincial limited-over tournament does not give one much confidence as players who should be front runners for a slot in the Champions Trophy campaign were either kept on the bench or were sidelined as standbys.
In spite of such blatant shortcomings the sports hierarchy and SLC has kept faith with the present selection committee by extending its tenure by a further year. So, the onus is now on Jayasuriya and Co to deliver on the faith vested on him by first and foremost picking the most suitable captain that can lend leadership towards victory, pick the right batsmen with clearly defined roles to perform in the batting order, and more critically pick the all important bowling line up that can deliver on the current power play structure.
They simply need to be specialists capable of picking up wickets in the middle overs not half-baked all-rounders as was the case during the Bangladesh series.
However, it is baffling how the top management intends identifying and picking the right players with the Head Coach, Cricket Manager and Chairman of Selectors all on overseas leave whilst the hurriedly arranged, widely publicized Provincial tournament is going on.
It is interesting to see if the ICC will be fooled into giving SLC a postponement of the April 25 deadline to name the 15 member squad like they did on several occasions during the World T20 tournament in India in 2016.
It is pertinent to mention that the squad that was approved by the Minister of Sports and declared to the ICC was changed just before the team boarded the flight to India.
It is absolutely imperative that the selectors pick the right players and the right combination creating an environment of mutual respect in the dressing room. Otherwise, even training in the North Pole in preparation for the English summer is not going to yield the desired results.

## Title: Soccer stars bond with five-year-old cancer sufferer

Soccer stars bond with five-year-old cancer sufferer
It's not unusual for friendships to be formed through football, but the bond forged between a five-year-old boy suffering from a rare form of cancer and a leading soccer star has provided one of the more unusual -- and heartwarming -- talking points of this season.
In September, Sunderland fan Bradley Lowery, who was diagnosed with neuroblastoma in 2013, was the club's mascot for the game against Everton at the Stadium of Light in the north east of England.
Fans of both clubs chanted Lowery's name in the fifth minute -- a number to match his age -- before a "We're with you, Bradley'" banner was unfurled.
But for Lowery, getting the opportunity to meet his hero Jermain Defoe was arguably the most thrilling aspect of the day. And the player felt a similar sentiment.
"As soon as he saw me, he ran over to me and jumped on my lap," recalls Defoe in an interview with CNN World Sport.
"I think probably from that moment, it was sort of overwhelming, because I was like 'oh wow.' And that sort of love he gave me from day one was just like, that instant moment, was sort of like when we bonded. It was just a great feeling."
HOSPITAL VISIT
The two of them have, at times, been inseparable with Defoe supporting Lowery as the youngster has battled cancer.
In February, Defoe and his Sunderland teammates visited Lowery in hospital, with the young boy falling asleep in the 34-year-old striker's arms. "He said to me 'do you want to get into the bed'" recalls the visibly moved Defoe.
"I was like, 'OK, no problem.' So, we sort of sat on the bed, and at this point he was really tired, because obviously it was a long day.
"We played with some toys and stuff like that and he told me about his girlfriend Poppy which was kind of funny.
"And then, literally, he just said to his mom: 'Can you turn the lights off' And he sort of like put the blanket over me because he wanted me to be warm. He put the blanket over me, gave me a cuddle and he fell asleep.
"You know with some things it's difficult to find the exact words to describe how I felt at that time because I didn't really know what to do. I gave him a cuddle and I just felt good."
ENJOY EVERY MOMENT'
Last month the bond between Defoe and Lowery grew even stronger.
Lowery led out the England team at Wembley Stadium for a World Cup qualifier against Lithuania.
Though goalkeeper Joe Hart was captain, he swapped places with Defoe in the tunnel so they could have the honor of leading the teams out, a gesture not lost on the striker.
"Joe Hart said to me 'you go in the front and walk Bradley out,'" recalls Defoe.
"All the lads know the bond between me and Bradley and how important it is for him to be happy and enjoy every moment ... I mean, these moments will live with me for the rest of my life. I will never forget all the times he's walked out with me."
While Sunderland is looking likely to be relegated to England's second tier, Defoe has been in the form of his life, scoring 14 goals in the league and winning a recall to the international team.
He is at pains to emphasize how Lowery is on his mind whenever he takes to the pitch.
"To be honest, every time I play I always think about him, even in the England game," said Defoe, who scored in the 2-0 win over Lithuania.
"I just thought, you know what, I love scoring goals and I want to play well for my country and for my family, but every time I go out on the pitch it's always at the back of my mind. I want to do well, I want to score a goal for little Bradley."
Sadly for Bradley, the road ahead does not look promising.
His mother recently revealed that the treatment Lowery has been receiving is not working, and that they "don't know how long it will be before the cancer wins, but what we do know is that we will continue to make memories and enjoy our super hero every second of the day."
An upcoming trip to Disney World is in the works, and Defoe's diary continues to fill up.
"All I can do is try and spend as much time with him as possible and that's what I'm going to try and do from now until the end of the season, just try and see him when I can," explains Defoe.
"He's got a birthday party soon, which I'll be going to with my girlfriend, so we're looking forward to that. But just to be around him, just to try and make him happy with however long he's got."  CNN

Spring dawns on Lankan economy: IMF Head
There is spring in the air and in the global economy too which is also the case with the Sri Lankan economy that is improving at a satisfactory pace, International Monetary Fund (IMF) Managing Director Christine Lagarde told the media at the IMF, World Bank Spring Meetings last week in Washington.
Sri Lanka has a three-year Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme with the IMF since mid last year seeking to boost the balance of payment and ensure sound financial footing to support infrastructure development in the country.
The Sri Lankan economy is improving and will do well this year, Lagarde said.
The IMF mission held its second review on the Sri Lankan economy in March prior to releasing its second tranche of the USD 1.5 billion loan under the EFF programme.
The mission commended the government for its efforts to implement their IMF-supported economic reform programme with all fiscal quantitative targets.
However, the mission noted that foreign reserves fell short of the target. Progress on implementing structural benchmarks was uneven with some of the reforms lagging behind intended timelines.
However, the mission left certain concerns such as the implementation of structural benchmarks which the policymakers had failed to meet timelines to be discussed at the Spring meetings in Washington this month.
However the IMF is optimistic that the Sri Lankan economy will do well this year if it implements the structural reforms and ensures better tax administration to improve revenue . The Central Bank, a couple of moons ago, predicted economic growth to be around 5. to 5.5 percent this year up from 4.8 percent last year. However, the bank noted that downside risks to the economy from adverse weather and global uncertainties could hamper growth.
On the global economy, the IMF in its Out Look projected the world economy to do better this year and in the next. The global economy has picked up momentum which will be sustained in the medium to long term. Sensible and sound policies have helped push economic growth which we see to reach 3.5 percent this year and 3.6 percent in 2018 up from 3.1 percent in 2016," Lagarde said.
This is good news, but the growth momentum should be sustained. It should be shared equitably, the IMF Chief said. She said further progress hinges on policies to support recovery, lift productivity growth and enhance resilience.
Against the backdrop of rapid technological progress, a cooperative multilateral framework for trade and financial integration has served countries well producing large economic benefits. However, some groups have not been able to share these benefits, Lagarde said
The IMF also noted that there could be possible downside risks to the global economy from political uncertainty and external shocks.
Economists have been concerned over inward policies of the Trump administration, protectionism from advanced economies and high credit growth in China which could have spillovers to emerging economies.
The green shoots of 2011 did not last long. The member states of the IMF will discuss how the growth momentum could be sustained. Even with uncertainty, we need to see how the growth is sustained with inclusive growth, Lagarde said.
She said the IMF will pay attention to re-invigorate productivity which is low in many advanced and emerging economies and promote inclusive growth with policies within countries and across countries. The IMF will pay attention to promote infrastructure investments, revising housing policy and protecting future generations from imprudent policies of the present generation.
Lagarde said the Fund is pleased to see trade picking up and underscored the importance of trade as an engine of growth.
We will support trade development across the globe and how it could be done efficiently, Lagarde said.

Sri Lanka keen to boost economic ties with India: PM
Sri Lanka is looking forward to strengthen economic cooperation with India, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe has said, noting that development of strategic eastern port town of Trincomalee will be discussed during his visit to the country next week.
Wickremesinghe will arrive in New Delhi on April 25 on a five-day visit during which he will hold talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi to further expand ties in a range of areas.
Addressing reporters in the central town of Kandy yesterday, Wickremesinghe said he was looking forward to strengthen economic cooperation with India.
He said the development of eastern port district of Trincomalee will be discussed during the visit.
"We have plans for an Indian LNG plant in Trincomalee. That could also be a joint venture with Japan," the Prime Minister said.
India and Sri Lanka will jointly operate the oil storage facility at the strategic eastern port town of Trincomalee.
At least 73 of the 99 storage tanks in Trincomalee is to be managed under a new equity arrangement between the two countries, Lankan Petroleum Minister Chandima Weerakkody had said earlier.
Wickremesinghe's trip comes ahead of Modi's visit to Sri Lanka next month to take part in the celebrations marking the UN 'Vesak Day', the most important in the Buddhist calendar.
The Lankan Prime Minister's visit will also be significant in view of the negotiations on the Economic and Technical Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) with India.
The ETCA has met with stiff resistance by trade unions and opposition groups.
The Sri Lankan Prime Minsiter has expressed his resolve to seal the ETCA before the end of this year.ETCA before the end of this year.

## Title: Turning away from the Politics of Garbage

Turning away from the Politics of Garbage
With the tragic disaster Meethotamulla remaining the focus of public interest in the country, there are signs of it giving rise to new political developments that seek to hide the realities that caused this disaster, and prevent moving to a modern and scientific approach towards solving the garbage issue in the country.
The numbers killed in this calamity, 31 known so far and a figure certain to rise, the damage to peoples property, and the fact that all this took place on the fringe of the commercial capital Colombo, and bordering the political capital of Sri Jayewardenepura Kotte, make this a situation easily manoeuvrable by those interested in using it for immediate political gains. The trend of politics that has prevailed in the country prior to this disaster, with oft repeated threats to overturn the government within two full moons, and the not so concealed differences between the two parties of the ruling coalition of unity governance, makes this a situation of strong political gunpowder that can be used by those waiting for an explosive situation, but so far lacking the substances for a good political explosion.
The immediate response of former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, to this situation gives a clue as to how it attempted to put all the blame for Meethotamulla on the present government. He saw in the tragedy the failure of the present government to carry on with his governments plans to transport the Meethotamulla garbage to Puttalam. He tried to give the impression that this tragedy could have been avoided if the Puttalam plan was carried out. We also read that all too frequent voice of the JO, Udaya Gammanpila, say how the best solution was Gotabhaya Rajapaksas plan to take the garbage to Puttalam and use it to fill the abandoned limestone quarries there, due to cement production.
The fact is that the plan to dump the garbage at Puttalam district, in an area bordering the Wilpattu National Park, was abandoned due to adverse environmental impact. There were also major questions raised about the practicality of the garbage in special trains with 26 sealed containers in two trips a day. The Rajapaksa regime had also not paid sufficient attention to the damage this would cause to the wildlife in the Wilpattu National Park, which was stated by those who objected to it. They may have thought of letting the Wilpattu issue to be resolved the same way as the now questionable transport of one community to parts of the forest reserve, which has been stopped by a recent Gazette notification by the President, who is also Minister for the Environment.
The tragedy at Meethotamulla must certainly have given cause for worry to those who have of late been promoting Gotabhaya Rajapaksa as the next Rajapaksa leader of the SLFP, and the Sinhala majority, with their showing his leadership qualities by how he improved the image of Colombo, making it a more pleasant city with much of the construction work he did, while being Secretary, Ministry of Defence and also being in charge of the Urban Development Authority. The fact that has to be noted is that while Colombo did become a place of more beauty, bringing back some of its old world charm, there was the other reality that much of this was possible by increased dumping of city garbage at Meethotamulla. Taking this and the failed proposal to transport Meethotamulla garage to Puttalam, it is seen that the Rajapaksa Regime was a major contributor to building that mountain of garbage that caused the present tragedy.
Political slogans
However, all blame for the current tragedy cannot be placed on the former government alone. It is certainly due to the politics of corruption that has prevailed in the country, for several decades, and the decline of the attention of politicians to the needs of the people, in the planning and conduct of public policy. The situation that needs study and resolution is how the politics in the country could be taken back to one that pays more importance to the needs of the people and society, rather than the success of political slogans or the individual success of politicians.
The public responses to the new developments in the handling of urban garbage shows that once again the involvement of politicians with their own agendas are at play, going contrary to the actual needs of the people. The public in areas such as Karadiyana, Veyangoda, Attidiya and other places could well be concerned about the moves to dump garbage in their areas, after what did happen at Meethotamulla. The task of politicians in each area is to make a good study on how and why the garbage is brought to these places, how long such dumping will take place, and especially see how best a court order on the matter could be carried out. What we see happen instead is that politicians, including ministers of the former Rajapaksa Regime who did contribute to the Meethotamulla disaster, support protesting people, instead of trying to give them a proper civic leadership on this the current crisis, and how it could be faced and suitably resolved.
It will also be useful if the local authorities and other state institutions involved in the moving and handling of garbage seeks to inform the public or civic leaders in a community, before applications are made to court for the necessary orders, and try to place rival arguments also before the Court, before making such an order. It is certainly the duty of all politicians to respect the court orders and take every measure they can to see that there are no politically motivated and manoeuvred protests against the necessary orders for the functioning of society. This does place a huge burden on politicians who are not used to bearing such burdens in this country. This applies both to government and opposition politicians, and it is certainly time, in the midst of peace, and more than a decade after the war with the LTTE, for politicians of all hues and opinions to move towards the service of the people and society, in day-to-day activity, and carry on their political battles at elections, certainly the sooner they are held.
The Presidential order making garbage disposal in the areas of local government institutions an essential service seems to make the task one that will have to be carried out, facing up to any public protests that may arise, and also any political motivations behind such protests. The garbage in our cities and towns has to be disposed of. It should be done with speed, and certainly with the proper scientific and all necessary precautions to ensure that it will not adversely affect the people in their day-to-day life, and also not cause any repeat of what has taken place at Meethotamulla.
Garbage management
Politicians in government must also realize that this is not a situation for political rivalry or in-fighting that may suit personal or any party needs. There is the need for a better understanding of the peoples anger at what has taken place, which is also due to their not being informed of the policies and political trends within government. It seems strange for a minister to say that no garbage will be dumped in any land of the UDA. What is the purpose behind this Should UDA land not be used to bring garbage and then convert it to fertilizer and electricity Will that not serve the people The expansion of such projects will certainly reduce the larger burden on garbage in this small country, which certainly has a manageable volume of garbage, which requires proper handling.
Sri Lanka has experts in the field of garbage management as well as the transfer of garbage to socially beneficial products such as power and fertilizer. The country has youth who can be trained in the handling of material produced by the scientific handling and transformation of garbage, giving them good employment opportunities. Very importantly, there is also the need to revive the project that was once introduced, to encourage households to handle their own solid waste management by the use of compost bins provided by the local authorities. This could lead to an entirely new area of economic activity, which may not gain the publicity of a Port City, but will have very real benefits to the people.
The necessity is to transform the developing politics of garbage rivalry, into one of educating the public and good social mobilization to make best use of this garbage related tragedy to one that will lead to politics beneficial to society, and away from the politics of hatred and anti-social rivalry.
