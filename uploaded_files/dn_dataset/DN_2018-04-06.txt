SriLankan in fresh effort to turn around in 3 years
SriLankan Airlines would be turned around and be made a profit making institution in three years, said new Chairman of SriLankan Airlines Ranjith Fernando.
Speaking to media after assuming office he said that this is a very tall order since the airline is saddled with huge debt of US$ 750 million and several other issues. The airline is overstaffed by over 2,000 and top of it have to pay heavy interest for aircrafts that are not required for the airline. The rising oil price too is a concern.
He said that they will speak to the unions and other stakeholders and look at ways to shedding away excess staff and a golden hand shake too may be on the cards.
A banker by profession he said that one of the priorities of the airline would be to cancel the contract for four new A350 aircraft and a top international legal team is negotiating it.
However the airline also has several positive factors which can be fine tuned to make the airline profitable.
One such is the Colombo Melbourne route which has a nearly 100% seat factor.
We are also studying the re-structuring plan that is being offered to us.
Board Member Susantha Katugampola said that Sri Lankas strategic geographical location too is a positive factor that can be converted towards making the national carrier a profitable one. Board Director, Mano Tittawella who is also the Senior Advisor to the Minister of Finance said that turning around SriLankan is a difficult task but they would do it. We cannot expect anymore handouts or dole from the government to fund the airline.
Meanwhile Chairman of Sri Lankas National Public Private Agency Thilan Wijesinghe said that negotiations to sell a stake of SriLankan Airlines also failed as the bidder did not see any value in taking over SriLankan. If we are to negotiate successfully the airline structure has to improve and this is what is currently done.
The new Board including Dr. Roshan Perera and Air Marshal Kapila Jayampathy also said that they would be working in an honorary capacity and would not seek a salary or any other perks until such time the airline is turned around.

Visa celebrates 30 years in Sri Lanka
Announces rural  digital iteracy program with Sarvodaya
Visa, the global leader in digital payments technology, completed 30 years of operations in Sri Lanka since commencing operations in 1988. Continuing its pioneering efforts to build awareness for digital payments in Sri Lanka, Visa celebrated the milestone by announcing initiatives to promote digital access, and digital and financial literacy across rural communities through its collaboration with Sarvodaya Fusion.
Visa will also be sending 30 three-wheelers across the country to promote the simplicity and the value digital payments bring about to everyday lives, helping every day Sri Lankans realise the true potential of going digital.
Over the past 30 years, we have been able to forge strong partnerships with Sri Lankas financial institutions, partners and merchants in empowering and facilitating digital payment solutions, said Chris Clark, Regional President, Asia Pacific, Visa. Through the initiatives announced today, we reinforce our commitment to further build awareness and acceptance for digital payments across Sri Lanka.
Visa will be partnering with Sarvodaya Fusion, the community based development organisation network, in a three-phased program to inform, engage and educate consumers and businesses across Sri Lanka of the benefits of transitioning to a digital platform. Meanwhile, the three wheeler initiative on digital payments will witness Visas clients including banks, merchants and technology partners joining hands in a coordinated effort to inform and influence audiences across 30 towns and cities across the country.
From EMV pin-based cards to state-of-the-art contactless technology-based cards, Visa has continued to be at the forefront of driving innovation in the market. With the rapid evolution of digital payments in Sri Lanka, we are excited about the potential for digital payments in the country for years to come, said TR Ramachandran, Group Country Manager, India & South Asia, Visa.
As a large cash based economy, Sri Lanka has been making rapid strides in transitioning towards a digital economy. As a recent study estimated, Colombo, with a population of 694,000 and GDP of US$6.5B, could alone gain US$200M annual net benefits by transitioning into a digital economy. Estimated catalytic impacts for the city over the next 15 years include 20.4 basis point increase in GDP growth rate and 2.1% increase in employment.
Recognising the huge potential for digital payments in the country, in 2016 Visa opened its first office in the country and has since continued to expand its footprint along with its clients and merchant partners. Visa is currently associated with 29 banks and nine finance companies helping it offer debit, credit, commercial and prepaid services to Sri Lankans across the country.
Visas first Country Manager for Sri Lanka & Maldives, Anthony Watson said, In under two years, we have been able to further reinforce our leadership in the market. Continued support from our clients and consumers as well as the progressive approach to the payments industry adopted by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka have been critical in this journey.
We look forward to introducing many more innovative solutions that we hope will help support Sri Lankas transition towards a digital economy.
Visa Inc. is the worlds leader in digital payments. Our mission is to connect the world through the most innovative, reliable and secure payment network - enabling individuals, businesses and economies to thrive.

## Title: Ban the black market and permit the popular pesticide
## Supertitle: Glyphosate ban: The debate continues...

Glyphosate ban: The debate continues...
Ban the black market and permit the popular pesticide
It is no secret that Sri Lanka banned glyphosate largely because of political pressure. Of course, the claim made by the anti-glyphosate lobby is that its use causes a chronic form of kidney disease. Surprisingly, while this disease hits many villages in the Dry Zone, it spares others that also use glyphosate! It also spares the Wet Zone where glyphosate is most heavily used. Most scientists and kidney specialists hesitate to link glyphosate with this kidney disease.
Today, after three years of the ban and devastated crops, be it maize, paddy or tea, a committee of specialists has advised the minster in charge to lift the ban. If not for the huge black market in glyphosate, the damage to agriculture would have been much worse. However, Venerable Athuraliye Rathana Thera has threatened to fight in the streets if the President lifts the ban.
Is it a health risk
Gylphosate is a weak Class-II hazard (not a health risk) according to the WHO . This means that glyphosate may cause cancer if very large amounts are consumed regularly. These large amounts have to be large indeed, since the WHO and the FAO stated that even an intake of some 60 mg per day by a person of 60 kilos (i.e., 12 teaspoons per day) could be tolerated regularly! A farmer uses glyphosate only for a few days in each pre-planting season and absorbs less than a millionth of a teaspoon even if he uses no protective clothing, as shown in 2004 by Prof. Aquavella who studied urine and blood samples of farmers who did NOT use protective clothing while applying glyphosate. Hence it poses no risk to the farmers health, and no protective clothing is needed when using glyphosate. Unlike paraquat, it is not poisonous enough for committing suicide.
In spite of the lack of clear evidence against glyphosate, the GMOA and two university doctors (writing to newspapers) support a continuation of the ban. The two medics justified the ban quoting the Precautionary Principle. They forget that human societies routinely handle far more toxic and environmentally harmful substances like pharmaceuticals, petrol, kerosene, alcohol, tobacco, paint and plastics quite safely, without a ban. Instead of banning these substances, they are safely handled by trained individuals working through companies or government bodies. The same method is used in spraying against dengue.
Driving the black market
Glyphosate is a very popular herbicide of great economic importance; trying to ban it merely drives it to the black market. A minister (or ex-minister) actually stated on TV (August 23, 2017, on Derana) that he uses black-market glyphosate to manage his 30-acre tea estate! When Ven. Rathana Thera said this is illegal, someone asked if it is legal to sell duty-free cars imported by MPs in the black market!
Substances like glyphosate having a high demand CANNOT be banned successfully. People will always get it. However, if it is marketed LEGALLY, one can enforce the required safety standards as used all over the world in some 193 countries. Class-I toxins are far more dangerous than glyphosate which is a Class-II toxin. Many may be surprised that these dangerous Class-I toxins are linked to common substances like petrol, diesel, alcohol, tobacco, and red meat.
In Sri Lanka, kerosene is subsidised by the state. So the nations streets are full of diesel buses and vans that use kerosene while not equipped to burn kerosene. Their exhaust gases are a thousand times more toxic and are a far bigger risk than glyphosate. The danger is compounded by the fact that particulate dust levels in Sri Lankas streets and in adjoining houses are a factor of 100 to 1,000 times higher than those approved by the WHO. The rural houses are no better, with interior cooking fires and smouldering fires (against mosquitoes).
Control rather than ban
Many societies have banned alcohol, tobacco and even meat without success as such societies soon became victims of black marketeers. So, the pressure by the medics and threats by Ven. Rathana Thera of street fights will further enthrone the black-marketeer. The Agriculture Ministers Cabinet paper was the end result of a democratic process involving wide consultations via technical committees. This democratic process is now being threatened.
Dr. Jayasinghe and Dr Herath, who want to keep the ban on, have argued that France looks to eliminate glyphosate in 2020 and that California wants warning labels on glyphosate bottles (but not ban it). But these are well known to be political decisions. The Sri Lankan National Academy of Sciences and many other learned bodies in other countries have expressed views supporting glyphosate. The UK wants to approve glyphosate without further political review for 10 years. The UK thinks that such reviews are a waste of time because the existing periodic review mechanisms are sufficient. Canada, Australia, Japan, China and most other countries also use non-politicised technical reviews, unlike the EU. Glyphosate is freely available in 193 of the 195 countries of the world. The farmers in those countrieshave the right to make the decision about what is best for his farm, with no bureaucrats or politicians imposing on them. The Buddha never coerced the kings to ban anything, but preached individual judgement based one ones own circumstances (ehipassiko).
Whats the alternative
France is just ONE of the 195 countries in the world that is looking for an alternative before a ban. But Sri Lanka is the ONLY country that has put in a comprehensive ban WITHOUT an alternative at the behest of JHU-political pressure. However, the safety of glyphosate is confirmed by a press release on July 4, 2016, by Nobel laureates in science and medicine, published in the Washington Post. The two Sri Lankan doctors ignored the mainstream view in their rush to join the Ecolos who want to ban and govern by DICTAT than by consensus. It is the farmer who faces economic ruin if he fails, and the final decision for choosing his farming methods should rest with the farmer, and not with politicians. The government ministries should provide the necessary advice and a fair market.
Should we wait till all questions about glyphosate are resolved Waiting under a ban is only possible for the elites pampered on organic food. Some 40 percent of schoolchildren come to school hungry, and many adults try to fend off on a single meal made of cheap food without nutrition. We cannot allow amateurs tinkering with the food system anymore.
Questions on toxicity and environmental impact are matters associated with what are known as complex systems, and clear answers are never easily available. The ideas of the French mathematician Henri Poincare were revived in the 1960s by the German physicist von Neumann. Today those ideas have penetrated even into the social sciences and into public health. The main characteristic of a complex system is that you cannot predict how it will behave. Trying to impose a ban on some aspect of its behaviour is destined to fail. Bans are possible for simple on-off systems. That is why the effect of banning glyphosate results in its defiant re-appearance in the black market, where it becomes a coveted object!
The course of action available for the government is clear. It must follow the democratic process and implement the recommendations of the technical committee and remove the ban on glyphosate to prevent catastrophic consequences to Lankas agriculture. Its use according to a well-defined protocol can be set in place. I urge the government to set a tradition of following technical-committee recommendations instead of giving into political or medical ideologues and street fighters.
Finally, we need precautions against toxins being sold in the black market. The government must legalise the time-tested product judged safe to be freely available in 193 countries. Today the Precautionary Principle is understood as taking control, and NOT naively imposing a ban.

'Brow bows' could be the most unflattering beauty trend yet
The bar for bizarre beauty trends keeps getting lifted ever higher in 2018.
If you thought having a piercing where you'd traditionally sport an engagement/wedding ring was the very apex of the weird trend curve, then you were wrong.
So, let's turn our attention to eyebrows. Now, you may think there's only so much you can realistically do with your eyebrows, but seeing as common beauty wisdom says they're the "hangers" for the face, even tweaking them slightly can make a massive impact.
But nothing could prepare us for 'brow bows'.
German makeup enthusiast Lisette Scheffler ( @beautylizs ) showed off this new and unusual trend.
As you can see, to achieve the look, you simply fill in your eyebrows to create a dainty - or massive - bow, with the arch of the brow serving as the tied ends.
You probably have questions. How Why
Luckily, Liz explained her motivation to POPSUGAR :
"I just saw how all of the brow trends became very popular in the past and thought it would be funny to create my own, and so I came up with the bow brows."
Liz's look appears to have caught on, too.
Convinced
If you want to recreate this bold look for yourself, then follow Liz's lead and draw the outline with a Maybelline brow sating pencil and then fill it in with short strokes to achieve the 'bow' look.
Liz the uses Benefit brow gel to define the shape nicely.

Browns launches CSR Brand Browns Shakthi
Brown & Company PLC launched Browns Shakthi, an integrated CSR brand for the Browns Group. The maiden project under the Browns Shakthi initiative was to refurbish Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya in Galenbindunuwewa.
The company prioritized serving education sector at the initial phase and searched for the most deserving schools in remote areas. Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya boasts for a number of zonal accomplishments in volleyball, aesthetics and academics with minimal resources.
Browns Shakthi could be strength to the current and future students of Thodamaduwa Vidyalayaby fulfilling the immediate needs of the school. The students of the selected school largely descended from the hardworking farming community and labour groups who work for a daily wage.
When the Browns Shakthi team initiated the renovation project in Thodamaduwa Vidyalaya in December 2017, the school library was a dilapidated room with a limited number of books and chairs, whereas children mostly read under the tamarind trees. They practiced for volleyball matches in the harsh grounds or paddy fields.
Within four months, the dilapidated room was refurbished into a spacious building with book cupboards, a recommended list of books, chairs and tables while the thorny area in the school premises was cleared, levelled and renovated into a capacious playground.
Separate areas in the ground were marked as a volleyball court and running tracks. BrownsShakthi donated football, cricket, netball and athletic equipment to the school as a support to develop the sporting skills of current and future students in the area. While contributing to elevate the living standards of underprivileged communities, Browns has pledged to repay the environment and promote sustainable development by initiating an island-wide tree planting campaign as a part of the Browns Shakthi CSR initiative.
Being in existence for 143 years, Brown & Company PLC is one of Sri Lankas leading conglomerates in operation today with 50 plus subsidiaries and associates focused on trading and strategic investments.

Caroline Lee Bouvier
Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis had a younger sister, born into the tony Southampton, New York, family as Caroline Lee Bouvier. She lived largely in Jackie's shadow, though some considered her the 'prettier' and more vivacious of the two.
The year before John F. Kennedy announced his run for the US presidency, Lee married for the second time, to Polish Prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill, on March 19, 1959. It was his third marriage. The pair had two children, both of whom were teenagers when their parents divorced in 1974 after 15 years of marriage.
It was Lee who introduced Jackie to Aristotle Onassis, in 1963. Rumors have flown over the years on how Jackie's marriage to Ari after the assassination of Kennedy infuriated Lee, who married and divorced a third time after the prince. Lee, 85, has tried her hand at a variety of things: acting, interior design, public relations.
The socialite has enjoyed the company of celebrities, once hanging out with The Rolling Stones and Truman Capote. She divides her time between New York and Paris, having lived in London with her prince.

Changing global human  resource management practices
In the corporate world, the subject of Human Resource Management has come to stay at the top of the ladder of Business Management supplementing the corporate goals and strong good governance measures. It is the quality and exceptional skills of the staff, workers and the management who jointly possess the keys to corporate Governance and corporate stability of any corporate entity as they will be directly executing the plans, goals, targets and the vision of the Board Of Directors.
All over the world, the high performing top bracket executives usually coordinate with the HR Manager in picking up the best possible team members for the corporate matches in future. One cannot have non-performers and losers in the team. With competition looming large at almost all businesses, corporate management will have to continually search for executives with high innovative skills. Very few businesses are enjoying absolute monopolies. Head Hunting has become an integral part of modern business management. Profitability would be the ultimate goal with any team of staff members.
However, there are other corporate measurements such as corporate standing, customer acceptance, good CSR practices, lower staff turnover levels and a number of other norms to measure the level of corporate success. Major corporate conglomerates even proceed to the extent of spying over the activities of the top executives of rival companies. Some executives pass on core information to rival companies while some others join rival companies after gathering vital and core business secrets of their present companies. Some companies even make reward payments to executives of rival companies for passing on sensitive information to them on a regular basis. This type of practices are common in high tech product and service manufacturing and marketing companies or in companies subject to subtle changes in demand over the sensitiveness of key factors.
Therefore, the appointment of an efficient HR manager is of great importance to the success story of any corporate entity. As it is the vision of any company to recruit and retain a long serving staff cadre, the top management should assist the HR manager in recruiting the most suitable staff members to achieve group results at various levels. HR Manager could be considered as the live wire of any organization who will immediately unearth and remedy the conflicts of staff members within an organization. It is common to find the following types of conflicts within an organization at any time.

* Intra individual conflicts within a group
* Inter group conflicts
* Managerial conflicts
These conflicts will come into surface only in specific situations or at times of poor business results of a corporate entity. Finding fault with each other at a later stage will pull the company backwards and will not yield the corporate results expected.
It is up to the directors and top management to strengthen the hands of HR manager at all times. It is common to find the following duties and responsibilities for a HR manager in a conventional corporate entity.

* Maintenance of accurate up to date records of all employees in personal files
n Maintaining the secrecy of core details of top managers and executive staff as far as possible which would lead to above conflicts at any time. The secrecy could be established by using special passwords and changing same periodically so that other members of the HR department will not have access to confidential information or by improved technology.
*Ensure the payment of statutory dues to state institutions on due dates pertaining to the Employees and also meeting deadlines for monthly remuneration payments.
* Procuring the progress and performance reports from all departments to assess the needs of job enrichment of every staff member.
* Continuous sourcing of staff through varied recruitment channels and industry reports.
* Introduction of periodic incentive schemes for work groups in consultation with top management and Board Of Directors.
*Arranging high quality training & development programs to enhance the skill and productivity levels of all staff members.
* Invitation of external agencies and plant/machinery suppliers to carry out periodic training programmes for staff members and top management
* Timely and effective communication of all directions, decisions, instructions, guidelines, company policy decisions, work rules/times and work ethics, to ensure strict compliance

* Usage of main/departmental notice boards for effective communication, if required
n Ensuring job enrichment measures such as promotion, salary increases, incentives, profit bonus, holiday pay and better working conditions, to retain the high performing and other staff*
Mitigation of staff/management turnovers to minimum levels and also to match the industry statistics.
nInitiation of staff welfare/distress/medical/housing/vehicle and higher education funds covering the employees and their immediate family members depending on levels of internally generated profits and the policy of the company
* Carrying out periodic industry statistics surveys and duly informing the management
* Designing of recruitment, promotion, retrenchment, transfer, dismissal and other situational documentation in a standardized format
n Physical observation of work procedures and target achievements of different departments together with the departmental heads of each department for improvement of productivity and quality and assessment of staff at work stations.
* Ensuring of security and retaining of all files to be in line with the statutory requirements
Let us now consider the impact of external factors on HR practices in a global environment. These factors fall into five major categories.

*Economic factors
* Political factors
* Legal factors
n Technological factors
* Cultural factors
Due to above factors emerging from time to time, HRM practices may well vary from entity to entity at both national & international levels. Internationally, the most important factors which can affect HR practices within the organizations are world economic conditions and technological innovations. At national level, economic, legal and political scenarios, cultural and demographic developments are the factors which affect HRM practices. Due to external factors, the traditional and commonly followed HR practices may not be practically possible to implement. The economic woes of a country will have a direct bearing on the labour markets/supply of a country.
This will affect the recruitment and selection practices of a company, later. The per capita income of a country, its labour laws and GDP levels will influence the minimum wage rate. Quoted companies in Sri Lanka have separate remuneration committees and they look into wage/salary structures from time to time and formulate remuneration policies. Political factors are taking precedence in times of elections, political uncertainties or based on election promises.
Globally, contemporary HR related laws are mainly based on prevention of sexual harassment, work safety and health Management, labour union action/contracts, disability and a few more areas. Legal framework decides the application of varied HRM practices through labour and employment laws.
Demographic factors are the attitudes and characteristics of work force such as Gender, literacy level, race, cultural background & level of education. Ratio of men & women in work force and the cultural diversity has its share of bearing on organizational performance, mainly within the organization.
Ethical behavior has now become a central point for the cultural values. As a result, HR practices have been designed with ethical codes of conduct at work place which every employee has to sign and follow. This has become a paramount necessity at work places due to globalization.
The political factors pose immense influences on HRM policies of all companies. Some countries exercise very little influence on the HRM policies of companies. A good example is Hong Kong. On the contrary, Singapore government has been monitoring the HR practices and is continuously monitoring the pay and incentive schemes so that HR personnel have to strictly adhere to the rules and regulations.
In Japanese conglomerates, the findings, research work and connected work results in new productive ideas which will be reviewed and accepted by the other managers after a review by the chief executive officer and the Managing Director, if the results expected are in line with corporate objectives.
Unfortunately, this is not the case in some Sri Lankan Companies. Ideas will be either ignored or set aside or will be presented by another as if the ideas were mooted by him/her.
This will discourage the hard working, loyal and forward thinking staff members/managers. A majority of Sri Lankan executives are often deprived of self-development and job enrichment within their respective companies. In some companies, even the private secretaries ,blue eyed staff members, drivers and peons of directors have considerable clout in companies and could easily carry tales to the directors about the executives. These executives at times work under considerable stress and worry and are not interested in putting their best efforts for the company.
This could be a common problem in Sri Lankan companies where corporate governance measures and work ethics are not fully followed. Even, two private secretaries of two directors or managers could easily upset the apple cart by being selfish and petty minded. The obvious outcome will be the formation of rival groups within the company pursuing their own interests. Personal jealousies will creep in to companies as a result of these differences. This type of scenarios are quite common in family owned companies and where directors are worried about their own job securities.
However, most Japanese companies respect individual brilliance and staff commitments. New ideas are accepted from all corners of a corporate entity. Female staff management is given priority in most Japanese companies due to the connection between female employment, fertility and the countrys population. Japanese Governments often face pressures from western countries for the freedom of Japanese women to decide on their own in matters connected with employment. Japanese also have unique retrenchment policies also by introducing meal/health vouchers to the staff facing temporary retrenchment from the company catering service and the company medical unit.
This is to keep them going until new orders for their products/services have been procured and the order books are restored to the original levels. However, in Sri Lanka staff members are continued to be kept in service for lengthy periods despite loss of orders and continued financial losses. No work study and time study exercises are carried out on staff at any time in most corporate entities taking a cue from the state instituitions. This is the main reason for Japanese companies to exist for decades and decades in a stable platform despite domestic/global economic turbulences.
Society for Human Resource Management is the largest HRM body in the world since its formation in 1948.It has nearly 300,000 members in around 165 countries. This society is the leading provider of resources to serve the needs of HR professionals for the advancement of the professional studies in HRM. Further, the society has around 580 affiliated chapters within the United States and affiliated offices in China, India and United Arab Emirates.
New technology is landscaping the whole HRM function with India taking the top slot. From the 21 century beginning, technology and process automation have been blending and integrating with the HR function. With innovation, companies are now bringing in latest and most appropriate technology to their HRM function. More and more employees are now on the lookout for non monetary benefits such as learning, growth and remote working rather than simply working for one organization for their lifetime.
Despite financial prosperity, corporate entities do not appear to be spending these gains on employees and their job enrichment. This scenario has created frustration and at times the work fatigue coupled with feeling of insecurity.
It would be advisable for company managements to devise new methods for profit sharing with the employees after the profits are realized in cash. A greater majority of workers at all levels are hoping for new openings due to inadequate recognition at their work places. As a result, they are continuously on the lookout for monetary benefits either through genuine or fraudulent means. A corporate entity must understand the human mind dynamics and keep them happy at all times following the concept Good pay/benefits for Good work.

Some of the latest trends and facts unearthed internationally are enumerated below for the benefit of all HR personnel in Sri Lanka and abroad.

1. The HR function is increasing its strategic role in all forms of work environments. Clear distinctions are emerging between the HR function and the line management in meeting the responsibilities for HRM policy decisions coupled with reliance on technology based systems.
2. The use of part-time work is decreasing while tele-working and shift-work are on the rise
3. Appraisal processes frequently require the input of employees themselves, very often leading to recommendations for future training and career development needs, as well as remuneration decisions.
4. Number of training days are increasing globally with the advent and introduction of e-learning systems and specific requirements of on the job training
5. Some global corporate entities have unique pay systems. The practice of offering employee benefits that exceed statutory requirements is on the decline in a marginal way, except for health care insurance sector
6. Trade union action is likely to rise as global trade patterns and market shares are affected. There could be pressure on remuneration & perks of executives and directors due to this factor.
7. Downward communication is mostly taking place through electronic means while the upward communication takes place commonly through supervisors
8. References go a long way in the recruitment of middle managers and staff at lower levels. Past experience, performances, remuneration/benefits, achievements and corporate standing will be the considerations for top executives
9. GDP levels and per capita income of the country will also determine the remuneration levels
10. Some corporate entities have resorted to the methods of combined remuneration in the form of salaries, statutory benefits,work/profit and incentives in a combined package forcing the employees to work for profit targets of the company.

In conclusion, it should be stressed that a large number of Sri Lankan entities do not meet the statutory payments to the employees and somehow evade action of state labour authorities. Some employers confirm the employment status of the employees only after 12 months and they somehow get rid of the employees at any level of employment before the completion of the said 12 months. The state labour authorities should visit all registered companies, partnerships and sole trader businesses on a quarterly basis at least, to remedy the situation.

Cyber tool to track accommodation  providers sans valid license
In a bid to enforce registration of all tourism industry service providers in Sri Lanka, the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority (SLTDA) has deployed a new cyber tool to track accommodation providers operating without valid licence from the SLTDA.
This tool scans publicly available online data about tourism businesses and cross-checks them with the Business Licensing Platform run by the state tourism authority.
At the initial stage, the SLTDA will send warning letters to unregistered tourism related businesses in Sri Lanka and direct them to register with its licensing platform.
If these businesses continue to operate without a license, the SLTDA will then transfer their information to the newly established Enforcement Unit of the SLTDA for further legal action.
The SLTDA has already introduced a new online registration service from the beginning of April this year, giving five months notice to the industry of its move to go fully digital. Currently, over 6,000 establishments have registered with the SLTDA, including star class hotels, guest houses, travel agents, restaurants, home stays, bungalows, boat operators, tour guides, chauffeur guides, jeep operators, etc., with a total of 35,000 rooms.
Registration of all tourism related service providers in Sri Lanka is a mandatory requirement under the Tourism Act.

Dhoni Dons the Uniform..!
One of the biggest laughs one has in India is of those conferred with honorary doctorates using the same as titlesbefore their names! Since many politicians have barely passed high school and some just about making it past standard four, having such an educational title is something they aspire for, even insisting they be addressed by such title by all and sundry.
Good morning Doctor sahib!
Doctor Wheres the doctor Oh yes its me!
The army and the air-force also hand out honorary ranks. Dhoni was honoured as Colonel. It is an honorary title, and one respects it, stitches a new uniform on the title giving day then throwsit away.
But not cricketer Dhoni!
MS Dhoni was honoured last week by the President of India with the Padma Bhushan, one of the higher civilian honours, for his prowess as a wielder of the willow, his wicketkeeping skills and obviously his captaincy, but Dhoni thought otherwise. Instead of being a cricketer that day, he played soldier!
He put on his military attire which the army had provided him, and like a sepoy in a march past swung his arms in warlike fashion, marched to the President, nearly uttered a war cry, saluted him,picked up award and marched away!
And the whole of India stands awed. What a soldier! What a salute! What a show!
Butwithout upsetting the followers of the great man, I ask, did the captain of the Indian cricket team get his award for fighting on the Indian borders For defending the country
Im not sure the President had been warned about Dhonis tryst with the uniform and am sure was startled to see aggressive soldier marching straight to him with medals blazing, boots shining. It speaks volumes of the Indian president that he didnt run for cover. Didnt you say I have to give this to Dhoni Who is this warrior
And from all over India peopleholding such honorary titles cheer and say, Like Dhoni is an officer, we are doctors!
Are you sir What is the Pythagoras theorem
Whats that
But you have a doctorate sir
Same journo runs to Dhoni, How do you feel Colonel
Like Ive won a war!
No sir, about your batting
I feel I can lead my troops to Kargil!
Do you think you could hit one of your helicopter strokes again sir
I can conquer China and Russia and all of America!
Are you still quick behind the wickets
I wonder when I will be promoted to general and make India a super power!
Sir what rank is the one after colonel
What I think it is captain! Or is that the navy Hey guys lets talk about cricket
Yes sir Mr.Dhoni, with all due respect, stick to the bat will you, and leave the guns, the uniform and the fancy salutesto them who lay down their lives for yourcountry..! [emailprotected]

Discover glorious Japan
The BMICH, Colombo will be transformed into a Japanese wonderland from April 21 to 23 when the Second Edition of Japan Expo takes place. The first edition held last year was highly successful.
Featuring everything from Japanese movies to tea ceremonies, Japan Expo 2018 is a golden opportunity for Sri Lankans and foreigners young and old to discover Japan.
One of the main highlights of the Expo will be the Japanese tea ceremony called sado. Also called the Way of Tea, it is a Japanese cultural activity involving the ceremonial preparation and presentation of matcha powdered green tea. Kado or Japanese flower arrangements will be another attraction at the Expo. Also called ikebana, it is the Japanese art of creating and appreciating of floral arrangements by using seasonal flowers along with various materials. In kado, not only flowers but also the shape of branch, stems, leaves and moss, and all the other materials used are subjects for appreciation. Started as a tribute to the dead, this spread to all parts of Japan from the 15th century onwards.
Sumo wrestlers
You will be able to see Sumo wrestlers (called Rikishi in Japanese) in action at Japan Expo 2018. Sumo is a Japanese style of wrestling and Japan's national sport. It originated in ancient times as a performance to entertain the Shinto deities. Many rituals with religious background, such as the symbolic purification of the ring with salt, are still followed today. In line with tradition, only men practice the sport professionally in Japan. Matches take place on an elevated ring (dohyo), which is made of clay and covered in a layer of sand.
You can also see the famous Japanese instrument Shamisen in action at Japan Expo 2018. The shamisen is a three stringed lute from Japan, with growing international interest. The most unique quality of the shamisen is its ability to be percussive and melodic at the same time. It can be played quiet as a whisper or, if played forcefully, can be clearly heard outside on a crowded street.
Japanese movies
You can also catch several Japanese movies at Japan Expo. These will either be dubbed or subtitled in Sinhalese. The movies are as follows:
In this Corner of the World (2016) - In 1944, Suzu Urano moves to the small town of Kure in Hiroshima where she marries Shuusaku Houjoua young clerk who works at the local naval base. Living with his family, Suzu becomes essential to the running of the household and creatively prepares meals during the tough wartime conditions while also carrying out daily housework. In 1945, intense bombings by the U.S. military finally reach Kure with devastating effect to the townsfolk and their way of life. Suzus life is changed irrevocably, but through perseverance and courage, she manages to continue to live life to the fullest.
Her Love Boils bath Water (2016) - A strict, but caring mother has an awakening when she is told she has cancer and it is terminal. She has a few months. She needs to complete her tasks in that short time frame. She needs to retrieve her husband who has vanished and get the family business restarted. She needs to help her daughter be able to pick after herself. Will the family bonds grow stronger or wither
100 Yen Love (2014) - Ichiko lives at her parents' home. She rarely hangs out with other people. Things change when her younger sister divorces and moves back with her child. Ichiko and her sister's relationship goes bad, causing Ichiko to move out and live alone. What brings happiness to Ichiko is to watch a middle-aged boxer (Hirofumi Arai) practice at a boxing gym. The boxing gym is located between the 100 yen shop where she works and her home. One day, Ichiko and the middle-aged boxer meet and they begin to live together. This film is more suitable for adults.
Samurai Hustle Returns (2016) - Masaatsu Naito successfully completes Sankin-kotai (required ritual to visit the shogun). On his way home, he hears that an insurrection by peasants has taken place in his hometown of Yunagaya. Masaatsu Naito knows that it is a counterattack by Matsudaira. He returns to Yunagaya, but finds that his castle is gone.
You can also see a Kamen/Joshi performance at the Expo. Meaning "Masked Girls" in Japanese, it is a Japanese girl group consisting of three smaller teams with several members for each. They are called "Masked Girls" because each member of the group wears a mask which covers up their face when performing.
Neputha ceremony
The Expo will also feature a traditional Japanese Neputha ceremony for the first time. This procession will begin from the BMICH and parade the streets. There will also be a Nyangosta drumming show. The performer is dressed like an animal dressed in red. They will be joined by the Sri Lankan Police cultural troupe.
The Expo will also include a workshop session on modern Japanese architecture and interior design by well-known Japanese architect Tsuyoshi Tane. This will be a valuable opportunity for local architects and interior designers. A Digital Video Symposium will be held for the benefit of all practitioners of digital video in Sri Lanka. There will also be several other lectures on various topics. Japanese wall artist Chichiro Koshi will engage in an open production in all three days. Artist Akihiro Nishino will present his picture book exhibition Poupelle of Chimney Town at Hall C.
If you like traditional Japanese food there will be stalls in the outdoor area behind c and e hall and you can taste it in hall number three. Exhibition patrons will also be able to buy other Japanese goods in Hall A and E. There will be a career fair where they will explain about higher educational and subsequent employment opportunities in Japan. Participants will have to fill the forms available at the Kizuna International Companys stall to be eligible. Twenty educational scholarships will also be on offer through Kizuna International, one of the organisers of Japan Expo 2018.

He and other EU MPs are visiting Sri Lanka this week to evaluate the first results of the countrys re-entry into the EUs GSP plus trade programme.
The No-Confidence Motion, which the UNP defeated Wednesday night with a comfortable majority, was a very good example of a real democracy, because the opposition has the full right to put forward a motion of no-confidence, he said. And the government has the full right to defend itself.

EU tracking 65,000 migrant smugglers: Europol
BELGIUM: European law enforcement officials say they are tracking at least 65,000 migrant smugglers, twice as many as at the height of the migration crisis three years ago, as the illegal trade booms.
Despite a drop in the number of migrants successfully crossing the Mediterranean since Europes biggest migration crisis since World War II erupted in 2015, the EUs police agency Europol said demand for smugglers was still huge.
Many new suspects have also been identified, Europol added, as investigators in European countries track one of the fastest growing forms of international organised crime.
At the end of last year we had 65,000 smugglers in our data bases, Robert Crepinko, head of Europols European Migrant Smuggling Centre, told AFP at his offices in The Hague.
Europol reported in September 2015 there were some 30,000 suspected smugglers before the number jumped to nearly 55,000 by the end of 2016, then some 10,000 more in 2017.
Sixty-three percent of those whose nationalities it has identified are from Europe, including 45 percent from Balkan countries, according to Europol figures.
Fourteen percent are from the Middle East, 13 percent from Africa, nine percent from eastern Asia and one percent from the Americas.
Crepinko said smuggling is still a booming business worth billions of euros despite a drop in migrant arrivals last year following EU cooperation deals with Turkey and Libya, the main gateways to Europe.
Libya is currently the main migrant springboard to Europe where reports of enslavement on top of other horrific abuses of sub-Saharan Africans prompted urgent action at an EU-Africa summit in Abidjan in November.
Thousands of migrants were quickly repatriated from Libya to their home countries under a deal reached at the meeting.
French President Emmanuel Macron also announced the two sides would share more intelligence to dismantle the networks and their financing and detain traffickers.
But Crepinko said further law enforcement cooperation depends on obtaining guarantees that human rights will be respected, a challenge when dealing with many African governments.
Thats why there will be no quick wins in that, the Europol official said.
Since last year, Europol has been operating on a new legal basis that restricts information it can share with non-EU countries.
But the agency cited recent successes in cooperation including the break-up of a gang sending young Nigerian women to Spanish cities for prostitution.
Italy, the EUs main migrant entry point, agreed in December to set up a crime-fighting cell with Libyas western-backed government in Tripoli.
Libya then announced last month arrest warrants for 205 people including members of the Libyan security services and embassy officials from African countries based in Libya over people-smuggling.
Amnesty Internationals Marwa Mohamed said the move, which resulted from Italian and Libyan cooperation, could be a step toward ending the sense of total impunity in Libya.
Mohamed, based in neighbouring Tunisia, said Amnesty was checking whether the authorities follow through with arrests and prosecutions in proceedings that guarantee a fair trial. But Eugenio Ambrosi, head of the Europe office for the International Organization for Migration (IOM), said the EU had put too much priority on sealing its borders. - AFP

Facebook breaks could stop people becoming stressed
Results further suggest that while not visiting Facebook causes people's cortisol levels to reduce, they do not report feeling any less stressed.
Study author Eric Vanman, from the University of Queensland, who frequently takes social-media breaks himself, said: 'While participants in our study showed an improvement in physiological stress by giving up Facebook, they also reported lower feelings of wellbeing.
'People said they felt more unsatisfied with their life and were looking forward to resuming their Facebook activity.
'It seems that people take a break because they're too stressed but return to Facebook whenever they feel unhappy because they have been cut off from their friends.
'It then becomes stressful again after a while, so they take another break. And so on.'
This comes after research released last month suggested quitting Facebook makes people happier.
Scientists from the Happiness Research Institute in Denmark found that 88 per cent of people feel 'happy' after giving up the social-media site.
They also describe feeling more enthusiastic, less lonely, more decisive and less worried.
Study participants Sophie Anne Dornoy said: 'After a few days, I noticed my to-do list was getting done faster than normal as I spent my time more productively.
'I also felt a sort of calmness from not being confronted by Facebook all the time.'
The non-Facebook users spent more time with their families and had an easier time concentrating.
The researchers found that people who frequently use Facebook can feel anxiety related to envy towards their online friends after looking at their posts.
They wrote: 'Instead of focusing on what we actually need, we have an unfortunate tendency to focus on what other people have.'

FAO Food Price Index rises again
Rome - The FAO Food Price Index rose in March, driven by robust increases in grains and dairy prices.
In March, the Index averaged 172.8 points, 1.1% higher than in February and 0.7 percent above its value a year earlier.
Declines in price quotations for sugar and most vegetable oils were more than offset by increases for maize, wheat and most dairy products. The trade-weighted price index tracks international market prices for five major food commodity groups.
Worldwide cereal production hit a record level in 2017, up 33 million tonnes from 2016, to nearly 2 646 million tonnes, according to FAO's latest estimate in the Cereal Supply and Demand Brief, also released today. However, FAO's anticipates this year's world maize and wheat production to decline based on early forecasts.
The FAO Cereal Price Index continued on its upward path, averaging 2.7 percent higher than in February and 12.1 percent above its March 2017 value. Wheat prices rose mostly on weather worries, including prolonged dryness in the United States of America and cold wet conditions in parts of Europe.
Maize prices turned even firmer, driven by a combination of robust world demand and deteriorating crop prospects in Argentina.
The FAO Dairy Price Index was 3.3 percent higher in March, as strong global demand pushed up butter, cheese and whole milk powder prices.
The FAO Sugar Price Index declined 3.4 percent and stood at 27.5 percent below its March 2017 value, owing to large export availabilities.
The FAO Vegetable Oil Price Index declined modestly due to price drops for soy, rape and sunflower oils, while palm oil prices firmed up, buoyed by expectations the European Union will resume imports of palm oil-based biodiesel from Indonesia.
The FAO Meat Price Index was mostly unchanged from February, as bovine meat prices eased and those for ovine and pig meat rose on the back of strong import demand, especially by China.
The prospects for global cereal production in 2018 are more restrained.
Worldwide wheat output is expected to drop to 750 million tonnes, about one percent below its near-record level of the previous year. Forecasts suggest that U.S. output may rebound from its 2017 decline, while production in China, India and the Russian Federation may fall after a record year.
Coarse grain output is also expected to decline from the 2017 record, amid bad weather in Argentina, a shift from maize to soybean cultivation in Brazil, and a price-induced reduction in plantings in South Africa.
FAO's latest forecast for world cereal stocks at the close of crop seasons ending in 2018 stands at nearly 748 million tonnes, almost 4 percent higher than a year earlier and hitting a record level, with the increase led by wheat. This large carryover would go some way to mitigate the effect of the projected decline in this year's global production.

Fed up with Facebook
Take a 5-day break
Taking a five-day break from Facebook reduces people's stress levels, new research suggests.Abstaining from the social-media site lowers the amount of the stress-hormone cortisol people produce, a study found.
Yet, the benefits may not be clear cut, with people reporting a reduced sense of wellbeing after not visiting the website for less than a week, with many being happy to check in again, the research adds. Researchers believe quitting Facebook enables people to escape an overload of information but also cuts them off socially. They wrote: 'Our results suggest that the typical Facebook user may occasionally find the large amount of social information available taxing and Facebook vacations could ameliorate this stress - at least in the short term.'
The social-media site was recently hit by a scandal when the communication firm Cambridge Analytica profited from a feature that allowed apps to access data from Facebook users and their online friends without their permission.
This information was used to help influence voters at the ballot box, and was said to play a role in President Donald Trump's victory and the Brexit campaign.

Fitch rates Sri Lanka Telecoms Debt Final AAA(lka)
Fitch Ratings has assigned Sri Lanka Telecom PLCs (SLT, AAA(lka)/Stable) proposed senior unsecured debenture issue of up to Rs 7 billion a National Long-Term Rating of AAA(lka).
The debentures will have a tenor of 10 years and carry fixed coupons. The debentures will be listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange, with the proceeds to be used to refinance short-term debt and fund capex plans.
SLTs senior unsecured debt is rated at the same level as its National Long-Term Rating, as the debentures rank equally with other senior unsecured obligations. The final rating is the same as the expected rating assigned on January 2,2018, and follows the receipt of documents conforming to information already received.
Fitch believes SLTs 2018 operating EBITDAR margin could decline to 24% (2017 estimate: 28%) and its funds flow from operations (FFO) adjusted net leverage could deteriorate to 2.5x (2017 estimate: 1.9x) if it were to pay an additional Rs 3 billion tax for SLTs fully owned subsidiary, Mobitel (Pvt) Ltd.s mobile towers.
However, Fitch believes that such high taxes are unlikely to be implemented in full, and have not therefore factored these into our base case. Fitch expects SLTs ratings to remain unaffected, even if the taxes are implemented, given the high ratings headroom.
The Sri Lankan governments 2018 budget, announced on November 9 2017, proposes to tax mobile operators Rs 200,000 per tower each month.
Fitch expects a free cash flow (FCF) deficit during 2018-2020 (2017 estimate: Rs10 billion deficit), as cash flow from operations could fall short in funding large capex plans to expand the groups optical fibre infrastructure and 3G/4G mobile networks.
Fitch expects capex to moderate to Rs 24 billion-25 billion per year after peaking at Rs 27 billion, or 36% of revenue, in 2017. SLTs fibre investments are likely to have low returns due to the countrys low broadband tariffs. Dividends are likely to remain around LKR1.6 billion-1.8 billion.

Flight with furry night flyers
Juliet Coombe discovers the nightlife at Jetwing Yala, is one of the most unusual in the country with their new bat man experience run by the hotels leading naturalist Chamara Amarasinghe, who will give you a whole new perspective on the debate Dracula versus The Dark Knight.
Some people go to Yala for only a night stay for a safari in the islands most amazing national park and then move onto the next place, but my recommendation is to stay for four or five days and experience some of their incredible nature experiences like the bat tour run late afternoon, which for me personally was a life changing experience. Walking silently around the Jetwing Yala perimeter fence with Jetwing naturalist Chamara pointing out birds and lizards is a fascinating nature trail by day and even more exciting at night time when the Yala bats in Red Arrows formation start to appear over head and then vanish like ghosts into the night or maybe shape shifters that turn into the twinkling star constellation above.
Each bat I am told is key to our echo system both as pollinators and terminators of unwanted air born insects, which would become uncontrollable by us on the ground if they became extinct. Bats, formerly also known as flittermice, have fascinated humans for centuries and have, of course, been defamed quite seriously in the last century by fiction writers and media types like me. Blame it on Bram Stoker and his transmutation of the vampire bat into charming human form, blame it on Halloween when my kids like to dress up like bats to get sweets off the neighbours or blame it on the bat being the carrier of rabies to humans in over 80 per cent of all cases, often in a subtle and therefore fatal way  there are almost no survivors of this viral and hideous harbinger of the grim reaper.
Vampire bats may be the only mammals that feed off animal blood but this is just one species of over 1,100 species of bats worldwide, representing 20 per cent of all mammal species, of which 30 can be found in Sri Lanka. If you are not scared of their bloodlust, you might be scared of the very largest of them, the giant golden-crowned flying fox, which can have a wingspan greater than the average adult womans height. Then you might be unnerved by their being the only mammals capable of sustained flight and then by the fact that they are more adept than birds at changing direction, flying fast and flittingly, in and out of lit areas or whatever else may temporarily expose their dark, craggy and mysterious forms. If youre still not impressed, imagine being able to visualise your environment in pitch blackness in minute detail, through echolocation at up to 200 pulses per second and then on top of that, acute hearing to further identify your preys faintest of movements and flutterings. You might not know also that none of them are blind, though many have poor sight and that they can breathe through their skin in addition to their lungs.
Chamara who has been researching bats for years believes that Sri Lankan bats are different from Indian ones and would like the academic world to look at why and for us to gain better understanding about why it is important to leave our bats in the Church belfry or where ever they are discovered. His eyes light up as he says in short they are amongst the most skilful and talented of natures creatures and still one of the most under-appreciated.
I had no idea until spending a most eye opening evening with Chamara that they play such a vital role in the ecosystem, with 70 per cent of species controlling massive swathes of insects with extraordinarily impressive headcounts per night  up to half their weight, thereby reducing the need for pesticides, which ironically cause the death of very large numbers of them.
They are also responsible for a great deal of pollination by the highly specialised microbats, dispersion of seeds by the fruit-eating megabats, and the provision of a very rich fertiliser, in the form of their excrement, harvested from caves.
I hope after reading this you are now thinking more about the great cricketer Sangakara and his megabat, and Batman, the skilful protector of people with a host of baddies trying to get rid of him instead of the fearful count Dracula. On a very serious note bats are becoming increasingly endangered and some species have been wiped out altogether owing mainly to unhealthy farming pesticides that accumulate in their prey, the fact that many people still eat roasted bats in places like Laos, the ongoing destruction of trees/habitat, the disturbance of roosting caves and the demolition of old houses a place bats love to hang out in and old plumbago mines. The protection of bats by relevant authorities in Sri Lanka and many other countries around the world is just the first step in controlling the decline of this most amazing of animals. By going on a walk and sitting in a group at the end under the stars to pick out the different species the General Manager at Jetwing Yala and Chamara hope every guest and reader of this piece will be the change we need in the world to protect these vitally important creatures that both pollinate and terminate unwanted air born insects.

KEITH NOYAHR, ABDUCTION ASSAULT CASE:
Former Army Chief of Staff arrested
Former, Army Chief of Staff Major General (retired) Amal Karunasekara was taken into custody by the Criminal Investigation Department (CID) at the Army hospital last night in connection with the abduction and assault of senior journalist Keith Noyahr.
The Mount Lavinia Magistrate earlier directed Major Gen. Karunasekara to appear before the CID to record a statement. However, Major Gen Karunasekara yesterday admitted himself to the army hospital with complaints of giddiness and nausea. The army, later informed the CID that he has been admitted to the army hospital.
The CID, having visited the army hospital placed Major Gen. Karunasekara under arrest.
At the time of his abduction on May 22, 2008, Keith Noyahr functioned as the Associate Editor of the Nation Sunday Newspaper.
Later, the CID arrested seven suspected soldiers including Major Prabath Bulathwatte in February 2017 in connection with this abduction and assault. The charge against Major Gen. Karunasekara is that he allegedly assisted the party headed by Major Bulathwatte in the abduction.
Major Gen Karunasekara was the Intelligence Chief of the Army at the time of abduction of Keith Noyahr. When the CID submitted a report to the court, the magistrate imposed a travel ban on Major Gen Karunasekara. Later, he was allowed to travel overseas on an official visit to India since he is now functioning as the Commandant of the Defence College after he retired as army chief of staff.
However, the travel ban was imposed earlier this week after Major Gen.Karunasekaras name was listed as a suspect in the abduction.
The Mount Lavinia Magistrate last night referred the matter to the Colombo Magistrate since the Army Hospital comes under the Colombo Judicial Zone.

GMOAs ignorance and governments inaction
I was dismayed reading the highly irresponsible statement titled Docs urge govt not to lift ban on glyphosate by the GMOA Secretary that appeared in a newspaper recently, and by his total ignorance of the wealth of scientific evidence that absolves glyphosate in the causation of the chronic kidney disease of uncertain aetiology (CKDu). This is not the first time that the GMOA blundered on this matter.
Several years ago, a few scientists, primarily from the Rajarata University, published a hypothesis that glyphosate complexing with metal ions in the hard water prevalent in the CKDu areas in the Dry Zone led to the disease. This hypothesis was totally rejected by several highly reputed professors of chemistry of the Peradeniya University on the grounds of faulty chemistry, and no other scientist or publication ever supported it. However, on that occasion too, the GMOA made a statement to the press supporting the glyphosate ban. Surely, dont these worthies study the matter before making observations
Objection to lifting the ban also comes from the Health Minister and the Parliamentarian Ven. Authuraliye Rathana Thera. The latter who is all the time casting aspersions on chemical farming without understanding the realities of the worlds food issue, has on more than one occasion displayed his ignorance on basic principles of agriculture and ecology. For the reason of brevity, let me enumerate the key facts that absolve glyphosate in the causation of CKDu:
* The 2013 WHO study on CKDu reported that glyphosate levels were above reference limits in the urine of 3.5 percent of the CKDu patients. However, the report for unknown reasons, failed to cite the glyphosate status of urine of healthy patients. Subsequent re-analysis of the data revealed that there were twice as many subjects with not only glyphosate, but several other pesticides above reference limits among healthy subjects compared to CKDu patients! In fact this data absolves not only glyphosate, but even other pesticides in the causation of the disease.
* Then, the 2016 WHO International Consultation held in Colombo, after four days of deliberation, also concluded that that there was no evidence to implicate glyphosate, or for that matter, any other agrochemical, in the causation of the disease. Interestingly, the senior author of the above-reported hypothesis, when questioned about CKDu and glyphosate, remarked that he did not say that glyphosate is the cause!
* Analysis of glyphosate residues in water, soil and food in Sri Lanka by the Office of the Registrar of Pesticide revealed that the levels were well below the safety reference limit cited by the EU and US, 200 and 600 parts per billion respectively. Even a publication by the few local scientists which claimed a role for glyphosate in CKDu, reported only 0.7 to 3.5 parts per billion of glyphosate in water, i.e., levels far below the above safety limits
* The Department of Agriculture approved the use of glyphosate only in 1994 for food crops. However, the very effective total weed killer paraquat (gramoxone), being much cheaper than glyphosate, continued to be used in pre-plant weed control until 2007, when it was banned. Glyphosate use expanded only after 2007 when the Monsanto patent expired. CKDu in the Rajarata was reported as early as 1990, long before glyphosate began to be used in arable farming.
* Evidence is growing that it is the source of drinking water and not any agrochemical that is leading to the disease. It is now known with a high degree of certainty that those who drink dug well water contract the disease but not those who drink surface water (from reservoirs and rivers) or rain water (harvested). This has been dramatically demonstrated in a simple trial at Ginnoruwa (Girandurukotte) with two adjacent villages - Badulupura, on high ground, and Sarabhumi, in the river basin - with a small reservoir and river tributary.
* People in Badulupura exclusively drank water from dug wells whereas those from Sarabhumi, from the reservoir and river. The Badulupura people contaminated the disease but not those of Sarabhumi! Further, as from 2015 November, 25 families from Badulupura with CKDu patients were provided with tanks for rainwater harvesting which they did meticulously and used the water for cooking and drinking; and by the end of 2017, it was reported that no new cases of CKDu were reported from these families. There is evidence of high fluoride and hardness in the well water far more than that in river or reservoir water, and fluoride is known to be nephrotoxic. So the simple answer to CKDu is to provide safe potable water to the affected areas.
Most importantly, the Pesticide Technical Advisory Committee comprising experts on pesticides from all leading agricultural research institutions in the country, had recently reviewed at length the available evidence on the matter and written to the Agriculture Minister that there is no evidence to link glyphosate and CKDu and that the agriculture of the country is seriously afflicted by the ban in view of there being no alternative cost-effective technologies to control weeds. Previously, the National Academy of Science and the Centre for Education and Research on Kidney Diseases, University of Peradeniya (CERTKiD) too wrote to the government that there is no evidence to implicate glyphosate in CKDu. For that matter, this disease is prevalent in several countries - India, Egypt and several Mesoamerican countries - but none has banned glyphosate on the grounds of CKDu.
It is sad that the government is wavering on making a decision on lifting the ban on glyphosate because of undue interference of anti-science zealots.

Grace Kelly
Grace Kelly, blonde and popular, was one of the world's biggest stars when she was plucked by Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956. She retired from acting at 26 to become a princess, decamping to the tiny, well-heeled Mediterranean principality on the Riviera.
To say the union on that April 19 whipped up attention is an understatement. It was one of those weddings of the century. Alfred Hitchcock, one of Kelly's film directors, reportedly said of the marriage he was 'very happy that Grace has found herself such a good part.'
Kelly was reportedly accompanied by relatives, bridesmaids, a poodle and more than 80 pieces of luggage when she set off for Monaco aboard the SS Constitution. Thousands bid her farewell, with thousands more greeting her on the streets of Monaco eight days later. Hitchcock and other directors courted Kelly to act again after her marriage, but the prince reportedly objected. On September 13, 1982, Kelly suffered a stroke and lost control of her car on a steep, winding road as she and their youngest child, Stephanie, drove back to Monaco from their country estate. They careened down a 120-foot mountainside.
Stephanie was injured. Kelly died later in a hospital. She was 52. The royal couple had two other children: the eldest, Princess Caroline, and Prince Albert.

Healing the failing hearts
Gift of Life International, CEO, Rob Raylman visited Sri Lanka recently to discuss and extend the ongoing support of the organisation to Sri Lanka. The Rotarian-based organization which operates with a global mission to heal the failing hearts of thousands of children assured the organizations support for the waiting list of children with congenital heart problems at the Lady Ridgeway Childrens Hospital in Colombo.
In 2016, The Gift of Life Sri Lanka funded the After working hour cardiothoracic surgery program at the Lady Ridge Way Childrens Hospital by paying US$ 1,000 per surgery. With this initiative, the organisation was able to fuel hope for children with congenital heart problems by enabling them to undergo heart surgery before they reached adulthood.
The organization has sponsored a two phase nurse training programme at the Lady Ridgeway hospital as there is a need to enhance the skills of the critical care nurses in order to improve patient outcomes.
Due to certain logistical issues that are being sorted out at the Lady Ridge Way Hospital, Gift of Life Sri Lanka with the help of donors performed 23 heart surgeries on children at Asiri Surgical Hospital recently.
It is estimated that in Sri Lanka, for every 1,000 newborns, there are 6-8 born with congenital heart problems (CHD).For a total of 329,000 live births occurred in Sri Lanka, 2,000-2,700 children are born with CHD each year. Two thirds out of them (about 1,300-1,800) will need surgery/intervention for their heart lesions to be corrected. With treatment, 85-90 per cent of them reach adulthood.
Commenting on the visit, Rob Raylman said We are proud to see the commitment and the leadership displayed by local health professionals towards this cause. Since 1975, through our global network of caring, we have provided hope to more than 30,000 children with the help of our 81 affiliates around the world. I would like to extend my gratitude to Director Gift of Life International, Jay Liyanage, Attorney-at-Law Nithi Murugesu who created the framework for Gift of Life Sri Lanka, Vice Chairman Asoka Wickramasinghe who facilitated the meeting with the Health Minister, Director Doulat Kundanmal who put the initial effort during GOL-SL formative stage, DGN Karunakaran for assisting with fund raising initiatives, Dr. Ramasubbu who was an instrumental fundraiser and innovated the alternative location site at Asiri Surgical Hospital, Rotary Club President Chamath Kulasinghe, Tara Cooray, Directors, Nimal Samrakkody and Rajiv Walpita, Niran Nugara and Theresa, Nedra Wirkcremasinghe, Heinz Reuter, and Honorary Rotarian Zarani and his camera crew for capturing every child treated.

Following an inter-parte hearing into a writ petition filed by former Defence Secretary Gotabhaya Rajapaksa, the Court of Appeal yesterday further extended until May 26, an Interim Order preventing police from acting against Gotabhaya Rajapaksa under the Public Property Act over a complaint that the D.A. Rajapaksa Museum and Memorial in Medamulana was built using public funds amounting to Rs.90 million.
However, this order will not make an impact on Police investigations in respect of other aspects which does not come under the Interim Order.
The Court upheld the petitioners version that the certificate issued under Section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act is ultra vires or violative of petitioners legitimate expectations.
The Court of Appeal Bench comprised Justice (President) Preethi Padman Surasena and Justice Shiran Goonaratne.
The respondents were directed to file their objections against the petition on April 23. The petitioner was directed to file his counter objections against the respondents objections on May 14. The matter was fixed for argument on May 25.
Rajapaksa cited IGP Pujith Jayasundara, CID Director Shani Abeysekara, FCID Director Ravi Waidyalankara and the Attorney General as respondents.
Rajapaksa also seeks an order in the nature of a writ of prohibition preventing the respondents from proceeding or relying upon the certificate filed under and in terms of section 8(1) of the offences against the Public Property Act against him.

KEEPING POLICE MORALE HIGH
In the recent Digana incident that led to mayhem in the Kandy District, the flashpoint had been the bailing out by the Digana OIC of the four drunken youths who had allegedly assaulted a lorry driver. The latter happened to be a Sihalese and the suspects Muslims. When the suspects had been bailed out, the injured driver had been in a serious condition in hospital.
Why did the police treat the suspects lightly A motorist causing serious injury to a pedestrian in a road accident where the pedestrian is blatantly at fault, the motorist is not released in this manner. He is detained in a police cell and produced before a magistrate at the convenience of the police.
One would usually have expected the Senior officers of the Digana OIC to have been surprised at the quick release of the suspects. Equally surprising is the fact that the police media spokesman has not come out with the reason. The public would like to know whether an inquiry was held and what were the findings. Had the OIC been bribed Had a senior officer ordered bail Had a politician intervened Why did the Police of the District fail to promptly assess the sensitivity and explosive nature of the situation that led to the eruption and spread of violence
Being a police blunder of national importance the failure of the Police Commission to initiate an investigation to ascertain the extent to which the police are culpable compels me to reasonably conclude that a politician of importance is involved!
Rabid racist organisations
Considering the fact that the countrys culture of public life has got sucked into the bottom of a cesspool it is reasonable to surmise that no investigation other than by a Special Presidential Commission comprising men and women of eminence and proven integrity will have the courage to fault a politician. Admittedly the Bond Commission is a noteworthy exemption. But that too galloped gracefully for some distance and trotted to a halt without reaching the winning post. The job was incomplete!
A question of immense concern arises with the public allegations and insinuations that the police failed to act with commitment when places of worship, shops and residences were being attacked and set on fire with impunity by criminal mobs. Whilst looking for a scapegoat, with evidence of rabid racist organisations with links to political big wigs and a handful of deviant politicos emerging, the governments search for a huge carpet to shove the dirt under is also going on.
If a few irresponsible politicians and a sprinkling of hate goons and religious rabble linked to extremist political entities are able to transform the Sri Lanka Police that boasts of a proud history into a numb and moribund organisation it does pose a serious challenge to the governance of this country. With the recent shootings at Katunayake and Rathupaswela (albeit unlawfully by the Army) haunting the Police, guns have fallen silent. In the face of an apparent leadership vacuum the police seem to be under the delusion that they need orders from above to open fire even at violent mobs committing murder, grievous hurt or arson. Lacking in the knowledge of the law or acting on wrong instructions they readily shoot down motorists who may even unwittingly ignore a signal to stop. These roadside police shootings are manifestly illegal.
Police shooting at a mob committing acts of arson, murder, serious damage to property etc. is well within the law. Even a lone armed constable does not need orders from a superior to open fire under such circumstances.
Frenzied killers
Firing at a riotous mob is the only way to prevent the riot spreading resulting in further mayhem. Shooting to kill is the surest deterrent. And this is perhaps the only way to drive into the heads of frenzied killers that police mean business.
Barely one month after having learnt the above at the Police Training School that I entered as a Probationary ASP on 1st Feb. 1958, I happened to be thrown to the deep end when communal riots of a devastating nature broke out in May. With S.O.L. Gunatilleke the SP of Kalutara proving inadequate Stanley Senanayake, Director of Police Training was appointed by DIG Sydney de Soyza to oversee the District. With a state of Emergency on and Sir Oliver Goonatilleke in total command, Shoot to kill was the order when I being the only Sinhalese among the Probationary ASPs was put in charge of a substantial chunk of the coastal area up to Waskaduwa north of Kalutara and Bentota to the South.
Kalutara Town, Maggona and Beruwala were particularly bad. At Maggona Police had shot and killed a renowned prostitute well known as Parashute when she was leading a gang of arsonists who were carrying cans of petrol.
Shooting with heavy, outdated, WW II Enfield.303 Rifles that gave a stinging recoil was shunned by constables who had the minimum of practice. With the G.A. Kalutara, A.M.S. Perera and the AGA Francis Pietersz extremely supportive, I was able to get about twenty shot guns and adequate No. 4 and No. 8 Cartridges from the Kalutara Kachcheri. One evening I myself fired at a crowd attempting to break into the Kalutara Pharmacy when the curfew was on.
Solely due to the unwavering leadership of Sir Oliver and his delegation of full authority to the Police, the riots that threatened to devastate the entire country soon subsided. Bandaranaike came out of virtual hiding. No death count was made. No enquiries or habeas corpus applications followed. Within a few weeks the country was back to normal.
In July 1983, when riots broke out at the Borella Kanatte I was in overall command of the Colombo Police as the DIG Metropolitan. At the helm of the state was executive President J.R. Jayewardena owing allegiance to voters. Unlike 1958 here was a powerful President, but because of his voter dependence a lame duck. SWRD, was able to side-step and hand over the baby to OEG perhaps the wisest state official we had in the 20th Century. Had the arrogant JR listened to IGP Rudra Rajasingham and General Sepala Attygalle, declared Emergency and imposed a curfew when the mayhem was approaching the Borella bazaar the police would have been able to act more effectively, albeit woefully short of manpower. The Army stunned by the Tinnavelly disaster was in a mutinous mood. This too was a worrying factor. Never had I seen JRJ in such a dejected and helpless mood.
Transparent inquiries
Although the country had suffered an irreversible set-back as never before in recent history he was convinced that the Colombo Police had done their best. It did not take too long for the OICs of all the Colombo Police Stations to be promoted to the rank of ASP. I am happy that most of them ended up as DIGs, Police morale continued to remain high.
If there are shortcomings on the part of the Police, condemning commissions or omissions by insinuation is cowardice. From the beginnings police officers have been punished under the Police Disciplinary code after full and transparent inquiries. Aimless general condemnation of the police by politicians, civil rights leaders and some sections of the media can be demoralizing. Demoralizing the Police can well be part of a well thought out sinister subversive plan. I trust the police intelligence units are alive to this.
When it comes to bad driving on the roads police are blamed. The authority issuing driving licenses is not even thought of. It is well known that politicians are behind the illicit timber trade, illicit sand and gem mining, cattle rustling, illegal land reclamation and even brothels and massage clinics! The broad brush used against the police is not used against these rotters. For the existence of the underworld, too the police are blamed. But who created the Kudu Rajas, Mandi Challis, Goni Billas, Wambottas etc. Your guess is as good as mine. Not many weeks ago concrete evidence emerged proving the connection of politicians to the underworld. Did not a senior minister attempt to brow beat the STF Chief for attempting to arrest a notorious underworld criminal Perhaps the minister was unaware that the incumbent STF head is the most respected Senior Officer in the Police today.

Lankas forex reserve increases  to US$ 7.9 bn in February
Sri Lankas forex reserve assets increased to US$ 7.9 billion in February 2018, above the average four month import bill value of US$ 7.4 million
Meanwhile during the period the CBSL has offered and accepted SLDBs 50% lower than its maturity.The delay in issuance of much anticipated US$ 2 billion Sovereign Bond and extending the closing date of Foreign Currency Term Financing Facility coupled with heavy net foreign outflow from capital markets; both equity and debt amounting to over US$ 100 million has resulted in the continuous widening of trade deficits.
The above factors are likely to result in a considerable dip of approximately US$ 300-400 million in forex reserves, bringing the reserves very close to the minimum level, which is four months of imports (which is US$ 7.4 million), thus significantly aggravating the economic risk profile of the country.
However, private sector credit growth continues to be sluggish with no signs of acceleration and inflation (even if a fuel price hike is incorporated ) is expected to be within the bands of 4%-6%.
GDP growth for 4Q-2017 released in March 2018 saw growth continuing to be below par at 3.2% even slower growth than the previous consecutive quarter (3Q) of 3.7%.

LB Big Wheels Motor Show to take place on May 18-20
The LB Big Wheels Motor Show, a one-of-a-kind motor show that focuses on providing only superior quality vehicles from the worlds leading automotive manufacturers, is set to take place on May 18-20, 2018 from 10am to 10pm at the Nelum Pokuna - Colombo 7.
The inaugural LB Big Wheels Motor Show is organised by Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL), the leading voice representing the brand-new and reconditioned automobile importers in Sri Lanka and powered by LB Finance, one of Sri Lanka's most trusted financial institutions.
The motor show will showcase a diverse range of small cars, luxury sedans, all sizes of SUVs, powerful jeeps and even supercars.The show will include over 35 stalls and a total of over 200 brand new and reconditioned vehicles including hybrid and electric models.All the leading makes and models from Europe, Japan, Tailand and Australia will be present at the event.A broad selection of some of the finest classic cars in the island that are always a hit with automobile enthusiasts will also be made available.
The LB Big Wheels Motor Show is different to other motor shows in Sri Lanka primarily due to two reasons. Firstly, all vehicles displayed at the show will be models manufactured for the local market in the respective country of manufacture. It is widely known that vehicle manufacturers across the globe manufacture the best quality products for their domestic market. As the used car dealers of VIASL import domestic models of each make and model directly from these countries, these models are invariably of the very best quality in terms of safety standards, technology and features and are thereforefar superior to the export market models imported to Sri Lanka by franchise dealers. Secondly, during the event, LB Finance will be providing a host of special offers and deals that are tailor-made for the event, which are special rates below their current market rates.
Addressing the gathering at the press conference, Ranjan Peiris - President of the Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) stated, The Vehicle Importers Association of Sri Lanka was formed almost 35 years ago with the objective of becoming the leading voice representing the brand-new and reconditioned automobile importers in Sri Lanka. While the LB Big Wheels Motor Show is our very first attempt in putting together such an event, we wanted to make sure that it does not become yet another, run-of-the-mill motor show. Therefore, we have made it a very focused effort to ensure that we educate the Sri Lankan consumer about the top-quality brand new and reconditioned vehicles all our association members bring down while through our Title Sponsor LB Finance we are able to assist prospective buyers to purchase their dream vehicle by taking advantage of the special offers and deals available at the show. Through this motor show, they will be able to purchase a high-quality vehicle at a reasonable price with the required Euro-6 standard that we strongly believe all vehicles in Sri Lanka should possess.

Living in a lawless land
The canopy of the news bulletin on every television channel or radio at present is supported by four main columns of news - killings, accidents, drugs and hooch, and roadblock demonstrations, with a considerable extent of its inside crammed with tidbits of violence, burglary, civil commotion, natural disasters etc., while the rest is taken up by political bunkum. Hardly there is news on anything constructive and optimistic which clearly reflects what is going on in the country.
With so many incidents of violence, killings, robberies, extortions and mayhem taking place in the country regularly, it is apparent that the laws currently in force have become inadequate in thwarting the rapid rise in criminal activities. While everything seems to change with the needs of the rising population, the centuries-old legislation still remains static. One obvious reason for this is that many of those who are responsible for criminal acts are protected by politicians due to their heavy dependence on the underworld for achieving sordid ends.
The interference of politicians with the law enforcement authorities for safeguarding underworld characters they favor is a common occurrence in this country. Whoever comes to power, this deplorable situation continues to thrive, seriously affecting the police in combating crime. Instead of being rewarded, many staunch police officers who are brave enough to deal with the kingpins of the underworld get immediate transfers to difficult areas due to the influence of politicians. Corrupt politicians who outnumber the honest ones are a curse to this country and it is impossible to expect a change in this situation as many of the new entrants to this stream are also devoid of the qualities of real statesmen.
Peoples expectations
It is an open secret that politicians are behind the disappearance of those who know too well about them and it has been the fate of many missing journalists who have sacrificed their lives for exposing these nefarious characters to the public. Armed with the cloak of democracy, many politicians now have pistols instead of daggers hidden behind to suit the times. Sri Lanka is not an exception when compared to the countries of South Asia where almost anything can be bought if surplus money is spent, which includes law as well. With plentiful ill-earned money, there is noting that politicians find impossible. This is a sad truth known to many but there is hardly anything the general public can do except grin and bear under such circumstances.
Those who came to power by ousting the last regime that was on a dictatorial path with heavy nepotism in its wake too failed in fulfilling peoples expectations. The promise they gave for exposing the corrupt politicians too became a damp squib. Even after gathering enough evidence to bring the embezzlers of public funds to book, they shelved them until the time of provincial elections to make the best use of them as a tool, which in fact backfired in quite an unexpected manner, making them lose the confidence the public had in them that they would expose the wrongdoers which has become lackadaisical even at present.
The leaders of the ruling party which has become an epitome of incompatibility, have been ranting about speedy development in the country with large-scale industries and export-oriented businesses, none of which has been materialized as assured. Bringing down the cost of living and the price of commodities is but a pipe dream, but there should have been a pragmatic approach to taking away its heavy pressure through effective opportunities made available to the general public.
Dignified statesmen
However, their vision seems to have confined only to mere words, the best example of it can be had from no less a person than the president who makes so many pledges woven in fine fanciful tapestries of words while making public deliveries. They are so beautifully-worded, but in fact, there is noting more than the shiny sparks of a sky rocket - nice to behold, nothing to gain! The case is similar even with the prime minister. Pledges that span heaven and earth, with nothing in reality, have made people progressively lose the confidence they had in him. It would be futile to speak of others who come below them, as they are worse than their leaders when it comes to action.
In such a situation what can be expected by the masses Obviously, noting else but leaning against those who they had rejected once! There is no other option. This is what has been happening in this country ever since the gaining of independence. Only those who ruled this country immediately after the independence could be rightfully honoured as dignified statesmen. D S Senanayake, Dudley Senanayake and Bandaranaike belong to this exclusive class of luminaries. With their demise, the period of statesmen too came to an end and we would never see leaders of their ilk ever again in Sri Lanka. They spent their personal wealth for the wellbeing of the country, whereas the present day politicians mercilessly rake off whatever meant for the general public for their own gain.
The present political system is so chaotic that whatever the government does is hotly contradicted by the opposition. Never there has been any consensus and praise for the ruling party for the good deeds the government does at least occasionally. We should take a lesson from the western world for political coexistence which is never found in this land. The latest strategy used by the former president is to visit all the leading temples in the country and make it an occasion to air his views criticizing the government and rabble-rousing. If his sole intention is to pay homage to the prelates of the temples he visits, he should opt for a less dramatic role and discourage the paparazzi who flock around him for politically-motivated excerpts by making it clear to them the real purpose of his visit to the temple.
People in Sri Lanka are yet to be politically matured. What they do is turning from green to blue and vice versa, always keeping the red at bay! They expect to find solace through bringing the other party to power once when they are hard bitten during a particular reign. In this process, they wide open the sluice gates of polls in anger without making them hang in balance. Making landslide victories with indiscriminate voting in desperation eventually makes peoples voices drown for another lustrum. Unfortunately, this situation will prevail as long as people in Sri Lanka are politically ignorant and the light at the end of the tunnel seems very far!
We will leave the arena of politics and have a look at our society which is as chaotic as politics. When it comes to entertainment, undoubtedly television takes precedence with the main theme being tele-dramas. Many of the tele-dramas currently aired by almost all channels in this country are built around the society in which we live. Since of late, most of the tele-drama makers have begun to feel that their efforts are futile if pistol-totting characters are not included in them. Years ago, spectators could barely see a pistol but now it has become so ubiquitous that every tele-drama has one or more characters wielding this weapon.
With the escalation of violence which is also given prominence on television, where the usage of pistols or hauling of them from thugs are regularly highlighted, corresponding effort is also made to give this weapon the same stature with the multiple use of it in many of the stories seen by all alike. This may induce the young ones a craving to wield such a weapon as done by their heroes. This is the beginning of a gun culture. The possession of a weapon nowadays is not that difficult, as many of them are strewn around the country due to the war. The liking they get after seeing it in action may make them trigger-happy, which would eventually result in begetting yet another despicable and dangerous character in the society. Sri Lanka has already made a name for its crime rate, and with this new gun-culture, it would be obviously elevated to a higher level of notoriety.
Self-centered
We get to see the wanton destruction of forests and elephants by loggers and poachers protected by insensible politicians who are only interested in their personal gain with merciless disregard of the eventual damage it does to the ecosystem of the country. Indiscriminate clearance of lowlands of trees in the vicinity of high mountains has caused soil erosion and given way to landslides with the slightest rain which has not been heard of so often in the past. All this happens as people have become self-centered without respecting the laws of nature.
Since of late, the insensitive speed fiends have made the road a death-trap for other users. Mowing down pedestrians even on zebra crossings is all too common and a daily occurrence in Sri Lanka. At least there are four or five head on crashes reported from all over the island. A novel excuse of careless drivers who make so many road accidents is something strange - they have fallen asleep on the wheel Farcical, isnt it Something as such has not been heard of before! Speeding vehicles crash into houses and boutiques, while some dive straight into rivers and canals. Why the laws governing the speed of vehicles cannot be revised to suit the present conditions, taking into account the steady increase in the number of vehicles and reckless drivers While the speed fiends hog the road, helpless pedestrians have to stake their lives on the road. This dire situation should receive priority in putting an end to losing so many lives on the road.
It has become a way of life for factions instigated by politicians to use public roads to stage demonstrations. Regardless of the difficulties that stem from such an act, these insensible protesters keep the roads impassable for long hours until they are dispersed with water cannon and baton charge by the police. Those who get injured in dispersion become overnight heroes, backed by politicians who take unfair advantage of it to protest against the state for breach of democracy. What they purposefully fail to note in such a callous act is the inconvenience and despair it causes to thousands of others who are not concerned in such an act. There can be people rushing off to the nearest hospital with a patient for urgent medical assistance, to the airport to be in time for the place, or to beat the deadline of an urgent commitment, or many other important tasks. All this is lost because of one single irresponsible act. It is ridiculous that this undesirable strategy has been employed by some people as a means of settling their domestic problems as well. One such instance has been highlighted recently over the conflict of possession of the ownership of a young girl in a family. Why the authorities are dormant in enforcing law to keep protesters off public roads If the existing laws do not have strong enough teeth, it is the duty of the legislature to replace them to suit the present conditions.
This can be the only country where Buddhist monks take to the road for staging protests, steadily losing their stature. It is obvious they have become tools of political leaders who simply manipulate them indiscriminately. No other religious leaders who belong to the other two main religions in Sri Lanka have condescended so low as to lose their dignity by participating in similar incidents.
Reap political benefits
Yet another despicable act of politicians is to instigate the masses on communal grounds to wreak havoc and reap political benefits out of it, as made evident by the recent incidents in Kandy.
Rigorous laws as found in many other countries such as Saudi Arabia should be imposed in this country too if the outcome to be truly effective. This may sound harsh but the end result would be greater safety and a haven for people. It has become a habit of bringing up democracy as a shield against whatever bad done in this country. Would it be possible for the so-called democracy to bring down the rate of crime and make this country safer for people What is the use of such democracy if the entire nation is given freedom to act on its own, allowed to run wild, regardless of others who are law abiding

Mahindanandas transfer application: Notices issued on respondents
The Court of Appeal yesterday decided to issue notices on the respondents regarding a Transfer Application filed by former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage who sought an order transferring a case filed against him to any other court of competent jurisdiction other than the Colombo High Court presided over by High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga.
However, the Court did not make any interim order in connection with the Transfer Application and the matter was fixed for May 15.
The Court of Appeal two-judge bench comprised Justice Kumuduni Wickremasinghe and Justice Janak de Silva.
The Attorney General had filed indictments against Aluthgamage for allegedly purchasing a house worth Rs. 27 million at Kynsey Road, Colombo 7, over a complaint that he had allegedly purchased properties through illegally acquired money. High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga is the Colombo High Court Judge who delivered the judgment in the controversial sil redi (fabrics used by devotees to observe sil) distribution case.
Former Secretary to the President Lalith Weeratunge and former Telecommunications Regulatory Commission (TRC) Director General Anusha Palpita were sentenced to three years' rigorous imprisonment by the Colombo High Court for misappropriating Rs. 600 million of funds belonging to the TRC.
In his petition, Aluthgamage stated that High Court Judge Gihan Kulatunga was a member of the Presidential Commission (PRECIFAC) which initiated an inquiry against members of the former regime and further said that the judge would deny a fair trial.
Presidents Counsel Faizer Mustapha with Counsel Keerthi Tillekaratne instructed by Sanath Wijewardena appeared for Mahindananda Aluthgamage.
Senior State Counsel Janaka Bandara appeared for the Attorney General.

Meghan Markle is about to join more than one select group. Through her May 19 wedding to Prince Harry, she will not only become a member of the British royal familyshe will also make history as one of just a handful of Americans to become a senior royal around the globe.
Her predecessors include Wallis Simpson, who became the Duchess of Windsor when she married the recently-abdicated King Edward VIII; Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis' younger sister Caroline Lee Bouvier, who tied the knot with Polish Prince Stanislaw Albrecht Radziwill; and Rita Hayworth, who in 1949 married Italian-born Prince Ali Salman Aga Khan.
Markle is also walking in the footsteps of Grace Kelly who, just like the Suits star, was a screen star before she became royalty.
Kelly stopped her acting career to marry Prince Rainier III of Monaco in 1956, a move echoed six decades later by Meghan, who left Suits shortly after her engagement to Prince Harry was announced.

New CMCs inaugural meeting:
Mayor urges councillors to work for a better Colombo
The inaugural meeting of newly-elected Colombo Municipal Council (CMC) was held at the New Town Hall yesterday.
The United National Party (UNP) secured the highest number of votes in Colombo at the Local Government (LG) Elections held recently and former State Minister Rosy Senanayake became the first woman mayor of the CMC.
Delivering the inaugural speech, newly-elected CMC Mayor Rosy Senanayake invited all 119 councillors to join hands as one group to work to ensure that people living in Colombo enjoy better living standards. In this journey we have to face various challenges, she said.
She underlined the necessity of having a powerful central government to achieve the development goals of the CMC by adding that the good signs of a powerful central government were witnessed on Wednesday in Parliament.
I am really proud to be the mayor of the CMC for two reasons. The CMC had been under the UNP since its inception, except for a short period, and I was able to become the first woman mayor of the CMC due to the continuous struggle carried out by us to ensure 25 percent female representation in local government bodies, Senanayake said.
She further added that making Colombo the capital city of reconciliation where there are no racial or religious issues is the first goal of the CMC.
The decision to hold CMC meetings at the New Town Hall until the construction of a new council chamber in the CMC at the Town Hall premises was taken with the approval of the Attorney General.
The number of councillors within the Colombo Municipal Council has increased to 119 from 55 and the seating facilities available at the existing chamber are not sufficient for this number.

SLFP ministers yesterday unequivocally condemned the intimidation of employees at the Capital Maharaja Organisation on Wednesday night by a group of people carrying green flags.
Both Ministers Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa and Dilan Perera addressing two separate media briefings at SLFP Headquarters yesterday said Yahapalanaya promised media freedom and that should be ensured at all times.
We ask that the UNPers restrain themselves, otherwise they are going to make the Prime Minister look bad in his victory, Minsiter Soysa said.
A large gathering of people who had surrounded Capital Maharaja protested outside its gates and lit firecrackers before the police were sent in to control the situation.The government will not tolerate such actions and the President immediately despatched the STF for security, Soysa said.
Many people and media organisations took various sides on the No Confidence Motion but that does not mean that they should be attacked for that.

He said that the UNP has requested the Speaker to have the debate on the no confidence motion against all 16 Ministers on the same day.
MP Rahman said all ministers who voted in favour of the no confidence motion have been plotting against the government and that they should no longer represent the yahapalanaya government.
They are a headache to the Yahapalana government. They are in the Presidential Secretariat in the morning and they spend the night at Wijerama Mawatha. They are not loyal to the government and therefore they should leave the governement, he said.
He said the 16 SLFPers include ministers, deputy ministers and state ministers including the Deputy Speaker Thilanga Sumathipala.

NCM and its fallout
NCM and its fallout
In yesterday's editorial we commented that the No-Confidence Motion brought against Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was a blessing in disguise for the UNP. Judging by the turn of events, post NCM, this could well be the case.
With sixteen ministers and state ministers from the SLFP faction of the unity government voting in favour of the NCM, the doors have been open for the UNP, which is the dominant partner, to clean up the Augean stables.
Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senaratne is adamant that these ministers and MPs leave the government so that their positions could be filled from the UNP. The minister, of course, is justified in his demand. Having voted against their own Prime Minister (whether they like it or not) they have no moral right to hold onto their ministerial portfolios anymore. Besides, these ministers are known critics of the government, while enjoying all perks and privileges of ministerial office. They have been criticizing Cabinet decisions and policy decisions continuously. These criticisms, from within, no doubt, played a not insignificant part in the outcome of the LG polls.
They have also being playing footsie with the Rajapaksa camp. Susil Premajayantha, in particular, had been a vociferous critic of the government, and, the Prime Minister from the very inception, while Dayasiri Jayasekera who presided over Cabinet news briefings as co-Cabinet Spokesman was next seen at SLFP media conferences tearing the government apart. These ministers, who had been running with the hare and hunting with the hound, can no longer have the best of both worlds. They ought to quit, if they have even a semblance of honour.
But, it appears they are determined to stay put. Speaking to journalists at the parliamentary complex, following the defeat of the NCM, they had the brass to say that although they voted to oust the PM they would still remain ministers, since it was the prerogative of the President to either retain or remove them. Dayasiri Jayasekera said; Until the President decides we would remain as ministers. This is a unity government where both parties are in the government.
By implication, Jayasekera, therefore, has conceded that they were still in the unity government although they voted in favour of the NCM. He obviously has overlooked the fact that a UNITY GOVERNMENT means just that. There cannot be factions in a unity government. Now that they have breached this UNITY by declaring their no confidence against the leader of the dominant partner in the unity government, their continuation in the Cabinet is untenable.
His colleague, Susil Premajayantha, who recently said that the SLFP ministers who supported the NCM against the PM would relinquish their ministerial portfolios, is now singing a different tune. According to him, the bond issue took place during the period of the government's 100 day programme when they were not ministers. He said; That scam happened during the 100 day programme. We were not in the government at that time. We joined the government on August 17, 2015. It was because President Maithripala Sirisena decided to form a consensual government that we joined.
Surely the minister cannot expect any sane person to accept this defense. Premajayantha had served in the Cabinet from August 17, 2015, as he himself admits. The first instance where the alleged bond issue took place was in February 2015. This was followed by the second one in April. Talk about the alleged scam was very much in the news, with MPs such as Bandula Gunawardena making exposure after exposure, during the general election campaign, though it failed to impact on the public. Premajayantha, too, was very much a key player in this great exposure, but did not hesitate to accept a ministerial portfolio, after the elections.
Thereafter, the bond issue went onto become a hot topic with the Premajayanthas and the Gunawardenas going to town about the extent of losses suffered by the state and those responsible, mentioning even the name of the Prime Minister. A Presidential Commission was appointed and witnesses made to testify, with ministers and the PM summoned before the Commission. During all that time (two and half years) Premajayantha did not have any qualms in serving as a Cabinet minister. Therefore, not been a minister when the scam occurred is no defense to continuing as a minister having full knowledge of the alleged scam. There is no justification for Premajayantha to still remain a minister, after all that has transpired (regarding the bond issue)
Be that as it may, Premier Wickremesinghe has vowed to continue with the unity government with what is left of the SLFP, in order to fulfill the January 8 mandate. Such an eventuality will see the composition of the Cabinet stay at 45 ministers. There are 25 SLFP Ministers and state minister who absented themselves during the vote. If they decide to continue, at least some of them will have to be accommodated in the Cabinet, a prospect that would not be to the liking of the UNP MPs.
A new Cabinet is to be sworn-in on Monday. The public can look forward to interesting times ahead, in the country's political firmament.

NCM strengthened government, UNP: Sagala
The failed Joint Opposition No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister helped strengthened both Government and UNP. This will enable the UNP to start its victorious march forward project management, Youth Affairs and Southern Development Minister Sagala Ratnayake said.
Minister Ratnayake made this observation when he visited Weligama to inspect construction work on the proposed new Weligama Police Station. Minister Ratnayake laid the foundation stones for the building during his tenure as Law and Order Minister.
Minister Ratnayake, who said that they were aware of the outcome of the No Confidence Motion beforehand, took steps to further strengthen the opposition to it. Finally, it helped the UNP rally all forces to undertake development work during the next two years since the last three years had to have spent on planning.
He said the foundation had now been laid to ensure a prosperous life to the people in future. He said the UNP had a firm resolve to in all forces to work for the country's development. Their ambition was to work in close cooperation with the President. He said they would take steps to safeguard the party apparatus by completing re-organisation activities after wide discussions on Saturday and Sunday.

No-Confidence Motion: debate, result and consequences
The tragi-comic opera known as the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister is over. It is tragic that the politicians were using the hapless masses as pandu in their power game.
It is comic in that unlike in the proverbial story in which a lone boy alone was able to see what the Emperors new clothes were, in this drama anybody could observe that many a dramatis personae, both saints and villains, were dressed in Emperors new clothes.
The NCM was definitively defeated with 122 voting against, 76 voting for and 26 abstentions- a result contrary to the expectations of the Joint Opposition (JO) who proposed it. Instead of displaying no confidence the result fortified the confidence of the House in the Prime Minister. Instead of widening the divisions within the ruling UNP, it has strengthened that partys cohesion. It has also brought near to fruition a reform of the UNP though its nature cannot be predicted yet.
It is significant that almost all MPs representing non-Sinhala communities opposed the Motion indicating their continued displeasure of the politics of the JO. Yet their support to the Prime Minister was qualified, as it was revealed during the debate. They, like many who genuinely represent the 6.2 million voters of 2015 January who brought the present government into power were disillusioned.
The debate which lasted full 12 hours was a right royal mud-slinging match in which one sides allegations against the other were answered with counter-allegations by the other, with no one attempting to clear their names by disproving the allegations.
Local government polls
Amidst all cheers, jeers and catcalls, there was consensus that the Yahapalana Government had under-performed, that it had not lived up to its pledges and much needs to change. Excepting for additional reasons put forward by the JVP Leader during the debate, the wording of the NCM was so couched in broad general terms which softened its impact. During the debate the question was raised why it took so long for the JO to bring the NCM since the bond issue happened almost three years ago. Perhaps the victory at the local government polls would have imbued them with over-confidence, especially in view of the election debacle of the ruling parties. What the JO had forgotten was that the local government election result was the peculiar product of marketing a single product- the image of the former President, which focus was lost in bringing the NCM.
Ideologues of the JO were dramatizing the moment of the NCM with one so-called political analyst claiming that two camps will arise in Sri Lankan politics on the night of April 4th and a new equation of political forces would emerge with all decent and ethical people in politics supporting it. Despite the wide mosaic of political formations in the Sri Lankan horizon and the omnipresent gyrations of politicians across the spectrum he was dead sure that the JOs new political alliance would dominate the scene and was dividing everyone in two camps  those supporting it and those opposing.
Perks and privileges
As it stands today the only change that may result from the NCM is the departure of several Ministers and MPs from the official SLFP to join the JO or the SLPP. In effect it would not amount to anything new since the former was right along collaborating with the JO from its inception and was only waiting for an opportune moment to cross over.
The JOs stakes in the NCM were much larger than the ouster of the Prime Minister. They were boasting of the certain collapse of the Government and the hastening of their eventual return to power. However, the two full moons are still far away!
Perhaps they may have been encouraged by certain actions taken by the President such as the transfer of the Central Bank from the Policy Planning Ministry under the Prime Minister to the Finance Ministry and disbanding Economic Affairs Committee of the Cabinet. Its over-estimation of the strength and capabilities of the collaborators in the official SLFP would have been a factor that motivated them. The President has obviously had second thoughts and retreated at the last moment to escape embarrassment and humiliation in case the NCM was defeated.
Hence, the explanation for the large number of abstentions for which interests in retaining or gaining portfolios and perks and privileges of office too would have had an influence.
After the local government elections this column predicted that the Government would carry on despite the election debacle but refrained from speculating on the outcome of the NCM. However, it has no guarantee that the Government would amend its ways and return to the track laid out in January 2015. Much more is expected from the civil society if that is to happen. Wanted is a socio-economic movement of the masses that would have the objective of forging national unity, eliminating corruption and establishing the Rule of Law, preventing the country sliding into anarchy and turmoil.
With both the UNP and the SLFP debilitated the SLPP would be the only organised force on the Right despite its anti-imperialist rhetoric.
Its overt racist tones and flirting with ethno-religious fundamentalism makes its ascent to power a dangerous prospect as seen from recent developments in several countries in South Asia and Europe.
This underlines the imperative need for Left unity as only a united Left could be a viable alternative to the racist JO cum SLPP. It is such unity that could bring about a new balance of political forces and lead to a broad alliance of democratic forces, including those among all communities and religions.

Cabinet Paper soon to ban tuition classes during school hours

Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said a Cabinet Paper will be presented in Parliament shortly to ban private tuition classes during school hours between 7.30 am and 1.30 pm.
The minister said this in Parliament yesterday in response to a question raised by MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara during the round of questions for oral answers.
The minister noted that private tuition classes has become a fashion and as such children attend these tuition classes by not attending school.
According to the minister, the majority of existing shortages of principals and teachers have already been filled and 4,000 principals have also been recruited.
Usually, students can sit for their A/L examinations twice through their respective schools, but we are looking into the possibility of allowing students who were affected by the recent floods to be given the opportunity to sit for their A/L examinations for the third time through their schools. We are discussing this possibility with the Examinations Department, Minister Kariyawasam said.
Meanwhile, raising a supplementary question, Matara district MP Buddika Pathirana said that in Matara, the 80 percent attendance for A/L students is strictly adhered to but the students who were affected by the floods have been unable to fulfil their 80 percent attendance requirement.
He further noted that due to the floods, some of the A/L students in the Matara district were unable to even apply for the A/L examination and several schools were facing this predicament.
In response, the Education Minister asked for details of schools that had faced this issue and said that if these schools had been affected, the Principals should submit such information to the Education Ministry and obtain a solution to the issue.

Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill postponed

Debate on Judicature (Amendment) Bill due yesterday was postponed until the inconsistencies pointed out by the Supreme Court (SC) in the bill be properly amended and presented to Parliament.
Leader of the House Minister Lakshamn Kiriella informed the House that the Judicature (Amendment) Bill will not be presented until the necessary amendments are drafted.
The SC recently determined that three sections of the Bill are inconsistent with the Constitution and need to be passed by a two thirds majority in Parliament. The SC has determined that Sections 12 A (1), 12 A (2) and 12 A (7) are inconsistent with the Constitution.
The Government presented the Bill on March 6 to set up a permanent High Court-at-Bar to expedite cases of large scale corruption and financial crimes.
Deputy Minister Ajith P. Perera speaking on the bill said that some may have misunderstood the determinations given by the SC. He pointed out that there is only a matter with regard to the two thirds majority and a simple majority when passing the Bill. There is no refusal on the proposed permanent trial-at-bar system or the anti-corruption high court.
He said the Legal Draftsman Department has requested time to draft the amendments needed in the Act, as determined by the SC. Initially, they were only given two days, which is not enough. They have requested more time on this, and we will present the Bill to Parliament in due course," he said.
Deputy Minister Perera said the establishment of the Anti-Corruption High Court is timely. Some groups cannot tolerate it, he said.
The establishment of these high courts was strongly challenged at the SC. I need to commend J.C. Weliamuna PC, Saliya Peiris PC, Jayampathi Wickremeratne PC, lawyers Pulasthi Hewamanna, Suren Fernando, N. Kodithuwakku, V. Corea, J. Anagaratnam, Shamika Jayawardena, who appeared on behalf of the State without any charges. I should also thank the talented Attorney Generals Department officers who countered the arguments to establish these high courts,the Deputy Minister said.
Supplementary allocation seeking Rs. 7,000 million tabled in Parliament
The Supplementary allocation seeking approval of the House for Rs.7,000 million was tabled in Parliament yesterday, while certain expenditure heads in it were questioned by the JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake.
Several items in the Supplementary Allocation included that Rs.100 million was provided as an additional allocation to settle the outstanding bills of 2017 flood and drought reliefs .
According to the Cabinet decision on January 30, Rs. 1,450 million was allocated to provide further relief to drought affected people, Rs.1,500 million to implement the fertiliser subsidy programme for tea smallholders, rubber and coconut sectors.
Rs.21.39 million was allocated to procure vehicles for Sri Lanka Amarapura Sanga Sabha Mahanayake Ven. Kotugoda Dhammawasa Thera, Rs.43 million to provide vehicles for State National Integration and Reconciliation Minister, Rs.10 million to procure vehicles for the Prime Minister's security division, and Rs.342 million to settle the outstanding contractual payments to the Colombo Municipal to provide infrastructure facilities to the Shangri La Hotel project.
However, JVP MP Bimal Rathnayake Challenged certain expenditure heads in the Supplementary Allocation, including the Shangri La payment and the vehicle leased for the Minister of Special Assignments. He noted, Rs.4.1 million is allocated to the Ministry of Special Assignments to meet the expenditure of the lease rental for a vehicle procured under the operational leasing method. What did the Special Assignments minister do for the country and why he needs a vehicle. Further, we want a background report for the additional allocation of Rs.342 million to settle the outstanding contractual payments to the Colombo Municipal Council for providing infrastructure facilities to the Shangri-La Hotel project as per the Cabinet decision dated 30th January 2018.
Public Enterprise and Kandy Development Minister and Leader of the House Lakshman Kiriella responding to the JVP- MP said if required the issue could be debated at a later date.
The Supplementary allocations are provided in terms of Clause 6 (1) of the Appropriation Act strictly for the purposes specified in approved Budget Estimates, after assessing their needs, giving consideration to relevant financial regulations, and approved procedures.
However, the supplementary provision presented in Parliament yesterday did not change the approved total expenditure limits of the annual estimate. The allocation of such purposes has been made under the Project of Budgetary Support Services and Contingent Liabilities of the Department of National Budget, and it is under the limit of the Approved Annual Budget.
Spot fines for 33 traffic offences
Measures have been taken to introduce spot fines for 33 specified traffic violations to minimise road accidents and form disciplined drivers, Transport and Civil Aviation Deputy Minister Ashoka Abeysinghe said commencing the debate on the Motor Traffic Act in Parliament yesterday.
Under the Motor Traffic Act, three orders were taken up for debate.
The Deputy Minister said that for 33 specified traffic offences,spot fines will be implemented as a law. Based on the recommendations of the committee appointed by the President, the 33 offences subjected to spot fines will be introduced.
What is intended by this exercise is to create disciplined drivers and safeguard the lives of the people. Accordingly, spot fines will be imposed from Rs. 500 to a maximum of Rs. 3,000, Abeysinghe said.
Under the Motor Traffic Act orders, measures will be taken to introduce the Quadricycle which would also be included in the motor traffic law, said the minister, adding that the Gazette notification with regard to banning these Quadricycles from entering the Expressways will be issued shortly and measures would be taken to introduce an international driving licence.

PM to focus on development agenda
A jubilant Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe addressing UNP Parliamentarians and partymen at Sirikotha said that it was an opportune time to refocus on the countrys development agenda whilst restructuring the UNP so that it would be a formidable party ahead of the next elections.
I am grateful to everyone who has shown so much support, he told reporters at a celebratory breakfast at the UNP Headquarters.
It is now time for us to put the country first and accelerate the development work.
He also spoke on the UNPs reforms adding that restructuring the party would give it a strategic advantage ahead of the 2020 elections. In a rare show of appreciation, the Prime Minister personally spoke to patrons and sincerely thanked them for their unstinted support to defeat the no-confidence motion.
The Premier on Wednesday survived a No Confidence vote in Parliament after a majority of legislators numbering 122 voted to support his coalition government.
The trust vote was sponsored by the joint opposition over the premiers failure to thwart the alleged bond issue and arrest anti-muslim riots which took place last month in Digana and Teldeniya.
The Prime Minister comfortably secured the support of 122 members of the 225-member Parliament, with only 76 voting against him. His supporters included the minority parties, the Tamil National Alliance and the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress.
Meanwhile, President Maithripala Sirisenas Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) was split over the vote, with nearly 26 legislators, many from the SLFP, absent at the eleventh hour.

PRASANNA  JAYAWARDENE  - stumped  out too early
The spotlight today is on PRASANNA JAYAWARDENE. Aptly put: Reliable stumpers and batsmen dont come that easy. JAYAWARDENE came too early and left too early. Nonetheless his will remain a legend for upholding the honor of his school that made him an outstanding cricketer.
In the good old days, especially in the late 1950s and early 1960s when it came to cricket, St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa a leading Christian Brothers school produced cricketers of repute who could have held their heads high and stood up to the best.
But Ceylon selectors at that time seemed blind to outstanding cricketers emerging from lesser known schools and only focused on cricketers emerging from the big schools who the selectors of that era could be best described as 'Myopic'.
Accepted that the country was not playing Test cricket at that time. Yet cricketers from the Moratuwa school could have been considered for the odd whistle stop game or the Gopalan Trophy game that was in vogue in that era.
Selectors open their eyes
The credit for making the selectors open their eyes and look at cricket and cricketers from that school goes to who could be termed the Duleep(sinjhi) of Moratuwa and Sri Lanka cricket DULEEP Mendis.
Before going on to dwell on most of the outstanding cricketers who later sported the countrys colours, two names that could have attained stardom were a former captain of that school, that batting genius Kingsley Fernando and a leg spinner in Vere de Silva. Fernando was the captain when I captained St. Benedict's College in 1960.
Fernando made tons of runs in school cricket and later Sara cricket also playing for the university in the team that won the Sara Trophy in 1964 under Josephian Carlyle Perera.
Galaxy of leg spinners
De Silva was a right arm leg spin googly bowler who shone in the galaxy of leg spinners of that era in Michael Tissera, Lareef Idroos, Sarath Vithanaga, Raja de Silva. The writer was also a leg spinner and I would leave the judgement of his prowess to his peers at that time and to the records that should speak for themselves! . Leg spin bowling became sadly a dead art after the brilliance of D.S. de Silva the leg spinning all rounder, Captain and once chairman of Sri Lanka Cricket Interim Committee and to whose credit stands the Hambantota International Stadium and the Muralitheran stadium in Pallekelle.
But after the country played itself into the elite of Test cricket, players from St. Sebastians who made the selectors take notice were Duleep Mends, Romesh Kaluwitharne, Susil Fernando PRASANNA JAYAWARDENA and the latest Amila Aponso.
This week SPORTS LEGENDS focuses its head lights ON HEWASANDATCHIGE ASIRI PRASANNA WISHVANATH JAYAWARDENE a wicket keeper/batsman who shone in school and club cricket and caught the eyes of the selectors who were quick to give him the breaks in big time cricket.
Solid right hand batsman
In addition to his Rodney Marsh- like wicket keeping, PRASANNA was a solid right hand batsman who propped the middle order and scored runs when necessary. Incidentally to those not in the know, Marsh was one of the finest wicket keepers produced by Australia and where caught Marsh bowled Dennis Lillee would appear regularly in score books.
JAYAWARDENE was not a flashy wicket keeper. He would appear calm and collected with the gloves and would dive right or left and take regulation catches with ease and his stumping of batsmen was certain. He was a glove man and batsman any captain would love to have in his team.
As a right hand batsman he had it in him to always show the full face of the bat to ball and would seldom play the horizontal bat. The future was his to be a permanent fixture in the SL team. That he could not play much longer and show his prowess was because a few failures saw him out as Kumar Sangakkara was breathing down his neck.
Fortunate to watch
One knock of his which I was fortunate to watch was the century he scored against England in Cardiff when covering the tour for the Daily News and Sunday Observer in 2011. But that knock was not enough to save the country from defeat.
Not only did JAYAWARDENE show his class in the longer version of the game, but also excelled in the ODIS. He played in 58 Tests and only six ODIS.
In all he had 4 Test hundreds and five half tons. His three figure scores came against Bangladesh 120 not out, 154 not out against India, 112 against England and 120 against Pakistan.
As just a 19 year old he toured England and showed good form and was tipped to have a long and fruitful innings for the country. However the form of his school mate Kaluwitharne and the knocking on the door by Sangakkara saw him bow out which was sad on him and the countrys cricket.
Too tiresome
But there were Tests where wicket keeping and batting at number three for the country was too tiresome for Sangakkara and JAYAWARDENE was recalled as wicket keeper and strengthened the middle order batting.
JAYAWARDENE made his Test debut versus Pakistan in Kandy in 2000 and wore hi gloves for the last time in Tests was in Wellington against New Zealand in 2015. ODI debut vs Pakistan at Sharjah in 2003 and last ODI fling in Abu Dhabi also against Pakistan in 2007.
JAYAWARDENE played for Sri Lanka, Basnahira South, Bloomfield, Colombo Cricket Club, Marylebourne Cricket Club, Nondescripts, Sebastianites, Sinhalese Sports club and Sri Lanka Board President s X1.
Reliable stumper/batsman dont come that easy. JAYAWARDENE came too early and left too early. Pity.

Rajapaksa camp wanted to defend themselves from murder, fraud and corruption charges - JVP
The No-Confidence motion brought against the Prime Minister split the joint opposition and also undermined its recent electoral gains at local elections, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Dissanayake MP told journalists yesterday.
During a media briefing at JVP office in Battaramulla Dissanayake said only the Gotabhaya Rajapaksa camp in the JO was interested in the no faith motion while Basil Rajapaksas team had shown a lukewarm response although they had voted in favour of the motion.
The behaviour of Mahinda Rajapaksa was also very strange.When he went with other JO members to handover the no confidence motion to the Speaker his facial expressions were similar to a dog being dragged to bath, Dissanayake said.
Dissanayake went on to say that both former President Mahinda Rajapaksa MP and his son Namal Rajapaksa MP had not uttered a word during the no confidence debate or help those trying to win it.
The JVP leader charged that Gotabhayas camp was very keen to win the no confidence motion as most of those accused of major frauds and corruption was on that side.Most of those responsible for the MIG deal and other major malpractices during the previous regime are on the Gotabhaya camp.They wanted to topple Ranils government and escape from the charges levelled he added.
Dissanayake said that topics such as the current burning issues in the country, bond scam and the recent communal clashes never figured in the debate.
He said the Rajapaksa camp only wanted to defend themselves from the murder, fraud and corruption charges leveled against them.Dissanayake charged that the no confidence motion only showcased extent of the breakdown of the political system in the country.The JVP leader also observed that the no confidence motion was poorly planned.
The attempt Dissanayake said had helped the UNP to iron out its internal issues.
The JVP leader said that the no confidence motion had also created a major division among the SLFP and UPFA members supporting the President.
He said the JVP always had a very clear stance about the no confidence motion and acted in a manner which best suited the interest of the country and the people. Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna leader Anura Dissanayake.

Rita Hayworth
Rita Hayworth was a screen queen in the 1940s and a pinup idol for the troops during World War II.
She was married twice before (including to Orson Welles) and left Hollywood behind to marry Italian-born Prince Ali Salman Aga Khan.
He was known as Aly Khan and was the son of Sultan Mahommed Shah, Aga Khan III and leader of the Nizari Ismaili sect of Shia Islam.
The two wed near Cannes, France, on May 27, 1949. While she had little interest in the royal family's involvement in horse racing, she did win several races in France with a filly named Double Rose.
Things began to unravel in 1951, or so the story goes, when Khan was seen dancing with actress Joan Fontaine at the nightclub where he and Hayworth met.
She filed for a Nevada divorce that September, citing 'extreme cruelty, entirely mental in nature', and a custody battle for their daughter, Yasmin Aga Khan, ensued
Religion was the focus: Hayworth wanted to raise the child Christian and the prince offered her $1 million if she would rear Yasmin as a Muslim and allow him extended visits in Europe.
Hayworth rejected the offer, explaining that she respected all faiths but wished for her daughter to be 'raised as a normal, healthy American girl in the Christian faith'.
Hayworth was finally granted a divorce in January 1953. She died in 1987 at 68 of complications from Alzheimer's.

Royal-Joes game should be a thriller
The confrontation between the two top school rugby teams Royal College and St.Josephs College Maradana in the Singer A Division inter-schools league rugby first round match at Havelock Park today should turn out to be a thriller. The match will kick off at 4.15 pm.
Royal who came back to their normal pattern of play from the very first match against Kingswood College Kandy where they won 29 points to 5 under the coaching of dedicated and hardworking former national rugby captain Dushanth Lewke has been training really hard in the last few weeks and are determined to pull off a morale-boosting win.
Joes on the other hand started training two to three months back under the watchful eyes of their coach Nilfer Ibrahim who was also the Sri Lanka national sevens head coach some time back.
The forte of the Royal team has been their power-packed forwards. The Royal eight especially their ever green Sasitha Siyath, Maleesha Madumewan along with Himantha Hirushan, Ebrahim Barrie, Nuwan Jayawardena and Ifam Fareed have always given a terrific display in the loose but today they will be given a torrid time by the Joes forwards spearheaded by burly Shavon Gregory, John Ganegoda, Sonal Damien, Tharindu de Alwis and Nimesh Kavinda ably supported by Shehan Kelaniyagoda.
In the set scrums Royal hooker Fareed should get the better of his vis--vis Damien while the line outs should be shared between the Royal duo of Sasitha Siyath and Maleesha Madumewan and Joes Kavinda and Kelaniyagoda of Joes.
With the halves combination of Mubeen Falleel and Nikhil de Silva having clicked very well in the last few matches the Royal side will hope that Falleel will set his three quarters in motion at every turn as they have two hard running centres in Janindu Dilshan and Thulaib Hassan.
In addition they also have two experienced wingers in skipper Shabith Feroz and Yasis Rashmika who have stood out with their powerful runs down the flank with full back Dulan Gunawardena often joining the line to form the overlap.
But the Josephian speedy three quarter line is having a slight edge over the Royal threes as they have players of the caliber of cracking centres in Gamunu Chethiya and skipper Shameesha Verangana along with speedy wingers Dulanjana Piyatissa and K.D. Kavinda with ever reliable full back Shan Akila who is a safe player both in attack as well as in defence. All will depend on how their nippy scrum half Rashen Gunawardena will feed their speedy three quarter line and the kicking boot of fly half Santhush Algama.
St.Josephs will have to be at their very best if they are to beat the formidable Royal team as presently Royal looks invincible and hard to beat.
Going by the two teams starting line ups and the performances so far in this ongoing league tournament, a close tussle for supremacy can be expected today.

The earlier Games record too was set by a Malaysian way back in 2002. Indias Gururaji won the silver medal for lifting 248 kgs, a kilo ahead of Sri Lankas Lakmal.
A soldier from the Commando Regiment 28 year old Lakmal who held the Sri Lanka national record was able set a new National record with his lift of 249 kgs.
Lakmal speaking to the Daily News said that his aim was to win a medal for his country which he did. He said that was confident of a medal according to his fitness on that day. Even his coach R.B. Wickramasinghe had predicted that he would win a medal because of his strong mentality.

Sole purpose of NCM was to split the SLFP - Minister
The Sri Lanka Freedom Party which came out divided after Wednesday nights No Confidence Motion (NCM) against the Prime Minister is of the view that the sole purpose of the NCM was to divide the SLFP and not remove the Prime Minister.
The official stance we agreed on was to abstain, said SLFP Minister Mahinda Samarasinghe yesterday.
He was addressing a media briefing at SLFP Headquarters along with Ministers Ranjith Siyambalapitiya and Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa.
All three of them chose to abstain from voting. The SLFP had 16 of its members voting in favour of the NCM while 23 abstained.
UNP MPs on Wednesday night had signed a letter asking that the Prime Minister remove the SLFPers who voted in favour of the NCM from the Cabinet and government,but, Samarasinghe stressed that, this was a collective decision that needed to be made by both the President and the Prime Minister.
The Joint Opposition never consulted the SLFP or the Central Committee on this and throughout the whole process, we saw that they took no action to lobby members for it, he said.
From the start, we saw that there was something wrong with this NCM. There was no way forward proposed after this. The SLFP had not thought of a Prime Ministerial candidate if the NCM went through and neither had the UNP. Even the JO had not made it clear whether they would support us to form a new government after this. If the NCM had passed, the country would have been thrown into chaos, said Minister Siyambalapitiya explaining their reservations over the NCM.
We needed to think of the country first so we abstained, he added.
On principle we had decided that we could not go against the government whilst being in it. Hence, we asked the Prime Minister to resign on his own accord, when that failed, we made the decision to abstain, Minister Soysa added.
The NCM was clearly not against the Bond issue or the Prime Minister, the JO simply wanted to split the SLFP and go for a Parliamentary election in the wake of their Local Government victory, he explained further.
They wanted to eventually isolate the President, similar to former President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratungas government in 2001, he added. The Ministers also stressed that the President had nothing to do with the NCM and had given them a free hand to vote,
The President told the SLFP Parliamentary group meeting on Tuesday night that we needed to come to a common consensus on our vote. He said, he could not take a stance on this, as the leader of the country he had to run it on April 5 too, said Minister Samarasinghe.
When asked if disciplinary action would be taken against the SLFPers who voted in favour of the NCM, the minister pointed out that there was no basis for such action as the President had not directed them on how to vote, We all made our own choice.
Our party is like amoeba, we have had many opinions on this and we have accommodated them all,quipped Minister Soysa.
In the wake of the NCM, he noted that it was only the UNP that had come out stronger than before.
With the NCM behind them, the SLFP yesterday morning also held discussions with regard to party reforms with the President, said Minister Samarasinghe, We too, like the UNP, need to look at that in the wake of our Local Government results, he said.

Sri Lanka will remain in GSP plus trade program - EU
European delegates visiting Sri Lanka from the European Parliament painted a rosy picture of the countrys ascendance to its GSP plus trade programme, and said they were committed to continuing the reduced tariff scheme.
We are very keen to cooperate with our Sri Lankan partners and friends to keep GSP plus alive, and we are pretty certain that it will happen, said Jan Zahradil, the Chairperson of the EU Parliaments Committee on International Trade.
It was a markedly different tone from the last time an EU delegation came to evaluate Sri Lankas GSP status. In November, MPs said they were disappointed by Sri Lankas slow progress on human rights reforms, like repealing the Prevention of Terrorism Act.
But on Thursday, EU Standing Rapporteur on South Asia Sajjad Karim said we need to dispel the myth of external demands.
We demand nothing, he said. This is a journey we are undertaking as equal partners.
Sri Lanka lost its preferential GSP trade status under the Rajapaksa government amid allegations of human rights abuses and war crimes.But the EU reinstated the programme last year, on the condition that Sri Lanka abide by certain international human rights,labour and environmental conventions.
Karim said his delegation had since seen a trend of improvements and a genuine commitment being shown with systems being put in place.
He said he was promised that a replacement to the controversial Prevention of Terrorism Act would be introduced in Parliament soon. The MPs were scheduled to meet with the Prime Minster and Foreign Minister before departing on Friday.
They also met Law and Order Minister, Labour Minister, the Speaker and the Leader of the Opposition, as well as members of NGOs, trade unions, the International Labour Organization, and the Mission of the United Nations.

SriLankan Airlines is confident that they would be able to cancel the order for four new A350 aircraft from Air Bus international without having to pay additional amounts.
The new Chairman of SriLankan Ranjith Fernando said that the government has hired a top international legal team and aviation experts to discuss with Airbus in a bid to cancel this order.
The government has also paid some advances for this aircraft order and we are hoping that the matter could be settled by the end of the year.
He said that these aircraft orders and the lease agreements that were negotiated by the official of the Sri Lanka airlines during the previous government were at least 25% more than the market rates during the time.
The airline has to pay a huge US$ 750 million for the total contact.
In addition to the terms being far too high during the negotiation the wide bodied aircraft were also not suitable for the airlines current routes, Fernando said.

President Maithripala Sirisena said that plans are afoot to increase the forest density to 32 percent from 28 percent within the next three year period.
The President made these remarks on April 4 at BMICH, while addressing the employees of State Timber Corporation, which marks the golden jubilee. The State Timber Corporation (STC) has marked its 50th anniversary this year since its inception in 1968. The President while addressing the gathering said that it is needed to increase the forest density to 32 percent so as to minimise the climatic changes of the country. According to environmental experts, the country needs to have a rate of 32 percent forest density, though the present forest density rate is 28 percent.
Therefore a three year action plan to increase forest density to 32 percent will be implemented soon he said.
The President advised the STC to invest on reforestation, so as to maintain the balance situation of the environment. He further added that the present volume of import of foreign timber should be increased, aiming to save our forests and forest reserves.
President Sirisena further said that one third of the country is affected by a severe drought, which has been prevailing for more than three years. As an outcome of this situation, food production of the country has dropped. Due to the drought, the government has to import more food items including rice. The President pointed out that the world has reached a highly advanced technological level but even that advanced technology cannot heal the damages of environmental impact.
Speaking on future plans of the STC, the President advised the officials to work for achieving set goals. Meanwhile, he asked the officials to increase the number of plant beds maintained by STC for reforestation. Besides, he advised to increase and streamline the furniture manufacturing of the STC.
At the Golden Jubilee ceremony, many senior employees of the STC received gold medals as a service appreciation by the President.

Trade committee moves forward with electronic portal
The International Trade Centre held its first public-private consultation on the new national single trade window on Thursday.
The trade window is an initiative, coordinated between multiple international agencies and domestic ministries, to create a single electronic portal to facilitate trade in Sri Lanka. It is a part of a World Trade Organization Trade Facilitation Agreement that the government ratified in hopes of becoming South Asias logistics hub.
Currently, many important records of the export process are kept on paper, and often duplicated, according to Libuse Soukupova, the Head of Cooperation for the EU Delegation to Sri Lanka and the Maldives.
An efficient single window is a key aspect for all parties involved in the trade process, she said. She was speaking at a forum of government officials, business leaders, and international partners at the Cinnamon Grand Hotel.
Such reforms are not being glibly adapted, said Sonali Wijeratne, Director General of the Department of Commerce and Co-Chairperson of the National Trade Facilitation Committee. (Theyre being) made in a concentrated and comprehensive manner.
But she stressed that since the Cabinet paper approving the process was adopted in 2015, three years had passed before they had submitted key documentation to the World Trade Organization.
She said domestic agencies needed to be further empowered to complete the long and arduous reform process.
Mohamad Saeed, a senior advisor to the Geneva-based International Trade Center, added that the business community must be actively involved in the reform process.
The government makes the rules, he said. But it is the private sector that benefits or suffers. This can only be improved when there is coordination with the private sector, he added.
Dhara Wijayatilake, the Secretary General and CEO of Ceylon Chamber of Commerce, assured the stakeholders that the Chamber would always reach out to their members for cooperation. (I am) confident that this is going to work, she said.
Referencing the recently defeated No-Confidence Motion against the Prime Minister in Parliament, she said that as the political leadership is sorting out their own battles in a separate arena the burden on the public sector is increasing.
P.S.M. Charles, Director General of Customs and Chairperson of the NTFC, said that already some aspects of the single window were online, like digital payments and 24-hour service.
We know the needs, and the response, she said. We have a mandate to do this trade facilitation.
She said her committees next steps would be to implement an online signature system, and provide paperless documentation. The Customs Department is one of the organization collecting the most revenue for the Sri Lankan economy, she said. They need to activate the single window as soon as possible, so foreign exchange can be earned by our local people, she added.

Vinod, winner in 2016 and runner-up in 2017, clinched the Junior champion title for the second time, playing excellent golf in the final.
The Sri Lanka Junior Match-Play Golf Championship, sponsored by P&S Bakers for the fifth consecutive year, displayed beyond reasonable doubt the improvement and development of junior golf in Sri Lanka.
Chairperson of the junior Sub- Committee, Niloo Jayathilake said: Today, we witnessed some amazing golf by juniors with the girls final taking center stage. The first hole saw Kayla sink an amazing 20 foot putt for a birdie with Taniya Minel responding with an eagle to win the first hole. The final produced 3 eagles with Kayla making an eagle on the 7th whilst Taniya added the 11th hole eagle to her 1st hole spectacle and a flurry of eight birdies between them.
SLGU Council member Niloo also added that even the members and amateurs at the RCGC rarely produced this high standard of golf in a final as displayed by Kayla and Taniya.
Nirekh Tajwani continued his consistent performance to win the Silver Division defeating K. Danushan with consummate ease 5 & 4.
Ten-year-old Shanal Binuksha, a talented junior following in his fathers and grand fathers footsteps cruised to a 7 & 6 victory over M.S. Sanjay of Nuwara Eliya Golf Club to win the Bronze Division. Kaya Daluwatte won the Copper Division (9+ & under) for the second consecutive year defeating Thejas Rathis Kanth comfortably 3 & 2.
The Rukmini Kodagoda Challenge Trophy was given away by Gihan Perera (CEO - P&S) on behalf of the sponsors Perera & Sons Bakers. We are proud to sponsor the Junior Golf Match-play Championship in memory of the late Rukmini Kodagoda, a Family Director of P&S, said Gihan Perera.
Rukmini Kodagoda was a star golfer, tennis national champion and above all an exemplary sportswoman who was committed to developing golf from the junior level. The progress and growth of the junior golf is a tribute to the commitment of the Sri Lanka Golf Union presidents vision of laying the foundation at junior level and the untiring efforts of the Junior Sub-Committee of the SLGU focused on promoting golf among children, students and juniors.

We will leave Govt, if President says - Dilan
SLFPers who voted in favour of the No-Confidence Motion (NCM) met President Maithripala Sirisena yesterday to convey the message that they would leave the government on his terms and not according to the demands of the UNP.
The official stance was to vote in favour, State Minister Dilan Perera said addressing a media briefing with Ministers Chandima Weerakkody and Dayasiri Jayasekara at SLFP Headquarters yesterday. It followed a similar media briefing held earlier that day by Ministers Mahinda Samarasinghe, Vijith Vijithamuni Soysa and Ranjith Siyambalapitiya, who had all abstained at the vote.
We had all agreed to ask the Prime Minister to resign and when we met him and Minister John Amaratunge said that the UNP was of the opinion that the PM should stay. So we met our Parliamentary group once again and decided to vote in favour, State Minister Perera said.
Samarasinghe and Soysa were not even present at the meeting at Mahinda Amaraweeras house when we decided to vote for the NCM, added Perera.Amaraweeera in the meantime was absent when the vote was taken,Perera said.
This NCM was about the bond issue and the SLFP has always been of the stance that this deal was corrupt. Mahinda Amaraweera was the first to lodge a complaint against it. So there was a general consensus and demand from the people that action needs to be taken, Minister Jayasekara said at the briefing.
He said the number 122 was not a great victory, as 103 were still opposed to it.
Moving forward, the SLFP, according to him would work within the unity government only under certain conditions, We will not betray the partys identity and principles.
The Minister further observed that it was the President who was the head of cabinet and government and it was only he who had the power to remove or appoint ministers.
He stressed that the SLFP would stand firm on its principles and identity and would not bow down to the whims of the UNP, We did not come here to be buried with the UNP.
The Ministers stressed that whilst there was a difference in opinion with regard to the NCM, they all stood firm on the premise that all in the party would work together to take forward the partys agenda, We dont have a split, the Sports Minister said.
The two groups had also agreed on the principle that it was not ethical for the President as the head of the government to be involved in the NCM, The President was not involved, they both reiterated.
The Skills Development and Vocational Training Minister Weerakkody further observed that their vote in favour of the NCM had won them more public support, We have nothing personal against the Prime Minister. We had to make this decision for the greater good. We were ready to give up our posts when we voted, he said.
When asked what the President told them when they met, Perera said, The President was happy to see us, perhaps he thought that at least 16 SLFPers have a spine in this government.

Word of caution for the pregnant
The Health Ministry advises all pregnant mothers infected with any type of fever or flu to seek hospital admission on the very first day of the disease, Consultant Community Physician Dr. Kapila Jayaratne said.
Dr. Jayaratne advises them because of the complications that can develop if they get infected with the dengue fever or Influenza.
Complications can be avoided by seeking prompt medical treatment, he said.
The first maternal death for this year (2018) was reported last week due to pneumonia developed as a result of getting infected with Influenza. Last year (2017) around 40 maternal deaths were reported due to dengue and Influenza, he said.
The Health Ministry has already issued instructions to all doctors (both state and in the private sector) and mid-wives to admit all pregnant mothers with fever or flu to a hospital as soon as possible to avoid complications and deaths.

Worlds biggest bunny retiring from lavish lifestyle
The worlds biggest bunny rabbit and his glamour model owner are retiring together after their record winning eight year streak.
Annette Edwards, 66, who is currently the oldest UK glamour model, and her famous bunny, Darius, who is the worlds largest rabbit standing at 4ft 4inches tall, have finally decided to give up their lavish lifestyle for the simple life.
After her rabbit, Simon, died in mysterious circumstances during an aircraft flight last year, Annette was too frightened to travel with Darius and his other seven children, abroad.
And with it being Easter Bank Holiday Annette decided that the weekend would be the perfect opportunity to share the news that the pair are retiring together.
The news comes in hopes that Darius, who is now eight years old, will enjoy a less stressful life at home  though this will not hinder their Guinness World Record Titles, but Darius will no longer be available for interviews and Annette will no longer be stripping off for the camera.
The pair are hoping for an easier way of life  and plan on spending the next few weeks doing nothing but relaxing.
Annette, from Stoulton, Worcester, said: Were still welcoming tourists to visit us both but we will not be doing anymore long journeys or TV appearances. Darius has had an amazing career and loves people but now hes getting older he likes to relax. Ive done glamour modelling for over 40 years and finally feel ready to lead a quiet life, especially after tragically losing Simon last year. Darius has two children called Jeff and Grace that are likely to overtake his size and snatch his Guinness World Record in the next few years. Im sure they will love the limelight as much as their dad did.

World-class golf course at Shangri-La Hambantota
Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa recently welcomed Rodney Wright, the globally celebrated golf architect who designed the 18-hole course, spread across a vast coconut palm plantation offering spectacular views and distinctive challenges for both beginners and seasoned players. Wright visited the resort to share his expertise with the resort team, review the golf course and celebrate the accreditation of the course as it has recently been USGA (United States Golf Association) Course Rated and Slope Rated.
Rodney Wright is a firm believer in integrating the culture and environment of the surrounding area into a golf course. His goal is to design a course that people walk away from, but remember every hole.
The golf course at Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa offers three zones, each with its own unique character; The Coconut Plantation offers lush fairways and challenging bunkers, The Dune Area - with its subtle elevation changes - gives way to breath-taking views of the Indian Ocean, and The Sapphire Mine showcases generous greens with an abundance of water features.The resort also recently opened its driving range where golfers can practice their golf swing.
The course development was approached from an eco-perspective, due to the resorts dedication to biodiversity and habitat protection. The structure has revitalised an abandoned sapphire mine, restored vegetation, re-introduced birdlife and uses Paspalum grass for its salt-tolerant turf, which is resilient in the tropical climate and allows for the highest standards of course conditioning.
The golf membership at Shangri-Las Hambantota Golf Resort and Spa provides all the amenities you would expect from a world-class golf club, with different categories of membership to suit golfers preferences and special benefits at the resort.
