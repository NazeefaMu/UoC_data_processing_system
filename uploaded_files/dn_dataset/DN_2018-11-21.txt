Voice of the Silent
With an intent of conquering one of the biggest battles that the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) Hospital, Angoda-Mulleriyawa of Sri Lanka faces, that of stigma associated with mental health disorders experienced by patients, a former resident of the Institute, brave survivor,33-year-old Shmana Whittall Ferdinandus, on recovering from her infirmity formed a committee of friends and family to raise funds for the betterment of the National Institute of Mental Health Hospital by organizing concurrent awareness programmes in Colombo and Melbourne.
Aptly named the Fearless Fundraiser Events Shmana spearheads a forceful team whose Mission is to make a difference in the lives of people affected with mental health problems and to make society aware of the implications not only to those afflicted but also to the society.
In a heartwarming and unscripted delivery of her personal experience of her affliction, the time of treatment, under the purview of Consultant Psychiatrist of the NIMH Dr Mahesan Ganesan, her will to emerge from the darkness of depression, bipolar and her strength, Shmana made an impact on the audience by transmitting a live address from Australia,
Speaking on behalf of the family coping with an unpredictable and unexplainable disorder, Rajatha Piyatissa elaborated on the effects of trauma, lack of knowledge of behaviour and the slow recovery process.
Speaking at the program held in Colombo recently, the Director of the NIMH Dr Kapila Wickramanayake presented details of the many wards and specialized care by the staff to both in-house and visiting patients,
Well known Psychiatrist Dr Venura Palihawardena, MBBS MD /Psych enlightened the audience on the aspects of experiencing disorders and coping with recovery.
Psychologist Counsellor Nivendra Uduman addressed the topic of the importance of sharing ones thoughts and feelings with someone, that would help lighten the burden of depression and social stigma.
Among the speakers was Sr. Inoka Perera of ward 16 who described how it is to take care of in-house patients including Shmana and commented on how well she has recovered.
Lion Lady Shyama de Silva, MJF Past District Governor of 306 B02 spoke of the opportunities that could be funnelled through branches of the Lions Clubs to spread awareness in the country.
As a fitting finale and in lighter vein popular video comedian Eshan Dias shared his thoughts on his choice of finding happiness by means of entertaining.
Our chief guest and lovely hostess for the Colombo event, was Angela Seneviratne Theatre, Television, Cinema Artiste, Presenter and Columnist.
Proceeds collected at the event held in Colombo on November 4 were presented to Dr Venura Palihawardena by Shmanas Mother, Sherine de Run.
The committee members are now hoping to bring Fearless Charities to life in 2019 with many more quarterly events organized globally to support patient wards and the afflicted at NIMH. The committee members who approached Shmana mainly through mainstream social media after updating a post in September are  Miuru Jayaweera, Nuzhi Meyen, Manoja de Silva, Khaleeq Jayah, Daminda de Silva, Sherine de Run, Yasonil Piyatissa, Stephano Whittall and Angela Seneviratne.
Within a period of one month they were all able to bring these great events to life which has raised funds of over Rs200,000/- for NIMH which will be utilized as below;
* Providing 20 Patient cupboards for Ward 16
* The contribution of furniture for the Childrens learning & disability unit.
* Christmas party for the NIMH hospital
A small gathering of friends and family supporting the cause met over afternoon tea in Melbourne on the 10th of November - where Shmana related her story, described her Mission, showed a video presentation of the most harrowing period of her life, and celebrated her survival.
Shmana has also published a book which will be launched in February 2019 and here are a few excerpts from her close family and friends.
Shmana is a living, breathing, joyous testament to never giving up and having the courage to ask for help. Her new outlook to life (after overcoming many obstacles) is an unselfish attitude to ensure she helps as many people as possible  Nadini Soyza - Best friend
I watched my oldest friend fall into the darkest hole imaginable and witnessed every stage of it. I am so happy to see that with the help of her family she got through something most of us thought she would never recover from, I am so proud and my heart is finally at ease, Yasara Abeynayake Marija - Childhood best friend
I felt sad that such a vibrant person had to deal with mental illness. I also had no doubt that you would pull through because I knew you would put your experience to work for the good of other less privileged people. There is a reason I liken you to Mother Teresa because of your heart for the poor. "Nataliya Gunasekera - Cousin"
The mission is to help make a difference in the lives of people coping with mental illness and to make the community better aware of the implications of all mental illnesses. We will be engaging in relationship development with hospital staff, the wellbeing of the community through awareness, education, support programs and engaging in extracurricular activities for the patients and attending to their basic needs.
Our vision is to see a community and support group well aware of handling mental illnesses without judgment or social stigma and being supportive of the full recovery and wellbeing of the patients and their loved ones.

Western province, fastest  moving region in sl
The vital role in education is to change economies and entrepreneurs to do better and be more productive said Esther McIntosh, Country Director, World University Service of Canada (WUSC) at the third Western Province Entrepreneur Awards 2018 recently.
The event was organized by National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka along with the National Enterprise Development Authority (NEDA).
WUSA is also aggressively focusing on the post secondary education and to date has trained over 30,000 Sri Lankan youth to join the work workforce.
We have also partnered with 300+ private associations to support their micro and medium enterprises and the WUSA is also partnership programs with the government.
She also said that micro and small businesses need to be understood and supported. They need to be highlighted. This is a good platform to bring forth the real actors on stage since training providers are rarely recognized.
Sujeeve Samaraweera, President, National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka said, Western province is the fast moving province in the Island. Along with the numerous facilities available, the province has successfully achieved the highest profits, business and competition.
NEDA and the National Chamber of Commerce of Sri Lanka have been assisting micro, medium, small and large sectors in the region for a long time. They give a special focus towards the upliftment of these sectors in the country to develop their businesses. Also training programs are conducted for them including differently-able entrepreneurs.
This award scheme is designed to distinguish, reward and motivate Sri Lankas entrepreneurs to reach the mantle of achievement. It also encourages Micro and SMEs in the Western Province to improve their standards of business practices and achieve a higher level of entrepreneurship.
People need to be job creators not job seekers, said Dakshitha Bogollagama, Chairman, NEDA. He also said that even though only 16% university opportunities are available, the rest needs to focus on creating new jobs, which in turn would support the countrys economy. However successive changes in government and policies hinder the development of the country.
Accordingly finding the right market and packaging are the biggest issues with business people. Hence business processes needs to be developed to suit the new trends. Also mechanisms should be there to ease the business procedures.
We have to get examples from other countries, their business strategies and tactics he added. Entrepreneurship is a key factor to be developed in terms of financing and marketing.

When words become unclear
Through his eyes, the gateway, he perceives the wondrous Universe around him. And then with the passing of time, a mysterious, miraculous, marvellous and little-understood connection takes place within him. It could be instantaneous and it could take months. But his soul, his mind, his thoughts and his feelings are knitted together like a baby being conceived in the womb, and an image grows in his mind and through his hands, he draws it on the canvas. This is Expressions 15 by Jayantha Silva. Sometimes what passes through the eyes may take months to bloom after being planted in the psyche and sometimes it could take place within a few minutes.
Anyone can be a good artist, as everyone has good eyesight, muscle control, and the ability to observe and appreciate a subject. I enjoy doing paintings with charcoals, pastels and acrylics. Many are going into art as a profession to cater to the growing demand of the public to purchase original art for their domestic and corporate locations, said Silva.
Body glistening
Silvas paintings are truly beautiful. When wandering through his gallery you cannot fail to notice the mermaid picture, a glorious representation of Silvas appreciation of the nude. This is Silvas appreciation of the natural world specifically to do with lore. A mermaid is a creature of fantasy yet Silva brings her to live in our minds  her bronze larger than life body glistening in the water.
The mermaid is not the only subject of femininity in his gallery. The female figure is the subject of many of his paintings and Silva is a master of painting figures. The Universe is his teacher. It enters into his soul, imperiously commanding the gates which are his eyes to receive it, and mingling with his soul, thoughts and feelings, it produces something which is original.
I feel that the Woman alone is not the theme of my paintings. The main theme of my paintings is Expression. As womanhood is associated with the most intense emotions, there are various reasons to prefer female figures over the male. Since childhood I was always passionate about the study of the female figure, stated Silva.
Silva is a believer in God. To him, his work is an act of providence. Silva states that he is an artist because of the tremendous amount of self- confidence he has. He says that it is no doubt a Gift of God - making him fearless to draw.
Paintings basedon myth
My mermaid picture is a good example of what I am trying to say. There are many famous artists who have done paintings based on myth. Some have painted Unicorns, Cupids and even the imaginary God of Thunder. I suppose its a way how an Artist lets his or her imagination run riot, explains Silva.
Silva also never fails to include even the most minute details such as the nails of hands and feet.
The contours of the human body he captures well. The expressions on the faces of some of his subjects are so detailed you can make your own interpretation as to what that person may be thinking or feeling. His portraits are so human. So lifelike. So personal.
Silva values his freedom and gives free rein to his creativity. He is shackled down by nothing. He is bold and forever looking to express himself. Throughout the years he has done just that. Exhibition after the exhibition and surely many more to come. Because he is a man with something to say and he does that by painting.
Silvas 15th Annual Solo Exhibition will be held once again at the Lionel Wendt from November 23 to 25.

So, you want to start-up and develop a small business  Part 11
Without a business plan,  your initial enthusiasm will fade away with time
Last week, we started talking about how to write a good Business Plan. We explained to you that the Business Plan is something like a flight plan. It guides you (pilot) to reach your journey in the best path safely.
In part 1, we described how to write the Business description which included mission statement, summary of the business, legal description, and competitive edge. In part 2, we spoke about management. Part 3 had the marketing plan which included, (A) the industry at large and (b) potential customers.Today, we start from that point.
C.The benefits of your product or service
Too many businesses know exactly how to describe the features of their products or services but dont know how to point out the benefits. Todays consumers, particularly the more sophisticated ones, are more interested in hearing about the benefits of your product or service than in hearing about its features.
Suppose youre manufacturing an electric coconut scraper Dont tell me about its dimensions and its horsepower; tell me about what it will do for me that the others wont. Say youre selling a promotional product Dont tell me about where its manufactured or how much it weighs; tell me about how it can benefit the growth of my business.
D. Geography
Identify your primary geographic focus - that is, where do you expect your customers to come from Will your customer focus be within local markets District wide Nationwide Clearly, your advertising and other promotions will be quite different if youre marketing overseas rather than simply in your hometown.
E. Distribution
Explain how you intend to get your products or services to the marketplace. Describe your role in the industry and your distribution plan. Are you a manufacturer Service provider Wholesaler Retailer Will you utilize a direct sales force Manufacturers reps Catalogues Telemarketing Direct mail An e-commerce website We will talk about the information you need to answer these questions in future instalments.
F. Advertising
Identify how you can best reach your potential customers. Will you do so via newspaper, radio, television, magazines, direct mail, phone, or the Internet Which advertising methods are the most economically feasible within your budget Which ones do your desired customers most heavily utilize What internal programs or external agencies can you use
Dont forget to include your social media plan in this section. Do you intend to maintain a Facebook presence What about Twitter Linked In
G. Public relations
Public relations is the art of keeping your name in the public in a positive way other than through paid advertising. Public relations involve such activities as employee, community, industry, and government relations; customer and prospective customer relations; and - the best-known aspect of public relations - publicity.
This section of your business plan should answer the following questions: What public relations techniques will you use What is your businesss publicity hook, and why will it interest editors, reporters, and those in your target audience How will you build relationships with those in your target market, as well as with select editorial contacts How can you tap into your network of friends and business associates to build a positive image of your business and to gain editorial introductions
Within your community and in other media outlets, you can find many similar and effective public relations resources. Consider participating in a prize giving day at a local school, sponsoring a runner in a charity marathon, or designating a portion of a road to be maintained by your business. And dont forget the simple press release, alerting the media and community to worthwhile achievements of your company and its people.
H. Pricing
Explain your short-term and long-term pricing. Include information on costs and profit expectations, along with a thorough review of your competitors pricing and your perceived price-point position within the industry. Do you intend to be the low-cost provider or the high-end producer How do you intend to position your product When pricing your products, always consider the current competitive climate first. Research the pricing of similar services or products in the marketplace and then price your product accordingly.
Dont make the mistake early on of pricing your products based on some predetermined profit margin that you or your accountant would like to achieve. Instead, price your products based on what your competitive research (primarily talking to customers) determines the market will bear.
Dont be afraid to sell your services or products at healthy margins when the opportunity presents itself. Rest assured, the opportunity wont last forever.
I. Sales terms and credit policies
A sale is never complete until you deposit the proceeds safely in your business account. With this in mind, you need to spell out the terms of the sale and the conditions governing the granting of credit and the acceptance of payment before you make your first sale.
Part 4: Operations
This part outlines the nuts and bolts of the operational issues involved in managing your company. The scope of your operations or management plan covers a wide range of functions, from dealing with employees to purchasing from vendors to maintaining your companys accounting records.
A. Employees
Many small businesses are one-person operations. If you fall into this category, you dont have to suffer any of the headaches of hiring, motivating,training, and firing employees. The only person you have to worry about is you.
However, if you do plan to have employees, you need to answer the following questions in this section of the business plan: How will you assemble your team - by leasing your employees or by hiring them outright Where will you find the employees you intend to hire yourself What benefits will you offer What motivational incentives will you use Will you assemble an employee manual Will you offer a retirement plan Will there be down-the-road opportunities for ownership for key employees How will you train your employees
B. Salaries and wages
Too many small businesses hire their first employees without first devising an overall compensation plan. Such an oversight inevitably leads to a lack of uniformity in compensation. When employees perceive that youre not compensating them fairly relative to other employees and that you havent communicated an objective reason for this discrepancy, a line may begin to form outside your office.
For purposes of the business plan, you need to objectively define the basics of your compensation plan for daily, monthly salaried, and commissioned employees. Dont forget to include bonus plans and perks.
C. Vendors and outside resources
What vendors and outside resources do you intend to use How do you plan to kick off your relationship with key vendors Vendor accessibility is an important issue in many industries. Frequently, the best vendors dont make their line of products available to every customer, especially the new company just started with no history, no prior connections in the industry, and anweak balance sheet.
You need to have answers to their qualifying questions before you make your first call. Completing this section will provide you with the material youll need to respond to their queries.
D. Accounting and/or bookkeeping
Describe who will take care of your accounting and bookkeeping duties. Answer these questions: Will you hire an experienced accountant, or a bookkeeper and an experienced accountant part-time initially Do you intend to computerize your accounting system What accounting software package will you use Do you plan to outsource your bookkeeping or accounting What outside resource will you use
This section is particularly important for those businesses that intend to use the business plan as a tool to invite a loan or an investment. The smart lender or investor wants to be sure that the financial responsibilities of running the business are in good hands. This is especially true when the entrepreneur isnt particularly strong on the financial side of business.
Part 5: Risks
You, as well as potential lenders and investors in your business, should care about the potential risks in your business.
The better you understand them, the better able youll be to anticipate them, minimize them,and keep your business rolling. Risks are inherent in every business, and yours will be no exception. Identify those risks in your business plan and be candid and thorough in describing them. Investors and lenders know that every business facerisk, so theyll be looking for honesty and awareness here, not ambivalence or avoidance. They know how to recognize the difference.
Next week also we continue on Business Plan.

Worlds only sewing  machine artist
Arun Kumar Bajaj has a very unusual skill  he can paint with a sewing machine. Technically, its embroidering, not painting, but his artworks are so incredibly detailed that they could pass as hyper-realistic paintings to the untrained eye. And the fact that he does it all with a sewing machine just makes it that much more impressive.
Arun was really good at drawing and painting growing up and dreamed of becoming a famous painter, but his fathers sudden death, 15 years ago, foiled his plans and forced him to abandon school in order to run the family business. His father was a tailor and he became one too, but he didnt let the artist in him die. Instead, he started painting with needle and thread, but instead of using his hands, he decided on a rather unusual embroidering tool  the sewing machine. It took him a while to master this unique art form, but today he is recognized as the worlds only sewing machine artist.
Ive been stitching for the last 23 years, since I was 12, the 35-year-old artist said.
My father was a tailor but he died early, when I was 16, and I had to drop out of school to take over the shop. I was good at sketching in school, and this was a way I could combine the two arts.
I didnt want to remain just a darzi (tailor) all my life, Arun added.
I wanted to make a name for myself, even though my obsession has caused financial uncertainty to my family.
Luckily, his perseverance paid off, and his works became sought after both in India and abroad. Its easy to see why, just by looking at them, but what really makes his embroideries special is the tool he uses.
Many countries around the world have a rich tradition of embroidered tapestries, and you could probably find a few to rival Arun Kumar Bajajs in detail, but good luck finding any that were made with a sewing machine. You wont, and theres a good reason for that.
You need to be very precise because once youve stitched the cloth, theres no way you can undo it, Arun said.
I also dont overstitch  its all done in a single layer to give the painting a neat look.
Some of the Needle Mans most impressive works include a 64 feet painting of Lord Krishna, which took 3 years and an approximate of 28,39,000 meters of thread to complete, or a 42 feet painting of the court of Ranjit Singh, the fabled Maharaja of the Sikh empire, featuring nearly 2,000 human figures. The latter took the artist over a year to finish.
Arun runs a tailoring business in the Adalat Bazar of Patiyala, but he dedicates a lot of his time to his artistic pursuits as well. You can check out more of his amazing sewing machine paintings on his Facebook page.

Election crucial to restore order to country
An election should be held immediately, heeding the peoples demands, to provide a solution to the chaotic situation in the country, Ven. Kiriibbanare Vijitha Thera said.
The thera said so while taking part in the Bodhi Pooja Pinkama held at the Fort Sambuddhaloka Vihara on Monday.

The ven. thera said that the country was on the verge of a political, social, economic and cultural crisis.
People from all walks of life in the country expect the establishment of a stable government as a solution to the crisis. The Buddhist clergy request President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa to build a stable government for all the people in the country.
The thera added that if an election was not called, the country would degenerate further, nationally as well as internationally. We want someone, irrespective of party politics, who would stabilise the country, Ven. Vijitha Thera said. We respect Mahinda Rajapaksa for his leadership to eradicate terrorism despite international influences.
We wouldnt have been able to hold this pinkama here if he hadnt done so he said, Two bombs went off near this place in the past. Everybody respects him for the services he rendered to the people.
Ven. Kirinde Premasiri Thera of the Fort Sambuddhaloka Vihara, Leagal Director of Lake House Rasanga Harischandra, General Manager Abaya Amaradasa and Pragathisheeli Sevaka Sangamaya Lake House Branch President Chandana Bandara also participated in the event.

As there is no drug shortage in the Western Province, therefore it is impossible for any provincial hospitals to suffer any drug shortage, Western Provincial Health Services Director Dr. Anil Samaranayake said.
According to National Hospital of Sri Lanka (NHSL) Director General Dr. K. Wickramasinghe, there is no drug shortage in the Colombo National Hospital.
Government Medical Officers Association Media Spokesman Dr. Samantha Ananda also affirmed that that there is no drug shortage in any state hospital in the country at present.
Some doctors and officials pointed out that artificial drug shortages can be created by people with vested interests by not informing the relevant authorities at the Medical Supplies Division (MSD) of the drug requirements in the drug supply chain and turning back patients stating that the prescribed dug is not available in the hospital.

Over 25 per cent schools will have proper sanitary facilities soon
The World Toilet Day was marked on November 19 worldwide. The Health, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine Ministry in Sri Lanka will ensure that every family in the country gets proper sanitary facilities. Under this years World Toilet Day theme When Nature Calls, over 25 per cent of schools in Sri Lanka will be facilitated with proper toilets in the near future.
The United Nations sources say an estimated 4.5 billion live without a safe toilet and 892 million people still practise open defecation.
The Health Promotion Bureau said that in Sri Lanka 0.7 per cent of schools have no toilets and 25.1 per cent of schools do not have enough toilet facilities. According to Health Ministry statistics, 2,182 cases of dysentery and 432 cases of enteric fever have been reported to its Communicable Diseases Unit.
The resolution declaring World Toilet Day titled, Sanitation for All (A/RES/67/291), was adopted on July 24, 2013. It urges UN Member States and stakeholders to encourage behavioural change and to implement policies to increase access to sanitation among the poor, along with a call to end the practice of open-air defecation, which is extremely harmful to public health.
This years World Toilet Day campaign is on the narrative, When nature calls, we need a toilet. But billions of people do not have one. This means human faeces, on a massive scale, are not captured or treated  contaminating water and soil that sustain human life. We are turning our environment into an open sewer. We must build toilets and sanitation systems that work in harmony with ecosystems. CHW

Speaker Karu Jayasuriya breaks the criminal law. He is dreaming that he can become the common candidate for the next Presidential Election, Counsel Premnath C. Dolawatte said.
He was addressing a press conference in Colombo yesterday evening.
He asked who will pay the money wasted on illegal Parliamentary proceedings if the gazette notification by the President comes to effect from December 7. Parliament had heated brawls and parliamentarians were hit with chairs in the era of late Sir John Kotelawala. Then all chairs in Parliament were fixed to the floor.
Counsel Dolawatte said many impeachments and no confidence motions were brought in Parliament in the past but all were brought following the parliamentary rules and regulations. Now all regulations are violated.
We request the Supreme Court to allow a general election and issue an order stating that everything took place in the Parliament during the stay order is null and void, he said.
Seventy MPs will lose their pension if Parliament is dissolved and of them, 45 are UNP members. This will be their final attempt to keep their pensions. While oppositions in other countries shed blood to get elections, here in Sri Lanka, they shed blood to avoid elections, he said.

He said their reunion was a long-awaited expectation of the people, the Maha Sangha and other religious clergy. He said the only person who has maintained the identity of the country is Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, who is a fully-fledged leader who brought an end to the barbaric LTTE terrorists.
The minister added that the new government has a short term of office.
The government needs to be strengthened. It must go before the people at the earliest possible date, he said.

SL Produce & Food Mart  on Nov. 28 in Bahrain
The Ambassador of Sri Lanka to the Kingdom of Bahrain, Dr A. Saj U. Mendis, met with the Minister of Labor and Social Development of the Kingdom of Bahrain, Jameel bin Mohammed Ali Humaidan, and Zayed bin Rashid AlZayani, Minister of Industry, Commerce and Tourism to discuss the most efficacious and result oriented courses of action and strategies to aggrandize and expand the economic, commercial, touristic and trade relations between the two countries as well as creation of employment for Sri Lankan nationals in Bahrain.
Both the Minster and Ambassador were convinced of the utility and of the potentiality to enhance and to augment the commercial and economic relations with greater and more result-oriented cooperation, collaboration, engagement, facilitation and partnership, which would benefit both the countries. Sri Lankan Produce & Food Martscheduled to be held on November 28 in close coordination with, Lulus Hypermarket, one of the largest retail supermarkets in the entire region of Middle East, South Asia and South East Asia.
This is an initiative of the Economic Diplomacy Program of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Sri Lanka to promote exports, investments, FDI, employment and tourism, among others.
The two paramount objectives of this event are to enhance and boost exports from Sri Lanka to Bahrain and tourism from Bahrain to Sri Lanka as well as to showcase, project and profile the image of the country, amongst others.
Ambassador said that a number of Sri Lankan goods, produce and products would be on display as well as on sale at the Lulus Hypermarket. Ambassador Mendis emphasized the fact that the current Government is tenaciously and aggressively focuses on enhancement and expansion of Economic and Commercial Diplomacy.
During the meeting with the Minister, Ambassador accentuated the fact that the Government of Bahrain has extended a highly favorable environment and milieu for Sri Lankans to live and to work, peacefully and comfortably, in the Kingdom of Bahrain, thus mutually benefiting both the countries.
The Minister and the Ambassador were of firm conviction that gainful employment opportunities in the categories of semi-skilled, skilled and highly-skilled for Sri Lankan nationals in Bahrain would intrinsically and inherently benefit both the countries.
Ambassador said that the remittances from the migrant and expatriate Sri Lankans who are employed outside of Sri Lanka are a significant and momentous source of income/foreign exchange for the country.
He also added that the financial contribution of the migrant and expatriate Sri Lankans is nearly 9% of the GDP of the country which is almost equivalent to the total remittances and earnings of garments, tourism, tea and gems and jewelry respectively.

Alex Paranthaman in transcreation
Alex Paranthaman is a talented writer not widely known by academic critics His mtier is poetry. From Mannar, Kaiveli, Chettikulam, Matalan and finally in Mullivaikkal (all in the Northern Province) he has seen and undergone severe calamity in the name of protected war.
Jeevanathi Publishers have published a 70-page book of his poems. Instead of my reviewing the book I prefer to transcreate some of his poems into English so that the non-Tamil readers could understand how a section of the humanity suffered in a prolonged war for nearly 30 years. His title of the book is befittingly called Deadly Pains (Marana Valikal). There are a large number of poems, short and long in this collection priced at Rs.300.
Lets go into some of his poems as read in English:
Born as a Tamil, spoke in Tamil, laboured for Tamil, at last, the State gave me a gift to walk steadily
Two walking sticks. *
One is holding an umbrella to a governing party, and the one who voted for him is also holding an umbrella inside his leaking house*
Tamil corpses breathed out their last address- Mullivaaikaal*
Wealthy comfort policies changed places during one night
The Vanni warzone smiled silently within itself finding the smallness of the turncoat chairs when tens of thousands were uttered. *
Blow him to kill is the pastime slogan in the country, True. Whats its matter living or dead
So long as accused as Drohi hunting you, understand the death pit is not far from here*
Those escaping death are dying again psychologically affected. Apart from the heaviness of the losses, pain envelops further due to their helplessness. Cheaters are climbing up stepping on those dying escaping deaths and continuing their journey-these watchers. *
Caught in the shelling, losing parts of our bodies, unable to carry them, crossing the small canals we reach Chettikulam. And yet until now, it is not a fertile soil. *
I find it difficult to read more poems in this collection because reading his poems I am weeping and visualizing the agony of many generations of the Tamil community have undergone during the gruesome war and more importantly after the war. The people there are like walking shadows losing everything they had.
Sitting in Colombo, I never knew the horror they have experienced for more than five decades.
I wish that I trans create all his poems, particularly his longer poems, but I cannot do that because I am weeping most of the time reading his poems unable to find the appropriate words to use.
Alex Paranthamans poems are not merely a realistic account of what he had suffered or observed but the collection also reveals how an artist in him endures the present hoping some salvation could be provided by the state to all those innocent people affected. What they need is kindness, empathy, love and proper channelling of funds for their reasonable urgent needs by all of us.
The priority of the State is to attend to all the people who have lost everything in all parts of the country to live as decent citizens of the country.

All in a days work: The Presidents taming of an ex-PM
Speaker Karu Jayasuriyas bull in the China-shop approach to interpreting parliamentary procedure was sagging so much at the seams, that it required family  his son-in-law Navin Dissanayake  to park himself by his side, when Jayasuriya completely lost the plot in parliament the other day.
Good Speakers dont lose control under any circumstances, in the way that Speaker Karu did. But he lost it, and the sort of spectacle that unfolded would be remembered for a long time to come in the annals of parliamentary democracy in this country, particularly when history is written against the backdrop of the staggering transitions of 2018.
It required presidential intervention in the end, to unravel the mess that Karu Jayasuriya created. The President, a former Leader of the House, has a keen sense of the possible and the impossible within the parliamentary tradition.
On the other hand, it seems ex Premier and leader of the UNP, Ranil Wickremesinghe knows Erskine May, but unfortunately does not fathom that the same Erskine May who is considered to have written the most authoritative and influential work on parliamentary procedure, lay a premium on the proceedings in the House, in deciding the proper contours of power within parliament.
At the party leaders meeting on Sunday, the President trumped the Royal College and Law school educated politician who thinks he knows Erskine May, (probably because he has many friends in the British Conservative establishment)
When Wickremesinghe said that the UNP has passed a no confidence motion against the Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, the President retorted that Wickremesinghe should produce the Hansard that testified to that effect, Ranil Wickremesinghe hemmed and hawed. There was no such Hansard, and no amount of Erskine May could help fill that yawning void. Whereupon, the President himself was able to provide the Hansard, which had no record whatsoever in any form, of any passage of a no-confidence vote on the prime minister.
RW GAVE UP
That exchange between the President and Wickremesinghe ended the grandstanding by the UNP. If the Hansard had no record of Wickremesinghes position that the Prime Minister had no support in the House, no amount of knowledge of the Westminster traditions of paramilitary democracy could save the UNP leader from having to face the nation as the chief cause of the instability and the bad press that resulted from the farcical parliamentary proceedings, over which Karu Jayasuriya presided over last week.
In the end, the President forced Wickremesinghe to square with reality, wind down the tempo of his protest, and agree to compromise.
In the entire contretemps, there is an inward lesson that is a metaphor of sorts, for how the country is faring.
The UNP has been out of control, and in turbulent political weather from the early stages of the administration, set up in January of 2015.
May be thats not unusual for any political party that has been out of power for a while, and the UNP had not been in power for at least ten years before the 2015 election.
But, turbulence is not faced by throwing a fit inside the cockpit, and ignoring the flight crew, including the co-pilot and the flight engineer.
But this was Ranil Wickremesinghes reaction to turbulence. He took total control of the craft, and flew the plane with the help at best, of a few air hostesses, in a manner of speaking.
In the end the aircraft was so close to a spectacular crash, and it required the steadying hand of the president to save the vessel.
A BLUFF CALLED
This week, on Monday, with the Deputy Speaker in the Chair, the people saw parliamentary proceedings get back on an even keel, and the nation poised to get back on track.
Behind the Presidents reference to the Hansard, is the exposure of the Speakers and Ranil Wickremesinghes wooly headed, mishmash of a plan to unseat Mahinda Rajapaksa as prime minister.
Earlier in the week, the last struts holding plan gave way. All of the UNP MPs along with the sidekicks in the JVP agreed that the first Clause to the no confidence motion that they had brought against Mr. Mahinda Rajapaksa is invalid, and that they are agreeable to getting that Clause removed.
In that five minutes of Hansard recorded parliamentary proceedings, the UNP had admitted that Mahinda Rajapaksa is indeed the prime minister, no questions asked.
There is clarity now, that the UNP was bluffing. It was known to one and all involved in the siege of Temple Trees that the new Prime Minister was legally and constitutionally appointed. Despite this the UNP was willing to pursue a slash and burn policy in parliament, and lay siege to the Prime Ministers chair as well.
All of the above indicates the gulf between those versed in Erskine May, and those who know parliamentary practice and statecraft by process of application. The President is of the latter category.
It was a similar outcome, when running the country. The Wickremesinghe UNP thought it had the expertise at its disposal to rev up and grow the economy.
Malik Samarawickrama was thought to bring in the businessmens acumen, and the foreign friends in the form of the lending agencies etc., were thought of as the virtual-drivers behind the Yahapalana economic juggernaut.
The whole thing fell into pieces, because there was nothing there.
Its a pity that the President was deprived of the command position to bring the ship on an even keel at the time the Yahapalana economic plans were unraveling.
The point is that the president offered Wickremesinghe the courtesy of non interference. He stepped back, and didnt quote market figures in opposition to Wickremesinghes citing of his neo liberal bullet points, the way he cited Hansard against the latters Erskine May this week.
THE VESSEL TANKED
What was clear from the way Ranil Wickremesinghe faced the All Party meeting with the president a few days back was his diffidence.
If he was a man in command of the situation, he would not have slinked in and stated sotto-voce that the president should accept what he claimed were the multiple no confidence motions that have been passed against PM Mahinda Rajapaksa.
On the 26th of last month, he had ceded command completely to the president. This was after nearly four years of having assumed that he had supreme untrammeled command, because he thought that he had outmanoeuvred the president within the Yahapalana regime.
The point is that Ranil Wickremesinghe in fact thought the president was irrelevant. He thought the Presidents work was over, the day he was brought to power, and had him (RW) installed as Prime Minister.
In the end, closure to that tale came when the President, never mind Erskine May, had to teach Wickremesinghe this week that parliament cannot have an independent record, detached and separate from Hansard proceedings. If it was not in the Hansard, it did not happen, and that was as clear as Erskine May.
In retrospect, it appears that despite the bluster, all political parties protesting from TNA to UNP want the Presidents guidance.
One reason for this is, having together steered the ship so close to the iceberg, they are now in a funk that the possible unmooring of the entire governing apparatus would be blamed on them, and rightly so.
So, it seems, they want to pull back from the brink, and to do that they have to pretend to attack the president, while hoping that he would somehow find a way to extricate them from the mess they have got themselves into.
There was no brinkmanship at all in Ranil Wickremesinghes sauntering into the All Party meeting with the President. This was apparent from the fact that he had no brief.
He had not come there to negotiate. He merely sought a way out. Thats why he sat there and meekly suggested that the so called no confidence motion that had been passed against Premier Rajapaksa be honoured.
In and of itself this was a ridiculous position to take. If a no confidence vote of that nature had been passed in reality, it would have been self evident, and there could have been no cause to go on pleading this fact with the president.
So, in essence, Wickremesinghes face to face meeting with the two other chief protagonists in the drama, the president and the prime minister, was a capitulation.
Yet, even though a capitulation it was, he had not thought of a modus operandi for how to lose the game.
It was basically a case of making some meek utterances at the meeting, so that the president could put him out of his misery.
Fortunately, the President was up to the task, and he was able to tell the former prime minister to go to hell in a manner that the latter may even look forward to the trip.
A simple tweet was sufficient to drive the point home that the Wickremesinghe resistance was more showboating than anything else.
I thank all the Party Leaders and Parliamentarians for adopting a peaceful and consensual course of action at the Parliament today, following my meeting with the Party Leaders last evening.
That was the Presidents tweet.
It brought clarity to a situation that developed so fast, that Wickremesinghe was struggling to understand it.
THE END GAME
His resistance was now confined to the precincts of Temple Trees, that he had laid siege to, in order to compensate for the fact that all his other efforts to lay siege had failed.
He wanted to lay siege to Parliament. But parliament adjourned with an agreement to appoint committees to go ahead with the impending business.
He wanted to lay siege to Colombo. He succeeded instead in getting a few joggers to mount the soap-boxes at Independence Square. He wanted to lay siege to key installations and offices, but could not get within a yard of any of them. So he remains holed up at Temple Trees, by the good graces of his indulging opponents.
In all of this, the curious fact is that despite the outward stance of protest, the UNP has quite readily acknowledged that Mahinda Rajapaksa is Premier, and that there is nothing they could do about it.
Parliamentary house-keeping arrangements have meanwhile confirmed this fact to the whole country which has seen, on public television, the UNP occupying the opposition benches.
It does mean that the protests are to keep up appearances, and the knee jerk, crestfallen showing by Wickremesinghe at the All Party meeting with the President, was if any was needed, confirmation of this reality.
There can be no real protests anyway when there is an ambiguity in the position that is taken.
Either Wickremesinghe thinks that former President Rajapaksa is Premier, or he totally rejects the fact. But, he has been so undecided in this regard, that he thought nothing of removing the Clause 1 of the so called No Confidence Motion, while getting the UNP to agree in parliament no less, that Mahinda Rajapaksa is indeed the prime minister.
Its now accepted as of record in Hansard. The Prime Minister is Mr. Rajapaksa.
The president has got the former prime minister to accept for the parliamentary record, that Mahinda Rajapaksa is the duly appointed premier of the country.
As it ought to be said, End of Story.

Bangladeshi Businesses keen  to see futuristic economic policies
Industrialists and economists urged major political parties to come up with strong political agenda to turn the local economy into a regional business hub, with pledges to address institutional weakness of key monetary institutions, pervasive corruption and deliver a long-term investment policy in their election manifestos.
While the main political parties are in the process of drafting manifestos in the run up to the December 30 national elections, the chamber leaders urged to prioritise economic policies over political issues to steer the economy to double-digit growth trajectory.
The economy needs massive investment to take the country to a middle income nation. To allure the local and foreign investment, the next government must have a vision to improve the ease of doing business index with holistic reforms in bad regulations, FBCCI president Shafiul Islam Mohiuddin told the Dhaka Tribune.
The enhanced investment will turn our local economy into an attraction for regional business, which eventually creates jobs opportunity for millions of unemployed youth.
Another chamber leader said as the incumbent government opened the Chittagong sea port for Indian business people, the opportunity should equally apply to other South Asian economies. If election manifestos focus on the transborder business model, foreign investors would be lured to invest in Bangladesh to grab huge local and mammoth Indian consumer market.
You need a policy for an economic transformation; you need a vision to go beyond the territory to improve the lots of your voters, and draw a optimistic future for the youth, the chamber leader said.
He said like the recent corporate tax cut in the USA was announced in the election manifesto of the Republican Party, Bangladesh political parties also should focus on lowering corporation tax to expand business and open door for huge job creation.
Crucial economic agendas and taxation policies should get a room in the election manifestos of main political parties.
Ahead of 11th parliamentary election, the Dhaka Tribune talked to the countrys leading business people and economists about what they want to see in the election manifestos of major political parties.
Meanwhile, the economists stressed on more investment on human resource development to meet the demand of skilled and technical experts, the need for the industry to escalate the value addition in manufacturing sector.
They also wanted to have political commitment on carrying reforms to ease the rules and regulations centring business and investment.
In addition, both economists and business leaders called for continuation of current infrastructure development projects and enhance policy supports to become a developed country.
As per the latest data of the World Bank (WB), in the index of ease of doing business Bangladesh ranked 176th out of 190 countries, the lowest among South Asian nations.

## Title: Bhagavatha Mela, an ancient Tamil dance drama
## Supertitle:

Bhagavatha Mela, an ancient Tamil dance drama
Among the many classical dance forms of India, Bhagavatha Mela is one of the classical dances of Tamil Nadu. Essentially it is a dance drama. Bharatha Natyam is a pure classical dance which is evolved from Sathir whilst Bhagavatha Mela is a dance drama, which originated in the 11th century A.D. Thirthana Narayana Yogi is the author of the famed Krishna Leela Tharangani who migrated from Andhra and settled in Tamil Nadu.
He dedicated himself to the development of Bhagavatha Mela in Tamil Nadu. He and his followers believed that the worship of God was only possible when it is expressed through music, dance and drama. Mainly it followed the Vaishnava tradition.
Enacted in villages
Venkataraman Sasthiriyar who lived in Mellatur wrote many dance dramas, among them, were Prakalathan, Rukmani Kalyanam, Savithiri Vaypavam which were some of the popular dance dramas enacted in villages around the Thanjavur district of Tamil Nadu.
Thanjavur is the home of fine arts. Just as Bharatha Natyam, developed styles from different gurus so too the Bhagavatha Mela developed different styles.
Mellatur which is closely linked to the origin and development of Bhagavatha Mela was a beautiful village, on the banks of the tributary of the Cavery River. It was a gift by a Nayaka king Achuthappa to 510 Brahmin families. In ancient times at the Varatharajah Perumal Kovil in Mellatur, many dance dramas were performed during the Narashima Jayanthi festival. Like Bharatha Natyam, Bhagavatha Mela was a deeply devotional art and it was enacted in Temples.
Vazhuvoor style
The Bhagavatha Mela starts with a prayer song Thodaya Mangalam which is also followed in the Vazhuvoor style of Bharatha Natyam.
But today other styles of Bharatha Natyam also use the Thodayamangalam not as a prayer song as in the Vazhuvoor tradition but as a dance form. Like Bharatha Natyam, Bhagavatha Mela uses hand gestures, abhinaya, and facial expressions to interpret the meaning of the song with rhythm (Thala). Bhagavatha Mela like Bharatha Natyam has pure Nirtha movements for the sequence of Swaras and Sollukadu Nattuvangam. But in Bharatha Natyam, the Sollukattu Nattuvangam is not coordinated to the music, but it is coordinated to the relevant rhythm thalam.
Whilst in Bharatha Natyam Sollukattu Nattuvangam is coordinated to the music and thala together.
In the dance drama Bhagavatha Mela the characters sing and speak but it is not done in today's Bharatha Natyam.
Carnatic music
These art forms are based on Carnatic music. Bhagavatha Mela only uses Telugu based Carnatic music. But Bharatha Natyam uses Tamil and Telugu based Carnatic music. In Bharatha Natyam female dancers play the major role, whilst in Bhagavatha Mela even the Female roles are played by males.
Bhagavatha Mela has closely connected to Kuchipudi a classical dance form of Andhra Pradesh. Like Kuchipudi, conversation in between the music and the dances take place. Earlier Tamil and Telugu were the main languages of Madras Presidency. But after the separation of Andhra from Madras presidency the use of Telugu declined in Tamil areas.

The Interact Club of Colombo School of Arts and Sciences together with the publication division of the Marga Institute is conducting a creative writing workshop to promote good citizenship and values among school children. The programme initiated by the Marga Institute is designed to bring together talented young writers among school children who would work together to publish a Children's novel on good mindfulness, citizenship, and good values.
The children's storybook which is scheduled to be published in March 2019 will comprise the short stories that will be selected at the CSA/ Marga Workshop.
Gratiaen Award Winner Lal Medawattegedara, Lecturer, Open University of Sri Lanka, will conduct the creative writing workshop.
The first pilot workshop organized by the Marga Institute together with the Colombo School of Arts and Sciences will take place on November 24 and 25 at the Colombo School of Arts and Sciences at Mahawela Place Colombo 6. The programme will consist of exciting group activities, discussions on literature and values, and a session on creative writing.
Considering the outcome of the workshop, a Spokesmen of Marga Institute stated that the idea is to encourage young students to express their views about the world that they wish to live in and help them to create stories that will promote values.
Last year we got the approval from the Ministry of Education to carry out an island-wide programme to promote values among public schools, and initially a couple of private sector organizations showed interest in sponsoring it. Unfortunately, it did not materialize and thereafter we considered proceeding with it as a pilot programme with our funds and approached the Interact Club of Colombo School of Art and Sciences. We are happy to see the interest of these children as they take the initiative to reach out to other schools in Colombo through the Interact Network and bring together a small group of young creative writers Spokesmen for Marga Institute stated.

Deadly hospital shooting rocks Chicago
US: An argument in a hospital parking lot escalated into a shooting that killed three people, including a police officer, in the US city of Chicago on Monday.
The violence only ended when police engaged in a shootout with the gunman inside Mercy Hospital.
We have four deceased individuals: police officer, two female staff employees at the hospital, and the offender, police Superintendent Eddie Johnson told journalists.
The shooter killed the first victim --a woman who was in a domestic relationship with him -- during an argument in the parking lot, then fired at police when they got to the hospital, and ran inside, Johnson said.
Additional police -- including SWAT officers -- arrived at the scene, and engaged the offender for several minutes in the hospital, with gunshots being fired by the offender and by the police, he said.
During the shootout, the gunman killed a second woman when she got off an elevator, Johnson said. The shooter also fatally wounded, but it was unclear if he killed himself or was killed by police.
Mayor Rahm Emanuel identified the two female victims as a doctor and a pharmaceutical assistant. Patients described being alarmed by the sound of gunshots outside Mercy Hospital and seeing a man apparently walking with a woman in the parking lot before shooting her three times in the chest.
Once she fell to the ground, he stood over her and shot her three more times, bystander James Gray told reporters, adding that the attack played out like a movie scene. TV footage showed terrified patients and staff filing out of the hospital into a parking lot with their hands in the air after officers flooded the area.
Patient Hector Avitia told the local CBS television affiliate he was with his wife waiting for test results when he saw a gunman dressed in black fire on someone on the ground several times in the parking lot.
Then almost immediately, an officer was already coming in an SUV, and (the assailant) exchanged fire at them and then reloaded and shot the person on the ground again, another witness said.
And then he made his way into the hospital and more shots were fired. The shooting followed a series of recent high-profile gun rampages that have fueled calls for reform of firearms regulations in a country plagued by gun violence.
Less than two weeks earlier, a gunman killed 12 people in a California music bar packed with college students.
That came after the worst anti-Semitic attack in modern US history, when a gunman opened fire on congregants at a synagogue in the US city of Pittsburgh on October 27. - AFP

Dont be fooled by rumours Australian HC
Australia remains committed to protecting its borders, stamping out people smuggling, and preventing people from risking their lives at sea.
The Australian High Commission is aware of rumours circulating on social media in Sri Lanka that it is possible to get to Australia illegally by boat.
Australian High Commissioner to Sri Lanka Bryce Hutchesson warns Sri Lankans not to be fooled by false advertising through social media or by people smugglers.
Australias borders are closed to illegal migration. The tough border protection policies that have secured Australias borders against the threat of people smuggling and prevented people from dying at sea remain in place.
Australia maintains a robust operational capability to detect and respond to any people smuggling boat to ensure that no illegal maritime venture makes it to Australia. If you attempt to come illegally by boat, you will be caught.
Every Sri Lankan people smuggling boat that has entered Australian waters in the past four years has been stopped, and all those on board returned to Sri Lanka, High Commissioner Hutchesson said.
Australia continues to work closely with regional partners, including Sri Lanka, to identify and disrupt people smuggling ventures before they even get on the water.
In the past five years, international authorities, with the assistance of Australia, have disrupted 78 people smuggling ventures, preventing 2525 people from travelling illegally by boat and leading to more than 614 arrests.
By working together with our regional partners, we are shutting down people smuggling syndicates operating in our region and preventing people from getting on dangerous and pointless boat ventures, High Commissioner Hutchesson said.
Since the implementation of Australias toughest ever border protection measures in 2013, Australia has returned 827 people from 34 people smuggling ventures to their country of origin or departure, including 166 Sri Lankans.

## Title: Financing Economic Growth: Macroeconomic Perspective
## Supertitle: 
## Section: Features

Financing Economic Growth: Macroeconomic Perspective
The centre-point in macroeconomic analysis of countries is the growth of real national income or economic growth. Its second layer contains consumption, savings and investments. While they are the means how the national income is utilized, they are also the sources or forces that promote further growth of income. The rest of analysis covers how various market factors and external shocks including state policies affect consumption, savings and investments that result in overall movements of the economy.
In some periods, economies grow faster while some other periods are economic recessions. In general, economies undergo cycles of growth or business cycles which are connected to imbalances among consumption, savings and investments. Therefore, economic stability is considered as the core of economic management as economic volatilities or significant business cycles are not considered healthy for the public.
Economic growth
Economic growth is an estimate for the growth of the total production volume of all goods and services during a particular period, e.g., quarter or year. Economists and statisticians have developed techniques to measure the production covering various sectors such as agriculture, mining, manufacturing, trade and services. The growth of production depends on mobilization and utilization of resources such as labour, land and capital and the level of productivity. The improved productivity allows more production out of same quantity of resources.
Therefore, economic analysists look at both mobilization of resources and improvement in productivity underlying the economic growth. In general, higher economic growth reflects more opportunities for employment and income. Higher production also has favourable impact on prices or inflation in the economy. Therefore, countries seek higher economic growth to improve living standards of the public. However, whether the increase in income and employment from economic growth helps to reduce income disparities of people/households is a different line of analysis.
Consumption
Consumption is the use of income for regular spending for living such as food, clothing, rent, transport, education and health. It counts the major part of demand for goods and services produced. To keep production and economic growth, the momentum of consumption is necessary. For example, if consumption tends to fall due to whatever reasons, producers will confront a rise in their inventories/stocks that will result in cut-down of hiring labour and production in the next production cycle. Consumption depends not only on current level of income but also on expected income. Therefore, credit is extensively used to finance current consumption. For example, credit cards system facilitates current consumption based on expected future income. Bank term-credit schemes also help current consumption on high value consumer durables based future income streams of borrowers.
Consumption is categorized into government and private. Government consumption is mainly purchase of goods and services for provision of public services such as civil administration and law and order which are essential for smooth functioning of the economy and its growth. The government consumption or recurrent expenditure is about 75% of government expenditure in the national budget and about 12% of total consumption in the country.
Unlike in old economic analyses of developing countries, consumption is given a positive attitude on the economic growth process in modern economies, especially in advanced market economies. During the past decade, monetary and fiscal policymakers have been facilitating considerable increases in consumption to recover from the economic and financial downturn in the US and Europe. Japan has been in struggle during the last two decades to boost consumption to recover from the recessionary economy.
Savings
Saving is the part of income that is not consumed. In case of a person, saving may be held at hand or in financial investments at banks or capital market. In turn, such financial investment may be used by the borrowers for their consumption. However, the term savings, i.e., domestic or national savings, in macroeconomy is the amount of savings utilized for investments. In that sense, savings of persons whether used for consumption or investment is good for the economy. The development of financial markets and institutions promotes savings habits and enable fast and effective mobilization and utilization of savings for economic activities where savings in currency at hand reduces. Savings depends on income levels, expenditure levels and interest rates. As higher interest rates reflect the increase in opportunity cost of holding money, people tend to save more during high interest rates. In general, countries that run on large national budget deficits, government savings is negative due to consumption higher than the revenue. Therefore, private savings is required to finance both budget deficit and investments.
Investments
Investments are the spending undertaken to enhance the capacity or scale of production or capital stock. Buildings, machinery, new technology, infrastructure, research and development and commencement of new businesses fall under investment. Skill development is also a part of investment as it enhances the productivity. Spending involved in on-going production cycle is not investment as such spending is the working capital funded by cash inflows on existing production. All economies require investments to maintain and promote economic growth for better living standards for the people. A significant part of investments in countries is the government investments that primarily fund infrastructure development such as reservoirs, roads and ports that enhance the overall production capacity of the country. The government investment was 13% of total investments in 2017.
Financing of Savings-Investments Gap
Investments are financed by savings. As the majority of savers are not producers who seek to invest, a market is necessary to channel savings to investors. Some business firms may use own savings as part of investments. Banks, financial institutions and financial markets have engineered a large number of products to mobilize savings to finance both consumption and investments with varying risks and businesses among the borrowers/investors. Venture capital is the risky financial product invented to promote start-ups that have revolutionized the global economy. Liberalization of exchange controls since 1980s has led to a global financial market to trade savings cross-border.
In monetary economies, the gap between savings and investment creates significant economic instabilities. Any savings not consumed or invested causes the spending of the economy to fall short of the production and inventories/unsold production to rise above the normal level. This leads to producers to cut-down production and employment in the next production cycle as existing inventories can be utilized to supply. Similarly, increase in investments and production funded by borrowing from abroad will also increase inventories unless consumption/demand rises. Therefore, macroeconomic theory presents a view of economic stability when savings and investments are maintained at balance. Accordingly, business cycles are caused by misbehaviours of savings and investments.
In the past, economies were closed for foreign trade (goods, services and capital). Therefore, country investments were limited by its domestic savings. In low developed countries, savings was low due to low income and, in turn, income was low due to low investments. Therefore, a vicious circle of poverty based on low income, low savings, low investments and low income was a core idea in development economics. Therefore, it was suggested to increase investments to break the circle. As domestic savings was already low, governments resorted to project loans and aid from foreign governments to increase investments. Tight exchange controls prevented the private sector from mobilizing foreign capital/savings. The unitization of foreign savings is highly valid for all countries even today. See Table
Investments in Globalized Economies
Countries operating in the present globalized economy can have access to increase foreign savings for domestic investments. The development of financial markets has opened up trade of global savings for investments in forms of credit and direct investments by foreign investors across the world. New global supply chain where countries produce for foreign trade/markets has made investments effective and productive. In this environment, governments are only expected to maintain policy stance friendly for business and investments to facilitate local and foreign investors to carry out investments, production and trade on the basis of comparative advantages/productivity that vary across countries.
As a result, governments have privatized their business monopolies and now provide various fiscal/tax incentives to foreign investors to do businesses. Opening of foreign investment/business zones with necessary infrastructure largely free from local regulations has been a common policy strategy followed in many countries. Outsourcing of production processes across the countries facilitates countries to produce parts without large factories whereas only assembling factories are required in few locations. Outsourcing of global IT industry has spread to corner households and individuals who have the skills and has created wide opportunities for employment and income across the world.
Various information services such as publication of Ease of Doing Business Ranking, Corruption Perception Index, Business Sentiments Index and various other indices and academic research on trade and investments have facilitated governments to improve the policy framework and investors to select better locations of businesses.
In this environment, a large number of countries and population have come out of poverty during the last three decades. The emergence of East Asia and China in the global economy is the classic eye-witness.
In new macroeconomics, countries can invest and grow beyond the domestic base of savings and resources if they are competitive to attract foreign savings and investments. In globalized economies, the current account deficit or surplus (balance in goods, service, factor income and remittances) in the international balance of payments (BOP) is the estimate for the gap between domestic savings and investment. The deficit is the net inflow of foreign savings/investments to finance the domestic production. The surplus is the outflow of domestic savings/investments to finance the production of other countries. The countries that have competitive advantages in financial trade can emerge as global financial centres to attract large scale of foreign savings and re-channel it to other countries while generating income and employment in the country.
Macroeconomic Policy Challenge
The BOP current account deficit is not necessarily an unfavourable sign of the economy in the growing cycle. What is necessary is to keep the deficit favourable and sustainable for the countrys growth and attraction of productive foreign investments such as direct investments that take business risks without creating debt to the economy.
Sri Lankas deficit was around 6% to 16% of GDP in early 1980s immediately after liberalization of the economy in 1977. Investment projects so financed are the backbone of the present domestic production and exports.
In contrast, if the deficit is due to heavy imports of consumption goods and services funded by foreign borrowing which is also a source of foreign savings, the country will end up in catastrophe in default of foreign debt whether the debtor is the government or the private sector. Although the recent deficit has been low around 2% to 3% of the GDP, it is the non-project imports that have caused a rising debt stock without favourable economic growth.
The BOP current account surplus which invests resources generated through trade of domestic resources abroad is also not a favourable macroeconomic achievement as such savings/resources are trapped in foreign countries with various risks including default. They also find difficult to repatriate such savings due to excessive domestic monetary expansion and liquidity that would be created by those proceeds. For example, Chinas foreign reserve of around US$3.4 trillion invested world over including the US has become a geopolitical problem to China itself. It can no way use these resources within China.
Therefore, management of savings, investments and BOP is the fundamental in macroeconomic management of any country. It is in this context that the importance of economic and financial stability is presented. Therefore, macroeconomic managers of the countries, both public and private, have to innovate and manage their credit delivery systems to cover both domestic and foreign savings and investments to have a favourable mix of consumption and investment activities to ensure the wider stability of respective economies.
The geopolitical stability, investor/business friendliness of public policies/regulations and policy consistency are essential preconditions for macroeconomic management and stability in a global trade and investment environment. In review of developments in the past four decades and prevailing outlook in Sri Lanka, nobody can think of such preconditions to be prevailed in the next decade. Concepts of democracy presented by all those who seek or struggle to take-over the governance of the country in next decade do not offer a publicly accountable framework for financing the economic growth to guarantee the economic well-being that the majority public desperately needs. Therefore, this is the opportune time for them to present a macroeconomic policy management framework with deliverables and targets within their meaning of democracy for the votes of the public.
This gives the opportunity for them to be publicly assessed during their tenure of public governance.

Harry Potter themed wedding
A pair of Harry Potter fans decided to use their love of magic to inspire their wedding day. Niamah Haddow and Michael Sidwell decided on a Harry Potter themed wedding, which included bridesmaids holding broomsticks instead of bouquets, and the groom wearing a Gryffindor tie.
They even had a real owl, and walked down an aisle made out of pages of their favourite Harry Potter books. Niamah, who is originally from Wales but now lives in Australia, said, The whole day was like stepping into Universal Studios, it was like we were in our own world. Everything was Harry Potter. We had pages of the book down the aisle and signs directing people to places in the Potter world. My ring holder was the half blood prince book on the unbreakable vow page. My bridesmaids had broomsticks as their bouquet and my bouquet was made out the book pages as were the groomsmens flowers in their pockets. Michaels tie was also a Gryffindor bow.
The couple, who met five years ago at Worcester University, even sprinkled magic into their vows and music.
Niamah, 24, said, Our vows were all Harry Potter related as was our music. I had a platform 9 and 3/4 wall and had letters inside. There were signs in the girls and boys bathroom saying troll, Moaning Myrtle and Ministry of Magic this way I had signs everywhere.
The couple paid homage to Hogwarts with floating candles, which fill the Great Hall in the school for wizards.
Niamah added, Each wedding table was a different subject at Hogwarts, I had floating candles, I had a cake which was all Harry Potter and a sweet cart that was Honey Dukes. We even had a real owl.
Police Officer Niamah said she and Michael, 26, had expressed their love of all things Potter the moment they met.
She said, Because of our ages we have always grown up with it. When we first met we expressed our love for it and our first proper date ended up being at the Harry Potter studios in Watford. We got engaged on the bridge of Stratford upon Avon, its a magical place with lots of Harry Potter and witch related things all around.
The couple wed on October 13 at the Bridge Water Mill in Adelaide, which Niamah said reminded them of the Weasley house And their own house is just as Potter friendly. Niamah said: Our whole house is Harry Potter themed. All our pets were named after Harry Potter characters, our dog is called Albus and we had a cat called Dobby. The super fans said their loved ones, who know of their J.K Rowling obsession, were a bit taken aback by their themed day.
Niamah added, We had a moment before everyone walked into the reception room where nobody had seen the decoration. And it was just Michael and I and we practised our first dance, and for that moment it was just taking in the day. I think when everyone saw the decorations they knew it was coming because they know how we are both big fans! But I think we went above and beyond I dont think they ever expected it to be this much!

Head coach confident team will turn the corner
If one is to believe head coach Chandika Hathurusingha the Sri Lanka cricket team should then turn the corner before next years World Cup.
Its only been 10 months since I started. We are trying to get back into winning ways as soon as possible, said Hathurusingha who took upon himself the responsibility for the teams defeats.
I have the biggest responsibility, and we are working on things. If you look at the two Tests v South Africa, we won them really well. If you look at the two Tests in this series (v England), there were opportunities for us to win both. You should remember that on pitches like this, they won the toss twice as well. Theres a disadvantage there. I dont accept that we are that far behind. If we correct mistakes and learn from mistakes, then I think we can win going forward.
When you play on pitches like this, batsmen are sometimes put into trouble - they were both tough pitches. If you bat well thats because youve adapted to the surfaces.
Sri Lanka who were one-time unbeatable against spin find themselves today susceptible to it. Spin was the result of Sri Lankas recent Test series loss to England where they trail 0-2 in the three-match series. It was the first series defeat in Tests since Hathurusingha took over as coach.
Spinners Moeen Ali, Jack Leach and Adil Rashid took 19 of the 20 Lankan wickets to fall in the Pallekele Test to seal the series win for England. Its not that the Lankan spinners Dilruwan Perera, Akila Dananjaya and Malinda Pushpakumara didnt deliver, they also took 19 England wickets in the Test, but the difference was in the batting where England showed they could handle spin on subcontinent pitches better than Sri Lanka.
This is something new and unheard of where the Lankan batting is concerned for in the past our batsmen were adaptable and quite capable of taking on any spinner who visited our shores.
Our failures against spin arent a long-standing thing. When I go to a selection meeting, theres an issue where you have to think about how many spinners are there to fight for one place. We will have to think about that, said Hathurusingha. We felt Rangana Heraths absence in this match. Weve played in these kinds of pitches only in the last two series. If you looked at what it was like before, we played on batting tracks. When we had Murali we knew hed take wickets on anything. When you score on these pitches its hard to compare with what batsmen used to score. If the team total is 250 or 290, a fifty is a good score.
For Hathurusingha to say that the pitches prepared for the last two series were turners and the ones prepared before them ware batting tracks is quite contradictory to what the stand-in Lanka captain Suranga Lakmal had to say at the pre-match press conference.
Weve asked for a pitch that favours the spinners, and I think thats basically what we have got here, said Lakmal. Because the pitch is a turner, what were talking about right now is playing just one seamer. Though we havent chosen the team yet - that decision will come late in the day.
So what have we got here Is the coach trying to cover up for Sri Lankas batting deficiencies against spin by blaming the pitch that was prepared for the Pallekele Test
PAKISTANS CONTINUED WEAKNESS AGAINST LEFT-ARM SPINNERS
So much for Sri Lanka cricket, lets shift our focus to Abu Dhabi where New Zealand pulled off a stunning four-run win over Pakistan in the first Test. Pakistan were on course to win the Test chasing a moderate target of 176 when they were 130-4 at lunch on day four.
But the afternoon provided a sensational turn of events as Pakistans remaining six wickets crumbled for just 41 runs to hand to New Zealand a dramatic win.
Pakistans weakness against left-arm spinners continued to haunt them as they collapsed to Ajaz Patel who was making his Test debut for New Zealand at the age of 30. Patel ended up taking five wickets for 5 for 59 and seven in the match to take the Player of the Match award.
Since 2009 Sri Lankas left-arm spinner Rangana Herath who retired recently was Pakistans nemesis after being flown in from the English leagues as replacement for the injured Muthiah Muralitharan for the first Test at Galle.
It was a similar scenario to the Abu Dhabi Test, Pakistan were chasing 168 for victory and
Were strongly place at the end of the third day at 71-2, but on the fourth morning they collapsed to 117 all out with Herath doing the main damage taking four wickets for 15 runs of 11.3 overs as Sri Lanka were handed an unlikely win by 50 runs. They later went onto clinch the series 2-0.
In 18 Tests Herath took 95 wickets bowling his country to an innumerable number of victories against them and eventually ending up being the first bowler to take 100 wickets against Pakistan in Tests  106 from 21 Tests.

ICC rejects Pakistan compensation claim over India
DUBAI Tuesday: The International Cricket Council on Tuesday dismissed a compensation claim by Pakistan over India's refusal to honour an agreement to play bilateral series.
Following a three-day hearing and having considered detailed oral and written submissions, the Dispute Panel has dismissed the PCB's claim against the BCCI, the ICC said in a statement.
The decision cannot be appealed.
The dispute centred on a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) according to which India and Pakistan had agreed to play six bilateral series between 2015-2023, four of which would be hosted by Pakistan.
The PCB had filed a compensation claim of $70 million. But India refused to play Pakistan citing the Indian government's objections due to strained relations with Pakistan. According to the agreement, the six tours would include up to 14 Tests, 30 one-days and 12 Twenty20 internationals. The MoU was a reward to Pakistan for backing the Big Three plan according to which India, Australia and England had the major share of power and revenues of world cricket.
However, that arrangement fell apart and the BCCI refused to accept the MoU as a legal document, dismissing it as a piece of paper.
India cut off cricket ties with Pakistan after the 2008 terrorist attacks on Mumbai which left more than 160 people killed.
The two sides have not played a full series since Pakistan's tour of India in 2007. Pakistan toured India for a limited-overs series with two Twenty20s and three one-day internationals from December 2012-January 2013 but full ties were not restored.
After negotiations about the proposed tours failed, the PCB filed a notice of dispute with the ICC resolution committee in November last year, claiming the 70 million dollars in compensation.
Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB), which has reportedly spent one million dollars fighting the case, described the decision as disappointing.
Following a lengthy dispute resolution process, the announcement of the decision has come as a disappointment, it said. PCB will determine its future course of action in this regard after detailed deliberations and consultations with its stakeholders.
The Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) welcomed the decision, saying it had always maintained that the MoU was non-binding and that it merely expressed an intention to play.
The BCCI wholeheartedly welcomes the decision of the Dispute Panel. The BCCI will now move the Dispute Panel to recover its legal cost from the PCB, it said in a press release.

## Title: A. M. A. Azeez: Scholar, educationist and patriot

A. M. A. Azeez: Scholar, educationist and patriot
This is the forty-fifth year since Aboobucker Mohamed Abdul Azeez passed away. With his demise, Sri Lanka lost a patriot and the Muslim community a brilliant scholar and an eminent educationist.
Azeez is best remembered for his dedication to the development and prestige of Zahira College, Colombo - the premier educational institution of Sri Lankan Muslims. Between 1948, when he became the principal of Zahira College in 1961, when he left, Zahira, not only produced successive batches of successful young men who entered the University of Ceylon and graduated as doctors, engineers, scientists and civil servants, but also became in Azeezs own words, the radiating centre of Muslim culture, thoughts and activities. In short, those thirteen years mark the golden era of Zahira College.
He was responsible for the administration of Zahira, but to carry out the teaching activity he had a special talent in recruiting the best staff available in the market. In the upper school, which prepared students to enter the university, Azeez by being a member of the University Senate, had the first choice to pick the brightest of graduates passing out each year. On Mondays, when he used to deliver his weekly address to Zahira students, one could see the galaxy of young graduate teachers standing behind him in a semicircle, digesting quietly Azeezs outpouring intellectual gourmet. His forty minutes assembly address on Mondays gave the students a mixed dose of Islamic spiritualism and secular intellectualism. Being an avid reader himself , Azeez was totally dedicated to build the best college library in Colombo at Zahira. This without any doubt, is one of the permanent legacies of Azeezs principalship at Zahira.
In the field of education, the Muslim community was served by four leading personalities whom I would call, the awesome foursome: M. C. Siddi Lebbe (1838-1898), Razik Fareed (1893-1984), Badiuddin Mahmud (1904-1997) and A. M. A. Azeez (1911-1973). Among them, Azeezs contribution was unique in the sense that he focused entirely on producing a class of Muslim thinkers and intellectuals, like himself, who would not only master the English language, but also acquire the voluminous knowledge produced in that medium particularly on Islam and Muslim civilization. He was aware of the flood of path-breaking thoughts and research on Islam that was coming out in Western languages and especially in English.
Azeez was an Iqbalian visionary and an admirer of Muslim leaders and educationists such as Sir Seyed Ahmad Khan, Muhammad Ali Jinnah and Abul Kalam Azad. As such, he realised the crucial role that Zahira College had to play in sowing the seeds to germinate and bring forth a new generation of Muslim luminaries in Sri Lanka, who would lead the community along a modernist path. To him, it was an uphill struggle given the then context of the local Muslim community which was buried in commercial pursuits and rigid religious conservatism that refused to entertain modernist thoughts on Islam and its civilisation. This aspect of Azeezs life is an unwritten chapter in any of his biographies. A critical analysis of his speeches and writings would bear witness to this argument.
With an Honours degree in History from the University of London and as the first local Muslim to successfully complete the Ceylon Civil Service Examination, he started his service to his country as the Assistant Government Agent in Kalmunai in the Eastern Province between 1942 and 1944. The country was afflicted with war time shortages in food at that time. In the agricultural kill of the Karavakupattu Muslims, Azeez found the answer to solve at least part of the food problem. He took the liberty to issue land permits to those Muslims to bring barren crown lands under paddy cultivation. Even today, Muslims of that area fondly remember the services of Azeez and the area known still as Azeez Thurai Kandam, is a
silent testimony to his crucial role in turning that part of the country into the national rice-basket.
During his short spell in Kalmunai, he came into contact with two other personalities of whom, one, Poet Abdul Cader Lebbe, a teacher serving in the same region at that time, became Azeezs lifelong ideological companion, schooled in Iqbals reconstruction of Islamic thought; and the other, Swami Vipulananda, a Hindu devotee and intellectual savant, drew Azeez further into the deep ocean of Tamil language and Literature.
Introduced already from a very young age by his sinna periappa (uncle) Asana Lebbe, and nurtured by the Tamil environment of Vannarpannai, the birth place of that great Tamil scholar Arumuga Navalar, Azeezs thirst for scholarships in Tamil language and literature grew even more voracious. His love and affection to that language and its importance to the Muslim community to promote and protect it, became evident when he argued against the Sinhala Only Bill, in the Senate. In this, he was taking a contrary path to that of other Muslim leaders in Parliament. His approach to the language issue went beyond political populism and into long term analysis of Islams future survival in Sri Lanka. Not many Muslim politicians understood at that time the long term ramifications of the switch from Tamil to Sinhalese as the medium of instruction in Muslim schools. It is no exaggeration to register here that it was the intellectual arguments of Azeez and his lifelong friend Abdul Cader Lebbe, that convinced even Minister Badiuddin Mahmud, who was at that time vehemently supporting that Bill.
Azeezs contribution to Tamil and Tamil Literature deserve separate research. In this respect, A. M. Nahiyas publication, Azeez and Tamil, is a valuable contribution to the memory of this brilliant mind. In the field of literature, Azeez developed a nostalgic love toward Arabic-Tamil, a unique contribution by the Tamil-speaking Muslims to both Tamil and Arabic as well as to Islam. His essay, Arapuththamil Enkal Anpuththamil, yearns for a revival of this somewhat sacred dialect written in a modified Arabic script with a mixture of Tamil and Arabic vocabulary. For some time, he even wondered during the official language controversy, whether Arabic-Tamil should be an option to choose for Sri Lankan Muslims. His friend, Abdul Cader Lebbe convinced him through correspondence that it would be too damaging for Islamic culture in Sri Lanka if Tamil was to be sacrificed in the interest of political expediency.
The Young Mens Muslim Association (YMMA) and the Muslim Scholarship Fund associated with it are the twin products of Azeez and his poet friend. The idea of starting the YMMA and providing financial assistance to the poor, but deserving Muslim students originated during their days in Kalmunai. Hundreds of clever students from different parts of the country benefitted from this fund and became professionals and senior civil servants to serve their country. Surprisingly, the first YMMA branch was initiated in Badulla by his poet friend when he was transferred to the Muslim School, there in 1943. It is an irony that the branch predated the head office in Colombo.
The solitary Palmyrah palm that Azeez planted and nurtured at the entrance of his Meadow Sweet home in Barnes Place, Colombo, constantly reminded visitors of his Jaffna heritage. Hailing from a very prestigious and highly educated family in Jaffna, Azeez was a proud product of Vaidyeshwara Vidyalayam and Jaffna Hindu College. His early education in a Hindu environment enabled him enormously to acquire not only an expertise in Tamil language, but also great familiarity in Hindu philosophy and traditions. This explains why the Jaffna University decided to award Azeez an honorary Doctorate of Letters posthumously at its first convocation in 1980.
Azeez was an institution and a walking encyclopaedia. His thoughts and visions were far ahead of his time. The visionary who introduced Iqbal to Sri Lanka, the educationist who produced a whole generation of English educated Muslim specialists and professionals, the public servant who rendered yeoman service to the struggling Muslim farmers in the east, the author who won recognition in national and international writers forums, and the patriot whose dedication to his country was beyond party politics is no more with us. It is a fitting tribute to this great intellectual and visionary that his name has been included in the 100 Great Muslim Leaders of the 20th Century, published by the Institute of Objective Studies in India. His demise was a great loss to his country, while the intellectual space he has vacated will remain vacant for years to come.
Dr. A.C.L. Ameer Ali hails from Kattankudy and is the son of well known poet Abdul Cader Lebbe. He was a student of Zahira College, Colombo, during the Azeez era, and graduated with Honours in Economics from the University of Ceylon in 1964. He obtained an M.Phil. Degree from London School of Economics and Political Science and a Doctorate from University of Western Australia. He is a trained economist and has taught thousands of students in the University of Ceylon, the University of Brunei Darussalam, the University of Western Australia and Murdoch University. His services were obtained by the South Eastern University, Sri Lanka, as an academic adviser. He is now a senior academic in Murdoch University of Western Australia.
He has published many research articles and presented papers at several international conferences. In Australia, he is a leading personality in the Muslim community holding various positions.
Dr. A. M. A. Azeez Commemoration Meeting and the Memorial Oration will be held on Tuesday, November 27, at 4.30 pm at the Ghaffoor Hall, Zahira College.

Moodys downgrades  Sri Lankas ratings to B2
Moodys Investors Service (Moodys) has downgraded the Sri Lankas foreign currency issuer and senior unsecured ratings to B2 from B1 and changed the outlook to stable from negative.
The decision to downgrade the rating to B2 is driven by Moodys view that ongoing tightening in external and domestic financing conditions and low reserve adequacy, exacerbated most recently by a political crisis which seems likely to have a lasting impact on policy even if ostensibly resolved quickly, have heightened refinancing risks beyond levels anticipated when the rating agency affirmed the rating at B1 with a negative outlook in July.
Moodys projections include a slower pace of fiscal consolidation than assumed in July to reflect disruption to fiscal policy implementation in a period of political turmoil.
The political situation has also resulted in delay to the disbursements planned under the IMF programme.
A prolonged pause in the IMF programme, associated to uncertainty about the direction of policy, would likely undermine investors confidence, exacerbating the tightening in financing conditions.The stable outlook denotes balanced credit risks at the B2 rating level. Moodys expectation is that, despite the current political crisis, any future government will remain broadly focused on implementing important fiscal, monetary and economic reforms that would strengthen the credit profile over the medium term.
However, Moodys assessment is that the governments debt refinancing will remain highly vulnerable to sudden shifts in investor sentiment in a period of further tightening in financing conditions and political and policy uncertainty, with limited buffers to face such risk.
Concurrently, Moodys lowered the local-currency bond and deposit ceilings to Ba2 from Ba1.
The foreign currency bond ceiling was lowered to Ba3 from Ba2 and the foreign currency deposit ceiling was lowered to B3 from B2.

New York celebrates Deepavali
The Permanent Mission of Sri Lanka to the United Nations in New York celebrated Deepavali on Friday, November 9, at the Mission premises.
Many Sri Lankans and Permanent Missions' representatives from India, Singapore and Malaysia attended the event. It commenced with the lighting of the traditional oil lamp.
Religious Affairs Director of the Hindu Temple Society of North America, Swamy Ravi Vaidyanaat, outlined the significance of Deepavali, and conducted a Hindu religious observance.
Deepavali coincides with the new moon in the Hindu lunisolar calendar which is also known as the amasvasya. The five day celebrations begin two days before the amasvasya, and extends for two days. Thus, the festival serves as a moment to rejuvenate the spirit for the year ahead, he explained.
He noted the significance of Deepavali in worshipping the Hindu Goddess Lakshmi and recited Hindu Shlokas about the Goddess and peace, in Sanskrit with English translation.
The festival is celebrated as an important national holiday in Sri Lanka. During this auspicious festival, light serves as a symbol of knowledge, enlightenment, and the dispelling of spiritual darkness. The festival transcends all boundaries of religion, faith, or culture, said Ambassador Dr. Rohan Perera, in his address.
The event concluded with a vegetarian dinner, featuring traditional delicacies.

No-deal Brexit would leave business on brink of chaos
A no-deal Brexit would leave businesses in Northern Ireland on the brink of chaos, according to the director of the Confederation of British Industry (CBI) in Northern Ireland.
Last week, a draft EU-UK deal was revealed, setting out what a future relationship could look like. Chief Economist, Angela McGowan told BBC News NI the CBI was broadly supportive of the deal.
Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley urged the business community to continue speaking out for the deal.
Speaking to CBI members in Belfast, she said the deal assured the economic and constitutional integrity of the UK and said she was disappointed in media coverage of the draft agreement.
McGowan said that while the CBI supported the agreement, there were some aspects it hoped will be ironed out.
Speaking on the BBCs Good Morning Ulster programme, McGowan said the backstop may never have to be used.
Were hoping we dont even need that backstop agreement because what we hope to see this week is the high level principles as to how we will trade in the future, she said.
This opens the path for the UK government to start moving on to that frictionless trade deal that we hope to get with the EU and that the backstop isnt even needed.

McGowan said a no-deal Brexit was not an option for businesses or the health service.
Meanwhile, the head of the Northern Ireland Civil Service reiterated his concerns about the effect of a no-deal Brexit on the regions economy.
David Sterling said the civil service would share the concerns of many across the community in business and elsewhere, that a chaotic or disorderly no deal would be very bad for us locally.In her speech to the CBI, Karen Bradley hit out at disappointing media coverage over the fall-out from the draft agreement.

Oppositions attempts Futile
NO ECONOMIC SANCTIONS,  NO TRAVEL BAN AGAINST SRI LANKA
No discussions were held at international level to impose economic or political sanctions against the Sri Lankan Government nor was there any travel ban imposed on President Maithripala Sirisena, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa or Government Ministers, Diplomatic sources said.
Diplomatic sources disclosed this in response to our inquiries about the false news of the imposition of economic sanctions or a travel ban, spread by the Opposition, taking advantage of the present political impasse in the country over the past few days.
However, the Opposition has continously requested Diplomatic circles to impose economic sanctions that would have an impact on the countrys economy, sources said.
Diplomatic sources held the view that economic and political sanctions or a travel ban may be imposed on countries if sufficient evidence is found against any country in question to have committed crimes which violate the countrys criminal law, or the questionable behaviour of such countries within the ambit of global political arena.
But, in the case of Sri Lanka, there has been no consideration whatsoever to impose economic or political sanctions, embargos or a travel ban, diplomatic sources said.
According to reliable information, the bankrupt Opposition parties have tried their level best to mislead the international community through deception and propaganda campaigns to impose travel bans on the President, Prime Minister and the Ministers and create hardships for the people as a result of the imposition of economic sanctions.But, these bankrupt Opposition gimmicks to bring the country and the people into disrepute have failed miserably, sources said.
If either the Opposition or any other party requests foreign countries or the diplomatic community to impose economic sanctions on our country, it is a disgrace to ones Motherland says, Ven. Dr. Malwane Chandrarathna Thera, the Dean of the Sinhala Faculty of the Kelaniya University.
If anybody has made such a request, that request itself manifests ones own hatred and what the international community should do is to extend help to that country to rise up and move forward,, the Thera said.
We do not think that the International community will interfere into our internal affairs which is a domestic issue. The Government intends to move the country forward, the Dean of the Sinhala Faculty of the Kelaniya University Ven. Dr. Malwane Chandrarathna Thera said.
The Ven.Thera commenting on the move by the Oppositoin to bring the country into disrepute by spreading falsehoods that the international community was planning to impose economic sanctions on Sri Lanka.
We are conscious that certain interested parties are speading falsehoods to say that the country is in a crisis right now. But, the fact is that friendly countries would not do anything that would be detrimental to the well-being of our country, the Thera said. Ven. Dr. Malwane Chandrarathana Thera said that economic sanctions are imposed on countries if those countries are found to have committed grave crimes within their own boundaries and what has happend here is purely conflicting efforts of different political parties. When the State is trying to create a peaceful atmosphere, what the international community should do is to extend its fullest support to this endeavour. Pavidi Handa Organisation Convenor Ven. Muruttetuwe Ananda Thera said the UNP was spreading canards to both the local and the international community using the social media.
He said that the UNP was spreading canards such as possible international sanctions on Sri Lanka in order to mislead both the local and international community. The Thera criticised the conduct of the Speaker and added that his action had contributed to aggravating the political impasse.
He also noted that a General Election was the best option to resolve the present political imbroglio.
Let the people decide who their representatives should be, he added.

Nuwara wewa bund compromised by leak
Residents living near the Nuwara wewa in Anuradhapura said there was a leak in the tanks bund. They added that the bund had been neglected by authorities for several years.
Residents of the Walwatta village said the leakage was increasing by the day, adding that it could pose a threat to people living in the surrounding areas.
The leak had sprung 20 metres from the tanks intake, and nearly 50 litres of water had been wasted per hour so far. The Nuwara wewas capacity is 36,049 acre-feet.
Villagers said that a similar situation had been reported in the Kumbichchankulam tank. Authorities were informed about the matter several years ago, but no action had been taken until the bund was on the brink of collapse. The situation was brought under control by the security forces, they added.
The Nuwara wewa, which was constructed by the King Walagamaba (Wattagamini Abaya), provides drinking water to numerous areas in the Anuradhapura district.
Residents said that no action had been taken so far to resolve the issue although they had brought the matter to the attention of the authorities.

One vision,  many voices
Reading and/or listening to a great profile of a person could lead not only to a momentary bliss but also to a resourceful turning point in ones existence. We are accustomed to reading the noble profiles of saints, heroes and religious dignitaries from various cultures and countries over the years. The compilation of 12 modern Buddhist Masters by Jack Kornfield comes as a rare presentation in this direction.
According to the compiler, the materials in this work have been collected and translated from foreign languages such as Thai over the past years. Furthermore, they represent an intimate record of spoken Dhamma, the teachings of many of the greatest modern Buddhist Master. They are intended to be shared and utilized by all in the development of the wisdom and compassion of the Buddha.
Spiritual teachings
The 12 masters of Buddhist teachings are drawn mainly from the Orient. The countries include Burma and Thailand. But Kornfield does not undermine the other countries like India and Sri Lanka as he has often made journeys in search of the same kind of spiritual teachings. As such, Kornfield states that in making these teachings available, I have tried to secure blessings and assistance from the masters represented. However, due to difficulties of time and half a world of distance, some of these materials have not had the formal acknowledgements and blessings as are traditional in publishing such a volume.
Perhaps the compiler, in keeping the reader as not acquainted with a deeper knowledge in the teachings of the Buddha, has provided a long prologue titling it as Essential Buddhism. That comes as Chapter One. This introduction paves the way to gather the most salient socio-cultural and socio-spiritual essence as taught by the Buddha to his disciples, who in turn transferred the same down the centuries. Thus, the commencement goes as follows: The Buddha after his enlightenment under the Bodhi tree was undecided about the teaching. Who, he wondered, would be able to understand the Dhamma to the depth he had penetrated Who, in fact, would listen With great compassion, the Buddha chose to teach, especially for those beings with but a little dust covering their eyes. Thus Kornfield says that hundreds of thousands of saffron-robed monks and tens of thousands of temples still exist throughout Southeast Asia and Sri Lanka.
In a lighter vein, Kornfield at times lays down tales from his various experiences to edify certain salient points in his presentations. One such tale goes as follows:
A Western monk once asked the permission of his forest teacher to journey to Burma to try the intensive meditation systems of several other well-known teachers. Permission was readily granted. After several years, he returned to his first teacher.
What did you learn The teacher inquired.
Nothing, answered the monk.
Nothing
Nothing that is not already around, that was not right here before I left.
And what have you experienced
Many teachers and many meditation systems. The monk answered. Yet, the more deeply I penetrated the Dhamma the more I realized there was no need to go anywhere else to practice.
Ah yes, replied the teacher, I could have told you that before you left. But you could not have understood.
Meditation of different types
This compilation in Kornfields words is an odyssey. It takes the reader on a journey through the countries one knows but never experienced as a traveller. The reader encounters well the teachers of meditation of different types. They include one great layman, one Bhikkhuni and ten Theravada monk of fame who have developed their teaching methods of meditation and spiritual levels as compared with the mere laymen.
These noble teachers uncover the various aspects of wisdom, power and knowledge, traversing into the inner reading of ones life. The origins of these teachings too became a subject area, linking the east and the west. Each profile that emerges carries an extra value by supplementing it with either a learned article, a talk delivered at a particular place or an interview. For instance, the profile of Mahasi Sayadaw (1904  1987) goes to state how he had a far-reaching effect on the practice of insight meditation in Theravada Buddhist countries. His scholastic studies at a village monastery began at the age of six and culminated several years after his full Bhikkhuni ordination (upasampada) with the highest honour in government-sponsored Pali and scholastic examinations. After teaching the scriptures for many years he set out with the robe and bowl in search of a clear and effective meditation practice. In this manner, the details pertaining to the life and learning process of the noble monk are rewarded. This is followed by a brief note on his teaching linked to the insight meditation, its basic and progressive stages. Similarly, Ajahn Buddhadasa (1906  1993) is visualized as the best known Dhamma Master in Thailand during his lifetime.
Comparative religious studies
In addition to being a great scholar of Buddhist tradition and scriptures, he is learned in many other fields. He is presented as the author of several books in Thai as well as in English on the subject of meditation and comparative religious studies and the application of Dhamma to daily life. One of his learned discourses titled as Insight by the nature method is inserted as additional material. One notable profile is on Ajahn Naib (1897  1983). She was born into the family of Thai governor in a province bordering Burma. At the age of 30, she began the study of Buddhist psychology and insight meditation under Ajahn Pathunta U Vilasa. Twelve years later she began teaching, establishing centres for the study and meditation at many temples, and finally under royal patronage established a Buddhist Research Centre in Bangkok. One of her learned essays titled The Development of Insight is inserted. Jack Kornfields training includes six years in Thailand, India and Burma. Apart from this compilation, he has also compiled several other works inclusive of Buddhas Little Instruction Book (translated into Sinhala by Nayana Rajapaksa).

A peek into Father Mathew
According to Mathew is an upcoming Sri Lankan English film directed by Chandran Rutnam. It is a romance, crime and thriller film based on the crimes of Father Mathew Pieris, Anglican priest of the Church of St Paul the Apostle, Kynsey Road, Colombo 10, who was convicted of the double murders of his wife (Eunice Pieris) and Russel Ingram, the husband of his lover in 1979.
The film stars Jacqueline Fernandez, a former Miss Sri Lanka Universe and Bollywood actress and Alston Koch. Directed by Sri Lankan filmmaker Chandran Rutnam. Chandran Ratnam started his film career in 1956 as a 16-year old lad with the world famous and Oscar-winning Hollywood movie known as The Bridge on the River Kwai. The veteran Sri Lankan film director and a producer who has contributed to movies such as Road From Elephant Pass, Sri Siddhartha Gauthama and The Common Man re-enters the limelight with a movie based on a controversial figure, Father Mathews. Titled According to Mathews, the film is billed to be released soon.
Q: Why have you chosen a historic event occurred in the 1970s
A: I sensed strong emotion and sensation in the story. I felt that this can be a brilliant success only if we launch it as a motion picture. I have utilized the actual facts and the paper cuttings related to the legal documents and the judgment. Before working on the script, I met individuals associated with the priest of the subject. They are still alive and in sound health. I am grateful to them for the exclusive support and assistance given.
Q: You claim to have met Father Mathews in person during his jail term in Welikada Prison. How would you assess that experience
A: It was a random occurrence. I was in the middle of a foreign motion picture. We had to shoot some of the scenes in Welikada Prison. I was busy when somebody suddenly came behind and patted on my shoulder. I turned back to see Father Mathew. He was attired in the prisoners clothing. He had a large Cross and a Bible in his hand. I had known him long before his sentence because I used to frequent his church in Borella as a Catholic. Over our conversation, he suddenly asked me why I would not make a film on his case. I agreed and questioned as to who could play his character. He suggested Gamini Fonseka. He was not pleased with my choice.
Then he said that the role should be played by himself as no other actor could possibly do any justice to his character. He wanted to prove his innocence. I declined that request with a laugh. There is not much of a story plot to make if he is innocent. I said that to his face and earned his ire. His choler was too much that he said he is a scorpion who would bite the enemies acting against him. I got scared at that point and left the place. I knew well that he was an expert in black magic.
This happened 25 years ago. The Court of Appeal issued a verdict to convert his death sentence into a life-imprisonment. Following some time in prison, he got released in 1997. Father Mathews died under strange circumstances following one year of the freedom.
Q: Filmmaker aside, how do you personally view this controversial figure
A: He was a Commander. Father Mathew enjoyed immersive commanding power over so many people in civilian life as well as inmates at the Welikada prison. I took part in several religious functions held in the Catholic Church in Borella in the late 70s. The functions were held under the patronage of Father Mathew.
I had a closer look at his activities. I observed good as well as bad qualities. He was not someone scared of anything or anyone.
If anyone is ever going to make a film on his character, I think I must be in the best position. I personally know him. I remember him sending a child for medical treatments in the USA by his own money. He had such humdinger qualities.
Q: You made reference to the people associated with Father Mathews. He is a revered figure, though later given into many controversies. How did his associates, especially the close relatives, respond to your work

A: While the film was still being shot, his associates continued to come and expose many interesting narratives related to his life. Well, if I really went ahead with those narratives I will certainly end up with an R-rated movie. On the other hand, I had to face influence coming from the Anglican Church and the relatives from the Dalrin Ingram (Father Mathews paramour). I did not get permission to shoot the scenes in certain church premises. We had to create a set and a church in a bare land. I am a Catholic. But I do not regret any wrongdoing.
Q: You are a Catholic. Yet you have made a film on a Catholic Priest with a negative implication. How can you justify your actions
A: Suppose a police officer wants to search your house. But he does not have a warrant. Will you let him in simply because he is donned in a uniform The answer is clear. Likewise, most people hide behind ceremonial robes to execute crimes. It could be anyone, a Buddhist monk, a Catholic priest, or any other religious dignitary. But we cannot accept it when people execute crimes hiding behind authoritative robes.
Q: You have contributed to the cinema in various ways. Where do you place According to Mathews among your other works
A: This is based on a true incident. It happened in the 1970s. So I think this could be my best movie.
I did not make this film particularly to the Sri Lankan audience. I had the western world, especially Hollywood, in my mind. Its a US-collaborated production.
The movie is currently available in English. There will be a Sinhala version soon.
Q: Do you mean to keep your film on par with Hollywood quality
A: Yes. I strongly believe so.

The plight of the Greens under RW
While the theatrics of our honourable people's representatives in Parliament were taking centre stage last week, focusing the unerring attention of the general public, a topic that went underground began resurfacing again amidst the din. Of course we are here referring to the leadership battle in the UNP, or more accurately, the Ranil-Sajith tussle for the number one position in the Grand Old Party. Try as the Greens might to keep matters under wraps no one in the party has been able to quell the dissenting voices from being given full expression. Even at the recent rally organised by the party in the immediate aftermath of the ouster of RW, in Kollupitiya, many UNP local councillors claimed they were attending the rally to make Sajith the party leader and not to support Ranil.
Of course the battle to oust Ranil Wickremesinghe by those voicing the sentiments of the grassroots supporters of the party was not of recent origin. It began when the Greens were suffering serial losses at every election under Ranil's leadership, beginning with the 1994 electoral setback and continued through the 1997, 1999, 2000, 2004, 2005 polls, and all the LG elections, barring the 2002 one when RW was Prime Minister and the incumbency factor stood to his advantage.
Matters came to a head in 2013 when the frustration of the party rank and file was such that Ranil was forced into a leadership contest with Karu Jayasuriya. The vote that was taken at party headquarters Sirikotha was not without drama with stones hurled at the building.
Now it appears the battle to rid Ranil from the leadership and replace him with Sajith has picked up in earnest following the formers ouster from the office of Prime Minister. Significantly, even those who appear to be Ranil loyalists are of the same mindset. Stalwarts such as Ajith P. Perera and Harin Fernando are among this lot, going by their sentiments expressed following the October 26 revolution. The latest to get involved in the 'quit Ranil' project is former Deputy Minister of Transport Asoka Abeysinghe. Speaking at a function in his home base in Kurunegala Abeysinghe said the UNP Central Committee should nominate UNP Deputy Leader Sajith Premadasa unanimously as the UNP candidate for Prime Minister at the general election if the UNP needs to win this time.
He also did not pull any punches when he said; If the UNP presents former Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe this time as its candidate for Premier it will record a sure defeat at the forthcoming general election". He further said he had told the UNP Central Committee members in 2010 that Sajith Premadasa was the most suitable candidate for the Premiership. "We are now ready for the general election after the judgement of the Supreme Court. Ranil Wickremesinghe has been functioning as leader of the UNP for 25 years. The UNP needs a reform and a change in its leadership to win elections. Therefore he should give the leadership to Sajith", he said.
These are no doubt hitherto suppressed sentiments of the UNP village level leaders which are now been expressed openly at a time the party in the throes of a deep crisis. It is as though as there is a clarion call for arms from among the party rank and file. Their feelings are understandable since the Green have been languishing in the political wilderness since 1994, barring a few brief intervals in the sunshine and even then failed to consolidate their power under RW's leadership. The party though had been signally unfortunate to have lost its top rung leaders to the LTTE killer machine leaving it rudderless and at the mercy of mediocrity. Its plight is mostly felt in the rural outback with whose inhabitants the present leadership don't connect. This was well demonstrated at the recent local government election where the party was annihilated.
In fact, the chorus for Ranil to step down gathered momentum after February 10. The results were a clear indication that the UNP had little prospects at future elections if the status quo were to continue. Now things appear to be coming to a head.
Not that the Grand Old Party was devoid of leadership battles before this.
There was the famous Dudley-JR conflict and the short changing of Sir John by D.S. to install son Dudley are Premier. However the party, it must be said, never split whatever the problems and all the warring factions buried the hatchet and took the party to victory. However, under Ranil's leadership, there has been a mass exodus of party stalwarts to the enemy camp and what is more, the trend is not likely to halt if RW continues as the leader, at least that is the majority view. They feel that only Sajith can change the fortunes of the Greens, and, what is more, keep the party intact.

PM Modi eyes top 50 rank  in ease of doing business
New Delhi: Prime Minister Narendra Modi on Monday set an ambitious target of India breaking into top 50 nations in the World Banks Ease of Doing Business ranking and said efforts are on to nearly double the size of countrys economy to USD 5 trillion.
In his opening remarks at a meeting called on ease of doing business ranking with the Indian industry, PM Modi said the era of policy paralysis has ended and his government was giving policy-based governance that has helped catapult the country from 142nd rank among 190 nations on the World Banks ease of doing business ranking in 2014 to 77th position this year.
Reforms will continue and procedures would be further eased to make it easier for companies to do business in the country, he said adding efforts are on to increase the size of the economy to USD 5 trillion.
PM said it is an outcome of Indias consistent reforms trajectory that the countrys position is getting credence globally and is being recognised by international bodies like the IMF, World Economic Forum and UNCTAD.
All these institutions are confident and hopeful of our future due to the pace of our reforms. Amid the persistent efforts in the country, now our effort is to take India to the 5 trillion dollar club as soon as possible. To achieve this goal we will have to improve every sector of the economy, the Prime Minister said.
The Prime Minister recalled that when he had first articulated his vision for India to break into the top 50 in ease of doing business ranking in the years to come, it was greeted with scepticism.
A great improvement is now visible in just four years, Modi said adding that the central and state governments have both worked together towards improving the ease of doing business ranking, in the spirit of cooperative and competitive federalism.
The Prime Minister further said it is necessary to reduce human intervention in processes and increase the use of modern and digital technologies.
Advocating a work culture based on modern technologies, he said it will further promote policy-driven governance.
A Working Group tasked to develop a roadmap towards achieving a five trillion dollar economy by 2025 has prepared its report. The group was constituted by the Department of Industrial Policy and Promotion in the Ministry of Commerce and Industry with participation from government and industry.
India is one of the fastest growing major economies and is currently ranked as the worlds sixth largest economy. Projections of growth, over the medium term, remain encouraging and optimistic for India.
The Prime Minister said all efforts are on to improve Indias ranking in the World Banks Doing Business Report among the top 50 nations.
India was ranked 142nd among 190 nations when the Narendra Modis government took office in 2014.
At that time, the country was battling perceptions of excess red-tape and policy paralysis, Modi said.
Four years of reform pushed up Indias rank to 100th in the World Banks Doing Business 2018 report. It was 130th in 2017 when India was ranked lower than Iran and Uganda.
In its annual Doing Business 2019 report, India secured 77th position. New Zealand tops the list, followed by Singapore, Denmark and Hong Kong. The United States is placed at 8th and China ranked 46th. Neighbouring Pakistan is placed at 136.
India has improved its ranking by 53 positions in the last two years and 65 places in four years since 2014.
The World Bank ranks 190 countries based on 10 parameters, including starting a business, construction permits, getting electricity, getting credit, paying taxes, trade across borders, enforcing contracts, and resolving insolvency.
The Prime Minister further said the government was working on a new industrial policy to blend realities with progress.
A policy which can understand the industry...This policy will be in line with the vision of a new India, he said.
PM Modi also highlighted a host of reforms like the GST undertaken during the NDA government.
The PM also launched the Ease of Doing Business Grand Challenge. The objective of this challenge is to invite innovative ideas based on Artificial Intelligence, Internet of Things, Big Data Analytics, Blockchain and other cutting-edge technologies to reform government processes. The platform for the Grand Challenge is the Startup India Portal.
India Inc on Monday complimented reforms undertaken by the Modi government to improve the business environment.
Top industrialists including Mahindra Group Chairman Anand Mahindra, Vedanta Resources Executive Chairman Anil Agarwal, CII President Rakesh Bharti Mittal, Kotak Mahindra Bank CEO Uday Kotak, Paytm Founder Vijay Shekhar Sharma and Assocham President B K Goenka, among others, attended the meeting, sources said.
PM Modis progressive reforms have helped India move up the ease of doing business index. Some more push in the natural resources sector & encouraging domestic exploration & production will help India break into top 30, bringing more investment, growth & prosperity, Agarwal said in a tweet.
When he (PM) outlined the target of Indias ranking at 50 in the World Bank Doing Business report, we wondered how could we make it possible. In the last four years, under his (PMs) relentless, untiring and proactive leadership and guidance, continuous monitoring, the endeavour has proceeded with the greatest energy and vigour, Mittal said.
I think everybody was confident that many of these things (reforms) will go very positively in improving the rank of India in the World Bank ranking of ease of doing business.
Another significant discussion was about bringing states and districts on board and make sure that these rankings are held not only at the state level but also at the district level, Assocham Secretary General Uday Kumar Verma said.

PRABHAKARAN SHUT DOOR TO PEACE - AKASHI
In a rare interview on the recent Sri Lankan conflict, the Japanese govts envoy Yasushi Akashi speaks of his unique experience parleying between the govt and the LTTE
Yasushi Akashi was the representative of the Japanese government for Peace-Building, Rehabilitation and Reconstruction in Sri Lanka. He was actively involved in mediating between the Sri Lankan government and the international community and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam (LTTE) from 2002 to 2009, in which year the terrorist organisation was defeated militarily.
As peace envoy, he visited the country at least 30 times, and even after the war, he visited Sri Lanka to push for reconciliation. Prior to his mission in Sri Lanka, Akashi, at the headquarters of the United Nations Secretariat in New York, held positions as Under-Secretary-General of Public Information, Under-Secretary-General for Disarmament Affairs and Under-Secretary-General for Humanitarian Affairs and Emergency Relief Coordinator.
Among many other additional assignments, he was the Secretary-Generals Personal Representative for the war in the former Yugoslavia. He also supervised the Cambodian peace negotiations and subsequent elections in 1993. Akashi is the current Chairman of the International House of Japan.
The Daily News caught up with him on November 7, to discuss the Sri Lankan conflict and his experience in it after all these years.
Excerpts of the interview:
Q: What were your priorities when you took over duties as the representative of the Government of Japan for Peace-Building, Reconciliation and Reconstruction in Sri Lanka
A: I started my mission of peace-building and reconciliation in Sri Lanka in 2002. We had a good agreement with the Norwegians who were already there. The special interest of Japan was to contribute to promoting and consolidating peace in Sri Lanka with Japans special competence and experience on the development side. In 2003, we convened the Tokyo conference to support rehabilitation and development in Sri Lanka. And 51 governments and more than 20 international organisations, including the UN, participated in that conference.
We adopted a declaration on peace in Sri Lanka by consensus, and I remember the Prime Minister at that time  Ranil Wickremesinghe  was in tears when I announced the total sum of US$ 4.5 billion which was committed for the purpose of rehabilitation and consolidating of peace in Sri Lanka, by the international community.
We wanted to show all parties in Sri Lanka that the international community was solidly behind their efforts for peace. But the LTTE did not see fit to come to Tokyo and participate in that conference.
The international community was prepared to go beyond even the US$ 4.5 billion if the relevant parties in Sri Lanka agreed to make further progress towards real peace.
Q: But just before the Tokyo conference, both the LTTE and a team from the Sri Lankan government held talks in Japan, isnt it
A: Yes, just before the Tokyo conference we had the sixth session of negotiations with the government and the LTTE which took place in Hakone in Japan. Anton Balasingham from the LTTE, and Minister G.L. Peiris and the delegation from the Sri Lankan government, and also Norwegian representatives took part. There was great hope at that time but things began to deteriorate later.
Q: You also had talks with the LTTE leader
A: I had one opportunity to meet LTTE leader Velupillai Prabhakaran. That was in Kilinochchi in 2003 and it was a long meeting. We had a lengthy discussion about the prospects of peace and our expectations from the LTTE to accept peaceful negotiations with the government. I strongly urged Prabhakaran to use the opportunity. But I later realised that Prabhakaran was not inclined to accept peaceful negotiations. After our discussion in the morning, we had lunch together and after lunch, he relaxed a bit. The morning talks were very formal and intensive.
After lunch, it was more of an informal chat. During that time, Prabhakaran spoke about his son, family, and his hopes. He opened up in the afternoon. He had a good image of Japan. He said he longed for the day when Sri Lanka became a peaceful and developed country like Japan. I saw two different faces of Prabhakaran. I like to believe his afternoon face more than his morning face.
I profoundly regret that he missed all the opportunities given to him. The Tokyo conference was a great opportunity, and after the Indian Ocean tsunami, then President Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga came up with a rebuilding programme in which the LTTE was invited to participate. But he shut the door at that time as well. There were other occasions where Prabhakaran told Northern Tamils not to participate in elections. He lost so many opportunities for peace and peaceful negotiations.
Q: Did the LTTE leadership contact you during the last stages of the war
A: A few days before the end of the war, I was contacted by the LTTE at my hotel in Colombo. It was an attempt by the LTTE for some kind of ceasefire and they were seeking my help. The person who called me was the political director of the LTTE. I told him a mere ceasefire will not suffice, and it must be accompanied with offers such as laying down arms and releasing civilians. So he said he will go back to Prabhakaran and convey my thoughts about more comprehensive and serious efforts. He never called back.
Q: Do you think Prabhakaran would have ever agreed to a negotiated political solution
A: On the advice of people like Anton Balasingham, Thamilselvan and others who had experience and knowledge about conflict situations, the LTTE had examined what possibilities there were for a negotiated settlement. But my impression in hindsight was that Prabhakaran was intoxicated with military victories and became overconfident in his own power.
His mind was probably that of a terrorist in the end and he antagonised not only Sinhala and other people, but he also killed some of his own colleagues and political leaders like Lakshman Kadirgamar, Rajiv Gandhi, R. Premadasa, Gamini Dissanayake and so on. His supporters left him one by one. So in the end, he was his own enemy.
Q: You came to Sri Lanka in the immediate aftermath of the war
A: I think after the end of the conflict, heroic efforts were made on the part of the government to enable refugees to be taken care of. The war ended with a lot of bloodshed and tragedy, but I had the impression that sections of the international community did not see the facts in Sri Lanka as they were, but wanted to pick up some developments and criticise the government.
After the end of war in 2009, Sri Lanka has been trying hard to achieve real peace, reconciliation and more secure democratic progress. But it seems with the recent political events in the last few days, democracy in Sri Lanka faces another challenge.
Q: What are your thoughts on the reaction of the international community to the UN Expert Panel report on the Sri Lankan war, which was later dubbed the Darusman Report
A: It is a long and complex report which deals with many different aspects in relation to the final showdown and even the aftermath of the war. There were several passages of oversimplification in that report. That is why this report should be read and interpreted as a whole, not just some parts, while ignoring other parts. I was not pleased with interpretations of that report by some sections of the international community.
Q: What about the report of the Lessons Learnt and Reconciliation Commission (LLRC)
A: I think many constructive measures were proposed by the LLRC to foster a process of lasting peace and reconciliation. Proposals such as the investigation of cases of disappearances and abductions, promotion of a trilingual policy, reduction of high security zones, return of private lands by the military and demilitarisation are praiseworthy. Further, the LLRC recommended speedy resettlement and genuine reconciliation and restoration of normal civilian life in affected areas.
Q: Are you satisfied with the efforts taken to practically implement the above measures
A: We always have big dreams, but we have to start with small steps. I think Sri Lanka made a serious attempt to learn from similar conflicts in other countries. I think it is important to learn from other examples where serious efforts were made for reconciliation after major conflicts.
However, not all cases are identical; therefore, Sri Lanka has to make its own discoveries and experimentations. The Office of Missing Persons, the Reparations Bill and other similar efforts undertaken are steps in the right direction. These are significant steps towards healing of the wounds and coming together of all Sri Lankans.
Q: Can you elaborate on your role in peace-building and reconciliation
A: My efforts were over several years. I negotiated and spoke with the UN, UNHRC and many other organisations and countries. I wanted to avoid oversimplification of the complexity of the conflict. I felt that the Sri Lankan government was unfairly depicted as not wanting a peaceful solution, which is not correct. Also I had discussions with government leaders to show the international community that Sri Lankan leaders minds are not closed to a peaceful solution. In my opinion, there are many different ways you can negotiate and many different ways to alleviate the situation.
Q: Do you think you were able to fully accomplish your mission
A: I regret one promise I made on the occasion when I undertook my mission for peace-building and reconciliation in Sri Lanka. During my first visit, I was invited to visit artistic and historical sites in Sri Lanka and I said that I would very much like to visit these sites. However, I said I would visit these places after I accomplished my mission of peace. So when Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister in 2002, for the first time, he took me to see some of these historical sites which were impressive, but I declined to spend more time visiting them until I had accomplished my mission. That moment of complete accomplishment never came. Much has been achieved and lots of efforts have been undertaken by Sri Lanka since ending the war during the tenure of President Mahinda Rajapaksa in 2009, to make peace an actual reality. But still there is more to do. So I wonder at what moment I will realise my dream.
Q: If there is an invitation to come back here again and help Sri Lanka consolidate peace and reconciliation, will you accept it
A: I have had many meetings with people belonging to different religions and ethnic groups all over Sri Lanka. I think all Sri Lankans are at heart peaceful. I am of the belief that we have all kinds of beliefs and behaviour patterns. But we are basically in search of the same dreams and desires. I have dealt with other conflicts in Cambodia and in Yugoslavia. Even today, some conflicts are continuing.
I have profound respect and friendship for Sri Lankan leaders. Although political lines are drawn at times, I believe all of them are committed to peace, reconciliation and development. We Japanese have deep respect and love for Sri Lankans and the friendly ties between the two nations have strengthened over the years. I always like to see Sri Lanka and Sri Lankans doing well.

Prophet Muhammad: A successful social reformist
Meelad-Un-Nabi: the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is annually celebrated by the Muslims living across the world. Nearly two billion Muslims across the world celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) during the whole month of Rabi-ul-Awwal performing religious prayers, taking part in almsgiving ceremonies, doing charity by helping the needy without regard to race, colour or religion as per the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
Sri Lanka also declares a public and mercantile holiday to commemorate the birth of the Holy Prophet considering the national significance of this special day.
Muslims believe Almighty Allah (SWT) sent His messengers from Prophet Adam (PBUH) to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), from time to time to convey the truth to all mankind and guide them on the right path. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is considered the last and final of all messengers sent by Almighty Allah. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was a perfect example of an honest, just, merciful, compassionate, truthful and brave human being who showered peace and mercy upon all creatures that lived on the face of this earth.
Birth and childhood
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) was born to a noble family in the city of Makkah in the Arabian Peninsula 1,400 years ago in the year 570 AD. According to the Islamic calendar, it is on the twelfth day of the month of Rabi-ul-Awwal. He was the son of Abdulla and Amina. His father Abdulla passed away a few days before his birth. His mother then brought him up with great love and devotion.
When he was about six years old, his mother Amina also passed away. His grandfather Abdul Muthalib and then his uncle Abu Thalib took him into their care. As a young boy, he became known as a person of integrity with high moral standards. Therefore, he was known among the people as Al-Amin  the trustworthy and also as Al-Sadiq  the truthful. Because of these qualities, he was respected by everyone beyond race, colour, gender, age and religion in the city of Makkah.
Family and social life
Prophet Muhammads family life was shaped around Islamic principles ensuring peace and happiness in the family. His family life was a good example to his followers. He simply showed what peace and happiness in family life is all about. He taught his followers saying, The best among you are those who behave best towards their wives. The best among you is the one who is the kindest to his wife and the worst among you is the one who treats his wife badly.
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) raised four daughters. He educated them and got them married to pious husbands. Even though his children were married and had children of their own, Prophet Muhammad still rushed to his daughters houses, and he loved his grandchildren very much. Being a respectful husband and a loving father to his children and grandchildren, he showed a good example of peaceful family life in the way of Islamic teaching, to his followers.
As a businessman, he used to give needy people whatever he earned. He was extremely generous and sociable himself. He encouraged his followers in the same way. One of his companions asked the Prophet, which act in Islam is the best, and Prophet Muhammad replied to feed the poor and needy people whether Muslim or non-Muslim and greet the people you know and those you do not, regardless of religion or race.
Abu Huraira (RA), one of the companions of the Prophet who narrated more than 5,000 hadiths (a collection of daily practices of the Prophet) said Prophet Muhammad was telling his followers to refrain from being angry, because an angry person cannot control his mind at all. Anger is not the quality of a strong person. A strong person is the one who can control his anger.
Prophethood and spiritual life
When Muhammad (PBUH) was 38 years of age, he chose the cave in the mountain Hira where he often spent time in meditation and solitude. Then he used to retire with food and water and spend days and weeks in meditation in remembrance of the Creator, Almighty Allah. Once he became a prophet at the age of 40, he started his mission to guide people towards the right path through kindness and mercy. Muslims all over the world follow his guidance as the last and final Prophet of Almighty Allah and his qualities and character attracted reverence and respect from Islamic and non-Islamic scholars.
He was respected by everyone because of the noble qualities he had. Especially his qualities of humour, kindness, mercy, generosity, equality, pleasantness, modesty, concern about orphans and kids, respect for the people of other religions and religious leaders and his peace-loving nature touched everyones heart, regardless of race, colour, gender, religion and faith.
Respect for other religions
During the time of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the Arabian Peninsula in which various faiths were present, there were Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, polytheists and others not affiliated to any religion. When one looks into the life of the Prophet, one may draw on many examples to portray the high level of tolerance shown to people of other faiths. In the city of Medina, as the ruler, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) showed how to treat the people of other faiths with great respect.
When he established a constitutional system, he confirmed that no one has the right to bully or annoy anyone else for their religious beliefs or rituals, and anyone, anywhere in the world, is free to live according to their religion as long as their beliefs avoided harmfulness to others. All were considered members and citizens of Medina society regardless of religion, race or ancestry. As the ruler, he protected the people of other faiths from harm as much as the Muslims. When he started as the ruler of Medina, there were provinces which followed their own system according to their tribes. The Prophet gathered these different tribes under one system of governance equally treating them under one constitutional system. This is a good example for todays leaders to learn.
Role of a social reformist
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) showed exceptional traits in religious services and in handling secular issues using his leadership skills. He taught monotheism. He taught them to respect parents and elders. He taught to respect women. He taught to respect the people of other faiths, He taught respect for ones neighbour, regardless of religion or race. He taught how to live with other communities.
He taught them equality and justice without regard to race, colour, religion and faith. Because of these renowned qualities, non-Muslim thinkers and well-known scholars have written several books about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in later centuries. He was always observed as a person of morality, honesty, truthfulness, and understanding.
Edward Gibbon, a notable English historian, scholar and writer, has written in his book, History of the Saracen Empire (1870), about Prophet Muhammad, thus: The greatest success of Mohammads life was sheer moral force without the stroke of a sword. Reverend Bosworth Smith, Late Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford said, without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a place, without a fixed revenue, if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by a right divine, it was Muhammad; for he had all the power without instruments and without its support. (Muhammadanism, London, 1874)
Aspiring leadership
Even today, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is recognised by non-Muslim scholars as the most influential person throughout history. Todays renowned scholars talk about the leadership qualities of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his powerful mission to keep the religion alive today and the successful decisions made by him in different circumstances to overcome critical issues. The Leadership of Muhammad is a management book based on the life story and leadership skills of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), by Professor John Adair, a British academic, leadership theorist and an author of more than 40 books on business and other leadership.
In this book, Professor Adair has taken examples from the life of Prophet Muhammad to highlight his extraordinary qualities as a leader.
Professor Adair weaves the Prophets life together with aspects of Bedouin culture and ancient proverbs to provide key point for leaders and aspiring leaders and has also taken examples of tribal leadership and essential attributes such as integrity, moral authority and humility of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
Further, he describes in this book how Prophet Muhammads understanding of the tribal norms of Arabia helped him become an inspirational and effective leader, focusing on the qualities and personality traits that made the Prophet an exceptional leader, political authority, and a humane role model.
George Bernard Shaw describes in his book Genuine Islam published in 1936, the leadership of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH): if a man like Prophet Muhammad were to assume the leadership of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring in much-needed peace and happiness.
As a leader, there are some general characteristics that an individual must possess to become a successful leader such as confidence, honesty, communication skills, empathy, optimism, encouragement, intuition, acting as a role model and so on. For Muslims, no one has ever come closer to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in having leadership distinctiveness and they consider Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as the greatest reformist and leader. According to modern scholars points of view, the leadership style showed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a good example in solving global issues to bring in much-needed peace and happiness.
Humanity of Prophet Muhammad
Well-known personalities and renowned scholars have quoted the noble qualities and humanity of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Shaw said in his book Genuine Islam, I have studied him  a wonderful man and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ, he must called the Saviour of Humanity.
Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi said in the journal Young India, I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days it was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet Muhammad, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and his own mission.
He was complete in every regard with a beacon of guidance for people of every walk of life.
And that personality would undeniably be the personality of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Muslims follow his guidance because he is the Prophet of Almighty Allah and those do not follow Islam also hold him in high regard when it comes to human character because he was a secular as well as a religious leader.
American astrophysicist Michael H. Hart ranked Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as No.1 in his book The 100  a rank of the most influential persons in history published in 1978. Hart says, He was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the secular and religious level.
Prophets last days
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) continued to lead his community both spiritually and in earthly matters until his death in 632. On June 8, 632 AD (Twelfth day of Rabi-Ul- Awwal) Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) passed away at the age of 63 after a short illness. His 23 years of powerful prophetic mission and guidance 1400 year ago is realistic and result-oriented.




















Meelad-Un-Nabi: the birth anniversary of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is annually celebrated by the Muslims living across the world. Nearly two billion Muslims across the world celebrate the birth of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) during the whole month of Rabi-ul-Awwal performing religious prayers, taking part in almsgiving ceremonies, doing charity by helping the needy without regard to race, colour or religion as per the teachings of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).

Especially his qualities of humour, kindness, mercy, generosity, equality, pleasantness, modesty, concern about orphans and kids, respect for the people of other religions and religious leaders and his peace-loving nature touched everyones heart, regardless of race, colour, gender, religion and faith.

Respect for other religions
During the time of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in the Arabian Peninsula in which various faiths were present, there were Christians, Jews, Zoroastrians, polytheists and others not affiliated to any religion. When one looks into the life of the Prophet, one may draw on many examples to portray the high level of tolerance shown to people of other faiths. In the city of Medina, as the ruler, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) showed how to treat the people of other faiths with great respect.
When he established a constitutional system, he confirmed that no one has the right to bully or annoy anyone else for their religious beliefs or rituals, and anyone, anywhere in the world, is free to live according to their religion as long as their beliefs avoided harmfulness to others. All were considered members and citizens of Medina society regardless of religion, race or ancestry. As the ruler, he protected the people of other faiths from harm as much as the Muslims. When he started as the ruler of Medina, there were provinces which followed their own system according to their tribes. The Prophet gathered these different tribes under one system of governance equally treating them under one constitutional system. This is a good example for todays leaders to learn.

Role of a social reformist
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) showed exceptional traits in religious services and in handling secular issues using his leadership skills. He taught monotheism. He taught them to respect parents and elders. He taught to respect women. He taught to respect the people of other faiths, He taught respect for ones neighbour, regardless of religion or race. He taught how to live with other communities.
He taught them equality and justice without regard to race, colour, religion and faith. Because of these renowned qualities, non-Muslim thinkers and well-known scholars have written several books about Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in later centuries. He was always observed as a person of morality, honesty, truthfulness, and understanding.
Edward Gibbon, a notable English historian, scholar and writer, has written in his book, History of the Saracen Empire (1870), about Prophet Muhammad, thus: The greatest success of Mohammads life was sheer moral force without the stroke of a sword. Reverend Bosworth Smith, Late Fellow of Trinity College, Oxford said, without a standing army, without a bodyguard, without a place, without a fixed revenue, if ever any man had the right to say that he ruled by a right divine, it was Muhammad; for he had all the power without instruments and without its support. (Muhammadanism, London, 1874)

Aspiring leadership
Even today, Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is recognised by non-Muslim scholars as the most influential person throughout history. Todays renowned scholars talk about the leadership qualities of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) and his powerful mission to keep the religion alive today and the successful decisions made by him in different circumstances to overcome critical issues. The Leadership of Muhammad is a management book based on the life story and leadership skills of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH), by Professor John Adair, a British academic, leadership theorist and an author of more than 40 books on business and other leadership.
In this book, Professor Adair has taken examples from the life of Prophet Muhammad to highlight his extraordinary qualities as a leader.
Professor Adair weaves the Prophets life together with aspects of Bedouin culture and ancient proverbs to provide key point for leaders and aspiring leaders and has also taken examples of tribal leadership and essential attributes such as integrity, moral authority and humility of the Prophet Muhammad (PBUH).
Further, he describes in this book how Prophet Muhammads understanding of the tribal norms of Arabia helped him become an inspirational and effective leader, focusing on the qualities and personality traits that made the Prophet an exceptional leader, political authority, and a humane role model.
George Bernard Shaw describes in his book Genuine Islam published in 1936, the leadership of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH): if a man like Prophet Muhammad were to assume the leadership of the modern world, he would succeed in solving its problems in a way that would bring in much-needed peace and happiness.
As a leader, there are some general characteristics that an individual must possess to become a successful leader such as confidence, honesty, communication skills, empathy, optimism, encouragement, intuition, acting as a role model and so on. For Muslims, no one has ever come closer to Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) in having leadership distinctiveness and they consider Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as the greatest reformist and leader. According to modern scholars points of view, the leadership style showed by Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) is a good example in solving global issues to bring in much-needed peace and happiness.

Humanity of Prophet Muhammad
Well-known personalities and renowned scholars have quoted the noble qualities and humanity of Prophet Muhammad (PBUH). Shaw said in his book Genuine Islam, I have studied him  a wonderful man and in my opinion far from being an anti-Christ, he must called the Saviour of Humanity.
Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi said in the journal Young India, I became more than ever convinced that it was not the sword that won a place for Islam in those days it was the rigid simplicity, the utter self-effacement of the Prophet Muhammad, the scrupulous regard for his pledges, his intense devotion to his friends and followers, his intrepidity, his fearlessness, his absolute trust in God and his own mission.
He was complete in every regard with a beacon of guidance for people of every walk of life.
And that personality would undeniably be the personality of Prophet Muhammad (Peace and blessings of Allah be upon him). Muslims follow his guidance because he is the Prophet of Almighty Allah and those do not follow Islam also hold him in high regard when it comes to human character because he was a secular as well as a religious leader.
American astrophysicist Michael H. Hart ranked Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) as No.1 in his book The 100  a rank of the most influential persons in history published in 1978. Hart says, He was the only man in history who was supremely successful on both the secular and religious level.

Prophets last days
Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) continued to lead his community both spiritually and in earthly matters until his death in 632. On June 8, 632 AD (Twelfth day of Rabi-Ul- Awwal) Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) passed away at the age of 63 after a short illness. His 23 years of powerful prophetic mission and guidance 1400 year ago is realistic and result-oriented.

Records, crowds, wickets and sixes: Group stage had it all
Two countries from among the West Indies, one an island and one on the South American mainland, hosted the group stages of the ICC Womens World T20 2018, providing conditions that were as different as the nations themselves.
The Guyana National Stadium in Georgetown was a high-scoring venue, despite much talk of low and slow wickets. Rain was a big threat at the Daren Sammy National Cricket Stadium in Gros Islet, Saint Lucia. But the venue then proved a swing bowlers paradise, providing for absorbing if somewhat low scoring- cricket matches.
The common thread was that both groups saw performances that showcased the incredible development of the womens game, further proof that the tournament deserved its own spotlight as a stand-alone event. Lets look back at some of them:
HARMANPREETS HEROICS
There a few batters in world cricket who can unite audiences like Harmanpreet Kaur; when she gets going, you want her to keep batting even if shes making runs against your team. Known as a big-match player, Harmanpreet chose the perfect occasion the first game of the tournament to score her highest score in T20Is, with an astounding 101 off 53 balls. Harmanpreet has hit a total of 12 sixes so far, the highest by any player in this ICC Womens World T20, eight of which came in that century.
DOTTIN THE DESTROYER
Deandra Dotiin may be the first woman to have two T20I hundreds to her name, but it was her bowling that made an impact in the home teams first game of the tournament. After the Windies were bowled out for just 106 for eight against Bangladesh, Dottins pace and swing was too much for Bangladesh to handle.
She took five for five in her four overs, the best ever bowling figures in ICC Womens World T20, and is currently the leading wicket-taker in the tournament with nine scalps.
RED-HOT HEALY
Wicketkeeper Alyssa Healy has been busy in front of the stumps: she has won three Player of the Match awards in the three games she batted in, scoring 48, 56 not out and 53, and is the tournaments third highest run getter. Her first half-century came off just 21 balls, a tournament record, and threatened the fastest T20I fifty ever by three balls.
The Australia opener has batted with frightening consistency over the last few months, having scored six fifties in her last eight innings. After suffering a mild concussion in her last group game, her team will hope that she recovers in time for their semi-final against the hosts on Thursday (22 November).
SUPER SHRUBSOLE
After starring in the final of the ICC Womens World Cup last year, Anya Shrubsole claimed only the second ever hat-trick in an ICC Womens World T20 when she blanked out South Africas tail to finish with three for 11. Shrubsole prospered in the swing friendly conditions in Gros Islet, and followed up with a haul of three for 10 against the defending champions in Englands last group game. With that, she became the joint-highest wicket-taker in the tournaments history, with 33 wickets in 21 games.
SEA OF SIXES
As Sophie Devine launched one into the stands on her way to a record-equaling fifty against Ireland, the tally of sixes for the tournament moved past the previous record of 57. Sixty-five sixes have been hit so far, with the tournament living up to its top billing, with three games yet to come. With boundaries at both venues at the maximum of 65 yards (with the exception of rain affected games in Saint Lucia), it is a testament to the improved skill and fitness levels across all teams.
CROWD COUNT
The Guyana National Stadium saw crowds of more than 3000 on the last day, with many staying long after the cricket had ended on De Party Mound. But the Daren Sammy Stadium in Saint Lucia stole the show, with the locals turning up in droves to support the home team. The last two games the Windies played saw more than 11,000 people pass through the turnstiles, packing the venue and creating an atmosphere rivaled by few venues in the world.
I cannot remember the last time the Daren Sammy Cricket Ground was packed like this, said the man himself, Daren Sammy. This goes way beyond just this tournament. It will send a strong message to all the young girls in Saint Lucia, that if you aspire to play cricket for the West Indies, you can excel.
This was a success for the next generation, he added.
The action now moves to the Sir Vivian Richards Cricket Ground in Antigua and Barbuda on Thursday (22 November), where the defending champions Windies will face Australia in the first semi-final at 16h00 local time and then India will take on England at 20h00. And if the tournament so far is anything to go by, one can expect entertaining cricket on the field, and a riveting atmosphere off it, perhaps even better than Saint Lucia.
As Sammy said: Now we go to Antigua, and they have to match this.  ICCmedia

Reverse Pinocchio
Pinocchio may be just a childrens fairy tale, but Spanish scientists at the University of Granada recently investigated the so-called Pinocchio effect and found that our noses dont grow when we tell a lie, but actually shrink a bit.
Dr Emilio Gmez Miln and his team developed a lie detector test that used thermography to tell if people were lying, and found that whenever participants in their research were being untruthful, the temperature of the tip of their nose dropped up to 1.2 degrees Celsius, while the temperature of their forehead increased up to 1.5C. Scientist also found that drop in temperature at nose level actually caused it to slightly shrink, although the difference is undetected by the human eye. One has to think in order to lie, which rises the temperature of the forehead, Dr. Gmez Miln explained the findings. At the same time we feel anxious, which lowers the temperature of the nose.
For this study, researchers asked a number of 60 students to perform various tasks while being scanned by thermal imaging technology.
One of these tasks involved calling a 3 to 4 minutes call to their parents, partner or a friend and telling a significant lie.
Participants had to devise the lie themselves during the call, and the thermal cameras picked up this reverse Pinocchio effect caused by the fluctuation in temperature in the nose and forehead.
Interestingly, the thermal lie detector picked up the temperature difference in 80 percent of test subjects, which is a better rate of success than that of any modern lie detector.
With this method we have achieved to increase accuracy and reduce the occurrence of false positives, something that is frequent with other methods such as the polygraph, said Dr. Emilio Gmez Miln, who added that law enforcement interviewers could one day combine other lie detection technology with thermal imaging to achieve better results.

Smith, Warner to serve out bans  in full - Cricket Australia
SYDNEY, Tuesday: Steve Smith and David Warner will serve out their one-year bans in full after a review of the punishments by the board of Cricket Australia (CA), the governing body said on Tuesday.
Former test captain Smith and his vice-captain Warner were handed the bans from international and state cricket after the ball-tampering scandal that rocked Australian Cricket in March this year.
Batsman Cameron Bancroft was also banned for nine months for his role in trying to alter the condition of the ball during a test match against South Africa in Cape Town. He will be able to return to representative cricket at the end of December.
The players union, the Australian Cricketers Association (ACA), have always contested the bans were unduly harsh and had pushed for all three to be able to resume first class cricket immediately.
The Cricket Australia Board has carefully considered all elements of the ACA submission and has determined that it is not appropriate to make any changes to the sanctions handed down to the three players, CAs chairman Earl Eddings said in a statement.
Calls for the bans to be looked at again intensified after an independent review into CA last month said the governing body had contributed to the ball-tampering scandal by fostering a win without counting the costs culture.
That review led to the resignation of CA chairman David Peever, who had forcefully maintained that the players should see out the full terms of their suspensions.
The original decision of the board to sanction the players was determined after rigorous discussion and consideration, Eddings, Peevers temporary replacement, added.
CA maintains that both the length and nature of the sanctions remain an appropriate response in light of the considerable impact on the reputation of Australian cricket, here and abroad.
The ACA said in a statement it respectfully disagreed with CAs decision, which it regarded as disappointing.
It remains the ACAs view that a recalibration of these sanctions would have been a just outcome, it continued.
The ACA has done all it could in support of our submission, and now considers the matter closed.
Eddings in any case made it clear that no further submissions for a review of the punishments would be heard by the CA board.
We believe the ongoing conversation about reducing the sanctions puts undue pressure on the three players  all of whom accepted the sanctions earlier this year - and the Australian mens cricket team, he said.

Sri Lanka gain automatic qualification for 2020 Womens World T20
Victory over Bangladesh and a no-result against England meant Sri Lanka wont have to qualify for the World T20 2020, but losses against South Africa and the Windies ensured their campaign ended in the group stages.
Sri Lankas campaign got off to a damp start, with heavy rain causing their game against England to be abandoned without a ball bowled.
They were then razed by the pace of Shabnim Ismail, who claimed three victims, all bowled, as Sri Lanka slumped to 99/8 against South Africa. Though they struck with consecutive deliveries across the first and second overs in the chase, the Proteas completed a seven wicket win.
Bangladesh limited them to an even smaller total, Jahanara Alam taking three wickets to keep them to 97/7. They rallied in the defence however, with Chamari Atapattu claiming 3/17 and Shashikala Siriwardana 2/10  to go with a vital 31 earlier in the day  as Bangladesh were bowled out for 72.
Sri Lanka finally reached three figures in their final game, with Atapattu standing out for her 35-ball 44 but their 104 paled in comparison to Windies 187/5. The top order of Hayley Matthews, Deandra Dottin, and Stafanie Taylor  all of whom scored more than 40 at a strike rate above 140  proved too hot for them to handle.
POSITIVES TO TAKE HOME
Apart from the honour of being part of women's international's millionth ball, as heartening that was, in snatches, Sri Lanka suggested they could compete, with at least one performance from each game lifting them.
Siripali Weerakoddy and Udeshika Prabodani combined well at the start of South Africas innings, while Oshadhi Ranasinghe managed to claim tight figures of 1/21 even as the Windies batters wreaked havoc elsewhere.
The class of Siriwardana and Atapattu is long established, but for them to put in match-winning performances against Bangladesh and contribute elsewhere re-emphasised their value.
There are players with the capability to trouble the top sides, and if Sri Lanka can string together a few performances, they may prove a handful in future.
AREAS TO IMPROVE
Sri Lankas batting has often been their Achilles heel, and it was so again in the Caribbean. Totalling less than 300 runs across three innings, with a high team score of just 104 made for sorry reading.
Just three of their players averaged more than 11 with the bat, and no one scored at more than a run a ball.
Atapattu and Siriwardana did the best they could to repair the damage, but considering besides them those in the top five averaged 6.67, there was only so much they could do.
STANDOUT PLAYER
As she so often does, Shashikala Siriwardana stood up when few of her team mates did, with both bat and ball. She was joint-leading wicket taker for Sri Lanka, and one off being joint-leading run-scorer as well.
When Sri Lankas campaign was alive, she was world-class, top-scoring in their first two games and claiming brilliant figures of 3/22 across eight overs against Bangladesh and South Africa, before the Windies put a dent in her numbers.

Behaviour beyond reproach
St. Marys College, Negombo
Head Boy of St. Marys College Negombo, Elphege Gunasekara understands that we live in a fast-changing world. And in order to meet the expectations of this fast-changing world he has developed strong principles. Perfect Prefects features Gunasekara whose actions speak louder than words.
While kindness is important and essential, proper conduct and being principled is more than simply being a nice person. It involves a standard of behaviour that society demands from us. It involves more than simply being affable. It involves doing a job properly when a task is assigned to you and not getting into the habit of making excuses.
Orderly society
I think it is imperative that a child learns how to conduct himself/herself in society in a manner that befits someone who is responsible and dependable. Action and behaviour must be beyond reproach. Today sadly, some people in society do not adhere to the rules that have been set in place to create an orderly society. This is because righteousness has not been ingrained in the child and as a result, they do not have the ability to judge well, said Gunasekara.
Gunasekara feels that problems and difficulties are actually opportunities to climb up the ladder of success. You learn to be able to make choices that will lead to a lifestyle that is productive and successful. The more you overcome the more you open up avenues for yourself.
School is an institution that affords the child an opportunity to experience life in a manner that is safe. Within this controlled environment, the child learns how to interact with other human beings so that when he/she leaves school and joins the workforce outside he/she will possess the skills needed to meet and overcome the challenges thrown at him or her. That is what my school has given to me. If you take me, at my school I have had leadership positions throughout my school life, explained Gunasekara.
Gunasekara says that right throughout his education he has been nurtured and taught right from wrong. His teachers have helped him develop his personality and refined his leadership skills. He is the leader of his school brass band. Stability is something that his school has given him. He has developed organizational skills and learnt to be genial. He delegates responsibilities to those under him in a manner that is fair and sees that his directions are carried out.
Direct effect
I feel that setting an example is the best way to see change. The young especially are very impressionable. You need to realize that your actions and words have a direct effect on how a younger person will perceive life. Perceptions are everything. The boundaries between right and wrong are blurred when it comes to a very young child. In society these days we see that there is very little unity and harmony. You need to be able to have that skill of uniting people that some leaders have, pointed out Gunasekara.
Gunasekara has excelled in his brass band and in cadetting. His dream is to play in the Navy Brass Band after leaving school. Another hobby is motorbike racing. That too is a field that he wants to excel in. Music is a passion of his, the status and recognition of playing in the Navy Brass Band appeal to him.
I think conflict is society is what really troubles me. War is never good for any economy. We see many communities at odds with each other. Conflicts are breaking out all over the world. This is an insanity. Even petty issues in societies and slight provocation create conflicts. Without being selfish we need to and be considerate, added Gunasekara.
Dream and goal
From a very young age, Gunasekara has been interested in bikes. It is a passion of his. He admits that he never thought this dream of his would take him to where he is now. Last year was when he started to take part in races. He has taken part in 150 events and has now set his sights on the 1000 event. He has his own bike that he has modified. He has now taken part in five competitions. He wants to achieve first place and he is certainly ambitious. Taking part in the 1000 event is his dream and goal. While doing his studies he is concentrating on bike riding.
You need to be able to get everyone under your command over the finish line and make a better society. My message to anyone is to make effective and bold decisions and focus on becoming an individual who is useful to society and who can execute the tasks given to him/her. This is very important since you need to use all your energy and complete the task. Again I point out that you need to have that stability. You need to develop that charisma and you need to be approachable. You need to treat everyone equally. If you show initiative people will follow you, explained Gunasekara.
Gunasekara is also someone who believes there needs to be an effective universal body of law and that the law must be respected in any society. He calls for punitive measures to be taken when dealing with anyone who transgresses the law and that no one is beyond the law. This should radically cut down the number of crimes that range from petty crimes to major transgressions.
Pressure is something that we all face both in school life and society. Gunasekara feels that this is normal when one has to shoulder responsibilities. You need to prioritize here he points out. He is no stranger to pressure as he is a cadet and a brass band leader. While mindful of his own advancement he is dedicated towards his school and wants to bring glory to St. Marys College.

## Title: TEN THESES ON SRI LANKAS EXISTENTIAL CRISIS: ROOTS, DYNAMICS, DIMENSIONS
## Supertitle:

TEN THESES ON SRI LANKAS EXISTENTIAL CRISIS: ROOTS, DYNAMICS, DIMENSIONS
The crisis has deep national, social and psychological roots. Our island contains two consciousnesses or two types of consciousness, two competing states of mind. Contrary to myth, the periphery of our island has the longest uninterrupted colonial history in the world; 450 years, from 1505 to 1948. This has resulted in a residue, sedimentation in the consciousness. There are elites, classes, strata, who have a dependent, colonial, pro-imperialist, puppet, parasitic existence and mentality. Not all the classes that live in the islands urban periphery have such a consciousness, but there are handfuls that do, together with their supportive petty bourgeois and lumpen strata. This was the Lipton Circus crowd. In the political lexicon these are known as comprador or intermediary classes, elites; intermediaries between imperialism and the nation. The UNPs current leadership and its supporting civil society represent this comprador consciousness. This has not always been the case with the UNP, and one of the islands least comprador and most patriotic leaders, Premadasa, was also the leader of the UNPbut he was an exception, not the norm, just as Chandrika Kumaratunga was an exception to the collective consciousness of the nationalist SLFP; not the norm. President Sirisena seemed to be a successor to her but he was not and has now returned to the SLFPs nationalist norm.
*The crisis then stems at least in part from the contradiction between a UNP leadership which is neoliberal globalist even by the UNPs standards, and a Head of State and government who is a moderate nationalist and populist in his consciousness. This should come as absolutely no surprise because it was precisely his nationalist-populist profile that made those who reached out to him as candidate in 2005, do sobecause it was only such a profile that could cut into the SLFP vote, splitting it between a Rajapaksa vote and a moderate SLFP one. This was the same strategy that was adopted when General Sarath Fonseka was made the candidate. The point was to break the Sinhala Buddhist vote by means of a dissident or defector, because the UNP leadership, unchanged and entrenched as it was, could not do so on its own. The present contradiction between the President and the current UNP leader is but a mild version that would have manifested itself had Gen Fonseka won the presidential race. The inevitability of this contradiction is proved by the sacking of the same Mr. Wickremesinghe in 2003 and his defeat at a snap election in 2004, called by the cosmopolitan liberal SLFP leader, President Kumaratunga.
*It is an untruth that President Sirisena owes Mr. Wickremesinghe more than Mr. Wickremesinghe owes him. If not for Mr. Sirisena, President Rajapaksa would not have been defeated by Ranil (which is why Gen Fonseka was made candidate in 2010). If not for the defeat of President Rajapaksa, Mr. Wickremesinghe would not have made it to the Prime Ministership. If not for President Sirisenas intervention in August 2015, Mr. Wickremesinghe would not have been PM by means of an election. Had President Sirisena appointed a Special Presidential Commission into the Central Bank bond scam instead of merely a Presidential Commission, and had he intervened to ensure that Dappula de Livera was not prevented from cross-examining the then PM, Mr. Wickremesinghe would not even be in legally dubious occupation of Temple Trees.
*What we are witnessing is not a struggle between democracy and dictatorship. It is a struggle between two models of democracy: Anglo-American liberal democracy and French, Latin American and Russian Presidentialist democracy, with directly elected executive Presidencies being the hub and center of gravity of the system. Russia calls its variant, sovereign democracy in which vertical power is stronger than in Anglo-American liberal democracy with their emphasis on the separation of powers.
*This crisis is an existential crisis for the nation. Political systems of nations change and change back, but the nation and its State must go on. A small island nation cannot survive if its ports airports roadways and oil tank farms are given over to foreigners and its provinces given quasi-federal powers. We simply do not have the geopolitical space for that. We have no safe rear. No defense in depth. We are a mere 18 miles from a hostile Tamil Nadu. This is the permanent situation exemplified by the story of the insomniac Prince Dutugemunu who felt acutely hemmed in. Our militarys morale was being targeted by the Geneva resolution. Our people would have been reduced to penury by the neoliberal budgetary policies and the cutbacks, the economic shock therapy that was being administered. Our people would have been reduced to semi-serf status.
*The crisis takes place in a global setting and the global contestation has local echoes. I dont like people telling me what to do, or rather, trying to tell me what to do, especially when it is hypocrites responsible for millions of needless deaths who do the telling. The world is dividing into powers that stand for a multipolar world order in which sovereignty is respected and every nation gets to be the best and most that they can in keeping with their choices and distinctive ways, and those others who wish to preserve what they call a liberal world order in which they are the undisputed leader. It is the latter and their allies who try to tell us what to do with and in our own country while they are in a mess in their own (punctuated by mass shootings), and devastate other countries all the while. The first category, those who stand for a multipolar world, do not interfere in our domestic affairs; do not patronize us and are respectful of Sri Lankas sovereignty and sense of self worth. It is our good fortune that foremost among such countries are the world most populous and the worlds largest, China and Russia; one with a powerful economy, the other with a powerful military and outstanding leadership. It is our good fortune that these two countries have an ever closer partnership. It is our good fortune that Russia and China taken together constitute a large Eurasian space.
*There is a global battle being fought out with the hegemonic power, which is in slow parabolic historical decline like all empires eventually are, tries to contain both Russia and China at the same timethereby making a huge grand strategic mistake and becoming hugely overstretched. This Eurasian option is on the rise, though the declining empire hopes to use its military and economic power, diminishing as these are in a relative sense, in a desperate gamble to weaken Russia and China. The declining hegemonic power had constructed an Asian sub-system and seeks to keep us locked inside it, so we cannot connect up with our true friend, whose economic power we need, namely China. These hegemons try to keep in place or restore as our rulers, those local stooges who will maintain our island as a base for their effort against China. Thus they interfere in our affairs and even try tactics worked out in places as widely disparate in geography and time as Guatemala and Iran in the 1950s, to Chile in the 1970s and the so-called Color Revolutions in the 1990s and the disastrous Arab spring of the last decade. This includes the Ukrainian model of forcing an elected President out of power.
*The bottom line is this: who owns our island Who will inherit it Those who care enough for it to fight of its independence, sovereignty, unity, territorial integrity and autonomous way of being, including a way of being in the world Or the puppets and stooges, the compradors and lackeys of a declining Empire
*History shows us that a nation will fight for its existence and its autonomous way of being. Sri Lanka did not cave in despite thirty years of virulent terrorism at the hands of a truly globalized and formidable, suicide-bombing terrorist army. It knew whom and in which direction to turn to in order to survive and prevail. And it did so, all the while keeping its democratic system intact. This time too, in the face of the existential crisis and threat, Sri Lanka will turn among its many choices, to a democratic option that can do the job, breaking through resistance of the puppet elites of the long-colonized coastal cities.
*What we are seeing now, the realignment of President Sirisena and Prime Minister Rajapaksa, is as good as it gets when it comes to a soft landing; a soft transition from the neoliberal model. If however, it is forced by neoliberal local resistance and external interventionist pressure, Sri Lanka will, in the existential interests of national survival and recovery, adopt the tougher-minded Eurasian political and more importantly, economic model of a populist-nationalist democracy which does not conform to the norms of liberalism still less neo-liberalism, or even shift to a strong centralized state which had yielded magnificent results in Singapore and China. We shall see, no later than this time next year.
