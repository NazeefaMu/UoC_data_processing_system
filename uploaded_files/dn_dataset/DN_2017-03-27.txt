Turkey's vision for Cyprus
The Eastern Mediterranean is currently fraught with security challenges. Failed states, mass migration and terrorism afflict the region. Amidst this turmoil, however, a golden opportunity exists to resolve one issue that has eluded a lasting settlement for decades. I am referring to the Island of Cyprus. My Government's vision for its future involve transforming the Island into a bastion of peace, stability, cooperation and economic prosperity.
The Cyprus issue is complex. The entity known today as the Republic of Cyprus was a truly unique case. It was a partnership state purposefully designed as such and established nearly sixty years ago on the basis of three international treaties concluded between Great Britain, Turkey, Greece and the two co-founder peoples on the Island, the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. These two communities had been living on the Island, the Turkish and Greek Cypriots. These two communities had been living on the Island for centuries. They were and still are two distinct peoples with different religions, cultures and ethnicities. The special mechanism founded in 1960 aimed to reflect the understanding that these two communities could coexist peacefully side by side, in a functional federation based on their political equality, under guarantees provided by the two motherlands and Great Britain.
Turkey's support
Regrettably, the experiment failed after only three years. The Greek Cypriots forcibly ousted their Turkish Cypriot partners from all the organs of the young state, in open breach of the founding treaties and the Constitution. In 1964, a United Nations Peacekeeping Force was established on the Island to protect the Turkish Cypriots from ethnic cleaning. Though negotiations between the two sides commenced in 1968, in 1974 a military junta in Greece attempted to annex Cyprus and prompted Turkey's intervention in accordance with the 1960 Treaty of Guarantee. In 1983 the Turkish Cypriots set up their own Republic while still striving for reconciliation with their erstwhile partners in the south. That search continues to this day. The goal is a completely new partnership.
The Turkish Cypriots, with Turkey's support, have consistently worked for a just and lasting comprehensive settlement despite the unjust isolation imposed on them by the Greek Cypriot side. Yet it was the Greek Cypriots who rejected numerous UN-sponsored settlement initiatives over the decades. Today the existing status quo on the Island is unacceptable to both sides. A new, prosperous Cyprus without ethnic tensions will thus be welcomed by all concerned.
This new state of affairs can come to life with a successful conclusion of the ongoing UN-sponsored negotiations. Any settlement must fulfil certain criteria in order to be sustainable and just. The two sides on the Island must be politically equal; one side cannot dominate the other or incorporate it as a mere minority. Power has to be shared in a bi-zonal, bi-communal partnership. The EU will ensure that the basic parameters of the settlement are legally anchored within its primary law. A balance between Greece and Turkey will be struck, meaning that Turkish nationals will be treated on an equal footing with Green nationals exclusively on the Island.
Friendship and cooperation
And finally, safeguards will be put in place to prevent any recurrence of the tragic events of the past. The robust framework provided by the existing Treaties of Guarantee and Alliance will continue to ensure the future stability of the Island, where the presence of Turkish forces in the north has effectively been averting any further outbreak of conflict for over four decades. Opinion polls in Northern Cyprus clearly indicate that the vast majority of Turkish Cypriots will not accept a settlement that does not entail Turkish guarantees. Given their traumatic experiences at the hands of the Greek Cypriots in the 60s and early 70s, no one can blame then, especially after the Greek Cypriot side's recent attempt to introduce commemorations in their schools of the 1950 plebiscite on Enosis (union of Cyprus with Greece), to which the actual roots of the Cyprus issue can be traced.
If a comprehensive settlement in this general framework is to be achieved, the Greek Cypriot side must finally acknowledge the Turkish Cypriots as politically equal partners, and take their justified concerns into account.
The Greek Cypriots have much to gain if common sense prevails among them. A settlement will bring with it Turkey's friendship and cooperation, from which Cyprus as a whole will benefit. We can supply enough water over and above the requirements of the entire Island. Hydrocarbon resources can be freely explored and exploited. New shipping avenues will emerge and trade volumes will rise when Turkish ports are opened to Greek Cypriot vessels. Coupled with a settlement's positive impact on Turkish-Greek relations, these developments will usher in a new era of cooperation and prosperity in our region. There will be no losers here; it will be a textbook case of a win-win situation.
Yet this can only be done with courage, political will, and leadership to take the settlement process forward to a successful conclusion. We can no longer afford to become mired in Sisyphean diplomacy. Turkey and the Turkish Cypriot side are determined to reach a settlement in Cyprus. Now is the time for our sustained efforts to be reciprocated. The time has come to go the extra mile, which is the hardest mile of all.

UK Parliament attacker acted alone: Scotland Yard
UK: The brazen terror attack on British parliament which killed four people ended within 82 seconds and was carried out by Khalid Masood who acted alone, Scotland Yard confirmed on Sunday, conceding they may never understand the 52-year-old attackers motive.
Detectives from the Metropolitan Polices Counter Terrorism Command confirmed after detailed probe that the attack started at 14:40:08 (local time) on March 22, when the car that Masood was driving over Westminster Bridge first mounted the northbound pavement.
He continued towards Bridge Street along both the footpath and road until 14:40:38 before crashing into the perimeter fence of the Palace of Westminster. At 14:40:59, the first 999 call was made to the Met, reporting the incident, it said.
Masood left the vehicle and was shot by a police firearms officer inside the Palace of Westminster boundary at 14:41:30.
Our investigation continues at pace. I am grateful for the public support so far, but I am asking for more help. If you knew Khalid Masood and had spoken to him in the months, weeks or days leading up to this attack please come forward, said Met police Indian-origin Deputy Assistant Commissioner Neil Basu, who is the Senior National Coordinator for UK Counter Terrorism Policing.
We still believe that Masood acted alone on the day and there is no information or intelligence to suggest there are further attacks planned, Basu said.
His remarks came after two of the 11 people arrested in connection with the attack were questioned by police to establish whether the attacker acted alone or had associates.
Whilst the attack lasted only 82 seconds it will remain in the memories of many forever. The thoughts of all those working on this investigation are with those so deeply affected, Basu said.
One person remains in custody in connection with the attack after 11 arrests in the aftermath of the attack, he said.
Born as Adrian Russell Ajao in Dartford before converting to Islam, Masood was known to UK police and intelligences services.
He was born to a white mother and black father and is said to have been affected by racism while growing up.
Even if he acted alone in the preparation we need to establish with absolute clarity why he did these unspeakable acts to bring reassurance to Londoners, and to provide answers and closure for the families of those killed and the victims and survivors of this atrocity, Basu said.
We must all accept that there is a possibility we will never understand why he did this. That understanding may have died with him.
Nevertheless, we are determined to understand if Masood was a lone actor inspired by terrorist propaganda or if others have encouraged, supported or directed him. If the latter proves to be the case, they will face justice, he said

VirtusaPolaris continues investment in talent with future architects program
Following the success of its inaugural Future Architects program, VirtusaPolaris recently inducted the second batch of potential architects in its core practice.
As the breadth and depth of knowledge and skills required by a software architect keep expanding, VirtusaPolaris deems it necessary to spearhead this innovative program to help lead consultants prepare for the challenge of becoming software architects and ease their transition into the role.
Thushera Kawdawatta, vice president Technology, VirtusaPolaris, is the chief architect of this program.He is entrusted with ensuring engineering excellence, innovation and maintaining global engineering standards at VirtusaPolaris.
In recent times there has been a shift in client expectations, says Thushera. In order to respond to the rapid changes in demand by millennial consumers, architects must be equipped with the appropriate technology and be able to adapt to the shift in paradigm. Hence, the expectation is for us to provide thought leadership to realize their intended business outcomes.
The program developed in collaboration with the Talent Development team at VirtusaPolaris consists of four assignments, soft skills development training and one ultimate challenge delves into simulated client problems based on real world situations which may be solved in many different ways.
Before enrolling for this program, I only had a vague idea about the responsibilities of an architect. Not only did this program enable me to learn how to technically perform these responsibilities as an architect, it also groomed my soft skills, says Thilina Kularathna, a participant of the Future Architects program who is now working as an associate software architect at VirtusaPolaris.
During the course of the program candidates will present their solutions to a panel of judges made up of senior software architects who will then evaluate each solution and provide candidates with feedback on their strengths and weaknesses, in the solution as well as the presentation.
A core value at VirtusaPolaris is passion. This program helps us identify those individuals who are truly passionate about their work and are willing to step out of their comfort zones, as the assignments have to be done in tandem with their regular responsibilities, says Nishantha Hettiarachchi, senior architect  Technology at VirtusaPolaris, who is one of the panelists.
The six month program is specifically designed to develop the expected skills of a software architect through mentorship, a series of assignments, continuous evaluations, and feedback.
In this process the evaluation panel will not only expect the solutions to be technically brilliant but also for them to be pitched to the panel like they would to a client in real life.

WATER IN THE GREEN ECONOMY: LEGAL RIGHTS FOR WATERWAYS
Our current environmental laws have been largely unable to prevent over-drawn waterways, continued contamination of remaining waters, and disappearing species and habitats. Our legal and economic systems treat the natural world as property that can be exploited and degraded, rather than as an integral ecological partner with its own rights to exist and thrive. Environmental concerns are subsumed to economic growth, leading to dangerously unbalanced relationships among humans and the rest of life on Earth.
Solutions
Re-envision economic systems so that they serve sustainable communities a term which includes both human communities and the wider communities of the natural world; establish legal rights for ecosystems  including waterways  to exist, thrive and evolve. Elements of sustainable environmental communities similarly include healthy nutrients, clean water, biodiversity, restoration in the face of destruction, and thriving, connected habitats. The economy must be viewed as serving human and environmental communities, not the reverse.
Existing laws assume that waterways are to be manipulated for human economic benefit. Recognizing in law the rights of the waterways to exist, thrive and evolve will better guide our behaviour to protect waterway integrity, to the benefit of sustainable human and waterway communities.
Universal Declaration of the Rights of Mother Earth, adopted at April 2010 World Peoples Conference on Climate Change and the Rights of Mother Earth; presented to UN April 2011 says, Mother Earth and all beings have, among other rights: the right to exist, the right to water as a source of life, the right to integral health, and the right to full and prompt restoration for violations of these and other enumerated rights.
Legal response: New Zealand and India in March 2017
A New Zealand river was granted the same legal rights as a human being. The local Maori tribe of Whanganui in the North Island has fought for the recognition of their river  the third-largest in New Zealand  as an ancestor for 140 years.
The reason we have taken this approach is because we consider the river an ancestor and always have, said Gerrard Albert, the lead negotiator for the Whanganui iwi [tribe]. We have fought to find an approximation in law so that all others can understand that from our perspective treating the river as a living entity is the correct way to approach it, as in indivisible whole, instead of the traditional model for the last 100 years of treating it from a perspective of ownership and management.
The new status of the river means if someone abused or harmed it the law now sees no differentiation between harming the tribe or harming the river because they are one and the same.
Chris Finlayson, the Minister for the treaty of Waitangi negotiations, said the decision brought the longest-running litigation in New Zealands history to an end. Te Awa Tupua will have its own legal identity with all the corresponding rights, duties and liabilities of a legal person, said Finlayson in a statement.
Two guardians will be appointed to act on behalf of the Whanganui River, one from the crown and one from the Whanganui iwi.
Uttarakhand High Court accords status of 'living entities' to Ganga, Yamuna
The Uttarakhand High Court last week accorded the status of "living human entities" to the Ganga and Yamuna, two of India's most sacred rivers.Exercising extraordinary jurisdiction vested in the court, a division bench of Justices Rajeev Sharma and Alok Singh of the High Court said, "Holy Rivers Ganga and Yamuna have been declared to be treated as living human entities."
Giving the "legal status" of living humans to the holy rivers, the court ordered that the Director, Namami Gange project for cleaning and rejuvenating the river, the Chief Secretary and the Advocate General of Uttarakhand will act as the "legal parents" of the holy rivers and work as a the human face to protect, conserve and preserve them and their tributaries. These officers will be bound to "uphold the status" of the two rivers and also promote their "health and wellbeing", the court said.The matter related to mining and stone crushing along the banks of the Ganga.
On a PIL filed by Haridwar resident Mohammad Salim, the court ordered the Dehradun District Magistrate to remove encroachment from the Shakti canal of the Ganga at Dhakrani within 72 hours. It ordered that the DM be suspended if he failed to comply with the directive. The court also ordered the authorities to work out the division of various properties between the neighbouring states under Uttar Pradesh Re-Oganisation Act, 2000, a matter pending since the inception of Uttarakhand in the year 2000. The court also directed the government to form a Ganga Management Board within the next eight weeks in accordance with an earlier order of the court in December 2016.
Earlier this month, the Uttarakhand high court came down heavily down upon the Union and the state governments for doing nothing concrete to clean the Ganga.
The worlds third largest river, the Ganga is the holiest Hindu river and also among the dirtiest in the world, with toxic industrial waste and untreated sewage reducing it to a dirty trickle at several places. The 2,500 km river originates from Gangotri in Uttarakhand and criss-crosses several states before emptying into the Bay of Bengal.The Yamuna is its largest tributary and originates from Yamunotri in Uttarakhand.
Earlier this month, the Centre cleared projects worth Rs 1,900 crore for Uttarakhand, Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand, Bihar and Delhi under the Clean Ganga campaign. Of the 20 projects, 13 are in Uttarakhand and will involve setting sewage treatment plants and upgrading the existing ones.

Wave of whales!
The first blue whale on the east coast has been spotted and the season of the ultimate marine mammal excursion has kicked off. Trinco Blu by Cinnamon invites guests to witness an annual marvel - the emergence of the gentle giants of the sea.
Cinnamon Nature Trails Manager of Field Vimukthi Weeratunga.
Harnessing the services of the expert naturalists at Cinnamon Nature Trails (CNT) all guests visiting Trinco Blu by Cinnamon are welcome to explore the annual whale phenomenon, states Cinnamon Grand in a press release.
Guests visiting this resort shall enjoy the cool sandy beaches of Trinco and even catch a glimpse of a great blue whale whilst soaking up the sun. The resort offers the perfect base to set out for a whale watching excursion, as visitors do not have to travel more than 6km into the sea to witness a considerable number of sperm whales and of course the most anticipated blue whales. During this season, Trinco is the whale watching hot spot and CNT will ensure that guests will have as many whale sightings as the weather and tide allows. Further guaranteeing this promise, the CNT team has been GPS tracking the locations of all the eastern whales for the past 6 years.
Escorted by experts from CNT, guests will gain the added bonus of witnessing off-shore birds whilst scouring the sea for the great and playful mammals of the ocean - the whales and the dolphins. Cruising towards the middle of the sea, guests will find themselves surrounded by the beauty of nature. With luck riding onboard, guests just might be entertained by the mega pod of sperm whales. This is a miraculous and rare spectacle, but nonetheless possible, given there are perfect conditions. It is this exhilarating anticipation that a guest of Trinco Blu by Cinnamon is invited to take a chance on.
CNT Field Operations Manager and Wild Life Biologist, Vimukthi Weeratunga states; Whale and Dolphin watching at Trincomalee is a unique experience, as its waters are home to the deepest sea canyon in the country which meets the nutrient rich waters of the Mahaweli River, creating the ideal conditions required for a thriving congregation of marine mammals.
The Indian Ocean was declared as a whale sanctuary in 1981, which in turn had the BBC filming sperm whales in Trinco in 1982, the first recordings of the mega pod in Sri Lankas eastern waters. It is the Cinnamon Nature Trails team with the support of Sri Lanka Navy that initiated the search for whales in the eastern waters at the dawn of peace in 2010 and found that the whale population discovered decades ago were still very much in existence.
Taking it one step further, the CNT team has also developed a unique relationship with the fisher community, teaming up with them as operational partners. The fisher community are now provided with sophisticated engines for their whaler boats to help with the whale watching excursions.

Well come back stronger promises Chandimal
DAMBULLA: Vice-captain Dinesh Chandimal who was the only stand-out batsman with Thisara Perera in Sri Lankas crushing 90-run defeat at the hands of Bangladesh in the first ODI played here on Saturday has promised a better performance in the second ODI of the three-match series scheduled at the same venue for Tuesday.
The defeat is very painful. We are a young group and hopefully they will learn soon and do the right things in the next game, said Chandimal at the post-match press conference.
The defeat follows the one in the second Test match where Bangladesh recorded their maiden Test win over Sri Lanka in 18 Tests. Saturdays ODI win was Bangladeshs fifth against Sri Lanka in 39 matches and their second on Lankan soil.
You cant say every time that this is our transition period. We need to put our hands up and come up with results. All the players should take responsibility from the opportunities they get. Everyone is working hard towards it and hopefully we will be able to see the results soon, said Chandimal.
We have some game plans up our sleeves and we are looking forward to execute them. We are looking forward to improve on our mistakes and come back stronger, he said.
Chandimal admitted that the absence of skipper Angelo Mathews along with that of Niroshan Dickwella and Kusal Perera had somewhat weakened the batting.
Dickwella has been our in-form batsman and Angelo is our best batsman. Its a big blow that we dont have them and Kusal. We are a young team and when we miss some of those guys that is a huge blow. As a team we need to make most of the opportunities, said Chandimal.
Mathews and Perera are nursing injuries while Dickwella served out the second of his two-match ICC ban for dissension in the first ODI and will be available for the second game on Tuesday.
Chandimal put down Bangladeshs win to the experienced one-day players they have in their side.
Since I came into the side we have been beating them easily. But if you take the modern day Bangladesh side they have seven to eight players who have been playing international cricket. They have a lot of experience as this group has been playing together, observed Chandimal.
With Sri Lankas fielding continuing to falter on the field Chandimal was hopeful that it would improve with time.
We were awful on the field. If we had restricted them to about 280, then we could have done something. But we were sloppy on the field, said Chandimal.
We do lot of training with regard to fielding. Theres pressure when we come into the game. There are several young players and there could be mistakes. But we are doing our training well and we are looking forward to sharpening our fielding in the next two games, he said.
Chandimal defended the decision of not including a specialist off-spinner in the side against Bangladeshs left-handers in the top order.
Asela (Gunaratne) can bowl off-spin as well. We wanted Dhanushka (Gunathilaka) to get a few overs as well. We thought that the both of them were able to do the job although we didnt have a specialist off-spinner in the side, said Chandimal.
Instead Sri Lanka played two left-arm spin all-rounders  Sachith Pathirana and Milinda Siriwardana and none of them was made full use of. Pathirana sent down only five overs and Siriwardana didnt get a bowl at all. The result was a match-winning record partnership of 144 runs between left-handers Tamim Iqbal and Shakib Al Hasan.

What made Shakespeare a genius
This country has many great heroes and heroines. Take your pick, from Alfred the Great, who beat off the invading Danish hordes, to Florence Nightingale, the mother of modern nursing; from Queen Elizabeth I, our greatest national leader when this country was emerging as a proud nation state, to Lord Nelson whose naval brilliance ensured the eventual defeat of Napoleon.
What is Shakespeare when compared with these practical heroes and heroines What did the genius who died 400 years ago today do except write plays
Well, he was incomparably the greatest poet in the English language. And he brought to life a cast of unforgettable characters  from melancholy Prince Hamlet to highly comic Bottom the Weaver in Midsummer Nights Dream; from Romeo and Juliets headstrong but doomed heroine to murderous Macbeth.
He also defined all that is best about Britain, having lived at a time of quite amazing national revival. This happy breed of men, this little world, he wrote of our island. This precious stone set in the silver seaThis blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England.
William Shakespeare defined all that is best about Britain, having lived at a time of quite amazing national revival. This happy breed of men, this little world, he wrote of our island
Whoever you choose as your favourite hero, mine will always be William Shakespeare.
More than any other writer, he had the capacity to think himself into the minds of other human beings, and to summarise the great range of our emotions in words that are simple and supremely eloquent.
It is why his plays remain electrifying to this very day, and why they are played over and over again, to audiences all over the world.
Genius
No other individual contributed more words to the English language. Critical, advertising, eyeball, submerge, lonely, obscene are but a handful of the 1,700 or so said to have been brought into general use by Shakespeare.
No one invented more commonly spoken phrases: a sorry sight; all of a sudden; and thereby hangs a tale; as dead as a doornail; as pure as the driven snow; at one fell swoop  these are just a fraction of the ones beginning with the letter a.
Choose another letter  s for example  and you can find salad days; sea change; send him packing; set your teeth on edge; and stiffen the sinews, among a litany of other examples.
His characters, complex and riddled with human imperfections, are as universal as the problems they face in his dramas.
The 19th-century essayist William Hazlitt observed that Shakespeares genius shone equally on the evil and on the good, on the wise and the foolish, the monarch and the beggar.
He dramatised all his creations different concerns  their passions, follies, vices, virtues, actions, motives  in a way that everyone still understands and empathises with today.
Desdemona, innocently in love with her homicidally jealous husband Othello. Henry V, a soldier among soldiers talking to his men on the night before battle. Macbeth the psychopath killer. A broken King Lear howling in despair during a storm.
Word power
No one invented more commonly spoken phrases: a sorry sight; all of a sudden; and thereby hangs a tale; as dead as a doornail; as pure as the driven snow; at one fell swoop  these are just a fraction of the ones beginning with the letter a
They are all so vividly real that we know them almost as well as we know our own families.
In fact, so visceral, so harrowing is Lears desolation that some used to consider the play beyond the pale.
To see Lear acted  to see an old man tottering about the stage with a walking-stick, turned out of doors by his daughters in a rainy night, has nothing in it but what is painful and disgusting, wrote the Regency critic Charles Lamb.
But it was England, and our nations prodigious reinvention of itself during Shakespeares own lifetime, that gave him his first great themes. When he was 24 years old, in 1588, England was threatened with invasion by the Spanish Armada, which aimed to sail up the Channel, smash the Royal Navy, and then bring an army of 30,000 across from Dunkirk.
Philip II of Spain was poised to take over England, kill her Queen and force her subjects back into the Roman Catholic Church  just as we had established ourselves as an Anglican country.
Francis Drake and the other naval officers who led the resistance to this enormous enterprise were a terrifying lot. They won. The weather was on their side, and any Spanish ships they failed to sink were blown around our coast, some wrecked off Scotland, others off Ireland. No wonder Queen Elizabeth had a medal struck with the words: God blew with his winds and they were scattered. It really looked as if England had the wind in its sails.
Philip II of Spain was poised to take over England, kill her Queen and force her subjects back into the Roman Catholic Church  just as we had established ourselves as an Anglican country. Francis Drake (pictured) and the other naval officers who led the resistance to this enormous enterprise were a terrifying lot. They won and no wonder Prince Charles thought it apposite to read a passage from Shakespeares Henry VIII about the first Elizabeth as a birthday tribute to his mother this week: She shall be, to the happiness of England, An aged princess; many days shall see her, And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
Proud certainty
It was a glorious time for England and from the proud certainty of that Elizabethan age, Shakespeare looked back at the previous century when the country had been torn to bits by civil wars  the so-called Wars of the Roses.
Using contemporary chronicles of those wars, he turned them into the great drama of his early plays.
Richard II, dithering, effete and pathetic. The repellent but impressive figure of Henry Bolinbroke, who overthrew Richard and became Henry IV. His son, wasting his life away in the taverns of Londons Eastcheap with the most fascinating, dissolute comic character ever invented  the fat, vain and tragic knight John Falstaff.
And then, that same son, Prince Hal, growing into Henry V who beat the French at Agincourt.
English history, with all the vivid personal dramas attached to it, came alive before the Elizabethans very eyes. William Shakespeare was born in Stratford-upon-Avon, Warwickshire, into an adventurous country which was in every sense renewing itself renewing its trade, its industry, and its expansion overseas.
He was a grammar school boy who learnt Latin and possibly Greek, and was given a solid grounding in the great classical works of Ovid, Horace, Virgil, Cicero and Seneca. All the evidence suggests he left school in his early teens to help his father, an impecunious tanner and wool trader, and then became an actor.
It was a time when great literature was flowering in England: Shakespeares contemporaries or near contemporaries included Edmund Spenser whose epic The Faerie Queene was an allegory of Britains political expansion; the plays of Christopher Marlowe (Dr Faustus), Ben Jonson (Volpone), and a dozen others were all being produced. In London, the modern theatre was invented. Up to this point, plays had been performed on make-shift stages in the open air.
Firm views
This probably explains why, in 1941, Joseph Stalin banned Hamlet. As the U.S. historian Arthur P. Mendel explained, the idea of a thoughtful, reflective hero who took nothing on faith, and who intently scrutinized life around him to try to separate truth from falsehood without prompting, seemed criminal to the Soviet dictator and his thought police.
Shakespeares plays teem with varied characters, throb with passion, and pulsate with intellectual energy precisely because Shakespeare did not attach himself to ideology. People have tried to persuade themselves he was a Catholic, an agnostic, a fascist or communist. Perhaps he was all these things inside his head.
Ideologues think it is not possible to hold incompatible opinions. Shakespeare shows that it is not only more than possible, but that many if not most of us are in that position. Having firm views on every subject under the sun might make sense to fanatics but to the rest of us its the start of madness. At the beginning of every production of Hamlet the audience wonders: Why cant he simply make up his mind By the end, if the play has worked, the confusion and ambiguity of what it means to be human will make decisive figures in the play  such as Hamlets uncle Claudius, who murdered the young princes father and stole both the queen and crown seem the weirdos.
The doubting prince has become our friend. His lack of ideology, his absence of fanaticism and inability tobe doctrinaire, epitomise so much of the human condition.
They are traits that also happen to be very, very English. -Daily Mail.uk

Woman immolates herself
A 71-year-old woman had committed suicide by setting fire herself outside a kitchen of a Home for Elders at Uuraniya, Mahiyanganaya.
The woman had died in the Mahiyanganaya Base Hospital on March 20 while undergoing treatment. She was found burning outside the kitchen of Sri Sambodhi Home for Elders by neighbours and rushed to the Uuraniya divisional hospital and later she was transferred to the Mahiyanganaya Base Hospital.
The warden of the elders home said the woman was in her usual happy mood that morning and even engaged in religious activities with a fellow inmate.

[APPRECIATIONS - (27-03-2017)]
Rev Father Derrick Mendis
Geniar Legend
Its four months since the demise of my very dear friend Rev Father Derrick Mendis.
My friendship with Father Derrick started in 1949, when I was admitted to St. Sebastians College, Moratuwa, as a student in the Junior Form. I was an absolute stranger from Ratnapura boarded in a relatives place in Moratuwa.
Derricks genial face attracted me and with his characteristic smile; he made me feel at home. We immediately got friendly and subsequently became best of friends. Sydney, another good friend, and I spent our evenings at Derricks residence. We played marbles or went catapulting, and sometimes during the weekends, we went river bathing.
We finished our SSC at St Sebastians in 1952, and Derrick, whom we fondly called Dicky, proceeded for further studies to St. Josephs College, Colombo. Our friendship did not end there.
During the holidays, we met and went on cycle trips to Wadduwa, where we had a quick drinks of toddy. By this time, Dicky had grown tall and had developed a personality and demeanor which spoke of strong leadership.
He planned cycle trips down South to Kataragama. Defying all the warnings of people who cautioned us not to go through jungle roads, we proceeded through Ratnapura and Embilipitiya, stopping for the nights at known places and then back to Moratuwa along the coast. We had challenging experiences, but with Dicky in the fore front we had nothing to fear, and we had an enjoyable time.
Dicky was a marvelous friend who liked to entertain and help people in difficulties at all times. During the holidays, Dicky used to visit me at Ratnapura with Sydney. He had an air gun, and we went bird-shooting. Dicky loved fishing, hunting and spear fishing. Rearing fish was a hobby of his.
After our school career, we met again at Peradeniya where I was at the school of Agriculture, and he, at the university. He used to visit me at my hostel at Gannoruwa and we had a little toddy and then dinner at my hostel. Egerton used to accompany him, and all the students joined in a sing song with Dicky at the piano.
After our academic career, I went my way, and Dicky, his, in our own fields. Dicky followed a course in Chartered Accountancy.
But we met very often and corresponded with each other regularly, although I was at Ratnapura and he in Colombo. One day, he sprang a surprise on us by saying that he was going to join the Jesuit Order.
Derrick showed his magnanimity to God by deciding to use all the gifts and talents that he had endowed him with in spreading his kingdom on earth.
That was characteristic of him. After a get-together of all his old friends, he was accompanied by them to Manresa Seminary in Batticaloa. Even during his seminary life in Batticaloa, and also in Pune he managed to get in touch with his friends. Later, we met at his ordination and soon after when my marriage took place; he was our celebrant.
His first appointment was to the remote town of Balapitiya where there was a small parish church with only four Catholic families. At the start, his parish life was rather tedious as all the people roundabout were non-Catholics.
He used to lose all his belongings too. But he was not perturbed, and tactfully managed to get round the non-Catholics who eventually became his great supporters. Some of them continued their friendship till the end of his life.
The Jesuit Society, making use of his knowledge and expertise and recognizing his rapport with the youth, made him the Director of their Technical College in Batticaloa, and later, in Badulla. He never failed to visit me whenever he came down to Moratuwa.
His birthday was an occasion when all his closest friends in Moratuwa met at Auberine his home, at my place or at Wilfred Coorays place.
He loved singing, and his stentorian voice, which he himself accompanied on the piano inviting others to join him, was much in evidence at his parties. He loved small children and got them to play the tambourines and the cymbals. He sometimes played the guitar too, making it a real musical evening.
He also spiced the occasion with his humorous anecdotes. He had a large circle of friends drawn from the rich and the poor all of whom he treated alike. He also joined Surol and worked for the welfare of the leprosy patients.
He loved his sister Rev Sister Charmaine very much and also his cousin Father Egerton Perera who was with him in the University and together joined the Jesuit Society. He not only officiated at our wedding, but also attended our 25th Wedding Anniversary and was the celebrant at my sons wedding too. He rarely declined invitations to our special occasions.
Towards the latter part of his life, he was down with illness which finally incapacitated him. He was confined to a room at the Jesuit Residence at Akkara Panaha.
It was pathetic to see this mighty figure lying in bed having to depend on others which was not what he wanted, but had to accept with resignation. He never complained but managed a smile when we visited him saying What to do Lucian, these things have to be faced.
I must mention here that it was Lal and his family who were Buddhists he had met at Balapitiya who tended him with dedication coming all the way from Madampe every other day till the end of his life.
Rev Father Derrick Mendis was a legend, and the void which his demise has created can never be filled. The memories that he left behind will be evergreen in our hearts and minds.
May his soul rest in peace!
Lucian de Silva
Andrew Silva
Silent philanthropist
Having had a successful career in business, former Managing Director of Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. Andrew Silva spent this retirement as a practicing Buddhist and social worker until he passed away, peacefully, at the ripe age of 96 years, recently.
Hailing from Kottagoda, Matara, as the son of a small businessman and fourth in a family of five children who lost their mother when they were very young, he had his early education in Matara. As most other youth from the South, he also moved to Colombo and joined the Government Technical College, and later the Polytechnic, where he followed the accounting and secretarial courses. Silva was one of the early products of these two institutions.
He started his career as an Audit Clerk with a monthly wage of Rs. 15/-. This was one of the basic professions during that era in the early part of the 20th century. Having worked in the tea sector for a short period, he joined United Tractors in the early 1950s.
In the mid-1950s, he joined Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. in Colombo as an Accountant. The company subsequently became Coca-Cola Beverages Sri Lanka Ltd. Pure Beverages Co. Ltd. was formed through the acquisition of Ceylon Fruit Drinks and Table water Co. in March 1955. The company was selling Lion Brand aerated waters such as Passionola, Portello, Ginger Beer, Lanka Lime, Orange Sharona, Dry Ginger Ale, Tonic, and Soda. They had 10 Distributors island-wide. In 1958, he was instrumental in introducing the Kist range of fruit-based food products. In 1961, Pure Beverages became Sri Lankas bottler of the Coca-Cola Company following the Franchise Agreement signed with The Coca-Cola Export Corporation in 1960.
Many were the challenges faced by the company during this time, which included the Governments adoption of an import restriction policy to enhance and protect local industries. As a result, there was a shortage of white glass bottles and insufficient stocks of sugar to produce Coca-Cola. Silva resolved this issue by successfully negotiating with Ceylon Glass Company in Ratmalana to produce clear bottles and by starting the Dheegavapi sugar plantations to produce sugar. Since refrigeration facilities were needed to maintain the flavour of Coca-Cola, unlike local beverages, he arranged for the Distributors to purchase locally manufactured Sisil Refrigerators/Bottle coolers.
As a practicing Buddhist and the Managing Director of Pure Beverages, he introduced mindfulness by getting the workforce to spend a few minutes meditating prior to starting work. While promoting meditation, he demonstrated to his multinational partners, the benefits of this practice in increasing the productivity of the workforce. Silva created history in Sri Lanka by building a Buddha Shrine within the premises of a multinational organization.
In summary, it could be said that at a time when the company was not doing well, he took the helm and turned the ship around. His multifaceted experience, ability, and good work ethics uplifted the companys profile to international standards. He was an inspirational leader who guided Pure Beverages to become a leading beverage producer and distributor in Sri Lanka and a company that can be benchmarked against for best operational practices in the South Asian region.
Having come under the influence of the Most Ven. Madihe Pannasiha Mahanayaka Thera, he widened his knowledge of Buddhism and devoted his time to meditation. His silent service as a philanthropist saw a new building being constructed at the Siri Vajiranana Dharmayathanaya, Maharagama, for the benefit of those who observed sil on Poya days as well as for Dhamma talks, discussions, and meetings. He donated his personal vehicle, a Peugeot 406, to Ven. Madihe Mahanayaka Thera. He also closely associated Ven. Ampitiye Sri Rahula Nayaka Thera.
Not many of us knew of his contribution to Sri Bodhiraja Foundation in Embilipitiya until Ven. Omalpe Sobitha Thera mentioned during his anusasana at the funeral ceremony. The varied meritorious deeds he did in his lifespan ranged from developing places of worship to providing assistance to anyone through his Sang-HithaCharitable Trust. He was also a guide and mentor to those who he felt were in need of guidance.
When I joined Dharmavijaya Foundation (DVF) as a young Trustee in the early 1980s, Silva was one of the Senior Trustees. He joined other trustees to visit and monitor the progress of Dhramavijaya Societies (DVSs) located in Mahaweli areas, namely Girandurukotte, Dehiattakandiya, Welikanda, and Thambuthegama. He trained me how to lead a spiritual life. When I used to travel with him to Mahaweli areas, I vividly remember that the first thing he did as he woke up early morning was to arrange his bed neatly and lay the pillow in the correct position.
He always led a simple life, and during the latter part of his life, he changed his dress to a simple white national attire. I met him last when I visited Sri Lanka in 2014. I experienced not only his knowledge of the Dhamma, but also observed his way of living.
May he attain the Supreme Bliss of Nibbana!

W.L. BOGTSTRA
Guiding beacon
I write these words in sincere appreciation, honour, gratitude, and love about my former boss and Managing Director of Malwatte Valley Plantations Limited W.L. Bogtstra, who passed away few months ago.
I first met him through my good friend Lalith Lenadora, who was in the top management of Malwatte Valley Plantations in 2003.
I joined Malwatte Valley Plantations in January, 2004, as the manager of Aislaby Estate, Bandarawela, and was promoted to Group Manager within three months.
Many of my colleagues asked me whether I was mad to join Malwatte Valley in light of adverse publicity that circulated about the company at that time.
It did not take me long to find that the policies on agriculture, manufacture, and finance were the best I had experienced during my planting career, up to that time in the trade.
Before I assumed duties, he gave me some advice. He said, We all are managers and will have to deal with workers. Always act impartially and on facts. Think twice before you do something.
The second piece of advice was to act with a sense of fairness and dignity. Yes, you are quite right, sir. Your advice has assisted me immensely in my day to day work, even up to now.
His experience and knowledge of the plantations, and his dedicated service to the industry was unparalleled. He was an old Josephian at the beginning, and thereafter, studied in India. He was a disciplinarian, voracious reader, fine friend, a loving husband, and a good father.
Although he was very strict, was straightforward when voicing honest opinions. He never flattered anybody to be popular and offered constructive criticism where necessary.
He was a beacon guiding many prominent personalities, including several planters, but never boasted about his achievements.
Those who experienced a close association with him would know how punctual and methodical he was. He is a man of principle, and never bowed to pressure, interference, or threats.
Bogtstra was a very simple person who led a simple life.
I am beholden to place on record that his benevolent attitude and sympathetic consideration helped me recover from my ailment completely.
I had to leave the company because my illness struck me down, making it necessary to undergo a surgery, for which I did not have adequate funds. My sickness caused anxiety to my family as well, and they too, joined me to thank Bogtstra for giving us all assistance and providing me a company vehicle for nearly four months with all the perks I enjoyed while in service.
That was a great consolation and assistance to us at a time most needed.
Should someone asks me now of the  Madness in joining Malwtte Valley, I will say that it was absolutely madness not joining them earlier.
In 2011, he offered me the post of superintendent in a coconut property, but unfortunately I could not take up due to some other commitments.
Bogtstras success in managing the plantations and the company was mainly due to his son Lucas who was like a tower of strength behind him.
I thank God for giving me a such a good kind-hearted boss whom I badly miss and find it difficult to believe that he is no more.
May the good Lord Bless and keep you in his divine home in heaven.
Sir, till we meet again, I remain.
The one who died to save you will never be against you.
May your soul rest in peace!

Venetia Gamage
Lady who made others smile
I slept, and dreamed that life was beauty;
I woke, and found that life was duty. Echoing the words of American poet Ellen Sturgis Hooper (1812-1848), Venetia Gamage ne Fernando wrote these 2 lines in my autograph-book 56 years ago, as a virtual testament to her life, lived in service to others.
Hence, it is indeed, a privilege to pen this very brief eulogy to one who was not only a renowned Girl Guides Commissioner, educationist, and social worker, but also a mentor, confidant, and
kalyana mithra to all! She stands, admirably, with those who have given so freely unto strangers, as much as unto loved-ones. Diligence, devotion and discipline personified her!
Our paths crossed for the first time in 1961, whilst I was a student at Devi Balika College, Colombo: Venetia Gamage was assigned to teach us general science. I vividly recall her very first lesson: shapes of leaves. The gift of teaching, was undoubtedly hers, along with immense patience and compassion she bore towards the weakest of learners.
Always smiling from the depths of her heart, unpretentiously and compassionately, she easily won over many an individual, including myself. Her kind ways were a great boon to the students (whether her direct-pupils or not) at Devi Balika.
She who was a second mother to all at school. Unfortunately, she lost her own mother quite unexpectedly. (I remember her late mother as a most eloquent and kind lady, whom I had the privilege of meeting by chance.) Despite having suffered this tragic personal loss, Gamage strenuously resolved to prevent her grief from impeding the duties owed to her students at Devi Balika. Such was her strength-in-service to all. Though tiny in stature, she always had a huge heart!
Looking back, I cannot think of any other who influenced my life more positively than she. Being always supportive of my undertakings, Gamage did so kindly patronize and mentor me on many an occasion.
I, particularly, recall how she personally intervened to facilitate a job interview for me at Browns Group, in 1965, after she got to know how arduous it had been for me to travel to my former workplace. Her said efforts not only served to facilitate my employment thereat, but also provided me with the opportunity of meeting my (late) husband; thereby, securing me for life!
When my mother had to undergo emergency surgery, for which we were wholly unprepared, Gamage took it upon herself to volunteer her services as an able seamstress, producing several bed-jackets in just a matter of hours. 12 years later, upon having to undergo surgery myself, she was there chanting pirith for my speedy recovery.
On my daughters birth in 1969, Gamage promptly sent me a beautiful bouquet of flowers followed by her own presence, with her husband, Nihal, at hospital.
Even during my stay abroad, Gamage made it a point to frequently write me. She and her husband Nihal insisted on providing us with accommodation, at her home, during one of our visits to Sri Lanka. She was always there to receive me at the airport with her beaming smile!
Gamage always had a sixth sense for knowing her pupils troubles. Although, I did, eventually, make it a point not to burden her with my personal issues, she would, more often than not, instinctively get to know about them. In 1999, when my daughter underwent major surgery, she was there with her husband, Nihal, at hospital, just 2 days after the operation.
In fact Nihal Gamage, whom she married in 1967, embraced his wifes charitable disposition with much sincere enthusiasm. He did, without a doubt, prove himself to be her proverbial soul-mate.
Gamages commitment to the Girl Guides Movement saw her gracing the highest positions accessible to a Sri Lankan, in this regard. I was both, very proud and happy, to have her stay with us for a few days, in Singapore, when she was invited to a Girl Guides Conference held thereat in 1980.
Unsurprisingly, whatever the esteemed positions held by Gamage, her sincerely benevolent disposition never changed. Uptill her sudden demise on March 4, she remained the same humble and accommodating person I met 56 years ago.
I, truly, could write volumes about this unique and noble personality.
She adored her son, Daminda. She was a dutiful-daughter to her parents: the late Ethel and Arthur Fernando; and loving-sister to her siblings: the late Dudley, the late Ninette, and younger brother, Tilak.
Laying claim to a legacy of devoted-teaching, sincere-counseling, and compassionate-giving, Venetia Gamage, even in her terminal 81st year, strove to enrich all those whose lives she touched! Being a devout Buddhist, she led an exemplary life.
She was both, my trusted mentor and truest friend!
I am so thankful to have had her in my life!
May her journey in Samsra be short! May the blessings of the Noble Triple Gem be with her, always!

Prof. Upali Vidanapathirana
Intellect and Mentor
It was May 20, 2010; I had received a call from Vice Chancellor of the Open University of Sri Lanka(OUSL). I felt nervous and apprehensive. Nevertheless, I went to meet Prof. Vidanapathirana at his office.
Nalin, we have to do research, he said. On what area, sir I asked. On Business Process Re-engineering (BPR), at the Open University of Sri Lanka, he replied. So, we started to work with problem formulation, conceptualization, data collection, and interpretation.
Despite his busy schedule, he always found time to guide me on this. Then, we submitted the paper to the Annual Academic Session at Open University, and it was accepted. I prepared a PowerPoint presentation and emailed him with the following remarks: Dear Sir, I already prepared my PowerPoint presentation, but I feel this is your brainchild, and I will do injustice by doing that (presenting it by myself at the conference). So, your opinion please In response, I received a very short reply:
Dear Nalin, I wont gain anything by doing it. Please do it, and do a good job.

This is the kind of mentoring which I was very fortunate to receive from Prof. Vidanapathirana, Senior Professor in Economics, Department of Social Studies, Open University of Sri Lanka.
He is actually one of my role models, and this is same for many junior academics at OUSL. In our lives, especially as academics, we need mentoring. Prof. Vidanapathirana, with his capacity, helped us to develop our skills in research, and more importantly, he articulated empathy towards others.
Prof. Vidanapathirana, hailing from down south, Baddegama, is a graduate from University of Kelaniya, majored in Economics. He completed his Masters in Business Administration (MBA) from the University of Sri Jayawardenepura, and his PhD, from JNU, India.
He joined the Open University after serving in a leading public bank in Sri Lanka. Professor has served as Vice Chancellor (OUSL), as well as Dean, Faculty of Humanities and Social Sciences, with numerous publications and contributions for its existing domain of knowledge.
We extend our best wishes and blessing as he retires from his University career, leaving a rich legacy of many achievements during his tenure at the Open University.
Sri Lanka needs many intellectuals such as Prof. Vidanapathirana to convert this blessed country into a developed nation. Sri Lanka has a rich history of more than 30,000 years of civilization.

Aquatic acquaintances
Water bodies combined with plants not only make your garden attractive, they actually are an oasis in the middle of Colombo. Your own oasis in the very heart of Colombo. A place where you feel relaxed and at ease. Garden Talk speaks to Director of Deputy Provincial Agriculture Office Rathmalana, District Agriculture Instructor G.D. Udaya Kumara on Aquatic Plants
"Water plants can be divided into three. One is edible water plants for food, the other is water plant with medicinal value. Then there is the third category which is foliage water plants for attraction and beauty. Today we will examine Aquatic Foliage Plants maintained for attraction," said Udaya Kumara.
We see Aquatic Foliage plants mainly in large or small glass fish tanks. Here we create an entire environment in the water. A marine eco system on a small or large scale. We can maintain these tanks in our gardens out in the open, in a landscaping way, even creating a bed of sand at the bottom of the water tank. You can create a lovely environment in the tank.

G.D. Udaya Kumara
"Like foliage plants used in gardens for attraction, these aquatic foliage plants are maintained in water tanks for attraction. Normally the tanks contain fish, which goes well with these plants. The fish also eat these foliage plants. Because it is their environment," stated Udaya Kumara.
The plants can be specially selected according to variety and design, and these are maintained in these tanks. Even in these Aquatic foliage plants there are categories -
Floating aquatic water plants- the plant and its roots floating above the water surface. (Not connected to the sand)
A variety where half of the plant is submerged under the water and the rest is above the water. The roots are under the sand.
The other grows completely beneath (the plant and the roots are all below) the water surface, but sometimes the flower may appear above.
"There is of course a sand medium in the tanks. We can plant these plants in pots and lower them to the bottom of the tank and then nicely apply a level of sand or pebbles over the pots that have been lowered to the bottom of the tanks, so then only the plant can be seen. Then we can fill the tank with water. Or we can keep them as pots below the tank. But if you apply the sand and pebbles the quality is more. The tank can be designed this way," added Udaya Kumara
These aquatic foliage plants are exported from Sri Lanka to European countries.
"However these pots need to be changed. After some time a new pot needs to be used with the old one being taken out. This is because the root system of the plant becoming too large. And naturally these foliage plants (in the natural environment) grow large. And once these foliage plants grow too big, they lose that beauty, and so a new one has to be introduced with the old one being taken out. Also it is a small space in the tank and the medium is also small," explained Udaya Kumara.
Importing from Bangkok
We do import aquatic foliage plants because the plants - Nelum and Olu that we have in Sri Lanka cannot be used for our small tanks. This is because they have not been modified. But from Bangkok we import aquatic plants that bear small flowers. These can be accommodated in our small tanks. So in Sri Lanka there is a market for this. These too have their smell and color.
"In our country we have aquatic water plants, but in order to bear flowers they have to grow big. These plants grow in our lakes. In our small tanks we are not able to grow them because we cannot give them that environment. If we grow them in our tanks the flowers will not bloom. The environment in our small tanks is inadequate. There is no space for the plant to grow. That is why we import small aquatic plants from Bangkok. For our Sri Lankan plants to bear Olu and Nelum they have to grow big. The soil medium in our tanks is inadequate and there is no space in our small tanks. The plant is not successful. We cannot duplicate the natural environment in this small tank. Because in the natural environment there is ample space and there is seed propagation after maturity. In the natural environment there is so much space for the plant to expand. None of this is possible in a small tank. There is no proper growth and thus no maturity. The types we import from Bangkok are smaller plants that have no problem reaching maturity in small spaces. Because these are improved varieties," Udaya Kumara gave a detailed explanation.
But what we import from Bangkok can grow in small spaces. But if we are creating a bigger pond in our home garden, then maybe our local varieties can work. We have beautiful foliage plants, and they can be grown in larger water bodies.
"Also in aquatic foliage plants, there are those that are admired for their beautiful flowers and leaves. When it comes to Nelum, Manel and Olu, the flower has value - its color and smell, and then there are plants with beautiful leaves - the shape, pattern and color," pointed out Udaya Kumara
"Sometimes we use the tissue cultivation technique. Because it is illegal for us to take plants from their natural environment and export them.
Because we are losing out on our natural heritage. So we use tissue cultivation technique to grow flowers and then we import them. This is because every week we need to send a new batch. Because this is now an industry," he noted finally.

Arrogate wins Dubai Cup despite poor start
Arrogate, ridden by Mike Smith, came back from a shaky start to sprint to victory in the $10-million Dubai World Cup on Saturday, beating Gun Runner in the worlds second-richest horse race.
Trained by Bob Baffert, the odds-on favourite, made a dramatic comeback in the 2,000-metre contest after breaking from the stalls at the back of the pack.
It was like watching Seabiscuit or something. It was a Hollywood-type finish, Baffert told reporters at the 60,000-capacity Meydan racecourse.
Neolithic came third of the 14 runners in the contest, which was the worlds richest horse race until being surpassed by Floridas $12-million Pegasus World Cup earlier this year.
Smith rode off the track after the win with the Saudi flag of owner Prince Khalid bin Abdullah draped around his shoulders.
Once we got away like that and got squeezed leaving there, I had no choice but to just sit there and let him collect himself, Smith said.
When I called on him heading for home, he just took off. It was just incredible, just incredible. - Agencies

Bangladesh PMs boost to cricketers
DAMBULLA: Bangladeshs chances of winning their first-ever ODI series against Sri Lanka has been boosted by a call from the countrys Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina to the cricket team.
The Prime Minister had called, we were talking to her. After the Test win, I couldnt talk to her; she spoke to Shakib (Al Hasan) and Mushfiqur (Rahim). After we had won today, she called the board president and many of us also got to speak to her. She congratulated all of us; its a great feeling when the countrys Prime Minister wishes you well, said man of the match Tamim Iqbal after scoring a quality century that fashioned Bangladeshs 90-run win in the first ODI here on Saturday.
Winning the series is very important. We are in a position to win it. It will be a huge achievement to beat Sri Lanka in their backyard. It wont be easy, and we have to work harder in the next match, he said.
It was Tamims well-paced knock of 127 of 142 balls that laid the foundation and saw Bangladesh post their first 300-plus total against Sri Lanka and take a 1-0 lead in the 3-match series.
Getting the hundred, and winning the game is the best feeling you can ever get, said Tamim. All centuries are equal to me. It is all special. I was batting in a difficult situation because of the heat. Whenever my hundred contributes to a win, it becomes a special one.
There was a time when I was struggling a little bit in the 40s. If I had got out during that period, we wouldnt have put up such a big score. You must have seen Mashrafe (Mortaza) bhai coming outside and telling me to play long. Not everything will go according to your plan when youre playing a long innings. You go through a difficult patch but you overcome it, he said.
Tamim who has been around for long (since 2007) to see the gradual rise of Bangladesh cricket said, We struggled when we started playing international cricket, and then there was a time when we wanted to be a strong side at home. Now we are slowly progressing in overseas conditions as well. It is a great way to start an ODI series, but there are still two more games to go. We need to be at our best to beat them. They are a quality side.
We did outstandingly today in the field. Mashrafe bhais fielding effort was fantastic. We probably wont win games all the time but this attitude will make things easier. This new attitude of being involved in everything and supporting each other will take us a long way.
We have some talented youngsters with some experienced cricketers. The best feeling is when the team is winning. We also know that there will be a time when things wont go our way. We have to remember our good times and when the time comes, we will handle it better.
In the last few matches, we have played good cricket but it didnt show in the results. But it is more pleasing to win more matches. Our progress is shown in the small things that we are doing properly, said Tamim.

President of CA Sri Lanka, Lasantha Wickremasinghe said that the institute has always been at the forefront in launching landmark initiatives aimed at enhancing the knowledge of the country's student population while also offering various programmes for the development of the accounting professionals including business leaders.
He said that the contest will provide aspiring accounting professionals including future Chartered Accountants the necessary boost to help harness their knowledge and skills on pertinent subjects which are a mandatory requirement when students' progress to become professionals.
"The CA Quiz and Effective Communication Contest will be an important platform to help students develop their skills and knowledge, so that when they progress as professionals they will have the necessary knowledge, confidence and the required skills to conduct their business without hesitation," Wickremasinghe said.
He added that the contest will be an excellent platform to not only put to test the skills of the students but also help develop their communication skills in the English language.

Cadets, the leaders of tomorrow
Cadets, neatly dressed in their uniforms and heads held high, stand apart from your ordinary students at school. Their sense of adventure, preparedness, and discipline is a result of vigorous training for many years. But as exams and tuition classes take over, every minute of student life, extra-curricular activities such as cadetting have been given less importance in schools. The Cadet Training Centre in Rantambe, however, is seeking to change this trend. It is the place every cadet dreams of going every year, and it is, according to the cadet trainers, the experience that can change your life.
It is not only an adventurous trip, but also an experience which teaches you about life, said National Cadets Corps (NCC) Director Major General A.K.P Wickramasinghe, whose motto he said has been Always want to train and inspire them to be good citizens.
Maj. General
A.K.P. Wickremasinghe.
Picture by Ruwan De Silva.
The NCC is the Sri Lankan Military Cadet Corps' youth organization sponsored by the Ministry of Defence. Formally known as the Ceylon Cadet Corps, it is open to school students on voluntary basis, and has a history spanning 135 years. The officers are teachers who act as instructors, and the cadets are given basic military training in small arms and parades.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe also stressed that they imprint the importance of education on their cadets. Cadetting is an additional qualification. It is value-addition to the academic qualification they receive in schools, he said.
Commandant of the Training Centre, NCC Rantambe, Lieutenant Colonel Palitha Mendis said, there should be a healthy balance between education and cadetting. Some parents think that cadetting will spoil their childrens education, while some just want to get a certificate. The certificate will not be valid if the students have not understood the core values of cadetting, he added.
While stressing upon the importance of cadetting in a students life, Lieutenant Colonel Mendis added that it would be great if cadetting is incorporated into national policy. It will help schools maintain discipline, and those students will pass out of schools as useful and well-behaved citizens, he said.
Cadets are brought to the Cadet Training Centre after one year of training at their respective schools under a teacher who acts as the instructor.
Only a limited group is taken to the training centre. Usually, the teachers have training sessions in the morning or evening at schools, and that is not easy as the students have the habbit of going to tuition classes now, explained Lt. Colonel Mendis. He added that the school principals should also show some concern over this and ensure that the students receive quality training at school. Some schools train the students only a few days before they come for training. We see the difference when they start doing their practices here, he said.
More Cadets would be given opportunities to be trained in Rantembe
At Rantambe, discipline is instilled from day one. Cadets line up for their daily routine at the Centre, and scheduled activities are executed with great precisionone after another under the watchful eye of an instructor. This schedule given to them on their first day of arrival will remain unchanged throughout their time at the Centre. At the top of the training grounds, a big sign reads, Never be unpreparedthe NCC motto which would be drilled into the heads of the cadets time and time again by the instructors.
Lt. Colonel Mendis explained that the cadets training schedule also includes lessons on how to clean, eat, and most importantly, how to manage their time.
All the activities here are done according to a timetable. At the inauguration, the cadets will be given a sheet that clearly explain the schedule and rules that need to be followed during their stay. Teachers in charge of cadets will then take on the responsibility to continue with this practice in their respective schools, he said.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe further explained that the mission of the NCC was To train school cadets and inspire cadets using effective training curricula in order to develop character, sportsmanship, self-reliance, discipline, civic-mindedness, spirit of adventure, responsibility, and comradeship to be a valuable human resource of well-trained youth capable of providing leadership in all aspects of life.
NCCs objectives are to encourage leadership, initiative, and teamwork, enhance and promote the image of the youth, encourage them to acquire the basic concept of teamwork and other interpersonal skills in order to produce future leadership, encourage the youth and to inculcate and foster the importance of community service and responsibilities and create an opportunity to develop physically, intellectually, and socially, he said.
By the end of this year, the NCC also has three objectives to achieve in its own capacity,
The first objective is to establish new cadet platoons island-wide and conduct cadet training in National schools, MMV and MV. Second, to conduct junior cadetting in 2017 and to increase the number of cadet trainees from 27,000 to 40,000 at the Rantambe Training Centre, he said.
He further said that according to President Maithripala Sirisenas concept, initially, 500 cadet platoons would be established in 500 schools, which do not have cadetting at present.
Maj. General Wickremasinghe noted that many new subjects have been included to senior cadetting.
They are very important for the improvement and performance of the cadets. The new subjects are: leadership and management, positive thinking, personality development, first aid, regimental duties, general knowledge, disaster management, work ethics, and team building, he said.
Their plans for junior cadetting too, is ambitious, since it was restarted last year. It had been stopped for the last 35 years due to unavoidable reasons.
The subjects included for junior cadetting are physical training, squad drill, map reading, field trips, first aid, leadership, ethics and manners, confidence and team-building, bullet inspection, and concert, he said.
There are 38 battalions and 1,873 cadet Platoons island-wide. Currently, they are 5,700 schools that do not take part in Cadets, and the NCCs aim is to form cadets in every school.
According to Maj. General Wickremasinghe the students who have been cadets have very little chance of being demoralized later in life.
They get adjusted to the situation and organize themselves. We always ensure that they are well-behaved and disciplined. We correct them by rehabilitating; we do not punish them, he said.
For Lt. Colonel Mendis, cadetting is more to do with multi-skills development training,
Parents should also think about attitude-building of students along with their education. The students come here once every year for training. We cannot fully take responsibility for their overall behavior. If they misbehave within the training centre premises, the marks of those cadets will be reduced, he said.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said the cadets come to Rantambe to improve their leadership, skills but there are also exceptions who misbehave.
We all know who how children behave. They are impulsive by nature. NCC has a history of 135 years, and has produced thousands of cadets who are in a better position today, he said, We never let children misbehave here; we watch them.
A different experience for students
Cadets from all over the country gather at Rantambe grounds once every year for cadet training. Having been trained in their respective schools for about a year, the cadets come to Rantambe to polish their training through a stricter and a well-organized program.
Here, they learn to fire a gun and cross obstacle paths, train in march pasts and drills, and many more. The cadets are also awarded for their best performance at the end of the training programme.
It is only the best cadets from every school who are selected for training here. At present, 27,000 cadets are given training annually, said Maj. General Wickremasinnghe.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said the officers and cadets have no liability for active military service, but many volunteer to join the armed forces.
It is also an opportunity for the cadets from all parts of the country to mingle, as they come from different religious, social, and economic backgrounds. Whatever their background, all of them will be treated equally. This will create good understanding between the cadets, he said.
He further said that Hermann Loos Championship Trophy is awarded annually to the best performing cadet platoon from a boys' school, and the De Soysa Champion is awarded annually to the best performing cadet platoon from a girls' school.
Lt. Colonel Mendis said that under the youth action programme, Sri Lanka is also privileged to visit the SAARC countries to join their independence/victory parade. Thats a great advantage for the cadets as well as NCC.
When talking of education, the cadets also get bonus marks from the University Grants Commission, if they have received Hermann awards. Cadets in senior ranks will also be given extra marks to enter their respective colleges of education, he said.
He added that NCC cadets also annually participate in the Independence Day parade.
Cadet instructor at the Ampara Hegoda Sri Indrasaara Vidyalaya Captain L.H.K. Priyantha has 10 years of experience in training students for cadetting.
We train cadets at schools, and we are also given positions in the schools to maintain discipline. The administration also believes that we will be able to handle and control the students better, he said. He further said that the students are very much interested, and he gives them training every day after school.
The cadet instructor from Akkaraipattu Central College Lieutenant Mohamed Zifan has seven years of experience in cadet training. I am very proud to say that this is the sixth platoon that I have brought this year for training at Rantembe, said Zifan.
Earlier, people had a feeling that these children are being taken to give army training and were reluctant to send their children. Now, we have proven that to be a myth. When the parents see the transformation in their children, in discipline and behaviour, they willingly send their children, he added.
Lt. Zifan further explained that though parents think that cadet training would be a barrier to the academic process of the children, it was completely untrue.
It was a challenge for me to select 25 students from all the cadets at school to bring to Rantambe for training. When I said training, they were very excited, and all of them wanted to join. Thats the spirit, he said. He further said that the training in Rantambe was very special and important to the cadets from his school as it is a novel experience for them.
It allows them an opportunity to come out of their own village to a different place; engage with cadets from other areas and religions. When they leave home after the training, they carry only positive vibes, he said.

Child born with deformed features termed alien
Being born with rare conditions can be challenging for the survival of a child, and it only gets worse in India since the lack of awareness about medical disorders creates a situation where the infant doesnt get the sensitive treatment that it needs, and in many cases faces trouble from society.
A similar case is being reported from Bihars Katihar, where a child born with thick skin and deformed features due to Harlequin Ichthyosis is being branded an alien and also called supernatural by the locals. The child was born to 35-year-old Khalida Begum last week. She was shocked to see the small head and bulging eyes.
The child also has symptoms of Anencephaly, where the child is born without a head. The shocked mother initially refused to even nurse the child, but started nursing it after a while.
She told Daily Mail, I was so shocked and saddened by this that I asked the midwife to take the baby out of my sight.
Meanwhile villagers are thronging to the house to catch a glimpse of the child. Everyone is calling the child an incarnation of Lord Hanuman. This isnt a first as several children with certain birth defects have been associated with supernatural beings due to lack of awareness.

Water Board in need of equipment
It was around 10.00 p.m. when I was walking down Jetawana Road on my way home to Layards Broadway, I noticed water oozing out from the payment which had been renovated recently by interlocking bricks. When I reached home, I called 1939 and made a complain regarding the above leak specifying the location. I received an acknowledgement instantaneously through SMS to my hand phone 
Your complaint submitted to the relevant officer for action. Please call 0777 708410 for any inquiry, quote ref. no. 490523. Thank you! NWSDB
The exact location of the leak is on the pavement adjoining the showroom marketing electrical items belonging to an upmarket vehicle importing prestigious Company (Diesel & Motor Engineering Company Ltd.) which is opposite the Isurudisi building and the Jetawana Temple.
The following day after the early morning prayer at Al Mahadul Bukhariyul Kadirie Thakiya mosque 178, Layards Broadway, Colombo 14, I was surprised to see water leaking through the pavement very close to the entrance to the above mosque. When I enquired from the caretaker of the mosque, he told me that in response to his complain, the Water Board workers had visited the place but have left without attending to the necessary repairs and the excuse was that they do not have the required equipments!
It is ironical when Water Day is being celebrated, the above leaks have not been attended to as at today.
To keep water leaking without attending to it - is this the Water Boards way to mark Water Day 2017

Clinical Giroud earns France 3-1 win in Luxembourg
LUXEMBOURG, Saturday - Olivier Giroud struck twice as France stayed top of World Cup qualifying Group A with an efficient 3-1 victory in Luxembourg on Saturday.
Giroud, who has started only seven Premier League games for Arsenal this season, found the back of the net in each half and Antoine Griezmann scored a penalty after Aurelien Joachim had equalised for the hosts.
Didier Deschamps's side, who looked shaky in defence, now have 13 points from five games, three ahead of Sweden who beat Belarus 4-0.
France take on Spain in a friendly at the Stade de France on Tuesday before resuming their World Cup qualifying campaign with a trip to Sweden on June 9.
Griezmann found Djibril Sidibe on the right flank and striker Giroud latched on to the Monaco full back's pass to put Les Bleus ahead after 28 minutes with his 22nd international goal. Luxembourg, however, reacted swiftly and Joachim converted a penalty in the 34th minute after Blaise Matuidi had brought down Daniel Da Mota.
France were clearly the superior side, however, and Griezmann put the visitors back in front three minutes later with a penalty after Sidibe was fouled by Da Mota.
France went close to a third goal when Matuidi's half-volley from 20 metres crashed against the post.
The Euro 2016 runners-up lost Sidibe when he was carried off the pitch on a stretcher with a rib injury.
The third goal came in the 77th minute when Giroud headed home a cross by Benjamin Mendy, who was making his international debut after an impressive season with Monaco.
His club team mate Kylian Mbappe, 18, earned his first cap when he replaced Dimitri Payet in the 78th minute. The forward came close to adding a fourth with a fine half-volley that was parried by Schon. - Agencies

Customs duty concession extended to expat workers
The government has decided to further extend the Customs duty concession granted to Sri Lankan expatriate workers on their return to the country, said Customs Deputy Director Parakrama Basnayake.
He said earlier expatriate workers were granted a Customs duty concession to purchase goods to the value of USD 1,500. But now in its place, expatriate workers returning after a one-year stint would be allowed to bring in a long list of goods without any Customs duty. This includes a bathroom equipment set, bedroom furniture set, solar energy panel, computer, laptop, printer, two mobile phones, motorcycle below 350 CC engine capacity, scooter and 55-inch TV set.
Basnayake said earlier, they were allowed to bring 45-inch TV sets and one mobile phone only.
However, he would advise expatriate workers to desist from bringing air conditioners, deep freezers and TVs with screens over 55 inches.
A worker should complete at least a one-year stint abroad to qualify for this concession.

Cyclone Debbie: More than 3,500 evacuate in Queensland, Australia

More than 3,500 Australian residents have been evacuated as a cyclone carrying winds up to 240km/h (150 mph) moves towards the Queensland coast.
Cyclone Debbie is expected to intensify into a Category 4 system before it arrives early on Tuesday local time.
Some people have refused to leave despite warnings the destructive core could be as wide as 100km (62 miles).
Queensland Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk said the storm would rival the devastatingCyclone Yasiin 2011.
"This window of opportunity to leave is drastically closing," she told a press conference on Monday.
"I am just pleading to everyone, please, listen to authorities. I do, you must as well. This is about your safety, it is about the safety of your family and the safety of your children.''
A state on edge
The cyclone is expected to make landfall sometime after 07:00 on Tuesday (22:00 GMT Monday) anywhere in a 265km zone from Townsville to Proserpine.
"That is the uncertainty of cyclones," said Bureau of Meteorology regional director Bruce Gunn.
Gunn warned the cyclone could hit the coast at high tide, bringing waves up to 8m and flooding for low-lying areas.
The Whitsunday holiday islands were already being buffeted by 100km/h winds, he said.
Police Commissioner Ian Stewart said the weather was also responsible for a fatal car crash, believed to involve a tourist.
Palaszczuk said a further 2,000 residents on Monday were expected to join thousands of people who had already been evacuated from the affected area.
Stewart urged people to leave safely before it was too late.
"At some time later today, the weather event in that area, in the warning area, will get to an extent where all emergency services will not be able to respond to calls for assistance, because obviously, we have got to maintain the safety of our staff," he said.
Queensland authorities have closed 102 schools, 81 early childhood education centres and two ports.

Displaying decorum at a business forum
Business meetings are an integral part of all corporate enterprises and partnerships. Your first priority is to get to the conference on time. You will not encounter much of a problem if the engagement is in the same office you occupy. But for an out-of-the-office meeting, arrive at the venue at least ten minutes ahead of the scheduled time. For in-house meetings, make sure you turn up at least about five minutes ahead.
The early-bird approach gives you time to get nicely settled and relaxed and prepared for any eventuality.
It is vital that you remain calm and unperturbed when the meeting begins and not all flustered and harried because you just cut your arrival too fine and rushed in.
Stay attentive
Essentially for any meeting or discussion you have to be prepared and unhurried. When requested to attend a meeting, make certain you know every possible detail about it.
Reassess the agenda and work out what would be expected of you and what you should contribute beyond simply attending. In other words, take a proactive, leadership role by always learning exactly what is going to happen at a meeting. Never try to guess the reason especially for a hastily summoned emergency meeting. Ensure you are as well-informed as possible. A wrong assumption on your part could leave you clueless and totally ill-equipped to play the role of an effective participant.
Your behaviour at meetings will be observed by your peers and superiors so dont overstep the bounds of common courtesy. It is common to observe people while attending forums resorting to what is tantamount to boorish behaviour. These include viewing emails, texting, holding side conversations, and plainly not paying attention to the discussions. Learn to respect the chair and listen attentively to the participants expressing their views.
In the event you have sufficient time to make plans remember to organise your materials. A good idea would be to set up a temporary file or location to systematise and set aside all information needed for the particular meeting. Make sure you include a pen and pad.
Always make certain you adhere to the proper seating arrangements. At most formal meetings the seating may be designated. Dont just barge in to a conference room and plunk yourself in the first seat that takes your fancy. Usually a secretary or co-ordinator will usher you to your selected seat. In the event there is no usher and you are unsure simply ask the Chair where you should sit.
At most meetings the chair sits at the head of a long rectangular table, with the participants on either side. The most senior partner or guest speaker sits to the right of the chair. Always remain focused while the meeting is in progress. At times it is easy to get sidetracked. Make certain that nothing distracts your attention from the discussions at hand. You must stay attentive and take in the flow of the agenda and talks.
A heated debate
If your mind begins to wander you may suddenly find yourself caught on the wrong foot, so to say. You never know when you may be called upon to express an opinion or an estimation of the practicality of a project that comes within your purview. As such, avoid holding side conversations or comments to the person next to you and pay your undivided attention to the meeting.
Never forget the fact that you are a team player and that is the primary reason you have been requested to attend the discussions. For instance, the group may vote or go with a decision that may be contrary to your opinion. Once a decision has been made despite your diverging view make sure that you throw your weight behind the programme.
Never express recriminations after a decision has been finalised. And never complain about subjects discussed, or against specific people at the meeting. Any grievances should be aired with the chair, or perhaps with the specific individual who concerns you.
There are other meeting etiquette tips that should be adhered to even when the discussions may turn into a heated debate. Always keep your cool and an open mind to all ideas and comments shared. Never, ever attack a proposal or suggestion by saying things such as, Thats a silly idea or, That is totally impractical and will never work.
Another significant factor especially at higher level meetings is not to sound off too pompously. Protocol demands that you should first allow more senior level individuals to make their initial contributions before you begin holding forth. If you think your superior has missed a vital point in his address you could always dash off a hurried note reminding him of it and have it slipped to him.
Never interrupt
When it comes to your turn to address the gathering do not get carried away with your own verbosity and go on and on. Simply get to the point and end your comments as fast as possible, unless you are asked to elaborate on certain issues. In the event you arrive late for a discussion, quietly take a seat. But make certain you express your apology at the next appropriate break.
Never interrupt a speaker while he is holding forth. That would be considered downright churlish and rude. Allow the other person to finish his or her comments before you chime in. It would be appropriate to raise your hand to be acknowledged by the chair before speaking, if the meeting is a formal one.
Convention demands that you address all comments to the chair, even when responding to someone elses comment, unless doing so is an acceptable practice within that group culture. Never make a fool of yourself in an endeavour to impress the other participants. Stick to this age-old adage and you will be safe: "Better to remain silent and be thought a fool than to speak out and remove all doubt."
Being an appreciated participant of any meeting requires you to be aware and adaptable to the many prevailing nuances, styles, and cultures. At the first meeting, it would be wise to remain silent until you are sure that when you choose to speak, your words will be well received.
As another old political saying goes, What happens in the Cabinet, stays in the Cabinet. This means it would be improper to share meeting information with all and sundry. Bear in mind that all discussions and information are confidential, unless otherwise stated. When in doubt, ask the chair.
Always keep your cool. Dont take things personally or take offence at adverse comments. Remain calm and composed. Never raise your voice. Always speak clearly and concisely in a professional, low and even manner of voice and tone.

Fast lane to success
Judging by all accounts, the recent priority bus lane experiment on the Rajagiriya-Borella stretch has become a success. There was traffic chaos on the first day as the other drivers faced a steep learning curve but thereafter the experiment has showed benefits for all road users.
Sri Lanka is late to the bus lane party. Many other countries, even developing ones, dedicate a separate lane for buses at least during the rush hours. This streamlines the flow of buses and also allows other traffic to move without being hindered by buses which usually hog all lanes. The transport authorities, Traffic Police and the traffic experts at the University of Moratuwa must be commended for this initiative which is supported by Korean experts who have implemented a similar system in Seoul.
Before we dwell further on this subject, consider this statistic  on an average weekday, one million people enter Colombo by 30,000 buses. An equal number of people use more than 500,000 vehicles to enter Colombo daily. The disparity is immediately clear - most private vehicles have only one or two occupants. This is an almost criminal wastage of fuel and money, not counting the effects on the environment. The result is chronic traffic congestion, as all types of vehicles battle for limited road space.
Thus the bus lane experiment has several objectives. One is reducing traffic congestion and speeding up bus traffic. This gives workers an opportunity to go to their workplaces on time. The other, even more important factor is that it should encourage motorists to give up their cars and use public transport. If a bus can reach Colombo from Malabe in say, 45 minutes, why use 45 more minutes to go the same distance
But more changes are necessary before public transport can entice more passengers. The buses should be more comfortable, with more disciplined and courteous crews. Private bus drivers are notorious for reckless driving and along with three wheeler drivers, take the top spot for accidents. If these traits can be corrected, more people will opt to take the bus. The other option is to have a Mass Rapid Transit (MRT) system  in fact, the Government is already looking at building a Light Rail Transit (LRT) system for Colombo.
There is no doubt that depending on the success of this pilot bus lane project, it would be extended to other major arterial roads and also to office and school vans. The next step is to convert this to a Bus Rapid Transit (BRT) system, where buses can actually use the left lane of the opposing side of the road to pick up and drop passengers at centre island bus halts. It is essentially a train system without the trains, with all infrastructure such as terminals and stations, gates, sidewalks, warning and direction signs, and pedestrian crossing facilities. Other countries in the region are already leapfrogging into the BRT era  for example, Manila will have a BRT by 2022.
Lest we forget, Colombo already had a BRT system a long time ago  (from 1900 to 1960)  the all electric tram line. The killing off of the tram network in Colombo was one of the most imprudent decisions ever made.
This is also the time to examine the usefulness of some of the uniflow roads in Colombo, which have added unnecessary detours to most commutes. For example, the Maradana-Technical Junction uniflow makes absolutely no sense, as it puts all traffic going out of Colombo on one narrow road. A similar situation can be experienced on the Vilasitha Nivasa-Kirulapone-Pamankada stretch during rush hours. Bus passengers are severely inconvenienced, as they sometimes have to get off almost one kilometre away from their intended address. One alternative is to allow buses to ply against the traffic on uniflow streets, but this calls for far greater discipline among drivers of all vehicles.
The authorities should also consider marking High Occupancy Vehicle (HOV) lanes to allow only those vehicles with two or more passengers to use the fast lane during the morning and evening rush hour. Many countries have HOV lanes and single occupant vehicles (i.e. only the driver) are not allowed to use this lane. Those who violate this rule are fined heavily. The authorities should encourage carpooling through such measures and ride ailing services such as Uber also make it easy to find a partner for ones morning drive to work. Some countries impose a heavy surcharge on single occupant vehicles entering the busiest part of the main cities during weekdays.
Developing public transport is essential if we are keen on reducing traffic congestion. Exports have already expressed fears that traffic could crawl to just 3 Km/h on roads leading to Colombo in a few years at present vehicle registration rates. Everyone aspires to buy a vehicle because public transport options are limited and inconvenient. If we have more comfortable, safer, punctual and cleaner public transport options, more people will keep their cars at home on weekdays, making a ride into Colombo a breeze.

Federer, Wawrinka advance in Miami open
MIAMI: Roger Federer survived a brave challenge from American qualifier Frances Tiafoe before emerging with a 7-6 (7/2) 6-3 victory as he got his Miami Open title bid underway on Saturday.
Tiafoe, ranked 101st in the world, struggled against Federer's serve but was strong on his own and forced a first set tie-break in which the Swiss came out on top.
The 19-year-old son of immigrants from Sierra Leone then broke Federer's serve in the first game of the second set only for the 18-times Grand Slam winner to break back twice and run out a comfortable winner in the end.
Federer was full of praise for his opponent and said he would have gained valuable experience from the contest.
I hope he's going to learn a lot from a match like this just because playing on a centre court with a lot of people, under pressure, saving break points, making break points, playing breakers.
That's what it's about, and it should feed a player like him with a lot of energy moving forward, he said.
Federer is in fine form having clinched the Australian Open and Indian Wells so far this year and extended his record to 14-1.
The 35-year-old is looking for his third Miami title following wins in 2005 and 2006.
Federer should have met Del Potro in Miami last year but the Swiss had to pull out with an illness and he says he is looking forward to renewing his rivalry with the South American We've had some epic matches against each other: Semis at the French, Olympic semis, finals at the US Open. You name it, we've had some really good ones, he said.
Reigning US Open champion Stan Wawrinka got off to a solid start, beating Argentina's Horacio Zeballos 6-3, 6-4 at Crandon Park on Saturday.
In the absence of Andy Murray and Novak Djokovic, the top two ranked players in the world, Wawrinka is the number one seed and is fired up after reaching the final at Indian Wells last week, where he was beaten by Federer.
I'm playing better tennis. I feel that I'm playing good here. I took the confidence from Indian Wells. So let's see... When I'm playing well, when I am confident with my game, I know I can beat anybody, said Wawrinka, who turns 32 on Tuesday. It has been quite tough conditions these last few days here. Raining, really windy today. It's really windy on the court, so it's never easy.
I'm happy the way I was moving, the way I was playing, and my attitude in general was really positive, added Wawrinka, who next faces Tunisia's Malek Jaziri, a 6-3, 4-6, 6-3 winner over Spain's Feliciano Lopez. Wawrinka will face either Malek Jaziri next after the Tunisian beat Feliciano Lopez 6-3, 4-6, 6-3. -AFP

Flares up fast, cools down faster...
On the field, he is known for his grip on the game. However one of the greatest test match bowlers of our times, Muttiah Muralitharan, has stumped us with his grip on matters off the field too. Little did we know that he makes an ace businessman as well. Take it from his wife, Madhimalar Ramamurthy, Murali leaves no stone unturned when it comes to his latest quest, the countrys first aluminum manufacturing plant. The company is now a year old but keeps him on his toes. However cricket and Murali can never be kept far apart. He is very much a family man too.
Murali in a nutshell
I think Murali is a very humble person. He is extremely dedicated as well. He is very passionate about his work. I believe that humble and dedicated are the two words which describe him the most.
An alternative profession for Murali
If he had not become a famous cricketer I think Murali would have made a great businessman. He has great business skills. We now own a factory in Horana. He runs it. We manufacture aluminum cans. I was surprised to realize that he is very smart in the business. He built it up from scratch, from organizing funds to getting the land details together. He comes from a non commercial background and the way that he has handled matters is fantastic.
Greatest strength and weakness
His passion for his work is his greatest strength. His greatest weakness is his short temper! He gets angry with the drop of a hat but cools down in the same manner.
The family man
Murali is a very good father. That automatically makes him a good husband as well. He is very mature. That sort of translates in the way he handles problems. This makes things easy to handle in a relationship. When I flare up he is calm. It is the same the other way round. When he gets annoyed at something I manage to keep cool.
If we have a disagreement about a matter like how we handle the kids, the first thing we do is not to talk about the matter in front of them. We have our own private discussion before we come to a decision. Then we inform the kids about the decision. However if the disagreement is about other matters like finance or travelling, and there is no other choice, then we just agree and go with it.
These days Muralis time is taken up by our factory. Once or twice a month we visit a restaurant. My son, Naren, loves to eating out. If Murali has some free time we take the kids out to a play area.
Romance
Romance and Murali are two poles apart. We celebrated out 12th wedding anniversary on March 21. Even then nothing romantic was between us. We are eight years apart. He did not bring me a flower or anything - probably because of his maturity.
We met each other for the first time for about 10 to 15 minutes in South India. It was an arranged marriage. I come from a family of doctors and I had no clue as to how a cricketer lives his life. One of the first words Murali told me was that he practically lives in a suitcase. I was baffled by the term. But once I got married to him I realized what he meant. He had to be away every month to take part in matches. I think it was Muralis frankness and his caring nature towards his family and friends which captivated me. He brought everything out onto the table. I guess what made me say yes to him was the right time, the right people, the right person and being at the right place!
When I am with the children and I need something to be done, he is always there to help me. I think that is very important when a person becomes a mother. When I need help Murali is always hands on with the children. He has always been supportive of me wherever I go.
Foodwise
Murali loves his rice and curry. He is not into red meat much. He likes certain seafood items like fish. He is not a fan of crabs and prawns. His favourite food out of the dishes I cook is the South Indian chicken curry.
One change...
Nothing! His strengths are more than his weakness so I would not like to make any alterations in Murali.
Murali is particular about...
He is very specific about his workouts. He would always be consistent. He takes care of himself and he would suggest that to our children as well because it is essential for us to take care of our health in the long run.
Murali goes for a five kilometer run in the Parliament Grounds every morning. Now he is done doing strength training. So no more gym for him. When he was with the team they had an extensive workout pattern which demanded cardio exercises and flow workouts. Now he is only doing cardio workouts.
Holidaying
Holiday usually means going to India for the IPL in April. I get to spend 30 days with my parents and family in Chennai. The children get to meet their cousins, explore the city and taste some Indian food. If Murali is coaching abroad I would either join him there for around five days and come back or if the kids accompany me, it will be a longer stay.
Temperwise
I think a lot of little things annoy Murali. He flares up fast but luckily he also has the ability to cool down fast. I dont get annoyed fast but when I do, it usually takes time for me to regain myself. He does not like to be disturbed when he is on a business call. Naren is quite enthusiastic about cricket and plays in the under 13 team. So he is always asking all sort of questions about the game from Murali and if Murali is on the phone then that really gets to him.
Best present
He once bought me a Cartier watch during one of his tours. I had to stay behind then because Naren was too small to travel. I was quite taken surprise when he gave me that gift.
He has less patience for things like shopping, so I always go on my own shopping sprees. He also finds it difficult to engage in such activities in public places for a long span because of the fans.
Fanatic fans
Sri Lankan fans respect our privacy. They would come and say things like Aiya, can I take a picture with you after you finish your dinner. But in other Asian countries like Pakistan and Bangladesh the situation is so not like that. That is because they think cricketers are Gods. I think for them to even think like that is a great honour for a person. Our daughter, Krisha, was puzzled once about why everyone was taking photos of Murali at the airport in Bangladesh. I had to explain the matter to her and she said that she too wants to be a cricketer when she grows up so that everybody will want to take photos of her!
Favourite past times
We love watching movies together. Films starring the Superstar Rajinikanth are our all time favourites.
Three lesser known facts
1) Murali is not very bothered about his appearance. He likes to be laid back. If you call him for an interview, he would come in his track pants. If you call him for a national interview on TV - track pants again - unless the person informs him what to wear and come. Once I told him Murali, you will be on TV! Then he said They would capture my visuals from the bust upwards, right Clothing and Murali do not blend together at all. He goes for blue coloured clothes but I have forced him to wear maroons as well because I think that goes well with his skin colour.
2) Murali is very close to his family and helps them out always. He prioritizes a lot on his three brothers. He is close to his 1996 World Cup winning team and ex-cricketers like Mahela and Sanga. He is also into charity big time. I truly believe that Murali is a great man because it is not always that you come across people who are willing to help people, instantly.
3) Murali loves to do things by himself. He always drives his car and does the grocery. Once another customer came up to him at the store and exclaimed I cant believe that you are actually carrying all the vegetables! So I eat those vegetables and it is okay for me to carry them because they are for my family, Murali replied.

It wouldnt be a stretch to assume that the secret to beautiful hair and nails is to visit the salon regularly.
But experts have revealed that you can eat yourself beautiful if you include certain foods in your diet.
From Greek yoghurt for preventing wrinkles to cheese for a glossy mane, these are the foods we should all be eating to look our best.
HAIR
Cheese - Encourages growth: Cheese is rich in nutrients that promote the growth of long and healthy hair, according to research by Beautyflash.co.uk, who put together the list of foods with amazing beauty benefits.
Oysters - Strengthens and thickens hair: A lack of zinc is said to weaken the protein structure which makes up hair follicles. Therefore, eating foods rich in zinc, such as oysters, will help strengthen follicles and encourage thicker, healthier hair.
Strengthens and prevents hair loss: The protein found in poultry strengthens hair and encourages growth. When you dont get enough protein in your diet, your body allegedly rations the protein is does contain which could damage your hair, potentially causing hair loss.
Salmon - Encourages shine and growth: Salmon is full of Omega-3 fatty acids which feed the oil glands around hair follicles, giving hair a better shine. The acids also have anti-inflammatory properties to help open the hair follicles and encourage healthy growth.
Spinach - Prevents hair breakage: Spinach is full of nutrients including vitamin A, C, iron and beta carotene. These help keep your scalp and hair healthy and moisturised, which will prevent breakages.

SKIN
Soy beans - Encourages more even skin tone: Soy beans contain many beneficial minerals, and are high in protein. Combined, it means soy beans are a great food for reducing blemishes, getting a clearer complexion, and a more even skin tone.
Kidney beans - Reduces the appearance of blemishes and acne: Kidney beans are high in zinc, which contains a number of healing properties. Many studies have found a strong correlation between low zinc levels and skin blemishes, while it has been suggested that zinc can be as effective as antibiotics for reducing acne - though there is limited evidence for this.
Avocado - Moisturises skin: Avocados are full of healthy fats which help keep your skin moisturised. Healthy fats have also been shown to protect skin from sun damage.
Greek yoghurt - Prevents wrinkles: Greek yoghurt is said to have huge benefits for the skin, such as helping it to become firmer and more resistant to lines and wrinkles.
Olive oil - Reduces inflammation and puffy skin: Olive oil contains antioxidants which can help reduce inflammation or puffiness in the skin. The benefit can be obtained through consuming olive oil in the diet or applying it straight on the skin - particularly on any very dry areas.

TEETH
Green tea  Reduces plaque: Studies have found that green tea can be extremely beneficial to dental health, through reducing plaque, lowering the acidity of saliva, and controlling bacteria levels. Its believed that if you drink green tea youre less likely to suffer from gum disease and tooth decay.
Cheese  Lowers acid levels and reduces the risk of tooth decay: Cheese is an incredible source of calcium, which is one of the most important nutrients for strong, healthy teeth. It has also been suggested that eating cheese raises the pH in your mouth, reducing the risk of tooth decay.
Strawberries  Whitens teeth: Strawberries contain a natural cleanser called malic acid, which is an enamel whitener.
Celery  Cleaner teeth and fresher breath: Celery is great for your oral health, as it requires a lot of chewing which stimulates the production of saliva. This saliva neutralises the bacteria in the mouth.
Cashews  Reduces tooth decay: Cashew nuts are high in magnesium content, which helps promote healthy bones and teeth. They are also beneficial as they contain microbe-fighting properties which protect against the bacteria that contributes to tooth decay.

NAILS
Mackerel  Strengthens and moisturises the nails: When youre suffering from dry or brittle nails, upping your intake of essential fatty acids is an easy way to reverse these effects.
Chia seeds  Strengthens and encourages growth: Chia seeds are packed full of health benefits, such as being a great source of calcium, protein and magnesium. These nutrients are said to support collagen production in the body.
Pumpkin seeds  Strengthens and encourages growth: Pumpkin seeds offer a myriad of benefits, and supporting nail health is one. With high levels of protein, zinc and iron, these seeds contain all the key elements your nails need for strong and healthy growth.
Broccoli  Strengthens the nails: If youre upping your intake of protein to encourage nail growth, broccoli is the perfect accompaniment, as it enhances the benefits of protein with the aid of an amino acid called cysteine, its said.
Raw cacao  Strengthens and encourages growth: Raw cacao is full of nutrients which help benefit nail health. These include magnesium, iron, zinc and calcium.

Government assume they can rule  only with FCID, CID, PD: MR
The government assume that they can rule the country only with the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), Criminal Investigation Department (CID), and Prisons Department (PD), former President and Kurunegala district parliamentarian Mahinda Rajapaksa said.
He was addressing a Joint Opposition rally Peraliyaka, Erabuma in Habaraduwa, Galle on Saturday.
Today the law is enforced to the rulers tune. MP Wimal Weerawansa is in remand without bail. What does the government expect from such exercises They believe that they can rule the country by jailing all opponents, Rajapaksa said.
He said both leaders are responsible for this situation and one is in parliament, while the other is steering from overseas. He said that he had been a president of the country and he never said that he was not aware of things happened in the country.
I never stated that I came to know about certain happenings from the newspapers. If anyone is trying to dodge the responsibilities on affairs of the country due to his unawareness of such incidents, we do not believe such excuses. The Executive Presidency is offered to execute the executive powers, former President said.
He said the Executive President and an Executive Prime Minister would be disastrous to the country and either the President or the Prime Minister should work for the country. At present both do nothing, he said. I hold both responsible for the present situation of the country and in general, the whole government is answerable for contemporary problems of the country, Rajapaksa said.
We should not isolate Wimal Weerawansa at this juncture. If we evade our obligation and duty, no one would stand for us when a need arises. We all should stand against the governments suppression, he said.
Rajapaksa urged the media to speak and write against such unfair activities and added that the media is threatened now. The media should not get discouraged by threats. If the media does not accomplish their duties, no one will come forward for their rescue, he said.
He said the government does not hold elections on time and challenged the government to dissolve the Provincial Councils and hold elections in the South if they can.
The government is speaking about the loans for the Hambantota Port. They say they have to repay Rs. 155 billion. Now the oil prices have come down globally. The government is earning Rs. 6,000 billion from oil. Why they do not give the benefits of the reduction to the people. They can settle the loans from those earnings. They did not launch a single development project other than schemes carried out during our rule A section of parliamentarians have obtained ministerial portfolios and enjoying perks of them, the former President said. Former President commended Galle district parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirana and Southern Provincial Councillor Isuru Dodangoda for their courage.
Today all forces against the government have united. Minority communities have justifiable grievances. They were also deceived. Now they have understood it, Rajapaksa said.
Colombo district parliamentarian and JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardena, Galle district parliamentarian Dr. Ramesh Pathirane, New Left Front Leader and Ratnapura district MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara, and Lanka Samasamaja Party leader Tissa Witharana spoke.
Galu Korale Chief Sanghanayaka Baddegama Devarakkitha took part in the rally. Former minister Basil Rajapaksa, Former Speaker and parliamentarian Chamal Rajapaksa were present.

Government sources said all information on the Hambantota Port and Industrial Zone would be presented to Parliament and even facilitate a special debate if necessary.
A UNP senior minister said all development projects of the Government are done within the stipulated legal frame work. He said the government do not have any intention to hide anything unlike the previous administration did.
The preliminary agreement on Chinese involvement in Hambantota development had been made in 2012, and the agreements for marine economy, port development and industrial zone were signed during the visit of Chinese President Xi Jinping in Sri Lanka in May 2014.
Information on any of these projects was not revealed to Parliament or the people, despite repeated requests by the UNP and other parties in the Opposition. This trend was reversed in the post January 8 period, and the practice of keeping Parliament informed on all critical matters affecting the country commenced since then, the senior minister said.

How much is real in Earthly Powers Maybe everything and nothing
Anthony Burgesss take on Hemingway as a drunk boor rings true, and his narrator may have something in common with Somerset Maugham  but does any of this matter
Sam Jordison
At one point in Anthony Burgesss Earthly Powers, his author-narrator Kenneth Toomey is unable to talk because his mouth is bloated after the kicking he has received from homophobic sailors in Nice. He is then told off by a policeman: Fiction, pronounced the sergeant, is written from the imagination, it is invention, it requires no meddling with the dangerous exterior world.
With his frequent smashing of the fourth wall, Toomey seems be keen to make us aware that he is as artificial as everything else in the book, but Burgess the author also makes sure we know he is based on someone real, not invention. Many have pointed out that Toomey has a lot in common with Somerset Maugham: both homosexual, both interested in colonial Malaya, both wealthy playwrights. And Toomey is all too aware that he is not a first-rate writer and may actually be, to use the apocryphal phrase that is always applied to Maugham (but which, funnily enough, has never been satisfactorily attributed), a first-rate writer of the second rank.
Earthly Powers
Its also possible to see smidgeons of Evelyn Waugh in Toomey, as well as lashings of another never-quite-critically-acclaimed-enough author: Burgess himself. Like Toomey, Burgess had run-ins with the authorities in Malta, lived in self-imposed exile from dreary cold old England, relocated to New York and Malaya, and didnt quite make a go of writing screenplays in Hollywood. Like Toomey, Burgess had fervently Catholic family members and was rather more wavering in his own faith.
Arguably, such coincidences of biography dont matter. It would be a mistake to think that Toomey speaks either for Maugham or his creator. But knowing that many of the things Toomey mentions have real-world counterparts does give Earthly Powers a sense of solidity, as does his frequent witnessing of well-known people and events.
When we read Toomeys accounts of Spanish flu after the first world war, of mob killings in 1920s Chicago, and of the horrors of Nazi Germany, we cant help but measure them up against what we know. When Toomey naively grants an interview to the Nazi press, we cant help but think that his fictional failings feel all too real.
Clever double game
The Hemingway who comes barrelling into Scribners office looking for a lousy bastard who insulted his cojones is recognisably the drunk boor of legend. Cary Grant, apparently was as stingy as hell, in real life as well as this novel. We all know more than wed like to about the Goebbels who appears in the novel, with his Rhineland accent, his painful awareness of his failures as a playwright (which he blamed on the Jews) and his boring, nasty speechmaking.
Yet Burgess is  as usual  playing a clever double game here. As well as giving us that kick of recognition, he frequently boots the chair out from under us. As Toomey has warned us right from the start, his memory is fallible: In two ways I was not to be trusted: I was an old man, I was a writer. The act of remembering, he frequently reminds us, is also an act of creation, something akin to fiction writing: We are condemned to invent so much of the past.
Fascinating
So it is that, while many of the events and facts in the novel have real-world counterparts, many of them are deliberately incorrect or entirely fictional. Many of the writers he describes are real, but Toomeys favourite isnt. He writes: The reader will at least know of Jakob Strehler, since he was awarded the 1935 Nobel prize for literature ... Yet how can we The Nobel prize for literature was not issued that year. There are dozens, probably hundreds, maybe even thousands of similar inventions in the book, as well as misremembered dates, impossible meetings and inaccurate descriptions.
This uncertainty is fascinating in and of itself, but also feeds into the novels central themes of religion and belief. Just as Toomey must decide how much faith he can put in the Catholic church, so we as readers are left wondering about the boundaries between reality and fiction, and what we can and cant take for truth in the real world.
So we are left wondering how anyone can pronounce with any authority on the natural and the supernatural, the verifiable and the impossible. Who is Kenneth Toomey to say what is real, after all And who are we, who read him

Husband stabs wife to death over mobile phone password
An altercation between a husband and wife over a password of a mobile phone cost the life of the wife with the husband ending up in hospital struggling between life and death.
Renuka Malkanthi (39) of Dapiligoda, Agalawatta, a mother of a 12-year-old daughter was an astrologer by profession and had lived happily with her husband for the past 13 years.
March 23 was just another usual day for them. Malkanthis husband, who was getting ready to attend a neighbours funeral, had taken the wifes mobile phone to speak to a friend and found difficulty in operating it since the wife had entered a pass word.
When the husband inquired about the password, she had retorted angrily and this had led to a scuffle between the couple.
The irate husband had seized a knife and stabbed Malkanthi on three places killing her. The husband repenting over his action taken on sudden provocation thought of ending his own life and gulped down a bottle of weedicide to commit suicide. Neighbours who heard the commotion had rushed to the scene and prevented him from ending his life.
The husband who was rushed to hospital is in a critical condition struggling between life and death.
The postmortem examination was held yesterday.

I Promise you a Rose Garden
So, guess what once again ranks as the No. 1 fad when it comes to outdoor leisure activities Jogging Nope. Biking or tennis Wrong, try again.
Golf or swimming Three times and you are out.
It's gardening!
The very thing that makes Willa Cather's fictional narrator gasp as he sinks into his grandmother's garden, "This is happiness!" The very thing Taylor Swift loves to do with her window boxes in New York and the very thing Julia Roberts has embraced with undying passion, composting her kitchen scraps and building an organic kitchen garden in the backyard of her Malibu home.
Forget smart phones, selfi sticks and iPads; believe it or not, the latest must-have accessory for the 21st century is fast becoming a watering can and a trowel. This is mainly because the sensory experience of gardening "allows people to connect to a primal state," says James Jiler, the founder and executive director of a nonprofit organization that creates garden and park programs for low-income neighborhoods in the US. "A lot of people understand that experience. They may not be able to put it into words, but they understand what's happening," explains Jiler.
Other rewards
Working in the garden has other, less spiritual rewards, too. In addition to providing fresh, healthy produce for your family, gardening can ease stress, keep you fit, and even improve your mood. A recent study in the Netherlands suggests that gardening can fight stress even better than other relaxing leisure activities. Here's how. After completing a stressful task, two groups of people were instructed to either read indoors or garden for 30 minutes. Afterwards, the group that gardened reported being in a better mood than the reading group, and they also had lower levels of the stress hormone cortisol."We live in a society where we're just maxing ourselves out all the time," observes Andrea Taylor, a horticulture instructor and researcher in the University of Illinois.
Taylor also notes that humans have a finite capacity for the kind of directed attention required by cell phones and email and the like, and when that capacity gets used up we tend to become irritable, error-prone, and stressed out. Fortunately this "attention fatigue" appears to be reversible. Following a theory first suggested by University of Michigan researchers in the 1980s, Taylor and other experts have argued that we can replenish ourselves by engaging in "involuntary attention," an effortless form of attention that we use to enjoy nature.
So, trading your BlackBerry for blackberry bushes could be an excellent way to fight stress and attention fatigue, as the rhythms of the natural environment and the repetitive, soothing nature of many gardening tasks are all sources of effortless attention.
"The breeze blows, things get dew on them, things flower; the sounds, the smells," says Taylor, herself a home gardener. "All of these draw on that form of attention."
Fresh air and sunshine
Another benefit of gardening is that it gets you out in the fresh air and sunshine - and it also gets your blood moving. "There are lots of different movements in gardening, so you get some exercise benefits out of it as well," says gardening expert William Maynard. True, gardening is hardly pumping iron, and unless you are hauling wheelbarrows of dirt long distances every day, it probably won't do much for your cardiovascular fitness. But digging, planting, weeding, and other repetitive tasks that require strength or stretching are excellent forms of low-impact exercise, especially for people who find more vigorous exercise a challenge, such as those who are older, have disabilities, or suffer from chronic pain.
As a pleasurable and goal-oriented outdoor activity, gardening has another advantage over other forms of exercise: People are more likely to stick with it and do it often. "It's not just exercise for exercise itself, which can become tedious," says one expert. "It's exercise that has a context, that reinforces the limberness of your limbs and the use of your hands. You've got a motivation for why you want to grip. You're not just gripping a ball, you want to pull a weed."
Some research suggests that the physical activity associated with gardening can help lower the risk of developing dementia, too. Two separate studies that followed people in their 60s and 70s for up to 16 years found, respectively, that those who gardened regularly had a 36% and 47% lower risk of dementia than non-gardeners, even when a range of other health factors were taken into account. These findings are hardly definitive, but they suggest that the combination of physical and mental activity involved in gardening may have a positive influence on the mind as the sights, smells, and sounds of the garden are said to promote relaxation and reduce stress.
Gardening in containers
And the best news is you don't need a big backyard or a green thumb to benefit from gardening. If you have very little space or experience, you can start out with just a few houseplants, or you could even try gardening in containers. "You can grow a wonderful crop of tomatoes in nothing more than a five-gallon bucket that you've cleaned really well and put holes in the bottom of," says one expert. For novices who want to learn the basics of gardening, a huge -- and somewhat overwhelming -- variety of information is available on the Web and in bookstores. But one of the best ways to get started is to meet some other gardeners, especially those living in your neighbourhood. For some great gardening tips, just start up a conversation with one of the gardeners next time you are passing by his or her garden. Now that we are experiencing afternoon showers, if you haven't started a garden yet, may I suggest that you do so, straight away. It might take some time to get used to, but it's worth it. I know because, I confess even though it has been two years since I started my garden I am still not a very good gardener. I killed a Kathurumurunga plant recently because I forgot to check the leaves for caterpillars. I have had to apologize to plants that I have planted in the wrong place. But I'm learning every day and I know, you will too, once you get down to it.
And pretty soon you will realize gardening is the only activity you can still do when you are worried or angry or sad. As ardent gardener Julie Myserson says, "Tending a garden is a meditative, humbling experience: you can't force anything, you just have to wait. And yet every time you put something in the ground, it feels like a pronouncement of faith in the future - or at least in the next few months." I hope pretty soon you will be so addicted to your new hobby you will be gardening till your whole body hurts, until you know you should stop but you can't, because you have realized nothing will make you happier than kneeling down in the dirt with the soft evening sunshine on your back, weeding a bed of roses or chili plants by hand, watched over by your cat and a friendly squirrel knowing that all around you, things are growing. Imagine being able to promise your loved one a basket of homegrown vegetables and 'a rose garden' one day soon.
Caring for plants is good for us. Here's why.
1. Better health. Producing your own food can increase your family's fruit and vegetable consumption and improve their attitude toward healthy eating.
2. Access to fresh food. Fruits and vegetables that you grow yourself are often more flavorful because they come straight from the garden to your plate. Supermarket produce is often picked before it has the chance to fully develop flavor.
3. Burn calories. Working in a garden is a great form of low-impact exercise. According to the American Council for Fitness and Nutrition, you can burn around 150 calories in just a 30- to 45-minute garden session.
4. Feel accomplished. Gardening can help build self-esteem and confidence. A healthy harvest produces a sense of achievement when you see the results of your time and effort.
5. Save money. Growing your own fruits and vegetables will help cut down on your grocery bill. Plant crops that you enjoy eating and use often such as tomatoes, chili and green-leaves
6. Improve your child's development. Studies have shown that garden-based education
improves academic performance in children and may lead to higher test scores (especially in the areas of math and science) with overall improvement on standardized achievement tests and improved positive attitudes toward learning.
7. Ease stress. Gardening can be therapeutic and relaxing. A garden can serve as a peaceful retreat from the demands of everyday life.
8. Get the whole family involved. From selecting the types of plants, to preparing the earth, planting and finally harvesting, gardening is a wonderful outdoor activity that your family can enjoy together.
9. Enhance your creativity.Designing a garden provides an outlet for creativity and expression. With the wide variety of seeds available, it's easy to experiment with new plants or change the color scheme of your garden annually.
10. Beautify the area. Gardens enhance any outdoor setting. Flowers add color and warmth to a home; trees and shrubs provide shade and shelter for birds and other wildlife.

I WAS PART OF THE COLOR RUN 2017...
The Z Club of Colombo collaborated with the Interact Club of St. Josephs College, the Community Service Club of Asian International School, and the Interact Club of Colombo to present The Colour Run 2017 in aid of The Rainforest Trust of Sri Lanka.
On March 11 approximately 300 people gathered at the Independence Square to run 3km, to bring colour back to the rainforests of Sri Lanka. Each of the participants sponsored saplings to be planted in the Uda Kirawa forest corridor, each contributing to extension of the forests and the health of the planet in their own little way. The run commenced with an introduction to the Trusts goals and work by Trustee, Chris Tilakesri Dharmakirth. By 8.30am, clad in white t-shirts with the slogan I WAS PART OF THE COLOR RUN 2017, they ran, and some faster than expected!
The surprise of the event  water squirting, and splashing of Holicolour, (the biodegradable variety) at various points en route to the delight of the runners and passers-by  flashes of blue, yellow, purple, red, orange - through streets of Colombo ended up at the Racecourse pavilion like an endless rainbow. The participants were victorious and rejuvenated, in that moment, and in hopes for the future they had run for.
Attending the event, the 15-year-old President of Z Club, Eshana Amarasighes aid, We decided on a Colour Run because the rainforests, unlike sustainable timber forests, are much more than just green. They give life and colour to the world we live in. Weve learnt how most of our food products, medicines (both preventive and curative), come from the forest plants. Some are still being tested. Weve also learnt that it is a human activity, some of it inevitable due to population expansion and urbanization, that causes the depletion of rainforests. Weve experienced firsthand, the resulting destruction caused by climate imbalances like floods and droughts, natural disasters, etc. So, the least we, as the future generation, could do for ourselves is to make sure we stay aware and work as a team to help rebuild our rainforests, in a practical, sustainable way. It is, literally, Run or Dye as our slogan goes
The Trust aims to restore and rebuild lost forests, through the ground-breaking analog forestry program designed by a passionate ecologist, Dr. Ranil Senanayake with decades of research knowledge and experience. The work of the Trust is two-fold: first is the forest corridor project such as that in UdaKirawa, whereby parcels of land surrounding rainforests are purchased and replanted with the same composition of plants, which are grown in the second project; the plant nursery, such as the one in Belipola. The plants are all grown organically, and this approach is seen by experts in the field, both locally and internationally, as far more ecologically sustainable and profitable than industrial reforestation programs.
Vice President of the Interact Club of St Josephs College, Sheehan De Zilva commented We were proud to have been a part of organizing such a successful event in aid of a great cause. It was both an enjoyable and educational experience for us all and we hope to continue this endeavor with The Z Club in 2018!Mithara Silva, representing the Community Service Club of AIS noted, The width and diversity of participation we saw today is what would carry the message and sustain these efforts. Our club was glad to have helped with the organization and running of the event, and we hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as we did!
Dr. Mala Tudawe Trustee of RT thanked Z Club and the participants for their initiative and contribution. She said that whilst the Trust continues their work to raise awareness and preserve the remaining forests, she was happy and relieved that the youth had taken an initiative to kick start this event which she hopes would be repeated each year with even more participation.
Eshana Amarasinghe of Z Club agreed What began today as an awareness building initiative must gather momentum from now on - to become a movement. Colour Run 2018 must definitely be bigger and bolder! The event was a resounding success. rasinge, KishoriOpatha, and KishenPieris

Ivan Abadzhiev, the Pope of Weightlifting, dies at 85
BELGRADE, Saturday: Former Bulgarian weightlifting coach Ivan Abadzhiev, one of the sports most successful and prominent figures, has died aged 85, officials said on Saturday.
Widely known as The Pope of Weightlifting, Abadzhiev led Bulgaria to 10 Olympic, 57 world and 64 European titles between 1968 and 2000, making weightlifting the Balkan countrys most successful sport. As a competitor, he won Bulgarias first world championship medal after finishing second in the 67.5-kg category in Tehran in 1957.
Voted the coach of the century in Bulgaria, Abadzhiev introduced a training methodology based on high-intensity sessions that is still followed widely by top weightlifters and coaches. He was known for the level of discipline and commitment he demanded from his athletes. Abadzhiev, who went on to train the Turkish national team in the 1990s, also served as a lawmaker in his homeland before moving to work in coaching in the United States. - Agencies

Jane Austen has alt-right fans who have clearly never read her work properly, scholar suggests
Study observes references to Pride & Prejudice author in several white supremacist blogs Jane Austen has an unlikely fanbase in the form of America's so-called 'alt-right' movement, it has emerged.
Scholars have found that 'alt-right' websites and blogs often reference the Pride and Prejudice author, believing that her work supports marital traditionalism, along with their views on racial purity and subservient wives.
A Victorian novelist
An assistant professor of English at the University of Colorado, Nicole Wright, found that there were "several variations of alt-right Jane Austen: 1) Symbol of sexual purity; 2) Standard-bearer of a vanished white traditional culture; and 3) Exception that proves the rule of female inferiority".
Writing in a Chronicle of Higher Education article she noted that there was an Austen cameo in a speech by the disgraced former Breitbart journalist Milo Yiannopoulos made in January, where he said: "As a Victorian novelist might have put it, it is a truth universally acknowledged that an ugly woman is more likely to be a feminist than a hot one."
(Wright also pointed out the amusing inaccuracy by Yiannopoulos, as the Regency-era author died around 20 years before the Victorian period began.)
Gang-bangs
Similarly Andrew Anglin, a white supremacist who blogs for the Daily Stormer website, used Austen when portraying pop star Taylor Swift as a "Nazi idol".
"She [Swift] is the anti-Miley [Cyrus]," he told Vice. "While Miley is out having gang-bangs with coloured gentlemen, she is at home with her cat reading Jane Austen."
In her article, Wright suggests that white supremacists believe that Austen makes for a better figurehead for their movement because of her associations with a "cozy England", in comparison to "the nightmare Germany of Hitler and Goebbels".
But as any Austen fan would know, and as retired professor Elaine Bander told the New York Times, "no one who reads Jane Austen's words with any attention and reflection can possible be alt-right".
"All the Janeites I know are rational, compassionate, liberal-minded people," she said.

Lack of water deprived farmers of cultivation: Ampara paddy fields abandoned

A discussion on the Yala season paddy cultivation was held in the Alayadivembu DS division in the Ampara District recently.
Farmers were told at the meeting that the Agrarian Services Department and the Irrigation Department would help them in cultivating paddy by April 2017.
The entire extent of paddy lands in the District can not be cultivated due to the drought, they were informed.
Accordingly, only certain areas in each division were identified for cultivating paddy during the season.
In the Alayadivembu division, 1030 out of 2955 acres were approved for cultivations. Paddymedu North Kandam -180, Paddymedu South Kandam  100, Paddymedu Central Kandam  100, Moddyagal Kandam  220, Chenai Kandam -210 and Uoorakai Kandam - 220 acres were allowed for Yala cultivation.
Alayadivembu Divisional Secretary V.Jegatheesan presided the meeting. The Eastern Province Deputy Irrigation Director Umarlebbe Nazar, Assistant Divisional Secretary T. Kajenthiran, Provincial Irrigation Engineer, Agricultural Divisional Officers, Technical Officers, Grama Niladharies, and farmers participated in the meeting.
About 58 percent of regional paddy lands will not be cultivated due to water scarcity.
A bag of paddy was sold at Rs: 3,300 at the beginning but now a bag is sold at Rs:2,800.

Land laws, woes and way out
Continued from March 24
State land under major irrigated settlement scheme had been allocated to the initial settlers under various extents from time to time with restriction, preventing sale and sub division into parcels less than 1.5 acres in case of lowlands and 0.5 acre for highland as stated in the Land Development Ordinance of 1935 and its subsequent amendments. However, with the development of settlement schemes and population growth, original allotments have been informally subdivided among the descendants according to customary practices disregarding the legal restrictions. The findings of the research reveal that there is a growing pressure from beneficiaries to amend the existing statute to legalize further fragmentation.
An analysis of the findings on the subject of informal land fragmentation in settlement schemes in Sri Lanka reveals that about 57% and 30% of the existing lowland and highland plots respectively in the major irrigated settlement schemes are informally fragmented. About 28% of the lowland plots have been fragmented into less than 1.5 acres in extent, being the official minimum limit permitted under the LDO as amended. Primary reason for land fragmentation is to provide the settlement land for their children, which is considered by the farmers as their social obligation to treat all the children equally. Therefore most of the farmers are willing to divide the land parcels equally among all their children disregarding the minimum size specified above under the Land Development Ordinance as amended.
Over 35% of the population in the country is directly or indirectly dependent on land. Therefore, land fragmentation as found in the research studies causes many issues related to social, economic, political, cultural and environmental problems. Some of the direct effects of land fragmentation are reduced land productivity, intensive cultivation, cultivation of reservation lands and disputes among community members harming social integration. Formal sub-division land into small parcels is expected to create problems in water management and irrigation system operation and maintenance (O&M) because of higher resource requirement (physical and human) for the O&M. Increased number of small legal land holdings and higher irrigation water requirements can also cause more drainage from each land block. The study indicated that the legal transfer of small pieces of land would pave the way for farmers to sell their allotments outside their family which could create complaints on managing water between small plots breaking current harmony that prevail within family members. Since pressure on land in the settlement schemes gives rise to fragmentation of allotments, means must be devised to ease pressure on State land.
Encroachment on State land
The research conducted on encroachment on State land reveals that it is not a recent phenomenon and has occurred earlier in the major settlement schemes. For example, the survey of encroachments on State land undertaken by the Ministry of Land and Land Development in 1979 reveals that by that time 6% of State land were under encroachment of various forms. The studies conducted later for example in 1990 revealed that encroachment ranged in size from amount 0.1 ha or more with an average size of 0.6 ha (1.6 acres). As far as the Dry Zone is concerned, encroachment in this zone are of two basic types: (a) those associated with State sponsored settlements and (b) those associated with traditional villages.
The settlement projects, particularly those provided with irrigation facilities attract encroachments. At least two parallel processes are at work in creating settlement based encroachments. One process results from the attraction of settlement projects for non- settlers as places of concentration of economic opportunities in and otherwise scarcely populated and economically lagging region. For them, encroachment spells a high risk of complaints and eviction by regular settlers and officials alike. The other process results from the desire of settlers to ensure satisfaction of future land, food, income security and living level maintenance needs of their families. In this sense, encroachment is also a future risk aversion strategy. The maximum encroachment upon reservation land within the settlement schemes occurs in the very early stages of settlement. This probably reflects a move by new settlers anticipating future scarcities to ensure a means of existence to their succeeding generations.
The evaluation of research findings indicate that the expansion of cultivable acreage of settlement property through encroachment is largely a product of subsistence pressures. It is also a reflection of prevailing poverty conditions and lack of opportunities beyond those associated with land and agriculture. Thus, the pre-occupation with land that is reflected in the incidence of the encroachment is a symptom of a more deep- seated failure of the settlement encompassing region economy to generate adequate employment and income opportunities at a pace above the rates of growth of the population.
The regularlisation of encroachment, although politically attractive and administratively convenient is incompatible firstly with the policy of mapping- out of State land so fervently advocated by the first Land Commission of 1927 and secondly with the land use planning. This has further complicated the problem of water management too.
Section 20 of the original LDO provides for selection of people for alienation of State land through the Land Kachcheri. However, section 20 as amended by Land Development (Amendment) Act of 1969 changed this procedure and permitted under section 20A allowing selection of people outside the Land Kachcheri also. As a remedy to the encroachment problem, the government has as stated above amended the LDO whereby selection to State land allotments has been relaxed to accommodate encroachments. The regularization of encroachment is effected through this section 20A. Due to possibility of irregularities and corruptions that may occur in utilizing this amended section. Circular has been issued. The Circular in this regard is Circular No.2005/2/ and dated 2005.01.25 issued by the Land Commissioner General to Provincial Land Commissioners, Deputy Land Commissioners and Assistant Land Commissioners on the subject of Forwarding Reports under section 20A of the Land Development Ordinance for Approval.
This Circular noted that doubts have arisen with regard to choice of a person on transparency. Therefore after the date of the Circular in furnishing reports for approval under section 20A of the LDO for regularization of encroachments, the Land Commissioner General instructs the Provincial Land Commissioners, Deputy Land Commissioners and Assistant Land Commissioners to advise all Divisional Secretaries to follow the procedure embodied in the Circular. The procedure includes (a) public inspection of persons by Divisional Secretaries, (b) calling objections after publication of the list of persons selected, (c) after reviewing the objections the report by the Divisional Secretary to the Land Commissioner General or Provincial Land Commissioner on the selection of persons. It is hereby recommended to strictly enforce this Circular.
It is our view that some encroachments, specially environmentally sensitive reservations cannot be regularized. Therefore it is essential where such reservations have been encroached, action should be taken against such encroachers. It is preferable to prevent encroachments to State land rather than taking action after encroachments by the proper exercise of powers by the officials authorized to do so: e.g. Divisional Secretaries in their areas of authority with the blessings of central authority.
Informal land transactions
According to the analysis of the findings, informal operation of lowland is prominent in settlement schemes. The most popular informal transaction methods are leasing on fixed produce (vee badu), leasing on cash and mortgaging. The other methods are purchasing without legal documents, fragmenting, jointly managing and encroaching on government and private lands. The common reasons for informal land transactions are the shortage of family labour for cultivating the land and difficulty of cultivating because legally entrusted parties living far away from the land.
One major reason for labour problem in settler families was the dislike of second and third generation members of settlers families to engage in agriculture as income from agriculture was unattractive. One important reason for leasing out is the need of money for emergency requirements. The informal tenure  transactions methods are diverse depending on land rent, cultivation rights and terms and conditions on managing the land.
Findings of the research on cultivation of allotments under informal land transactions revealed both benefits and disadvantages to the settlers and allotments. As regards benefits, even with less security of tenure, the informal operators have resorted to cash as well as non cash investments towards obtaining maximum returns in the same manner as owner cultivators. With regard to the application of inputs and technological use, informal operators are in a better position. With regard to yield obtained too, informal operators appear to have higher level yield than owner operators. On the average the returns from paddy under different tenure conditions were higher than under owner operator systems.
However, under leasing on cash systems, the land owner lost the cultivation rights of land for about 4 and 5 years and in many cases land owner has become a labourer by hiring his labour on his own land. Under mortgage system, land owner loses cultivation rights until the loan is paid. The most severe damage to the holding due to informal land transaction is the fragmentation of the holding resulting in the emergence of uneconomic holdings on the one hand and consolidation of land by rich people on the other hand. As revealed in the study, informal operators do not conform to common production plan and common decision of farmers which is a severe burden for the implementation of a common production plan. Moreover, where the land is given on informal land transactions, legal owner do not invest for improving the long term productivity of the land as preparation of ridges and maintenance of canals etc.
As the findings of research study indicate, subdividing and transferring of small parcels or distributing the ownership of land among a number of children equally is a major requirement for many of the legal owner operators in the settlement schemes. Granting of freehold titles will allow them to effect such transfers legally. But there is a possibility of fragmentation of land into uneconomic smaller parcels. This will be an impediment to achieving the objective of settlements namely increasing productivity. It is also contradictory to the important concepts using resources such as land and water more effectively and efficiently because fragmentation would cause wastage of water and breakdown of the common system of managing water. Therefore, legal transfer, if any should be subject to the minimum extent of, for example one acre in extent.
In major settlement schemes, where informal land transactions take place, as the findings of the research reveal, one group does not utilize land productively due to various reasons such as shortage of labour and capital or non availability of management capability. Another group utilizes it more productively by using their capabilities to use advanced technology, invest capital and application of knowledge. Although views have been expressed that informal land transaction in major settlement schemes should be formalized by permitting transfer of land legally into the hands of efficient operators, that would result in displacement of one category of peasants from the land, thereby becoming labourers of their own allotments by wealthy section of people either by some other farmers or outside rich land seekers which is in evidence under findings of research. In consequence, the prosperity of peasantry as a social class being an important objective of Land Commission of 1927 and the Land Development Ordinance, is thereby gradually defeated creating landless farmers.
The objective of protected tenure is to give protection to peasants as peasantry against unjust uneconomic activities. To give profits and to provide security are related, but different objectives to be achieved. There is no question that the peasants in the major irrigated settlement schemes earn their livelihood also contributing to the agricultural development of the country, when considering the vast investments made by the State. On the other hand, peasants are to be protected as an important section of the society from unjust economic activities. As producers of staple food of the people of the country - rice from ancient times to date, the peasantry must be protected by the State not only as producers, but also as a recognized social class. The peasantry must be protected until they get hold of a firm and stable position in the major irrigated settlement schemes so as to face successfully such adverse situations. The process of informal land transactions in the major irrigated scheme should not be allowed to operate to the detriment of the peasantry  displacement of the peasantry.
According to the study, the granting of freehold right to settlement land, which provides opportunity to the settlers to handle land freely without any restrictions, is an aspiration of many settlers. It is our considered view that granting freehold title at this stage, where peasantry as a whole has not yet consolidated their position as a category of peasantry, will expedite the two ways process of informal land transactions already referred to by research studies endangering the peasantry as a social and prosperous group. In terms of productivity and profitability also the informal operators were in a better position than the owner cultivators. The productivity of land which had been leased on cash prefixed produce and on mortgage was higher than the productivity of legally owned operators land. Therefore it is our view that some sort of formality needs be given to informal land transactions retaining at least low restrictions on tenure by the State. Where even under informal land transactions such as lease, if productivity is maintained, with the application of advanced technology, then it is reasonable to give some formality to such informal land transactions under suitable criteria and under some State control.
Profitability of irrigated paddy sector
Despite the decline of the share of agriculture in national output an increasing industrial and services sector output, agriculture still plays an important role and increasing the countrys food supply as well as providing employment opportunities specially for the rural sector. The production of rice, the staple food of the people is the mainstay of majority of households in Sri Lanka. The paddy sector has been highly intervened by the government through various policy measures over the years. In spite of those intervensions, the entire domestic agriculture sector is driven by small producers who are neither in a position to get economies of scale in the production nor to maintain sufficient surplus for the market. Irrespective of the fact that all the successive government followed some intensive measures to protect paddy farmers, as the research reveals, their living standards have been continually deteriorating over the years owing to rising production cost over the farm gate price and yield improvements.
There is no strong relationship between cash costs and paddy output. This suggests that cash costs do not necessarily enhance yield. On the contrary, management practices and level of technology are more important other than cash outlay. The results reveal that the average yield has been marginally increased (2% per year) during the past decade. Even the highest yield obtained is 5 Mt. /ha which is almost half of the potential yield of 10 mt. ha that could be obtained under well managed conditions. Examination of the data from the past decade on gross income and net income indicate that the paddy farmers real income has deteriorated over the years. Therefore it is understood that paddy farmers in Sri Lanka are currently struggling in the face of rising cost of production and unfavourable farm gate prices.
Recommendations
The recommendation can be presented under the following heads: land policy, fragmentation of allotments, encroachment of State land, informal land transactions and irrigated paddy sector.
1. Land Policy
Since the State emphasis on State land had somewhat shifted away from State ownership to State trust, it is necessary to make it clear that any government would therefore be falling short of its duty, if it neglects such a trust.
 The land policy must necessarily form an integral and organic component of whole national development strategy. It should neither be treated in isolation nor confined to State land alone, but must rather be a comprehensive review at national level. Since there are three categories of land namely land vested in the Central Government, land vested in the Provincial Councils and that of private lands, the land administration and management have to be adjusted and re-structured accordingly.
 The concept of preservation of peasantry as suggested by the Land Commission of 1927 and endorsed by the Land Commission of 1987 must still be relevant for some time to come in view of the need for protecting them from economic, social, political marginalization of which there is already adequate evidence.
 The changes in land settlement policy which has been aimed at attracting large scale private enterprise and capital into peasant agriculture would, inter alia, accelerate the differentiation of process of the peasantry. Therefore agrarian unrest would reach unmanageable proportions if no programmes are initiated to develop the small peasant proprietors on a sound basis and to increase the labour absorptive capabilities in agriculture.
2. Fragmentation of Allotments
 An amendment to the Land Development Ordinance is recommended to allow the family members to fragment the lowland in the event of death of original land owner where, there is no nomination to succeed to the land allotment. The Amendment must provide entitlement not only to the eldest son but also to any one of the family members nominated by the consensus of other family members irrespective of gender but within the minimum limit of one acre in extent for lowland and  acre for highland. While the initial holder is alive too, the holder may be allowed to still fragment the allotment among the children subject to the above minimum. In both cases disposition should be effected through Land Commissioner/ Provincial Land Commissioner and Divisional Secretary.
 It is necessary to minimize pressure on land in the settlement schemes by creating off  farm employment opportunities and providing priorities for new generation people of the old settlement schemes in allocating land under new land alienation programmes.
3. Encroachment on State land
 At present the regularization of encroachment is effected through section 20A of the Land Development Ordinance as amended. Due to possibilities of irregularities and corruptions that may occur in making use of this amended section, a Circular has been issued. This Circular is Circular No. 2005/2 and dated 2005.01.25. issued by the Land Commissioner General to the Provincial Land Commissioners, Deputy Land Commissioners and Assistant Land Commissioners on the subject of Forwarding Reports under Section 20A of the Land Development Ordinance for Approval. It is recommended to strictly implement this Circular.
 However, some encroachments, specially environmentally sensitive reservations cannot be regularized. Therefore it is essential where such reservations have been encroached, action should be taken against such encroachers. It is preferable to prevent encroachments to State land by the proper exercise of powers by the Officials who are authorized to do so eg., Divisional Secretaries in their areas of authority with the definite blessings of the central political authority.
 It is imperative to devise and implement measures, long- term, island-wide, to control the problem of acute pressure of population on State land resulting in encroachment through among others, proper socio-economic measures.
4. Informal land transactions
 While there is no argument against the efficient utilization of State land, efficient utilization of State land should not give rise to displacement of peasantry from the farmland by the operation of unjust competition and illegal market operation. Private interests geared by pure economic competition should not be allowed to operate to defeat public interest. Therefore peasantry should be protected by the State by suitable means such as minimum protected tenure, strengthening institutional and extension services to them, marketing facilities, general welfare facilities until they become strengthened enough to maintain engaging in agricultural activities in the allotments on their own.
 The granting of freehold title need not be given to them at this stage since they have not yet consolidated their position as an economically safe category of peasantry. The granting freehold title would at this stage expedite the two way process of informal land transaction referred to above, endangering the peasantry as a social and prosperous group. It is also noted here that compared to original legislative form in the Land Development Ordinance, the restrictions on the controls of allotment by the allottees have been minimized today, the minimum remaining is for the benefit of themselves.
 Since in terms of productivity and profitability, informal paddy farmers maintain good standards, some sort of formality need be given to informal land transactions under suitable criteria and under State control. However, subdividing of an allotment should be maintained at the minimum of one acre in extent for lowland and  acre for highland.
5. Profitability of irrigated paddy sector
As revealed in the analysis of findings at least five acres of paddy land have to be cultivated to obtain a profit level above the poverty line if present economy conditions are prevailed. Therefore it is understood that paddy income only is not sufficient to get rid of poverty if farmers continue to cultivate present land sizes. Hence it is important to prevent further fragmentation of paddy land and if possible rules and regulations need to be introduced to consolidate paddy lands. Time has arrived to go for commercial paddy farming instead of subsistence home based paddy cultivation. To improve profitability, farmers need to diversify crops in existing paddy lands. Moreover this study recommends bridging the knowledge gap of the paddy farmers, dissemination of new technology among the farmers, promoting the use of organic manure, assuring paddy farmers to receive at least prevailing procurement prices, proper management of the PMB stores, enhancement of efficient paddy purchasing and distribution programme and obtain private sector contribution in order to improve the efficiency of selling paddy and purchasing other inputs by paddy farmers under proper government control where necessary.

Lanka hikes policy rates
As per the provisional estimates of the Department of Census and Statistics (DCS), the Sri Lankan economy has recorded a growth of 4.4% in real terms during 2016 compared to the growth of 4.8 per cent in 2015.
Within this annual growth, industry related activities grew notably by 6.7% driven by construction related activities, while Services related activities grew by 4.2% mainly with the expansion of financial services, insurance and telecommunications. However, Agriculture related activities contracted by 4.2% in 2016, impacted by supply side disruptions on account of floods in the second quarter and drought conditions during the final quarter of 2016.
In spite of challenging external factors such as adverse weather conditions and global developments, an acceleration of growth was observed towards end 2016 with the last quarter of 2016 recording a growth of 5.3%, partly supported by the base effect.
In the meantime, headline inflation, as measured by the year-on-year change in the Colombo Consumers Price Index (CCPI, 2013=100), accelerated to 6.8% in February 2017 from 5.5% in January 2017.
A similar trend was observed in the National Consumer Price Index (NCPI, 2013=100) based headline inflation, which rose to 8.2% (year-on-year) in February 2017 from 6.5 per cent in January 2017. Year-on-year core inflation based on both CCPI and NCPI also remained high at 7.1% in February 2017.
The recent acceleration in inflation is largely due to the impact of prevailing drought conditions and adjustments to the tax structure, and it is projected that inflation would revert to the desired mid single digit levels in the period ahead and stabilise thereafter, unless disrupted by adverse inflation expectations.
The earlier tightening of monetary policy and monetary conditions by the Central Bank and the resultant increase in market interest rates are likely to have impacted the growth of credit to the private sector by commercial banks to some extent.
Accordingly, the year-on-year growth of private sector credit decelerated further to 20.9% in January 2017 from 21.9% at end 2016.
Meanwhile, credit to the public sector increased noticeably, causing year-on-year broad money (M2b) growth to remain high at 17.7% in January 2017, although this was a deceleration compared to 18.4% in Dec. 2016.
Nevertheless, the deceleration in monetary and credit aggregates has been slower than expected.
On the external front, the deficit in the trade account of the balance of payments (BOP) was recorded at US dollars 9.1 billion in 2016 compared to US dollars 8.4 billion in 2015, with expenditure on imports increasing by 2.5 per cent and earnings from exports contracting by 2.2 per cent during the year.
Provisional data for January 2017 also indicated a widening of the trade deficit. Earnings from tourism and workers' remittances continued to cushion the adverse impact of the trade deficit on the BOP. In the meantime, outflows of foreign investments from the government securities market observed in early 2017 appear to have subsided, and marginal inflows have been experienced in spite ofthe increase in policy interest rates in the United States.
Gross official reserves remained at US dollars 5.6 billion at end February 2017 compared to US dollars 6 billion at end 2016, while the Sri Lankan rupee depreciated by 1.2 per cent against the US dollar during the year up to 22 March 2017.
Considering the above developments, the Monetary Board, at its meeting held on 23 March 2017, was of the view that further tightening of monetary policy is necessary as a precautionary measure, to contain the build-up of adverse inflation expectations and the possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressures through excessive monetary and credit expansion.
The Monetary Board also took into account the notable improvements in fiscal operations, which have resulted in the overall budget deficit in 016 declining to envisaged levels.
The Board was of the view that these improvements, together with the substantial upward movements already observed in market interest rates, have reduced the required adjustment in policy interest rates.
Accordingly, the Monetary Board decided to increase the key policy interest rates of the Central Bank, namely the Standing Deposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing Lending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 25 basis points each, to 7.25 per cent and 8.75 per cent, respectively, with effect from 24 March 2017.

Lankan, Indian Navies in joint ocean survey
The Indian and Sri Lankan Navies will be conducting a joint oceanographic survey off the Southern Coast of Sri Lanka from March 30 to May 11.
The aim of the joint survey is to update all the navigational charts covering the southern Sri Lankan waters with the latest hydrographic data and to further cooperation between the two countries in the field of hydrography.
The survey will be useful in enhancing the level of navigational safety of all ships visiting Sri Lanka.
Indian Naval ship INS Darshak, an indigenously designed and constructed vessel that is fitted with the latest state-of-the-art survey equipment would visit Sri Lanka to undertake the survey. Personnel from Survey Branch of the Sri Lanka Navy would be embarked onboard the ship to take part in the conduct of the survey.
During the survey, extensive training would also be conducted for the embarked Sri Lanka Navy personnel. This would assist in capacity building of Sri Lanka Navys Hydrographic Department and would provide an opportunity for both navies to learn from each other and to build on the already existing high level of interoperability between the two navies.
During its deployment, INS Darshak will also visit ports of Colombo and Galle. During the ships stay in harbour, a series of community welfare activities, sports, and professional training exchanges have been planned between the ships crew and Sri Lanka Navy personnel.

Latham shines in New Zealand gloom
HAMILTON: A rejuvenated Tom Latham ensured a positive start to New Zealand's reply after Quinton de Kock bolstered South Africa with a defiant 90 on another wet day in the third Test in Hamilton.
When bad light ended play four overs early on Sunday, New Zealand were 67 without loss in reply to South Africa's 314.
Latham, who managed 24 in total in three previous innings in the series, was unbeaten on 42 after coming out on the right side of two reviews, with Jeet Raval on 25.
With New Zealand needing to win to square the series, it proved a successful day for Latham who had a standout performance in the field highlighted by an instinctive catch at short leg to remove Faf du Plessis.
But de Kock proved a much tougher obstacle on a frustrating day for the players when only 26 balls were possible between lunch and tea after rain also cost nearly three hours of play the previous day.
Just as his 91 in the first innings in Wellington set up South Africa up for an eight-wicket victory, de Kock again tormented New Zealand with his trouble-free approach.
Smart fielding
When he went to the middle with the fall of Temba Bavuma's wicket, South Africa were 148 for five and he held the innings together while the bottom half of the batting order added a further 166.
De Kock's 90 came off only 118 balls, highlighting why captain Faf du Plessis was determined to have him play despite the wicketkeeper-batsman suffering ligament damage to his right index finger.
He hit 11 fours and two huge sixes, one off New Zealand's best performed bowler Matt Henry and one off Jeetan Patel, as he dominated the off-spinner who had claimed his wicket cheaply in the drawn first Test. But 10 runs short of his century he played across the line to Neil Wagner and was out lbw. South Africa resumed the day at 123 for four and after Henry removed Bavuma for 29, du Plessis progressed to 53 before a smart piece of fielding by Latham at short leg.
On the third ball of Mitch Santner's opening over, Latham anticipated du Plessis was going to sweep and before the shot was played he was moving to his right where he flung out an arm to take the close-range catch. Latham took another classy catch, just above ground level to his right at second slip to remove Vernon Philander for 11 off Henry.
Henry equalled his career best figures with four for 93, while Neil Wagner, who took three for an expensive 104, ended the South Africa innings with the wicket of the hard-hitting Kagiso Rabada who scored 34 off 31 deliveries.

Officers from the National Drugs Regulatory Authority raided a leading pharmaceuticals distribution centre at Katugastota on March 25 and seized a stock of sample drugs intended for sale.
The raid followed information that drug samples being prepared for sale to customers were being transferred to other boxes after removing the Not for Sale label. Drug authority sources said the sample drugs included those issued in respect of major diseases such as high blood pressure, asthma and catarrh.
Although the centre also had a stock of outdated drugs, they did not take any action regarding it since pharmacies had the right to stock outdated items to be returned to principal agents.
The owner of the pharmaceutical centre was released on a Rs. 100,000 bond and ordered to appear before the Kandy Magistrate on March 30.

Lyon roars for Australia in fourth India Test
Dharamsala: Australian off-spinner Nathan Lyon was the hero on an engrossing second day of the series-deciding fourth and final Test on Sunday, taking four key Indian wickets
The 29-year-old made the most of a lively track at Dharamsala, which is hosting its first Test, to return a rich haul of 4-67.
Fast bowlers Josh Hazlewood (1-40) and Pat Cummins (1-59) also bowled their hearts out during frugal spells to restrict the top-ranked hosts to 248-6 at stumps.
India still trail by 52 runs with four wickets in hand after Australia made 300 in their first knock, largely thanks to a fine 111 from captain Steve Smith.
At stumps Wriddhiman Saha was batting on 10 with Ravindra Jadeja on 16.
There was a bit out there for me, Lyon said after the days play.
We bowled well in partnerships. We would like to come out and bowl well again tomorrow and take the four wickets and then bat well.
They are a world-class batting line-up and you have to challenge them consistently.
The Indian batsmen were guilty of squandering good starts in a match they must win to regain the Border-Gavaskar trophy.
But Lokesh Rahul (60) and Cheteshwar Pujara (57) batted patiently to put on 87 for the second wicket, the best partnership so far for the hosts.
Its by far the best wicket we have played on, theres something in it for the spinners and the fast bowlers as well. The ball kept swinging the whole day, said Rahul.
If you spend some time in the middle its really good to bat on. All of us got starts but we couldnt convert.
But we are happy at the end of the day with 250-odd runs for six wickets. It wasnt really the worst day for us.
Ajinkya Rahane, standing in for injured skipper Virat Kohli, also looked set for a big score but ended up gifting a catch to Smith off Lyon for 46 made off 104 balls.
Ravichandran Ashwin (30) was adjudged lbw off Lyon. The all-rounder opted for a review but ball tracking showed the stumps would have been hit.
Ashwin hit four fours in his brisk 49-ball knock.
Lyon conceded 163 runs while taking just one wicket in the previous drawn Test at Ranchi. But the bowler, whose experience as a curator means he has a sharp understanding of pitches, brought Australia back into the game in the final session through some classic old-fashioned spin.
Lyons first victim was Pujara, who was coming into the match on the back of an epic innings of 202 at Ranchi.
Pujara tried to defend but the ball ripped back in to hit the glove and then lob up to short leg, where Peter Handscomb pouched an easy catch.
Pujaras 57 took his run tally past 400 in the series, behind only Smith who has 482 runs from seven innings.
The final session saw another gruelling contest between bat and ball, with the hosts scoring 95 for the loss of four wickets.
The Indians would have been in further trouble but for Matthew Renshaw who dropped two catches, much to the frustration of the toiling bowlers.
But the Aussies have the chance to run through Indias tail with the second new ball on Monday morning and grab the crucial first-innings advantage.
Day two also saw words being exchanged with long stares on a couple of occasions. But mostly the players remained within the bounds of good behaviour in what has otherwise been a fractious series.
Australia, who triumphed at home against India in 2014-15, need just a draw to retain the trophy. AFP

Mouth matters
Regional Dental Surgeon, Kandy and President of the Sri Lanka Dental Association (Kandy Branch) Dr.Uditha Pradeepa Herath speaks to T n'C about a commonly found dental disease - gum disease.
Q : What is Gum (Periodontal) Disease 
A - Gum disease is a very common condition where the gums become red, swollen, sore and infected. In Sri Lanka more than 90 percent of adults have gum disease to some degree and most people experience it at least once.
Gum or periodontal diseases can be divided into two groups according to the extent of the disease. If the disease is only in the superficial parts of the gum, not extending to the deeper parts of the gum tissues, it is called gingivitis which is reversible state whereas if the disease is extended to deeper tissues causing damage to the attachment of the gum tissue and tooth, it is periodontal disease which is an irreversible state.
Initial symptoms of the gum disease are redness, swelling and bleeding of the gum, usually healthy gum doesn't bleed during brushing. When the disease spreads further pain, pus discharging, bad breath, mobility of teeth and discomfort of biting will be experienced.
Main cause of gum disease is dental plaque which is a bio-film. Dental plaque formation is a constant process. It can be deposited and grown on teeth and gum. When the plaque is not controlled it damages the periodontal tissues by bacterial by products released by the plaque bacteria.
Diagnosis is mainly clinical. The initial sign of gum disease is bleeding especially during brushing. During examination of gum tissues red and swollen gums are noticeable.
Texture of the gum (orange peel appearance of normal gum) is changed. In advanced disease pus discharge, root exposure, sensitivity, pain and mobility of teeth followed by drifting and spacing between teeth are marked signs. At this stage patients complain of impaired functions of thtse teeth, inability to bite, pain on biting, swelling or abscess formation.
Q : What is the link between Gum disease and heart attacks, strokes etc
A - There are now several studies that seem to indicate that there are associations between cardiovascular disease and periodontal disease. Patients with periodontal disease have an increased risk of developing coronary heart disease relative to those without it. There are good evidences to indicate that relationship between gum diseases and atherosclerosis, in the presence of periodontal lesions there could be exacerbation of atherosclerosis leading to coronary artery disease.
Some studies have shown that periodontal disease is an independent risk factor for strokes. It has been shown that people with uncontrolled diabetes get periodontal problems more often and more severely and they loose more teeth than do person with good control of diabetes.
Q : What are the treatments available for Gum disease 
A -
(A) Maintenance of good oral hygiene is the best way to prevent gum disease.
Brushing your teeth is one of the easiest ways of maintaining good oral hygiene.
It is very important to select a correct brush, bristle of the brush preferably be flexible or soft, not the medium or hard bristled brushes. When the bristles are bent or distorted you should discard the brush.
Frequency of brushing is twice a day with lighter forces reaching each and every corner of teeth and gums with a fluoridated tooth paste.
(B) If you have bleeding gums it may be a sign of gum disease. It is advisable to consult your dentist soon. He will examine you and advise you the correct way of brushing, and if there are deposits cleaning and polishing your teeth will be done.
(C) If the disease has spread to the deeper tissues, it is necessary to intervene surgically.
But plaque control is very important in all these instances. It can be done either manually or chemically.
Manual plaque control methods are brushing and flossing.Chemical plaque control methods are mouth washes, gel and systemic antibiotics.
Q: How can we prevent these complications
A - Maintaining good oral hygiene is the best way to prevent gum disease. Gum disease is caused by plaque. Controlling plaque building up will control gum diseases.
It is important to have regular dental check ups so that any problems with your teeth and gums can be detected and treated early. If you never had gum disease and have good oral health, you may only need to visit your dentist every one or two years for check ups.
It is necessary to visit your dentist more frequently if you have had problems with the gum disease in the past. At each visit your dentist will advice when you need your next appointment. If you are in the category of increased risk of developing gum disease -for example, if you smoke or have diabetes, you are required to visit your dentist more often so your teeth and gums need very close monitoring.
Risk Factors for gum diseases
1. Plaque retaining factors (deposits, stains, bad fillings)
2.Mal aligned teeth (crooked teeth)
3.Faulty restorations, crowns, bridges
4.Appliances (denture, some Orthodontic appliances )
5. Medical problems (diabetes, leukemia, HIV/AIDS)
6. Hormonal changes in the body (pregnancy)
7. Smoking, betel chewing
Pregnancy and gum disease
Pregnancy causes hormonal changes that increase risk of developing gum diseases.
Varying hormone levels in the body, increased levels of progesterone in pregnancy may make it easier for certain gingivitis causing bacteria to grow, and also make gum tissues more sensitive to plaque and exaggerate the body response to the toxins that release by the plaque. If you are already having gum diseases, being pregnant make it worse.
Therefore if you are planning for a pregnancy maintain your oral hygiene well in advance.

CBSL hikes rates to curb inflation and credit growth
The CBSL raised policy rates by 25bps this week (SDFR: 7.25% SLFR: 8.75%), reversing its stance over the last 8 months of holding rates steady.
Policy rates, were last raised in July last year, and the CBSL cited that tightening of monetary policy was necessary as a precautionary measure to curtail inflationary pressure and possible acceleration of demand side inflationary pressure through excessive monetary and credit expansion.
CBSL believes current high inflation levels (CCPI 6.8% in Feb17 cf. 5.5% in Jan17) which is largely due to both supply-side pressures (weather disruptions and tax revisions) and demand driven pressures stemming from the growth momentum in economic activities particularly in construction related activities and services related activities (financial services insurance and telecommunication) to revert back to mid-single digit levels in the near term unless disrupted by adverse inflation expectations.
Simultaneously CBSL is also cautious of the slower than expected deceleration in monetary and credit growth that could result in demand side pressure in the near term, which also resulted in tightening of the monetary policy stance.
(Private sector credit growth which overshot the target of 20.0% Y-o-Y to end at at 21.9% Y-o-Y by Dec16 despite higher market rates (rates increased > ~500 bps in since Oct15) slowed down marginally to 20.9% Y-o-Y in Jan17)

Only two confirmed deaths had been reported due to Influenza AH1N1 from Sri Lanka so far and it is only a mild illness. Only the people in high risk categories, especially pregnant mothers should seek immediate medical treatment, Consultant Virologist of the Epidemiology Unit of the Health Ministry Dr. Samitha Ginige told the `Daily News yesterday.
According to Dr. Ginige, vulnerable persons such as elderly people (over the age of 65 years) or very young children (below the age of two years), pregnant women, postpartum mothers, people with suppressed immunity and those with chronic diabetes, chronic obstructive airways disease, heart, liver, kidney and metabolic diseases should seek medical advice from a qualified practitioner and follow the medical advice. Then they can prevent complications.
According to the Consultant Doctors, several viral diseases including Dengue, influenza and a viral fever with symptoms similar to Dengue are spreading rapidly in the country at present.
According to them one of the symptoms of viral influenza is that the platelet blood count reduces in some patients, but not as low as those afflicted with dengue. There is a risk of this condition developing into pneumonia in persons in high risk groups. But it is common for communicable diseases to spread in April and May and the public should not be panic.

Pan Asia Coloured Yarns awarded OekoTex  Standard 100 and ISO 9001:2008 Certification
Sri Lankas leading producer of Polyester and Nylon Yarn, Pan Asia Coloured Yarns (PACY) was awarded the highest grade of OekoTex Standard 100 certification following a series of stringent tests carried out at the Hohenstein Textile Testing Institute, Germany. At the same time the company was also awarded the only Independent Yarn Dyeing Plant to be certified by ISO 9001:2008/ SLS ISO 9001:2008 in Sri Lanka
The companys latest certification confirms the quality of PACYs products as being in full conformity with the strictest safety OekoTex standards, making its fabrics suitable for use for all types of clothing, including undergarments and for babies and toddlers. The standard is based on an increasingly stringent list of criteria relative to the intensity and frequency of skin contact with the product.
Test criteria and limit values in many cases go far beyond applicable national and international standards. Extensive product checks and regular company audits also ensure that the industry has a globally sustainable awareness of the responsible use of chemicals and dyes.
Pan Asian Coloured Yarns is currently the sole independent Yarn Dyeing House in Sri Lanka to have made the tremendous achievement of securing both OekoTex Standard 100 and ISO 9001:2008 Certifications. These quality certifications stand as a testament to our companys dedication to achieving production and product excellence.
Our latest certification has helped to further confirm PACYs position as a technically advanced and internationally competitive supplier to all leading manufacturers and exporters of fabric, garments, gloves and label manufacturers in Sri Lanka, PACY Factory Manager, M.N. Sheriff said.
PACY manufactures a wide range of Polyester and Nylon Yarn through the companys factories in Sapugaskanda and Ekala. The factories feature state-of-the-art laboratory facilities running advanced Dye to Match (DTM) capabilities and has, to-date, an archive of over 30,000 DTM colours for Yarn.
Moving forward, we are confident that Pan Asian Coloured Yarns unique ability to flexibly adjust to the varying requirements of our customers without having to demand minimum order quantities will add immense value to our clients, many of whom are themselves adopting Just In Time (JIT) practices. We are ready to supply 1kg to 10 Tonnes or more if required, PACY General Manager, Fayyaz Hamid stated.
Established in 1989, Pan Asia Coloured Yarns is a clear market leader in its segment, producing, processing and supplying yarn in excess of 40 tonnes per month.
With Sri Lanka on the cusp of GSP Plus restoration, the timing of these certifications could not be better for Pan Asia Coloured Yarns to strengthen their position in the supply and dyeing of Polyester and Nylon Yarn to manufacturers in Sri Lanka.

The Hambantota Port Concessionary Agreement has not been referred to the Parliamentary Oversight Committee, UPFA MP Chamal Rajapaksa said.
He said as of the standard practice, the Parliamentary Oversight Committee on Transport and Communication chaired by him should have been made aware of the content of the Agreement prior to approving it. He noted that he was not informed of the content of the Agreement despite his initial involvement in discussions to resolve the land related matters in Hambantota. I made a number of proposals in this regard, but I am yet to receive feedback, he said.
Commenting on the undervaluation of the lands, the MP pointed out that a special land valuation must be carried out in Hambantota, as the land value in the area has increased considerably over the past years.
The other problem is where to find alternative lands to resettle evacuated families. They cannot be simply asked to go elsewhere, he added.

Vying for the chance to handle citizens money are two major sets of players  the traditional banks, and a new age of Payments banks  organizations that have received licenses to run partial banks, where they can accept deposits, offer services like debit cards and remittances, but not provide loans (at least not yet). Its a battle between the old and the new that weve rarely seen the likes of elsewhere in the world.
Demonetization, arguably the most significant trigger of this race, was an involuntary exercise that the country underwent, where, overnight, the two largest currency denominations  The INR 500 and the INR 1,000 notes  were declared by the government as no longer being legal transacting tender.
Instead, the government would introduce a new set of INR 500 notes along with an entirely new denomination of INR 2,000 notes. INR 1,000 is approximately US $16, which in an Indian metropolitan city, would buy four movie tickets to a high-end cinema. Unfortunately, the execution of the exercise was patchy  there was a period of three months after the declaration of the old notes as illegal that the country was waiting for the new notes to be printed. The printing had begun during these months, but the demand far outstripped the supply, leading to daily cash shortages at banks and ATMs.
The move was initially portrayed by the Indian government as a way to combat undeclared income held privately by entities, outside of the countrys banking system, but when the move encountered criticism, the government changed the PR spin, reframing it into an effort to make India go cashless.
In hindsight, this was a good reframe of the exercise, because it shifted focus from the troubled execution of the demonetization exercise to an India of the future where transactions are digital (read: easy), and accounted for.
The payments banks offer interesting competition to the traditional banks because of the profile of companies that have received these licenses. Two such prominent licensees are the Indian telecom giant, Airtel (founded in 1995, $14.5 billion revenues in 2016), and the e-wallet + online payment facilitator PayTM (founded in 2010, valued by some sources at $1 billion, in its latest fund-raise, with controlling ownership held by Alibabas parent company).
E-wallets like PayTM have a straightforward operational model  Effectively, they act like PayPal with an online store and a network of offline retailers that customers can buy from.

Ronaldo takes Portugal tally to 70 in Hungary stroll
LISBON, Saturday: Cristiano Ronaldo scored two stunning goals and took his international tally to 70 as he led Portugal to an emphatic 3-0 win over Hungary in a World Cup qualifier on Saturday.
The Portugal captain scored from 25 metres after he was set up by an outrageous backheel from Andre Silva and smashed in a long-range free kick in the second half. Silva had opened the scoring from a move in which Ronaldo also played a part.
The win kept the European champions three points behind Group B leaders Switzerland who earlier beat Latvia 1-0 to maintain their 100 percent record with 15 points from five games.
Defeat left Hungary a distant third with seven points and only the slimmest of chances of their first World Cup appearance since 1986.
Portugal were nearly knocked out of Euro 2016 at the group stage by Hungary, having to come back three times to force a 3-3 draw.
But they had no such trouble this time despite a slow start in which Ronaldo shot over from a free kick and headed wide after Ricardo Quaresma's cross found him unmarked at the far post.
Just as coach Fernando Santos's decision to leave out Bernardo Silva appeared to be back-firing, Portugal went ahead.
Ronaldo released Raphael Guerreiro on the left and his low, first-time cross was turned in at the far post by an unmarked Silva in the 32nd minute.
Four minutes later, Pepe's long ball out of defence was met by Silva with a first-time backheel to Ronaldo who squeezed a low, left-foot between Peter Gulasci and the near post from 25 metres with stunning precision.
Brimming with confidence, Portugal's record scorer then tried to meet Joao Mario's dinked passed with a bicycle kick but did not get enough power behind the shot which Gulasci saved comfortably.
But he was not to be denied another goal and, inevitably, when Ricardo Quaresma won a free kick outside the area in the 65th minute, it was Ronaldo who took it. Repeatedly criticised during Euro 2016 for his record from free kicks, he made no mistake this time as he scored with a vicious effort which dipped over the wall and bounced in front of Gulasci.
It was his 70th goal for Portugal in 138 appearances.
The group looks increasingly likely to boil down to Portugal's match at home to Switzerland in October.
Only the winners of the nine European groups go straight to Russia next year while the eight best runners-up go into a playoff round for four more places.

Syria fighters 'take control' of IS-held airbase near Raqqa

A US-backed force of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters say they have taken full control of a key airbase held by the Islamic State group (IS) near Raqqa.
Its capture is seen as a significant step in the fight to drive the jihadists out of the city, which has become their de facto capital.
Talal Sello, a spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), said they had seized Tabqa airport from militants.
The Kurdish-led fighters are continuing to advance towards the city itself.
However, civilian rights groups have expressed safety concerns for citizens still living in the area.
The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said coalition air strikes have killed at least 89 civilians over the past week.
The capture of the military airport is the first major success for the SDF since the US-led coalition airlifted its fighters to place them behind IS lines last week, the BBC's Arab affairs editor Sebastian Usher reports.
The Tabqa airbase was seized by IS militants in 2014 from the Syrian army. The jihadists then carried out one of their worst atrocities - a mass execution of captured soldiers.
Its capture by SDF fighters was part of an offensive aimed at also taking control of the Tabqa dam - the largest in Syria - as well as Tabqa town.
Earlier, there was fears of serious flooding after IS warned that the Tabqa dam could collapse. However, the dam appears intact.
The US-led coalition denied the jihadists' claims that it had targeted the facility with air strikes, leaving it vulnerable to failure.
"The dam has not been structurally damaged to our knowledge and the coalition seeks to preserve the integrity of the dam as a vital resource to the people of Syria," a spokesperson told the BBC.
On Sunday there had been conflicting reports about damage to the dam - about 40km (25 miles) upstream of the Raqqa on the Euphrates river - with civilians reportedly fleeing to higher ground.
Although IS media channels warned the dam could burst, the militant group later reportedly sent cars around Raqqa with loudspeakers, telling people it was intact and they had no need to evacuate.
IS took full control of Raqqa in January 2014, and it has since become the capital of its self-proclaimed caliphate of land across Syria and Iraq.
Raqqa was Syria's sixth-largest city before the conflict, with a population of about 220,000. IShas banned civilians from leaving the city without permission, watching international TV, or talking by phone to anyone considered an enemy of IS, citizens inside have said.
IS forces in Raqqa are believed to have been swelled by thousands of jihadists who have left the Iraqi city of Mosul since it was besieged by Iraqi and coalition forces.
Aside from being strategically important and providing electricity to the region, the Tabqa dam complex is believed to be used as an IS headquarters where leaders plot attacks outside Syria, according to the Pentagon.
TheUnited Nations recently warnedthat damage to it could lead to massive-scale flooding.
There were similar concerns last year for a dam outside Mosul, an IS stronghold in northern Iraq.
If the Mosul dam burst, floodwaters could kill 1.47 million Iraqis living along the River Tigris, theUS embassy said. However, the dam has so far remained in operation.
US warplanes are supporting the Iraqi army's mission to retake Mosul from IS.
