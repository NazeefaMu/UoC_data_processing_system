Office of Missing Persons is necessary: JVP
	
A fully local permanent office was needed to provide redress to the relatives of missing persons, the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) said yesterday.
JVP MP Bimal Ratnayake, speaking during the debate on the Office of Missing Persons Act, in Parliament, said such an office was needed to mete out justice to the relatives of those who had gone missing during the past few decades.
There was unrest in the country in 1971, 1983, 1987-89 and 2009 to 2015, when a large number of politicians, artistes, journalists and civilians were killed or went missing, and no proper investigations were made regarding them. The commission appointed to look into the incidents of 1987 to 1989 had received information of 33,000 who had been killed and disappeared. A similar situation had taken place in the North. Therefore justice has to be done by the people in the North and the South, he said, emphasising that a permanent office of missing persons was necessary to mete out justice to everyone.
He said even the family members of JVP founder Rohana Wijeweera had not seen his dead body. He said the only known fact about Wijeweera was that he had made a public speech after his arrest.
However, Mr. Ratnayake suggested some amendments to the legislation -- such as that the power which the missing persons office had to sign MoUs with local and foreign bodies should be taken away.
He also suggested that the power which the office enjoyed to generate funds should be amended.
These two changes, he said, would make the office truly local. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

OMP Bill will be nullified under JO Govt: Dinesh
	
The joint opposition said yesterday it would consider the Office of Missing Persons Bill invalid because the due procedure was not followed in passing it and as such it would be nullified under a future government headed by it.
JO parliamentary group leader Dinesh Gunawardane said the Bill was put to a vote when a group of MPs were demonstrating in the Well of the House and that the quorum bill was not rung for the members to arrive in the Chamber to participate in the vote and under such circumstances the Bill could not be considered has have been enacted.
MP Vasudeva Nanayakkara said he was a member of the Oversight Committee that considered this Bill.
"I was opposed to the Bill being taken up for debate. Yet, my position was ignored. The committee used the majority approval to present its report in Parliament. There were two amendments proposed by the Committee. All of a sudden, we found 17 amendments by the government. I sought more time to study them. It was not given," he said.
Mr. Nanayakkara said the Bill would be declared null and void under a government headed by his party in future.
He said the Bill would provide for a hybrid judicial mechanism proposed by the government and though the findings of this Office would would not lead to criminal liability, its findings based on international expertise, would set the stage for action through such a mechanism in the near future Mr. Nanayakkara said the Office of Missing Persons would exercise police and judicial powers in one form or the other.

Both the Government and the Opposition should be ashamed of the events that took place in Parliament during the passing of the Office of Missing Persons Bill, Speaker Karu Jayasuriya said today.
He expressed these views in Parliament by referring to a story reported by some media on the chaos that took place inside the chambers when the Bill was taken up for debate. The Speaker said according to some media reports, some of the MPs were having a sing song session inside Parliament.
He said MPs should do what they do inside the lavatory inside the lavatory and not in the dining room. "Wesikiliye karana de kema kamaraye karranna epa," the Speaker told MPs.
The Speaker, who responded to the charges made by opposition members, said he gave them the opportunity of speaking at Thursday's debate but no one was interested. "I gave the joint opposition members an opportunity to speak. But they were not willing to return to their seats and remained in the well of the house shouting themselves hoarse," he said."Politicians should be aggressive and become revolutionists. But there are places such as Lipton's Circus and Hyde Park for such activities. They have to be restrained and act with decorum when in Parliament." (YP)

'Swiss Challenge Procedure' for unsolicited proposals: Govt.
	
The Cabinet has approved the use of what's known as the 'Swiss Challenge Procedure' in future to entertain unsolicited proposals for project implementation.
It is a system adopted by some countries when selecting private sector investors for this purpose.
This is a departure from the Government's assurance to follow the competitive bidding procedure to ensure transparency.
The Cabinet Paper says that it is a new selection process popular in many countries when selecting private sector investors to engage in development projects when proposals are presented by them without offers being called for by the government.
Then, other investors are called upon to make better offers than the original one and if a better offer is offered, the original investor is invited to match it. The Cabinet will draft the necessary guidelines to be followed in this regard. (Kelum Bandara)
