China's first nuclear submarine
	
Precious black-and-white footage showing China's first nuclear submarine being launched has been released by Chinese state media.?
The landmark warship Changzheng-1 tested the water nearly 50 years ago witnessed by passionate crowds as they applauded and hailed to the leadership of the Communist Party, which had by then ruled China for just over a decade.
The vessel was completed during the Chairman Mao era and when China was going through the turbulent decade known as the Cultural Revolution.
The video was released by China's state broadcaster CCTV on its Twitter-like Weibo after U.S. media last week reported that Beijing had tested a new submarine nuclear missile that could reach North America.
The clip was a part of a programme to mark the memorable achievements in China's military and industry since the founding of the People's Republic of China in 1949.
It was originally broadcast in April last year and was published on Wednesday again to celebrate the 48th anniversary of the launch of Changzheng-1, which was also known as the Type 091 submarine.?(Daily Mail)

Curry leaf ban: ?citrus greening? bacteria report in 2013 to blame: NPQS
	
The European Union (EU) has banned curry leaves from Sri Lanka based on a report published in a scientific journal about a ?citrus greening? bacterium which allegedly infected plants that came out in 2013, a senior official of the Department of Agriculture said.
National Plant Quarantine Service (NPQS), Additional Director Dr. W. A. R. T. Wickramaarachchi of the Department of Agriculture told the Daily Mirror the bacterium infection was reported in 2013 and it was published in many scientific journals.
?Based on those journal reports the EU amended its rules and came up with new regulations in 2014 with regards to the potential biodiversity threats which can have an effect on other countries. Before its 2014 update was finalised, the EU found this bacterium infection among plants of the citrus family. The ban was imposed for the protection of biodiversity in those countries,? Dr. Wickramaarachchi said.
?Candidatus Liberibacter Bacterium' agents were reported in our curry leaves at harvesting time. The curry leaf is a member of the Rutaceae family also known as the citrus family,? Dr. Wickramaarachchi said. However, he said a recent survey which was conducted showed that there are no ?citrus greening? bacterium infections.
?Based on the findings, new reports were published but it would take a long time to get the ban on Sri Lankan curry leaves exported to EU countries removed. We have already requested the EU to lift the ban based on this report. This is because 99.9 per cent of plant infections do not affect humans as is the case of this citrus greening bacterium disease,? Dr. Wickramaarachchi said.
He said Sri Lanka earns a huge revenue by exporting curry leaves and added that many Sri Lankan expatriates were in the habit of taking curry leaves with them when travelling abroad, including to EU countries, as curry leaves are associated with Sri Lankan tradition and food culture.
He advised the public not to take our plants, herbs and other items that effects biodiversity out of the country or bring them into the country without proper Quarantine National Plant Quarantine certificates.
He also advised the authorities not to publish any reports relating to Sri Lanka's biodiversity without proper supervision or authorisation as it might damage the image of the country.
Fresh curry leaves are no longer permitted to be exported from Sri Lanka to Italy, Cyprus, Greece and Malta because the citrus greening disease had already caused billions of pounds worth of damage to citrus trees in countries outside the EU. This decision has been taken to protect Europe?s fruit industry,? he said.
According to the final report of an audit carried out in Sri Lanka from February 3 to 13, 2015, the EU said new amendments of the directive such as that related to curry leaves, were not taken into consideration. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Fears of a second tsunami in Indonesia grow
	
?
Indonesia raised the alert level for the erupting Anak Krakatau volcano to the second-highest today, and ordered all flights to avoid the area, just days after it triggered a tsunami that killed at least 430 people.? ?
A crater collapse on the volcanic island at high tide on Saturday sent waves up to 16 feet (5 metres) high smashing into the coast on the Sunda Strait, between the islands of Java and Sumatra.? ?
Authorities have warned that the crater of Anak Krakatau, or child of Krakatau, remains fragile, raising fears of another collapse and tsunami, and have urged residents to stay away from the coast.? ?
The volcano has been rumbling on and off since July but has been particularly active since Sunday, spewing lava and rocks, and sending huge clouds of ash up to 3,000 metres into heavily overcast skies.? ?
The National Geological Agency, in raising the alert level to the second-highest, set a 5km exclusion zone around the island.?All flights?
are rerouted due to Krakatau volcano ash on red alert,? the government air-traffic control agency AirNav said in a statement.? ?
Kus Hendratno, a senior official at the Krakatoa observatory, said: ?We?ve raised the status of [the volcano] since this morning because there?s been a change in the eruption pattern.? ?

Flood situation in the North People being relocated as rescue missions conclude
	
?
December is a month that people always look forward to. From Christmas to New Year?s Eve, there are plenty of reasons to rejoice. But apart from these, for most Sri Lankans, December is a dark month. 14 years ago, the Indian Ocean tsunami swept away many lives that never returned. The impact of this disaster is felt to date. 14 years after, December once again made headlines with a sudden flash flood which affected several districts in the North. Although rescue missions have been completed, the families need to be relocated and most importantly, their lives need to be restored to normalcy.??
What is flash flooding?
Flooding that begins within six hours, and often within three hours, of the heavy rainfall (or other cause). Flash floods can be caused by a number of things, but are most often due to extremely heavy rainfall from thunderstorms. Flash floods can occur due to dam or lever breaks, and/or mudslides (debris flow). The intensity of the rainfall, the location and distribution of the rainfall, the land use and topography, vegetation types and growth/density, soil type, and soil water-content all determine just how quickly the flash flooding may occur, and influence where it may occur.??
Situation in the North
The flash flood in the North has affected 27,656 families and 86,695 individuals. In addition to that 86 fully constructed houses have been destroyed while 1,308 other houses have experienced slight damages. The affected families and individuals are being temporarily housed in 25 camps. Two deaths have been reported from Maradankeni, Jaffna and Kandavalai, Kilinochchi. The highest number of affected families have been reported from Kilinochchi and Mullaitivu districts. In addition to that, 85 individuals from Nanattan, Mannar and 501 individuals from Jaffna are also affected by the floods.With a heavy rainfall exceeding 300 mm areas including Pannankandi, Rathnapuram, Anandapuram, Ramanadapuram, Murusumottai, Ponnagar, Periyakulam, Thambirasapuram and Ulavanur have been affected. Speaking to the Daily Mirror, a few area residents said that the Sri Lankan Army has been involved in cleaning wells in these areas.? ?
Not a big issue that requires foreign aid : DMC?
?The existing flood was caused due to the accumulation of rainwater and it is not a big issue that requires foreign aid,? said Pradeep Kodippili, Deputy Director - Early Warning at the Disaster Management Centre. ?The situation is slowly returning to normal and we have already relocated 4000-5000 families. Those who have experienced severe damages will receive compensation up to 25 lakhs, depending on the severity of the damage.???
Rescue missions concluded: Army?
?We have completed all our duties and the rescued individuals are now in camps,? said Army Media Spokesman Brigadier Sumith Atapattu. ?We conducted rescue missions for three days and the responsibilities are now vested upon the civil administration.???
Six committees appointed to conduct assessments on damage : Kilinochchi GA
In his comments, Government Agent of Kilinochchi, Sundaram Arumainayakam said that six committees would be appointed to conduct assessments on the damage. ?So far, 22,000 families have been affected and 1642 families are in 17 welfare centres. We provide them with cooked meals, first aid, sanitary supplies and other necessary facilities and are looking after them. The six committees will report on the damage to houses, crops, livestock and infrastructure and I have asked them to submit the reports in one week?s time. So far the situation is under control and the weather conditions seem to be favourable as well. We have already started relocating the families and some of the welfare centres will be closed from today. I have to acknowledge the support extended by the Army and the Police to conduct the rescue missions.???

Govt. using underworld for its survival
	
The government is using the underworld for its survival, the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) said today.
MP Shehan Semasinghe said it was the duty of the government to ensure the safety of all citizens.
?Instead, the government is using the underworld for its own survival. Firearms are being used in broad daylight illegally. This year alone, 54 people have been shot dead. Six unidentified bodies had been found in five districts on Thursday. How can one say the security of the country has been ensured,? he said.
He said at a time when President Maithripala Sirisena had highlighted the importance of expediting investigations into the VIP assassination plot, Ministers Ranjith Madduma Bandara and Thalatha Atukorale had said there was no such plot.
The MP said the next year would be politically crucial.
?MP Range Bandara says he will make a decisive decision while Lakshman Wijemanna says he will even sacrifice his life. For what? These people are here not to serve the people but to get hold of portfolios. This government has to change,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. wants to create Sinhala-Muslim clash: Wimal
	
The incumbent government was anticipating a Sinhala-Muslim clash in the country so that it would pave the way for them to fulfil the promises made to the Tamil National Alliance (TNA), National Freedom Front (NFF) Leader Wimal Weerawansa said today.
Addressing a news briefing, he said it was evident that there was clear political hand behind the Digana incident and added that it shows how the government was plotting to create turmoil between the Sinhala and Muslim communities in the country.
?Prime Minster Ranil Wickremesinghe is now forced to fulfil the promises he made to the TNA. They always want to see the country in a crisis,? MP Weerawansa said.
?Therefore, it is obvious that there was a political motive behind the recent incident in Mawanella where several statues of the Lord Buddha were damaged,? the MP added.
Meanwhile, referring to the remarks made by Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara that there was no coup to assassinate President, he asked how the minister could be so sure of his stance when the investigations into the alleged coup were still underway. ?This raises a suspicion in my mind when he says this with such confidence although the police have not yet ruled out the possibility that a coup had been planned,? the MP said.

Harin clarifies gazette confusion
	
Minister Harin Fernando has cleared the confusion caused by Wednesday?s gazette notice issued by the President stating that Telecom, Digital Infrastructure, Foreign Employment Promotion and Sports Minister, Harin Fernando, and Development Strategies, International Trade, Science, Technology and Research Minister, Malik Samarasinghe, had resigned from their posts. Mr Fernando advised it was only a procedural matter.
?I have scarified the subject of Digital Infrastructure Development and allowed Ajith P Perera to be sworn in as the non-cabinet Minister in charge of the subject and as such cannot legally function as the Minister of Telecom, Digital Infrastructure and Foreign Employment Promotion anymore. However, I was sworn in as the Minister of Sports and Foreign Employment Promotion at the same time the Non- Cabinet Ministers were sworn in,? the Minister told Daily Mirror.
The Minister said the subject of Science, Technology and Research was given to Sujeewa Senasinghe and therefore Mr. Samarawickrama had to resign as the Minister of International Trade, Science, Technology and Research and was sworn in as Minister of International Trade. The Non-Cabinet Ministers would be in charge of the subjects given separately but would have to submit cabinet papers through the Prime Minister.? (Yohan Perera)

When this prominent politico was facing a formidable challenge to his high office, a group of his close loyalists called at his official residence to advise him to step down from the position in grace.
?
However, the scene that greeted the group on arrival at the familiar residence was something unexpected and it was terrifying too!
The boss in a terrific rage was dashing some files on the floor and screaming filth at domestic aides and family members.?
Whenever this politico loses his temper, he would dash on the floor whatever object he could lay his hands on and would bark at others using choice Sinhala filth, they say. The group of loyalists on the well-meant mission had hurriedly turned back fearing that the boss would vent his anger on them as well, they say.

ICAO compliance vital for NIC photos from Jan.1
	
It will be compulsory for all studios countrywide, from January 1, to use the special software provided by the International Civil Aviation Organisation (ICAO) to take photos for the National Identity Cards, the Department for Registration of Persons (DRP) said today.
DRP Commissioner General Viyani Gunathilaka said the pilot project launched in the Sabaragamuwa and the Western Provinces was successful and as such it was decided to launch the programme countrywide from January 1.
?Some 2,100 studios had been registered with the DRP and all of them have been provided with the ICAO software. The studios have been examined to check whether they maintain the standards in line with the software requirements,? the Commissioner said. "With the use of the software, a printed copy of the applicant?s details will be given with a bar-code reader instead of copies of printed photographs.
The applicant should be present at the studio to certify the printed copy before issuing it. The printed copy has to be handed over to the respective Grama Niladharis at the selected Grama Niladhari Divisions to be attached to the NIC application,? he said.
"The photo taken according to the parameters of the software will be transmitted to the DRP database for processing," the Commissioner said. (Chaturanga Samarawickrama)

Inhuman to deny safe drinking water
	
?
A manager of a certain zone in the Mahaweli development area in the Badulla district had suspended the pipe-borne water supply to several chronic kidney disease-affected families in the zone saying that they are not permanent residents there.
?
This manager, a son-in-law of a leading politico had decided to deny these families the safe water supply due to the presumption that they are not loyal to him, a resident said.?
The laying of a pipeline for the supply of water to one of the victimized families had been stopped by this manager while the work was underway.
?
The senior Mahaweli officials in the area have so far turned a deaf ear to the complaints being made by the affected residents as these officials fear to take any action against the manager because of the political clout he wields, they say.??

Karma and Death viewed from Vedic Astrology
	
?
All that live must die, passing through nature to eternity, says the great bard Shakespeare.
All great philosophers arisen in this world have expressed their thinking on the phenomenon of death and all religious teachers too have spoken about both death and the life after death.? Vedic Astrology too devotes an important part to death, the cause of death and life after death.?
?
Buddhism does not subscribe to fatalism, the belief that events are pre-determined by fate and you cannot prevent them from happening
Similarities between astrological principles and Buddha?s teachings
Most of our readers may find it interesting that astrological principles propounded by Maharishis in ancient India relating to death, Karma and rebirth are similar in many ways to what the Buddha has said on these subjects.? India?s great astrologer in recent times Prof. B. Suryanarayan Rao says in his celebrated work, Karma and Chemistry, that Astrology interprets what it conceives to be the future of man as moulded by his previous Karma indicated by the planetary positions at the time of birth.?
The fact that birth of a living being is determined by the force of Karma - the effects of good and bad he or she had done in his or her previous birth is in accord with the teachings of Buddhism.?
?
No place for fatalism in both Astrology and Buddhism?
Buddhism does not subscribe to fatalism, the belief that events are pre-determined by fate and you cannot prevent them from happening.? Astrology does not uphold fatalism either though some people seem to believe that fatalism is a hallmark of Astrology.?
According to famous Indian Jyotish Guru Dr. B. V. Raman Astrology does not recognize fatalism. He says in his work, ?Hindu Predictive Astrology?: ?Astrology should not be confused with fatalism? Ascertaining the length of life, the nature of death and the cause of death carefully before hand, it is possible to prevent many catastrophes and family strikes in this life and it is also possible to prolong the life if so desired by recourse to remedies prescribed by the ancient Maharishis.? Many times, the sudden death of a person leaves his widow, children and other dependents in a state of abject poverty??
?
What Astrology can predict
According to Dr. Raman, a careful study of a horoscope would show the cause and the source of death, the disease the native suffers from at the time of death.?
Unnatural deaths from drownings, tortures, accidents, attacks by wild beasts, suicide, murder etc. too could be foreseen and prevented by taking necessary measures.
Planetary positions at birth also indicate the period of unconsciousness before death, the nature of the cremation or the burial of the dead body, the nature of past and future births and the possibility or otherwise of attaining Moksha (final emancipation).

Lessons learned from a catastrophe - EDITORIAL
	
?
ri Lanka?s vulnerability to succumb to natural disasters was probably the pick among the topics spoken on Boxing Day (December 26) as the island commemorated the horrifying tsunami experience we had 14 years ago.?
The main commemoration programme this year was held at the Peraliya Tsunami Memorial in Thalwatte, Galle. As those affected by this tragedy, which happened in 2004, wiped away tears and remembered the dead on Wednesday, the people in the north are reported to be negotiating a flood situation which has caused havoc in several areas.?
All these issues point out that Sri Lanka as a whole is not prepared fully to face a natural catastrophe; especially when water is the mode of disaster.?
Sri Lanka?s Disaster Management Centre is vocal when there is a threat of a catastrophe; via floods or landslides. But the disparity that exists regarding what can be done and what is done eventually by the authorities puts us to shame.?
Sri Lanka?s tsunami story is riddled with guilt and shame. The islanders received ship loads of aid from donors in attempts made by the outside world to heal wounds, both physical and mental. But much of it went into the wrong hands as the island paid its price for not having an honest and efficient distributing system.?
Critics point out that if that aid was used properly Sri Lanka could have recovered fully from the damage caused and also saved some of it for future economic development. The questionable activities which took place at the Tsunami Aid Centres and the Help in Hambantota Project underscore the fact that we did have authorities who had hearts of stone.?
It didn?t come as a surprise when some organisations, knowing the set-up here, decided instead to take the tsunami aid to other nations affected by the tidal disaster.?
Back then the brunt of the damage caused by the tsunami was experienced by the people living in the north and the east. That was a time when the island?s northern and eastern parts were affected by the war against terrorism. The biography penned on the late Thamilini Jeyakumaran (An ex-tiger rebel) and titled ?Thiyunu Asipathaka Sevana Yata? gives an account of how the Sri Lanka Army and the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam were engaged in aiding those affected by the tsunami. According to the book there had been heated arguments between the two parties to the conflict when carrying out efforts to distribute aid items to those affected by the catastrophe.?
Even in the year that we Sri Lankans first came to learn about the tsunami, we showed that we were not prepared to work in unity.?
Now the call comes again from these same war-torn northern areas of the country which are submerged due to floods. The rains are reported to be less, but the people in areas like Kilinochchi, Jaffna, Mullaitivu, Mannar and Vavuniya district can?t still return to their homes.?
We have come to know that the Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe is preparing to visit these areas. As much as Rs 50 million has been set aside to offer aid to those people affected by the catastrophe; where the number given is in the range of 96,000.?
We are helpless when the impending disaster is greater than the technology we possess and our resolve to face it. Given the geographical placement of some areas of this island, their people are vulnerable to be effected by floods. This is a time when the initiative of the authorities must be carried out in full force. This is a time when the authorities must forget the past conflict and give with both hands the donations that have come from Government and Private collectives.??
It is heartening to hear that the Northern Province authorities have already taken the initiative to clean up drinking water resources in flood affected areas. This is vital to stop the spreading of waterborne diseases.?
The tsunami taught us that a catastrophe doesn?t distinguish between whether one belong to the majority or minority. When disaster strikes the pain is the same, regardless of who you are.?
Let the feeling of brotherhood spread as the flood waters recede.??

Michelle Obama takes 'most admired woman' title from Hillary Clinton
	
Former US first lady Michelle Obama has ended Hillary Clinton's 17-year run as America's most admired woman.
Mrs Clinton, ex-presidential candidate, secretary of state and first lady, came third in the annual Gallup poll, with talk-show host Oprah Winfrey in second.
The Queen finished in the top 10 for the 50th time, Gallup said.
Former President Barack Obama was the most admired man for the 11th year in a row. President Donald Trump finished second for the fourth consecutive year.
The poll has been carried out every year since 1946, with the exception of 1976.
The 1,025 adults surveyed were asked to name the man and woman living anywhere in the world whom they admire the most.
Mrs Clinton, a former US Democratic senator and secretary of state who ran for the White House in 2016, has come top of the list 22 times including the past 17 years in a row.
Although Oprah Winfrey has never finished top she has been second on 14 occasions.
If Mr Obama comes top again next year he will tie with the record holder - former president Dwight Eisenhower who won the most admired man title 12 times, Gallup said.
Mr Trump is, so far, one of only two presidents not to have won the title while in office, the other being Gerald Ford.
Gallup said the survey, which was carried out between 3-12 December, had a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points. (BBC)

?
Natural disasters hit the poor much harder than they do the better-off, so the poor should have priority when we reconstruct
This past week I?ve been acutely aware of what survivors in Indonesia were experiencing ? their bewilderment and agony
?
In October this year, The Guardian newspaper in the UK carried an article by Sri Lankan academic and author Sonali Deraniyagala on the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami that struck Indonesia in September 2018, claiming over 2000 lives.
In December 2004, Ms. Deraniyagala lost her family to the Indian Ocean tsunami, which claimed over 35,000 lives in Sri Lanka. The tsunami took away her two young sons, her husband, and her parents. Ms. Deraniyagala survived by clinging to a tree branch. In 2013, she released her award-wining memoir ?Wave?, which recounts her experiences in the tsunami and the intense grief she felt thereafter. ?Wave? is used as a prose passage in the O/Level English Literature syllabus.?
Daily Mirror republishes below the article by Ms. Deraniyagala, which appeared in The Guardian, in memory of the victims and survivors of the 2004 tsunami disaster, and the current tsunami tragedy affecting Indonesia?s Java and Sumatra islands.
?I cannot imagine what happened to you? ? people would often remark to me. I lost my world in the Indian Ocean tsunami of 2004. We were on holiday. I survived the deadly wave that struck the South Eastern coast of Sri Lanka. My two young sons, my husband and my parents did not.??
?I can?t imagine the horror of it,? I?ve heard people say this week as news of the Sulawesi earthquake and tsunami in Indonesia reached us. We heard about Rori, a 29-year-old woman who fled her home with her husband and baby daughter as the earth shook and the floor split and her mother got swallowed into the moving ground.??
We often stop ourselves imagining when confronted by the unthinkable. We do this out of respect, and also fear. We may think it too presumptuous to imagine the suffering of an individual like Rori. We are also afraid. But the truth is, we can imagine. And we need to. Not out of moral obligation, but because, really, none of us is that safe. And accepting this can be life-affirming, not scary. When we see that we are not so different from the people caught up in these calamities, we are not numbed by their stories. We can understand, and help.??
This past week I?ve been acutely aware of what survivors in Indonesia were experiencing ? their bewilderment and agony. In those early months after the tsunami I was immobilised on a bed, shaking, pain crushing my chest, clueless about what I should do now, how could I possibly live.??
How do we recover, as individuals, communities and countries? There is no blueprint for healing and rebuilding. Each situation is unique. But there are common challenges that we can understand, and imagine.??
Speed matters, when providing emergency help ? food, medicine, safe shelter. Rori?s daughter got a fever soon after the earthquake, she needed treatment ? a temperature so high is dangerous for a young child.??
Rebuilding infrastructure matters ? schools, roads. Devastation provides opportunity to modernise and make buildings safer. But it?s equally important to rebuild usefully and with imagination. This does not always happen. In Sri Lanka, I?ve seen new houses built after the disaster used only for storing rice ? people found the tsunami-resistant, dome-shaped new dwellings too bizarre to live in.??
Natural disasters hit the poor much harder than they do the better-off, so the poor should have priority when we reconstruct. In Haiti, mortality from the earthquake of 2010 was highest among the urban poor of the capital Port-au-Prince. The loss of assets ? farms, livestock, equipment ? can be ruinous.??
I know too that psychological support is crucial. Some weeks after the tsunami in Sri Lanka, I heard of a man whose children were killed by the wave. His took his own life, throwing himself under a train. With the right psychosocial help, he might have had a chance.??
With therapy I learned to tolerate the unbearable, and to process the unthinkable. And I was able to revive.??
Survivors in Sulawesi may be forever altered by this horrific geological event that caused the ground we assume to be safely solid to melt and liquefy. But they can recover and re-emerge. They can be happy and productive, and find meaning and joy again.??
My sons would have turned 21 and 19 this year. I often imagine how they would now be. Two of their friends from London are in Sri Lanka right now, volunteering on a project that teaches music to rural children who don?t have teachers or instruments. It was started up with donations after the 2004 tsunami. And more than a decade later ? when houses have been rebuilt and highways constructed ? it endures. It excites young children who thump their drums and blow their trumpets too loud. They are learning new skills. And are learning to imagine.??

## Title: Opposition Leader post: it is for the  UPFA,  not for the  TNA

Opposition Leader post: it is for the  UPFA,  not for the  TNA
	
The debate between the Maithri-Mahinda group and the United National Front over the Opposition Leader post is a best case in point with regard to the ridiculous level the Sri Lankan politics has stooped to. This has introduced a new but totally unnecessary Constitutional conundrum into the Sri Lankan politics.? ?
The Constitutional impasse that was brought in by the decision by President Maithripala Sirisena to sack Ranil Wickremesinghe from the post of Prime Minister and replace him with former President Mahinda Rajapaksa on October 26 was resolved by the Supreme Court on December 13 by its ruling against the dissolution of the Parliament. However, the political crisis that was created by the October 26 regime change is continuing and the row over the Opposition Leader post is an extension of it.? ?
President Maithripala Sirisena?s decision to change the regime or the October 26 Constitutional coup, as many people call it had paved the way for seven legal actions by various people. They were the case against the dissolution of Parliament, the case seeking a Writ of Quo Warranto against Mahinda Rajapaksa?s Premiership and his Cabinet, Sarath Weerasekara?s case against convening of the Parliament, the case seeking a Writ of Quo Warranto against the Parliament membership of Ranil Wickremesinghe, the contempt of court case against Speaker Karu Jayasuriya over convening of Parliament the contempt of court case against former Chief Justice Sarath N. Silva and the writ petition seeking an inquiry into the state of mind of the President.? ?
Of them, only one case, the case against dissolution of Parliament has been concluded, having a huge bearing on other cases as well and ending for some extent the 51 day political impasse. Yet, there are still possibilities of new political crises cropping up with the rulings on the other pending cases. It is against this backdrop that a new row over the Opposition Leader post has been brought to the fore.? ?
?
"The Constitutional impasse that was brought in by the President to sack RW from the post of PM and replace him with MR was resolved by the SC against the dissolution of Parliament. However, the political cisis is continuing"
Mahinda Rajapaksa was recognised as the Opposition Leader on December 18 by the Speaker following his resignation as the Prime Minister three days before, in the face of his inability to muster the majority support in Parliament. Then Tamil National Alliance (TNA) leader Rajavarothiam Sampanthan stated that he who had been holding the Opposition Leader post for three years had not been removed from the post by anybody and therefore he was still the Opposition Leader. He also said that in the light of the recognition of Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Opposition Leader, there were two Opposition Leaders in Parliament.? ?
Along with this law point by his leader, TNA Spokesman M.A. Sumanthiran also dropped a bombshell by arguing that Mahinda Rajapaksa and some of his loyalists have lost their Parliament membership as they have obtained the membership of the Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) a month ago. He quoted the Constitution as saying ?Where a member of Parliament ceases by resignation, expulsion or otherwise, to be a member of a recognised political party or an independent group on whose nomination paper his name appeared at the time of his becoming of such member of Parliament, his seat shall become vacant upon the expiration of a period of one month from the date of his ceasing to be such member.?? ?
?
"In the light of the recognition of MR as the Opposition Leader, there were two Opposition Leaders in Parliament"
"TNA Spokesman Sumanthiran by argued that MR and some of his loyalists have lost their Parliament membership as they have obtained the membership of SLPP a month ago"
This prompted a frightened Rajapaksa and his group in the House to unashamedly deny that they obtained the membership of the SLPP. Their audacity to tell the people such a diabolical lie despite the whole country having watched them in TV getting the membership of the SLPP was amazing. SLPP National Organiser and Rajapaksa?s brother Basil Rajapaksa said that though members of the SLFP including his brother applied for the membership of his party, they had not been given it yet.? ?
It was on November 11, amidst the post dissolution constitutional gridlock that Rajapaksa obtained the membership of the SLPP from its Chairman Professor G.L.Peiris and his loyalists in turn got it from him.? ?
When the UPFA members in Parliament said that they, including Rajapaksa were still the members of the SLFP and the UPFA, Sumanthiran dropped another bombshell questioning as to how the members of the party headed by the President who is also the head of the Cabinet can be the members of the Opposition. In spite of Pivithuru Hela Urumaya leader Udaya Gammanpila having answered this question citing precedents in history, the Mahinda loyalists seemed to be perplexed by Sumanthiran?s question.? ?
?
"MR?s and his group?s denial that they obtained the membership of the SLPP was amazing"
"The power struggle manifested through the 51 day Constitutional and political impasse had brought the State machinery to a standstill position"
Yet, Sumanthiran seems to be wrong in his both arguments. The Constitution says one would lose his Parliament membership only if he lost the membership of the party through which he was elected or appointed to the Parliament. It does not say that he is no longer an MP if he obtained the membership of another party. Therefore, one can be an MP so long as he is a member of his original party, despite him becoming member of any number of other parties.? ?
Fortunately for Rajapaksa and his loyalists, they had not been removed from the membership of the UPFA, the party through which they were elected and appointed to the Parliament, for obtaining the membership of the SLPP. UPFA General Secretary, Minister Mahinda Amaraweera, after this issue cropped up had informed the Speaker that Rajapaksa and his loyalists were still the members of his party. Therefore, Rajapaksa, the Kurunegala District MP and his group seem to be out of danger.? ?
Even if they lose the membership of the Parliament, another set of UPFA members would replace them, maintaining the status of the UPFA as the main Opposition party. They would then again be able to lay claim to the Opposition Leader post.? ?
And, as Gammanpila cited from history, despite the President Constitutionally being the head of the Cabinet, his party had been in the Opposition and one of the members of his party had been the Opposition Leader for four times in history. It was Gamini Dissanayake who held the Opposition Leader post during President D.B. Wijethunga?s tenure, after the General Election in 1994. President Chandrika Kumaratunga appointed her party stalwart Ratnasiri Wikramanayake as the Opposition Leader in 2001 and in 2015, when Maithripala Sirisena won the Presidential Election, Nimal Siripala de Silva was appointed Opposition Leader.? ?
In spite of there being a moral issue in the President being the head of the Cabinet while his party is in the Opposition, it has been history, apart from the Constitution having sanctioned it.?
?
"The Constitution says one would lose his P?ment membership only if he lost the membership of the party through which he was elected or appointed to? P?ment. It does not say that he is no longer an MP if he obtained the membership of another party"
A party cannot be the ruling party just because its leader is the President of the country, as it would lead to situations where the party with the majority power might become the Opposition.? ?
Sampanthan may not be removed yet from the post of Opposition Leader. But he is well aware that he does not command the confidence of the Opposition, after October 26. The TNA opposed Mahinda Rajapaksa?s recent appointment to the post of Prime Minister on the ground that he did not command the confidence of the Parliament.?
Then, how can it be appropriate for Sampanthan to lay claim to the Opposition Leader post when he does not command the confidence of the Opposition?? ?
The power struggle manifested through the 51 day Constitutional and political impasse had brought the State machinery to a standstill position. Prolonging the power struggle through more Constitutional issues would not in any way be in the interest of the people.? ?

Rights groups request Prez to release lands by Dec.31
	
The People?s Alliance for the Right to Land (PARL), in a letter to the President had urged him to keep his promise to release all lands in the North and East by December 31, 2018. The letter has been signed by 47 displaced persons from the North and East and endorsed by 132 concerned individuals and organisations.?
?Many of the displaced communities from the North, are also currently facing great hardship because of the recent floods, resulting in further displacement, damage to property and possessions and the destruction of their paddy lands and the resultant loss of livelihoods. Particularly, in light of their continued suffering, we have called upon the President, to fulfil his promise to the people and let them return home in time to usher in the New Year.? On October 4, 2018, the Presidential Media Division reported that, President Maithripala Sirisena had instructed the authorities to complete the process of releasing the lands in the Northern and Eastern Provinces to their original owners before December 31 after resolving all outstanding issues.
We, whose lands have been taken away from us forcibly and are still suffering immensely nearly ten years after the end of the war, demand that you keep this promise and ensure that authorities abide by instructions you gave them several months ago.? ?
We also demand that the Prime Minister and leaders of all political parties and alliances support this fully and demand that the President implement this decision.? ?We appreciate that the government has released some occupied lands to different communities in the last several years, but are deeply disappointed that there has been inadequate resettlement assistance and other restrictions and obstructions they have faced which have hampered their resettlement.? ?
To assist you, we attach a short briefing and summary of 15 cases (not exhaustive) that was submitted to the government on August 29, 2018, by the People?s Alliance for Right to Land (PARL) after a discussion on land held at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute on August 21, where representatives of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also participated.

?Season?s Greeting? for another New Year in ?Crisis?
	
?
Three more days and another new year; 2019 would dawn with sky rockets, firecrackers and ?31st Night? bashes in Colombo. For the fun loving urban middle class, the Constitutional crisis, the threat on ?democracy? there was a month ago, is no more. For them, it?s yet another New Year with grand expectations; joy, good health, peace and prosperity. No different to the sky rockets, firecrackers, barbecues, beverages, music and dancing of yesteryears and what was wished for one year ago and every year before that.? ?
Beneath all that fun and frolic in the city the political crisis festers into 2019. A scary situation, a crisis that demands alternate answers to resurrect a new ?democratic? State in place of the present corrupt and the crumbling. This crisis is many faceted. From Ministry Secretaries, Department heads to District Secretaries and down to Grama Niladharies, the whole State administration is corrupt and inefficient. The Police Department needs serious reforms to turn it into a civil department with public acceptance and trust. Independence and integrity of the judiciary is lot more than a ?historic decision? of the SC that pleases the urban social activists. Clean and efficient it has to be, to be independent. The free market economy has topped all that with heavy corruption and growing disparities between urban and rural life.? ?
Answers don?t come with blind faith on individuals. Getting back to an insanely corrupt parliament on a SC ruling is not getting back to ?democracy?. All political parties represented in parliament led by autocratic leaders represent ?wheeler dealers? growing out of this free market economy. Such political parties don?t take principle positions on any issues.They work on cheap, populist slogans instead. Free market economies are not only inherently corrupt, they also breed ethno-religious extremism.That?s one major reason the Tamil National Question remains unresolved this long though ITAK leaders would continue to believe in these leader seven after the New Year dawn.? ?
Within all that the liberty to roam for employment and to decide and choose his or her basket of goodies came to be interpreted as ?freedom and democracy?. The ?free and open market? with a growing urban middle class struggling to increase its purchasing power too is being showcased as ?development?. The rural folk, that?s 70.4 per cent of the population of this country, Sinhala, Tamil and Muslims all included, live in the periphery of the slow moving and almost stagnant market. They lack ?buying power? to be of any worth in this consumer society. Buying power is not ?purchases? of the poor who ?buy to live?. ?Buying power? is the ?extra rupee? of the urban middle class who spend on extra comfort. It is therefore not just cash flow and profits that decide poverty in neo liberal economies. It?s the marginalising of rural life, the neglect of State funded priority services like education, health and public transport that defines poverty.? ?
Within that lopsided market,?poverty alleviation? is a crude game of numbers. ?Poverty line? drawn around Rs.4,000 per person per month claims Sri Lanka?s poor is around 5.0 to 6.0 per cent while the ?Household Income & Expenditure Survey? by the Census & Statistics Department says an urban family of 04 needs a monthly income of Rs.58,930 for basic living while in rural society it is Rs.38,274 per month. Over decades, this has also created a growing and a gnawing disparity with 20 per cent of the population enjoying 52.6 per cent of the per capita income, leaving the majority with little or no access to basics in life.? ?
?
"Import of vehicles should be restricted giving preference strictly for public transport and other productive use, to ease growing traffic congestions"
Yet within this ?free for the filthy rich? market economy, no government can plan for sustainable economic growth with equal opportunities and access to social benefits. Planning in a free market economy is about opening up for more and more investors. This leads to increasing restrictions on access to health, education, public commuting, access to markets and cultural and intellectual life. Break down of moral and social values are unavoidable accompaniments. We thus have to re define ?development? People need for a ?contended life?. Not only in terms of material purchases but also in terms of ?cultural and intellectual life?.? ?
Sketch for ?2019 Manifesto?
?Development? defined for a contended life, we need to work on a ?National Policy on Socio Economic Development? that should include,? ?
A. Education - reforms seriously thought and planned for pre, primary, secondary, tertiary, university and post university higher education including adult education. Curricula should focus on cultural and secular life. ?Free education? to be defined in terms of marginalised, the poor and the less privileged. In-service training and regular knowledge improvement/advancement for teaching profession needs inclusion, making teaching a socially respected profession at the high end.? ?
B. Health - needs overall change in perception from ?curative health? to ?preventive community health?. Major focus to gradually reduce patients seeking treatment in hospitals. Curative health needs strong referral system across both State and private sector. Preventive health sector personnel should have improved modern training.Regular eye, dental and ENT clinics should be compulsory as State responsibility from pre-school to Grade V; 10 years in a child?s life. Focus being to produce a healthy future generation.? ?
C. Public transport ? government to take full responsibility for an efficient, affordable and a comfortable public service. Import of vehicles should be restricted giving preference strictly for public transport and other productive use, to ease growing traffic congestions. City commuting should have efficient linking between rail and bus transport to reduce individual private vehicles entering cities. Schools should promote bicycle travel with pupils resident within 02 km enrolled to public schools and all ?school service? vehicles banned.? ?
D. National economy - should be ?people driven? and not ?investor? driven. Should be planned with a guarantee on a ?minimum national wage? for ?decent work?. Economy to be regulated, with focus on the South Asianmarket. Rural economy should be planned to greatly reduce migration in search of employment to cities and Mideast. Economic planning should accommodate adequate green canopy in all cities, guaranteeing a forest cover not below that in 1990,with guarantee on wetland and coast conservation.? ?
E. Agriculture - requires a wholly different approach to subsidised farming. Subsidised paddy farming in the dry zone needs rethinking.It leaves labour idling for half the year and large tracts of seasonally underutilised land. Complete neglect of post-harvest technology for most agri-products denies stabilised market prices throughout the year with glut harvests leaving farmers at the mercy of middlemen.? ?
F. Cultural and intellectual development ? economic development should facilitate the development of a culturally advanced Citizen. All development planning thus should include modern facilities in all provinces for modern museums on different subjects, modern and multidimensional libraries, fully equipped auditoriums, theatre halls and also recreational centres and parks for both children and adults.? ?
G. Media ? State media should be taken out of ministerial authority and placed under an independent public authority. Unlike private print media, all electronic media using digital frequency spectrums should be regulated for social responsibility. An independent authority should be responsible for short term lease of digital frequencies and their terms and conditions in detail, made public.? ?
The ?challenge? is to create an?
inclusive ?State? that can bear responsibility for such a broad and complex new approach for ?development? with a paradigm change. The problem lies with the Sri Lankan State. It was conceived, established and improved upon by the British over a period of about 130 years as a ?Unitary? State. When Ceylon was handed over to the Colombo elite as an independent State, centralising was structured and firm, centred in Colombo. That centralised colonial State was re fashioned as a Sinhala Buddhist Unitary State by both the UNP and the SLFP leaderships. In the first parliament, the UNP government disfranchised and turned plantation Tamil labour into ?Stateless??wage earners.? ?
Usurping of power by Sinhala Buddhist leaderships continued with Sinhala made the only official language in 1956. The first Republican Constitution in 1972 made certain the Sinhala Buddhist Unitary State remained further strengthened by fostering the Buddhist Sangha as a privileged religious clergy (Chapter 02 Article 09 says the State as a duty will protect and foster the ?Buddha Sasana?, ie., the clergy). This allowed the Colombo centred governments to directly patronise Buddhist monks who became a legitimate political factor in the Sinhala South. The Colombo centred Sinhala Buddhist Unitary State since independence reveals how ?development? has left the rural Sinhala people marginalised.? ?
The lesson learnt is, a ?Centralised Unitary State?, would leave ?development? as a privilege of the Colombo centred urban life.Development should ensure ?a fully contented life to all Citizens with dignity, peace and stability?.? ?
?
What could then be the alternate model? A way out would be to,? ?
1. Have a carefully regulated open market that will not turn citizens into screaming consumers in an atomised society? ?
2. Shift investments to planned and identified economic sectors with strict conditions laid down for employment and safeguards on employee rights? ?
3. Restructure local government and provincial councils as participatory democratic organs of governance? ?
4. Ensure public policy making is open and participatory and is adopted within a national development plan? ?
All or most of these would need a new Constitution dialogued in society, consented to and approved by the people. I would propose the APRC Final Report (accessed here - http://www.groundviews.org/wp-content/uploads/July-20-APRC-Final-Report.pdf?x98647) as the main ?discussion document? for 2019 to have all its ?Greetings and Good Wishes? worthy of the year.? ?

Sheikha Latifa: Mary Robinson 'backed Dubai version of events'
	
Former UN rights chief Mary Robinson has been accused of supporting the emirate of Dubai's version of events over a princess who was feared missing.
Mrs Robinson, who recently met Sheikha Latifa, daughter of Dubai's ruler, said she was a "troubled young woman".
She told the BBC the princess regretted making a video in which she alleged confinement and torture.
Radha Stirling, head of the rights group Detained in Dubai, said questions remained about the princess's welfare.
"Anyone familiar with Princess Latifa's story who listened to the BBC Radio interview today with Mary Robinson will be astonished at the extent to which Mrs Robinson appeared to be reciting almost verbatim from Dubai's script," she said.
"What we heard today was Mary Robinson essentially reciting for BBC Radio listeners the content of the statement issued by the Dubai ruler's court."
She added: "This meeting in no way satisfies me that she [Sheikha Latifa] is free from the abuse that she told me she had suffered for years."
Sheikha Latifa, the daughter of the emirate's ruler Sheikh Mohammed Bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is said to have tried to flee abroad in March in order to live a freer life.
But campaigners say the luxury yacht she was fleeing on was intercepted off India, and she was forcibly returned to Dubai, one of the United Arab Emirates (UAE).
A video emerged in which the princess said she and her family "did not have freedom of choice" in their lives. She also alleged she had been imprisoned for three years and tortured on her return.
The UAE denied the reports and said Sheikha Latifa had been living at home with her family.
But when the princess was not heard of for months, international human rights groups asked the authorities to prove her safety.
On Monday, the UAE foreign ministry said it had sent a communiqu? regarding Sheikha Latifa to the UN human rights office.
UN High Commissioner for Human Rights and former president of Ireland, and were purportedly taken on 15 December in Dubai.
Mrs Robinson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she had been invited by Princess Haya, wife of Dubai's ruler, to "help with a family dilemma".
"The dilemma was that Latifa is vulnerable, she's troubled. She made a video that she now regrets and she planned an escape, or what was part of a plan of escape," Mrs Robinson said.
"I had lunch with her. She's a very likeable young woman but clearly troubled, clearly needs the medical care that she is receiving."
Mrs Robinson said the princess was suffering from "a serious medical situation" and receiving psychiatric care, but did not give further details. She said her family didn't want her to "endure any more publicity".
The group Detained in Dubai legally represents two people who say they were attacked and abducted while trying to help the princess escape.
Ms Stirling said Mrs Robinson "had nothing to say" about the accusations Sheikha Latifa had made against her father.
"She said nothing about Latifa having planned her escape for nearly a decade, nor anything about her previous escape attempt," she said.
"She said nothing about the illegal raid of Latifa's boat in international waters and the fact that she was screaming for asylum and begging to not be returned to the UAE. Mrs Robinson simply repeated again and again from the official Dubai statement that Latifa is in the 'loving care of her family' and that the whole issue is nothing more than a 'family matter'."
Another rights group, Guernica 37 International Justice Chambers, also said it was concerned by Mrs Robinson's comments.
"Mrs Robinson appears to have spent a couple of hours with Sheikha Latifa, and despite having no formal medical or psychiatric training, has somehow diagnosed her condition and concluded that she is receiving appropriate treatment. It is unclear on what basis Mrs Robinson considers herself qualified to do so," it said in a statement. (BBC)

SL student's case - Aussie cricketer Khawaja's brother re-arrested
	
Arsalan Khawaja, the brother of Australian cricketer Usman Khawaja, has been re-arrested on charges of trying to influence a witness in a case in which a Sri Lankan student was arrested and charges dropped later in a fictitious terrorist plot, foreign media reported.
Sri Lankan student Mohamed Kamer Nilar Nizamdeen spent four weeks in jail after being charged with creating a document in connection with preparing for a terrorist act. Nizamdeen, 25, was released on bail in late September and charges were dropped.
Arsalan was previously arrested and released on bail in early December on condition he surrenders his passport and reports to police three times a week.
Arsalan was pulled over while driving in Sydney on December 4. He was charged at the Parramatta Police Station, in Sydney's west, with forgery by making a false document, attempting to pervert justice and lying to police.
Arsalan was re-arrested on Thursday "after allegedly attempting to influence a witness" in the counter-terror investigation, news agency AFP quoted a New South Wales state police spokeswoman as saying.
The 39-year-old has been charged with breaching his bail conditions and influencing a witness. He was refused bail ahead of his appearance in a Sydney court later on Friday.
The notebook, belonging to 25-year-old Sri Lanka-born PhD student Mohamed Nizamdeen, was discovered in an office in the university at the university.
Police allege Khawaja and Nizamdeen were rivals for the affection of the same woman, leading Khawaja to devise the plot which led to his arrest on Tuesday.

Some UNPers not in favour of general elections
	
A faction of the United National Party (UNP) is said to be opposed to a snap parliamentary election next year.
This comes in the wake of UNP National Organiser and Minister, Navin Dissanayake having said he had proposed to the party leadership to prepare for a snap general election after April next year.
However, some UNP MPs are not in favour of this proposal and instead are demanding a snap presidential election. According to the Constitution, President Maithripala Sirisena can declare a snap presidential election after he completes four years in office on January 8, 2019, so as to seek a fresh mandate for a second term.

Trump?s surprise troop visit sparks criticism in Iraq
	
BAGHDAD AFP Dec27, 2018? -? President Donald Trump?s lightning Christmas visit with US troops in Iraq has triggered questions and criticism in a country deeply divided over Washington?s influence since the 2003 US invasion.? ?
The Wednesday visit, Trump?s first with US troops in a conflict zone since he took office two years ago, came days after a shock decision to pull all American troops from neighbouring Syria.? ?
?What was supposed to pass for a face-saving story-- that Trump refused to meet the PM in Baghdad insisting that the meeting take place at the Ain Al-Asad base-- was viewed by many Iraqis as further proof of Trump?s contempt for Iraq,? said Fanar Haddad, an Iraq expert at the National University of Singapore?s Middle East Institute.? ?
Former Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi said the way in which Trump visited Iraq was ?not commensurate with diplomatic norms and relations with sovereign states?.? ?
??Dealing with Iraq and its sovereignty in this way will harm Iraqi-US relations,? he said.? ?

When children suffer from Asthma
	
?
Children are the most precious gift that parents ever have. That?s why when children are suffering from a minor ailment, parents try to consult a doctor in order to bring the child back to normalcy. So in this week?s Health Capsule we focus on the most shared disease among children; asthma. It is a known fact that asthma affects both the young and old alike. In other words in any stage of life, one can suffer from asthma. But with regard to children, it is a different matter. Since children cannot verbally express the real symptoms of their illness, the situation can be worse. Therefore as a parent, your responsibility is to keep an eye on the slightest change that the child shows.
?
What is asthma?
Health Capsule was able to contact Consultant Paediatrician at the Lady Ridgeway Hospital for Children,? Dr. Deepal Perera to further discuss about Asthma and on how the disease could affect a child?s health. According to him, asthma is a chronic air way obstruction disease. ?When a child is diagnosed with asthma it is interpreted as childhood asthma. It is obvious that the human respiratory system performs the role of carrying air in and out. But in asthma, exhalation is difficult; a process that involves air being carried into the lungs and? breathed out. With asthma, a child finds it difficult to breath because of problems associated with the air way. Asthma is the lack of exhalation and as a result a child tries to breathe faster. In that way, the oxygenated level of a child rises and as a result a child?s accessories muscles such as intercostal muscles become active.
The speciality of childhood asthma is that when the child reaches the age of 12 or 13 years this condition normally subsides. But if the child is exposed to provoking factors of asthma, the disease might continue to prevail? Dr. Perera said. According to the doctor, if the condition worsens, the patient is vulnerable to a severe asthma attack. During a severe asthma attack, both inhalation and exhalation become difficult.?
?
Causes?
Asthma is a multi-factorial disease. Fundamentally there are two grounds for childhood asthma, which can be characterised as genetic and environmental background.
1. Family history or genetic background- The family history has a countless influence on childhood asthma. It is evidently proved that parents? genes pass on to their children, so if a child has a family history of asthma, it naturally passes to the child.
2. Environmental background- The major portion of asthma is in the environmental background. This includes many factors such as exposure to dust and vapours, smoking, drug allergies and also exposure to animals. Let?s looks at some of these factors in detail.
?
?Exposure to dust and vapour- This is the prominent cause for asthma disease. Since we are living in an industrialised era, each and every day we are exposed to dust and vapour. So your child inhales all these and as a result gradually? becomes a victim of childhood asthma.
	Smoking- Smoking is another very imperative negative factor of asthma. Although a child doesn?t engage in smoking, they play the role of a second smoker when they are near a smoker. You may not take these minor factors? seriously, but they eventually become a great threat to the child?s life.?
	Exposure to animals- A small child can easily be fond of? animals such as cats and dogs. But it will be a great menace to a child?s life, when he or she constantly spends time with such animals; specially with cats and dogs. Pet dander is not good for the child.?
Smoke emitting from fire and drug allergies are other factors that could trigger childhood asthma.?
?
How to recognise childhood asthma?
As a parent your foremost responsibility is to take care of the child?s health.? Symptoms of asthma can vary from child to child. But if your child is continually suffering from symptoms such as coughing, wheezing and shortness of breath, parents should take serious note of such conditions. According to Dr. Perera, the major symptom of asthma is coughing. Night time coughing is a major indicator of childhood asthma. Also, if the child coughs while engaging in any physical activity such as running, it can be categorised as another symptom of asthma. Wheezing on the other hand, is another negative aspect of asthma. ?Wheezing is only one episode in bronchial asthma. Shortness of breath is also another visible symptom of childhood asthma. If your child complains of minor chest pain, that may be the beginning of childhood asthma. Also, if your child starts wheezing when exposed to the above mentioned? factors, it is the best time to seek? medical advice? he said.
?
Can asthma be cured forever?
When inquired about ?curing? asthma, he said that the disease can be ?controlled?.? If any child is suffering from childhood asthma, the only thing that can be done is to control the triggering factors of asthma. ?For the treatment of asthma in children, doctors prescribe the use of? inhalers and other suitable drugs according to the phase of childhood asthma. If the child is suffering from an acute attack of asthma, doctors may instruct the patient to opt for the long-term use of? inhalers? Dr. Perera added.
?
Message to parents
Children differ from one another. They have their own characteristics. According to the doctor, ?parents panic when inhalers are prescribed for children suffering from asthma. Parents assume that it is prescribed for long-term use. Simply they don?t understand their child?s health condition. Because if the child has a severe asthma condition, doctors treat them accordingly. So as parents, you must understand the state of your child?s health and take necessary initiatives accordingly? Dr. Perera concluded.

## Title: Will take tough decision if Cabinet post not given: Range Bandara

Will take tough decision if Cabinet post not given: Range Bandara
	
Puttalam District Parliamentarian Palitha Range Bandara warned that he would be forced to take a tough decision if he was not given a Cabinet portfolio by next month. He pointed out that he was the catalyst behind the rise of the United National Party following the recent Constitutional impasse.
He made these comments yesterday at a ceremony organised to hand over equipment to the people in Siyambalawewa in line with the Gamperaliya programme.
The MP added that wherever he went people would say, ?Range Bandara is a genuine person who lives by his word and does not waver. They also say I am the catalyst for the attempt to rejuvenate the UNP. A month has passed since the Cabinet was formed, however, to date Range Bandara has not been given a Cabinet post.?
He said it all began when he went to Japan for an official visit. While he was there the Secretary of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) Mahinda Amaraweera made a statement claiming the members of the SLFP in the unity government had decided to pull out. Two hours later, a new Prime Minister was appointed.
At the same time, a leading figure in the country called and offered me a Cabinet post along  with Rs.500 million. Thereafter, I received another call from a leading figure in the SLFP asking me to join them and promising that all I ask for will be given to me if I do. However, I did not join them. I did not leave the party. That is how I acted. I later learnt that many of our members were called. However, as a man with a backbone, I refused and even revealed everything that took place to the party and the public. I am received with hugs and kisses by my adoring public but now they are beginning to inquire what I have been given by the party for being straightforward and loyal. They also ask why I did not accept the money and the minister-ship that I was offered to join the new government that was formed by the previous regime. I have to take a serious decision on behalf of the Puttalam people. If this problem is not resolved in the early part of next year, I will have to take a tough decision in this regard.
I am determined to sit in the Cabinet in order to solve the people?s problems such as education, health and others. The people have come forward to stage a fast or protest on my behalf. I have calmed them down and asked them to be patient for a little while longer. The people know about Range Bandara and the service done by me on their behalf,? he said. (Hiran Priyankara Jayasinghe)
