Court dismisses petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries
	
The Court of Appeal dismissed with costs the writ petition filed by Perpetual Treasuries Ltd seeking the cancellation of the Monetary Board directive limiting the transactions carried out by the company and its two subsidiaries.
The Court of Appeal Bench comprising Rohini Walgama and S. Thurairaja decided to uphold the preliminary objection raised by the Attorney General on the maintainability of the petition on the basis of it being technically flawed.
Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, a primary dealer specialising in the intermediary government security market, had filed a Writ Petition before the Court of Appeal seeking an order quashing the directions of the Monetary Board imposing restriction on it.
Senior Counsel for Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd S.A. Parathalingam, when the matter came up for mention, brought to the notice of the court that the impugned directives expired on March 31 and fresh directives have been issued by the Central Bank and said directives did not cover all the subject matters.
He moved to withdraw the petition with liberty to file fresh application.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake who appeared for the Monetary Board and the Attorney General raised objection against the withdrawal. He submitted that no directives had been issued and there was no document before the Court to establish it.
He said the existing directives had been suspended for two months and maintained that the 1st Petitioner Company the Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd did not exist and the 2nd and 3rd Petitioners were companies that operated as holdings companies of the 1st Petitioner.
He maintained the Counsel for the Petitioners had no standing before the Court and contended in the above legal background they have no right to withdraw their Writ Petition.
He insisted that the withdrawal should not be allowed and pleaded that the petition should be dismissed because the 1st petitioner was a non existing company.
Counsel Parathalingam PC counter argued that the original company Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd changed its name to Perpetual Treasuries Ltd in 2013 and maintained that it was merely change of name.
He said he had never heard a submission of this nature and that it was ridiculous for the Counsel for the Attorney General seeking not to permit withdrawal.
He underlined the petition could be dismissed after a finding and there must be a reason for it.
Presidents Counsel S.A. Parathalingam on March 30 submitted the impugned Directives issued by the Central Bank imposing restrictions on Perpetual Treasuries Ltd was due to expire on March 31 and brought to the cognizance of Court it is the subject matter of the this application.
He had stated the Petitioners were before the Court seeking to quash the impugned Directives issued by the Central Bank on November 7 on the basis that the impugned Directives are disproportionate, irrational, arbitrary and violated natural justice.
He had also submitted as the impugned Directives expired on March 31, he would reserve his right to take appropriate steps if fresh directives are issued.
He moved for time to notify the Court what steps he will take in regard to the present application.
Deputy Solicitor General Milinda Gunatilake appeared for Monetary Board and the Attorney General had informed Court he would reserve his right to object depending on the steps taken by the Petitioners Counsel.
Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd lamented that in the absence of no formal violation of procedure by it in the purported bond scandal, the true intentions of behind the issuing of the said Directions are mala fide and ultra vires of the regulatory powers of the Respondents.
It bemoaned that the impugned Directions are issued for extraneous reasons in order to satisfy the media and political agendas.
It stated that if the said impugned Directions are in force Perpetual Group of Companies will suffer grave and irremediable financial loss and will be driven to bankruptcy.
The Petitioners Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd, Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd cited Central Bank, Monetary Board and 11 others as Respondents.
Instructed by G.G.Arulpragasam, Presidents Counsel S.A.Parathalingam with Niskhan Parathalingam and Niranjan Arulpragasam appeared for Perpetual Treasuries (Pvt) Ltd while instructed by G.G. Arulpragasam, Nihal Fernando PC with Romali Tudawe and Maduka Perera appeared for Perpetual Asset Management (Pvt) Ltd and Perpetual Capital Holdings (Pvt) Ltd.

Ensure no impunity for hate crimes: EU
	
The European Union (EU) today emphasized the importance of the Sri Lankan Government and the Police to ensure that there is no impunity for hate crimes in the country.
EU Ambassador to Sri Lanka Tung-La Margue said it was important that religious communities are at the forefront of efforts to promote understanding and oppose the spreading of hate.
"Sri Lankans know all too well the consequences of religious and ethnic hatred. These reprehensible actions are intended to sow discord at a time when national reconciliation and tolerance is moving forward, he said.
He expressed these views after visiting Dewatagaha Mosque in Colombo to meet leaders of the Muslim community.
Apart from the EU Ambassador, the Heads of Missions of Australia, Canada, the Netherlands, Norway, South Africa and Switzerland together with other diplomatic representatives today visited the mosque.
Issuing a statement, the EU Delegation said the visit followed in the wake of attacks on mosques and businesses owned by people in the community.
The ambassadors expressed their solidarity and welcomed the clear condemnation for these hate crimes from President Maithripala Sirisena and Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe.
They emphasised the importance of the rule of law and called for prompt action to ensure that the perpetrators of these crimes were swiftly brought to justice. (By Thilanka Kanakarathna)

## Title: Founding Father of the Naval and Maritime Academy

## Date: 1 June 2017 01:47 am
Founding Father of the Naval and Maritime Academy
	
This appreciation on the birth centenary of Maharage George Stephen Perera  Stephen Aiyah to me - is from his first cousin. 
He obtained The Ceylon Teachers Certificate in English and Sinhala and came to Galle to teach at the Mount Calvary School, where my father was Headmaster. It was here that I came to know him personally when I was about ten years old. When he got married in 1951, at his request, I was his best man, and my late wife Rita, a bridesmaid. 
Perhaps, he is still one of the unsung heroes of the Sri Lanka Navy. 
In 1962 disaster struck the Navy  The training establishment at Diyatalawa was closed down permitting no training of any kind; No recruitment; Navy was left to rot resembling a battered hulk. 
What pulled, turned round and literally resurrected the derided Navy was the NMA; and that NMA was Instructor Commander M.G.S. Perera.
Yes,he did it in 1967 and that was a giant leap for the Navy.
He was the designer, the planner, the creator and the visionary who was made totally responsible by the Navy in 1965 for transforming within 20 months, an old and discarded set of buildings at at the Trincomalee Dockyard setting-up, giving birth, thereafter giving life and establishing the renowned Naval and Maritime Academy (NMA) at Trincomalee (in 1967) and that too with the restriction of having no approvals for extra-expenditure for any building work. 

He trained, taught, moulded and inspired generations of Officers and Sailors of the
Sri Lanka Navy

The firm foundation he laid has enabled the NMA to reach far greater heights with tremendous change, sailing through prosperity and adversity to become what it is today  a degree awarding naval academy awarded with the Presidents Colours. 
He trained, taught, moulded and inspired generations of Officers and Sailors of the Sri Lanka Navy -- some of whom even went on to hold the rank of Commander of the Navy -- and personnel from Fisheries Corporation and Sri Lanka Police and thereafter Merchant Navy Cadets on board for the Ceylon Shipping Corporation, over a total period extending beyond 30 long years. 
Even 45 years after his retirement from the Navy and 18 years after his death, this officer and gentleman is still fondly remembered, deeply appreciated and held in high esteem for his outstanding contributions and extraordinary achievements in establishing disciplined Naval training in this country. 
The very fact that, at his funeral, every retired Navy Commander alive was present is adequate testimony of how much these inputs have been appreciated. 
Stephen Aiyah was a qualified Chartered Engineer and a Fellow of the prestigious academic body Institute of Marine Engineers, London (FIMar.E). 

The very fact that, at his funeral, every retired Navy Commander alive was present is adequate testimony of how much these inputs have been appreciated

Soon after the singing maestro Sunil Santha (Joseph Aiyah to me) - another first cousin on my fathers side  left to join the Shanthi Nikethanya in India, in 1941, Stephen Aiyah followed him there to join the then renowned Victoria Jubilee Technical College in Bombay and obtained his Licentiate in Mechanical Engineering in 1947. 
For near two years from 1960 to 61, he received comprehensive training on vast areas of specialised naval subjects that covered navigation, meteorology, engineering, electronics, physics, Naval training and discipline, Naval training methodology and evaluation, etc. with a series of worthwhile achievements at many Naval training establishments in Britain and then in 1970, at San Diego, California and Annapolis, Maryland Academy in the USA. 
In 1962, he became the first and perhaps the only Sri Lankan Naval Officer to date to undergo a full time course to specialise in meteorology at the Royal Naval Air Station Culdrose in Cornwall to qualify as a Fellow / full member of The Royal Meteorological Society England (FRMet.S). 
He first served the Ceylon Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve (1949-51) as a Petty Officer Stoker Mechanic. When the Navy acquired its first ship H.M. Cy. S. Vijaya he joined her as part of the First all-Ceylon Crew to sail her from Trincomalee to Colombo for commission. 
He then joined The Royal Ceylon Navy as a direct entry Instructor Lieutenant as the Navys First Instructor (Training) Officer. 
The late Instructor Commander counted 23 years of distinguished unblemished Naval Service, and retired from the Sri Lanka Navy in June 1972 as the countrys First Director of Naval Training. 
For three years, he then served Walker Sons & Company Limited, Mutwal as Director / Senior Manager Fibre Glass Division. 
In 1975, on being invited by P. Karandawela, the then Chairman of the Ceylon Shipping Corporation, the late Commander joined M.V. Lanka Kalyani as Senior Staff Captain and sole sailing Nautical Instructor. 

He married a pretty maiden Maureen Johanna Samarakoon from Galle. She gave her husband unstinting loyal support in every sphere of life

He was responsible, single handedly, for training Deck Officer Cadets for a career in the Merchant Navy. He held this senior position for eight long years, sailing with many a Master Mariner of today; perhaps well over a hundred of them learnt the rudiments of navigation from him. 
After retirement, for a further period of 15 years until 82 years, often going against medical advice and despite poor vision in the left eye, he unhesitatingly offered his expertise from his residence, free, to many who sought his assistance. 
It was during this period that he wrote and published the then popular self-training manual: Trainees Guide in Celestial Navigation; ISBN: 955-95805-0-7  a big achievement, of one of his long-standing dreams, at the age of 78. 
By 1960 he was responsible, single handed, for the establishment of a competent Instructor Staff in the Ceylon Navy, to meet its demands for two decades ahead in disciplined naval training. 
At the beginning as the one and only instructor (training) officer of the Royal Ceylon Navy, he established the first Naval Technical Training Centre to train Artificer Apprentices before they were sent to training establishments in India. 
With a fertile mind he was eminently qualified, widely experienced and truly competent to perform all tasks of training of all types of officers and thereby we hardly have to ask England or India to train them for us. It resulted in saving appreciable amounts of foreign exchange for the Sri Lanka Government, hitherto expended on obtaining initial Naval training abroad. 
Perhaps Stephen Aiyahs greatest achievement, as I realised, was that he showed the world that our own Sri Lanka Navy could fully train Officers from cadets upwards, who could hold their own with Officers in any Navy, anywhere. 
Fifty years ago, he had foresight to see that the NMA became a National Institute and that the Navy alone, could train ALL sea-going personnel and award the successful and internationally accepted Academy Certificate. 
In 1961, H.M. Cy. S. Rangalla at Diyatalawa became the first ship to be manned entirely by Instructor Officers with Instructor Lieutenant Commander M.G.S. Perera as its first Commandant  the first non-executive branch officer to be appointed to command a ship. 
Since then he held, simultaneously, four Military Command appointments over a period of 10 consecutive years. 
He never offended anyone by word or deed and his company was always delightful. He was essentially a simple person who lived in rented houses and used public transport. Although he could easily have amassed a fortune, he never sought to enrich himself. 
He married a pretty maiden Maureen Johanna Samarakoon from Galle. She gave her husband unstinting loyal support in every sphere of life, throughout the 48 happy years they spent together. 
His son, Dr. Ajith C.S. Perera, and daughter, Deepthi C.J. Guneratne have in their own professional fields brought deserving honour and great fame to their illustrious father. 
With his death in August 1999, a life of gentleness and modesty came to an end.

Govt. mulls new laws for forcible evacuation
	
The Government would be compelled to bring in laws making provisions for forcible evacuation and to ban cultivation along mountain slopes if the attitude of people did not change, Minister of Disaster Management Anura Priyadharashana Yapa said yesterday.
The Minister said he would immediately take up the matter in the cabinet as more disasters were bound to happen, taking into consideration the global environmental situation.
The attitudes of the Sri Lankan people are such that they do not adhere to the warnings of impending disasters and refuse to leave their dwelling places in such situations. In such a situation eviction laws are essential, the Minister said.
It is also essential to bring in laws to ban cultivation of crops along the mountain slopes, in order to prevent landslides, he added.
The Minister said the recent disaster could be claimed as a man made one, considering the attitude of the people.
Meanwhile the latest data from the Disaster Management Centre (DMC) said the death toll from floods have risen to 203 while 89 people were still missing. Some 631,346 people belonging to 164,264 families were affected by adverse weather, by last afternoon. The highest death toll of 84 was recorded from Ratnapura, while 63 have died in the Kalutara District, 28 from Matara, 15 from Galle, five from Hambantota and four each from Gampaha and Kegalle. At least 1537 houses were totally destroyed while 7791 were partly damaged.
The government claimed that the affected areas were returning to normal. Buses were said to be plying in most of the affected areas. However, the bus service is still to commence along the Embilipitiya-Matara Road as of yesterday. Several damaged roads have been restored by the security forces. Only the Matara-Godagama entrance of the Southern Highway was still closed.
Around 276 contaminated wells have also been restored. All district secretariat offices in the affected areas were converted into disaster management co-ordination centres and are expected to remain open 24 hours. District Secretariat offices are considered as essential services.
Meanwhile the Department of Meteorology predicted strong winds along the sea areas of Puttalam via Potuvil, Colombo, Hambantota, Batticaloa and Mulaithivu. Winds were expected to travel at 70 kmph. Landslide warnings continue in Ratnapura, Kegalle, Galle, Kalutara, Matara, Hambantota and Nuwara Eliya districts.
Showers or thundershowers may occur in the Uva Province, Batticaloa and Ampara districts, particularly in the afternoon. Rains would exceed 70mm occasionally. (Reports from Yohan Perera , Sandun Jayasekera, Thilanka Kankaratne and Chathuranga Pradeep)

Angelo Mathews' hamstring injury may keep him out of their opening Champions Trophy encounter against South Africa on Saturday (June 3).
Skipper Mathews who returned to the side after a long injury layoff has injured his hamstring once again during the practice game. His absence will be a major blow to the islanders who will be facing South Africa in the tournament opener.
Its a very minor injury, Mathews said. I am trying my best to play on 3rd. Doctors have not ruled out a possibility of playing on Saturday but I will definitely be available for the second match.
Mathews injured his hamstring injury during his match-winning innings in the second T20 against South Africa in January and missed both Australian and Bangladesh series played thereafter.
He made his return during the Indian Premier League in April before joining the national squad in early May. (Mirror Cricket)

Island's gravitation towards North Pole the cause of recent landslides
	
Sri Lankas gradual movement towards the North Pole could be the reason for landslides occurring in the country during the last few days, one of the top geologists in the country said yesterday.
Professor Kapila Dahanayake from the Department of Geology, Faculty of Science, University of Peradeniya told Daily Mirror that the Islands movement, at approximately 8 cm per year towards the North Pole, could be the reason for the landslides.
This gradual movement, which would have begun at least a million years ago, had resulted in forming glacier sediments which comprises sand, boulders, clay and pebbles on Sri Lankas surface. It has been these glaciers that got washed away in the form of landslides during the past few days, Professor Dahanayake said.
If one looks at the landslides that occurred, it is clear that what came sliding down the mountains with the gushing rain water were piles of sand and boulders rather than large rocks. This can be seen in the landslides that took place at Morawaka and a number of other locations, he added. He said that boulders comes down together with sand and clay, which softens as a result of the heavy rain.
However Professor Dahanayake said responsible persons in the country were not ready to accept his theory. He said this situation would prevent the country from taking effective steps to stop more tragedies in the future. It is high time that one looks at this situation seriously, he warned.

NASA made an announcement about its first mission to enter directly into the sun's atmosphere at an event at University of Chicago's William Eckhardt Research Center on Wednesday.
As part of the unmanned mission, the Parker Solar Probe, named for solar astrophysicist Eugene Parker, will go to the sun's outer atmosphere next summer.
The probe will move more than 430,000 miles per hour (the equivalent of traveling from New York to Tokyo in less than a minute) and be seven times closer to the sun than any previous spacecraft.
NASA plans to use advanced material technologies in the form of a heat shield and new solar panels to reach the sun's corona, which is the outermost part of its atmosphere. This area's temperature measures around 2,500 degrees Fahrenheit.
NASA will use the information it mines from the mission to better forecast space weather, which impacts satellites, astronauts and the Earth.

Prime Minister Ranil Wickremessinghes private visit to the US was unavoidable and planned a couple of months earlier and therefore, he had no option but to undertake it, cabinet spokesman, Lands and Parliamentary Reforms Minister Gayantha Karunatilaka said and added the visit was for a medical checkup.
Minister Karunatilaka said Mr. Wickremesinghe has instructed relevant Ministers and officials to keep in touch with him round the clock to appraise him on the flood situation and called for situation reports every six hours.
He also gives advice regularly to Ministers and officials from the US on flood relief operations, Minister Karunatilaka added.
Minister Karunatilaka said if Mr. Wickremesinghe did not undertake this visit, he would have to wait for several months to rearrange it.
Commenting on certain media reports on Mr. Wickremesinghes visit to the US at a time when the country was trying to come to terms with a devastating flood and landslides, Minister Karunatilaka said Premier Wickremesinghe held a several rounds of talks with Ministers and officials and gave clear instructions on how to face the unprecedented natural disaster before he left.
Before his departure to US, Prime Minister Wickremesinghe met President Maithripala Sirisena. He told ministers and officials not to let circulars, Financial or Administrative regulations hamper flood relief operations. It was in one of these meetings that the Central Bank was directed to release Rs. 2 billion to commercial banks to launch a soft loan scheme for flood victims, Minister Karunatilaka said.

President declined to declare 'Emergency Situation': Dilan
	
President Maithripala Sirsena has turned down a request made by certain foreign countries to declare an Emergency Situation in Sri Lanka to offer further assistance, since it will affect the countrys reputation, Highways State Minister Dilan Perera said.
Addressing the weekly SLFP weekly news briefing at the party office Minister Perera said if an emergency situation was declared, the joint opposition will use it for their political advantage and therefore such action was not necessary as correctly decided by President Sirisena.
Some 19 countries have already come forward to assist Sri Lanka in the disaster. They have asked us the areas we need help. The government agencies will dispatch all relief material and food donated by foreign countries to the affected areas. The money given by foreign countries will be used to construct houses that had been fully destroyed, Minister Perera said.
Minister Perera said at todays government group meeting held headed by President Sirisena it was decided to set up a Contingency Plan to face an unexpected natural disaster.
The Contingency Plan includes to keep a fleet of boats, airplanes, choppers, dry rations, clothes, drugs and a trained armed forces personnel in readiness to deploy in disaster affected areas.
The correct leadership of President Suirisena and policies of the good governance have led a large number of countries volunteering to help Sri Lanka at this hour of distress which was not forthcoming in the recent past.
Minister Perera said certain natural disaster affected areas during the previous regime were still to be rehabilitated, with no facility to build houses for victims and construct roads and infrastructure as there were no foreign countries to help Sri Lanka.
What happened at that time was if Russia helped us, the US would turn back to Sri Lanka. If India helped, China and Pakistan would be offended. But today Sri Lanka is a friend of all countries rich and powerful and therefore no issue of helping us has arisen by any one due to our foreign policy, Minister Perera added.(Sandun A Jayasekera)

The sudden resurgence of anti-Muslim attacks
	
The Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) described as a break-away Sinhala Buddhist nationalist organisation, made themselves popular for creating anti-Muslim attacks during the recent past. Just after the Sinhala and Tamil New year, a sudden spate of attacks on mosques and business establishments owned by Muslims has created much tension among the community once again. During the time the Muslim community is observing Ramadan, which is considered as one of the five pillars of Islam, such upheavals would have been least expected. While the blame game still continues, quite surprisingly the government seemed to have turned a blind eye as opposed to the remarks made by the President when he came in to power. In an attempt to shed light on this matter, Daily Mirror the recollects the sudden outbreak of incidents while inquiring the matter from both ends. 
The Govt. is not interested in finding a solution to this matter- MCSL President
 Six to seven business establishments came under arson attack recently
	 Instead of observing Ramadhan fast, we live in fear of attacks
	 It is surprising to see the police continue to be silent and take no action
President of the Muslim Council of Sri Lanka (MCSL), N.M. Ameen says that Sinhalese and Muslims have had a strong friendship over centuries. But these groups are now trying to destabilise the Muslim economy. During the recent attacks, six to seven business establishments came under arson attack, that includes a factory in Wennappuwa. In addition to that even mosques had been attacked. This is a period where the Muslims in Sri Lanka and all over the world observe Ramadhan, a fast that lasts 30 days. But instead we have to live in fear. I see that the government is also not interested in finding a tangible solution to this matter. If it is dialogue what the BBS really need, then we are happy to sit down and talk with them but that doesnt seem to be the case either. 
If I recall correctly, the Sri Lanka Police is quite an efficient and a powerful force. But why have they backed out only in this situation queries Ameen, who is worried about the actions taken by the authorities. Not a single person was arrested or taken in for questioning. We have made several appeals but still we havent got any good news. 
It is quite hilarious to know that they are denying all allegations, Ameen said in his concluding remarks. Nobody in their right mindset would burn down their own property, would they The age old friendship that the Muslims and Buddhists have had, had been tarnished by these groups. The majority community has spoken in favour of us. At least a few groups have protested against these recent turnout of events but we hope and pray that they would stop this menace. 
We categorically deny all allegations on the recent attacks- BBS spokesperson
Speaking to the , BBS spokesperson Dilantha Withanage said that the global Sinhala Buddhist community has become a minority. Sinhala Buddhists have had threats right from the beginning. This is because they only represent close to 15 million of the global population, while there are approximately 1,600 million Muslims live globally. Various global forces such as economy, media and politics have a major impact on this break down. Back in the day there was an International Christian agenda.
Sinhala Buddhists were under threat from the beginning
	We are branded as a militant organization
	The episode fabricated by certain politicians for political gain
This was at the time of the Dutch when they burnt down temples and other places which belonged to the Buddhist faith. Several Evangelical groups too were on the rise but this trend has now died down and is not as bad as in the yesteryears. There were instances when people gave up their religion for money. 
In his further remarks, Withanage said that in the case of most religions, theres a global community. Take for example the case of Tamils. They too have a Global Tamil Agenda. One of their main concerns is that they dont have a country of their own. They wanted to settle down in India but this didnt work out as expected. So they are trying to find their ground in Sri Lanka. Likewise there is a Global Islamic Agenda and this is funded by wealthy nations such as Saudi Arabia.
During Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumarathungas regime she requested to set up a Presidential Commission on Buddha Sasana and she wouldnt have wanted to set up such a committee if not for any underlying issue. People think that Buddhism is our state religion but that is not the case either. The report was published when Ranil Wickremesinghe was the Prime Minister. These groups allegedly went on destroying Buddhist archaeological sites and created a crisis situation and this may have been one reason to setup this Commission. 

That was a political stunt by the UNP. If I refer to a lone incident, we invited Gotabhaya to one of our events in Galle along with the then Mayor M.J.M. Muzammil. The media published photos of Ven. Gnanasara and Gotabhaya and not Muzammil. So what are we to do

The media have a huge role to play in giving us the appropriate backing. But it was not up to our expectations, says Dilantha, referring to several reports which were published in various print media. We have been described as a militant organization, and I dont think that is the correct adjective to describe us. Dilantha further challenged the relevant groups to present evidence and prove that it was the BBS supporters who were involved in the recent turnout of events burning down shops owned by Muslims and destroying their property. If I refer to the attack on the mosque, they obviously have CCTV cameras there. But what I heard was that these cameras too didnt work when collecting evidence. So there is something wrong in the process. Hence, we categorically deny all the allegations on the recent attacks. 
The BBS was known to have been supported by certain groups in Norway but when asked about this, the BBS spokesman again denied it. This was a story fabricated by Asad Salih and Wimal Weerawansa. When Weerawansa told this at the beginning, Ven. Gnanasara asked him to prove it. But they failed.
These allegations do not have any solid base and they are mere rumours. There were also speculations that we had a link with Gotabhaya Rajapakse. That was a political stunt by the UNP. If I refer to a lone incident, we invited Gotabhaya to one of our events in Galle along with the then Mayor M.J.M. Muzammil. The media published photos of Ven. Gnanasara and Gotabhaya and not Muzammil. So what are we to do

Tobacco Control initiates sustainable development
	
May 31-World No Tobacco Day
Governments must implement strong tobacco control measures to ensure good health of their citizens and promote sustainable development. 
Everyone has a role and right to play to promote and establish sustainable development goals. The United Nations agencies, the World Bank, international development banks and other public and private donors should assist governments to reach the sustainable development goals. 
Tobacco use undermines public health and sustainable development in a country. Almost 70 percent of global deaths are caused by non-communicable diseases (NCDs) such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, diabetes and chronic lung diseases. These diseases have one major risk factor in common, it is tobacco use. Over 1 billion people use tobacco today. Unless we take action now, tobacco will cause 1 billion deaths worldwide this century and 80 percent of this would occur in low and middle-income countries. 
Tobacco use also costs national economies enormously through increased healthcare costs and decreased productivity. It is estimated that over the next 20 years, the economic loss associated with tobacco related disease will be US$12 trillion. 
Tobacco use also worsens health disparities and aggravates the problem of poverty since the poorest people spend less on essentials such as food, education and healthcare. 

Tobacco control is inexpensive and highly effective. At an average cost of US$.05 per person to implement in low-and middle-income countries, tobacco taxation is the least costly of all tobacco control policies

In this context, there is a clear roadmap for effective, feasible and globally endorsed action. The World Health Organizations WHO - Framework Convention on Tobacco Control (FCTC) has been recognized in the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) as a critical tool to help achieve wellbeing for all - at all ages. 
The FCTC is one of the only three international conventions explicitly referenced in the SDGs appearing as target 3a - a means of implementation for Goal 3.4 on NCDs. 
Tobacco control is inexpensive and highly effective. At an average cost of US$.05 per person to implement in low-and middle-income countries, tobacco taxation is the least costly of all tobacco control policies. And tobacco taxation creates more revenue for governments than it costs to implement. Similarly, raising tobacco taxes is the single most effective way to reduce consumption of tobacco products and in turn it diminishes detrimental effects of tobacco use on health and development. 
Globally raising the tax on a pack of 20 cigarettes by the equivalent of one dollar would increase average price by 42 percent and results in 81 million fewer deaths. Higher taxes also discourage minors from taking up smoking in the first place. 
Similarly, raising tobacco taxes is the single most effective way to reduce consumption of tobacco products and in turn it diminishes detrimental effects
While increased tobacco taxes boost good health, they can also provide governments with significant additional revenue. It is estimated that a global increase in tobacco tax of the equivalent of one dollar would result in an extra US$141 billion in revenue for governments. The extra revenue generated by tax increases can, in turn, be used to finance other development priorities. In fact tobacco taxes are a key tool to finance Sustainable Development Goals. 
Evidence suggests that the availability of single cigarettes poses a potential threat to public health because they may be more affordable and accessible than packs especially to youth and people with fewer resources. As countries implement tobacco-control policies proven to reduce tobacco use, the availability of single cigarettes could potentially undermine the effectiveness of strong policies.

UNESCO warns scrapping of SL sites from list if not maintained well
	
UNESCO has informed the government that it will be compelled to remove several archeological sites in Sri Lanka from the world heritage list as they have not been maintained properly, Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
Minister Kariyawasam, under whose purview the Department of Archeology comes, told a media briefing that UNESCO had informed him that it would have to remove sites such as Dambulla and Galle Fort from the world heritage list as they were not maintained properly.
The biggest issue is unlawful settlements in the lands which belong to these sites. The government will be compelled to bring in laws on unlawful settlements in order to safeguard world heritage sites in Sri Lanka and to minimize damages from natural disasters, he said.
He said the inherited characteristic of the people not to move out of vulnerable areas despite warnings of impending natural disasters had caused most of the deaths and casualties during the recent floods and landslides. (By Yohan Perera)

## Title: Vaishnavee  The return of Sumitra Peries

Vaishnavee  The return of Sumitra Peries
	
The most intriguing part about Vaishnavee, Sumithra Peries latest movie, is that it subtly tricks you into believing theres something intriguing. Its a rare work of art at a time when art is being compelled to bring out a largely nonexistent feeling of profundity. Theres nothing profound about it  it isnt an existential tract on urban angst or an indictment on the status quo  but then Sumithra (like her husband) has never intellectualised the cinema like some of her own contemporaries have. Consequently, Vaishnavee is from the beginning chock-a-block with a sense of simplicity and navet I couldnt really evade. Or for that matter resist. 
The title is a reference, an allusion. Vaishnavee was one of the many consorts of Lord Shiva, who is creator, destroyer and transformer all in one. Sumitra finds a human equivalent for the latter in Osanda, a puppet-maker from Matara. The first hour of the story is about a thwarted romance: Osanda is betrothed to a woman (Shehara Hewadewa, mildly resembling the graceful Rathmalie Gunasekera) who elopes and leaves him devastated. Because he cant have her, he tries carving what he liked about her into a puppet, a problem given that it was carved from a tree which wasnt blessed before being cut down. Consequently, the puppet comes to life. 
The story (conceived by Lester James Peries, as the titles inform us) is so simple, so out there and clear, that its almost literal-minded. But Sumitra isnt a literary director (shes still the best editor Ive come across here), so she instills enough visual poetry in her plot and subplots (even the ones that go nowhere) that one can only be entranced. 

The past is charming. It swells us with nostalgia. Vaishnavee does exactly that. Even in its most banal sequences

When the opening credits rolled in white-type-against-black set to the late Nimal Mendis music, I knew I was entering a morally simplified world. These arent really characters, I thought to myself as I saw Osanda (Thumudu Dodantanne), his cousin Ruchira (Samadhi Arunachaya), her father (Jayalath Manorathna), his mother (Irangani Serasinghe) and their magul kapuwa (Mahendra Perera). They arent types either. As with the later work of Ray and Kurosawa, Sumitra tries to enmesh her cast in her simplified, optimistic world. She ends up enmeshing us in them. 

Someone told me that Vaishnavee works on three layers with the puppet-maker, the woman he loves and the puppet he idealises her in. Sumitra doesnt need to rationalise these explicitly because put simply, theyre there for all to see. Her world is tied together by familial bonds, the same bonds which define her husbands work. It contains so much innocence that when Osanda tries to cut his wrist after discovering his betrothed has eloped, the camera quickly cuts to Manorathna hurrying in and stopping him. Their world is so unlike ours, not surprisingly: set down in clear-cut terms, with characters rarely venting out their feelings, it belongs to the past. 
But the past is charming. It swells us with nostalgia. Vaishnavee does exactly that. Even in its most banal sequences  as when Osanda talks to his puppets or when his uncle reflects on his goodness over breakfast  we give ourselves up. No matter how mushy these are, they are needed. Formally they are static but it is from that staticity that they derive life. The reason for that, in fact the only reason I can think of, is that Sumitra has been working on movies for the past 40 years, 50 if we are to include her career as an editor. Banality isnt just the preserve of the past, its also the preserve of the masters and mesdames of that past. Sumitra didnt start off with that banality, she challenged it. Not just challenged it but conquered it. Those years helped. 
Vaishnavee isnt flawless, however, and I would be doing an injustice to both Sumitra and her movie if I dont ponder on something in it that bothered me. 
The worst movies can be salvaged by plots that parse. The best movies can be undone by plots that dont. The first half of Vaishnavee on that count is the best, because it gets us ready for a climax, revelation and finale. To my disappointment (mild as it was) though, I didnt get any of these, at least not to the extent that the first half warranted. Naturally enough, the second half didnt parse: it continued to return to its own workings, devoting little time or energy to what it should have led us to. 
The first 75 minutes of the story is about Osanda. It centres on him so much that he remains our hero even when his puppet starts taunting him and Ruchira. He exemplifies everything innocent about the plot. But innocence alone isnt enough: there must be some form of coherence, of chemistry. We dont get either after those 75 minutes, in part owing to the intrusion of that puppet and the actor playing her. 

The opening credits establishes Sumitras world  so out there, so clear, so naive, so innocent  and so does the closing credits

Yashoda Wimaladharmas ascent as an actor who selects her scripts and gives her best with the few she gets into isnt recent. Shes been in the industry long enough to know that a bad script can be salvaged by a good performance and a great script can be stunted by a bad performance. As the Vaishnavee figure, she does a pretty decent job of bringing together the real and the ideal. I cant think of another actor who could have played a puppet like that, because she is an actress who by default personifies the kind of defiant steeliness only a puppet-come-alive can evoke. Formally and aesthetically, therefore, she sustains that characterisation throughout. Commendably. 
But then she represents everything, or almost everything, thats vague in the second half. Its not her fault only, moreover: its also the fault of the innocence that precedes her intrusion. For her foray into Osandas life can only be rooted in the assumption that she desires Osanda, Osanda carved the ideal of the other woman into her and Osanda loved that other woman. If that last point isnt properly brought out, it can ruin the spell of the entire movie. Which is almost exactly what happened. 
Not only do we not infer any chemistry between Osanda and his betrothed (theyre together in only one scene), we also dont understand what he took to in her. We are forced to conclude that the puppet epitomises something in her, though we dont know what it is, barring an unhelpfully vague remark by Osanda to Ruchira. I am not sure whether the chemistry between him and it was supposed to be vague (since puppets arent expressive after all) but factoring even that in, I was upset by how the latter transcended the narrative. Its as though the plot had been set up to introduce her but she wasnt bothered by what set her up in the first place. 
For that reason, everything I took to in Vaishnavee  the effects, the romance, the likeability of the characters  ballooned to such a level that I was baffled. I liked Ruchiras empathetic figure, but owing to two computer-generated sequences I got tired of her hysterics. Those two sequences, moreover, were incongruous with the effects that preceded them (in particular the transformation of puppet into woman, which was so sudden that it was unsettling). As for the father and the grandmother, they dont take too well to the puppets antics, but they arent too uptight about it either. Normally that wouldnt have bothered me, except for the fact that even when they discover whats going on, their reactions dont seriously merit our attention. 
Of course if we assume that all these are rooted in Osandas feeling of hurt at being rejected, the plot will parse. But then the ending also bothered me. Consider this: you have a puppet that defiantly stays with our hero even when his family and Rohana Baddage try to banish her to her world with an exorcism-of-sorts. Then you have her justifying her position by pointing out that one cant love someone to compensate for the anguish of an unrequited love.
All fine and well, but consider what happens next: she returns to her world with a fadeout thats abruptly followed by the credits. 
The opening credits establishes Sumitras world  so out there, so clear, so naive, so innocent  and so does the closing credits. But what really preceded the latter Are we supposed to empathise with the puppet If we do, what do we make of her (forced) return to her world Does her parting line, about love being both divine and human, mean anything when considering that Osandas affair with his betrothed amounted to nothing And what of that subplot involving that betrothed and the man she runs away with (Roshan Pilapitiya) Why dont we return to it For that matter, should we These are questions that haunted me as I left the hall, with the caveat that they didnt disappoint me. But the fact that I wasnt disappointed doesnt leave me consoled. Vaishnavee takes us back to that time when a movie could entrance you by narrative power alone. Unlike Sakman Maluwa, there arent any undertones.
Unlike Yahaluwo, there arent any overtones. Which is a relief, I should think. Consequently, theres nothing in it to intellectualise or academise. This is Sumithra asserting her purest, simplest self, something I took to at once despite an overspent final half-hour. 
To be sure, one review isnt enough to dwell on these points. All I can then say is that I went to watch her movie as a critic, not a director. Technically, formally, aesthetically, it pleased me. Despite its manifest incongruities, I liked it. And not for nothing: in a world thats inhabited by blacks and whites being touted as shades of grey by our art-house directors, Sumitras movie is a refreshing contrast. It takes us to the past because it belongs to the past. I can only hope (and I do believe) that this will be enough to salvage its limitations, discernible as they are.
