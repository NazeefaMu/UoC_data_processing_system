JVP lost because it supported the UNP: Somawansa
	
Former Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) leader Somawansa Amarasinghe said it was sad to see the JVP being wiped out at the August 17 general election. Mr. Amarasinghe said the main reason for the debacle was that the JVP was toeing the UNP agenda.
He claimed that the JVP, the main socialist party in the country, had not adhered to the original JVP principles because it was being misled and hoodwinked by the UNP.
The fate of JVP does not surprise me. Only the JVP could speak out on behalf of the people. The four leaders of the JVP should be removed immediately. They are dishonest that is why the people did not vote for the JVP, Mr. Amarasinghe said.
He said the newly elected governments move to establish a national government would fail and a coalition government would be formed with the support of some members of the UNP and UPFA. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Poll monitors regret defeated candidates entering parliament
	
A leading election monitoring group today expressed its regret and disappointment over the nomination of defeated candidates to parliament through the national list and called for a new criterion for this purpose.
Eight defeated candidates have been nominated to parliament through the United People's Freedom Alliance (UPFA) national list, one each through the national lists of the United National Party (UNP), the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) and the Tamil National Alliance (TNA).
People's Action for Free and Fair Elections (PAFFREL) Executive Director Rohana Hettiarachchi said guidelines were necessary to prevent those not eligible from entering Parliament.
He said some of the defeated candidates nominated to parliament through the national list there were several who were not eligible for such nomination.
Mr. Hettiarachchi admitted to the fact that there were some who where worthy of being nominated to parliament.
Meanwhile, Campaign for Free and Fair Election (CaFFE), another leading election monitoring group, also criticized the appointment of defeated candidates though the national list.
CaFFE Executive Director Keerthi Tennekoon said it a defeated candidate who was appointed through the national list was responsible for the post-election violence in Katankudi.
He said it was disappointing to see such defeated candidates being appointed through the national list. Such of these appointments are blow to the efforts made by President Maithripala Sirisena to change the political culture of this country, Mr. Hettiarachchi added. (YP)

Rosy asks for recount; rejects UK HC offer
	
In the wake of a large number of supporters requesting former state minister and UNP Colombo district candidate Rosy Senanayake to apply for a recount, she had written to the Elections Commissioner requesting him to carry out a recount of the preference votes polled at the August 17 general election.
She told Daily Mirror that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe had also approved her request for a recount. Ms. Senanayake is on top of the UNP losers list having received 65,320 preferential votes.
She said she was optimistic of receiving an increased number votes in case of a recount, but emphasized that whatever the result of the recount maybe, she would support government efforts at rebuilding a new Sri Lanka and continue to serve the people as before.
Meanwhile, Ms. Senanayake said she had not accepted the Prime Ministers offer of being appointed as the Sri Lankas High Commissioner to Britain because she was not happy about deserting the people who placed their confidence in her.
As a longstanding UNPer, I am happy about the UNP emerging victorious at this election and will cooperate with the party in achieving its objectives. I will do my best to improve the lot of women and children and concentrate on resolving their concerns and the problems faced by them, Ms. Senanayake said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Sampur lands returned to owners
	
A new ministry will be set up to promote reconciliation, mutual understanding and communal harmony soon under the powers vested with the President in the 19th Amendment, President Maithripala said.
He said the government was fully committed and had prioritized the resolution of the problems and concerns faced by the Tamils in the North.
The President said this when addressing those who attended the public function, held at Sampur in Trincomalee on Saturday, to mark the return of lands to their original owners. These lands had been earlier acquired by the armed forces for the purpose of setting up a high security zone.
The President said Sri Lanka belonged to all communities and that the government would create an environment which would allow all Sri Lankans to live in any place of their choice without any discrimination or hindrance.
I am determined to provide you the facilities and benefits enjoyed by the people living in the South. This government belongs to all Sri Lankans irrespective of their caste, creed or community and as such, under this government no community will be discriminated against nor suffer deprivation, he said.
On January 8, you placed your confidence and trust in me by electing me as the President of Sri Lanka. I won the presidential election because people in the North and East voted en masse for me. I assure you that I will not disappoint you or wreck the confidence you placed in me. My government's policy is to serve all Sri Lankans no matter what their status, caste, creed or community maybe, the President said. We were at war for nearly 30 years. War brings nothing good and positive other than destruction, disharmony, hatred and ill-feeling among communities. That is why this government commits itself to uprooting the factors that contributed to such a situation."
The President said the armed forces acquired land in many parts of the country especially in the North for the war effort.
"The war is over and peace has returned and the government has now decided to hand over those lands to the original owners. There may be some who perceive these efforts with a negative mindset, but the government is confident it is doing the right thing for the welfare of the Tamil people, who have suffered much during the conflict," he said.
The President said the government would also develop the education, health and infrastructure in the North and pointed out that the people who received their lands back would have the opportunity of cultivating them and earning a proper income to develop their livelihoods.
"People living as internally displaced persons under extremely difficult conditions can now return. The government will listen to the grievances of the people in the North and resolve their problems. Tamil leaders like R. Sampanthan are always talking to the government about the problems affecting the northern people. Several EU-member states, the US, India, the UN, UNICEF and UNDP have come forward to help the people in the North and East thus endorsing the governments commitment. (SAJ)
