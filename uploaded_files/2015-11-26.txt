Ceylinco Insurance becomes only insurer in Sri Lanka?s Top 25 companies
	
Patrick Alwis ? Managing Director of Ceylinco General Insurance and Thushara Ranasinghe ? Deputy Chief Executive Officer ? Ceylinco Life Insurance, receiving the award from Prime Minister, Ranil Wickremasinghe
Ceylinco Insurance, once again earned the honour of being the only Insurance Company amongst the top 25 companies in Sri Lanka for the year 2014 / 2015, at a gala ceremony held at the Colombo Hilton recently. The occasion marked the fourth consecutive year that Ceylinco Insurance came out ahead in the insurance arena in the island, achieving a truly unique feat.
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe graced the awards ceremony as its chief guest. The Premier, delivering the keynote address, explained to the distinguished gathering of religious and business leaders and Parliamentarians, the government?s vision for our nation, on how to develop, both economically and socially, despite the numerous global uncertainties facing the modern world.
Announcing the Top 25 Companies in Sri Lanka, the October 2015 issue of the Business Today magazine, outlined the stringent criteria that needed to be fulfilled, including an impressive financial performance during the financial year ending December 31st, 2014 and March 31st, 2015.?
The financial information being reviewed for the selection process covered several aspects, which included: revenue, share turnover, profit after tax, growth in turnover, growth in profit, return on equity, growth in earnings per share, market capitalisation, value of shares transacted and value addition. Meanwhile, three years ago, ?Business Today? introduced an assessment method to evaluate corporate governance amongst the considered criteria, and it was and continues to be, widely believed that utilising such a method is likely to influence better transparency and enhance accountability in public listed companies, enabling continued public trust and confidence in the corporate sector of the country.?
?The Business Today Top 25; the leaders of corporate Sri Lanka, have a great responsibility. They have the experience, the ability, and the impetus to become global companies. The market is not only Sri Lanka, but overseas as well?, the October 2015 issue of ?Business Today?, commented in relation to the nation?s corporate echelon.
In another record-breaking year, during 2014, Ceylinco Insurance recorded a premium income of Rs.24.1 billion, while up to the third quarter of 2015, Ceylinco General Insurance and Ceylinco Life Insurance, had together yielded an even more impressive total premium income of Rs.19.6 billion. Along with this honour, and having been hailed as the undisputed market leader in the Sri Lankan Insurance sphere for the 11th consecutive year, Ceylinco Insurance also enjoys the euphoria of having been voted the People?s Insurance Company, for the ninth consecutive year, reiterating the high regard with which the company is viewed by the general public, and its continuous contributions towards enhancing the socio-economic development of Sri Lanka.

	Presidents Counsel Kuvera De Zoysa, Attorneys Sugath Kaldera and Nishan Premathiratne who appeared for them at the inquiry today argued that their clients should not have been named as respondents in the inquiries.

	The official said the next public hearing on inquiries into the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka controversy had been fixed for December 3, 4, 11, 22 and 23.
	Mr. Rajapaksa, the Avant Garde Chairman, the former Navy Commanders Jayantha Kolabage, Jayantha Perera, and former assistant secretary to the defence ministry were yesterday summoned by the commission to record evidence with regard to the alleged fraud and corruption at the Rakna Arakshaka Lanka Ltd.

The Indian government is examining BCCI's request for a green signal for the Indian cricket team to play Pakistan in Sri Lanka in December, amid indications that Islamabad's continuing support to terror groups will be a major factor in shaping the decision.
"We have to take into account what impact our decision can have on the morale of the country when there is no let-up in support for terrorists from across the border," a top-ranking government functionary told TOI just after BCCI confirmed that it had approached the Centre for its clearance.
BCCI secretary Anurag Thakur said on Wednesday that the board had made a formal request to the ministry of external affairs (MEA) on Tuesday, seeking clearance to play Pakistan. He emphasised that given its adherence to ICC's Futures Tour Programme, BCCI was committed to playing Pakistan "in UAE or at any other neutral venue if the conditions in Pakistan were not suitable".

Sharif allows India-Pak series to hold in SL
	
Pakistan Prime Minister Nawaz Sharif on Thursday gave green signal to Pakistan Cricket Board (PCB) for series against India in Sri Lanka next month, Dunya News reported.
The permission letter forwarded by the PM House has been received by PCB Chief Shehryar Khan.
India and Pakistan were scheduled to play two Tests, five one-dayers and two Twenty20 internationals in December and January.
Pakistan have been playing their home series in the United Arab Emirates because of security fears at home, but India was unwilling to send its team to the UAE.
Later, Sri Lanka emerged as a likely solution after crisis talks at the weekend between PCB chairman Shaharyar Khan and Board of Control for Cricket in India (BCCI) counterpart Shashank Manohar in Dubai failed to end the stalemate.
The meeting was organized by Giles Clarke, who heads the ICC Pakistan task force.
Both cricket boards had signed a memorandum of understanding last year to play at least six series from 2015 to 2023, with Pakistan hosting the first one in December. But all series were subject to clearance from their respective governments.
The BCCI was willing to talk about compensating the PCB in case it agreed to play the series in India, but Pakistan rejected the proposal, saying India should honor its commitment.
Pakistan also said India had not made any request about sharing revenue.
India and Pakistan have not played a full series since 2007. New Delhi halted all cricket matches with Pakistan following the 2008 attacks in Mumbai, although they did play a limited-overs series in 2012.
Last month, hardline Hindu activists sabotaged talks between India and Pakistan cricket officials in Mumbai.

	Dr. Sharma announced that UN Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon will be in Malta for the Commonwealth summit which will be held at the historic Fort St Angelo tomorrow. The UN chief will be addressing a session on climate change, which is expected to take centre stage during this biennial summit.
	The event, which brings together 53 Heads of State and government from across the globe, could have an influence on the Paris summit on climate change scheduled to take place a week later.
	Prime Minister Joseph Muscat said after he takes over as Chair in Office from President Sirisena he would work with the vision of making the organization a people?s commonwealth, rather than a Commonwealth of States. He added that the Commonwealth countries should show a political will in favour of sustainable development.

According to the Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority, Chinese tourists are the fastest growing group with over 164,000 visiting the island in the first nine months of this year, which represents a 73.6 percent increase.?
To attract this emerging group of tourists, more and more businesses have started accepting UnionPay as a payment method.
With the holiday season fast approaching, many businesses, especially in the tourism sector, are getting ready for the busiest time of the year. ?To help businesses further boost their sales, Derek Chang, Head of South Asia of UnionPay International, offers 3 practical tips below:
Offer unique holiday deals: ?Do not try to be the same as your competitors. ?Consider running special promotions to attract your target group of tourists to come and spend in this holiday season. With limited time and resources, many hotels and restaurants have already started focusing their energy in marketing to specific tourist segments, such as offering special discount for UnionPay Cardholders, to maximize their return on marketing investments. ?
Communicate clearly: ?Communication is the key to marketing success. Including their native languages in key promotional messages would not just ensure tourists understand your service or product offerings; but also create a stronger incentive to buy. ?Not sure which languages to include? ? Sri Lanka Tourism Development Authority periodically releases statistics and is a good starting point for finding out which are the emerging group of inbound tourists.
Think like a tourist: While tourists often pay by cash, many would pay by their preferred debit or credit cards. According to the survey conducted by the international research company - AC Nielsen, UnionPay has a remarkable 100% brand recognition rate in the Chinese Mainland. ?Businesses that address preference of their target customers are likely to capture more sales opportunities and satisfied customers tend to give higher ratings in their online reviews.
