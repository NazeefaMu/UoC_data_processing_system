A retirement that became a joke
	

The department responsible for maintaining law and order has been coming into public focus now and again due to the queer things happening in it for some time.

Perhaps, the latest queer thing reported from this department relates to a funny service extension granted to a high-up in the department.
The high-up involved is the head of the division handling financial crimes. When he reached the age of retirement, he was granted a one-year service extension, but he was asked to remain at home for one month before resuming work in the extended period. And a namesake of his was appointed to act in the post in the interim!
Some inquisitive ones who had made discreet inquiries as to why the divisional chief was required to resume work after a one-month gap soon stumbled on the reason.
The highest one in the yahapalanaya echelons had received an unusual request from a leading Buddhist prelate in the upcountry relating to the departmental high-up functioning in his area playing an additional role as a Kedum-bindum Vedamahattaya (an orthopedic Ayurvedic physician). The Police chief in our area serving the people as a Kedum-bindum Vedamahattaya as well, is due to retire from service in another one months time. In fact, I too am taking treatment from him. Please give him a promotion to a higher rank without delay so that he will be entitled to a higher pension on retirement.
The highest authority could not disregard this request so he had the financial division chief sent on retirement to make way for promoting Vedamahattaya. When the Vedamahattaya now promoted to a higher rank, goes on retirement in another one month, the retired financial crimes division head will be reinstated with a service extension to resume duties in the same post! What a fuss they had to make just to give a promotion to a service high-up!

A Smart Parking facility that makes you gasp!
	
Parking of vehicles in a busy city like Colombo isnt easy. People have got used to a parking fee being collected manually when parking their vehicles. Charging of this fee is done by municipality workers or authorized private personnel. Municipality employees, in green uniforms and private employees in orange uniforms, have been engaging in collecting parking fees within the city.
The revenue generated through charging of fees, goes to the Colombo Municipal Council (CMC). However, it is learned that some issues have emerged in this regard like parking attendants having the habit of stealing money and taking money without issuing a ticket. It is also said that these parking attendants have difficulties in carrying a lot of money and as a result are inconvenienced. Motorists are also complaining that the parking attendants are
over charging them. These issues have made the CMC to think of ways to resolve these issues. 
Accordingly, the CMC initiated a programme during the tenure of former Colombo Mayor A.J.M. Muzammil (2016) to introduce parking meters within the Colombo Municipality. The project was launched in view of minimizing traffic congestion and also to put an end to errant parking and carry out a proper procedure when collecting fees. 
The Gazette notification issued on July 26, 2017 in this regard, specifies that the project was launched to make provisions for the parking of vehicles, prohibit unathorised parking, provide places for parking, impose a parking fee and establish procedures in apprehending defaulters within the administrative limits of the Colombo Municipal Council. 
Parking meters and charges
It was decided to fix the parking meters along the Galle road from Galadari roundabout up to Wellawatta city limits, Duplication Road and all by roads and connecting roads as per the provisions of Municipal Council ordinance and by-law and regulation.
One hundred (100) meters have been set up within the city, each of which has the capacity to charge fees for 20 slots.
Accordingly, Rs.10 will be charged from motorbikes per hour, Rs. 20 from three-wheelers, Rs. 30 from vans and Rs. 50 from buses and Lorries.
Tenders for the Private Public Partnership were called for by the CMC in January 2016 due to the high cost of implementing the project. Accordingly, the tender for the pilot project was awarded to a private company named Tenaga Carparks (Pvt) Ltd, which received the authority to conduct the project, the first of its kind, in Sri Lanka. 
The tender for the Smart parking for Smart City was granted for eight years with the cost of implementation borne by the project company, during which earnings are to be divided at a percentage of 40: 60. Thus, forty percent of the income is given to the Municipality, while the company takes the balance. 
The project was scheduled to commence on 2016 January 01. Until the parking meters were installed, parking wardens were deployed on a temporary basis during the first six months. (From 2016 January 01 to July 01) 
Promises to upgrade the facility
Traffic Engineer at the CMC Manjula Udalamaththe told the that people have the option of paying by cash or the mobile app (Tenaga Park Smart app) or smart parking cards. 
Since the Central bank of Sri Lanka hasnt given the approval yet for the card system, the smart parking card system isnt available. But we are hoping to establish a card payment option at the site, Udalamaththe said. 
It is true that the project does not provide every facility. The main issue highlighted by the users is that they dont receive a balance if there is any in return and also the fact that coins cant be loaded. We have discussed the issues with the private company and would provide maximum facility to users in the future, Udalamaththe added. 
It was stipulated that if a person fails to pay the relevant fee within the first hour of parking, he has to make a payment as a fine. It is learned that people have been complaining that the fine imposed due to this delay is unfair. 
After considering the above fact that the fines are unfair, the incumbent Colombo Mayor Rosy Senanayake instructed CMC Commissioner on May 18 to suspend all fines charged in connection with the parking meters. Mrs. Senanayake confirmed issuing such a directive via a tweet.
The charging of fines would be halted temporarily until necessary amendments are made. It isnt suspended forever. We will charge fines in a way that wouldnt burden people, Udalamaththe said. 
Although the project was launched with all good intention, there have been constant complaints from the general public that they arent aware of such parking meters and how they are operated. 
Exorbitant fine
The Mayors instructions came after several motorists publicly complained that they had been slapped with exorbitant fines. The authorities were forced to take note after the recent incident where a man who failed to pay a parking fee of Rs.30 at a parking slot in Wellawatte, was fined Rs.10,120, after a lapse of 13 days. 
The man had parked his car in Wellawatte on April 25 and had forgotten to pay the fee of Rs. 30 via a machine placed near the parking slot. 
The person hadnt been aware that the payment should be done via a machine. When he found that there was nobody to collect the payment, he had left the place without paying the fee, which was calculated at a rate of Rs. 30 per hour. 
After 13 days, he had been informed by the relevant institution that he had to pay a fine of Rs.10, 120 as he had neglected to pay the necessary amount. The man had paid the due amount accordingly. 
This incident reflects that people have little knowledge about these machines an how to operate them properly.
That is the very reason to suspend all fines charged relating to parking meters. It was a reasonable decision. But citizens must now see whether this whole process would be beneficial to the whole society. 
Meanwhile, a director of the Tenaga Carparks (Pvt) said that the company would always consider the welfare of the people and added that if any shortcoming occurs in terms of the parking meter machines, they would upgrade the facility. 
Earnings are to be divided at a percentage of 40: 60

There has been criticism over our mobile app not operating at times. But I say with responsibility that it is functioning fairly well and all those are rumours that are being spread to discourage the work done by our company, the director said. 
We admit the fact that the balance of payments is not paid in return. It is a known fact that the balance isnt paid at any parking meter machine in the world. But we are doing our level best to introduce a system to recover the balance payment soon, he said. 
He said that the majority of people (2800-3000) use the meters to make their payments. A few people (4%) use the mobile app to make payments. 
This incident reflects that people have little knowledge about these machines
Chairperson of the Centre for Environmental Justice, Mechanical Engineer Ravindranath Dabare told the that the parking meter project wasnt successful and wasnt operating properly. 
If its to be effective, it should be approved by the Consumer Affairs Authority (CAA). The project should come under the supervision of the CAA. It seems that the existing project isnt functioning in a proper manner, Dabare said. 
It is true that the project does not provide every facility
It wont work effectively as long as the project is merged with a private company. A project like this should be handled by a Governmental body whose objective is the welfare of the general public, Dabare added. 
This article aims at providing assistance to the people to make them fathom the comprehensive idea behind these machines and the process of using them.
The main grievance of the people is that they have little knowledge of these machines. As this is a positive move by the CMC, we would like to educate our readers as to how their meters operate.

Addressing a news briefing, the MP said Mr Rajapaksa was a respected country leader and therefore, he shouldn't be allowed to go for debates with Ministers.
Mr Rajapaksa shouldnt opt for debates with the Government about the economy, which is being handled by the likes of Arjuna Mahendran. However, we as MPs, are ready for any debate with anyone. All they have to do is make the preparations for the debate, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Australian archbishop guilty of concealing child sex abuse
	

An Australian archbishop was Tuesday found guilty of covering up child sex abuse in the 1970s -- one of the highest-ranked church officials globally to be successfully prosecuted for such offences. 
Adelaide Archbishop Philip Wilson was accused of concealing abuse by notorious paedophile priest Jim Fletcher in the New South Wales Hunter region by failing to report the allegations. 
His legal team reportedly made four attempts to have the case thrown out, arguing Wilsons diagnosis of Alzheimers should preclude him from trial -- although it did not prevent him retaining his position in the church. 
Magistrate Robert Stone found him guilty at Newcastle Local Court of concealing a serious indictable offence of another person, with the archbishop facing a maximum of two years in jail. Sentencing will be at a later date. 
There was no dispute during the hearing that Fletcher, who is now dead, sexually abused altar boy Peter Creigh, but that Wilson, then a junior priest, did nothing about it when he was told. Stone added that he did not accept Wilson could not remember a 1976 conversation in which Creigh described the abuse, saying he had no motive or interest to deceive or make up the conversation.
 
The charges laid against Wilson, in 2015, stemmed from the work of Strike Force Lantle, which since 2010 had investigated claims of child abuse concealment by former and current clergy attached to the Maitland-Newcastle Diocese of the Catholic Church. Last week, 34 Chilean bishops announced their resignation over a child sex abuse scandal.

British rugger players death: Police question trishaw drivers
	
The Fort Police questioned several trishaw drivers in connection with the deaths of two British rugger players, after a visit to a nightclub in Colombo.
Police are hoping to identify and arrest the trishaw driver, who is believed to have given brown sugar narcotics to the ruggerites, while they were on their way to the night club in Kollupitiya.
British rugby player Thomas Howard (26) and 27-year-old Thomas Baty passed away while undergoing treatment at a private hospital after complaining of breathing difficulties.
Police are on the look out for a trishaw driver after Thomas Baty had given a statement from his hospital bed, where he said that they had consumed brown sugar drugs given by the driver.
The Fort Police said they had recorded statements from several trishaw drivers and were yet to identify the wanted driver.
Police suspect the cause of the deaths to be a drug overdose, because postmortem examinations confirmed there were no external injuries nor any other illness.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

Common candidate in the making
	

A certain civil society group is said to be looking for a suitable person to be fielded as the common candidate at the big poll due in less than two years. A foreign diplomat too is behind this group.

However, the Green bucks have not taken to this idea though they have already ruled out their leader as a candidate. Meanwhile, most party seniors too have come around to the view that their second in command is the ideal choice. The eye of the civil society group on the lookout for a common candidate has now fallen on a popular figure with some 3.4 Facebook fans. An apolitical character, he has no connection to a political leader or a political party either. He is a star risen from the popular game whose fame has gone beyond our shores.
The interested diplomatic sources have pointed out to the civil society group that they could bank on this person to abolish the executive presidency. Besides, he is the candidate best suited for pitting against the charismatic onetime power behind the throne.
The star willow-wielder, already sounded about the proposition, has yet to give the nod. He is said to be currently running a lucrative business with a onetime mate as the partner, they say. The civil society activists who have already set much store by their star class find, believe that the latter, if he comes forward to contest the upcoming big poll, would receive the full backing not only of the political parties and groupings based in the North and East but also of the Reds of the New Left.

Fulfilling its commitment to impart essential life skills and knowledge amongst the public, DFCC Bank is proud to continue its impactful CSR project, Samata English, which delivered impressive results during its inaugural year in 2017. Now in the second phase, the Samata English programme is currently underway in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala. This CSR programme was conceptualized with the objective of teaching Spoken English to equip students with the knowledge required to enter into the workforce on a strong and confident footing. The second phase of the programme will benefit youth between the ages of 18-25 with improved English speaking skills over a three-month period. Education is a key pillar in DFCC Banks corporate social responsibility initiatives. In line with this, the Bank has actively supported education in the country through various initiatives over the years.
The selected students sat for an initial assessment prior to starting the course which consists of practical activities, presentations, skills development and free tutorials in classrooms with modern facilities. The English speaking course is conducted by Gateway Educational Services (Pvt) Ltd and the final assessment will also be conducted by Gateway with a CALSDA Certification.
Commenting on the success of the Samata English programme, Lakshman Silva  CEO, DFCC Bank said, Being able to speak in English is crucial for youth in order to succeed in the local or international job markets. DFCC Bank launched Samata English to bridge the spoken English skills gap. A pilot project was held last year in the Kalutara and Gampaha areas, which was very successful and it was encouraging to see the trained youth scoring high in spoken English skills as a direct influence of the programme. Encouraged by the improved confidence and positive outlook that this programme instilled in the youth in Gampaha and Kalutara last year, we are pleased to continue the programme in 2018 as well. This year, we are focusing on youth in Galle, Kandy and Kurunegala to help them fulfil their professional aspirations.
In operation for over six decades, DFCC Bank remains dedicated to advancing financial inclusivity whilst supporting the growth and development of the nation. The bank continuously strives to create sustainable value for all stakeholders and provide its valued customers with a comprehensive range of innovative financial solutions.

## Title: GOTABAYAS BREAKTHROUGH

GOTABAYAS BREAKTHROUGH
	
When a future historian writes the political history of the most obtuse and inept government in postcolonial Sri Lanka, he or she will doubtless identify its most myopic move as the Constitutional prevention of Mahinda Rajapaksa running for President again, thereby opening the door for the fulfilment of the worst fear of the neoliberal cosmopolitan democrats, namely a Gotabhaya candidacy. 
A pivotal moment will be identified as May 18, 2018, when TV audiences watched the quasi-martial Pongu Thamil optics from Mullivaikkal (black uniforms, motorcycle parade with red and black flags, school flags at half mast, mobilized school-kids) and heard Chief Minister Wigneswarans resolution declaring Tamil Genocide Day. The real meaning of Mullivaikkal 2018 was translated for us by the countrys highest qualified academic, Prof. Ratnajeevan S. Hoole: 
LTTE supporters had taken it over, and played Eelamist songs. People we could not see for the crowds gave hysterical speeches about the day that their dreams of Eelam were snuffed out.(Mullivaikkal: A Burgeoning Movement,CT, May 20, 2018) 
Tiger separatists are back in our face while the State is in retreat, nine years after we won the war. In 2015 the Tamils and Muslims voted as blocs. In 2019 it may be the Sinhalese.Thus, the Gotabhayan moment may be arriving. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa broke through enemy lines on May 13 and secured the toughest of objectives. He liberated Colombos capitalist class from its traditional party, the UNP, at a time the UNP is in government (and Mahinda is not even the Leader of the Opposition). This had been done only once beforein 1994 when Chandrika Bandaranaike Kumaratunga won the bourgeoisie over from the UNP. Mahindas unmatched appeal and his brother Basils organizational mastery had reduced the UNP to 32% on Feb 10th 2018. Now, Mahindas other brother Gotabaya, the masterful manager of the military victory over Tiger terrorism, had just drilled through the UNPs bourgeois base in the citadel itself, Colombo, and administered the sociological coup de grace at the Shangri-La hotels largest hall. The Rajapaksa brothers have scythed away the UNP at its base and apex; its feet and head. 
Gotabaya Rajapaksa broke through enemy lines on May 13 and secured the toughest of objectives
The dynamics and discourse at the Shangri-La clearly confirmed that Mahinda was still The Man.The paradox and the problem is that unless the 19th Amendment is modified (to include the term consecutive), The Man can never be the President. 
The social move to Gotabaya denotes a deeper change. The minoritarianism,economic decline and patronizing Western postures of post-2015 neoliberal democracy,triggered a tectonic shift of social consciousness to a strong State, strong patriotic leadership and tougher-mindedness on the economic, ethnic and foreign policy fronts, similar to Russias shift to Putin after the disastrous pro-Western liberalism of the 1990s,and shifts in India, Turkey and the Philippines to Modi,Erdogan and Duterte respectively. While I have little problem accommodating such shifts and would welcome some of them,two things worry me. 
One is that strident Tamil political adventurism has generated an Alt-Right mood and momentum among all classes in the South, rendering society ripe for a Netanyahu-Trump type turn/pushback. Decades after the Tamil elite led the way to sectarianism, followed by Cyril Mathew, Gamini Jayasuriyas SAS, Hela Urumaya, DUNF, and Sihala Urumaya, there is an affluent bilingual Sinhala elite (not merely the lower middle classes) including in the Diaspora, which has converted to a New Right neoconservative nationalism. 
My second concern is the economic policy model that was rolled-out at the Shangri-La by Gotabaya. As a high-growth strategy on the right flank of the Mahinda coalition, under Mahindas leadership i.e. a sub-set of a larger Mahinda policy paradigm, it would be fine. However, as a stand-alone model or the dominant (Presidential) one, it will generate major structural contradictions, triggering a cycle of conflict. 
The GR model as unveiled at Viyath Maga gave no importance to poverty, the peasantry, landlessness, inequity, poverty reduction, and social upliftment.It had no place for the people or social justice. The goal was high economic growth with law and order. Social questions and public welfare were conspicuously absent and the assumption seemed to be trickle down. The vision is socially thin, ungrounded; a holographic projection with little social thickness, inclusivity, depth or rootedness in complex social reality. 
This paradigm is a throwback to the ASEAN modelof the UNP of the 1980s-- particularly the ideology of Lalith Athulathmudali in the 80s. Athulathmudali was close to Reaganite Republicans, a friend of hawkish US Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger, had taught in Israel and Singapore, held tough rightwing views on economics,student protest, the ethnic issue and foreign policy and pushed the Israeli (Occupied Territories)model for the Tamil Question. 
The UNPs economic doctrine produced an early-1980s high growth bubble. The governing elite ignored the warnings of Prime Minister Premadasa about poverty and inequity. He tabled the Warnasena Rasaputram Report on Poverty, building on a UNICEF study. The prevailing economic and (authoritarian) political model caused a volcanic insurrection by underprivileged youth. A top-down technocratic model did not work in Sri Lanka in the 1950swhen it triggered the August 1953 Hartal-- orin the 1980s despite the heavy law and order fist of the Jayewardene-Athulathmudaliregime. 
Translated into SLFP history, Gotabayas vision is like that of Felix Dias Bandaranaike in the 1970s, representing the SLFP Right rather than the Rajapaksian centre-left, progressive Populism. 
The paradigm generates contradictions and resistance along three axial routes: 
(I) The South-South axis, where social insensitivity,inequity and structural marginalization will trigger clashes with students, workers, peasants, fisherfolk and neighbourhood communities. 
(II) The North-South axis, where tokenistic integrationism/assimilationism in place of a geopolitically sustainable political equation, will render the Tamil Question utterly intractable. 
(III) The Democracy-Autocracy axis, where the top-down technocratic model itself requires authoritarianism (Felix called it a little bit of totalitarianism) and will thereby erode legitimacy and trigger resistance. 
Gotabaya surely can and must do better. The people are the nation. Any truly national project must be a peoples project. So far, this is not a peoples project. It lacks a social soul. The proven successes described in Dr. Nalaka Godahewas speech at the Shangri-La are the economic models of Presidents Premadasa and Rajapaksa (both of whom Dr. P.B. Jayasundara worked with). 
Neville Jayaweera, one of the most distinguished products of the elite Ceylon Civil Service in the post-Independence years, made this comparative evaluation of Premadasas vision, 16 years after his assassination: The soaring vision he had for his country, and I do not mean merely for the Sinhala people but for Sri Lanka as a nation, was unmatched by any political leader of the last century, either conceptually, or in terms of the intelligence and managerial energy with which he backed it up(Unmasking Premadasa, Sunday Observer, Jan 11, 2009) 
The secret of Premadasas development vision was that it was inclusive, consultative and bottom-up, and as he called it, peoplised: 
Whatever development we may bring about should be to the benefit of the poor. Development in any sense should help people live...If technology cannot eliminate poverty, unemployment, want, we have no need for that technology. If the scientist and the technologist cannot provide relief to the poor, what need has humanity for such a scientist or technologist!(Providing Assets to the Asset-less, 13.2. 89) 
What sort of Sri Lanka do we want to create What sort of motherland do we want to leave for our children We must strive to build a fair society for all. This means a society in which everyone is provided with the tools and the opportunity for advancement. The tools the State must provide are security, education, social justice, access to opportunity. (Annual Conference of the Judicial Service Association ofSri Lanka, 30.11.90) 
Any leader can apply this successful paradigm,if they have the heart to do it.

Government targets US $ 2.7bn FDI this year: Malik
	
The governments target is to attract foreign direct investment (FDI) worth US $ 2.7 billion this year, Development Strategies and International Trade Minister Malik Samarawickama told Parliament yesterday.
He said the country has attracted foreign direct investments worth US $ 1.9 billion in 2017.
Minister said the Board of Investments (BOI) has already approved several projects that would help the government to meet the US $ 2.7 billion investment target.
The projects Samrawickrama mentioned included two liquefied natural gas (LNG) power plants and one offshore LNG platform.India and Japan will invest in these projects, he stressed.
The minister further said a cement factory will also come in.
Joint Opposition MP Dr. Ramesh Pathirana asked for a value breakdown of foreign direct investments that are expected to come into the country this year, but Samarawickrama said he cannot give them off hand.
Meanwhile, Samarawickrama dismissed allegations made by the Joint Opposition over the recently inked Sri Lanka-Singapore Free Trade Agreement.
He said the FTA has no provisions to allow Singapore to provide employment in Sri Lanka for expatiate of other countries other than Singaporeans. Also he said Singaporean nationals will be allowedto work in Sri Lanka only in the companies set up under the FTA.
We have also included a clause in the FTA which provides provisions to review the agreement after one year, and I invite the trade chambers and others to show us the areas which we might have to change when the review is done, he added.(Yohan Perera and Ajith Siriwardene)

He has fallen between two stools
	

There is a certain character who happens to be a long-standing spokesman for those employed in the Samurdhi department in the country. An activist of Pohottuwa from its very inception, the man is now a provincial council member having his political base in an area close to the city.

Recently, this Samurdhi man had decided to throw in his lot with Number One for working out a private agenda of his own and later, on the sly called on the latter at his office. However, some of his erstwhile Samurdhi colleagues who had seen him meeting Number One had reported this strange meeting to the Pohottuwa bigwigs. Meanwhile, his estranged former colleagues had also made a strong appeal to Number One not to entertain this man.
Number One had later in response to Samurdhi employees appeal had closed the door of his office to any future visits of the self-seeking Samurdhi spokesman.
The disappointed Samurdhi man is said to be working hard for Pohottuwa again with a new gusto. But the party high-ups knowing his recent attempted pole-vault to yahapalanaya are giving him the cold shoulder, they say.

His bluster was in vain
	

A gangling deputy from an area North of the upcountry main city went gung ho in the recent past and began taking potshots at his leader practically from every political platform. His grouse was that the boss failed to concede a place in the top team for a deserving one from his district. Of course, he meant himself when he referred to a deserving one.

Being a member of a prominent political family for several generations in the district, the politico had reason to believe that sooner or later he would be raised to top team status.
So, when he received a telephone call from his political boss the other day asking him to see him immediately, the man thought that his long-cherished dream had come true!
So, he called on the boss post-haste. As soon as he showed up, the boss went into a long harangue reminding him of a long list of wrongs he had committed including making statements to media criticizing the party leadership. Giving him no chance to a make a reply, the boss added in a firm tone: You can rest assured you will never get a place in the top team!
A highly dejected politico had left the place sadder, but much wiser, they say.

Kerosene sales down 400% with price hike: Minister
	
Kerosene sales have declined by a whopping 400 percent since the removal of the kerosene subsidy this month, indicating large scale abuse of kerosene for adulteration of more expensive distillates and greater industrial use of the fuel, Petroleum Resources Development Minister Arjuna Ranatunga announced yesterday.
Speaking at the launch of the ministrys new website, Ranatunga said bus and lorry owners particularly substituted kerosene for diesel and other fuels due to subsidised kerosene prices.
The government hiked fuel prices early this month for the first time since 2015, and the Cabinet approved a pricing formula that will re-price fuel prices every two months going forward.
Accordingly, the price of a petrol litre was increased by Rs.20 and diesel by Rs.14. The biggest increase was effected on kerosene, jacking up the price to Rs.101 from Rs.44.

Mangala says 49, 000 new tax files opened in April
	
Sri Lankas Inland Revenue Department (IRD) has opened 49,000 new tax files in April with the New Inland Revenue Act coming into force, Finance and Mass Media Minister Mangala Samaraweera revealed yesterday.
Addressing a special press conference, which coincidentally marked the completion of one year in his current position, Samaraweera noted that the governments tax revenue base has been on a growing trend as the public are coming to terms with their responsibilities.
Speaking to Mirror Business, the Commissioner General of the Department of Inland Revenue (IRD), Ivan Dissanayake said the IRD has set a target to open 250,000 new tax files this year.
Dissanayake futher said the new tax files were opened based on the information gathered during February to March period.
We havent estimated the income yet. They have time to make the payment until September 2019. However, we are expecting some payments from the new files this year, Dissanayake said.
The public have understood their responsibilities and have come forward voluntarily to pay their due taxes, he added.
Meanwhile, Minister Samaraweera vowed to increase expenditure on education and health to 6 percent of GDP by 2025 and 3.5 percent of GDP over the next couple of years.
He pointed out that Yahapalana government has been steadily increasing expenditure on education, health and housing since it came into power in 2015. Despite many challenges, the Yahaplana government increased expenditure on education to Rs.257 billion in 2017 from Rs 190 billion in 2014. Expenditure on health has been increased to Rs.197 billion from Rs.138 while expenditure on housing has sharply increased to Rs.274 billion from Rs.174 billion.
The minister revealed that the Enterprise Sri Lanka loan scheme will be launched on June 27 and the Enterprise Sri Lanka exhibition will be kicked off in Embilipitiya in August while the groundbreaking Gamperaliya rural development programme is also set to be launched in August.
Meanwhile, Samaraweera accused former President Mahinda Rajapaksa and his followers of spreading fake news on the economy, cost of living and the debt situation following Goebbels Big Lie Theory.
Samaraweera asserted that the government has set a solid foundation for a stronger economy, referring to several economic indicators.
The governments tax revenue has increased to 12.6 percent of GDP from 10.3 percent; the governments revenue has increased to 13.8 percent of GDP from 12.6 percent while the government managed to retain expenditure at 19.4 percent of GDP and 5 percent of government investments.
Primary account surplus was recorded last year since 1992. We are expecting that the surplus will further increase in mid-term. We believe there will be a surplus in the current account this year. Accordingly, we will be able to cover all recurring expenditures through the government revenue, he said
Samaraweera noted that the debt to GDP ratio has fallen to 77.6 percent in 2017 from 78.8 in 2016 and the government is in the process of paying off loans taken by the former regime for the next 12 years. He accused the former president of fabricating the real debt scenario of the country to the public.
Samaraweera challenged Rajapaksa to face him as the former finance minister in a public debate to discuss and settle the debt issue once and for all.
According to him, the government will have to pay off Rs 11.4 trillion worth of loans acquired mostly by the past regime. He stressed that almost half of the loans acquired by the present government were for the interest payments for the loans acquired prior to 2015.
Despite the criticism levelled against the current government, Samaraweera stated that the expenditure on Samurdhi and other transfer payment programmes for underprivileged communities has been increased to 3.4 percent of GDP from 3.1percent and the government also was able to increase the salaries of state employees in 2015 by Rs.10, 000, which was the first salary increase since 2006.
When the Rs.10,000 salary increase is converted according to 2014, its a 107 percent increase in January, 2020, he said.
Speaking of the cost of living, Samaraweera insisted that the cost of living has not exceeded the 2014 levels while adding that the income levels of the citizens have increased steadily during the period as Sri Lanka became an upper-middle country in 2017, reaching US $4,065 in per capita income.

Meghans father is seen for first time since missing wedding
	

DAILY MAIL,22 May 2018 - Shoulders slumped, shuffling, and clutching a plastic bag marked personal possessions, this is Meghan Markles father pictured two days after the Royal Wedding as he returned homefrom hospital. 

Exclusive photos were taken in his adopted hometown of Rosarito, Mexico, where he is recovering from a heart operation. 
Thomas Markle Sr had initially hoped to make the ceremony, which took place on Saturday morning, but was forced to pull out after allegedly suffering a heart attack last week. 
On Wednesday, he was admitted to hospital for an operation to insert three stents.
Since being released from medical supervision, Markle Sr has been staying with friends in a different gated compound a few miles from his home. 
He returned to his San Antonio Del Mar property Monday - driven in by a friend, single mom Lori Davis, 38, with whom he has previously been pictured enjoying a dinner date. 
At some point, Markle Sr surprisingly stopped at a Starbucks drive-thru and appeared to walk away with a Frappuccino in hand, whipped cream and chocolate on the top, despite the 73-year-old having heart surgery last week. 
His return home came days after Meghan walked down the aisle accompanied for part of it by her new father-in-law Prince Charles. 
Markle Sr is understood to have watched the ceremony, later pronouncing it joyful and emotional in an interview.

Orchid Malabe: An ideal residence for bird lovers
	
With over 10,500 identified species, birds are found in all corners of the world. Each species is unique and able to survive in a huge range of environments. And Sri Lanka is one of those countries where you can find many species of birds especially during their migration period. Birds just like animals have love and feelings, using different interesting ways to grab attention from their partners- through sounds, chirping rhythms, dance, and fights to win over their competition, and so on. There are plenty of bird lovers amongst us locals here and residing at a location where we get to experience this is just stunning.
Birds habitats are slowly destroyed due to high infrastructure developments and commercialization of cities including urbanization all around the world and its the same case with Sri Lanka. However, the Orchid project at Malabe by Nivasie and ICC has made every effort in preserving this beautiful environment with a perfect balance, giving more weightage and space surrounded by greenery. And yes, if you are a resident you are definitely natures lover, more like birds lover- landscaped parks, natural water bodies, paddy fields and all natural vegetation give serene sanctuary to number of varieties of birds.
Though the project is situated at a highly commercialized city, residents at the luxury housing project Orchid Malabe barely feels that he or she is in a busy, noisy city as the environment is just so calm and peaceful, making it an ideal residence for a responsible, sustainable living.
Interestingly, the project is in a very close proximity to the Thalangama Wetland Sanctuary which is widely regarded as a spot to make bird watching a hobby. The diversity of this wetland is remarkable with over 100 species of birds and a numerous species of butterflies and dragonflies. It includes a variety of water birds namely common moorhen, little cormorant, median egrets, little egret, purple heron, gray heron, pond heron, magpie robin, red watted lapwing, black crowned night heron, little grebe among others.
The wetland is also resident to four species of Kingfishers- Pied Kingfisher, Common Kingfisher, White-throated Kingfisher and the Stork-billed Kingfisher which is by far the largest Kingfisher in the country. The location is a stop by for birds making their journey to the southern coast during their migrant season. Some migrants include golden plover, lesser sand plover, common sandpiper, common greenshank, wood sandpiper, kenish plover and black wing stilt. many species of forest birds including green imperial pigeon, spotted dove, greater coucal, rose ringe parakeet, Asian koel, Indian scopes owl, brown hawk owl, little green bee-eater, Ceylon small barbet, Indian pigmy woodpecker, etc.
More interestingly residents can just wake up to a walk at the newly built jogging track at Chandrika Bandaranayake Kumaratunga Mw, a long two and a half kilometer track runs from Malabe New Kandy Road to Pinketha Junction just 500m away from Orchid Malabe, where everyone get to experience many species that were mentioned before. Fresh air keeps blowing over the paddy fields all the time, giving those walking the perfect environment during the day, even at night the track is fully lit using solar power.
Its almost impossible to see over a hundred species of birds in a day even in the endemic rainforest such as Yala which provides a matrix of habitats. But here in this area youre assured of coming across more than 70 species of birds within few hours. Thalangama Wetlands urban location demonstrates how rich a wildlife refuge it is and how precious it is as an educational and recreational resource for Colombos growing population. And Orchid Malabe sets its mark to be an ideal residence to all bird lovers. For more information visit www.orchidbynivasie.com.

President Maithripala Sirisena had agreed to appoint an economic committee headed by Chief Economist Prof. Lalith Samarakoon to look into the Free Trade Agreement (FTA) inked with Singapore, the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) today said.
GMOA Spokesman Dr Samantha Ananda told the Daily Mirror that President Sirisena had guaranteed to appoint said committee during a discussion held on Tuesday with the GMOA-membership over the FTA with Singapore.
The FTA ran into a storm after the GMOA protested against it and created a controversy.
Accordingly, the economic committee is expected to look into this matter and the parties concerned can submit their views to this committee.
President Sirisena has also assured to revoke the FTA if it would be proven detrimental to the country following the findings of the committee, he said.
He said the GMOA had also stressed the need to get such trade agreements approved by people through a referendum and added that obtaining the two-thirds majority in Parliament would not suffice to enter into such agreements.
He also said the country should have a National Policy on International Trade agreements prior to entering into such FTAs.
We have informed President Sirisena that the opinion of the professional bodies including the lawyers and engineers have not been taken before entering into the FTA with Singapore despite it being an agreement to open the Service Sector of the country to the world, he said.
He said Development Strategies and International Trade Ministry Secretary Chandani Wijewardana, who was also a party to the discussion, had revealed that steps had been taken to enter into few more trade agreements with Thailand, Indonesia and Malaysia. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Rs. 2379 mn collected as fines for traffic offences last year
	
A revenue of Rs. 2379 million had been collected and credited to the consolidated fund by the Police as fines from traffic offences across the country last year, Police informed Law and Order Minister Ranjith Madduma Bandara.
This was revealed at a special discussion held under the patronage of Minister Madduma Bandara to find urgent solutions to the heavy traffic congestion in Colombo. It was revealed that in Colombo alone Rs. 278 million were collected by the police for traffic offences committed.
However, the minister told the officials that while these statistics were indeed impressive a better way to reduce congestion in the City of Colombo would be discipline motorists and to develop and modernise the transport system in the country. Those present were asked to come up with medium and long term solutions to the problem.
At the discussion, it was revealed that there was a shortage of about 350 police officers to be used for traffic control. The minister said he would instruct the IGP to take the necessary steps to fill the void.
When minister asked why the proposed methodology of reducing marks over ill-discipline was not implemented, the police informed him that the system was not implemented due to a glitch when accessing data from the computer network between the Department of Motor Traffic, the Courts and the Police Department.
The minister directed the relevant officials to immediately take steps to correct this shortcoming.
Ministry Secretary Padmasiri Jayamanne, Chairman of the Road Development Authority Nihal Sooriaarachchi, officials from the Moratuwa University and DIGs and a senior officers of the Police Traffic Division attended the meeting.(Darshana Sanjeewa)

## Title: SL Likely to Introduce Electronic Registration for Land Registries

SL Likely to Introduce Electronic Registration for Land Registries
	
This article refers to the article published in the Daily Mirror titled Govt. to introduce online property registration service published on April 11, 2018. (http://www.dailymirror.lk/148557/Govt-to-introduce-online-property-registration-service)
According to this newspaper article, the government is introducing an online property registration service with the aim of moving up the Ease of Doing Business Index of the World Bank in 2019.
This is a very important and necessary step for Sri Lanka. However, we must not ignore the fact that the integrity of the electronic register depends on the validity of thousands of notarized documents that are lodged daily at the registry to alter data of the e-Registry; the ownership details of existing owners [ transfers, mortgages, leases etc] 
It need not be mentioned that all such notarised documents must be free of forgery or fraud. In Sri Lanka land fraud is extremely pervasive. Therefore we need to be more receptive to the place we occupy in the Global Fraud Index - [G F I].
This is a very important and necessary step for Sri Lanka. However, we must not ignore the fact that the integrity of the electronic register depends on the validity of thousands of notarized documents that are lodged daily at the registry to alter data of the e-Registry; the ownership details of existing owners [ transfers, mortgages, leases etc]
The e-Register operates with a new law that does not permit landowners easy access to court if their ownership is affected by fraud or forgery. 
The law which was practised in developing countries for over 150 years known as title registration has been introduced to Sri Lanka to operate with the electronic register. All landowners must be receptive to the operation of Act 21 of 1998, which introduced this law under Bim Saviya/ Title registration. The main principle under the law is that it does not permit judicial intervention to adjudicate matters relating to fraudulent transactions entered in the E register . 
For example Arjuna was the registered owner of a plot of land . His signature was forged by a fraudster and land was sold to David. Davids name gets registered as the new owner in the e- register. Arjuna has no right to access court to get relief. [Section 33 of Act 21 of 1998. ] 
It is undeniable that Title registration Act 21 of 1998 [Bim Saviya] law inherently and necessarily includes a risk  the risk is that the title can be defeated by a fraudulent transaction which once registered gains priority and eliminates the previous registered owner. The person defrauded is left to seek financial compensation from an Assurance Fund . 
The e-Register is considered a conclusive register, works on the principle of indefeasibility of title. This saves a person who is buying and mortgaging land the trouble and expense of searching the register to investigate the history of an owners title. The downfall for Sri Lanka is to let the electronic conveyancing process to be implemented by those who have no formal legal training of the deed and the title registration systems. The World Bank mentioned in their report No. ICR0000190 Implementation completion and results Report of March 22, 2007. Report said ----that The Project failed to deal with titling of land parcels where there was uncertainty about existing rights.. Report expressed the need for research. 
Daily news staff writer in New York, in the USA demonstrates the speed of registering forged documents in the e-Register. (http://www.nydailynews.com/news/money/90-minutes-daily-news-steal-empire-state-building-article-1.353477 )
The story written by William Sherman a Daily news staff writer in New York shows how an important building such as the Empire State Building can be stolen in 90 minutes with a sale document with forged signatures via the e-Register. 
The Daily News NY prepared a bogus sale documents to transfer the Empire State Building by forging the signatures of the owner of the Empire State Land Associates and transferred the property to Nelots Properties LLC. (Nelots is stolen spelled backwards). 
The land registry overlooked the identity of the notary and the witnesses and registered the deed . This was laughable as the notarys name was given as the famous bank robber Willie Sutton, the original King Kong star Fay Wray was given as a witness. 
The sale was registered in 90 minutes, a speed that is expected from the Electronic register. By this experimental transaction the Daily News demonstrated the weakness of the law relating to identification and verification of owners.
Who bears the loss for title theft under title registration system and electronic register
The US system had not changed to title registration. Therefore, the register was rectified and the owners name, Empire State Land Associates was entered back into the register. 
If this took place in Sri Lanka under the Act 21 of 1998, the owner would have no right to access court and Nelots Properties LLC could remain the owner. 
In such a scenario, the true owner of Empire State Land Associates may receive compensation to the value decided accordingly from an Assurance Fund. The Assurance Fund is a Statutory Assurance Fund which provides a new scheme for landowners to obtain monetary compensation for the loss of land rights. All lands are insured without a premium under this system.
Judicial errors in interpreting law under title registration/ Electronic register
The Judiciaries of developing countries that recently introduced the law are trying to cope with law on Title registration, Sri Lanka has not had this experience yet . The first judgment relating to rights under the electronic register was delivered by the judiciary of Malaysia where a fraudulent deed was registered displacing the true owner. The Judge of the Federal Court of Malaysia had to deal with the restrictions placed on the Judiciary in a the classic case in Adorna Properties Sdn Bhd v Boonsom Boonyanit[2001] 2CLJ 133 Azrin Hafiz / Sept 2012 - Jan 2013.
The judge held in favour of the registered owner Adorna Properties, the company that registered the land forging the owners signature, displacing the rightful owner Boonsom Boonyanit from the electronic register . This came as a shock to the landowners of Malaysia and the lawyers . 
The first Federal court decision is an eye opener for Sri Lanka and highlights the pitfalls faced by bona fide owners under title registration system. The decision of this case continued for 10 years, where landowners of Malaysia had to lose their land rights to fraudulent owners until it was overruled after 10 years . 
International treatises introduce e-Registration and new laws [Bim Saviya]
There should be willingness by those who make the major changes to Property Law to research and introduce the ancillary laws that are essential to support the changes. Sri Lanka unfortunately had not introduced the practices and laws that are governing Solicitors, Notaries and Registries of countries which operate these systems successfully [Australia, New Zealand, UK etc]
The Information Communication Agency , Survey Department and the Land Registry had concentrate on identifying and surveying land according to high tech methods. Other nations have simultaneously adopted high tech methods to record the identity of owners of lands, to protect the integrity of the e-Register . 
Land Registry in India - the finger prints being taken to verify and identify the owner before land transactions are registered 
Mobile alert Land registry sends mobile alerts to owners before registering in the e-Registry similar to bank transactions. 
What can be done by land owners and purchasers to protect their land right
When ownership enters the computer, be cautious!
1 Obtain a title report from your notary, if extracts are damaged get them reconstructed, register the names of all the heirs if the owners are not living  this is essential as the legal checking process of ownership rights to enter the owners names to the electronic register is not administered by those with a knowledge of property law and conveyancing in Sri Lanka.
2 Retain the original deeds and the old original paper documents after the registration in the E register. 
3 Obtain an extract from the land registry with the final entry after the ownership is recorded in the electronic register. 
If you are buying land, the Title registration law may grant relief to protect your rights if you have the following documents, if you become a victim of fraud or forgery. 
1 A sale takes place under the new system with the Notary perfecting forms which are statutory forms, deeds are not executed . Once the form is accepted by the Registrar the owner will receive a computer print out depicting the ownership in lieu of a deed. Request a copy of the form which the Notary submitted to the registry as the computer printout does not contain all the information relating to the sale of the land, such as the consideration paid, signatures of owner and buyer etc, to protect your rights against fraud. 
(The Prevention of Frauds Ordinance requires all notarised documents to be in duplicate) 
2 Identify the owner when purchasing land, if a fraudulent entry enters the e-Register the onus is on you to prove that maximum due diligence was used to purchase the land from the genuine owner. Take a photograph, retain identity verification documents of the owner witnesses and brokers, obtain full names, ID numbers of those who participated in your transaction, obtain their personal addresses, home addresses telephone numbers and keep a photo identity of the owner. 
The e-Register is considered a conclusive register, works on the principle of indefeasibility of title. This saves a person who is buying and mortgaging land the trouble and expense of searching the register to investigate the history of an owners title
Some may argue that seeing and recording the owners ID is sufficient. This is not. Land transactions require the same bar for identifying owners which is high in the banking Insurance passport sectors. Identification checks carried out by Sri Lankan banks today comply with all the Know Your Customer Rules prescribed by the Central Bank, which are not optional. The banks retain all the documents of identity for future reference. 
3 Be present at the time of signing documents, obtain receipts for money paid . 
4 Powers of Attorney: Personally contact the owner before buying land. 
Committee appointed by Ministry of Justice to amend Notaries Ordinance
The committee recommended bio-metric methods and the retention of photographs at the time of signing documents by Notaries in order to identify the parties who sign as owners and witnesses. In Sri Lanka there is in some quarters a social mind block that fingerprinting is a regression to the colonial times when illiterates were required to provide their fingerprints. This misconceived notion prevented, the electronic revolution for identifying parties to land transactions and the amendment to the Notaries Ordinance.

Those were the Halcyon days of our country when Ministers were respected; in fact, THEY WERE GIVEN THE RESPECT THEY SO RIGHTLY DESERVED!!!
More importantly, the people of this country respected each other; neither caste, creed nor religion, divided them!!! Is it any wonder then that the country was known as PARADISE In 1972 the new Republican Constitution came into being and Lanka was re-namedSRI LANKA!!!
BUT, IT WAS IN 1978 WHEN THE POWERFUL EXECUTIVE PRESIDENCY WAS CREATED AND J.R.J. BECAME THE ALL POWERFUL EXECUTIVE PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY THAT THE DEATH KNELL OF OUR COUNTRY WAS SOUNDED!!!
That was when CORRUPTION started when the fight for power WAS RELENTLESS!!! 1983 SAW THE COUNTRY SPLINTERED, TORN APART WITH THE EELAM WAR!!! This despicable war, while claiming the lives of countless, citizens and Ministers alike also caused division, separation and most of all hatred among our people!!!
Missing discipline
As is happening in most countries of the world today, our people are also ruinously divided. They think nothing of killing, raping, stealing, dishonouring, and most often ignoring the precepts of Buddhism that bind this country together!!! The people are sadly unable to look up to their leaders for guidance on how to walk the correct path!!! We have no one to set examples for our people to follow!!! Therefore, the end result is mayhem and absolute chaos!!! The people see all the fraudsters who have swindled billions, being dealt with leniently; so the attitude is, WHY SHOULD WE BOTHER We are just small fish compared to the ones who have defrauded!!!
Therefore, we now have a society that doesnt care, a society that does not have a correct sense of values, people who act without a conscience, people who think nothing of stealing, fathers who rape their own children, school children who do not know the meaning of discipline, and parents who murder their own children!!! Topping the list are some of the guardians of Buddhism in this country!!!
Recently, in a village to which one of the Ministers goes for advice to a Buddhist Priest, a woman had taken the noon dana for the Monk and he thanked her by raping her!!! We cannot, of course, forget the merchants, traders and other dealers who think nothing of stealing and defrauding the common man!!! That happens on a day to day basis!!!
Charity
Is there a single person in this day and age, in our country, who can be upheld as an example Lets take a look at some heroes and magnanimous people in the world!!! The famous footballer Cristiano Ronaldo donates blood regularly; he played at the request of the FCA to help 42 people in Madeira, who were affectedby floods.
Donated his Golden Boot worth Euros 5 million to the Palestinian children in Gaza in 2012. In 2013 he donated his Ballon dOr Trophy to charity raising Pounds 600,000/- for Make A Wish Foundation.
In 2014, Ronaldo not only donated items but also paid $83,000/- for the operation of a 10-month-old infant in need!!!. He was acclaimed as the MOST CHARITABLE ATHLETE OF THE YEAR for going above and beyond the call of charity work. His charity work never ends and he says: We dont need to tell our dream, we must show them. Like Mother Theresa of Calcutta, who persisted in her charity until her death!!! She often pleaded with women not to kill, abort or throw their children away  she often used to say If you dont want them, give them to me. Her CHARITY CONTINUES TO THIS DAY!!! There are many more like them, but what I am trying to say is, numerous Foundations, Charitable Trusts etc., are found in our country but most end up being caught up in corruption, stealing, and more often than not, with the Trustees helping themselves and not the cause!!!
Harrys example
Looking back on the recent Royal Wedding, we learned that both Prince William and Prince Harry have done duty, though they are Royals, William as a Search and Rescue Helicopter Pilot and Harry served up front in Afghanistan when a media blackout was imposed to protect him!!!. He returned and after learning to fly helicopters, like his brother, Harry went back to Afghanistan for another stint of duty, this time without the protection of a media blackout!!! Our Forces can lay claim to putting their lives on the line in the call of duty, but can any one of our so-called elite; Ministers or VIPs say the same They dont become Ministers to serve, Oh no; they become Ministers TO BE SERVED!!! Apparently, that is their right!!!
No pension for MPs
This is what should be applied to our Parliamentarians!!! They should NOT get a pension since it is NOT EMPLOYMENT BUT ELECTION UNDER PEOPLES REPRESENTATION ACT!!! There is no retirement with a bar on reemployment; they can get reelected to the same position again and again!!! Parliamentarians pay should be revised in line with the Central Pay Commission. They keep increasing their salaries by voting for themselves!!!
Parliamentarians should lose their current Health Care System and participate in the same Health Care System as the general public of Sri Lanka!!! All the concessions they enjoy free travel, rations, electricity, water, phone bills etc., should be abolished!!!
They boldly and shamelessly keep increasing the quantum of these concessions!!! Parliamentarians with tainted records, criminal charges and convictions, past or present should be summarily banned from Parliament and contesting elections on any pretext!!! Financial losses incurred due to politicians in office must be recovered from their families, nominees, properties!!!
Parliamentarians should EQUALLY ABIDE BY ALL LAWS THEY IMPOSE ON THE GENERAL PUBLIC!!!
No surrender of subsidies like LPG by citizens unless all subsidies available to MPs are withdrawn including subsidized food in the Parliament canteen. Retirement age should be 60 years for Politicians too. Our Parliamentarians should realize and adhere to one Golden Rule SERVING IN PARLIAMENT IS AN HONOUR, NOT A LUCRATIVE CAREER FOR LOOTING!!!

STRIKING DOCTORS: GOODNESS, GRACIOUS ME!
	
As the daughter and granddaughter of doctors, who were leading doctors of their time, I am ashamed of the way doctors of the Government Medical Officers Association (GMOA) are behaving and have been for some time.
Doctors have been the beneficiaries of a free medical training but seize any opportunity to go on strike or go slow
	Forgotten the Hippocratic Oath they took when they became doctors after the free medical training they had
They have been the beneficiaries of a free medical training, but instead seize any opportunity to go on strike or go slow.
Who suffers when they do None other than the poor and underprivileged, who cannot afford to go to private hospitals or to doctors who are private practitioners.
The rich and the privileged do not suffer as they are able to afford private medical care.
Some of these doctors who are leading these strikes and inciting others to follow their example have been seen going in and out of the office of the former ruler leading the JO, so he and his party are supporting and encouraging these strikes.
By doing so, they are also responsible for the suffering, that the poor have to endure and sometimes face death, as a result of strike action by doctors.
The PM and the President must instil more discipline in both parties, in public servants and speed up the process of punishing those who milked the country dry
The doctors who are striking, seem to have forgotten the Hippocratic Oath they took when they became doctors after the free medical training they had.
This oath is a formal promise that they would do everything possible to help their patients, ease suffering and have high moral medical ethics.
I fail to comprehend how they can strike after taking this oath. Im glad that there are some doctors who I respect, who have firmly refused to join or support any strike action.
Sarath Fonseka
We also read the ridiculous statement made by the former ruler, that animals would run into hiding, as Field Marshall Fonseka was made the Minister responsible for Wild Life.
I am surprised that someone, who was once the President of the country could make this kind of childish comments.
Many have expressed the opinion, that perhaps he was echoing his own thoughts as to what he, his family and his cohorts would have done if the Field Marshall was made Minister of Law and Order.
I, for one, think Sarath Fonseka should have been made Minister for Law and Order.
It was he who led the country to victory in the war, against terrorism, on the battlefield, although others took the credit and continue to bask in the reflected glory of that victory.
He would most certainly, have taken swifter action against all those guilty of violence, murder and corruption during those horrific years of rule of the former government. One of the main criticisms against this government is that nothing has been done to punish those who ran havoc, ignoring the rule of law, behaved as if the country was their private property and did as they liked against those who went against them, together with rampant corruption. Time is running out.
There are rumblings in the throat of the nation, therefore it is imperative that action must be taken fast.
The publicity machine of the Government and Ministers must stress on what the Government has done and the strides taken, to the people at all levels, particularly at the grassroots.
The price of petrol is still lower than it was pre-2015 and has increased only because of the world price increase.
Salaries of Government servants were increased, insurance for schoolchildren, land that was forcibly taken by the Government in the North has been returned to its rightful owners.
We have now an Independent Judiciary, freedom to speak or write as we wish. People must be made aware of this in a more forthright manner.
Then there are some who didnt win their Parliamentary seats but came into Parliament on the National List, through the grace and favour of the President, also shouting themselves hoarse against the UNP, which is a partner in the coalition and raving and ranting against the Prime Minister.
If they were as honourable as they make themselves out to be, they should resign from Parliament, not sit with the Opposition.
Some of these doctors who are leading these strikes and inciting others to follow their example have been seen going in and out of the office of the former ruler leading the JO
No woman will forget the insulting remarks hurled at former President Chandrika Kumaratunga by one of them and I doubt that any woman will vote for anyone who insults a woman, whoever she is, let alone a former President, in such disgraceful, lowly manner.
Our country is beautiful, it is a pity, that there are vile people around, hungry for power and dominance who want to destroy it and its international image by their actions.
When hatred in any form is allowed to fester, violence is paramount.
The Prime Minister has played his role with great elan, despite all the slanderous attacks and fabrications hurled at him.
He is above all, a gentleman, a fount of information on any subject, be it history, music, economics or politics. He has always had integrity and courage, instilled by birth, conviction and instinct. History will Im sure record all this, in spite of the slander spread by those who are lesser mortals and who cannot reach his standards in any sphere at all.
But both he and the President must instil more discipline in members of both parties in the coalition, in public servants and speed up the process of punishing those who milked the country dry and were responsible for murders in the former regime.
It is only then that the country can be a Utopia, which is an imaginary place with a perfect social and political system.
I am confident that discipline and unity, combined with increased knowledge, a better understanding of the social forces will ensure progress, development, and permanent peace and reconciliation.

Sugar puts Tea industry in a dilemma
	
''WE WANTED TO CONDUCT THIS TEST SECRETLY"

It was last February that the story of 53 tea factories, which allegedly adulterate tea with sugar during production, was revealed. The raids on these tea factories had been carried out by the Sri Lanka Tea Board (SLTB). The Minister of Plantation Industries of Sri Lanka Navin Dissanayake said that any culprits found guilty would be punished severely. This was revealed through Sathya Gaveshana ( Exploration into the truth) an expos article which appeared in our sister newspaper ..Lankadeepa. But, the SLTB has to now check whether it adhered to the proper procedures when doing its research. When it comes to regulations relevant to the tea industry, why does the SLTB, being the legal authority, become so powerless This weeks exploration is about the much talked about story in the tea industry.
This investigation, that was done under the leadership of the former SLTB Chairman Rohan Pethiyagoda, is the first of its kind in the history of Sri Lanka tea. However, he retired from service one month after this investigation; termed as High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC). The position he vacated was filled by Lusil Wijewardena, no stranger to the tea industry. He was entrusted with the task of taking action against the allegations levelled against the 53 tea factories. But there emerged another problem because the alleged factory owners stand was that they arent guilty.
Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusion
They have taken steps to challenge the investigation, said to have been done in keeping with a pure scientific method. The minister in charge later afforded an opportunity to the factory owners to express their views. Accordingly, the minister had a discussion on March 29 with the these tea factory owners and the officers of the SLTB. As a result, these factory owners got the opportunity to express their views in writing. But the SLTB encountered an unexpected situation; they had to verify the outcome of the investigation they had already carried out. 
In the meantime Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna (JVP) parliamentarian Sunil Handunnetti made a written request to Minister Dissanayake to publish the relevant list of factory owners alleged to have adulterated the tea during manufacturing. His request was to reveal at least the names of 27 factory owners among the 80 factories who have produced tea by reasonable means. When inquired by journalists, a senior officer of the SLTB said that it was not possible to reveal the names of those concerned because no final decision had been arrived at thus far. 
However, Pethiyagoda, who was in the forefront of this investigation, is no more with the SLTB. The tea board does not seem to be interested in the relevant research methodology as well. When journalists made inquiries in this regard, Minister Dissanayake said no quick decisions could be made and it would take about three months before arriving at a conclusion. This scenario highlights a negative aspect associated with the tea board. The SLTB has a research institute as well and should be in a position to take responsibility with whatever activities it carries out. The counter allegations made by these factory owners have been aimed at distorting the truth. If this is how the SLTB takes responsibility its no shock to see that Ceylon tea has become a subject of controversy. 
When it comes to the tea industry there are many processes which are connected to it. For instance a number of activities such as tea production, export, brokerage, import and packing are involved in the tea industry. In the event of stemming a defect associated with any process, it is inevitable that the entire tea industry will be affected adversely. Given the present crisis it seems that contributions have been made by the tea plucker to the labourer to intensify the problem in the tea industry. The Tea Small Holders Association claims that it is dumped in a chaotic situation when there is a tug-of-war between the SLTB and the tea factory owners. According to them, the main reason for this competition in the market is that despite there being an increase in the number of tea factories it has not been in proportion with the production which has remained low. In reality it is the tea small holders who are in danger because they have to see to the welfare of 2 million dependents. Therefore, it is the responsibility of the authorities to take note of their grievances. 
There are various differences of opinion among the business community and the groups who are connected to this industry. These differences were highlighted in the media. However much of these differences are associated with wrong opinions, which have led to arguments. The best example for this is the tea board of neighbouring India. The Tea Board of India (TBI) acts as a facilitator to help people identify real tea from the tea that has been adulterated with colouring. In this aspect the TBI adheres to a rigid policy. Various strategies have been introduced to identify the real products. These strategies not only help the consumer to avoid buying bogus products but also assists the authorities to nab the culprits. They publish newspaper advertisements in this regard. India in comparison to Sri Lanka reveals the truth about the team thats produced in her country. India makes it a point to make it known to consumers that the future of a tea brand depends solely on honesty and trustworthiness. 
It was last year that the tea industry in Sri Lanka celebrated its 150th Anniversary. But, the negative news about the defects in the islands tea has spoiled the anniversary celebrations. Sri Lanka should not forget that it is facing a challenging situation when other players in the tea market like Kenya and India are doing well. Sri Lankan tea is bought by countries like Russia, Iraq and Iran. It is not very healthy for the SLTB to take such an irresponsible stand because there are so many dependents. It should reveal the truth about the wrong doing of the factory or otherwise accept defeat. If this isnt done it is the Ceylon Tea brand name thatll suffer because as of now the countrys tea is termed impure. This is a time when the entire tea industry must remember that old Sinhalese saying, an act of washing clothes and dipping them again in muddy waters. 
Cultivators are in trouble - Kularatna
Association of All Ceylon Tea Development Small Tea Estates Alliance Chairman K.L. Kularatna said that tea is presented to the world saying its Pure Ceylon Tea. It will damage to the reputation of tea. This is an industry which paves the way to earn the living of 2 million people. There may be only six hundred factory owners. They are engaged in unnecessary competition to earn profits. Now they have a harvest of about three to four hundred kilos from each acre.
This is not sufficient. Factories are increased while the production of tea is going down. Then the tender leaves are not sufficient to meet the capacity of the factory. Then they make various methods to increase production. Small tea owners are doing this for their living. We are in trouble due to the work of this small group. Most of the investors are local people who have invested more money on this tea industry.Tea factory owners can change this business, but we cant do it. We are experiencing a major crisis.
We wanted to conduct this test secretly 

The following are excerpts of an interview done with the former Chairman of Sri Lanka Tea Board Rohan Pethiyagoda. 
Q What sort of test was conducted by SLTB in connection with blending tea with sugar 
The issue of tea being mixed with sugar has been prevalent for sometime. I thought of a new method to verify the truth of this charge in a quick way without waiting for the processing of the black tea. Various properties of sugar are subject to several chemical changes during heating. Any difference detected in the tea leaves during the process of drying, after grinding, proves that the tea has been mixed with sugar. But some were of the view that this test could be done only with black tea and it didnt surface in the mind of anyone that this test could be easily done at the factory premises. When tea leaves are put in water before they are put in the oven at the factory, the tea begins to dilute and will taste sweet, if sugar has been added. This is a simple and easy method of testing whether there is sugar in tea. 
Q But the alleged factory owners maintain that sugar, to a certain degree, is an inherent property of tea itself. How do you explain this view 
Its true that sugar is naturally found in tea leaves and also in other kinds of leaves. But this sugar is present in fructose form and includes glucose and sucrose. This is less than one percent of the sugar which is produced by the leaf itself. However there is no possibility of increasing this minute degree of sugar during the drying and grinding stages. 
We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them - Rohan Pethiyagoda
Q There is another allegation that this test has been conducted without the direct involvement of SLTB.Your comments. 
We wanted to conduct this test secretly. We didnt even use the SLTBs vehicles as drivers would come to know about our task. This would have made the factory staff take every precaution to stop their misconducts. I made arrangements to bring the relevant officers to the auditorium of the Tea Research Institute in Kottawa, Galle by inviting them to a so-called farewell party on my retirement from the SLTB. 
We deployed them in groups of two according to the list of factories. Instructions were given to take samples and transport them in cabs while keeping the mobile phones off. What was happening was not known to them. 
If they had known about our purpose their abuses in the processing of tea would not have been detected. 
Q Why is sugar added in the processing of tea 
Ferrous sulfate, potassium permanganate, sodium hydroxide and sugar are added to give a black colour to the tea. Black tea is expensive and Arabian countries prefer this type of tea. Normally processed tea is grayish in colour. The other thing is that sugar helps in the process of fine grinding. The third factor is the weight. A kilo of sugar costs only Rs.100 while a kilo of tea is Rs 600-700. 
Q Some accept that they mix sugar with tea and also argue that there is no harm in this blending process. 
A scientist at the Tea Research Institute (TRI) in 1971 prescribed as acceptable a small amount of sugar to be mixed with the tea. This was included in a research paper. However some factory owners have taken it as a recommendation of the TRI. There are easy and profitable ways of manufacturing tea. But it should comply with the legal requirements.We assure the quality of our tea when dealing with the international market. If the real sate of our tea is revealed it will badly affect the produce from Sri Lanka. Other main exporters like India and Kenya follow strict procedures in the operating of their tea industries. 
The mixed tea tends to develop a certain fungus three months after the tea auctions and becomes unsalable. These factory owners should realise that they are causing a bad global impression when they do this to our tea. 
Q TRI is preparing to do a review of this particular test. Do you agree to such a review 
For our tests we brought down samples of withered tea leaves and leaves of the later stages to Colombo. These samples were brought by the tea inspectors employed under the Commissioner of Tea. They were sealed and signed samples and were also given to the factory owners to avoid any possible disputes.Therefore the allegation of blending tea in Colombo is not true. There was transparency when these tests were done. If there is any suspicion a sample could be retested.
Private Tea Factory Owners Association behind issue 
Following are excerpts of an interview done with a factory owner who is shrouded in allegations.
Q What happened really 
That is the general methodology used by SLTB. We are harassed first and then slapped with a fine of Rs.50,000 or 100,000. The factory owners pay the fine because they cant bear the oppression. The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. Even the officers of the SLTB arent aware of this methodology. Opinion is divided within the SLTB itself. 
Q But, hasnt it been proved that tea is adulterated with sugar 
The sugar level in the tea may fluctuate due to the climate, fertilizer and manner in which tea leaves are plucked. It is practically difficult to prepare a baseline. On the other hand, the chemical composition in tea differs from the places where the leaves are plucked. Tea leaves are put into the dryer after 2 hours of withering and rolling. No recent study has been done in this regard. The SLTB proved that the glucose content is more in the rolled leaf than in the withered one. These claims arent scientific because the carbohydrate content increases as soon as the leaf is put in the roller. The HPLC methodology is only a reading. 
The SLTB should get involved in this and find out whats happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka - A factory owner
Q More or less, sugar in the tea may appear as fructose and glucose whereas there may be a slight presence of sucrose. Do you support the argument that there is no reason to increase the natural sugar content while drying and grinding tea leaf 
That is wrong. There is ample evidence of research to prove it. This person who is making this claim has no knowledge about botany. If that is so, this person should do a research and prove it. Really, the former chairman wanted to show that he is a big shot. 
Q Do you accept the suggestion that the sealed tea sample test can dispel doubts 
That is useless. For instance the average value of blood samples should be known to see whether there is dengue. Comparisons are done like that. Here, there is no average value to be compared. What are here are his dimensions. That is not a definition. 
Q Are there people who adulterate tea with sugar 
Yes. We have to find out why do they do so The quality of the Sri Lanka tea is gradually declining. The SLTB should get involved in this and find out whats happening. There is a big problem of labour in Sri Lanka. The people in the past plucked tea leaf every five days. Later these figures changed from seven to ten days. If mature leaf is adulterated with sugar then it will become wet. When we get 25 kgs. of plucked tea leaves by paying 6 dollars, the countries like Kenya pay 1 dollar and get 60 kgs of plucked leaves. It is useless boasting about Ceylon Tea without having a means to survive.
The SLTB is an institution where bureaucracy reigns supreme. The main question is whether they have done this to stop the malpractices in the tea industry or whether their aim is to be in the good books of the Minister. - A factory owner
Q Do you say that there is no problem in mixing tea with sugar 
Really, there is no problem. Even though sugar is mixed, it will not remain as we boil the tea in a high temperature. For instance, this is not an act similar to mixing brick dust with chili powder. On the other hand, all types of chemicals are sprayed in the growing process until the tea leaves are brought to the factory after plucking. If there is nothing like that there is no need for the tea board to intervene. It is the Brahman caste or the Private Tea Factory Owners Association which is behind this. In the chairmans factory, 15,000 kgs of tea is not produced per month. Their factories are closing down on a daily basis. They who are unable to face the competition and are trying to close the biggest factories in Sri Lanka. 
Q What did you demand from Prime Minister 
To start a scholarly discussion including the tea board and factory owners. We also asked to conduct a research with the Tea Research Institute. Now there are bogus tea plants all over Sri Lanka. The Tea Board must be committed to start genuine tea nurseries. But, they do not address these real problems.
It is baseless to make allegations - Ranasinghe
Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association Chairman Harith Ranasinghe said that if sugar is mixed with tea, the weight and color change resulting in extra profits. Then they can overcome others. Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association is not going behind anyone. The Minister was informed in one voice by the Sri Lanka Tea Factory Owners Association to inquire into this as it is a disgrace to the name of Sri Lanka Tea, if such a things are happening, he said.
Methodology needs to be examined - Edirisinghe
Tea Commissioner E.A.J.K Edirisinghe said that all 53 factories have already submitted reports on the production process of their factories. They are now being studied by the Tea Board. Their main concern is about the methodology applied by the Tea Board in the testing process. Therefore we are now reviewing our testing methodology.

## Title: The two-lane New York of Sri Lanka

The two-lane New York of Sri Lanka
	
If you could take a subway from the suburbs in Boston, where I live, to downtown in 10 minutes, that improves your life over sitting in a traffic jam
- Noam Chomsky
What the skyline of Buthgamuwa road offers to viewers these days is only second to Colombo 1 in terms of the number of high rising buildings. This otherwise laid back largely neglected neighbourhood of Kotte no doubt is fast becoming the New York of Sri Lanka with the mushrooming of apartment complexes along the meandering Diyawanna lake.
 
The government decision to release Buthgamuwa land to real estate companies has seen an unlimited number of construction related vehicles including containers and cement mixing machines running down the narrow two lane road of Buthgamuwa. The traffic flow is often stopped by the workers whenever these huge vehicles carrying construction hardware enter the sites. The latest to add to the number of sites is a Sri Lanka-China joint venture with 242 apartments which has already given the area a mini-Beijing look with the high Chinese presence. 
This unfolding phenomenon has seen the land value of the otherwise run down Buthgamuwa reaching dizzy heights. However, it looks as if the authorities have overlooked one of the most critical factors in development  roads, when releasing the land to real estate companies thus introducing an unexpected influx of population to the area. 
The two-lane Buthgamuwa road, which has only one track for Colombo-bound traffic, reports the worst traffic snarls in Colombo suburbs as of now. Some days it takes nearly 30 minutes to travel even the last leg of two km before it joins Colombo-bound Kotte traffic. The Rajagiriya flyover no doubt has benefited the Kotte residents. However what the authorities have overlooked was that with the opening of the flyover, the number of entry points to Kotte road for the Colombo-bound Buthgamuwa motorists have been reduced to one. Until then they enjoyed two entry points - one next to the filling station at Rajagiriya and the other from Buthgamuwa crossroad at the HSBC Junction in Kotte. Both these have now been scrapped and the only entry point the Colombo-bound motorist has today is the one underthe flyover. 
No doubt the present traffic system at Rajagiriya Junction is methodical however, it has been created at the cost of the peace of mind and traffic time of the Buthgamuwa motorist. The reduction of entry points has come at a time when the completed apartment complexes are being released to the use of buyers and more high-rise buildings under construction. 
Widening of the road giving at least two lanes for the Colombo-bound traffic appears to be a solution. However another and perhaps the more logical option could be to link Perera Mawatha near the bridge to Rajagiriya at a point passing theflyover junction. 
In fact constructing a road linking Buthgamuwa and Cotta Road would have been a better logical idea than the Peliyagoda-Rajagiriya phase of the new flyover that the government is currently working on. After all Buthgamuwa Road is taken by motorists from Kohilawatte, Kotikawatte, Gothatuwa (IDH), Kalapaluwawa, Himbutana and Angoda all densely populated areas with tens of thousands of vehicles already plying down the roads and thousands more to join with the completion of the rest of the apartment complexes. 
However, the best solution for traffic snarls in Colombo suburbs, not only for Buthgamuwa but for all other areas, would be a sophisticated rail system covering all the suburban areas of Colombo city so that as in Japan the middle class would swap their cars for trains. These should be connected with shuttle bus services to office areas. 
Till this becomes a reality, the government should offer an interim solution to Buthgamuwa motorists without delay.

They have only gone hush-hush
	

The Green backbenchers who quite boldly and openly campaigned for radical party reforms in the recent past suddenly went into the silent mode. However, they have not given up the struggle and are planning hush hush their way forward, they say.

The reformists have become cautious in discussing their plans after finding several moles posing as hawks among them, regularly posting the leadership on their new plans. Now that they have identified the moles, they have embarked on a secret plan to uncover more possible ones of their kind for a full cleansing, they say.

Tug-o-war over their political future
	

A few politicos of the Group of 16 that crossed over to the opposition recently are said to be embroiled in a polemical row.

The groups majority reportedly holds the view that they should team up with the JO instead of keeping one leg in the government and other in the opposition.
However, two gabby ones, one from the central hills and the other from Uva are adamant that they should continue to hold on to the Blue identity despite being in the opposition and one or two others including an offspring of a governing one are standing by
the duo.
Meanwhile, some of them have taken exception to the statement made by John the Silent from the Gem City about the next party leader.
Notwithstanding the ongoing row, the loyalists of the former strongman within the group who are keen on teaming up with the Pohottuwa may have the last laugh, they say.

UNP gained strength  from President Premadasas Housing Concept
	
Western Provincial Council member Jayantha de Silva said the UNP gained strength for its victory from President Ranasinghe Premadasas housing concept. 
Addressing a ceremony to hand over deeds to the owners of Serpentine Road Housing Scheme in Borella, he said electing politicians do not serve any purpose unless they understood the burning issues affecting the people. He pointed out that the politicians must speak in a language that appealed to the people and mettheir aspirations. 
We, as politicians, must always listen to the people and look into their needs and do what they expect. The Buddha gave up austerities and followed the middle path to attain Buddhahood. This has set an example and provided a guideline to all of us. However, it is sad that many among us do not understand it.
Parents produced forged deeds and documents to get their children admitted to popular schools. Now they have received deeds for their houses and they must not resort to any malpractice as they did before. Usually a house is needed as dowry for a young woman to be given in marriage, the parents have now been relieved of that burden by receiving their deeds which confirms their ownership of the house, We must be grateful to Minister Sajith Premadasa for these revolutionary moves 
We would continually remain in power. We have visionary leaders. There is no match for the UNP that has rendered an unparalleled service to the country from its very inception. Gigantic development projects including Gal-oya scheme, Mahaweli, Victoria, Randenigala and Kotmale projects stand to the credit of the UNP. Former Minister of Higher Education Lalith Athulathmudali initiated vast fields for education and implemented the Mahapola Scholarship scheme to help the universities and other educational institutes. 
President Ranasinghe Premadasas housing programme brought victory to the UNP and enabled it to form a government. The people need employment, housing, schools, common amenities and infrastructure facilities. It is the duty of the ministers to contribute to the development effort with dedication. Many supporters are not happy with us today. They unleash scathing attack on us and I have a fair share of it. One must feed his/her children and not those of others to have a happier, fuller and a pleasanter home.
My policy is to develop my area within my capacity. I am not in a position to implement massive programmes for want of funds. I am happy that my organizers in the Grama Niladhari divisions are fulfilling their task well. Majority of the people in my area received deeds and loans. This has strengthened the party. It is the duty of all of us to join hands and lead the UNP to victory PC Member de Silva added.
Senior officials of the Housing Development Authority and members of the Borella UNP organising committee were present at the occasion.

Viral disease in South under control: Dr. Jasinghe
	
While stating that the prevailing viral disease in the Southern Province had been under control, Director General of Health Services Dr. Anil Jasinghe said the people should be vigilant of any feverish symptoms like cold, cough and fever to seek medical aid.
Addressing a news conference, he said this disease situation had arisen due to influenza viruses and there was nothing to be perplexed.
This disease situation has prevailed during this period in earlier also. But what is incompatible here is that most of the infants, less than one year are susceptible to the prevailing epidemic. What we request the general public is that, if any of the said symptoms like cold, cough and fever can be seen in children; take them to a qualified physician and take precautions as prescribed by the physician, Dr. Jasinghe said.
He further said seven deaths have been reported so far due to the prevailing epidemic situation and 500-600 patients of this epidemic and other viral diseases have been reported from the South.
The patients are taking treatment in the Kamburupitiya Base hospital, Karapitiya Teaching Hospital and District General Hospital, Matara. We have provided with every facility needed for the patients. We have also taken steps to prevent the disease from spreading by providing the staff of the hospitals with masks, Jasinghe added. (Sheain Fernandopulle)

Waiting for the right time
	

When a large majority of Pohottuwa is for putting forward the military sibling, the onetime power behind the throne, as their candidate at the coming big poll, some party bigwigs continue to mention other names in this connection causing confusion among the rank and file, they say.

While some high-ups mention the name of the scion of Boralugoda some others announce the name of the former Diyawanna chair as the party candidate, they say.
However, the former strongman with an unrivalled political savvy is observing a studied silence over the matter. He is expected to announce the real candidate at an auspicious time in another few months, they say.

Zuckerberg to address EU lawmakers over data scandal
	

DPA, 22nd MAY, 2018-Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg is due to meet EU lawmakers on Tuesday regarding the global data scandal involving the social media platform.
The meeting comes as Facebook admitted last month that it had improperly shared the personal data of 87 million users with British data firm Cambridge Analytica. Up to 2.7 million of those users are from EU countries.
Zuckerberg is expected to apologize to EU lawmakers for Facebooks failures that allowed the misuse of personal data and political manipulation during the 2016 US presidential elections and the British referendum over EU membership, The New York Times reported.
Whether its fake news, foreign interference in elections or developers misusing peoples information, we didnt take a broad enough view of our responsibilities, Zuckerberg is expected to say, according to prepared remarks seen by paper.
The European Parliaments president confirmed on Monday via Twitter that the hearing will now be streamed live online following complaints that it was originally planned to be behind closed doors.
I have personally discussed with Facebook CEO Mr Zuckerberg the possibility of webstreaming [the] meeting with him, Antonio Tajani tweeted. I am glad to announce that he has accepted this new request. Great news for EU citizens.
The parliament had come under fire after it was announced initially that the meeting would be held privately and attended by select members of parliament.
