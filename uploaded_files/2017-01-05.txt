The chairpersons of the two lotteries boards said they had appointed some new agents and would appoint some more within this month.

## Title: Are biofilms silent killers  in hospitals?

Are biofilms silent killers  in hospitals?
	
?
It?s easy to appreciate the need to disinfect germs on surfaces, but have you ever wondered how germs exist on surfaces in the first place? Enter the biofilm. In recent years, scientists have increased their understanding of these dense colonies of bacteria that produce an extracellular material that binds a community of different microorganisms together and anchors them to both living and?inanimate surfaces. ??
?Biofilms are traditionally associated with wet or damp surfaces. They form on the surface of catheter lines, pacemakers, heart valve replacements, artificial joints, other surgical implants and in hospital showers. However, biofilms have also been discovered recently on dry hospital surfaces. Bacteria growing in a biofilm are highly resistant to antibiotics, up to 1,000 times more resistant than the same bacteria not growing in a biofilm. Standard antibiotic therapy is often useless and the only recourse may be to remove the contaminated implant which will cause a lot of suffering to the patient. ?
?Biofilms are involved in numerous diseases. For instance, cystic fibrosispatients have Pseudomonas infections that often result in antibiotic resistant biofilms. Fungal biofilms cause chronic vaginal infections and lead to life-threatening systemic infections in people with weak immune systems. ? ?So what should we do about biofilms on hospital surfaces? It seems that a daily light cleaning with existing products will do little more than feed and water these biofilms. The world also needs to wake up to the fact that biofilms are present on dry hospital surfaces and that this is a problem we need to address. ??
One reason for the failure of eradication measures is that historically, we have not developed hospital decontamination protocols with biofilms in mind. Therefore, biofilms should also be considered when developing future hospital decontamination protocols. ? Defining hospital areas according to the risk of infection is another effective method. Areas where contamination is expected such as laboratories, operating theatres and labour rooms must be cleaned and disinfected frequently. Areas of low risk, such as administration and waiting rooms, only require a daily cleaning. ??
The CDC (Centres for Disease Control and Prevention in USA) estimate that over 65% of hospital-acquired infections are caused by biofilms. The world should pay more attention to bioflms in hospitals and create a safe and healthy environment for patients?to be treated.

Assets Case: Court wants medical report on Duminda
	
Colombo Additional Magistrate Aruni Artygalle today directed the prison authorities to submit a medical report on Duminda Silva within two weeks.
He is facing charges of not having declared his assets and liabilities for three years.
The suspect was brought to Court in an ambulance and but not produced before the Magistrate after his counsel told Court that his client was unable leave the ambulance because he was critically ill.
After confirming that the suspect was in the Court premises, the Magistrate put off the three cases filed against him to January 26.
The Bribery Commission filed three separate cases against Mr. Silva under the Assets and Liabilities Act for not having declared his assets in 2010, 2011 and 2013.

Hacking of Health Ministry website: Experts launch probe
	
A comprehensive technical investigation is being carried out by the National Centre for Cyber Security into the hacking of the website of the Ministry of Healthcare, Nutrition and Indigenous Medicine on Tuesday night.
A senior official of the Sri Lanka CERT-CC (Computer Emergency Readiness Team ? Coordinating Centre) told Daily Mirror that they were working on the problem after receiving the initial data from the Ministry.
He said there were at least four ways in which the website could have been hacked due to shortcomings in the way the website was maintained.
If the operating system of the server of a website is poor or has lapses a hacker could get into the system.
If there are weaknesses in the design of the website, a hacker to break into the site. Finally if there are shortcomings in the tools or software used to create the website, it could be hacked.
Misplacing a password or a breach of security by a person or group updating the website could give an opportunity for someone to hack the site, he said.
The specialists are investigating the manner in which the breach had been made and they may arrive at the solution today.
The expert said anyone with access to the Internet within or outside the country could be the culprit. He said it could be the handiwork of a local genius or of the foreign group called the Muslim Cyber Army (MCA) which was supposed to be responsible according to the claim on the site,
He said ministry officials have given orders to keep the website offline until the fault was corrected.
The hackers claimed to be from the MCA, an Indonesian extremist group, on the website to which searchers were directed. They used an Arabic phrase placed below an armed jihadist style logo which gave the phrase's English translation as: Noble Life or Martyrdom.
The experts have not yet discovered whether the hacking was by the MCA as claimed, or by a local who wanted to mislead the investigators. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

I won't topple Govt. while RW is away: MR
	
Former president, Mahinda Rajapaksa MP, said yesterday that he was not a backstabber and would only topple the government when Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe was in the country and not when he was abroad.
In response to the prime minister?s remark that Mr. Rajapaksa could do whatever he wanted to after he left for Switzerland on January 17, the former president said Mr. Wickremesinghe had nothing to fear from him.
?I assure the prime minister that I won?t topple the government while he is away. Backstabbing is not in my nature. Everything will be done in a democratic manner when he is in the country. There is nothing for him to be afraid of. He can leave for Switzerland and come back safely,? Mr. Rajapaksa told the journalists at his political office in Battaramulla.
He said the year 2017 would be a crucial one and that privatisation of state enterprises, division of the country, economic failure and political witchhunts would continue in the new year as well.
?We had the ability to pay back loans but this government has lost that. We increased the value of the country and in fact I added an extra block of land to the country. Today, the president continues to declare open development projects initiated by us, and the premier continues to sell them,? he said.
Commenting on the development projects in Hambantota, Mr. Rajapaksa said the port and the airport were long term investments which had added great value to the area and to the country.
Meanwhile, referring to the laying of a foundation stone for a vehicle assembly plant in Kuliyapitiya, he said it was uncertain whether the factory was really a Volkswagen factory.
?It seems this factory will not produce -- but only assemble -- some cars of inferior quality and sell those to us. Don?t think it will be able to export any. We already have several vehicle assembly plants in the country,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Aminister and an MP in India have ? suggested that it?s the way women dress that?s to blame for the mass ?sex attack in Bangalore on New Year?s Eve. ??
In the city of Bangalore, ?the largest in the southern Indian state of Karnataka, scores of women ?were, according to the local media, attacked and molested by groups of ?men.
The sexual ?assaults happened despite the presence of 1,500 police on the streets. ?The incident has spread shock throughout the country.
Referring to the reports, Karnataka Home Minister, G Parameshwara criticized women for dressing ?like westerners.??
The minister was condemned for the ?irresponsible? remark by the central government?s junior home minister Kiren Rijiju, according to AFP.
Parameshwara later claimed he was misquoted. Abu Azmi, president of the Samajwadi Party?s Maharashtra state branch, was even more blunt in laying the blame on women.
?In ?these modern times, the more women are naked, the more fashionable, ?modern and educated they are considered. And this is increasing in the ?country. This is a blot on our culture,? NDTV quoted him as saying.?
Azmi has been known for making similarly controversial remarks over the ?years. In 2014, he called for women who have sex outside marriage to ?face the death penalty.
Sex crimes are a widespread problem in India. The National Crime Record ?Bureau said over 34,000 cases of rape were reported throughout 2015, or ?around one rape every 15 minutes.

The Kuliyapitiya assembly plant will assemble European brands of vehicles, Minister and UNP Deputy General Secretary Akila Viraj Kariyawasam said today.
The Minister told a media briefing that the factory would have to be constructed and has to become operational within two years. If not he said the land would go back to the government.
?The project is to assemble European vehicles and one would able to witness the truth once the plant becomes operational,? he said responding to a question raised by journalists as to whether it will actually assemble Volkswagen vehicles.
He added that the project would come back to life step by step. Accordingly around 200 vehicles would be assembled initially and expanded further.
Minister Kariyawasam who elaborated on the Hambantota Port issue said the private-public partnership would be the best option given the debt situation in which Sri Lanka is in at the moment, so that the people will not have to bear the burden in such a situation.
?More than 95 per cent of lands that would be allocated for the Hambantota industrial zone are state owned ones while there are a few that are privately owned. The Rajapaksas are worried that they would lose their stronghold if Hambantota is developed in the future and this is the reason why they are going against the setting up of the industrial zone in the area,? he added.

Pipeline to Kolonnawa oil Terminal to go ahead
	
The Petroleum Resources Development Ministry will lay a Cross Country Pipeline from Colombo Port to Kolonnawa Oil Terminal on a Government to Government agreement and 100% financing on EPC (Engineering Procurement and Construction) turnkey basis either with the US, China, India or Malaysia at a cost of Rs. 17 billion, the Daily Mirror learns.
Petroleum Resources Development Minister Chandima Weerakkody has got the Cabinet approval to go ahead with the project and select a suitable investor from one of the above countries.
Minister Weerakkody has been authorised by the Cabinet to appoint a skeleton staff in the Ceylon Petroleum Storage Terminals Ltd, (CPSTL) including local or foreign consultant if necessary for the project and also to authorise Secretary to the Ministry of Finance to grant a tax waiver for importation of necessary materials, equipment, machinery and services. The Secretary to the Ministry of Finance will provide a Sovereign Guarantee for the full loan amount to meet 100% of the project cost, in favour of the Ceylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) under an on lending agreement between CPC and CPSTL, for the selected contractor.
The most favourable procurement method was advised to be selected by the CAPC with the assistance of TEC (Technical Evaluation Committee) to implement this project in a transparent, efficient and economical manner after preparing total cost estimate having determined the overall scope relating to the project in consultation with the Ministry of Finance. The TEC will recommend a suitable procurement method to be adopted, among International open Competitive Bidding (ICB), Limited Competitive Bidding (LCB) and Government to Government (G-G) procurement methods, Minister Weerakkody said.
Minister Weerakkody has informed the Cabinet that four proposals from the US, China, India and Malaysia had already been received and CAPC is of the view that RFPs should be called only from those four countries and to receive only one each comprehensive proposal recommended by the respective Embassy / High Commission for the scope approved by the Board of Directors of CPSTL in 2015.
CPSTL has already designed 75% of the pipeline up to the tunnel gate of Colombo Port from Kolonnawa Terminal and off-shore segment and loading arms at Dolphin Pier need to be designed.
In the meantime, CPSTL has continued with the refurbishment project of existing pipeline and is now ready to undertake the segment at Orugodawatta railway crossing.
As most of material and services of this project need to be imported, a considerable tax component will be added on the total project cost, which will increase the project cost. Considering this as an urgent, national project, a tax waiver is proposed for materials and services that may have to be imported and also the ICPSTL to undertake urgently the refurbishment of the pipeline using its own funds and resources.

Purchase of new fighter aircraft: SLAF still to finalize fleet requirements
	
The Sri Lanka Air Force (SLAF) is still in the process of finalizing its fleet requirements to purchase new multi-role combat aircraft to replace MiG and Kfir fleet.
Earlier, the government had announced that it intends to purchase eight to 12 new multi-role combat aircraft for the SLAF.
President Maithripala Sirisena and the Cabinet have officially granted the Ministry of Defence permission to solicit offers from foreign aircraft manufacturers for the procurement of new aircraft and associated weapon systems on a government-to-government basis.
SLAF Spokesman Group Captain Gihan Seneviratne said once the fleet requirements were finalized, they would call for bids from countries to purchase aircraft most likely within this year.
?Contemporary aircraft which would be suitable for the coming years would be purchased,? he said.
The SLAF presently has a fleet of Israeli Kfirs and Russian-made MiG-27s and India is also eager to add its own make to the arsenals. Seven Chengdu F-7 (license-built MIG-21), nine Harbin Y-12 turboprop military transport, plus one Chengdu F-7 and five Hongdu JL-8 jet trainers operates at the air force.
Earlier, Cabinet Spokesman and Parliamentary Reforms and Media Minister Gayantha Karunathilaka said that only one Kfir aircraft is operational and six others cannot be used.
He said SLAF have seven MiGs and eight others but none of them can be used.
It was reported that SLAF is looking at JF-17 Thunder at least four million dollars per jet as a replacement for its Kfirs and MiG-27s.
The SLAF?s fighter fleet currently consists of one single Israel Aerospace Industries (IAI) Kfir multi-role combat aircraft. While the Kfir uses the same airframe as the French-made Dassault Mirage 5, it is equipped with Israeli avionics and an Israeli-built variant of the General Electric J79 turbojet engine. From 1995 to 2005, Sri Lanka acquired a total of 16 Kfir fighter jets from Israel. At least seven aircraft were lost due to accidents or ground attacks on airbases during the Civil War.

Ravi calls CB Governor a hospital attendant
	
If Central Bank Governor Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy has said the economy is clearly in the hospital today, it was in the ICU during the Mahinda Rajapaksa Government and governor Coomaraswamy was an attendant to it, Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake today said.
Addressing a news conference held at the Ministry, the minister said he believed that Dr. Coomaraswamy hadn?t made such a comment but said if he had done so, Dr. Coomaraswamy should understand that he had played the role of a hospital attendant when the economy was in the ICU.
?I?m surprised that the governor has made a comment like that. Maybe the media has misinterpreted or distorted what he said. As the finance minister, it?s my responsibility to correct wrong reports,? he said.
He said the government?s monetary and fiscal policies were clear and the government was making measures to salvage the economy and to bring it to the Out Patients Department (OPD) of the hospital.
Delivering a speech on ?Monetary and Financial Sector Policies for 2017 and Beyond? Dr. Indrajit Coomaraswamy on Tuesday has said Sri Lanka was the only country, other than Afghanistan, in the Asia-Pacific region with an IMF programme and having an IMF programme is the economic equivalent to being in hospital.
?We are not in the ICU but clearly in hospital. The remedial treatment is known and it is encouraging that it has commenced,? he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla and Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Upul Tharanga (12), Angelo Mathews (49), Suranga Lakmal (10), Lahiru Kumara (9) and Nuwan Pradeep (5) followed suit as Rabada ended the match with bowling figures of 6-55 from 17 overs in the second innings.
Overall, the 21-year-old took 10 wickets, which put him behind Vernon Philander as only the second South African player to nab two 10-wicket hauls.
The third and final test starts at the Wanderers next Thursday.

Say ?yes? to good Oral health!
	
?Oral health can be defined as the proper maintenance and hygiene of the mouth, including the teeth, tongue, oral mucus membrane, palate and the lips? says General Secretary of the Sri Lanka Dental Association and Regional Dental Surgeon of the Colombo District, Dr. Vipula Wickramasinghe. Stating that oral hygiene basically means a disease-free mouth,?
Dr. Wickramasinghe explained the significance of maintaining good oral health from early childhood and preventing the formation of dental caries, gum disease and tooth decay from taking root?in the oral cavity.
?
Importance and benefits of maintaining good oral health?
The mouth has several functions. The teeth and bones provide a good facial profile, given that you have a proper set of teeth and facial bones barring birth defects. A good facial profile thus enables one to have a good personality and helps enhance one?s self-confidence. ?Maintaining good oral health is important in ensuring that your mouth is active because activity itself helps strengthen the facial muscles of an individual. For instance, an individual having fewer teeth may be prone to developing wrinkles in the long run. On the contrary, a proper set of teeth help maintain a proper muscle tone for the improvement of one?s facial profile including healthy facial growth; especially in children. A self-cleaning process of the mouth is also facilitated through the functions of the salivary glands when oral hygiene is well maintained. The tongue plays an equally important function and has taste buds that help identify taste; thus they must be cleaned properly daily. On the other hand, the entire digestive process commences with the oral cavity. Certain enzymes secreted from the mouth accompanied with proper chewing will help enhance the digestion of food. Additionally, a good set of teeth plays a crucial role in one?s ability to pronounce words properly. These are some important advantages of maintaining good oral health? Dr. Wickramasinghe added. ??
In order to achieve these benefits, it is vital that we inculcate and maintain good oral habits. Stating that the oral health of a mother is very important, Dr. Wickramasinghe said that this applies even during pregnancy. If good oral hygiene is not practiced during pregnancy, it could imply that the mother is a carrier of harmful bacteria in her mouth.?
?Since the mother is the first to kiss and feed the baby, there is a high potential for the direct transmission of harmful bacteria from mother to child if the mother doesn?t maintain good oral hygiene. Bacteria can accumulate inside the baby?s mouth and can lead to diseases once the teeth start emerging. Therefore, proper oral hygiene during pregnancy is mandatory for expectant mothers. ??
During the first trimester of pregnancy, most mothers experience morning sickness. Thus, in order to counteract the acidities that could be present in the mouth and to maintain the hygiene of the mouth, it is pivotal to brush one?s teeth and clean their tongue in the aftermath of morning sickness. Since mothers consume a lot of intermittent food as part of their cravings during pregnancy, the chances of food particles accumulating in the mouth are higher than under usual circumstances. Brushing teeth after the intake of intermittent food is thus essential. Throughout the pregnancy there will be many hormonal changes including pregnancy diabetes. Such conditions could give rise to side-effects such as gum problems. Researchers point to a scientific relationship between gum disease and low birth rates in babies. Therefore, a mother has to take adequate measures during the pregnancy period with regard to her well-being in order to deliver a healthy baby? he said. ??
?
How to maintain good oral health and prevent tooth decay
Following the first six months after the birth of an infant, one can observe the lower teeth emerging in a baby?s mouth. Therefore, from the start, it is important that a baby?s teeth are cleaned properly. When the number of teeth increases by three or four, a toothbrush with soft filament must be used to clean the teeth of a baby, Dr. Wickramasinghe advised. ?
Highlighting that a mother?s milk would not result in tooth decay in a child?s mouth, he said that when a child was introduced to powdered/ artificial milk, it was always advisable to use a minimum level of sugar for the preparation of milk in order to prevent tooth decay. Adding that it is not advisable to bottle feed milk during the night, Dr. Wickramasinghe said any solidified milk particles present in the milk could be deposited in the teeth, giving rise to tooth decay. This is commonly known as ?Feeding Bottle Syndrome? where tooth decay occurs as a result of using a feeding bottle; since solidified particles get deposited in the teeth, whereas only the liquid filters into the mouth through the teeth. ??
Since the first permanent teeth appear around the age of six years leading to a set of 28 teeth by the age of approximately thirteen, it is important that children be trained to take proper care of their teeth from a very early age. By the age of 18-21, young adults will have 32 teeth in their mouth, although in some cases delays could occur depending on individual growth spurts. Since new teeth could contain a lot of grooves, they should be brushed properly to prevent the formation of cavities. ?
?
Giving a few tips on how to maintain good oral health, Dr. Wickramasinghe said it was advisable to discourage children from becoming addicted to sweets and instead encouraging them to consume more fruits and vegetables. While brushing teeth at least twice a day with a fluoridated toothpaste is vital in preventing the accumulation of bacteria in the mouth, it is always recommended to brush teeth after consuming the main meals of the day. Starting from the age of five-six and after, it is always advisable to visit dentists for a dental checkup every six months. Proper chewing of food is also equally important, as it helps the digestive process in addition to help toning the facial muscles. He also advised that carbonated drinks/fizzy drinks containing sugar should be avoided as much as possible since they could erode teeth by damaging the enamel layer in the inner part of teeth, leading to cavities and sensitivities. In the event of any discolouration of the teeth or if you notice blood while brushing the teeth, it is advisable to seek immediate medical attention.

Stones in  the urethra and bladder: ayurveda has a cure
	
?The presence of stones in the urethra and gall bladder is a common health problem in society today along with non-communicable diseases. ??
In Western medicine, operations are the main method used for their removal. However, there is a possibility of them resurfacing even after surgery. ??
With the application of two methods under the Ayurveda system on the other hand, these stones can be removed. Permanent cures exist under the Ayurveda system and use medicinal drugs to dissolve them. Depending on how acute the condition is, it is necessary to provide medicine that will split the stones into smaller particles and cause them to be expelled with urine. Medication should be provided to dissolve stones that are 5mm or less and to prevent the creation of such stones.Through the use of these Ayurvedic drugs, even hard stones could be split into smaller fragments and passed out.
The possibility of the problem reappearing is also very remote. The patient should observe the instructions on the medicine strictly and avoid oily and starchy foods. Exercise is also important. ??
Unclean and pesticide contaminated water should be avoided. It is advisable to consume radish, kekiri sarana green leaves, cucumber and kohila. Neeramulliya and nelli drinks are also beneficial. ??
A patient is sure to recover within two months after the use of this medicine. While the patient is on the medication, scanning should be done regularly. A permanent cure is guaranteed through?

The legal gambling of hope
	
Lottery ticket agents and salesmen who flocked in front of the Colombo Fort Railway Station on Tuesday were of the opinion that the price hike was unfair, and that it would eventually discourage customers from buying lotteries. On the contrary, many others believed that the price hike was fair as long as the commission they received from the sales also increases. ??
However, trusted sources revealed that there were approximately 300,000 street lottery sellers in Sri Lanka. According to what we gathered from the protestors at Fort, this figure included a number of disabled persons whose sole income was from the sale of lottery tickets. Undoubtedly, their courage and will to survive have to be feted and felicitated. But we questioned the perfectly-able individuals who also included a significant number of young able bodied men, as to why they chose the sale of lottery as their means of living. ?
?
?Lottery sales, a daunting task?
- Priyantha Obadarachchi, lottery salesman from Hambantota
?The minister has spoken as if a lottery ticket agent could be recruited overnight. This is not a job that could be done with a training of few days. The tickets we sell may be only Rs. 20, but the commitment we take is worth much more. We spend days in a small cubicle space, sun or rain, taking great care of our cash, maintaining our accounts and then convincing people to try their luck. We are only demanding a fair recognition for our toil.? ?
?
?
History of the Lottery
Initially, the lottery was set up in Sri Lanka by the government to finance the impoverished health services sector. Accordingly, the Hospital Lotteries Board was established in 1955 according to a proposal by the then Local Government Minister. In 1960s, the government felt the need to widen the scope of activities of organised lottery as the country was in a dire need of funds for development. Hence, the Hospital Lotteries Board was abolished and the NLB set up in 1963. A Benz car was on offer in its first draw the Jathika Lottery in 1965. ??
Many years lapsed, lotteries were renamed and televised and daily draws were introduced, signalling the beginning of an obsessive practice for the most hopeful of hopefuls. It has been 46 years since the introduction of the NLB?s Mahajana Sampatha, the country?s most popular lottery ticket. NLB boasts that 16.5% of the turnover is contributed to the Consolidated Fund through this ticket. What does this mean for an island nation obsessed about the idea of winning the jackpot? ??
?
?Sale of dreams, set alight by aspirations?
? Prof. Daya Amarasekara, Peradeniya University Sociology Dept.?
??Impoverished people are in a constant chase of dreams and aspirations. When they feel defeated, a lottery offers them renewed hope. They are in a constant chase of finances, this pursuit comes to a point where individuals are compelled to earn more and more through whatever means they see possible. A lottery offers you that,? Prof. Amarasekara explained. ??
??People think respect and reputation come through money. They are misguided with beliefs that this form of gambling brings a person status and character, so much so that it has now become the norm. The Technology Development helps them in their ideologies to establish these ideas further. To add to this burden, the relationship between generations are weak. So, even for the elderly, a lottery ticket is much more than just a ticket. It offers them a reason and will to momentarily escape alienation and isolation. That is why we come across individuals who have been buying lotteries for over 20 to 30 years. Age is not a barrier for this gamble,? the professor said.
?
?
?
The math of distraction?
Sri Lanka has a plethora of lottery tickets on sale under the banners of the NLB and DLB. In the most popular lottery under the NLB, the Mahajana Sampatha is drawn four times a week. It involves the selection of an alpha-numeric number from a machine comprising seven compartments. Each compartment contains 25 letters or numbers. When the draw takes place, one character of the alphabet except letter ?I? and a six-digit number are drawn as the winning combination. But what does this mean for those who buy the lottery ticket with dreams of winning big? ??
We approached Mathematician Mithrarathna Kanaththage to do the math for us. According to him, the chances of hitting the jackpot with the Mahajana Sampatha lottery are 1 in 25 million. Mr. Kanaththage broke down the formula in simple terms as following. Given the numerical combinations of 001 to 999, the probable winning numbers amount to 25 million combinations. What is even more mind-boggling is the super prize of Rs. 10 million is only awarded for a winning combination drawn every 7 or 8 draws, meaning that more prize money is allocated every time there is no winner for a draw. According to data available for this calculation, the NLB earns a revenue of around Rs. 50 million each week. Even though the jackpot is not awarded, consolation prizes amounting to Rs. 20-30 million are awarded to respective alpha-numeric combinations. Still, the NLB earns several millions in profits, weekly through this venture. ??
As the unity government is keen on cutting down waste and unnecessary expenditure in government departments and statutory bodies, it certainly is not prudent to consolidate the various Lottery organisations in the country. However if the price hikes are introduced to uplift the lives of lottery dealers as the Finance Minister claims, we are forced to ask, at what cost will these measures pay off? ??
The lottery optimises its game to draw the most money out of people, and the lottery dealer -- a seller of dreams-- thriving on hope himself. The money is supposed to go to various developments and social services. We doubt if the ordinary buyer of dreams were aware of his or her chances of winning in exactly 25 million possible outcomes, the development and social service oriented lotteries would seem far less dignified and the gamblers increasingly disheartened. ?

The untold truth about the lucrative Lottery business
	
?
Since tabling the budget 2017 in Parliament, protests seem to be a daily occurrence in Sri Lanka. Joining the sundry movements and causes this week, lottery agents and salesmen took to the streets against the government?s decision to increase the price of lottery tickets with effect from January 1. Meanwhile, the Finance Minister retaliated with the argument that if the agents failed to sell their tickets, the government would be compelled to recruit new agents. The lottery ticket salesmen, agitated and aggravated by this announcement, are now convinced that the government had pushed its luck too far. In this backdrop, the Dailymirror?approached a few lottery ticket agents and salesmen as well as mathematicians and sociologists to uncover the hidden truths of legal gambling. ??
?
Lottery dealers lament burdensome price hike
?
Although a majority lit fire crackers to mark the dawning of the year, Lottery salesmen island-wide remained in deep though, contemplating about the dilemma they are dragged into. Unlike yester years, there was no milk rice cooked on the stoves of their homes. The beginning of 2017 did not give them the feeling of renewal to set up their shops and start anew. The New Year?s dawn did not give them anything other than a surprising 25% Value Added Tax (VAT) increment on their means of survival. The controversial lottery price hike was the government?s New Year gift to the innocent lottery distributors and sellers. ??
A lottery is a form of legalised gambling that involves the drawing of numbers for a grand prize. It indirectly provides for the government to boost its revenue without further raising taxes. But for the first time in Sri Lankan history, the Finance Ministry levied taxes on lottery tickets. This forced lottery sellers to boycott selling lotteries. ??
The All Island Lottery Dealers? Society (AILDS), along with the lottery distributors, united in their battle against the government?s decision to impose the price hike on lotteries. ?
?
Island-wide protests opposing the price hike
The Development Lottery Board (DLB) and National Lottery Board (NLB), the two main bodies that sell lotteries, imposed a price increase, raising the minimum price of a lottery ticket from Rs.20 to Rs.30 with effect from January 1, 2017. Two separate circulars that bore the bad news were sent to sales agents last November. Before the massive protest in Pettah, lottery dealers islandwide boycotted sales in Kandy, Dambulla, Kurunegala, Thalawakele, Kalutara, Kahawatte, Badulla, Hatton, Bandarawela and Anuradhapura areas. Several protests were organised while black armbands were worn by those who sold tickets under protest on Sunday. The closure of lottery ticket stalls and the protests caused a significant loss for the government. ??
The circulars authorised by DLB Chairman/CEO Romesh Jayawardene (dated December 16) and NLB Chairperson Shamila Perera (dated December 23) notified sales agents islandwide that the price of a lottery ticket would soar up to Rs.30.00 according to the budget 2017 adopted in Parliament. However, according to these circulars, the price hike is not applicable for the instant lotteries sold by the DLB. ??
Furthermore, the circulars note that after deducting all taxes, sales representatives are entitled to a commission of Rs.4.00 per every lottery ticket sold. Lottery agents are protesting this clause, demanding that the commission should be increased to Rs. 5.25 in agreement with the price hike. Moreover, Rs. 5.00 from the revised price will be levied as VAT, while another Rs.2.50 drawn for the fund of the prizes. ???
?
Fighting for their livelihood
The circulars only carried a general idea of the imposition of the selling price of the lotto along with the changing of the amount of cash prizes given to the customers.Dealers were in turn forced to question the circulars which, according to them, were refused to be answered by the authorities. Given the two choices, keeping their mouth shut and accepting the commission at the end of the day or fighting for what they deserved without giving the whole cake to the government, they chose the second most difficult option. The Daily Mirror witnessed this struggle of the common man and reported on their arguments. By the end of 2016, it came to our notice that there was a considerable amount of sales boycotts and protests over this issue across the country. ??
Although the lottery boards generated chunks of revenue, it is now crystal clear that the officials are unaware of the issues faced by their agents and salesmen. They are dependent on this income, while some lottery salesmen are disabled and come from low-income families. Finance Minister Ravi Karunanayake recently said the lottery salesmen earned a considerable income. However, following our encounters with a cross-section of lottery salesmen and agents islandwide, we learnt that the daily income of these sellers was below a mere Rs.500. ??
?
Distributors risking termination of contracts?
In further developments, the Chairpersons of NLB and DLB announced their decision to suspend the agreements of the lottery agents who took part in Tuesday?s protest if they failed to report to work. Addressing a media briefing yesterday, DLB Chairman Romesh Jayawardene said the board had now recruited around 100 new lottery agents. ?
?
?We have the authority to suspend those who engaged in the protest, if they have not sold lottery tickets for a period of one month. We have identified the people who were behind this protest. Several property damages have also been reported and we will take legal action against those responsible,? Mr. Jayawardene said. ??
However, NLB Chairperson Shamila Perera is of the view that the revised lottery price will remain unchanged and that the board will not bow down to the agents? unfair demands. According to the officials, 17% of the revenue earned is directed to the agents while the boards? net profit remains at 3%, which amounts to 10.12 cents. Officials of the NLB also took this opportunity to negate claims that the board would be privatised in future. They did not fail to note that agents and sales representatives who will not report to work within 30 days will face the termination of their contracts.
