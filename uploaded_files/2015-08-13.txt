Vote for any animal but not betel leaf: CBK
	
Former President Chandrika Bandaranaike said the people could vote for any animal and not for the betel leaf symbol or the hand symbol at the forthcoming general elections if they wanted to save the country from corrupt individuals.
Addressing several public meetings in Embilipitiya and the Eheliyagoda towns the former President said the UNP, the Hela Urumaya, a faction of the SLFP and the Leftist parties had joined hands on January 8 to bring about a change and to form a national government.
The JVP was not directly involved in the campaign but it supported.
?Again the main constituent parties of the national government are contesting the general elections to take forward the policy of national government.
?Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka?s Democratic Party is contesting the election in the hope of winning as a separate group. However, he will support the national government that would be formed after the election.
?The corrupt rule should be wiped out and a new system of government without political differences should be formed. It is the duty of the people to support forces that have undertaken to move forward that object.
?On the other hand, my party has fallen prey to robbers. The situation is beyond the control of President Maithripala Sirisena, even though he is the Chairman.
?The corrupt individuals cannot be expected to lead the country along the right path. The Citizen?s Force is not affiliated to any political party. A vote for the UNP is not a vote for a political party but for a movement that could build the country. Now democracy in the country has been restored and we can chase away the corrupt representatives,? she said. (Ajithlal Shantha Udaya)

Court rejects Premalal's request to vote
	
	The request of former Deputy Minister Premalal Jayasekara , who is now in remand custody, to cast his vote at Monday's general election was rejected by Pelmadulla Magistrate Dinesh Lakmal Perera today.
	The former minister and five others have been remanded in connection with the alleged killing of UNP supporter Shantha Dodangoda during the last presidential election. When the six suspects were produced in court last morning the lawyers appearing for the former deputy minister told court that he was a candidate contesting the general election and requested permission for him to cast his vote at the respective polling station. They pointed out that the law would not restrict his right to vote.
	However the lawyers who watched the interests of the aggrieved party objected. They told court that the suspect was no longer a parliamentarian and that he was an ordinary individual who was not entitled to relief under special circumstance as sought by him.
	The magistrate who upheld the objection further remanded the six suspects.(Lasantha Niroshan Perera)

Soldier gets life sentence for heroin possession
	
A former army major who was found guilty of possession of six kilograms of heroin was sentenced to life imprisonment by Colombo High Court Judge Lalith Jayasuriya.
Sentencing the prisoner, the judge said this was an offence that warranted the death sentence, but it had been confined only to statutory books. Therefore, he said, he would sentence the convict to life imprisonment.
Prosecuting Counsel Sanil Kularatne said the image of the army had been tarnished due to this heroin deal that gave financial benefits to the LTTE. Describing the convict as a traitor who betrayed not only the military but also the entire country, he sought a severe punishment that would serve as a deterrent.
The convict is Kamal Santa Kariyawasam of Ampegama, Galle. He was arrested while transporting heroin in a private bus at the Parayanakulam checkpoint. He had obtained this haul of heroin from a location in an LTTE held area.
Acting on a tip off, Murukkan Police OIC Upul Seneviratne had made arrangements for the arrest. Kariyawasam is an engineering graduate of the Kotalawala Defence Academy.(Manopriya Gunasekara)

Maithri sends hard-hitting letter to MR
	
In a hard-hitting letter to former President Mahinda Rajapaksa, President Maithripala Sirisena as the Chairman of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) today asked Mr. Rajapaksa not to raise communalism and said that he will not be appointed Prime Minister even if the party gets more than 113 parliamentary seats as there are more senior SLFPers who could be appointed as the Premier.
?
The President also said if the party did not reach the 113 mark, he could intervene to bridge the gap.
In the five-page detailed letter, the President said there were seniors such as Nimal Siripala de Silva, John Seneviratne, A.H.M. Fowzie, Chamal Rajapaksa, Susil Premajayantha, Athauda Seneviratne and Anura Priyadarshana Yapa to be picked as the Prime Minister if the UPFA secured an overall majority at the elections.
Therefore, he requested the former President to be generous and flexible, and to give his blessing for one of them to be appointed to the post. The President said it was hilarious to note Mr. Rajapaksa visiting temples with media coverage right from the day of his defeat at the January 8 election.
?In the media, I learnt of your intention to work closely with me. If you had such genuine intentions, I would like to bring to your notice certain matters. With the enactment of the 18th Amendment, people?s freedom and democratic rights were undermined. The social democratic outlook of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) suffered a serious assault as a result,? he said.
He said had the former president retired after the completion of two terms, other seniors of the party would have been afforded the opportunity to take over. Then, he said the SLFP would have produced both the President and the Prime Minister.

Packer steps down as Crown chairman
	
Australian billionaire James Packer has stepped down as chairman of Crown Resorts with the gambling tycoon taking on a new executive director role with oversight of the company's $4 billion Las Vegas casino.
According to Sydney Morning Herald, Robert Rankin will replace Mr. Packer, who will retain his role as co-chairman of the company's Melco Crown joint venture which owns and operates casinos in Macau and the Philippines.
"Crown has a pipeline of resorts globally and this is where the majority of my time will be spent," said Mr. Packer.
"Rob Rankin has my complete trust and respect as an executive and he will do an outstanding job as chairman. Given our global growth and aspirations, this is the right time for the company to make this change. I look forward to working closely with him," he said.
Mr. Packer will be alongside some familiar faces when he jets into Las Vegas, with Mariah Carey the resident artist at Caesar's Palace on the Strip.
He was appointed co-chairman of Crown in November 2014. The former Deutsche banker also runs Packer's private investment vehicle Consolidated Press Holdings.
Mr. Rankin said he was looking forward to ensuring Crown delivers on its business plan, which includes up to $10 billion of new casino developments around the world.
"James may be leaving the chairman's role, but he will have day-to-day engagement and will be actively involved at board level to ensure we meet our targets and ambitious development goals," said Mr. Rankin.
Crown, half owned by Mr Packer, missed a full-year profit forecast on Thursday with normalised net profit falling by 17 per cent to $525 million. A consensus of analysts had forecast normalised net profit of $531 million.

Video: Power devolution through ?Grama Rajya? system: Ranil
	
	A United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) government would devolve power up to the village level according to a ?Grama Rajya? system but will not adopt federalism, Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe said today.
	He told a media briefing that power would be devolved only to village elders and religious leaders and not to politicians in accordance with the ?Grama Rajya? system.
	Meanwhile, he denounced the allegations made by the UPFA that UNFGG had associated with pro LTTE groups.
	?Prabhakaran informed me in 2005 that he will help me to become the President if I agreed to his demands. I refused then and why would I listen to pro LTTE forces now especially when we can win an election without them?,? he questioned. (Yohan Perera and Chaturanga Pradeep)WATCH ?

Thajudeen case delayed by govt. institutions-Sister
	
Aisha Thajudeen, the sister of the popular ruggerite, Wasim Thajudeen, who died under mysterious circumstances, said that the case had dragged on due to delays on the part of government institutions.
Speaking to Daily Mirror, she said the family has been avoiding the media with good reason, and that everybody should understand that no-one would intentionally remain silent when a member of his or her own family dies under suspicious circumstances. ?It took one and half years for the Judicial Medical Officer (JMO) to discover the cause of death, and additional one and half years for the Government Analyst to deliver his report. So three years were wasted due to delays by government institutions. When it came up in January the case became very active, and I now have confidence in the CID.
?The case was heard many times in court, but there was no cause of death given for one and half years. Then there was no support for us and I didn?t think it was the correct time for us to have got involved. But in the current political environment, and with the CID taking up the case, we know that something is going come right,? she said.
Speaking about the long, silent battle for justice over the death of her brother, she said, ?A case was filed immediately after the incident occurred, and I remember giving evidence at the first court hearing. When the judge asked me if I suspected anybody I said that the death was suspicious but that I did not suspect anybody because my brother had as many friends as possible.?
She said that Thajudeen had no enemies and that he was a favourite with everyone.
When asked about rumours that a former VVIP?s son was involved in the incident, Aisha refused to comment as the case was still going on.(Kamanthi Wickramasinghe)
