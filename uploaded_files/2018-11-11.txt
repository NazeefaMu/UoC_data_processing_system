MPs putting a price on their value, Speaker's behaviour led to dissolution: Prez
	
In a special statement, President Maithripala Sirisena today said the parliament was dissolved due to the sad situation where elected MPs were putting a price on their value and the 'amazing behaviour' of Speaker Karu Jayasuriya.
The President said it was unfortunate to note that some MPs had put a price on their value when the two main political camps were attempting to show the majority in parliament.?
?This was one of the main reasons which led to the dissolution of parliament. The other reason was the ?amazing behaviour? of the Speaker. Initially, he agreed to accept Mahinda Rajapaksa as the Prime Minister and several days later, he said he recognizes Ranil Wickremesinghe as the Prime Minister. In the meantime, some MPs said a tense situation was possible on the day the parliament was scheduled to reconvene. Therefore, I decided to dissolve parliament so that the people of Sri Lanka can reelect a new set of MPs who are clean and genuine," he said.?
He said he would support the Election Commission in conducting a free and fair election and requested everyone to provide their fullest corporation to the Commission, the Police Department and the armed forces.?
The President also requested all former ministers, deputy ministers, state ministers and MPs to return the state vehicles and other state properties. "Only the members of the caretaker government will be allowed to use state vehicles and properties," he said.?

Will stand up to executive no matter what it costs me - Karu
	
Former Speaker Karu Jayasuriya today said the Executive Branch has seized the rights and usurped the powers of Members of Parliament who were elected to represent the people.
In a statement, he said the willful disregard demonstrated by the executive towards Parliament, the engine of Sri Lanka?s sovereignty, leaves the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens at grave risk of similar abuse.
?Under these dire circumstances, I urge all public servants who have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution to revisit that oath. Ask why we are required to pledge fealty to this document and not to any one person or a single position of power. Our foremost duty is to the Constitution. I ask all public servants across the country to remember their obligations to this supreme law of our motherland, and to safeguard the independence of the public service, police and the judiciary. I call upon all public servants to refuse to execute any illegal orders they may receive, no matter from whom,? he said.
He said every citizen who is entrusted with responsibilities under the Constitution should think first of the country and not of party politics or personal affiliations.
The full statement of Karu Jayasuriya:
?The leaders of several political parties represented in Parliament have informed me that they will be challenging the purported dissolution of Parliament in the Supreme Court. Since the President has prevented Parliament from ruling on the legitimacy of the President?s actions, it will be up to the Supreme Court to determine the legality of these actions.
As the custodian of Parliament, I have watched over the last two weeks as the executive Branch has seized the rights and usurped the powers of Members of Parliament who were elected to represent the people. The willful disregard demonstrated by the executive towards Parliament, the engine of Sri Lanka?s sovereignty, leaves the rights and freedoms of ordinary citizens at grave risk of similar abuse.
Under these dire circumstances, I urge all public servants who have sworn an oath to defend the Constitution to revisit that oath. Ask why we are required to pledge fealty to this document and not to any one person or a single position of power. Our foremost duty is to the Constitution. I ask all public servants across the country to remember their obligations to this supreme law of our motherland, and to safeguard the independence of the public service, police and the judiciary. I call upon all public servants to refuse to execute any illegal orders they may receive, no matter from whom.
Every citizen who is entrusted with responsibilities under the Constitution should think first of the country and not of party politics or personal affiliations. We must all act with patriotism and independence to safeguard the future of democracy in our country.
I lament that the purported Foreign Minister, a highly regarded politician, has falsely alleged that I intended to prevent the President from delivering the Statement of Government Policy when Parliament was set to reconvene on 14th November. It is on this imaginary premise that the Minister suggests that Parliament had to be dissolved.
I wish that the purported minister had proposed a more honest and plausible excuse for the actions of his colleagues, that would have drawn less ridicule to our country on the world stage. Based on this fiction, several of his cohorts have openly threatened to send me to jail.
The actions of the Speaker and Parliament may not always be aligned with the wishes of the executive. This tradition of parliamentary independence dates to at least 1641, when Speaker William Lenthall of the House of Commons shielded members of that house from being arrested by King Charles I. He knelt before his king and said ?May it please your majesty, I have neither eyes to see nor tongue to speak in this place but as this house is pleased to direct me whose servant I am here; and humbly beg your majesty?s pardon that I cannot give any other answer than this is to what your majesty is pleased to demand of me.?
A floor vote on the legitimacy of the government was requested by 124 Members of Parliament. 116 Members met me in person. Another eight thereafter contacted me and expressed their support of this motion. Just as Speakers of Parliaments have done for centuries before us, I ruled in favour of the rights of the majority of Members and political parties represented in Parliament and declared that I would allow a floor vote. No member made request that the Statement of Government Policy be prevented nor would I have entertained such a request.
As a former military officer, I have always been prepared to make whatever sacrifice that my country may require of me. It has been my privilege to stand up to the executive and defend the rights of Parliament, the supremacy of our Constitution and the sovereignty of the people.
For the record I am prepared to face any consequences for these actions without hesitation.?
