Sampath Bank unveils drive-through ATM at Colombo Super Branch
	
In line with its commitment to providing the highest levels of service to its customers, Sampath Bank commissioned a drive-through automated teller machine (ATM) at its Colombo Super Branch premises, located at No: 103, Dharmapala Mawatha, Colombo 7.
The ATM was ceremonially unveiled by Sampath Bank Managing Director Nanda Fernando in the presence of the members of the bank?s corporate management, on November 7.
The drive-through ATM provides Sampath Bank customers with a host of services including cash withdrawals, cardless cash facility, credit card settlements, utility bill payments, mobile cash facilities, balance inquiries and many more.?
The customers of other banks too can withdraw cash at this ATM using their American Express, Cirrus, Diner?s Club, Mastercard, Maestro, Union Pay and Visa credit and debit cards.
Located securely within the branch premises, it provides an added layer of safety and convenience as the patrons of the ATM can drive in through a dedicated entry driveway and access its services from within their vehicles, 24 hours a day, seven days a week and 365 days a year. This eliminates the need to park one?s vehicle, walk up to the ATM, complete the transaction and get back to the vehicle.
The new ATM joins Sampath Bank?s network of 387 ATMs around the island, which includes Sri Lanka?s first banking robot that works in the form of a humanoid teller that was unveiled at the bank?s head quarters branch recently.
Sampath Bank has strengthened this network further by joining LankaPay, the largest ATM network in the country, which enables customers to transact at over 3,000 ATMs islandwide.

Shelton Wirasinha and the parameters of education
	
The inaugural Shelton Wirasinha Oration was held at Wesley College on Thursday, October 19 and was presided over by the inimitable Kumar de Silva.
Kumar de Silva
Probably many people feel about the weather these days as I do: It?s bewildering. You can never tell where it?s headed to, whether it?s going to drizzle, pour, or simply overwhelm. What happens more often than not, therefore, is that an already gridlock-choked Colombo becomes even more throttled and suffocated with bumper-to-bumper traffic on weekday evenings, a problem because, one Thursday evening last month, I had to be at a particular school several kilometres away from where I usually am (my office) within 20 minutes. Not difficult, but that?s only if you don?t account for the sudden downpour, which on this blessed evening materialised. Neither the rain nor the police-officers on the road, however, could keep me or my taxi driver from reaching our destination, and so at 4.45 p.m. I was at Wesley College, drenched to my fingers, waiting for Kumar de Silva to open up what he told me was a very, very promising Oration.? ?
To those of us who haven?t been to Wesley and to those who have been to Wesley after the eighties, the person around whom this Oration revolved remains a mystery. I first heard the name when I sat down for an interview with the gentle, suave Saliya Pieris, the fundamental rights lawyer whose anecdotes I put down on paper and print years ago. Pieris had been, as he told me, an avid quizzer, a fanatical stickler for facts and figures and statistics, which had got him to what was then Sri Lanka?s premier Quiz Show: The Dulux Do You Know Contest. Heading that contest, as part-organiser and presenter, was a gentleman whose entire life, career, and views on education that Kumar expounded on and ravishingly for us, that evening. The gentleman, incidentally, was Shelton Wirasinha.? ?
Shelton Wirasinha
I sat down in the Wesley College Hall. The coloured glass, partly shattered, the piano, the stage, and the table and chair on the stage all stared back at me. The sleek blend of passion and piety that the College Choir gave out impressively in their performances, the preparatory speeches by various officials, and the half-whispers that everyone around were engaged in helped make me forget the torrential deluge outside. Moreover, the piano and the stage, brought together, took me back to an earlier, gentler era, of the Wesleyans and the Methodists who had, true to their American roots, musicalised the experience of ordinary Christians the world over. And then, as I was contemplating on the quaintness of it all, Kumar came and began to speak. I took down notes, recorded what he had to say and tried to the best of my ability to jump to certain conclusions.? ?
Shelton Wirasinha?s life in itself deserves, I believe, an entire biography. Born in 1923 in Richmond Hill, Galle, he was educated at Richmond College and educated so well that he walked away with prizes for participation and victory as a debater, a dramatist, a scout, an athlete, a musician, and a cricketer. As a scholar too he triumphed, winning the prestigious Darrel Medal for Best Student. A student with so much promise could only be a lawyer or a doctor or an engineer, in the general scheme of things. But this student dared to disagree: he wanted to be a teacher, because he wanted to share what he had learnt. His first stint at teaching, at St Anthony?s College Rakwana, ended with him contracting cerebral malaria; after a short stint at St Peter?s College in Colombo, he returned to Richmond College as Vice-Principal. The year was 1947. About 10 years later, as the Principal, he would inaugurate Sri Lanka?s oldest school quiz club.? ?
The futurists, on the other hand, are specialists; they want to divide knowledge into several streams, cut off from each other so much that doctors don?t know how to paint and painters don?t know the first thing about first aid
In 1961 he left Richmond College for Wesley College, where having assumed duties as Principal he waded through the difficult years of government takeovers and shifts in the national education policy. Having encountered the ?difficult choice? of either going for the State or embracing a non-fee-levying model that would depend on private donations, Wirasinha and Wesley opted for the latter. It was around this time that Kumar made his entrance, being admitted in 1968 and surviving a tumultuous period in our education sector (owing to the syllabus change from the Ordinary/Advanced Level model to the NCGE/HNCE model that was aborted right after the government responsible for it was ousted).?
 ?
Wirasinha, enduring all this, took to teaching Kumar personally, given that the latter happened to be the only student at the time who had offered English, French, and German for his A Levels (a choice that was to follow his life as journalist, broadcaster, comp?re, and raconteur). He knew his poets (Wordsworth, de la Mare, Keats) and he knew his playwrights (especially Shakespeare), so what Kumar learnt about these poets and playwrights, he learnt from his Principal. Having retired in 1983, Wirasinha then served as the presenter of the Do You Know Contest right until his death two years later. Two days before his passing away, he was reading William Faulkner?s ?As I Lay Dying?. I have not read it, and neither has Kumar (though he was asked to by his erstwhile guru). The date, incidentally, was November 13, 1985. Eleven days later, he would have turned 62.? ?
What of the man?s character? Kumar told us of his perseverance and of his, at times erratic, unpredictable behaviour: How, for instance, he would go on teaching him long after the interval bell had rung and would accompany the hungry English student to the tuck-shop and get him excused long after the interval was over (?The prefects, obnoxious as they were, took delight in pulling me up. I had the perfect cover. I would say, ?Ask the Principal.? They dared not?). He was also a fervent believer in the cane, which Kumar affirmed (?You used the cane and corrected the child?) and yet also in nurturing the student?s innate sensibilities, which is how, during his tenure, a horde of teachers and children who tilted towards the arts made a mark for themselves in their respective cultural spheres; among the teachers, Felix Premawardhana and Cyril Wickramage; among the students, Givantha Arthasad and Kamal Addaraarachchi (who was given the encouragement to act in Gamini Fonseka?s Sagarayak Meda that he needed but did not get from his parents, to whom he lied for his first role; the rest, they say, is history).? ?
In fact what emerges from Kumar?s Oration is the portrait of a polyglot as a teacher. Because he was just that; a polyglot, who knew almost everything under the sun. It was an almost self-contradictory man who resided in him; on the one hand he believed firmly in education as a means of emancipating the mind (without focusing only on jobs), and yet on the other he believed as firmly in obtaining technical skills and gaining employment.? ?
The shift from the one to the other was, naturally, a sign that the times were changing; he had been a polyglot who had received his education from a system that would become more democratised, more open, and hence more pressuring and employment-oriented. (The much heralded Medium Term Plan for education under the Sirimavo Bandaranaike government, which substituted the NCGE and HNCE for the Ordinary and Advanced Levels, was implemented 12 years after Wirasinha became Principal.) This shift affected the content of the subjects he had loved as well; at the time of his retirement, we had moved from Leavis?s Great Tradition of Austen and Eliot and embraced contemporary poets and novelists, including Gabriel Okara. Kumar remembered how he got his former student to teach him these writers and their works for his private tuition classes, after his retirement. ?Such was his humility!? the student remembered the teacher in his tribute.? Broadly speaking there is and always has been two schools of thought that dominate our education discourse; those who believe in the good old days and those who look to the future. The nostalgic tree-dwellers, so the discourse goes, believe in an education system which imparts as much knowledge, and wisdom, as possible in the student without extrapolating and finding out whether that knowledge and wisdom are practical and can obtain employment. The futurists, on the other hand, are specialists; they want to divide knowledge into several streams, cut off from each other so much that doctors don?t know how to paint and painters don?t know the first thing about first aid. I am of course being simplistic there, but my point is (and this is something Kumar implied in his Oration) that this so-called discourse has for so long been embroiled in a conflict between those two schools; a conflict which never existed among the likes of Shelton Wirasinha. I never met the man, I never studied at any of the schools he taught at, but I do know this: he was an educationist who believed in the congruence of education and employment without those needless doomsday predictions about which subjects were worthy of jobs and careers and which are not. Kumar himself, I daresay, is a fine and good example of that.? ?
So yes, I did enjoy Kumar?s Oration. The man has that rare ability to keep his audiences transfixed (which is why I am surprised, if not shocked, that it took more than 10 screen tests for him to become Bonsoir?s presenter back in the eighties), with just the right blend of wit, sobriety, and soul-searching that an Oration of this sort needs. Did I know Shelton Wirasinha any better? Yes. Do we all miss him, and the likes of him? Yes. Can we look forward to the day when the likes of him will flourish? For our sake and for the sake of generations to come in this blessed country of ours, I certainly hope so.? ? ?

THE TRAGEDY OF THE LIONEL WENDT
	
My father?s good friend was the late Lionel Wendt ? His brother Harry was my godfather. As I was told the beautiful mansion belonging to Lionel was filled with music and art -- those who wanted to be a part of it dropped in and enjoyed it.? ?
So Lionel left behind a legacy ? a Trust to continue the works in his Home, and all to appreciate it.? ?
I was a small girl when the Lionel Wendt theatre was built ? the model still lies in the theatre ? the original plan had cinema, music rooms, stage with effects even at that time, which no other theatre has, dressing rooms, fly-overs, ballet effects, drive-in and parking, exhibition halls.? ?
Often my father dropped by to see how the building was progressing and I went with him. I strode the foundations of the Wendt, waiting until he finished.? ?
Apart from my childhood I have played many drama roles on stage there ? The Wendt has the best acoustics, easy to fill audience facilities, and a spacious balcony.? ?
What has happened to all these now??
LIONEL WENDT ?
Phoning the Wendt for details of performances has become impossible ? there is a guy in the front house who may answer you and can never put you through to those in the inner room in charge. I used to get newsletters and have inquired many times, but it has stopped months and years ago! The Facebook page is inactive. Emailing them is useless as there is no reply. There is no way of making genuine inquiries ? from all those being paid good salaries.?
?
What about the building and various items?? ?
One is searched still by poking of hands into the handbag, long after the war was over. Maybe they are searching for food and what is wrong with food? Even abroad they sell or carry food into the hall. There are cleaners and pest control if the problem is crumbs on the floors. After all the Wendt charges a big amount from the producers of the plays and performances. Cleaners can be afforded ? What happens to children who go hungry? Every theatre abroad allows eatables to be partaken of during performances ? We have to leave the food on a dusty rack outside and if you are diabetic or such, you have to come out for a munch! Much like smoking! The dear old Cadju seller and his nice daughter have been dispensed with. The bar is a congested, crowded mess. No eats there either.? ?
The seating in the Lobby is far too low for elders ? nothing to hold onto when rising. The doors are not opened till a few minutes before play time. Sometimes a long wait, and especially if the unsuitable seating is full.? ?
Lionel Wendt Photographs, exhibition catalogue, 1994, Colombo
The seating inside is now out of date ? they have to be replaced. A few seats should be provided along the corridor for those waiting for their pick-up. The security table and seat are good for the dust bin!? ?
A restoration is badly necessary and the Trustees seem to be uninterested. I spoke with one such eminent Trustee some time ago, and he agreed with me, but nothing has happened. I looked for email addresses of the others on the website and newspapers, and they are not given.If you are a Trustee you should be accessible?so hence this public article.? ?
I am sure there are funds for this restoration and repair ? with all the astronomical charges ? any the less, a charity tax free donation for this venture can be started.? ?
Get going Trustees, call for tenders and make the Lionel Wendt what it used to be, and not to join the ancient buildings of Anuradhapura!? ?

Budget 2018 today! A stressed out nation awaits ?fuel?
	
Democracy, reconciliation and development are the three main pillars on which the Unity Government has been formed in order to fulfill the economic needs as well as the aspirations of the masses of the country
Many await, with their fingers crossed, Budget 2018 which is all set to be read in Parliament today. Last September, the Ministry of Finance called for proposals from different stakeholders including the general public, to be included in Budget 2018. However, to what extent these proposals would be accepted and applied in future is a question that will stay surfaced in the reader?s imagination until the Budget speech is completely read. A recent Finance Ministry statement stated, ?Democracy, reconciliation and development are the three main pillars on which the Unity Government has been formed in order to fulfill the economic needs as well as the aspirations of the masses of the country?. Hence, with only a few hours left before we know whether Budget 2018 would be a people friendly one or not, Daily Mirror spoke to a few professionals, including the public, in an attempt to know what their expectations are and what they would have proposed to be included in Budget 2018. Excerpts of their comments and proposals concerning what they would like Budget 2018 to include are as follows.?
Greater emphasis should be given to railway development and improving the bus transport sector-Prof. Amal Kumarage
Explaining the need to allocate funds for the transport sector, Senior Professor at the Department of Transport and Logistics Management, University of Moratuwa Amal Kumarage said that traditionally, the Government has been spending 200 -250 billion rupees on the transport sector of which, over 150 ? 200 billion have been spent on highways and the road development sector. He noted that building new roads is not going to help reduce traffic congestion.?
?
?It is time to realize that other modes of transport need similar investment. The most suitable mode of transport is operating at a meagre scale. There must be a greater emphasis on railway development, developing modern railways, transporting freight by railway and improving the bus service including bus priority lanes. The country also invested on reforming the bus sector as it is the industry that can help most in reducing congestion and improving passenger mobility. This is a service that can be turned around within one to two years. Therefore, I?m expecting that bus reform projects such as SAHASARA and school bus programmes such as SISUSARIYA and the bus priority lanes that have already been started will receive funding for the next two to three years? Prof. Kumarage opined.?
?
He expects to see investment made on improving traffic management and safety on roads, noting that traditionally, these areas of concern have received little funding through the budget. He also hopes that the Budget should allocate funds for the Traffic Police to purchase more equipment and technology to manage traffic.? ?

We need a time based relief to refurbish our properties?- Srilal Miththapala
Implying what may benefit the tourism industry if provisions are made in Budget? 2018, Former Tourist Hotels Association of Sri Lanka? President Srilal Miththapala explained how this industry can benefit through tax concessions. Miththapala said that what is needed in the tourism sector? is a consolidation of taxes since the hotel and tourism industry is? currently paying some of the highest taxes. ?For an example, if we? charge Rs. 100 from a customer we only get a profit of Rs. 70 from the bill because we must pay the taxes for service charges as? well. This is where we find it very difficult because unlike in other? businesses, we can?t pass on all these burdens to the customer. If we? pass on this thirty percent to the customer, we will stop being? competitive in the market,? Miththapala added. Stating that Sri Lanka is? turning out to be too expensive for guests, partly due to these huge expenses, he? explained that he understands the Government?s need to impose taxes.? However, Miththapala said that imposing of such taxes should be done using a? consolidated and proper method.
?Secondly, it?s important to have a? consistent policy regarding tax instead of constantly changing it annually, leading us? to adjust our prices accordingly on an annual basis.
Thirdly, we need a? time based relief for the refurbishing of our properties. Since we are? playing in the international arena, our properties must be refurbished? in order to maintain international standards. For this purpose, we? need to import equipment which is often priced high. Therefore, it will? be very useful if we can have duty free imports for such products. Also,? we need duty free relief to import energy conserving equipment such as? energy saving air conditioners. Since the hotel industry is an industry? that consumes much electricity, if we can obtain duty free? concessions for at least a short period it would be very helpful in this? aspect,? he said.? ?

Without borrowings, it?s difficult to improve public investment-? Prof. Sirimal Abeyratne
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Professor in Economics at the University of Colombo Sirimal Abeyratne shared his views from an economic perspective, about what can be included in Budget 2018. He believes that if the Government is serious about including fiscal management in the Budget, better expenditure proposals should be proposed. He stated that this is mainly because the total tax collection is barely sufficient for repaying the annual loan installment. ?Given the situation, it is important that we need to make certain corrections and perhaps they are painful corrections that we need to make starting from now on because 2017, 2018 are years of grey. These are bonus years that would help us prepare for 2019 with the introduction of the New Inland Revenue Bill? Prof. Abeyratne said.?
?
He said that with an anticipated increase in tax revenue, there is also scope to bring in some popular expenditure proposals. ?We are improving on the income side, but we are again spending this improved income on temporary things without considering our rising debt burden or without thinking of our long-term expenditure cut and improvement in fiscal management. In terms of public investment, it should be noted that this is entirely based on borrowings to date because our tax revenue wasn?t sufficient to cover even the recurring expenditure. Even part of the recurring expenditure have come from borrowings. Currently, without borrowings it is difficult to improve public investment further. Private investment is an alternative available although public investment is equally important. Also, it?s important to improve our business environment? Prof. Aberatne added.?

Promote solar energy for efficient electricity supply- Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardana
Speaking to the Daily Mirror, Environmental Lawyer Jagath Gunawardana suggested that it would be a better move if the Government can focus on promoting the use of solar energy. He said that this could be done by providing concessions to people to install solar panels in their buildings. He said that this measure would help in facilitating an efficient electricity supply to the community. Also, there should be some tax concessions on certain technologies such as solar panels for electricity, water purification technologies and on certain other technologies that cause minimum harm to the environment like substitutes for polythene.? ?
?The second sector we would like the Government to promote is electric cars. If we can have solar panels installed in households, people will also be encouraged to buy solar powered vehicles since they can charge their vehicle batteries at zero cost. This is also another area where the vehicle importers can be provided with concessions. On the other hand, the importing of vehicles, which consume a lot of fuel, should be discouraged by increasing the taxes on them,? he said.?
?
?Moreover, he added that the Budget should allocate funds to promote alternative energy sources such as renewable energy. He added that this is where solar energy emerges from in a big way that people have not thought before. ?Also, one other factor that should be taken into account is our natural resources that are being exported. We should identify a means of making them value added products and not export any raw materials. In case we don?t have the technology, it is better to get down the technology to Sri Lanka rather than exporting our natural resources abroad for a minimum cost,? he said.?
?
?There was a Cabinet decision back in 2007 which makes all minerals subject to value addition when they are exported, but I proposed that this should also be extended to forest produce and everything else that are being exported. When they are converted into value added products, this will generate more money and supply more jobs to the country. Also certain areas in the agricultural sector needs to be promoted by providing concessions for organic fertilizer, soil conditions such as compost while also promoting technologies and innovations in this sector? he added. He also stressed that it?s important to increase the allocation of funds through the budget for research and development in the agricultural sector.?

DFCC September profit hurt by fair value losses on forex, higher credit cost and overheads
	
Core banking performance strong as bank?s new loans, new deposits robust
?
DFCC Bank PLC reported strong top line growth supported by robust core banking performance during its September quarter (3Q17) on strong loan growth but the bottom line was hampered due to a multitude of factors.
?
The development lender-turned commercial bank reported Rs.427.4 million net profit for the quarter under review, compared to Rs.953.8 million for the same period last year. This was a decline of 55 percent year-on-year (YoY).
The bottom line performance was hurt by fair value losses in respect of forward exchange rate contracts, higher credit costs and overheads, predominantly the staff cost.
The fair value losses from the forward contracts held with other commercial banks and the Central Bank amounted to Rs.836.8 million against just Rs.66.8 million loss for the similar period last year.
Meanwhile, higher provisions made against possible bad loans also rose sharply during the quarter from a year ago.
While the specific provisions rose by 38 percent YoY to Rs.314 million, the general provisions rose to Rs.183.3 million from just Rs.23.4 million provided against the profit during the same quarter last year.
This is on the back of a strong growth in loans and receivables as the bank on a standalone gave out Rs.17.7 billion in new loans during the nine months to September, recording an increase of 9.2 percent.
The bank has a total loans and receivables book of slightly above Rs.210 billion and the bank grew its assets by 11 percent to Rs.322.7 billion during the period.
The asset quality was hurt slightly as the gross non-performing loan ratio rose to?
3.24 percent from 2.97 percent at the start of the year.
For the quarter, the banking group increased its net interest income by 22 percent to Rs.2.94 billion albeit the faster growth in interest expenses against its corresponding income.
However, the bank managed to increase its net interest margin to 3.6 percent from?
3.3 percent.
Although the low-cost deposit base is still 17 percent, the lowest among the licensed commercial banks, the bank in a statement said it ?continues to enjoy medium to long-term concessionary credit lines, which has helped the bank to maintain low cost of funds.
When considering these funding lines and the low-cost deposits, the ratio improves to 26.5 percent in September 2017?.
Development lenders such as DFCC Bank still has the luxury of receiving concessionary credit lines from mainly multi-lateral lenders such as the World Bank and Asian Development Bank although in recent times the availability of such funds have become scarce.
Meanwhile, the bank managed to mobilize new deposits of Rs.46.7 billion during the nine months, recoding a strong growth of 33.2 percent.
On a quarter-on-quarter basis, deposits grew by Rs.18.8 billion or 11 percent.
The total overheads rose by 23.4 percent year-on-year to Rs.1.44 billion of which the employment cost rose by the highest percentage of 34 percent.?
Meanwhile, the bank on a standalone basis, made a gain of Rs.1,073 million on the sale of shares of Commercial Bank it held under the available-for-sale financial assets.
As a result, the total gain from financial investments for the nine months rose to Rs.1.68 billion at group level, which also included the dividend income received from its group entities and other investments, from Rs.736.7 million gain in the same quarter last year.
For the nine months, the banking group reported earnings of Rs.3.34 billion or Rs.12.59 a share, compared to Rs.2.66 billion profit or Rs.10.02 a share in the same period last year with an increase of 26 percent.
The Sri Lankan government controls a 33.54 percent stake in DFCC through Bank of Ceylon, Sri Lanka Insurance and the Employees? Provident Fund.
Hatton National Bank remains the second largest shareholder with a 12.22 percent stake.?

Dhamma Teaching for Daily Life
	
A talk by Bhante Vimalaramsi Mahathera from the USA at the Light of Asia Centre in Pelawatta, Battaramulla on Friday, November 10, 2017 at 8.00 pm.?
The Most Venerable Bhante Vimalara<U+1E41>si Mahathera (born 1946) became a Buddhist monk in 1986. He went to Burma in 1988 to practise intensive meditation at the famous meditation centre Mahasi Yeiktha in Rangoon. On May 17, 2011, he was conferred the title of Sasana Tilakana, by The Supreme Sangha Council of Bangladesh. It was awarded for his intense work on preserving and teaching the Buddha Dhamma in the West.? ?
Bhante Vimalara<U+1E41>si came back to the USA in 1998. He has been teaching meditation throughout the country and abroad since that time. In 2003 he co-founded the United International Buddha-Dhamma Society, UIBDS with Sasana Dipika Khanti Khema who was the first woman Samaneri to take novice ordination under an American Mahathera monk on American soil.? ?
UIBDS supports the Dhamma Sukha Meditation Center located near Annapolis, Missouri, in the USA. Bhante teaches meditation onsite from May through October each year. The balance of the year is spent travelling around the world giving retreats and talks. He has given retreats in Europe, Asia, SE Asia, and America.? ?
How did Bhante find this practice of TWIM?? ?
In 1995 Bhante began to study the Suttra texts more thoroughly and he practised meditation according to the Suttras.?
?
After a three-month self-retreat in a Cave in Thailand, he wrote a book on the Mindfulness of Breathing called ?The Anapanasati Suttra: A Practical Guide to Mindfulness of Breathing and Tranquil Wisdom Meditation?. Today it is estimated that more than a million copies of this book are circulated worldwide in 12 languages. The book has been revised and republished as, ?The Breath of Love? including instructions for Metta Meditation, Forgiveness Meditation and accompanying Walking Meditation.? ?
What makes Bhante Vimalaramsi unique is his simple style in everyday language and direct teaching from the suttras. Bhante reads several discourses directly and this has had a profound effect on the results meditators experience in practice. The meditation is not only for sitting but also if you keep it going, it will purify and retrain your mind in daily life. His book ?Life is Meditation; Meditation is Life?

Govt. to allow 500 safari jeeps to enter Yala per day
	
Amidst the opposition by environmentalists, the Ministry of Sustainable Development and Wildlife yesterday had decided to increase the number of safari jeeps entering the Yala National Wildlife Park to 500 a day, a senior official of the Department of Wildlife Conservation (DWC) said.
The decision was taken at a meeting held with the participation of Sustainable Development and Wildlife Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera, Director General of the DWC M.G.C. Sooriyabandara, Director Planning of the DWC Ranjan Marasinghe, Housing and Construction Minister Sajith Premadasa and four jeep drivers' associations whose members are permitted to conduct tours of the Yala National Park.
In a bid to solve the issue of over-crowding within the Yala National Park, the ministry last month restricted the number of safari jeeps entering the park to 200 a day-100 during the morning session and 100 more in the afternoon.
However, safari jeep drivers' associations overwhelmingly opposed the new regulation and demanded unhindered access to the park.
According to statistics maintained by the DWC, the highest number of vehicles that had entered the park on a single day during past three years was only 425 with the exception of December. As per the new regulation upto 500 jeeps would be permitted to enter the park on a single day.
President of the Independent Safari Jeep Drivers' Association P.D.Keerthi, speaking to the Daily Mirror said that they were satisfied with the decision and extended their gratitude to Minister Sajith Premadasa in this regard. According to Keerthi, it was Minister Premadasa, hailing from Hambantota district, who had fixed the meeting with Minister Gamini Jayawickrama Perera for them to be able to put forward their demands.
During the meeting, Minister Jayawickrama Perera had also decided to extend the time during which ticket counters are open for visitors. Accordingly, counters will be open from 6 to 11 am and 1 to 2 pm. The minister had earlier curtailed the ticket issuing time period in the morning to 8 am in order to address the over-visitation issue.
Former DWC Director General Sumith Pilapitya criticized the new decision and said the wildlife within the park would suffer the repercussions of it.
The DWC said that although it was earlier planning to introduce an online ticket booking method for visitors who wish to tour the Yala National Park, opposition from jeep drivers' associations, who feared that their income would be affected by this, had caused a re-think of its feasibility. Minister Perera had then advised the DWC to withdraw the issuing of tickets online. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Hathurusingha tenders his resignation to BCB
	
Chandika Hathurusingha's future with Bangladesh hangs in the balance after the coach tendered his resignation to the Bangladesh Cricket Board (BCB).
Whether that resignation will be accepted by the BCB, and if it will actually result in Hathurusingha's exit remains to be seen. Hathurusingha and top officials at the BCB have not officially confirmed these developments, but are not denying them. Meanwhile, there are strong signals from Sri Lanka Cricket that they are pursuing Hathurusingha, and are in fact presently in negotiations with him.
There have been increasing recent signs that despite Bangladesh's many improvements during his tenure, Hathurusingha is unsatisfied with the state of his present role. He had once already moved to resign in October last year, but the BCB had not accepted his resignation and Hathurusingha was convinced to continue.
Now, however there is the additional lure of a job in his home country. SLC has been on the hunt for a new head coach since Graham Ford resigned in June, and had, in fact, already approached Hathurusingha over the past three months. Though Hathurusingha had eventually rebuffed SLC on that first occasion, recent developments may have made the Sri Lanka role more attractive to Hathurusingha. SLC has just hired Hathurusingha's longtime friend and associate Thilan Samaraweera as batting coach, for one. Then there has also been a change in selection committee. ESPNcricinfo also understands that SLC is prepared to pay Hathurusingha what he presently earns with the BCB - a substantial commitment for the Sri Lankan board.
There are, of course, contractual obligations to consider here. Having been given an extension in the middle of last year, Hathurusingha has signed with the BCB until the end of the 2019 World Cup. Leaving this contract is likely to be a complicated proposition, possibly involving a months-long notice period.
If Hathurusingha does end up leaving his position, however, it will bring to an end a tenure that lasted over three years and oversaw substantial gains by the Bangladesh side, particularly in ODI cricket. In major tournaments, Bangladesh made the quarter-final of the 2015 World Cup and the semi-final of the 2017 Champions Trophy. They had also defeated India, Pakistan and South Africa in home bilateral series, and have climbed up the ODI rankings as a result.
In Tests, Bangladesh registered their first-ever wins against England and Australia at home, and against Sri Lanka away. The team has, however, recently returned from a dispiriting tour to South Africa. (espn.co.uk)

Holding SLMC election inappropriate due to legal issues: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) yesterday said it was inappropriate to hold the election of the Sri Lanka Medical Council (SLMC) having legal issues with regard to it, amidst being in a crucial condition on the SAITM issue.
GMOA Assistant Secretary Dr. Naveen De Soyza told the Daily Mirror that in 2014 they had pointed out several issues in relation to the election procedure of the SLMC and they had urged for several amendments in the said procedure.
?There have been no amendments since 2014 to 2017. However, there are about four vacancies at present in the SLMC. Earlier, we have referred proposals to the related authorities suggesting the need for amendments to a legitimate election procedure,? he added.
He said the SLMC had now approved for an amended election procedure through the Health Ministry and added that even though the council has approved of it, the legal background of it was questionable.
He said it was illegitimate and a gazette notice should be issued with regard to it through the subject minister in order to get it legalized.
?However, the SLMC is getting ready for an election and nomination has been called. The election should be only held after establishing a legitimate procedure through a gazette notice,? he added.(Kalathma Jayawardhane)

Insurance regulator renamed as Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka
	
The name of the insurance sector regulator, the Insurance Board of Sri Lanka, has been changed to the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka, with effect from October 19, 2017, consequent to an Amendment to the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act, No. 43 of 2000 by Act No. 23 of 2017.?
The amendment included two other changes to the insurance regulatory framework. One is to permit the insurance companies, which meet certain criteria, to seek exemption from the mandatory listing requirements of the Regulation of Insurance Industry Act. The rationale for providing the said exemption was on the basis that such companies are already part of a listed entity, either in Sri Lanka or abroad.?
The National Insurance Trust Fund (NITF) and Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation Ltd (SLIC) or any entities formed upon the segregation of SLIC, have been also exempted from the mandatory listing requirements as long as such entities are owned by the Government of Sri Lanka.?
The insurance companies that would be exempted from the listing requirement would have to comply with the terms and conditions as may be determined by the Insurance Regulatory Commission of Sri Lanka from time to time.
The second change is to permit the persons who are currently appointed as insurance agents of an insurance company for one class of insurance business (i.e. either long-term insurance business or general insurance business) to be appointed as agents of an insurance company for the other class of insurance business as well.?
Prior to the amendment, the law permitted an insurance agent to work only for one insurance company.?

Maldives MP alleges SL of aiding opposition coup plots
	
Maldives MP Riyaz Rasheed has accused Sri Lanka of assisting alleged opposition efforts to overthrow the Maldivian government.
Speaking at a press conference Tuesday, Riyaz said he was concerned that neighbouring countries were allowing exiled Maldivian politicians to plot attempts to oust President Abdulla Yameen, the Maldives Independent reported.
?Every Maldivian citizen has the right to believe that the efforts of opposition figures in Sri Lanka today have the possibility of disrupting our future and our independence,? the deputy parliamentary group leader of the ruling Progressive Party of Maldives said.
Riyaz later told newspaper Mihaaru that Sri Lanka?s actions suggest it wants to plunge Maldives into civil war.
?They know very well the tribulations of a civil unrest ? they were in conflict for years. Why would they want that for anybody else? But sadly, I think that?s what we?re seeing now ? the Sri Lankan government backing potential plans to overthrow a democratically elected government,? he was quoted as saying.
Riyaz previously accused Sri Lanka of harbouring ?coup plotters? in September last year after government officials told reporters it has no concerns with the activities of former president Mohamed Nasheed.
Nasheed regularly visits Colombo to meet with other opposition figures in exile. The opposition leader was controversially jailed on terrorism charges in early 2015 but was granted medical leave in a deal brokered by Sri Lanka, India, the UK and US.
Following his first trip to Sri Lanka since securing asylum in the UK, Rajitha Senaratne, Sri Lanka?s cabinet spokesman, told the Colombo Gazette that Nasheed was ?raising democratic issues? and could not be seen as plotting to overthrow the government.
The traditionally close ties between Maldives and Sri Lanka were strained in late 2015 following the arrest of a Sri Lankan ?sniper? along with the expulsion of a Maldivian social media activist. In an unprecedented move, Sri Lanka criticised a short-lived state of emergency and warned the Maldives against creating ?regional instability.?
In September this year, Nasheed?s high-profile international lawyers expressed concern about his safety after the new Maldivian ambassador to Sri Lanka threatened to detain the opposition leader in Colombo and return him to the Maldives to serve his 13-year jail sentence.
MP Riyaz, who represents the Vilufushi constituency in Thaa atoll, has a history of stirring controversy with incendiary remarks.
He led calls for the Maldives to withdraw from the Commonwealth and labelled the Queen of England ?physically challenged? on national television. In May 2015, he refused to apologise for tweets about prohibiting ?islanders? from travelling to protest in Mal?.

Man dies at fuel station
	
An unfortunate story of an individual who was waiting in a queue to get fuel for his motorbike from the Lanka Seva filling station in Uragasmanhandiya dying of a heart attack was reported on Tuesday (7) night.
The deceased has been identified as Jayantha Premalal (53) of Uthurumagala in Uragasmanhandiya who was a watcher at the Karandeniya Uthurumagala Public Cemetery.
He was among the many motorists who were left disappointed after hearing that after having stood for a long time to get their vehicles filled the petrol had run out.
After the rest had departed he had started quarrelling with the employees of the petrol shed and all of a sudden collapsed to the floor.
After some preliminary medical treatment being administered at the Uragasmanhandiya Hospital he had been transferred to the Elpitiya Hospital, where he was pronounced dead on arrival.
The fuel shortage has badly affected the residents of the town of Uragasmanhandiya where the main source of transport were motorcycles and three-wheelers.
The inquest into the death was conducted by Inquirer into Sudden Deaths B. K. P. R. Perera yesterday (8). Wife of the deceased Shirani Colombage (51) and his nephew, giving evidence, said the victim was suffering from a heart disease and had been receiving medical treatment for it from 2012. They said he had not been following the advice given to him by doctors for some time.
The death was proclaimed as being due to a heart attack. (B.P. Amarasinghe)

Mangala presents Blue-Green Budget
	
The government unveiled its Budget 2018 today outlining, among others, measures to liberalize Sri Lanka?s economy either with the amendment or the repeal of numerous existing laws and carry out what it termed a ?Blue-Green Economy using oceanic resources?.
Finance Minister Mangala Samaraweera in his maiden Budget referred to the introduction of the open market policy in 1977 but said the country lost its momentum because many of the laws were archaic.
?The Customs Ordinance was first introduced in 1869. The Excise Ordinance in 1912. The Education Ordinance in 1939. This House was able to introduce a new Inland Revenue Act (IRD) recently. Much more has to be done. For example; the Rent Act No:7 of 1972 which limits the ownership of houses and the rent to be charged requires amendments; the Paddy Lands Act No:1 of 1958 and the Agricultural Lands Act No:42 of 1973 will be amended to allow the farming of alternative crops; the Shop and Office Employees Act No.15 of 1954 will be amended allowing employees flexibility to choose their working hours and bankruptcy laws will be amended to make them more efficient. I am confident that the proposed changes will enable Sri Lanka to be a more vibrant and a dynamic market economy," he said.
Referring to the Blue-Green Economy, he said it would generate growth by utilizing what he called the much under-utilized ocean resources and facilitating the diversification of the economy with the adoption of new and sustainable technologies especially in agriculture.
For the first time, the government laid emphasis on a new vehicle policy. The minister said all vehicles in the country should be powered by non-fossil fuel sources by 2040.
?To this end, all Government vehicles will be converted to hybrid or electric vehicles by 2025. In this context, we will be introducing an appropriate incentive structure. As such, the taxes on the import of electric vehicles including electric three-wheelers, cars and buses will be reduced while rationalizing the import taxes on vehicles powered by fossil fuel. The new formula for import taxes will be based on the engine capacity which will minimize revenue leakages. The import taxes on an electric car will be reduced by at least Rs.1 million while the import tax on the high-end fossil fueled cars will be increased by almost Rs.2.5 million. We will also impose a special tax on super luxury vehicles with an engine capacity exceeding 2,500 cc.
?Proposed changes in the A/L subject combinations ensuing degree programmes in line with the STEM+A (Arts) concept will allow students to offer combinations such as Mathematics with Music, Science with Drama?etc. at the A/Ls equipping students with attributes essential to modern day demands,? he said.

Moody?s says outlook for global sovereigns stable
	
Moody?s Investors Service (Moody?s) said that its outlook for sovereign creditworthiness in 2018 is stable overall, with the healthy growth and synchronized global economic expansion of 2017 likely to continue into 2018.
?The benign state of the global sovereign credit environment is reflected in the fact that almost three-quarters of Moody?s-rated sovereigns currently hold a stable rating outlook, while the increasingly solid momentum in growth balances against the continuing risks from high debt levels as well as from elevated geopolitical tensions,? said Moody?s Managing Director for Global Sovereigns Alastair Wilson.
Moody?s conclusions are contained in its just-released ?Sovereigns -- Global: 2018 outlook stable as healthy growth tempers high debt, geopolitical tensions?. The stable outlook reflects Moody?s expectations for the fundamental credit conditions that will drive sovereign credit over the next 12-18 months.
In line with the credit environment that Moody?s foresees for sovereigns in 2018, 102 (74 percent) of the 137 Moody?s-rated sovereigns have a stable outlook, and a further 13 (10 percent) hold a positive outlook. Only 22 (16 percent) sovereigns have a negative outlook compared with 35 (26 percent) a year ago, pointing to the likelihood of fewer downward rating adjustments in 2018 compared with 2017.
?The macroeconomic environment for sovereigns is more favourable than it was a year ago,? said Wilson.
?Moody?s expects global GDP growth in 2018 to remain over 3 percent in 2018, similar to 2017. That benign economic backdrop allows governments a longer window in which to carry out economic and fiscal reforms.?
Unusually low inflation levels across both the advanced economies and many emerging markets will keep the pace of the normalization in monetary policy gradual. Moody?s does not believe that the normalization process poses a broad threat to sovereign credit. However, Moody?s report cites a number of challenges that forestall a greater improvement in global credit conditions despite the favourable global macroeconomic environment.
One is that domestic political uncertainty and social tensions weaken the commitment to economic and fiscal reform. There is progress on this front, with ongoing labour market reforms in a number of European countries as well as in Japan (A1 stable), albeit at a slow pace. Elsewhere, sovereigns including Saudi Arabia (A1 stable), the United Arab Emirates (Aa2 stable), the Philippines (Baa2 stable) and India (Baa3 positive) are implementing measures aimed at increasing fiscal space.
However, political and social considerations remain an obstacle to rapid reforms, particularly in countries such as Brazil (Ba2 negative), South Africa (Baa3 negative) and Turkey (Ba1 negative).? And while a number of European governments have implemented reforms of pension systems to postpone retirement ages, reduce benefits and/or raise contributions, much less has been done to address the forthcoming sharp increase in healthcare costs.
