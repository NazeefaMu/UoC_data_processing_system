Airbus and Benz to provide free air/land ambulance service
	
Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne said yesterday two world-renowned German companies, the Airbus and Benz have pledged to invest in an air and land ambulance service which would include 24 helicopters.
The ministry said the assurance was given to the minister during discussion with representatives of the two companies and officials of the German Government during his visit to that country. "The free ambulance package includes 24, helicopters, 1,050 ambulances and 240 breakdown vehicles. The Benz Company will invest in the ambulances and breakdown vehicles while 24 helicopters will be provided by the Air Bus Company," it said in a statement.
The investment for this huge social welfare service programme will come through a soft loan from the two companies after the minister explained the necessity for free ambulance service similar to that provided by India. Germany has undertaken to train the Sri Lankan staff and crew to operate the air and land ambulance service.
The Indian funded ?Pre-Hospital Care Emergency Ambulance Service? which was a gift by Premier Narendra Modi to Sri Lanka was launched in July last year with 88 Indian-manufactured ambulances.
At a public rally at the Norwood Grounds in Dikoya recently Prime Minister Modi assured he would expand the free ambulance service to cover the nine provinces. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Aussie explores options to rehabilitate SL refugees in TN
	
Australia is exploring options with the Tamil Nadu government and Sri Lanka to rehabilitate some Sri Lankan refugees in the State that will in turn reduce the number of refugees trying to enter Australia through illegal means, a top Australian Border Force official told The Hindu on Friday.
Roman Quaedvlieg APM, Commissioner of the Australian Border Force, met Tamil Nadu Chief Secretary Girija Vaidyanathan on Thursday and discussed options including Australian assistance in rehabilitating a number of Sri Lankan Tamil refugees in Tamil Nadu.
In an interview to The Hindu, Mr. Quaedvlieg said, ?It is in our interest that the size of the diaspora (Sri Lankan refugees) here is reduced; this in turn indirectly reduces that probability of further (illegal) maritime ventures to Australia. So, we are very interested in working with TN Govt., NGOs like IOM and UNHCR to ensure that there is a continuous resettlement programme.?
Mr. Quaedvlieg said the government of Tamil Nadu has been extending its cooperation to Australia in helping reduce the number of refugees who are illegally making their way to Australia by sea. ?There is a large diaspora of Sri Lankan Tamils who have sought refuge in Tamil Nadu; some of them have sought to enter Australia through illegal maritime means.?
According to him, there are about 100,000 refugees in India, some of whom want to go back to Sri Lanka, while some have integrated themselves with the Tamil society in the State. There are also some who were born here who wouldn?t want to go back to Sri Lanka.
?Out of that cohort, there have been some who leave these shores and travel to Australia by boats through organised people smuggling ventures,? he said.
He added that while Australia was criticised for turning back the ?boat people? ? refugees who arrive in boats ?the country had the third-largest pro-rata number of refugees. ?We are escalating our refugee programme to 18,750 refugees per year. Over and above that, we took in 12,000 extra Syrians last year,? Mr. Quaedvlieg said.

Branches to decide time duration of token strike: GMOA
	
The Government Medical Officers? Association (GMOA) said today it had allowed its district level branches to decide whether they need to extend Monday's token strike originally planed for four hours to 24 hours.
GMOA Additional Secretary Haritha Aluthge told a news conference that several district level branches were keen to extend the token strike to 24 hours.
?Our district level branches have requested us to extend this scheduled trade union action for 24 hours considering the prevailing situation. Therefore we have allowed them to decide on the duration of the token strike,? he said.
Meanwhile, Dr. Aluthge said the GMOA's district level branches in the North Western Province had confirmed they would carry out the token strike to 24 hours.
?However, emergency treatment will be carried out without interruption during the token strike,? he said.
The GMOA had earlier warned it would resort to a countrywide token strike on Monday from 8.00 am to 12.00 noon over several demands including Wednesday's tear gassing of protesting university students. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Army will call off the rescue operations at the site of the collapsed building in Wellawatte, because there is no sign of anyone trapped under the rubble, Army Spokesman Roshan Seneviratne said today.
?This is a private land. There is no evidence of further victims trapped under the rubble. We will inform the owner to continue with the rest of the work, as there was no need to deploy our personnel any further,? he said.
But Wellawatte Fire Brigade Section Officer Aruna De Silva said their personnel were continuing search operations based on information received from the workers at the site at the time the building collapsed that there were still two of their co-workers missing.
Meanwhile, the Police and the Special Task Force (STF) media said their officers they too would continue search operations.
A 31-year-old man identified as Udaya Kumara Ratnayake, a resident of Hasalaka had died while 22 others were injured in this tragedy.
Nineteen of those injured are still in hospital.
Police believe that proper quality standards had not been maintained when adding more floors to the structure, which could have resulted in the building collapsing. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Dengue an ugly epidemic beyond our control?
	
?Recent trends in dengue indicate a slight change in the disease progression
A child with dengue shock syndrome
?
As a growing epidemic with statistics indicating a sweeping rise in the number of victims falling prey to an irrepressible mosquito menace, Dengue has become one of the biggest threats that needs to be defeated by healthcare officials and the public. While eradicating mosquito breeding grounds has become a strenuous struggle, it is also surprising to note how recent trends indicate a slight change in the disease progression. With hospital staff continuously baffled by how to accommodate and provide equal attention and care to the rising number of patients being admitted to hospitals, the health sector is currently facing a huge challenge on how best to address the escalating dengue epidemic evident countrywide. Speaking to Daily Mirror, several experts representing the health sector shared their views and spoke on how best to address the dengue epidemic while highlighting the red flags that need to be tackled. Excerpts of their comments are given below.?
	?Other than Paracetamol, any other medication should not be administered
	
	
	?Staff and hospital facilities are inadequate to manage dengue patients
	
	
	??People seek treatment late and believe in medical myths?
	
?
?
?Traditionally during the months of May, June and July, there is a dengue peak season with the monsoon?
- Dr. Hasitha A. Tissera
?
When asked about the current dengue epidemic in the country, Dr. Hasitha A. Tissera, Consultant Epidemiologist at the Epidemiology Unit of the Ministry of Health, said dengue was globally on the rise and is not just an issue in Sri Lanka. ?There are several countries where cases of dengue have increased and whose numbers are expected to rise over the next couple of months. Vietnam, Thailand and even Singapore have reported an increase in dengue cases due to the prevalent warm weather. The epidemic has also affected India and discussions regarding the issue are being held in Cambodia. An upsurge in the number of dengue patients are expected in these countries. A new trend currently being observed is the gradual spread of dengue to North America and Europe.? ?
One reason Dr. Hasitha gave for the drastic rise of dengue in the country was the change in global weather patterns. The dry humid season which is relatively warmer with unexpected rain spells in between and an erratic monsoon pattern has had an effect on the transmission of diseases through mosquitoes. Dengue is a viral disease. As long as the mosquito responsible- the Aedes mosquito- thrives in the environment, it would result in the spread and transmission of the disease, as their survival is co-related to environmental conditions. He further emphasized that another reason for the increase in dengue patients was due to the migration of people from relatively rural areas to urban areas on a regular basis. ?When non-endemic people migrate to endemic areas, they are exposed to the mosquitoes and thereby transmission increases with more people getting infected in the process.There are four distinct types of dengue infections and multiple types of the virus. So during the transmission of the disease at a given time, a larger group of people get infected due to the co-circulation of these multiple types.? ?
?
?
"People collect water during the dry season for household chores and these containers house breeding dengue mosquitoes"
?
?He also mentioned that the major involvement of other stakeholders other than health and community has been inadequate in order to suppress the condition. ?The media, local government, both public and private institutions and public administrative units each have a role to play and help mobilize and empower people to bear social responsibility to safeguard the community. It should be a continuous exercise. We live in a self-centred community. The environment is equally important when it comes to dengue. Children especially must be educated on the protection of the environment. The more polluted the environment is, the more dengue breeding sites there will be. Construction, urbanization and globalization are other issues we cannot control but if the methods through which they are implemented are properly monitored and regulated, the ill-effects can be minimized.? ?
He said awareness of dengue amongst the public was gradually deteriorating. ?When the death toll from dengue decreases, awareness on the disease also decreases among people. They take it lightly. This is not good.? ?
The spike in the numbers of dengue patients have been astonishing, especially with the dry spell that has been experienced in the country thus far. ?People collect water during the dry season for household chores and these containers house breeding dengue mosquitoes.? Starting from the month of May, the south west monsoons are expected to go on for three months until the end of July. This is considered the period when dengue reaches its peak. Thus, heavy concerns are raised regarding the rise of dengue patients when the monsoon starts. ??
?
?
"Many of these measures were discussed. A three-month continuous programme has been drawn out and it will be in effect from the first of June"
?
Therefore, in order to suppress the epidemic and control the number of dengue victims with the upcoming monsoon season, President Maithripala Sirisena has held a special meeting on May 16 regarding dengue concerns. All stakeholders and the presidential task force were summoned by him to the meeting and the President has directed the relevant authorities to take measures to protect the public. ?Many of these measures were discussed. A three-month continuous programme has been drawn out and it will be in effect from the first of June. Traditionally during the months of May, June and July, there is a dengue peak season with the monsoon. The monsoon season is expected to start at the end of this month. Therefore this is a very timely intervention.? Already 600,000 premises have been inspected with the help of the tri-forces and police carrying out extensive programmes over the last four months. On May 18 and 19, another programme is scheduled to be held in selected high-risk localities according to Dr. Hasitha. ?During these three months we hope to make a sustainable effort. In the health sector, we are making changes in our day-to-day routine in hospitals to develop the capacity to cope with the increasing number of dengue patients. On the preventive side, the President has asked all institutions in the country- both public and private- including schools, railway stations and bus depots, to conduct a regular programme for one hour at least on a weekly basis to clean their surroundings,? he added. Dr. Hasitha sees this as a golden opportunity for the community to make up for their carelessness and take responsibility for the problem. ?
On a final note, as a message to the public, Dr. Hasitha requests the people not to take health matters into their own hands and to seek proper professional medical assistance when the first symptoms of dengue appear. ?

Avoid strenuous activities, seek medical advice in case of a fever
-Dr. Anil Jasinghe
?Deputy Director General of the National Hospital Sri Lanka (NHSL) Dr. Anil Jasinghe, said that currently there were about 100 Dengue patients admitted to NHSL, with about 25 patients who need close monitoring. About 20 new patients are being admitted daily. He said recent initiatives had been taken in the hospital to expand the number of High Dependency Unit beds, which are reserved for patients in the critical stages of dengue, to 60.?
?
He advised the general public to avoid strenuous activities and to seek medical advice in case of a fever, and if hospitalized, to strictly follow the doctor?s advice to drink fluid, because fluid management is a critical part of the treatment of dengue patients
?
"About 100 Dengue patients have been admitted to NHSL, with about 25 patients who need close monitoring. About 20 new patients are being admitted daily"
?
2,211 dengue patients admitted so far
-Dr. Vajira Dissanayake
Deputy Director of the Colombo North (Ragama)Teaching Hospital (CNTH), Dr. Vajira Dissanayake said there were 138 dengue patients in the ward as of midnight on May 14. A total of 2,211 dengue patients have been admitted to the CNTH within this year, with 22 deaths. ? She said wards were overcrowded with more than 90 patients to 40 beds. The nursing staff and minor staff are also severely inadequate, according to Dr. Vajira. ?She stressed on the importance of early diagnosis of the disease, because many deaths from dengue were due to the delay in seeking treatment, with patients only coming to hospital when they were in the critical phase. ?
"Wards were overcrowded with more than 90 patients to 40 beds"
?
Number of patients will increase with rainy season
Dr. Chandana Kendagamuwa
Director (acting), Teaching Hospital Kurunegala, Dr. Chandana Kendagamuwa said that by 7 am on May 15, the number of confirmed dengue patients admitted to the hospital was 188, with 56 suspected cases. The hospital staff is not adequate to manage the heavy patient load, so they are getting help from the army and have requested the Director General of Health Services for more staff from the rural hospitals of the area. Dr. Kendagamuwa added that several hospital staff too had recently contracted dengue, further affecting the shortage of staff. Even though it cannot be confirmed that the staff contracted the disease from within hospital premises, preventive measures are being put in place daily. ?Dr. Kendagamuwa predicts a possible further increase in the number of dengue patients with the beginning of the rainy season, and urges the general public to contribute to the prevention of dengue by destroying possible mosquito breeding sites in their homes and workplaces. ?
"Dr. Kendagamuwa added that several hospital staff too had recently contracted dengue, further affecting the shortage of staff"
?
?50% of dengue patients are from the Western Province?
- Professor Arjuna de Silva
Dengue has risen drastically this year, and it has been the ?main focus of many medical professionals all over the island. Professor ?Arjuna de Silva, Consultant Physician, Teaching Hospital, Ragama also ?expressed his views on the matter. ?The dengue epidemic we are ?facing this year is the largest we have faced so far. Only five months of this year have passed and there are over ?40,000 dengue patients already. ?The current viral trend of dengue type 2 ?is a virulent virus type with more deaths taking place under dengue ?type 2. Fifty percent of dengue patients are from the Western Province. More HDUs (high dependency units) have to be introduced to all ?major hospitals so that more care can be given to patients with serious ?conditions. Preventive measures are of utmost importance. A vaccine ?against dengue is on trial these days. It has to be finalized as soon as ?possible so that we can suppress the rising condition of dengue in the ?country.? The dengue vaccine is anticipated to be finalized by next ?year.
?
?There is a possibility of a large epidemic spreading??
- Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama
The number of dengue patients presently being reported is quite high when compared to earlier, says Consultant Physician of the Infectious Diseases Hospital (IDH) Dr. Ananda Wijewickrama. He commented that with the onset of the monsoon, the possibility of a large epidemic taking place in the country was evident. Noting that the patient intake at the Infectious Diseases Hospital is also on a rapid rise, he said around ninety to a hundred dengue patients were admitted to the hospital on a daily basis. ?There have been a couple of deaths reported owing to dengue fever. The main cause triggering these deaths was the result of patients being admitted to hospital quite late; almost at the last minute. We have advised the public to take a blood test at the end of the second day after developing a fever. However, in the event the fever becomes subdued, some patients tend to avoid getting their blood tested as recommended on the second day but consider getting admitted only when the fever worsens again. Some of these patients were given painkillers while suffering from dengue fever. Other than Paracetamol, any other pill or painkiller should not be administered while a patient is suffering from dengue. Taking such painkillers could cause serious complications in a dengue patient? Dr. Wijewickrama said. ??
?
"?We have advised the public to take a blood test at the end of the second day after developing a fever. However, in the event the fever becomes subdued, some patients tend to avoid getting their blood tested as recommended on the second day"
Noting that the symptoms of dengue fever have not changed overtime, Dr. Wijewickrama stressed that symptoms of dengue fever may include high fever, body aches, headaches and nausea. These are the commonest symptoms. When asked if plasma leakage could indicate a symptom progression in the patient, he explained that plasma leakage is one of the complications that must be detected early in patients. ?There could be changes in the rate and timing of health complications depending on each patient. The main risk factor for the rising trend in the number of dengue patients reported is directly linked to the deadly increase in the number of dengue mosquito breeding grounds evident throughout the country. Due to the high number of dengue patients being admitted to the hospitals, the biggest issue faced by the health sector is how to accommodate all these patients in hospitals. Most hospitals in Colombo including those in Kalubowila, IDH, Homagama, Negombo and Ragama are filled with dengue patients beyond capacity,? he added.?
?
?Type 2 dengue, a more virulent virus plaguing the country?
- Dr. Prachila Samaraweera
Speaking to , Dr. Prachila Samaraweera of the Dengue Control Unit of Colombo provided a better insight to the state of the dengue epidemic that currently exists in the country and the reason for the sudden spike in the number of dengue patients. ??
According to Dr. Prachila, there are four types of dengue viruses, namely types 1,2,3 and 4 and out of the 4, types 1 and 4 have existed in Sri Lanka so far, type 1 being predominant since 2009. Since mid-2016 however, type 2 has also been plaguing the country. This Dr. Prachila says, may be due to migrations. ?The Type 2 dengue virus is a virulent virus compared to types 1 and 4. People infected with type 1 subsequently also get infected with type 2 and ultimately develop the dengue haemorrhagic fever state. For seven years, our country has not been exposed to the type 2 dengue virus, so people do not build up immunity to type 2 easily.? She further reasoned that people did not build up immunity to type 2 as it displayed different symptom patterns when compared with dengue types 1 and 4. ?In dengue types 1 and 4, to reach the severe stage of the disease, it takes a while, with the progression of time. But in type 2, people reach the severe stages in a very short time where the platelet count drops rapidly.? ?
?
?
"The Type 2 dengue virus is a virulent virus compared to types 1 and 4. People infected with type 1 subsequently also get infected with type 2 and ultimately develop the dengue haemorrhagic fever state"
?
When observing the dengue statistics of 2016 and 2017 in comparison, it is not wrong to say that dengue has reached an epidemic state this year. Dr. Prachila said that in 2016, 55,000 dengue patients were reported island wide with a death toll of 97 but when the current year is taken into consideration, for just five months, a number of 44,000 dengue patients were reported from across the island with a death toll of 115. Dr. Prachila also said the highest number of dengue patients were reported from Colombo, which according to her might be due to urbanization. ?
There have been various efforts on the government?s part in their attempts to reduce the spread of dengue in the country. Health campaigns, health inspection visits to houses and other premises to inspect dengue breeding sites, fumigation and pilot dengue vaccination programs are namely some. Despite all of these attempts, dengue has reached an epidemic state. ?Upon admission of a dengue patient to the hospital, the hospital authorities inform the Health Ministry and our health inspectors visit the residential premises of the patients in order to inspect the area for dengue breeding sites.?
There are only 2,000 health inspectors and the public expects our teams to show up and clean the premises to get rid of potential mosquito breeding sites. In other instances, when notified that health inspectors are visiting the locality, only then does the public take an interest in cleaning up their homes. This will not do.
?
?
The public must clean their premises themselves. The Health Ministry cannot be expected to clean each and every potential site for dengue mosquito breeding. To reduce the number of dengue victims, there has to be cooperation and support from the public. When speaking of fumigation, it is only effective on flying mosquitoes at the time of fumigating. It does not affect dengue breeding sites which are the source of the dengue problem,? says Dr. Prachila. ?
When asked whether she felt that awareness levels about dengue had risen among the public, she mentioned that a lack of awareness was not the issue. ?People know about this. They just don?t care. People come to hospitals at the last minute to get treatment. They follow untested myths such as cures through the extracted juice of the papaya leaf, which are of no use whatsoever. If a patient contracts fever, it is now advised to consult a doctor and get a blood count within 24 hours.? She also added that people have to be vigilant for symptoms in order to receive proper medical treatment on time. ? In 2015, there were reports of 30,000 dengue patients with a death toll of 54. Over the years the number of patients have increased along with the death toll. There is a directly proportional increase between the number of deaths and the number of dengue patients. ?When the number of patients decrease, the rate of deaths follow. However when the rate increases, the health sector cannot cope with the number of patients. Each and every patient needs to be individually attended to. When the resources are limited, the death toll rises as facilities will not be helpful.? Dr. Prachila also said that during the special meeting held by the President on May 16 which addressed the dengue issue, he advised on the addition and constructing of new wings to the Kalubowila and Ragama teaching hospitals, with the intention of improving space facilities to accommodate the rising numbers of dengue patients. He also mentioned that schools premises too would have to be kept free of dengue breeding sites with proper maintenance. ?
Dr. Prachila further stresses that in order to reduce the number of dengue patients reported every year and thereby to reduce the death toll, it is of utmost importance to reduce dengue mosquito breeding sites. Dr. Prachila mentioned that the public should be ready to act and support the Health Ministry hand-in-hand in its efforts to reduce the number of people falling victim to the clutches of dengue.
?
Is there a change in dengue symptoms?
In an interview Daily Mirror conducted with Professor Ranjan Premarathne, Faculty of Medicine, University of Kelaniya and Consultant Physician of the North Colombo Teaching Hospital, Prof. Premarathne revealed yet another twist in the Dengue situation.?
He said some recent trends in the disease progression of dengue had been observed, which caused subtle changes in the clinical picture. ?
?No, symptoms have not changed. But we have observed some recent trends in the disease progression when compared to earlier,? said Prof. Premarathne. ?The critical phase of dengue, also called the Leaking Phase, normally occurs after the third day ensuing fever, usually around the fifth or sixth day of the illness. However, there is an increasing number of patients entering the critical phase quite early after developing the fever. Such patients may show signs of going into the leaking phase as early as the third day since developing the fever. This is a condition that is common even in patients whose fever continues for more days than the expected time period. There is also an increase in the number of patients commonly known as ?late leakers?. These patients may suddenly go into the critical phase despite not experiencing fever for a few days? he added. ??
?
Speaking to Daily Mirror, Consultant Paediatrician at the Epidemiology Unit, Dr. Jayantha Weeraman said the subtle changes occurring in the disease progression pattern was due to a change in the dengue virus strain.?
?There are four strains of the dengue virus. The strains frequently seen in the majority of patients in our country were types 1 and 4. However there has been a recent increase in the number of patients being infected with type 2. This will account for the change in the clinical picture of the disease? he said. ??The general public has no cause to be worried, as the symptoms as well as the management plan of the disease remain unchanged. But the need for early hospital admittance should be highlighted even more.? ?
He advises any patient with fever to be cautious and to immediately go for a check-up if they experience any warning signs of dengue, as there is a risk that they may be going into a state of shock. ?Warning signs of dengue are severe abdominal pain, continuous vomiting, drowsiness, restlessness, unusual bleeding like gum bleeding, nose bleeds, vomit the colour of coffee, unusual urinary bleeding or red urine and reduced urine output,? Dr. Weeraman added. ?
Advice to the community
??I?d like to stress that the confirmation test for dengue, called the NS1 antigen test, is only valid if done within the first two days of the fever. If done later than that, the result will be negative even if the patient is having Dengue fever. After three days of fever a full blood count test should be done. It is the responsibility of the primary care doctor to prescribe the relevant test for patients with fever and direct the patient to a hospital if required. Many casualties of dengue could be avoided if these instructions are followed by the community, avoiding unnecessary delay in diagnosis.?
?
?The prevention of dengue in Sri Lanka is the most critical step that needs to be taken. The staff and hospital facilities are severely inadequate in managing the increasing number of patients, due to the heavy patient burden of dengue. With two, sometimes three, patients sharing the same beds in a ward, there is insufficient care given to each patient. As a result, attention given to patients with other illnesses has also dropped drastically. Therefore, it is the duty of the relevant authorities to prevent the spread of dengue by controlling mosquito breeding,? Prof. Premarathne concluded. ?

Lucky and unlucky Numbers
	
?
Numerology ? 1
?
Man?s fascination with certain numbers goes back to the dawn of recorded history. For the Ancient Babylonians the most meaningful number was 60. They based their mathematics and calendar around it ? and we, many centuries later, have inherited their system. That?s why an hour has 60 minutes, and a minute?60 seconds.
?
A hotelier and tour operator, better known as the founder of the Asian-German Sports Exchange Programme (AGSEP) headquartered at Marawila, Dr. Doering is a keen student of?the Occult. ? ?

Significance of 12 and 60
In Ancient Egypt, 12 was considered special. In Egyptian mythology there were 12 realms of the dead. Indeed, 12 crops up throughout history ? inches to a foot, pennies to a shilling, months of the year, the number of apostles. A day is split into two cycles of 12 hours.
There are sensible reasons to venerate 60 and 12. Both divide neatly into halves, quarter and thirds, making them ideal units of currency and measurement. But that doesn?t explain why humans are still so hung up on 7 ? a prime number that cannot neatly be divided by anything other than itself and number 1.
?
Magic Number 7
In our day to day life an emotional attachment to numbers ? and 7 in particular ? is surprisingly common. People around the globe consider 7 as a lucky number, but from where this sentiment originates is most commonly not known, though everyone knows that there are seven days of the week, seven colours of the rainbow, seven notes on a musical scale, seven seas and seven continents. And the common man knows, that Snow White ran off to live with seven dwarves, there were seven brides for seven brothers, Shakespeare described the seven ages of man, Sinbad the Sailor had seven voyages. And when Ian Fleming was looking for a code for James Bond, he didn?t go for 006 or 008. Only 007 had the right ring.
?
But why do we prefer some numbers to others? What is so special about 7?
In the traditional Chinese culture, seven represents the combination of Yin, Yang and Five Elements (Metal, Wood, Water, Fire and Earth). This combination is considered as ?harmony? in the ideology of Confucianism
Hebrew tradition states seven is the number of intelligence, and there are seven Great Holy Days in the Jewish year. Elsewhere, the traditional Menorah, pictured, has seven branches
?
Unlucky 13: why is it feared?
The fear of the number thirteen is called Triskaidekaphobia, a word coined in 1911, and superstitious sufferers associate the number with bad luck and misfortune. In Tarot cards, Death is the thirteenth card in a deck, while the end of the Mayan calendar?s 13th Baktun, or cycle, was said to be the time of the apocalypse in 2012.?
In religion, Judas Iscariot, who betrayed Jesus Christ in the Bible, was the thirteenth member at the?
last supper. Friday the 13th is considered the unluckiest day of the month.
But in Italy, 13 is considered a lucky number, especially when gambling,?
Alex Bellos? poll only asked people for their favourite number. But if it had asked for the number they hate, the answer would inevitably have been 13. The fear of 13 ? or Triskaidekaphobia ? is so widespread that one in ten people thought to suffer from it. ?Many large hotels go straight from the 12th to the 14th floor. No one knows why 13 is thought to be unlucky, but there are many theories. One is that it represents Judas Iscariot, the 13th apostle, who betrayed Jesus at the?
Last Supper.
Another is that it comes from Norse lore, where evil was introduced to the world by the mischievous god Loki at a party in Valhalla, the home of the gods. According to the legend, he was the 13th ?guest to arrive.

But that's exactly what Sri Lanka legend Kumar Sangakkara will do after the Marylebone Cricket Club announced they'll unveil recently-commissioned portraits of him and fellow Test star Mahela Jayawardena on Friday.
The two paintings will go on display in the Lord's Pavilion on the opening day of Middlesex's County Championship match against London-rivals Surrey, for whom Sangakkara is playing his third season for.
They will hang alongside portraits of fellow greats including Glenn McGrath, Shane Warne and Viv Richards at the Home of Cricket.
Both Sangakkara and Jayawardena took part in six separate sittings with the artist, Antony Williams, who has previously been commissioned to paint a portrait of the Queen.
The Sri Lankan pair are both depicted in casual attire by their own choice.
"I was humbled when I was asked to sit for the portrait commissioned by MCC," Sangakkara said in a Marylebone Cricket Club statement. "It is a great honour to be on the walls (at Lord's).
"I wanted to know how I would be represented through Antony's eyes; not just my expressions or my physical appearance but how he would interpret me as a whole.
"Having seen the final portrait, I was so very pleasantly surprised, unnerved and a bit embarrassed seeing myself in a frame on canvas but thoroughly happy with the work done."
Jayawardena, who is currently in India fulfilling coaching duties with Indian Premier League outfit Mumbai Indians, won't be present for the launch.
However the former Sri Lanka captain may have the chance to take a closer look at his portrait later this year when he arrives in the United Kingdom to play for Lancashire in England's domestic T20 competition.
MCC curator of collections Adam Chadwick said Jayawardena and Sangakkara were taking their rightful place next to some of the game's finest players.
"MCC regularly commissions portraits of players who have captivated a generation of cricket fans in all forms of the game, all around the world, and both Kumar and Mahela fit the bill perfectly," Chadwick said.
"I am delighted with these additions to the MCC Collection and am sure that they will be enjoyed by visitors to Lord's for years to come."
The four-day match between Sangakkara's Surrey, who sit top of the Division One table, and hosts Middlesex, captained by former Australia batsman Adam Voges, gets underway on Friday evening AEST. (cricket.com.au)

Putin, Macron discuss boosting ties in first call: Kremlin
	
?
MOSCOW AFP May18, 2017-Russian President Vladimir Putin and new French leader Emmanuel Macron discussed boosting poor ties between Paris and Moscow in their first phone conversation, the Kremlin said Thursday. ??
The two leaders expressed ?the mutual readiness to develop the traditionally friendly Russian-French relations in the political, trade, economic, cultural, humanitarian and other spheres,? the Kremlin said in a statement. ??
The statement said the presidents agreed to ?jointly work on current international and regional issues, including the fight against terrorism.? Putin and Macron also stressed the importance of further cooperation to end the three-year war in eastern Ukraine, with France playing a key role alongside Germany as a mediator. ??
After Macron?s election earlier this month, Putin urged him to bridge deep rifts and work together in the face of the ?growing threat of terrorism and violent extremism?. ??
The Kremlin was widely seen as backing Macron?s far-right opponent Marine Le Penn. ?

Rains wreak havoc in Colombo
	
Vehicular traffic in Colombo, its suburbs and the southern parts of the country, came to a standstill for several hours last afternoon as torrential rains and strong winds flooded roads with fallen trees blocking some of them.
The rains lashed Colombo, Kalutara, Galle districts and several parts of the Western Province as a result of active cloud cover and convergence of winds in the west of Sri Lanka.
The Meteorology Department said the active cloud cover was an intermediate condition of the upcoming South West Monsoonal season and the Inter Monsoonal season.
Most of the areas in the City including Horton Place, Borella, Pettah, Dematagoda, Thunmulla, Kirillapone and Nugegoda, were under water.
Colombo had a rainfall of 88.9 mm resulting in the roads chock 'o block with traffic.
Trees had fallen near the Telecom Head Office in Fort, the Fire Brigade Headquarters at Darley Road in Maradana, Tractor Cooperation Junction in Pettah, the road behind the BMICH and opposite the National Museum in Colombo.
Heavy traffic was reported along the Baseline Road because of the road being blocked by a container truck that had toppled over near the Kelanitissa Power Station.
The Vesak pandal erected at the Kiribathgoda Town had also collapsed damaging four vehicles. In Maharagama, the police taken steps to remove the vehicles parked near the Maharagama pandal and asked the people to move away from the vicinity of the pandal as there was a possibility of it collapsing because of the strong winds.
Duty Meteorologist Nimal Bandara said heavy rains should occur in several districts including Ratnapura and Galle on at least three consecutive days for the department to announce the arrival of the South West Monsoon.
He said heavy rains or thunder showers of more than 100 mm could occur in the southern parts of the country including the Western, North-Western, Central, Sabaragamuwa and Southern Provinces.
Mr. Bandara however said drought-affected areas had not been received sufficient rain yesterday.
In the weather forecast issued for the next 36 hours, the department said fairly strong winds at times could be expected over the island especially in the western slope of the central hills and strong winds at times in the surrounding seas of up to 60-70 kmph. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Rupee ends steady after paring early gains
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended steady yesterday, erasing gains from earlier in the day on investor concerns that the currency would fall after the Central Bank set a target for buying dollars directly from the market in a bid to boost reserves.
Rupee forwards were active, with spot-next forwards closing steady at 152.85/90 per dollar. One-week forwards also were steady at the close of trade, at 152.95/153.00 per dollar.
Sri Lanka?s Central Bank is targeting US$1.2 billion in direct market purchases of dollars to boost the island nation?s reserves this year, said Indrajit Coomaraswamy, the monetary authority?s chief yesterday.
That comes after Sri Lanka missed its end-December reserves target agreed with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) for a US$1.5 billion, 36-month loan.
?The move will definitely put pressure on the rupee at a time when the central bank is not defending it and the market is determining the exchange rate,? a currency dealer said asking not to be named.
The spot rupee did not trade yesterday.
The Central Bank fixed the spot rupee reference rate at 152.50 on May 5.
The Central Bank has allowed the currency to gradually depreciate since mid-December, revising its spot reference rate multiple times.

Snowden lashes out at HK for rejecting SL, Filipino refugees
	
Fugitive whistleblower Edward Snowden hit back at the Hong Kong government on Thursday for rejecting the protection bids of a group of refugees including Sri Lankans who sheltered him while he was hiding out in the city, the AFP reported.
The impoverished Philippine and Sri Lankan refugees helped the former US National Security Agency contractor evade authorities in 2013 by hiding him in their cramped homes after he initiated one of the largest data leaks in US history.
They have spent years hoping the Hong Kong government would recognise their cases and save them from being sent back to their home countries where they say they were persecuted.
But the family of four, a mother and her daughter and a single man saw their protection claims rejected Monday by the city?s immigration authorities, which said there were ?no substantial grounds? for believing they would be at risk if they went home. They now face deportation.
?These are good people that were driven from their homes by torture, rape, abuse, blackmail and war, circumstances that are really difficult for us to imagine,? Snowden said in a video released Thursday.
?Now what they?re facing is a transparent injustice from the very people that they asked to protect them,? he said.
?Someone in the Hong Kong government has decided that they want to make these families disappear immediately, no matter the cost,? Snowden added in the video.
He has been living in exile in Russia since the summer of 2013. Russia?s immigration service in January extended Snowden?s residency permit to 2020.
The refugees? lawyer, Robert Tibbo has called the decision by Hong Kong authorities ?completely unreasonable?, and said he had less than two weeks to submit appeals before the families were deported.
He said there was a risk his clients could be detained and their children placed in government custody.
Hong Kong is not a signatory to the UN?s refugee convention and does not grant asylum.
However, it is bound by the UN Convention against Torture and Other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment (UNCAT) and considers claims for protection based on those grounds.
One of the refugees, Vanessa Rodel from the Philippines, who lives in Hong Kong with her five-year-old daughter, broke down over the news of the decision.
Another of the refugees, Ajith Pushpakumara from Sri Lanka, told AFP the government had ?taken his whole life?.
Lawyers for the Snowden refugees have separately lodged an asylum petition with the Canadian government and are calling for to be expedited.

The town mouse and the country mouse
	
The polity of this country, before and after 1948, was governed by two broad movements. The first comprised of the moderates, i.e. those who believed in the status quo as a means of uplifting the nation. The second comprised of extremists or rather individuals termed as extremists, i.e. those who believed in attaining independence through self-sufficiency. Much of our post-independence, post-colonial history can be summed up in terms of the clash between these two. ?
When Gunadasa Amarasekara let go of his flirtation with literary modernism and became the intellectual ballast of the Jathika Chinthanaya with Nalin de Silva, the Soviet Union was breaking apart. We were promised a more inclusive world, or as Francis Fukuyama envisaged it, the end of history. History of course doesn?t end, however, not that easily anyway, and so the end of Communism didn?t spell out anything new or different: rather, the left and the right became no more than political constructs, both of which were part of the Western modernist discourse on development, knowledge, economics, what-not. ?
Between Amarasekara and de Silva, the latter was more political (Amarasekara once described him in an interview as our first real postmodernist). He and to a considerable extent the ideology his movement disseminated believed in the objectives conceived almost a century earlier by Anagarika Dharmapala. ?
?
?
I believe it was Malinda Seneviratne who claimed (I don?t remember when or where) that the likes of de Silva were critiqued by even those who liked to consider themselves as nationalists. This is true. De Silva himself noted that such nationalists would think twice about considering him as one of them. It is from that premise that he and Amarasekara drew a distinction between two kinds of Buddhism: Sinhala and Olcott. The first was followed by the extremists, the second by the gradualists. Such a distinction is vital when evaluating the history of Buddhism in the country. ?Nationalism has always been up for grabs. It has created, bifurcated, splintered, and often killed off political movements. It has also become so fluid that it resists categorisation. For me, the primary issue of the 21st century has been the conflict between individuality and nationhood, a variant of the conflict between nationalism and internationalism. The distinction pointed out above, therefore, can be rooted in the dichotomy between experiencing a faith as an individual (Olcott Buddhism) and experiencing it as a collective (Sinhala Buddhism). ?
That is why Olcott Buddhism is considered by the likes of Nalin as an extension of Lutheranism and Calvinism: it substituted individual salvation for collective repentance. However, it was also an internationalised variation of an anti-internationalist creed, the kind which subsisted on both rationality and mysticism. What it did was to divide Sinhala from Buddhism, history from faith, and faith from the social and the political. This division explains the debate between those who profess a separation of temple and state and those who do not. ?
?
?
And there the comparison between Lutheranism/Catholicism and Olcott Buddhism/Sinhala Buddhism ends. Lutheranism was by large an extension of the creeds contained in Catholicism. Olcott Buddhism, on the other hand, was never an extension of Sinhala Buddhism. The latter two viewed religion in manifestly different ways: for the Sinhala Buddhist, engagement with culture could condone even members of the clergy who joined the Army, whereas for the Olcott Buddhist, what mattered was the individual?s engagement with his or her faith. ?
George D. Bond?s account of the Buddhist movement in Sri Lanka (?The Buddhist Revival in Sri Lanka?), from the revival to the setting up of lay Buddhist organisations after independence, echoes this distinction between the collective and the individual. He points at two eminent Western scholars, William Ames and Heinz Bechert, both of whom differentiated between two kinds of Buddhists: the former between those who wished to retain privileges in the upcountry and those who were emerging as local capitalists in the low country, and the latter between the traditionalists and the modernists. Agreeing with both, Bond brings up another mode of distinction: between the reformists and the neo-traditionalists. From what I have read so far, this distinction is the closest to an equivalent from a Western scholar we have of the Jathika Chinthanaya?s classification of Sinhala and Olcott Buddhists. ?
?
"Between Amarasekara and de Silva, the latter was more political (Amarasekara once described him in an interview as our first real postmodernist). He and to a considerable extent the ideology his movement disseminated believed in the objectives conceived almost a century earlier by Anagarika Dharmapala"
?
According to Bond, the reformists were the militant nationalists, who followed Dharmapala in his attempt to resuscitate both religion and collective. The neo-traditionalists, by contrast, repudiated the methods set by Dharmapala in achieving his ideals while affirming the substance of those ideals. This concomitant rejection and acceptance of a man considered as a chauvinist by the ?other side? explains the at times schizophrenic outlook on Buddhism propagated by the neo-traditionalists. ?
That schizophrenic outlook found its pivot in the distinction between the religious and the secular. For these Buddhists, the ultimate goal of this life was threefold: observe sil, support one?s family by right livelihood, and ?do good? in the world [Bond, p 65]. Of these, Bond points out, the second was influenced by the Protestant ethic of closer familial bonds, the same bonds that Buddhism sought to do away with. ?
It speaks volumes about how detached this was from the people that no less a figure than D. B. Jayatilaka contrasted in an article titled ?Practical Buddhism? between two modes of living: the household and the clergy. These Buddhists advocated, not the ?this-world? asceticism preached by Dharmapala, but an ?other-world? asceticism in which the primary goal of one?s present life was to wallow in a materialistic variant of one?s faith through the ?pansakulaya, malwatti, and upparawatti? (as de Silva once memorably observed). The clergy had no relevance for the household, in other words. ?So much for the neo-traditionalists. Of their intellectual descendants, the Olcott Buddhists, I believe Nalin de Silva said it best: ?They have separated Buddhism from culture and profession.? What de Silva meant was the Olcott Buddhist secularised a faith that was at the outset against secularism. In other words, it was as culturally castrated as the colonialism it tried to combat, a point that de Silva and Amarasekara gleaned only too well when they contended that the motive of Colonel Olcott and the theosophists was to equal, if not better, the missionary school. ?
?
?
This fixation with bettering the missionary school and those other colonialist institutions appealed, not to the rural simpleton, but to the urban layman, who continues to make the waves as a refined wielder of the faith. Such wielders were at best cut off from the sensibilities of the Sinhala people, for whom Buddhism remained more than just a religion (and was actually a way of life and of seeing). It is these same wielders, incidentally, who prefer to be known as nationalists and yet find it uncomfortable to be ranked alongside the likes of de Silva and Amarasekara. ?
Inasmuch as Nalin de Silva and Gunadasa Amarasekara made it their life?s work to disprove Western modernism, their efforts become more relevant today because of the distinction they made between those two kinds of Buddhists. I say this not because I wish to belittle their work on Western philosophy and science ? being hardly conversant in either, I can only conjecture as to what they accomplished there ? but rather because much of the responsibility for that ill-defined variant of Buddhism, with its artificial division between the temple and the home, can be laid down by the feet of those adherents who paid obeisance to the gods while proclaiming, ?Siddhartha Gautama did not encourage us to fight wars against terrorists!? That Amarasekara and de Silva helped us discern this fatal contradiction, I believe, speaks a lot about who the rooted adherents of the faith are and who are not. ?

?This is the single greatest witch hunt?
	
President Trump railed against his Justice Department?s decision to appoint a special counsel to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 campaign. ??
?With all the illegal acts that took place in the Clinton campaign & Obama Administration, there was never a special councel appointed!? the president wrote first thing Thursday morning, misspelling ?counsel.? ??
Trump followed that up with: ?This is the single greatest witch hunt of a politician in American history!? ??
Former FBI Director Robert Mueller, who served a decade and was then reappointed by President Obama, will take over the executive branch investigation. The Justice Department announced that Mueller would serve as special counsel, and would have ?all appropriate resources? to carry out the probe ? during a week when Donald Trump?s White House was battered by disclosures about his contacts with the Russians and his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. ?The White House has spent weeks batting back efforts to install an independent outsider to lead the Russia probe, saying there are already sufficient probes. As Special Counsel, Mueller will have a wide berth to follow the investigation where he sees fit, and set his own terms for how much information he wants to reveal or withhold. ??
It wasn?t immediately clear how or whether Trump?s contacts with Comey and reported efforts to either steer or inquire about the FBI?s Russia probes played a role in the decision.?

THE HAGUE AFP May18, 2017-The UN?s top court on Thursday ordered Pakistan to stay the execution of an Indian national convicted of spying, in a decision hailed by New Delhi. ??
Judges at the International Court of Justice (ICJ) ruled in a unanimous and binding decision that Kulbhushan Sudhir Jadhav must not be put to death by Islamabad until they have had time to pass final judgement in the case. ??
Jadhav was arrested in the restive southwestern Pakistani province of Balochistan in March 2016 and Pakistani officials claim he has confessed to spying for Indian intelligence services. He was convicted last month by a military court and sentenced to death. ??
??Pakistan shall take all measures at its disposal to ensure that Mr Jadhav is not executed pending the final decision in these proceedings,? said the court?s president Ronny Abraham. ? ?Court ordered Pakistan to inform the tribunal that it has implemented the decision, and stressed ICJ decisions are binding on all member states.?
