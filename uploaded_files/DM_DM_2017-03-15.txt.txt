Advise Mangala to safeguard country's integrity: JO to President
	
The Joint Opposition today made a request to President Maithripala Sirisena to advise Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera to safeguard the countrys freedom, integrity and the Constitution while dealing with the Geneva Proposals.
Joint Opposition Leader MP Dinesh Gunawardena told a news briefing that it was the governments responsibility to work on the proposals which were in favour of our country rather than continuing with the ones which were against it.
Several people mocked at us when we have once said the hybrid courts are not feasible in Sri Lanka. After several months the President and Prime Minister have also agreed to the same fact, he said.
However, he said the discussions have being held in Geneva, requesting for more time to continue with the Geneva Proposals by Sri Lanka
Meanwhile, the JO condemned the suppression on the university students who were protesting against the South Asian Institute of Technology and Medicine (SAITM) in Malabe by the government.
The conditions have worsened at present regarding the SAITM issue in comparison to the controversy which has taken place in establishing the North Colombo Medical College, the first privately funded medical school in the country, he said.
He also urged the President to arrive to a decision on the issue immediately in a justified manner without taking wrong steps.
Joint Opposition MP Dullas Alahapperuma said they would launch a country-wide protest campaign starting from March 18 against the governments continuous postponing of Local Government election; As the initial step we will launch a protest campaign in Ratnapura, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

An innocuous gesture that sent him into a panic!
	

A group of purohitas were taking an upward ride in the Diyawanna council elevator the other day. And a young purohita from Rajarata holding a high post in the Blue party and a colleague from Puttalam area whose name is being mentioned often in connection with Vilpattu national park were seen engrossed in a conversation during the ride.

The purohita from Puttalam suddenly grasped the hand of his young colleague from Rajarata as if in an effort to command his undivided attention to what he was saying in all earnestness.
However, the young colleagues reaction to this seemingly unconscious gesture was something unexpected. The young purohita immediately withdrew his hand with a jerk and addressed the Puttalam colleague with a chuckle. I am all ears to what you are saying. But for Gods sake please let go of my hand!
The other purohitas inside the elevator cage witnessing the scene threw quizzical glances at their colleague from Rajarata and the latter said by way of an explanation: Apoi! I get frightened when he catches hold of my hand!
Why on earth does such an innocuous gesture send you into a fright the others asked in amazement.
The reason is something you have to find out for yourselves! said the Rajarata purohita with a loud guffaw as he stepped out of the lift that came to a halt.
The inquisitive purohitas are yet to find the cause behind the Rajarata colleagues fright, they say.

BASL polls today
	
The Bar Association of Sri Lanka (BASL), the premier body of the lawyers in Sri Lanka, will conduct elections for its new office bearers including its president today.
BASL's outgoing president Geffery Alagaratnam told Daily Mirror that there would be a three-cornered battle for the presidency this year, as three leading lawyers -- Anura Meddegoda, U. R. L. Perera and R. Thangarajah will contest for the post.
He said there would be around 8,000 votes, while other sources said the total number of voters could be as high as 14,000. He said the polls would be held in the districts where the BASL has branches. The results are expected to be out at around 6.30 pm.
Both U. R. L. Perera and Anura Meddegoda were engaged in a strong SMS campaign last evening. Mr Pereras campaign said Vote for U R L Perera so that I can bring about the change you want", while the SMS campaign of Anura Meddegoda said I stand up against the infringement of Bar Association Members and safeguard the dignity of our profession.
BASL elections have become an event which has been focused upon by the lawyers themselves, in political circles and in civil society. Some candidates have been backed by political parties, and there have been instances where party members have contested for the presidency in the past. (Yohan Perera)

Brexit set to begin  as bill enters  final stages
	

British Prime Minister Theresa May is expected to trigger Brexit this week by formally notifying the European Union of Britains intention to leave the bloc, sending her country into uncharted waters. 
The legislation empowering May to put Britain on a course that no EU member state has ever taken returns to parliament for its final stages on Monday as European capitals prepare for mammoth negotiations. 
The prime minister promised months ago to invoke Article 50 of the EUs Lisbon Treaty, starting the two-year withdrawal process, by the end of March. 

Last week she expressed her impatience, telling reporters at a Brussels summit: Our European partners have made clear to me that they want to get on with the negotiations, and so do I. Once May has notified the EU of her decision by letter, the other 27 EU leaders will take some 48 hours to issue their first draft proposal for the negotiations, but talks are not actually expected to begin for months as both sidesfinalise strategies. 
May was forced to introduce the two-clause bill empowering her to trigger Article 50 after the Supreme Court ruled in January that she must seek parliaments approval to
start Brexit. 
The bill was held up earlier this month by amendments passed in the unelected House of Lords, demanding guarantees for EU nationals rights and a parliamentary vote on the final withdrawal deal. 
MPs in the elected lower House of Commons, where May has a majority, overwhelmingly supported the bill in its first stage last month.
Ministers are hopeful the Commons will overturn the Lords amendments in a vote on Monday, although some europhile Conservative MPs may rebel. 
The bill would then return to the Lords later that evening for final approval, where further opposition is possible, but unlikely. Adding to the day of drama, anti-austerity and pro-immigration campaigners are set to protest outside parliament later on Monday to urge MPs to guarantee the status of the three million EU nationals living in Britain. 
A majority in Scotland voted for Britain to stay in the EU, but across the whole kingdom 52 percent voted to leave.

Close the door on politicos!
	

The countrys national body governing the gentlemens game has been a hotbed of power struggles over the years and several issues that had been simmering for some time in the recent past are about to trigger an explosive situation, they say.

Certain issues brewing for years took a back seat when the two main rivals closed ranks to put an end to the sway held by a willow-wielding family over the national game.
However, the intolerant and overbearing attitude of the one who took over the reins has led to the imminent explosive situation, informed sources say.
Three outstanding characters associated with the game have now dug in for a pitched battle to oust the incumbent head and put back in the seat a seasoned player from a new world (though not new to the game), who has always been keen on starting a fresh innings.
Meanwhile, independent high-ups involved in looking after the game at national level are unanimous in the opinion that closing the door on politicos is the only way to dispel for good Saturns malefic aspect over the game.

Cupidity and serendipity for a change!
	

The other day, several young Diyawanna members from the two main political strands were engaged in a gossip session in the council lobby. They were swapping banter and laughing merrily when a senior purohita walked past them.

Meanwhile, a talkative one from the Colombo district winked at the passing purohita and muttered with a mischievous smile: A lucky one!
Intrigued by this cryptic remark, the others turned to him with a quizzical look.
Now that the passerby- purohita had disappeared, the Diyawanna member who made the remark, incidentally one from Kalutara area, explained: He is one of the two cupids in the same age bracket who never miss a chance to make a pass at a cutie they happen to come across!
What do you know about the exploits of our cupids well past their sixties another member challenged. There are two old guys, who would affectionately hold the hand of a young female, meeting even for the first time . He suddenly stopped talking on seeing one old cupid referred to earlier sauntering in their direction.

EU court rejects argument that LTTE didnt engage in 'terrorist acts'
	
The European Court of Justice (ECJ) on Tuesday has rejected an argument by the LTTE requesting that their activities not be classified as "terrorist acts."
According to an article published on JURISTs website, the arguments were proffered as support for four individuals who had their assets frozen due to the accusation that they were financing acts of terror by financing the Tamil Tigers.
The court ruled the move was acceptable, holding that the acts of the Tamil Tigers were admissible as terrorist acts.
Terror Lists have come under fire in recent years for violating the basic human rights of those affected by the blacklisting.
Meanwhile, the New Zealand Herald reported that four people in the Netherlands had their assets frozen. It was argued the group's activities, as an armed force in a civil war, were governed by international humanitarian law and not international anti-terrorism rules.
The court found international law "does not prevent actions by armed forces during periods of armed conflict from constituting 'terrorist acts.'"
Last year ECJ Advocate General Eleanor Sharpston released two opinions arguing that Hamas and the LTTE should be removed from the EU's Terror List.

EU, SL exchange information on ongoing reforms
	
A detailed exchange of information had taken place between Sri Lanka and the European Union (EU) on many important ongoing reforms, inclusive of the Constitution-making, a joint press release issued yesterday said.
The release was issued following a meeting of the working group on Governance, Rule of Law and Human Rights, under the European Union-Sri Lanka Joint Commission which was held on Monday and Tuesday.
There was a detailed exchange of information on many important ongoing reforms, such as Constitution-making, as well as replacing the Prevention of Terrorism Act and amending the Code of Criminal Procedure Act to bring them in line with international standards, the statement said.
Both sides had recognised the need for further progress on reconciliation and agreed that the full implementation of the UNHRC resolution remains a priority.
The EU had recognised the progress made by Sri Lanka in various areas, including the ratification of the Convention for the Protection of All Persons from Enforced Disappearance and on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, the passing of the Right to Information Act and legislation on the Office on Missing Persons.
There was also discussion of the progress made and the challenges ahead in maintaining the freedoms of expression and of the media, strengthening civil society, advancing the rights of women and children, respecting non-discrimination on any grounds, addressing the rights of minorities, acceleration of the return of land, labour rights, and implemention of the treaty obligations and the rule of law.
The parties also discussed Sri Lanka's application under the EU's Generalised Scheme of Preferences Plus (GSP+), which is currently under consideration by the European Parliament and the Council.
The two institutions have until mid-May to discuss the European Commissions assessment and adopt their position.
Therefore, the EU drew attention to the importance of Sri Lanka making prompt and concrete progress in fulfilling international commitments on human rights and labour rights and environmental protection, the statement said.
The conclusions and recommendations of the Working Group will be reported to the EU-Sri Lanka Joint Commission to be held later this year. The Joint Commission will then assess the progress achieved since todays meeting.
The EU delegation to the Working Group also called on Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and Foreign Affairs Minister Mangala Samaraweera. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

Govt. members walking out of house: Not to protest against Speaker: Gayantha
	
Some government MPs went out of the house during parliament proceedings recently was not in protest of the Speaker but to discuss about the continuous interruption by the Joint Opposition MPs in parliament proceedings, the Co-cabinet Spokesman and Media Minister Gayantha Karunatilleke said today.
We did not walk out of the house. We just went out to discuss about the situation that had arisen in the house due to the continuous interruption by the Joint Opposition MPs, he said.
Minister Karunathilaka said an organised group had been spreading rumours targeting the Speaker to inconvenience him.
He told the weekly Cabinet briefing that a certain group in parliament was interrupting parliament proceedings and wasting time and money of the people, which was a serious matter.
No one who value parliamentary democracy would act like this. This group interrupted parliament proceedings several times. But the Speaker only acted democratically, he said.
When asked whether the government MPs had proposed that the Speaker should be removed, Minister Karunathilaka said there had been no such proposal and added that there was no such need.
Minister Karunathilaka said it was proved that the Joint Opposition group even did not have the support of their members and its leaders.
Deputy Minister Sujeewa Senasinghe said there were some occasions where they could not agree on the Speakers decisions but they never interrupted him or protested other than respecting his decisions. (Ajith Siriwardana)

He is no pushover!
	

There is a powerful purohita who is widely believed to be the most likely one to lose his portfolio at the reshuffle said to be round the corner.

This purohita has, as a token of his goodwill, distributed five super vehicles taken on rent by the Ministry to some Diyawanna members loyal to him. The rental for these vehicles alone costs the Ministry over Rs. 1 million a month.
The white collar high-up responsible for authorizing the monthly rental  for the five vehicles, being a once bitten, twice shy one had checked whether there was the necessary Cabinet sanction to make this payment. Finding that there was such sanction, he refused to okay the payment.
Despite the purohita ordering him several times to authorize the rental payment, the white collar one had firmly stood his ground. In fact, the man had already learnt a bitter lesson from being confined to the state-run lodge for a brief spell on account of a similar offence committed by a colleague.
Finding that the rental for the fiver vehicles had fallen into arrears for five months, the rent- a- car dealer livid with anger had slammed the white collar one concerned holding out the threat to send him home if he failed to authorize the payment without further delay. He had told the white collar one: Your predecessor tried to be funny with me and I sent him home. Remember you too are going to suffer the same fate!
However, the white collar high-up who kept his cool had told him calmly: Ah! Are you the person responsible for sending people like us home Okay. Send me home if you can. But you can rest assured I will not authorize this rental payment come hell or high water!

Several parties from within yahapalanaya had reportedly put spokes in the wheel of the Sino-Lanka deal on the Magampura port and the purohita in charge of the subject of ports was one of them, they say.

So the authorities in the highest echelons had decided to move this purohita out of this portfolio.
Upon hearing about the move afoot to remove him from his current portfolio, the highly disconcerted purohita had met Number One to ascertain from the horses mouth itself what was in store for him. He also had apprised the boss of the legal opinion made available to him that the proposed deal would not be legally valid if it were put through without suitably amending the relevant Act. 
The purohita had also explained to Number One the repercussions that could result from resorting to amending the existing Act. Later the purohita had received instructions from above not to take any action designed to amend the Act in question. Highly elated over these latest instructions, the purohita is said to be chanting in a refrain: I have no fear now! I have no fear now!

There is a key institution which is instrumental in bringing precious forex to the country. It is headed by a person who played an active role in bringing yahapalanaya to power. This institution comes under the purview of a Green party purohita.

The head of this institution and the purohita are at loggerheads and the latter decided to have the defiant one replaced by a political buddy of his before their strained relations took a turn for the worse. The best way to get rid of him, he thought, was offering him an attractive alternative office like an ambassadorial post.
Later the purohita presented his proposition to both Number One and Number Two in yahapalanaya. Having obtained their approval, he conveyed it to the head of the institution through a third party.
However, the institution head had turned down the idea straightaway, they say. And the purohita now back at zero one is said to be contemplating his next move.

Helping your child develop self-confidence
	

Q How can parents encourage their children to develop self-confidence and engage in healthy social relationships, especially in the context of children, including young adults who are inclined towards introversion 
What we describe as our personality or its precursor, our temperament, is determined even before we are born, through our genetic make-up. However, our interactions with the environment play a major role in how these characteristics develop. Thus, both nature and nurture appear to be important in determining who we become. 
For a child, a major portion of these social interactions will be with their parents. Decades of research has shown that children who have a secure attachment tend to be more confident in who they are and in their interactions with others. 
When parents are responsive to their children when they are in distress and in need of comforting, protection and dealing with their feelings, a child feels secure. If the parents themselves are unable to control and deal with their own feelings, they become reactive and may respond according to their own needs instead of the childrens. Thus, controlling our emotions as parents and being aware of our own emotions is extremely important. 
Understanding the cues of the child and knowing what the child really needs is also imperative. For instance, protecting a child when he or she wants to explore something or is being deliberately naughty will not be helpful. Watching anxiously over a child is not likely to give the child a sense of security or confidence! 
This theory also suggests that whenever possible, we as parents should follow the childs lead. We should not only be responsive to the child when necessary but take charge, so that the child does not have to take charge of situations by himself or herself. Both aspects are needed for a child to feel secure. 
When a child feels secure, the part of their brains involved in social and emotional development benefits in the best possible way. These templates of our early interactions become the foundation of how we interact with others. Children with such experiences learn to be responsive and empathetic towards others in a healthy way. 
For older children, being given plenty of opportunities to interact socially is needed. Parents displaying the same social qualities they want their children to have is also important. After all, many parents will have experienced how children pick up on how they respond to situations and start responding the same way! 
Children can also be affected by setbacks in relationships like losing a best friend, being bullied by peers, or in the case of older adolescents, romantic relationships. Here again, having a supportive network of friends and family to fall back on is helpful. This can help children survive and also thrive, rather than developing a sense of being a victim in social situations. 
Again, as the child grows older, the influence of peers increases.
They are also exposed to more complicated social problems. A parent being able to talk to and help their children work through these complex problems is important to their social development. Thus, having the skills to disentangle oneself from a peer group engaging in bad behaviour and knowing how to do this without being a victim or hurting the feelings of others is as important as being able to solve a complicated mathematical issue!

The elder sibling of the former strongman created ripples of resentment in JO camp when he attended a function organized on the initiative of Number One in yahapalanaya recently.

However, none of the JO stalwarts at the time were bold enough to question the conduct of the revered elder of the once powerful family. The matter appeared forgotten with the passage of time.
The issue that ruffled the JO front-liners surfaced again when the former strongmans loyal namesake from Matara queried about it from the politically more aggressive sibling at the grand party hosted by the gabby bold one from Kalutara although the revered elder himself was present on the occasion.
The politically aggressive sibling replied: We dont question the actions of our eldest one. You may call it a family tradition However, you being senior to him as a council member could have explained to him the misconceptions and misgivings such an action could create among the people in the country.
Thats quite true, said the Matara stalwart. Just see the way these guys now in power messing up things! We may rather  than become the bedfellows of these guys! (Our apologies to the readers for the blank for the words were unprintable)

The Joint Opposition (JO), yesterday, accused the government of endorsing the alienation of 18 state business institutions to obtain US$ 5.8 billion.
It said Waters Edge, the Grand Oriental Hotel, Litro Gas, Lanka Hospitals, the Hyatt Regency Complex, Hilton Hotel, Hambantota Airport and the Port were among the 18 institutions identified by the Pathfinder Foundation as potential candidates to lure Foreign Direct Investments.
Alienation is not a practice of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party (SLFP) or the United National Peoples Alliance (UPFA). We cannot countenance the sale of state entities that would place the fate of future generation at risk, MP Bandula Gunawardena said at a media briefing.
He said there were some SLFP ministers in the government who were against the alienation of state institutions.
Ports and Shipping Minister Arjuna Ranatunga said recently that he was against the Hambantota Port deal on account of some unacceptable conditions. We commend Minister Ranatunga for not giving into peer pressure, he said. (Lahiru Pothmulla)

The extension of the Central Expressway up to Dambulla had been put on hold because of a decision by the Government to stop external borrowings for any project hereafter, it is learnt.
The Cabinet Committee on Economic Management has taken this decision a week ago.
Accordingly, the Government has also shelved the implementation of the Ruwanpura Expressway project. A government source told the Daily Mirror that the Government would opt for projects on the Build, Operate and Transfer (BOT) model only.
The source said this was a temporary move taken to tide over the crisis involving debt servicing at the moment.
Once we come out of it, we can opt for development loans, the source said.
However, the source said that the Government would proceed with the construction of the Central Expressway linking Colombo with Kandy via Kurunegala. (Kelum Bandara)

Major winter storm barreling toward Northeast US, 4,000 flights canceled
	

By Mark Berman 
(c) 2017, The Washington Post  
Mar 14, 2017 -
Preparations continued Monday across the Northeast for the arrival of what forecasters say will be the first major winter storm of the season, bringing with it dire warnings of blizzard conditions in New Jersey, New York and Connecticut. 
School systems announced closures, airlines canceled waves of flights and officials across the Mid-Atlantic and New England urged people to stay off the roads in the face of a possibly massive storm. 
According to the Capital Weather Gang, at least a foot of snow is in the forecast from Philadelphia to Maine, a packed swath of the country encompassing millions of people, miles of highly trafficked roadways and some of the countrys busiest airports. 
Forecasts called for as much as two feet of snow in New York City, which is under a blizzard warning through midnight on Tuesday, according to the National
Weather Service. 
Falling and blowing snow with strong winds and poor visibilities are likely, the service said in a warning Monday morning. This will lead to whiteout conditions . . . making travel extremely dangerous. Do not travel. If you must travel . . . have a winter survival kit with you. In New York City, where forecasts call for as much as 4 inches of snowfall per hour on Tuesday, officials issued a hazardous travel advisory and urged people to stick with mass transit. 
Were preparing for a significant storm on Tuesday, and New Yorkers should also prepare for snow and dangerous road conditions, Mayor Bill de Blasio, D, said in a statement. 
All public schools in New York City were going to be closed Tuesday, the citys Department of Education said. Authorities sent 689 salt spreaders across the city, and when the snow accumulation tops two inches, more than 1,600 plows will be deployed, according to the New York City Emergency Management Department. 
New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, D, said he plans to activate the states emergency operations center on Monday night and will send out extra state police patrols during the storm. His office also warned that the Metropolitan Transportation Authority, which operates the subways in New York City, could limit or cancel rail service entirely, depending on how severe the storm is.
Airlines were already preparing for the snowfall, scrapping planned flights as well as fees for travelers who need to book new tickets. More than 4,000 flights scheduled for Tuesday had been cancelled as of Monday afternoon, most of them heading to airports around New York, Washington, Boston and Philadelphia, according to FlightAware.com. 
Blizzard warnings also stretched into New Jersey, while winter storm warnings were expanded into Maryland. The National Weather Service warned of potential coastal flooding in New Jersey and Delaware, while also saying that significant snowfall is expected across much of eastern Pennsylvania and New York. 
Massachusetts Gov. Charlie Baker, R, said that the emergency operations centre there would open Tuesday morning, and he echoed other public officials in urging people to stay off of the roads. Boston city officials shuttered their public schools Tuesday. 
In Pennsylvania, state authorities said they are prepared for days of possible snow, beginning with the storms arrival Monday night and extending through snow showers on Wednesday. 
State agencies are taking proactive steps to ensure Pennsylvania is ready for the incoming winter weather and Pennsylvanians should take their own precautions and prepare for adverse conditions, especially for travel, Gov. Tom Wolf, D, said in a statement. 
Eastern Massachusetts could see up to 18 inches of snow, with the flakes falling on Tuesday morning, and pummeling gusts up to 55 mph could arrive as well, the weather service forecast. 

Boston and other cities in that area have a blizzard watch Tuesday afternoon through evening, with between 12 and 18 inches expected, and a forecast that warned of heavy snow and the potential for blizzard conditions.

Merkels trip to Washington postponed to Friday  due to severe weather
	
DPA, 14th MARCH, 2017 - German Chancellor Angela Merkels first face-to-face meeting with US President Donald Trump will have to wait a few days because of severe weather in the Monday forecast for Washington. 
White House spokesman Sean Spicer said the decision was made after consultations between the White House and the chancellors office. 
The postponement, which Merkels office in Berlin also announced, came just before Merkel was to depart for Washington. The flight was scheduled to land at Washingtons international airport just a few hours after the storm is due to begin late Monday.  Merkel plans to warn Trump about the dangers of protectionism and isolation under his America First trade stance when she meets Trump. 
The chancellor and Trump have had a fractious start to their relationship, clashing on a range of issues, from trade and the currency market to the role of multinational organizations.

BUSTED: When you have a nosebleed, you should sit up and bring your head forward in order to spit out blood. When you hold your head back, there is no effect and when you lie down it is worse. Holding your head back makes the blood flow into your throat and you can swallow it, which is dangerous, as you can choke. Some common instances where you can experience nosebleeds include picking your nose with your fingernails or when children put foreign objects inside. Drugs and alcohol are also a cause. A high intake of alcohol can cause a platelet problem; platelet dysfunction doesnt allow the blood to clot. Platelet problems also appear when one has dengue fever which can also cause nosebleeds. Another cause is humus, which is not visible from the outside. It is visible only when we examine them.

Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery
	

Dr. P. Kirupakaran, Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeon at the Kalutara Hospital and the President of the Sri Lanka Association of Oral and Maxillofacial Surgeons said Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery (OMS) specializes in treating diseases, injuries and defects in the oral and maxillofacial regions.
Maxillofacial refers to the upper and lower jaw. Thus, this practice includes treatment of the mouth, both jaws and the face. OM surgeons are qualified in dental surgery and receive special training in maxillofacial surgery. 
Speaking of when people go to an OM surgeon he said, Usually patients are referred from dental surgeons, as they are the primary qualified people. When it comes to birth defects, patients are referred from paediatricians. Likewise, when there could be cancers and other diseases, they are referred from other specialities and we treat them. 
Dr. Kirupakaran further said that many patients came in with birth defects. One of the more common birth defects seen is cleft lip. Some babies are born with a separated lip or separated roof of the mouth called the cleft palate and they need special care from childhood to adulthood, so we manage them. Likewise, there are many defects we treat but the cleft lip and cleft palate are the most common ones. Some people are born with a small mandible, meaning that the bottom jaw is smaller than usual. Sometimes one side of the patients face doesnt develop properly. Such defects are treated by an oral and maxillofacial surgeon. 
He said oral cancer was among the diseases he most commonly saw in patients.Oral cancer is one of the most fatal diseases in our part of the world. In Sri Lanka, oral cancer is the number one killer among cancers. It affects the health system badly. At the Kalutara Hospital, we see about 3 or 4 new cases per week. What we do is remove the lesion and the patient is left with a deformity which should be surgically corrected at once or later on. Sometimes, surgery may not be adequate and they will be sent for radiotherapy or some other treatment, so they will be referred back to us in order to manage any complications arising from this. Such complications include dry mouth, problems with cheeks, gums or ulcers. 
Speaking of the distribution of oral and maxillofacial surgeons in the country, he said, there are Oral and Maxillofacial surgeons in all the major hospitals and in the future we hope to cover all the small hospitals as well. We do special training and trainees have to qualify through an exam. Now we have enough people so we are trying to cover all the general hospitals, district general hospitals and some of the village hospitals. Some areas such as Puttalam do not have an OM surgeon, so patients will have to go to Chilaw. There are some other areas that are in a similar situation. But we are training people in order to cover these areas so our surgeons can visit other hospitals. 
Dr. Kirupakaran further explained how awareness of this practice was spreading in Sri Lanka. We recently celebrated International Oral and Maxillofacial Surgery Day that is celebrated worldwide on February 13. We had a media function on February 8 and on the 13th we celebrated it at the National Dental Institute in Colombo. There was an exhibition and a blood donation. The exhibition was held for schoolchildren as well. We have also conducted small functions island-wide where we distributed pamphlets in order to create awareness on the matter.

The Priority Lane pilot project might be implemented from Battaramulla to Fort, the Minister of Megapolis and Western Development said.
The pilot project carried out in Rajagiriya allocates a lane for passenger buses as a solution to the heavy traffic congestion in the area. The trial will be conducted for a period of one week and will conclude on March 19.
Implemented at the Sri Jayawardenapura Kotte Municipal Council area from the Ayurvedic Junction, Rajagiriya, the plan was not effective on the first day of implementation. However, officials said the traffic condition in the area had vastly improved since, as motorists are now aware of the regulation and are following instructions set out by the authorities.
Speaking to the media, Minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said they faced practical issues on the first two days but were able to launch the project on its third day with minor tweaks. (Thilanka Kanakarathna)

Restore  lost glory of Bhikkhuni order An American Bhikkhunis plea
	
Her soothing and almost musical voice reverberated through the audience of the BMICH committee room when she delivered her much awaited Dhamma talk. 
I decided to give up university studies, relationships and a brilliant career for the Dhamma and today I have absolutely, absolutely no regrets, said the American Buddhist nun Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka. 
The emphasis on the word absolutely was well intended. She has found her peace, her Truth. 
However still the scholar Bhikkhunis mellifluous voice and serene countenance defied the steely determination with which she crossed continents and embraced alien cultures in many faraway lands in her quest for the ultimate Truth. 
The recipient of the 2006 Outstanding Woman in Buddhism Award, the founder of Dhammadharini Vihara in Sonoma Hills California and co-founder of Aranya Bodhi Hermitage in Sonoma Coast, the story of Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka epitomises the extent to which a courageous and intelligent woman would go in pursuit of her true liberation. 
Born in Washington to scientist parents in 1968 Heather Buske had the world at her feet. Young Heather was spiritually inclined as a teenager and her parents encouraged their daughter to have her independent line of thinking on spirituality. 
When Heather was 20 and studying at college a very close friend of hers passed away quite unexpectedly. That shock jolted the young Heather from the American dream. It awakened her to the reality of the impermanence of life. It dawned upon her that externals would never give the stability that one longed for in life. Anything could be taken away from one any time. 
Heather started questioning the meaning of existence. Strong doubts were cast over the bubble of the American dream. 
She left college and went in search of the truth of life. The determined young woman travelled through Europe and then to India and became an Anagarika, a lay person fully committed to practising Buddhism. 
Further travelling saw her meeting her mentor, South Korean senior Bhikkhuni Myeong
Seong Sunim. 
The young Anagarika was trained under the teacher for ten long years. In 1993 she received her Going forth and two years later was inducted as a Samaneri (novice). 
The new Samaneri returned to United States in 1996 having found what she had been looking for all the past years. The following year she received Bhikkhuni ordination in California in the presence of an international gathering of Bhikkhu and Bhikkhuni Sanghas. The newly ordained Buddhist nun  now Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka or Ayya (Honourable in Pali) Tathaaloka, was quite determined to share the Dhamma she learnt, through research and practicing for nearly two decades, with the rest of the world so that they too could see life for what it was. 
She was especially concerned about the welfare of the women, who were into monastic life. There were small burgeoning communities of Theravada Bhikkhunis and Samaneris in the United States and the need for an umbrella organization for those scattered communities was strongly felt by Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka. She proposed and took part in establishing the North American Bhikkhuni Association (NABA) in 2005.  The years that passed saw her founding two monasteries for Bhikkhunis  Dhammadharini Vihara and Aranya Bodhi Hermitage both in California. 
After ten years into her ordination Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka was offered the higher ordination as a senior Bhikkhuni and she gained reputation as an eminent Bhikkhuni preceptor owing to her vast knowledge on Dhamma. In the years that followed she took part in a slew of Samaneri and Bhikkhuni ordinations as a Bhikkhuni preceptor in the USA, Australia and Thailand including the much spoken about initiation in Perth in 2009 facilitated by Ajahn Brahmavamso and Bhante Sujato.  Today Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka is a beacon of inspiration to informed Buddhist women, both lay and clergy, all over the world. Though a frequent traveller, for some reason the Venerable Bhikkhuni had not been able to visit Sri Lanka till late February this year. This is despite her longing to visit Anuradhapura and pay respect to Sanghamitta stupa ever since she had heard about the monument. 
From the moment she landed in the thrice blessed island where Theravada Buddhism has been flourishing for more than two and half millennia, Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka had felt an overwhelming feeling of blessedness. 
The eminent scholar Bhikkhuni almost ran out of words when she described what exactly she felt during her Dhamma talk at the BMICH. I was not in the best of health when I left (US) but am already feeling better a week into my arrival here, she said smiling. 
The sight of the ever present Bo Trees and Buddha statues which are a rarity in her own land and elsewhere, the Venerable Bhikkhuni said, made her feel blessed and fortunate by the very experience. For the attendees of the talk no doubt it was a reminder of the extent to which they themselves have taken these ubiquitous symbols of Buddhism in their own land for granted. 
A country with a long lineage of Bhikkhunis Sri Lanka has also spared her of confusions that she often experiences elsewhere. Laughingly the Venerable Bhikkhuni told the audience that she was not even once mistaken as a monk during her visit from airport restroom onwards. 
Referring to Sri Lanka as Dhammadipa Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka drew attention to the fact that Sri Lankans have been truly blessed with the wide availability of the Dhamma and the presence of good Dhamma teachers. 
Following the ice breaker and pleasantries the Bhikkhuni introduced her topic -the need for better recognition of Bhikkhuni Sangha, all over the world. This means offering it the same degree of respect, dignity and recognition accorded by Buddha himself. Debunking misconceptions and misinterpretations on Buddhas stand on Bhikkhuni Sasana the scholar nun presented a slew of examples from Pali Canon to substantiate her argument that Buddha accorded equal status to women in his Sasana. 
When queried by the audience on Buddhas postponement of ordaining her foster mother, Bhikkhuni Tathaaloka reminded that Buddha rejected his own father King Suddhodanas request for ordination. 
She requested Buddhist here to create conditions for a renaissance of the Bhikkhuni order which had gone through some challenging times as regards parity of institutional recognition. Dozens and dozens of female Bhikkhunis like Tathaaloka continue to cross continents and oceans seeking Dhamma even 2600 years after the Great Renunciation of Prince Siddhartha marked with the crossing of river Anoma. 
This no doubt speaks volumes of the strength and commitment of women who aspire to be liberated through Dhamma just much as the power of Dhamma itself to stand the test of time  more than two and half millennia. 
In their call for the due recognition of the Bhikkhuni Sasana these female renunciants join hands with the hundreds of Asian renunciants - Bhikkhunis and samaneris, who have committed themselves to Buddhas teaching, 
Its high time that the relevant authorities and institutions give the much deserved attention to this matter which has been dragged on for too long.

Tell-tale signs of Parkinsons Disease
	

  1 in 100 adults over 65 years sufferfrom Parkinsons
	  Tremors, imbalance and slow movement among the subtle symptoms


Imagine waking up one day, after a sleepless night to find out that your limbs have a mind of their own. Lifting your arm to reach for a glass of water needs some concentration and a simple effort to laugh at a joke will drain you of all energy. For those living with Parkinsons disease, this is a daily reality they struggle to accept. 
Parkinsons disease (PD) is a long-term degenerative disorder of the central nervous system that mainly affects the motor system. While there is plenty of research on PD in Western medicine, it still remains a disease with no cure. The Daily Mirror spoke to Consultant Ayurvedic Physician Dr. Indunil Wadiyarathne to identify the challenges posed by this dreadful disease. 
In traditional Ayurveda medicine, PD is identified as Kampawathaya. The disease doesnt discriminate between lifestyle choices of the rich or poor and can affect anyone. Research suggests that 1 in 100 adults over 65 years are suffering from PD. What is interesting is that this number is much higher in developed countries than in developing countries. Reports also indicate that males are more susceptible to the disease than females, however there is no research to confirm this variance, he said. 
Identifying symptoms of Parkinsons disease
A person suffering from PD may complain of aches in the arms and legs, which could be early signs of rigidity in the body. They may have trouble with balance and will often experience falls, also called postural instability. A person with postural instability will have problems walking, balancing and turning around. Falls may occur repeatedly, without explanation. Postural instability isnt usually present with diagnosis but its one of the most common and troublesome symptoms that are present later on. 
Dr. Waidyarathne said most patients initially sought treatment for body aches or inexplicable weakness and fatigue in the body, stressing the importance of seeking medical advice if they suffer from subtle symptoms. The symptoms of PD are somewhat unique. The first noticeable symptoms are small, such as a loss of smell, constipation and possible sleeping disorders. The most identifiable symptoms of the disease develop at the middle stage of the disease and start to attack a persons ability to move. An individual suffering from PD can be suffering from one or all three of these symptoms which are more visible among the elderly. This stage is characterised by three symptoms: tremors, rigidity and aknesia, Dr. Waidyarathne said. 
According to Dr. Waidyarathne, there is no lab test that can determine if a person is a victim of the disease. However, practitioners trained in conditions of the nervous system will diagnose Parkinsons disease, based on a patients medical history, a review of the signs and symptoms, together with a neurological and physical examination. 
Tremors: Even though shakiness is quite common in elderly people, shakiness in PD is different as they are mostly involuntary. Tremors usually occur in the hands but they can also appear in other parts of the body, including the lower lip, jaw or leg. This usually improves when a person starts performing tasks or making use of the limb in some way. 
Resting Tremors: In the early stages of the disease, about 70 percent of people experience a slight tremor in the hand or foot on one side of the body, or less commonly in the jaw or face. A typical onset is tremor in one finger. The tremor consists of a shaking or oscillating movement and usually appears when a persons muscles are relaxed, or at rest, hence the term resting tremor. The affected body part trembles when it is not performing an action. Typically, the fingers or hand will tremble when folded in the lap, or when the arm is held loosely at the side, i.e., when the limb is at rest. The tremor usually ceases when a person begins an action. Some people with PD have noticed that they can stop a hand tremor by keeping the hand in motion or in a flexed grip. The tremor of PD can be exacerbated by stress or excitement, sometimes attracting unwanted notice. The tremor often spreads to the other side of the body as the disease progresses but usually remains most apparent on the initially affected side. Although tremors are the most noticeable outward sign of the disease, not all people with PD will develop them. 
Instances when tremors can indicate PD:

Clots, tumours or bleeding in the Cerebellum. 
	Diseases or disorders in the Brain stem 
	Addiction to alcohol or drugs 
	Over-active thyroid glands leading to overproduction of thyroxine 
Nevertheless, with none of these disorders present in the body, a person can still experience tremors. This causes great discomfort in a persons day-to-day activities and will affect social situations. 
Rigidity: Rigidity causes stiffness and inflexibility of the limbs, neck and trunk. Muscles normally stretch when they move, and then relax when they are at rest. In Parkinsons, the muscle tone of an affected limb is always stiff and does not relax, sometimes contributing to a decreased range of motion. People with PD most commonly experience tightness of the neck, shoulder and leg. A person with rigidity tends to not swing his or her arms when walking. Rigidity can be uncomfortable or even painful. 
Postural Instability: One of the main signs of Parkinsons is postural instability, a tendency to be unstable when standing. A person with postural instability will have lost some of the reflexes needed to maintain an upright posture and may topple backwards if jostled even slightly. Some develop a dangerous tendency to sway backwards when rising from a chair, standing or turning. This problem is called retropulsion and may result in a backwards fall.
People with balance problems may have particular difficulty when pivoting or making turns or quick movements. 
Akinesia: This is a loss of standard motor functions or slowness that causes impaired movement of muscle; plainly without movement or without much movement. Akinesia might disturb all or only a portion of the body. It also apathy and decrease in unplanned motion. These side-effects are a lot like the apathy and slowness linked with depression or the negative symptoms of schizophrenia and therefore are often misdiagnosed or left untreated. 
In other words, this means slow movement, a defining feature of Parkinsons which give the appearance of abnormal stillness and a decrease in facial expression. It causes difficulty with repetitive movements, such as finger tapping. Due to bradykinesia, a person with Parkinsons may have difficulty performing everyday functions, such as buttoning a shirt, cutting food or brushing his or her teeth. People who experience akinesia may walk with short, shuffling steps. The reduction in movement and the limited range of movement caused by akinesia can affect a persons speech, which may become quieter and less distinct as Parkinsons progresses. 
Various tests can be conducted to identify hidden diseases through these symptoms. However, modern science has not been able to come up with a single test that can diagnose PD. Therefore, the diagnosis of PD is entirely dependent on the proper and early identification of symptoms.

Tips to reduce Carbon emissions in day-to-day lives
	
By Kamanthi Wickramasinghe
Global warming is caused by the emission of greenhouse gases and 72% of the totally emitted greenhouse gases are Carbon dioxide (CO2). Carbon emissions are a direct contributor to global warming and the numbers are getting higher by the day. Carbon dioxide emissions therefore are the most important cause of global warming. CO2 is inevitably created by burning fuels like such as oil, natural gas, diesel, organic-diesel, petrol, organic-petrol and ethanol. The emissions of CO2 have been dramatically increased within the last 50 years and are still increasing by almost 3% each year. Following are a few ways in which you could possibly reduce Carbon emissions during your daily activities.
Alternatives to driving - When possible, walk or ride your bike in order to avoid carbon emissions completely. Carpooling and public transportation drastically reduce CO2 emissions by spreading them out over many riders.
Drive a low carbon vehicle - High mileage doesnt always mean low CO2 emissions. All vehicles have an estimated miles-per-gallon rating. Electric cars emit no CO2 if theyre charged with clean electricity.
Driving style - Speeding and unnecessary acceleration reduce mileage by up to 33%, waste gas and money, and increase your carbon footprint.
Tire inflation and other tuning- Properly inflated tires improve your gas mileage by up to 3%. It also helps to use the correct grade of motor oil, and to keep your engine tuned, because some maintenance fixes, like fixing faulty oxygen sensors, can increase fuel efficiency by up to 40%.
Try to avoid traffic- Being stuck in traffic wastes gas and unnecessarily creates CO2. Use traffic websites and apps and go a different way or wait.
Appliances - Make energy efficiency a primary consideration when choosing a new furnace, air conditioning unit, dishwasher, or refrigerator.
Lighting -Turn off lights youre not using and when you leave the room. Replace incandescent light bulbs with compact fluorescent or LED ones.
Solar - Add solar panels to the roof of your home. This costs a little more than the above options, but many providers offer financing options which minimize upfront costs.
Eat locally-produced and organic food - It has been estimated that 13% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the production and transport of food. Transporting food requires petroleum-based fuels, and many fertilizers are also fossil fuel-based.
Water usage - Lower the amount of energy used to pump, treat, and heat water by washing your car less often, using climate-appropriate plants in your garden, installing drip irrigation so that plants receive only what they need, and making water-efficient choices when purchasing shower heads, faucet heads, toilets, dishwashers and washing machines.
Reuse and recycle - It has been estimated that 29% of U.S. greenhouse gas emissions result from the provision of goods, which means the extraction of resources, manufacturing, transport, and final disposal of goods which include consumer products and packaging, building components, and passenger vehicles, but excluding food. By buying used products and reselling or recycling items you no longer use, you dramatically reduce your carbon footprint from the provision of goods.
Support clean energy sources - Whenever you can, advocate for clean alternatives to fossil fuels, such as wind, solar, geothermal, and appropriately designed hydroelectric and biomass energy projects.
With the increase in the number of vehicles on the streets, traffic has become a major problem in Sri Lanka today. Such traffic congestions would result in CO2 emissions and therefore it is advisable to use alternative methods of transport during such times. As the country is quite concerned on sustainable development, it is important to note that there are several commercial entities willing to help you in this process. United Tractors is one such source that specialises in distributing electric power in Sri Lanka. Today, many of the biggest buildings and industrial facilities in the country are powered by Cat generators. The most power dependent institutions such as hospitals and 5 star hotels too rely on Cat power.

Today is World Consumer Day Building a Digital World Consumers Can Trust
	
World Consumer Day which falls today (15) is a time for celebration, activism, and solidarity, among the consumer and consumer organizations worldwide.
World Consumer Day originated in 1983 and subsequently consumer rights gained international recognition and legitimacy when guidelines set by the United Nations were adopted. On March 15th 1962 John F Kennedy announced that consumers, by definition, were the largest economic group that effect and are affected by almost every private and public economic decision made, yet they are the only important group whose views are often not heard.
Today things have changed, as in the West the consumer is both organised and powerful. World Consumer Day is a day to celebrate and acknowledge the strength and power of the consumer. Seminars, workshops and shows of activism give a sense of power and strength to the consumer. In this context, todays junk food generation has come in for much discussion and the adverse effects of junk food on the health of the human beings-especially children- has been a popular and important topic of discussion on a day such as today. Some topics chosen for discussion on this day in the past were Unethical Drug Promotion (2007), GM Food (2005) Consumers and Water (2004) and Control of Food Chain (2003).
The fact that the same topic, Junk Food, has been taken up for discussion consecutively for two years indicates the importance of the issue. Twenty-two million children around the world are already overweight. Children are often targeted by multinational organisations for their commercials and promotions. As a result there is a long-felt need to urge the world to introduce an international code of conduct when marketing unhealthy food items directed at children.
World Consumer Day focuses on initiatives, planned functions and projects carried out by consumer organisations on every continent. This takes the shape of special campaigns press conferences, exhibitions, workshops, publications and similar events targeting consumerism. There are websites, Magazines, books, and
on-going activities promoting the rights of the citizen. Unfortunately in Sri Lanka there is less activism in this regard leaving the consumer at the mercy of errant traders and industrialists who continue to exploit them freely. 
CONSUMER
The Consumer is defined in the Consumer Affairs Authority Act No 9 of 2003, as any actual user of any goods or services made available for a consideration by a trader or manufacturer which is a unique and a broader definition from the common law perspective. In a literal sense, a consumer is one who preachers goods or services (Longman Dictionary of the English Language, 2nd Ed.) (Harlow: Longman1991) For the purpose of the English consumer protection law, the term consumer has narrower meaning which is based on the capacity in which the consumer and the supplier of the goods have acted. Until the introduction of the CAA act of 2003-hereafter known as the Act, by replacing Consumer Protection Act, no 1 of 1979, Fair Trading Commission Act No 1 of 1987, and the Control of Prices Act (Chapter 173), consumerism in Sri Lanka was primarily governed by principles of English Law which desires to provide for better protection of consumers through the regulation of trade and the prices of goods and services and to protest against traders and manufacturers, against unfair trade practices and restrictive trade practices and promoting competitive pricing wherever possible and ensure healthy competition among traders and manufactures of goods and services. This is a complete transformation of the principle and procedure of price control to Regulation and Competitive trade, which is a mixture of how the US, Australian and European models work. 
Definition
The definition covers actual and potential users of goods and services which gives a further and broader meaning and an area including every citizen worldwide in the definition who is a potential consumer in this competitive and developed world. The standard perception of a consumer is of an individual purchaser of goods or services and in most cases it will be the case. Most of the provisions of the Consumer Credit Act, 1974 (CCA) (UK) only apply where the debtor is an individual under English Law, and generally a non-business purchaser. In the Sri Lankan context any actual user could be a company or a juristic personality. In the UK much of the legislation can be regarded as being directed towards fair trading rather than consumer protection. Many modern consumer protection measures no longer require proof of fraud. A trader can be found guilty of a criminal offence without proof of criminal intent. 
CAA- Consumer Affairs Authority - the Main Regulator in Sri Lanka
The main legislations on consumerism in Sri Lanka before and during the introduction of the Act - some of which are replaced, amended, and replaced were the Consumer Protection Act, Fair Trading Commission Act, Control of Prices Act, Trademarks Ordinance, Prisons, Opium, and Dangerous Drugs Ordinance, Control of Prices Ordinance, Weights and Measures Ordinance, Food and Drugs Act, Control of Prices Act, Food Control Act, Licensing of Traders Act, Bureau of Ceylon Standards, National Prices Commission Law, Consumer Protection Act, Code of Intellectual Property Act, Petroleum Products Act, Food Act, Cosmetic Devices and Drugs Act, Consumer Credit Act, Sri Lanka Standards Institution Act, Fair Trading Commission Act, Measurement United Standards and Services Act, Unfair Contract Terms Act. Today the concept of price control is replaced by regulatory powers where it is controlled by regulation, indirect means and competition. How far and whether this is a success is a moot issue. 
Are We At The Doorsteps Of The Digital Age
Consumer International selects timely topics in the process of activism for consumers worldwide. It was fix your phones right, healthy dilates in 2015 and antibiotic resistance in 2016, which were current and timely then. The world is fast approaching the digital age with 3 billion citizens worldwide going online daily, which is 30% of the world population. Sri Lanka presently has 23 million mobile phones, 5 million internet users and 3.5 million people using facebook, which is close to international standards, when almost every citizen possesses a mobile phone and with a substantial decrease in the number of landlines. Online shopping on sites such as E-Bay and Amazon is growing fast with an enormous future potential predicted. Meanwhile, consumerism in Sri Lanka is lagging behind with no amendments being made to the Consumer Affairs Authority Act now considered to be archaic with no changes or improvements being made to it since 2003, with a question mark remaining on the legal protection provided by the main regulator in the country. Online shopping, credit cards, local digital platforms and worldwide platforms such as eBay, and major players are freely available in Sri Lanka with the clientle increasing fast unnoticed and untouched by the traditional regulatory procedures in the absence of a mechanism and lack of knowledge of the Sri Lankan regulators in the dark on the digital age. 
Building A Digital World the Consumer Can Trust-Theme of 2017
CAA is the main regulator in the country on consumerism responsible for regulating the quality, standards, prices, and access to consumer items and services at a reasonable price without poisonous and hazardous matter and providing services of accepted standards to the consumer freely, through regulatory powers. This mechanism is important as it involves the future, health, wealth and the existence of the nation.
In 2017 with the theme Building A Digital World the Consumer Can Trust we hope the momentum that was gathered by the programme planned during this period would continue till next year. We wish and pray that all the parties concerned, namely the consumer, trader, manufacturer, industrialist, and the State (CAA and the Ministry of Consumer Affairs) will work hand in hand realizing and aiming at their honourable aims and objectives in making the consumer happy and satisfied. 
Consumer Trust
Developing consumer trust is an arduous task in the highly complicated digital era. Digital Storms are blowing away the human mind which is the most advanced computer now depending on artificial intelligence and advanced digital technological developments. We are at the door steps of the modern digital transforming the entire style on the modern advanced systems and innovations in all areas of human life. Consumers are inadequately protected by traditional safeguards provided by respective legal systems worldwide and out-dated regulatory powers in Sri Lanka incapable of meeting the modern challenges in the digital e-com age. Consumer trust will be developed with the modern trends with the success of a mechanism which is not introduced yet meeting the new trends needs and requirements. For example the world and local e-sale-business transactions platforms have their own regulatory powers and remedies due to ferocious competition and self-regulation to safeguard their present and future customers/ consumers in the hands of their mercy.
Sections 7,8, 9,10,12,13,15,16,17,18,19,21,22,26,27,28,29,30,31,32,34,35,36, 39,45, of the act which deal with the operational and conceptual matters have to be adopted/amended to meet the current challenges and a discussion and complete overhaul of the act and the working procedure is an urgent necessity to meet the digital challenges. 
Way Forward For The Happiness And The Satisfaction Of The Consumer
In the United Kingdom magazine Which media, Citizen Advice Bureaux, Legal Aid System, Consumer organizations, NGOs with the State are protecting the consumer with the network of the consumer organizations and consumer groups. Citizen is used to look upon which magazine for directions and information which is a medium for information, advice and guidance, available to the citizen. The European Union spreads its tentacles over the member countries in safeguarding consumer by/through directions. Consumerism in India is organized and powerful with governmental support, legislation, legal system and separate Consumer Courts for implementation with the Judiciary favouring public interest litigations and class actions as in USA and UK even against giant multinational Cola, and Junk food Chains poisoning and making the entire world potential patents. Consumerism and consumer protection models are organized and effective in the Socialist Block and the Commonwealth with different legal systems. There is uniformity in the Commonwealth including Canada, Australia, with similar legal systems and its Sri Lankan model is a mixture of Australian, UK, models and European concepts. The Consumer is powerful and considered to be a King in other parts of the world able to flex muscles on the parties concerned for just and fair treatment on consumerism, with the adage Consumer is always Right practised in the competitive trade. It is a satisfactory trend that the CAA, IPS and Consumer Organization led by powerful activists have organized events with the participation of Mr Satya representing the World Consumer Federation based in the United Kingdom and we hope a new chapter and a trend will emerge as a result with the influence and participation of the Consumer International , State, Trader, Industrialist, and the Consumer with a joint and consorted effort achieving happiness and satisfaction of the consumer badly in need of assistance. We hope and pray Sri Lanka will have the strength and vision to set up a network of consumer organizations, a proper legal mechanism with amendments to meet the modern challenges, with the concept alert consumer and just trader, to work with all concerned parties namely consumer, trader, industrialist and the state hand in hand in the interest of the citizen deserves closer attention.

Vajiras enduring passion and love for dance A story of inexpressible grace
	

Vajira turns 85 today 
	The first ballet Kumudini was done when she was only 19
	The Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, February 16, 1963 paid glowing tribute to Vajira
	She created 17 childrens ballets in total

There is a little girl. About 15 years old. She sits across the table from me. Her voice is firm and her eyes dance as she speaks about her love. She is young enough and old enough to identify true love among passing fancies, infatuation and hero-worship. There was a time when she would prefer to do other things, as much as she adored this love, but that was before. That was when she was less than 10 years old. But now, somewhere in 1947, she knew enough to weigh heart and mind, direct them to acquire the most fruitful engagement with the world around her in its wholeness and constituent parts.
Her name is Vajira 
Sitting right in front of me, the little girl became a young woman, and then a mother. She became a grandmother and a great grandmother too. And through it all, her voice remained firm. Her eyes continued to dance. And with an unwavering voice, she transcribed memories into words, traced the dance steps from then to now in a choreography that did justice to a life dedicated to uphold the sacredness of the dance. 
Her mother had specific plans for all her children. She had wanted Vajiras sister to become a doctor, and she did. The brothers were to study law, but they ended up as engineers. She wanted Vajira to dance and learn music. She was sent for Violin classes and dance classes too. She danced. 
When she was about eight, Vajiras mother had sent her to Sripalee. Rabindranath Tagore had helped set up this institution, then dedicated to music and dance. At the time, Vajira had been attending Kalutara Balika Vidyalaya. Anangala Athukorale, a part-time dancer teacher at her school who also taught at Sripalee, had played a pivotal role in this decision. 
Her father, employed at the Urban Council, was in charge of letting out the Town Hall for various performances. He ensured there was always a row of seats for his family, and that is how the iconic Chitrasena had come into their lives. He had come to perform. Vajiras mother had immediately arranged for him to conduct classes at home. She had got hold of her friends and urged them to send their children for this class. There had been eight in all, including Vajira and her sister. 
Vajira was interested and talented, but she was still a child. She had other interests as well and did her best to bunk these classes. Chitrasena had visited Kalutara for a while and the two families had become good friends. Later, when Vajiras sister needed a place to stay in Colombo as she was attending Medical College, their mother had approached the Chitrasenas who had arranged for her to stay with them as a boarder. 
When Vajira was around 11, her mother had decided that she should study in Colombo. She was duly enrolled at Methodist College, which was located right opposite
Chitrasenas house.
And so, she too was boarded there. That house was all about music and dance. Vajira went to school in the morning and in the evening, would attend Chitrasenas dance classes and also learn Sitar from Edwin Samaradiwakara. Once she reached 15, it was all about dance and nothing else. 
Naturally, I followed Chitra everywhere. I went for every show. I must have started to like him at some point. I was 18 when we got married. 
By that time, she was the lead female dancer of the troupe, but apparently she lacked the physique to play the lead female roles. In Nala-Damayanthi, for instance, she always played the Swan while various dancers played Damayanthi. When it was first produced, Chitrasena had done the choreography. But later in 1963, when they performed Nala-Damayanthi in Sydney, he had let Vajira handle it. He probably thought I was, by that time, capable of handling my own scenes, Vajira said. The Sydney Morning Herald of Saturday, February 16 paid glowing tribute to Vajira. 
Balletomanes who see the second programme of the Chitrasena Ballet, which was presented at the Elizabethan Theatre last night, will receive a shock, for there they will find the original of their beloved classical-romantic ballet, Swan Lake.
The various pas de deux, performed by Vajira, as the Chief Swan, and Wimal, as the noble King Nala, leave, it must be confessed, our Swan Lake sadly lacking in imagination and understanding.
This critic has not seen in Western ballet mime, acting and dancing, capable of evoking the nature and spirit of the swan, to compare with the performance of Vajira in this role.
The show must go one, Chitrasena often said, she recalls. And so it did. Her involvement was intense and passionate, even while pregnant she had continued to dance and choreograph although she didnt perform. 
By and by she came to creating her own ballets. The first, Kumudini was done when she was only 19. The following year she created Hima Kumariya and in 1955, Sepalika. By this time she was a part-time dance teacher in schools and she experimented with her young students. In 1956, she produced Kindurangana. She created 17 childrens ballets in total. 
Some of these she remembers on account of them being landmark creations of a kind. For example, Rankikili, a childrens ballet, is remembered because her daughter Upekha was by that time big enough to perform the lead role of the Kikili. Her other daughter Anjali played the role of the old lady who kept
the fire going.
But what was most significant about this ballet, first performed in 1968, was that it was the first time a ballet was performed without any words or songs, just melody and dance. It was artistically of a very high standard, Vajira recalls. 
Nil Yaka, was based on a story by the most accomplished writer of childrens stories, Sybil Wettasinghe. Sybil incidentally had done the decor and created the set. 
Seventy years is a long time. Time enough to be afflicted with selective memory, time enough to even forget and be forgiven for it. But Vajira remembers that Chitrasenas first student, Somabandu, usually handled the decor and costumes. Samaradivakara and Titus Nonis were both music teachers and had created the melodies for the childrens ballet Hapana in 1979. Victor Perera had composed all the melodies for Andaberaya in 1976. As for her, she claims she had mostly drawn inspiration from something she had read. 
Vajira remembers Kinkini Kolama, a story about how the nilames or the lords responded to a man who fell in love with a low-caste girl. It was Chitrasenas concept. I added the dance and we drew from the nadagam style. This was Upekhas first in a lead role. In a way, it was the show which introduced her as the lead female dancer
of the troupe. 
There had been hiccups of course. In the beginning, they did not have a permanent place to rehearse until E.P.A. Fernando, a friend of Chitrasenas father, had let him conduct his work at his place. In a more here-and-now incident, Vajira had sprained her ankle on the opening night of a Moscow performance, just as she was to enter. Immediately, her sister Vipuli had taken over. It was a seamless transition and apparently no one had known, except the troupe of course. On another occasion, when they had gone for a performance in Australia, the drums had been quarantined causing much anxiety. Vajira remembers Chitrasena eventually emerging with the drums, all smiles. 
That is how it has been. It is about continuity. It is about the show going on. There is Vajira and then there was Upekkha. And now there is Thaji, Vajiras granddaughter. Passion, dedication, endless striving for perfection and the grace in mind and body that inevitably results. Sacred is the word Chitrasena used. The Kalayathanaya produced many, many ballets. Vajira created the dances, did the choreography and taught the dancers, always under the watchful eyes of Chitrasena, she says. 
The names go together: Chitrasena-Vajira. It is hard to say what one would have been without the other, but for Vajira it is easily resolved. 
It was always under his guidance and permission that I had to get the production ready. He handled the direction and was in charge of the presentation. He was the inspiration. He was our strength. Part of my confidence in all this can be attributed to him being there, always watching and ready to put things right in case anything went wrong. His blessings were always there. He taught us so much and what we learnt we pass on to our students. He is always present in the work we do. 
And yet, she said there were times she missed his physical presence. That is how it is with those who are ahead of their times and who tower over the present on account of vision and realisation. 
It was not just Chitrasena though. Vajira is ever grateful to her mother, Chitrasenas mother and his unmarried sisters who took care of everything so that all she had to do was dance, and teach. After sometime, Chitrasena had given up teaching and thereafter Vajira had to be in charge of instruction, creation and continuity. Those responsibilities have now been handed over to Upekha. 
I never stopped teaching. I created the syllabus and it is still being used. I created special exercises that made it easier to learn traditional movements. Now, I dont demonstrate. I use a good student for this. 
In 1963, Anna Ilupina wrote in Izvestia: Every gesture in her slender hands, every glance from her beautiful oval eyes, every movement is full of inexpressible grace. She might as well have been writing about Vajira today. 
There is a young girl sitting across the table from me. Her voice is firm and her eyes dance as she speaks about her love. She is young enough and old enough to identify true love among passing fancies, infatuation and hero-worship. And she knows that it is sacred. She is 85 years old. She says I am happy to have contributed to the dance  in my young days, and even now, and until I die.

What your nails say about your health
	

Nails are not just a surface reserved for decoration. Experts can find clues to internal abnormalities and diseases just by detecting the texture, colour, shape and overall appearance of nails. Problems in the liver, lung and heart could be detected by signs in nails. 
It is always a good habit to take care of your appearance. Thats why you should check for changes in your skin and nails constantly. 
What are nails
A horny sheath protecting the upper end of each finger and toe of humans and most other primates. - Merriam - Webster Dictionary 

How should normal nails look
Usually pinkish, smooth surface and with a healthy glow 

Good habits for healthy nails

Use a personal nail cutter 
	Cut nails often. The shape of fingernails dont matter but toenails are usually square 
	Keep nails clean 
	Manicures and pedicures should be done only by professionals. 
	When polishing nails, the top coat and base coat are mandatory 
	Remove nail polish once a week 
	Minimize the use of nail polish, nail polish removers and harsh chemicals on nails 
	If any abnormalities occur, do not hide them with nail extensions, visit a doctor if necessary. 


Nails and health
Yellow Nails - Nails with a yellow tinge - Yellow nails could indicate an underlying issue of lymphatic system. In chronic situations such as kidney diseases, nails look more whitish. Fungal infections are also responsible for yellow nails. Smoking stains also appear. Nail polish too can cause this. 
Nail Clubbing - Nails bent at the edge - loss of normal angle in the nail bed is the reason for this condition. The tips of nails are swollen or bulging and curve downward. 

White spots - Small white patches on nails - Children enjoy these as they think they signify new friendships. They are normal on childrens nails. 
On some occasions, certain types of medication for diseases like cancer are also responsible for dark pigmentation of nails. Skin pigmentations could differ and lead to spots. 
Ridges - Vertical lines occur due to age. Only horizontal ridges need attention. On a few occasions, these horizontal ridges may indicate situations like heavy metal poisoning. 
Brittle nails - Common among people with dry skin. Its advisable to apply moisturising creams like Aqueous cream on the nail and the nail folds. 
Dark bands - Small vertical lines in darker tone - Longitudinal dark bands are common in dark-skinned people. At other times they are caused by Melanoma, skin cancer, which is a rare condition. 

Beaus lines - Horizontal lines on nail 
These may occur following a serious illness which puts a strain on the bodys resources. Nail growth slows down during the illness and later appear as horizontal lines on the nail. Foot and mouth disease and Dengue fever are two examples. 
Nail pitting - Small pits in nails - They are common in conditions such as Psoriasis and look like scaling. It is normal for nails to look irregular when people have eczema. 
Viral warts - warts appear around the nails and spread to adjacent areas. This needs quick medical attention or it will spread and destroy the nail. 
Paronychia - Nail fold starts swelling  this occurs when inflammation takes place in the nail fold. Exposure to excess amounts of water, detergents and soap may lead to this. In addition to medication, measures to minimize exposure to water and detergents are necessary to cure this condition. 
Pale nails - whitish nails due to lack of blood circulation - this pallor is common in Anaemia and malnutrition. 
Lifting nails (Onycholysis) -nails look separate from the nail bed - they are lifted upward from the nail bed. An aggressive manicure, nail hardeners or glues could also cause damage. If the nail colour has also changed to opaque white, green or yellow, this could point to everything from a thyroid disease or psoriasis to injury and infection.
