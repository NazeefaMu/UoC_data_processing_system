Govt. should seek views of all parties on ETCA with India: MR
	
Former President Mahinda Rajapaksa today urged the government to table the Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement (ETCA) in parliament, and seek the views of the trade chambers, professional associations and the general public before making a decision to enter into the agreement.
Releasing a statement the former President said the arrogant attitude the government had taken in this matter may end up ruining the chances of forging a mutually beneficial trade partnership with our neighbour.
?The government has indicated that they intend to sign an Economic and Technological Cooperation Agreement with India this month. Neither the Parliament, nor the general public have been officially informed about the contents of this proposed agreement. From the draft that has been unofficially released to professional associations by Minister Malik Samarawickrema, we gather that the proposed ETCA is not a detailed document but only a framework agreement which would leave the specific details on the trade in goods and services and investment to be worked out later,? the statement said.

Govt. should send Sandeep abroad: Gammanpila
	
The government should send Sandeep Sampath Gunawardena, the victim of the hit and run accident allegedly involving Megapolis and Western Development Minister Champika Ranawaka, overseas for further treatment, MP Udaya Gammanpila said.
Sandeep Sampath was hit by a jeep allegedly driven by the Minister in Rajagiriya is now being treated in the Intensive Care Unit of the National Hospital. ?
Speaking at a media briefing MP Gammanpila, once the Ranawaka?s right hand man, said the government should provide the victim with the best possible treatment to save the reputation of the government.
?It will be not good for the Minister, who played a main role in establishing the government, if he was to die. Therefore they should make every effort to provide him with the best possible treatment,? he said. ?
The MP questioned why Sandeep could not be sent abroad for treatment like Health Minister Dr. Rajitha Senarathne and Late Ven. Maduluwawe Sobitha Thera, who were flown to Singapore for further treatment.
??Sandeep Sampath re-gained consciousness yesterday five days after the accident. Yet, he can?t open his eyes and he can?t speak. The government should intervene, the MP said.
?His friends, who witnessed the accident, said they were being asked by people to meet the minister. They should not try to influence the witnesses in such a manner. We are doing what we can for them as they sought our assistance claiming their lives were at risk. We should be glad the youths have come forward against the injustice meted out to their friend by this powerful Minister,? the parliamentarian said.
Refuting claims that 1000cc motorbikes could not be ridden in Sri Lanka, Gammampila said such motorbikes, including Sandeep?s had been registered with the relevant authorities.
He stated the police had also not done their job properly in recording statements from the eyewitnesses and that they hoped to meet the IGP and the National Police Commission (NPC) with regard to the matter. (Piyumi Fonseka)

HIV rumor: CTU asks Akila to be more sensitive
	
Ceylon Teachers Union (CTU) today condemned Education Minister Akila Viraj Kariyawasam?s statement, where he called for the separation of the child in Kuliyapitiya from his mother, after being denied a school due to rumours of his mother being HIV positive.
In an interview with the BBC Sinhala Sandeshaya, the minister said the Zonal Education Director told him the boy?s mother had HIV and that therefore the child should be separated from her and placed in probationary care.
The CTU General Secretary Joseph Stalin asked the minister to show more sensitivity in the matter.
He said the child should not be separated from the mother, saying the minister had no right to do so.
Further, he said that as an Education Minister, he could not confirm whether the mother was HIV positive.
?As a father, he should understand that all parents love their children. He should not brand the child or his mother. Being the Education Minister of the country, this is not a good example to give the younger generation,? he said. (Piyumi Fonseka)

I am innocent, Douglas Devananda tells Madras High Court
	
Former minister Douglas Devananda on Saturday told the sessions court in Chennai in a video-conference trial that he was in way connected with the killing of a man at Choolaimedu in south Chennai and sought discharge from the murder charge registered against him by the police for that shooting incident three decades ago.
When the case came up for hearing before IV Additional Sessions Court, Douglas? counsel R. Rajan filed an affidavit detailing his stand and seeking discharge from the murder charge. Douglas, originally cited as the third accused, is now facing the trial through videoconference from the Indian High Commission in Colombo as per the order of the Madras high court which permitted his prayer made in 2014, wherein he had stated that he would not be able to go over to Chennai to stand trial in this false case since his life could be in danger?he had then also mentioned about the many attempts on his life by the LTTE considering him an enemy.
Douglas, who heads the Eelam Peoples? Democratic Party (EPDP), had also pleaded with the high court and again now before the sessions court that he should not be considered a proclaimed offender and the non-bailable warrant for his arrest be withdrawn.
When the video-trial began at 10.40 Saturday morning, Douglas rose at the arrival of Judge M. Shanthi and remained standing throughout the hour-long hearing. He appeared calm and composed throughout. He had been waiting at the Indian High Commission for over an hour before the trial began, sources said.
The prosecution case is that Douglas was among some cadres of the Eelam People?s Revolutionary Liberation Front (EPRLF)? of which he was the military wing commander at that time (he quit the group subsequently to launch his own EPDP and join the political mainstream in Sri Lanka in support of the Indo-Lanka Accord to give up arms)?at their Choolaimedu office when one of the men opened fire at some local people, killing one of them named Thirunavukarasu, on November 1, 1986.
Douglas was cited as third accused among the ten listed in the police charge sheet. The prosecution obtained permission from the court to split the case and proceed against Douglas as the rest of the accused remained absconding. The EPDP leader has chosen to cooperate with the trial considering his open political status and the innings as minister in Colombo. His contention has been that he was not even present at the place of the rioting and shooting at Choolaimedu and arrived in an autorickshaw much later.
On noticing the media persons present in the court, Judge Shanthi ordered in-camera proceedings and allowed only the lawyers and other officials connected with the case to be present. As a result, the media had to depend on the post-trial briefing by Douglas? lawyer Rajan and the assistant public prosecutor Ms M Prabavathi?the APP kept referring to the EPRLF cadres involved in the incident as ?LTTE?.
?We prayed the court to discharge Douglas from the murder and rioting charges?, counsel Rajan told reporters outside the court hall. ?Douglas is innocent. The others, Selvanathan, Raghu and Selvam, all Sri Lankan Tamils, quarrelled with the local people at Thiruvalluvarpuram in Choolaimedu. When that angry mob of locals chased them, they ran into their house and brought out the weapon and one of them started shooting, in which Thirunavukarasu was killed. Douglas was not present?, the lawyer insisted.
During the trial, the prosecution produced four witnesses to depose about the incident that happened three decades ago. While witnesses Gurumurthy and Veeramuthu claimed seeing Douglas shooting from the terrace of a house, the other two witnesses Panneerselvam and Mani said they were sure about Douglas? presence there, said APP Prabavathi.
The judge adjourned the case to March 15 for examination of the remaining witnesses. The prosecution has cited 40 persons as witnesses.? National Informatics Centre, which arranged the videoconference trial through a secured loopline from Delhi, has recorded the entire proceedings on a laptop.(DC)

?Occupy the Square? against removal of couple
	
A large gathering today staged a protest at the Independence Square in Colombo, against firm action taken by two security guards to evacuate a couple from the premises.
The demonstration ?Occupy the Square? was organized after a video of the incident was posted on social media, which showed two security officers attempting to evict a couple, stating that the Cultural Affairs Ministry ordered them to do so.
However, Deputy Foreign Affairs Minister Harsha de Silva who arrived at the protest questioned the relevant security officers of their clout in evicting the couple, and stated that a couple being seated at the premises was totally acceptable.
In response, the security guards said they resorted to urge couples to leave the premises due to nothing but mere misconduct.
The minister later posted on his Facebook page that Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe ordered the Cultural Affairs Ministry to cancel the contract with the government owned Security Company in which the two security guards were employed, and also to remove the Director Operations.
