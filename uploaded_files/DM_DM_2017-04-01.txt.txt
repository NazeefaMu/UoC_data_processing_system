Around 150 migrants feared dead after boat sinks
	

Libya, (Courtesy Al-Jazeera), 30.03.2017 - A rubber boat packed with nearly 150 migrants sank in the Mediterranean and the presumed sole survivor - a 16-year-old Gambian boy - told rescuers he believed all other passengers drowned. 
A humanitarian vessel, the Iuventa, found the boy hanging onto a fuel tank in the sea on Tuesday. He was transferred first to an Italian Coast Guard ship, then to a Spanish frigate and brought to the Sicilian island of Lampedusa early on Wednesday.  He said that everyone else died. But theres some hope that the Italian Coast Guard picked up others, said International Migration Organization (IOM) spokesman Flavio Di Giacomo in Rome, after speaking to staff in Lampedusa.

Disgraced Trump aide Mike Flynn asks for immunity to testify on Russia spying allegations
	

Flynn, who resigned as Trumps security adviser after just 24 days, has sent the request to both the FBI and the House and Senate intelligence committees, the Wall Street Journal reports. 
The agencies have not yet taken Flynn up on his offer, according to officials with knowledge of the matter. 
General Flynn certainly has a story to tell, and he very much wants to tell it, should the circumstances permit, said Flynns attorney, Robert Kelner. 
Flynns ties to Russia have been scrutinized by the FBI and are under investigation by the House and Senate intelligence committees. Both committees are looking into Russias meddling in the 2016 presidential election and any ties between Trump associates and the Kremlin. 
His decision comes after he told NBCs Chuck Todd last year that anyone who seeks immunity has probably committed a crime.He made the comments in relation to former Hillary Clinton staffers being granted immunity as the FBI investigated her use of her server when she was secretary of state. 
Flynns resignation in February came after reports emerged that he misled White House staff on his interactions with Russia and discussed sanctions with the Russian ambassador prior to the inauguration.

Ford recalls around 5,000 Kuga SUVs and Fiesta ST hatchbacks
	

Almost 5,000 Ford cars are being recalled after seven vehicles erupted into flames across Australia. 
Owners of a 4450 Ford Kuga SUV or a 400 Fiesta ST hatchback are being urged to hand their vehicles over to a dealership to be repaired after issues with their shared turbo engine. 
There have been reports of fires in seven Ford Kuga vehicles since December 2015, according to Perth Now. The cars have ignited after localised overheating of the engine cylinder head, due to a lack of coolant circulation, according to a statement from Ford Motor Company of Australia Limited. 
The overheating causes the cylinder head to crack, causing an oil leak. 
Ford is asking owners of the Kuga to bring their cars to their nearest dealership between April and June for initial recall work. 
The work will be completed during a necessary second visit between October and December. A time period for repairs to the Fiesta hatchback has yet to be set. 
Parts are not immediately available to carry out repairs on affected vehicles. Ford is working with suppliers to obtain parts as soon as possible. Ford will write to owners of all affected vehicles as soon as parts are available, Ford said in the statement. 
Owners can still drive the vehicles in the meantime but need to maintain the proper engine coolant and be aware of any smoke or overheating.

Growing military cooperation reflects reconciliation progress-US
	
The United States said that growing military-to-military cooperation between the US and Sri Lanka reflects the progress Sri Lanka has made on reconciliation and justice.
Our growing military-to-military cooperation reflects the progress Sri Lanka has made on reconciliation and justice. As Sri Lanka continues to make progress in implementing its commitments to its people and the international community, this will form the basis of further cooperation between our militaries, U.S. Ambassador to Sri Lanka Atul Keshap said in a statement today.
The US embassy said that USS Comstock (LSD 45) departed Sri Lanka today following a week of exchanges with the Sri Lankan Navy and Marine Corps. These exercises focused on improving humanitarian assistance and disaster relief efforts and coordination, the third such military-to-military exchange between U.S. Sailors and Marines and their Sri Lankan counterparts in the past 12 months.

We hope to build upon past successes and do what we can to exchange best naval practices for regional security and humanitarian assistance, and to ensure a bright future for further bilateral engagements like this, said Commander Bradley Coletti, commanding officer of the USS Comstock.
Approximately 325 U.S. Sailors and Marines joined 175 participants from the Sri Lankan Navy and Marine Corps as part of this exchange. U.S. Marines embarked aboard the USS Comstock helped introduce the latest tactics and equipment for the Sri Lanka Marine Corps, including life-saving skills; convoy operations; humanitarian assistance and disaster relief training; and amphibious vehicle familiarization.

During the visit, the Sailors and Marines of the USS Comstock and embarked 11th Marine Expeditionary Unit (MEU) also experienced the rich cultural sites of Sri Lanka. In addition, military personnel joined members of the U.S. Embassy to donate toys and renovate childrens dormitories at the Ceylon School for the Deaf and Blind in Ratmalana.

We are grateful to all of the Sailors and Marines for spending a few days helping hearing-impaired Sri Lankan students at the Ceylon School, said Ambassador Keshap.

USS Comstock, assigned to the Makin Island Amphibious Ready Group, and embarked 11th MEU are on scheduled deployment to the U.S. 7th Fleet and 5th Fleet area of responsibilities.

Hambantota Port: Govt. to include a new condition
	
The Government has decided to include a fresh condition to the agreement it intends signing with China Harbour Ltd on the management of the Hambantota Port.
The Governments stake is expected to increase to 40 per cent, after ten years from the date of signing this agreement. Under the earlier agreement, the government was to own a 30 per cent stake.
The government has arrived at this decision after estimating the amount it was hoping to receive from debt to equity swap, sources said.
Although arrangements are being finalized to sign the agreement with the China Harbour, the economic affairs committee appointed to deal with the matter will meet President Maithripala Sirisena to brief him about the latest developments. (Yohan Perera)

Imported vehicle prices likely to increase: VIASL
	
The prices of imported vehicles is likely to increase because of the increase in the exchange rates, especially the Japanese Yen, Vehicle Importers' Association of Sri Lanka (VIASL) said yesterday.
VIASL Chairman Dinesh Senanayake said the selling rate of a Japanese Yen is Rs.1/40.
Therefore, a vehicle worth Rs.5 million will be increased by Rs.200,000. This will only effect future vehicle imports, he said. (Chaturanga Pradeep)

Influenza virus a normal condition: DGHS
	
The influenza virus experienced by many people recently was a normal condition and it could be cured by following the doctors prescriptions, Director General of Health Services (DGHS) Dr. Jayasundara Bandara said yesterday.
Dr. Bandara told a news conference that the continuous climate changes were the main reason for the spread of the virus, since the nature of the viruses were also subjected to changes with the climate.
There is nothing to be worried about this condition. It is a common virus. It is necessary to avoid the contact of patients who have been infected with the virus in order to be safe. The Healthy Ministry has taken measures to prevent the effect of this virus, he said.
He said the ministry has launched special investigations to check on migrants arriving in the country at the Bandaranaike International Airport (BIA) to detect those affected by the virus.
He said all hospitals have been provided with the necessary medicines to cure this virus and added that they were transferring the blood samples received by them to the Medical Research Institute (MRI) for further medical tests.
Earlier we received patients who were affected with the virus from Kandy, Kilinochchci and Bibile areas. The MRI has received about 1548 samples for tests during March, and it was found that 528 were affected by the virus, he said.

Israel to recommence settlement building in West Bank
	
(Daily Mail, London), 31 March 2017 - Israels security cabinet on Thursday approved the building of the first new settlement in the occupied West Bank in nearly two decades, even as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu negotiates with Washington on a possible curb on settlement activity. 
The unanimous vote in favor of construction of the new settlement in an area called Emek Shilo came after Netanyahu earlier told reporters: I made a promise that we would establish a new settlement ... We will keep it today. 
The result of the vote was announced in a government statement. 
Palestinian officials swiftly condemned the move. 
Todays announcement once again proves that Israel is more committed to appeasing its illegal settler population than to abiding by the requirements for stability and a just peace, said Hanan Ashrawi, an executive committee member of the Palestine Liberation Organization. 

There was no immediate reaction from US President Donald Trumps administration, which is in discussions with Israel on limiting the construction of settlements on land Palestinians seek for a state.

Rupee rises on inward remittances, exporter dollar sales
	
REUTERS: The Sri Lankan rupee ended stronger yesterday, helped by inward remittances and selling of the greenback by exporters ahead of the festival season, but the gains were capped by dollar demand from a foreign bank in late trade, dealers said.
Rupee forwards were active, with two-week forwards ending at 152.45/50 per dollar, compared with Thursdays close of 152.55/65.
There were a lot of conversions by exporters maybe to pay the salaries and bonuses. The (inward) remittance flow was also high, said a currency dealer who did not wish to be named.
In the latter part of the day a foreign bank bought dollars, maybe for repatriation of corporate profits due to the end of the quarter.
The rupee has been under pressure due to dollar demand to meet increased seasonal imports ahead of the traditional New Year that is celebrated on April 13-14, dealers said.
The Central Bank on Monday raised the spot rupee reference rate by 10 cents to 151.70. It had raised the reference rate by 25 cents on March 20.
The Central Bank raised interest rates for the first time in eight months on March 24, saying tighter policy was a precaution against a build-up of inflationary pressures.
Analysts said the rate hike, a move that was also aimed at easing pressure on the rupee, could help stabilise the domestic currency that has been hurt by rising imports and outflows due to rupee bond sales by foreign investors.
Foreign investors net bought government securities worth Rs. 70 million ($461,285) in the week ended March 22, but they have net sold Rs. 63.2 billion of such instruments so far this year.

The Working Mechanism
	

Travelling to my work place from home is by train. In the past couple of months, I have heard many passengers having lengthy conversation in respect of the Central Bank Bond issue. Hence I had an idea of penning down few lines in basics how it works. 

Origins of Bonds
Bonds originated in Italy, where the city states, often at war with another, would force their wealthier citizens to lend them certain amounts in exchange for regular interest payments. British Government was issuing a Variety of Sovereign Bond the earliest - The Ton-tine, and the most popular Consol. During the first half of 19th century, Nathan Rothschild became one of the worlds richest men and arguably the most powerful banker by actively being in the bond market throughout Europe. 
A few financial institutions, taking the opportunity from the window provided by the Government has already raised and others planning to raise funds from the International Bond Market as well as the local. Although this system prevailed in the global financial market, this is a new avenue for the Sri Lankan financial market when raising funds.  Bond markets where companies and governments raise money are far less renowned and understood than their equity counterpart, the stock market. Yet in many respects can be more important and influential. By determining whether a country could cheaply raise liquidly or not, the bond markets have helped to determine the course of wars revolutions and political struggles, and had far reaching implications in almost every corner of life for centuries. Even during time of peace the ability of a government to raise money is of massive importance to a countrys Citizens. The higher the interest rates it has to pay, the higher are the borrowing cost all the way across the economy. So ignore the bond market at your peril. The price of sovereign bonds (see chart 1) reveals how creditworthy a government is, how easy it finds it raise cash, and how its policies are regarded. If a country no longer able to tap the bond market it will struggle to survive at all.


What is a Bond
A Bond is essentially a type of IOU which promises to pay the owner a certain lump sum at a point in future, as well as a stream of interest payments throughout bonds life usually at annual intervals. A typical government bond, for say U$ 100,000 will last for any thing like one to ten years, and will pay a nominal, in other words face value, interest rate fixed at around 4.5 percent. Once the bonds have been issued, they can be traded on the massive international bond markets. (Availability of bond markets) as Sri Lankan Bonds this can be traded in our secondary market. 

The Rate
The real power of bond markets lies in the fact that the interest rate the market determines for the bond can be quite different from that advertised on the bond itself. If investors believe a country is (1) at risk of defaulting or (2) likely to push up inflation (which in many senses is also a kind of default, since inflation erodes value). They will tend to sell off the bond which has the twin effect pushing down the price of the bond and pushing up the actual rate of interest it pays out. 
This make economic sense the riskier an asset is, the less investor should pay for it, and the greater should be the compensation for holding it (the interest rate). To have an idea on the above consider this simple example, suppose there is a U$ 10,000 Treasury bond with a 4.5% interest rate (also known as yield) for a duration of 10 years. It will pay out US 450 to its share holders each year for any one who buys this in the market which offers a price this represent a 4.5% interest rate. But what happens if inventors get jittery about the creditworthiness of that particular country and starts selling their bonds. The price drops to U$ 9000 at this price U$ 450 yield in actually 5 percent to the new investor. 
Hence the market rate of bond is highly important since it influences the rates at which a government can issue future bonds and still hope to find his buyers. If it is to get buyers as an when bonds are issued it must adapt the initial interest rates (coupon rate) to the market rate of the existing bonds the higher the rates it has to pay, the harder it becomes to borrow and the more it is forced to cut back. Not only Sri Lanka, other governments throughout the globe have to borrow in order to keep their budgets balanced items they are regularly issuing new bonds. 

Ratings - A A to C Ratings
Bonds issued by a Company or a Country are regarded as a safest investments available. When the issuing Country or the Company collapses, the bond holders are closest to see front to get their investment paid back. However the possibility of default is a key consideration for investors, to be on the safe side investors look for the ratings of top agencies such as Standard & Poors Moodys and Fitch. These ratings range from A A A, the best quality to C. Typically bonds rated a B A A or above are regarded as investment grade. 


The Yield Curve
Perhaps the most telling sign of the Bond markets importance is the fact that the way bonds behave can provide excellent clues about the future of the economy. The yield curve simply measures the interest rates on a variety of different governments bonds over time. All other things being equal, interest rates for bonds due to expire shortly should be lower than those which expire in a number of years - this reflects the fact that the economy is slowly to grow in the future, and the inflation will rise. 
Occasionally, however, the yield of curve becomes inverted, meaning that to interest rate on bonds which expires soonest are higher than those expiring in the future years. This is fairly a reliable sign that the economy is heading for a recession, since it implies interest rates and inflation will fall in the coming years. Couple of phenomena usually associated with economy slump. It is another example of how everyones economic fate in inextricably tied into state of the bond market.
