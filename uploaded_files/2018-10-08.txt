A Trilogy in Colour
	
?
Famous Russian painter Wassily Kandinsky once said: ?There is no must in Art because Art is free.?
This could be experienced at an event that has been organized to experience the freedom of art, Trilogy - an art exhibition which opens today and will go on till October 13 at the J.D.A Perera Art Gallery at Colombo 07.
The exhibition brings together the creative energy of three artists-B. Sarath Gunasiri Perera, R.M. Dharmasena and Santos Arzu, who belong to the school of Figurative Abstract Expressionism.
Figurative Abstract Expressionism is a form of art which broke the convention of painting in the backdrop of WWII, in the United States.
This deeply expressive art form champions a two-way approach, gestural application of paint and large areas of colour compositions in all media on large canvases, using shapes, symbols and colours.
Artist Sarath Gunasiri Perera is a senior lecturer at the Department of Painting of the Faculty of Visual Arts at the University of Visual and Performing Arts. He is also the President of the Visual Arts Panel of the Arts Council of Sri Lanka.
Artist R.M Dharmasena is a retired senior lecturer of the University of the Visual & Performing Arts. Santos Arzu Quioto is a Latin American artist from Honduras.Trilogy is a rare instance when art enthusiasts have the opportunity to meet the art teacher (R.M Dharmasena) and the student (Sarath Gunasiri Perera) both in the exhibition with another skilled artist, Santos Arzu.
Artist Sarath said he and Honduran artist Santos first met at an exhibition held in Korea, where they became friends.
Later with their friendship evolving, an idea to organize an exhibition together turned up and Trilogy was born.
Referring to the exhibition, Mr Dharmasena said they organized the exhibition after a five-year break during which they had done many experiments with their medium.
He said he had done 12 paintings following the theme Creative Landscapes.?
?Being a true artist means travelling through an endless route of learning. Every artist should follow this route of learning, growth and evolving. Artists should never paint or have exhibitions to please society or to imitate others who are doing exhibitions often.
?An exhibition is an intersection where you practise what you have learned throughout the journey. Never make it a competition with others in the field,??
he said.

## Title: Archbishop, Mangala and HR in Buddhism

Archbishop, Mangala and HR in Buddhism
	
?
WHY IMPROPER REMARKS: ?NEO - LIBERAL HR MANIA? AND ?CARDINAL TRYING TO BE A POPULIST?
?
very citizen has a role to play in supporting and promoting social justice. In Sigalowada Sutta? the Buddha enlightens us very clearly on the roles as reciprocal? obligations existing between Monarch [ruler] and Subjects, husband and? wife; parents and children; teachers and pupils; employer and employee;? friends, relatives and neighbours; clergy and laity, without leaving out? anybody. The writer is no authority on Buddhism, but the greatness in? these values here is, they are considered as sacred duties and are? reciprocal. If observed - they cover the entire UN Declaration of Human Rights 1948,? pronounced in the charter [Fundamental contributory events in history? were condensed into a single cause in drafting the Human Rights? Charter].? ?
They can form a peaceful, just, and harmonious culture and? civilization universally if effectively employed and practised. What the? leader of the Sri Lankan Catholic Church, His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith said in Sinhala, at a morning service at the Ekala Church? could be generally translated as, ?If we practise religion properly,? there is no need to talk about human rights. The newest religion in the? West is called human rights. It was discovered very recently. Our people? began practising religions centuries ago. They regard it as an amazing? new finding which is being held up and we are being persistently spoken to about it. Human life is not just eating and drinking and the search for? comfort. Western societies regard religion as a superficial outfit. If? we adhere to religious teachings, we don?t require human rights. He? added,? ?A Society which attempts to make Human Rights a Religion could safeguard Human Rights effectively through Buddhist teachings.?Those? who have no religion are dependent on human rights. We must not be? hoodwinked by these ?illusions and fantasies?., but should act? prudently. We must look at this sharply.?? ?
Cardinal on value of Buddhist Teachings
The Cardinal?s statement on ?value of Buddhist teachings?? has provoked anger in some religious fanatics. One of them wrote, ??the? Catholics are becoming defenders of the Buddhist Politicians.? Minister? of Finance and Mass Media, [perhaps a scientific allocation of jobs]? has condemned the comments made by Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith. Mangala Samaraweera?s? impolite vocabulary and offensive thought he twittered, ?The need for? human rights was an outcome of the marauding religious zealots of the? inquisition and the crusades where non-believers were massacred en bloc.? Pity the Cardinal always seems to get things wrong in trying to be a? populist.? The human rights lawyers also have criticized the sentiments? strongly, accusing the Cardinal of devaluing the importance of HR and? being uninformed of its idea.? ? ??
Are all men born equal? In some respects, yes. In several? other respects, no one is born equal to any other. Our wrong attitude? towards this concept has given rise to all sorts of problems, at social? level to the spiritual. Buddha?s numerous preaching on the denial of the? caste of the ancient Indian societies, and his stress on the parity of? people of all classes before the rule of Karma and, in the end, under the rules of the Dharma support the above.? ?
Buddhism, Hinduism and Harijans
Buddhist assertions of human rights was practiced in India five decades ago when famous Hindu scholar B. R. Ambedkar,? after years of struggle for the basic human rights of his clan, was compelled to recognize that there was no purpose in continuing his? efforts before he decided to convert some four million Harijans [community traditionally considered so called [?Untouchable?] to Buddhism. Ambedkar had well thought-out switching to Sikhism, but had to admit the fact that only Buddhism and Christianity are free of such discriminatory tenets or practices.? ?
Freedom is certainly the spirit of Buddhism, as will be? seen. Buddhism cannot be presented as another alternative ?ism or a? complement to other schools of thought, like ? Socialism, democracy,? Marxism, communism, neo-liberalism, liberal democracy, or any another? political notion or idea that are engaged in the basic struggle for? establishment of democracy and human rights. As with the human heart,? the concept of human rights demands rinsing out of all the narrow and? tribal prejudices out of the mind so as to be able to stop to do evil? and to attempt to do good - Buddhism is concerned with this basic? problem. Buddha Dhamma says, all men are equal and that they are all subject to the law of nature with no discrimination. The law of Karma is? applicable on everyone. To attain perfection, man has to develop? himself morally, physically, and intellectually. By this law, it? requires that person should be let free.? ?
Dharma resolves not just ?what one is due to do? but also ?what is due to one.? Through X?s performance of his Dharmic duty Y receives that which is his ?due?. Since Dharma decides? the duties of husband and the duties of wife. If the husband has an? obligation to support his wife, the wife has a ?right? to support from? husband. It is the duty of a king (ruler) to bestow justice without? bias, then citizens may be said to have a ?right? to just and? unprejudiced treatment before justice.? ?
In conclusion it should be that the notion of rights which is contained in Buddha Dhamma? is based on understanding of what is ?due? among and between? individuals. Kings and subjects, husbands and wives, teachers and? students, all have mutual obligations under Dhamma, which can be evaluated into duties and rights. We must emphasize that this conclusion, that the necessities of Dharma? are spoken in the form of duties and not as rights. Buddhism is far? from unique in the above respect, and a similar observation could be? made on other religions as well. It does not in any way mean that the? concept of rights is ?alien? to Buddha or that Buddhism rejects that individuals have ?rights.?? ?
There are Buddhists who are hesitant to see the dhamma under human rights because the exact comparable to the phrase ?HR? in? the Western sense is not found in Buddhist literature. The Western? notion of human rights confines to humans. In contrast, in Buddhism a human being is a much broader trans-homocentric: In Buddhism human? beings are considered as a part of all conscious beings and as a part of? entirety, because both human and animal beings are similarly subject to? temporariness or impermanence.? ?
Can people live by religions alone?
According to His Eminence Cardinal Malcolm Ranjith,? human rights is a new western religion that came recently, which is? meant for those without a religion. Those who believe in religion don?t? need to talk about human rights. Cardinal draws the attention of people? to the decline of individual qualities in Western nations where atheism? ?replaces religion. He is right that religion is more important for? human progress than human rights. But laws are a must to restrain people? doing deceitful anti-religious actions or deeds to hurt fellow? citizens. Can people live by religions alone???
Human Rights is the latest Religion?
The head of the Sri Lanka?s Catholic church says that Human? Rights are the latest Religion introduced by the West, some people? believe ?Human Rights, is a Secular Concept?. Human Rights like in? religion are about Human beings. Human Rights and Religion are two sides of the same coin, they are very closely related although they seem? different.
He says, ?if we practise religion properly, there is no need to talk about Human rights.? But the Human Rights Law of UN and its Charter of Fundamental Rights and ICJ have? provided an efficient and useful service to the human kind, especially? by curbing undemocratic actions of rulers and individuals who are not so? religious and who wield power on powerless.? ?
What is imperative here is to ensure that the western? domineering forces are kept at bay from abusing such charters, like HR? for their own benefit by attempting to enforce neo-colonial strategies? on third world.??
Religious leaders on the other hand should focus on? enlightening their followers and political authority on the importance? of respecting the rights of fellow citizens based on respective? religious values.? ?

## Title: JLL Lanka hails deregulation of real estate market as boost for foreign investment

JLL Lanka hails deregulation of real estate market as boost for foreign investment
	
Steven Mayes, Managing Director, JLL Lanka
Real estate consultancy JLL Lanka this week commended the passing of recent legislation pertaining to foreign ownership of land in Sri Lanka, noting that the move will provide a much-needed boost to investor confidence. JLL refers to the amendment to Section 3 of the Land (Restriction on Alienation) Act No 38 of 2014, which was certified on 30 July.?
The amendment enables foreign companies to acquire and hold freehold land in Sri Lanka, so long as that entity is listed on the Colombo Stock Exchange- thereby lifting the previous restriction prohibiting the transfer of freehold land to a foreign company exceeding the maximum permitted holding of 49% foreign shareholding. The renewed act No. 21 of 2018 (published on 3 August 2018) retrospectively comes into effect for land transfers after 1 April 2018, and removes the restriction for foreign nationals owning condominium real estate below the 4th floor of a building.?
JLL notes that this relatively minor adjustment is unlikely to have a significant impact in urban areas such as Colombo but could prove to be a major attraction for foreign investors looking to buy dream condominium homes in coastal areas (where low rise residential projects have previously been limited to tree top height). Shrewd developers will acknowledge the powerful combination of improved access via the Hambantota Expressway extension and lifted restrictions; such intuition is already in evidence with projects such as Serenia Residences and Tamba Villas- both in Talpe near Galle.?
The key development is the removal of the 49% foreign shareholding restriction, which had long been lobbied for by the capital markets and real estate sectors. This restriction was widely viewed as a barrier to foreign direct investment and an unreasonable constraint on companies that exceeded the 49% limit.?
JLL Lanka Managing Director, Steven Mayes, noted that almost all business conglomerates in Sri Lanka have ventured into real estate- thus this move is likely to increase market capitalization and liquidity in the Colombo Stock Exchange. For context; the value of foreign holdings of listed shares, has declined from Rs 860 billion a year ago to around Rs 760 billion today. Planned government divestment of non-core commercial assets such as the Hilton and Grand Hyatt hotels should also be impacted positively as the move has made transferring technical competence and capital and accessing Sri Lankan markets a much more transparent process. Another beneficiary of improved access to foreign capital will be the soon to be launched Colombo Port City. It is estimated that in addition to the USD 1.5 billion already invested in the Port City by the China Harbour Engineering Company, another USD 15 billion will be required to develop a built up area of (projected) 5.65 million square meters.
Mayes also added that previously, best in class regional and global development companies were dissuaded from taking controlling stakes in projects and companies due to the 49% restriction- ?but now the brakes are off, so to speak. We expect renewed appetite for these ventures by international stakeholders.??

Lankan arrested in Korea over oil storage tank fire
	
The Korean police today arrested a Sri Lankan national in its probe of a recent explosion at a local oil storage facility, the Korea Herald reported.
The arrest came one day after an explosion at the oil storage facility in Goyang, just north of Seoul, consumed a large storage tank with 2.66 million liters of gasoline, enough to fill 250 tank trucks.
The police said the 27-year-old Sri Lankan is believed to have accidentally caused the fire by releasing a sky lantern in the vicinity of the oil storage facility.
The police believe the sky lantern may have started the fire when it fell on the lawn of the oil storage facility, causing flames that later spread into the ventilation system of the oil tank, causing the explosion.
The 27-year-old is said to be a construction worker currently working at a site near the facility.

Lies, laughter and threats at the UNGA - EDITORIAL
	
n September 26, 1960, Cuban leader Fidel Castro addressed the United Nations General Assembly and held the General Assembly?s attention for almost five hours.
However, the most significant thing of Castro?s words before the UN was not the length of his speech, but his attack against the philosophy of war, his denunciation of US actions against the Cuban Revolution, and the use of force through the growing arms race. His speech provoked ovations and applause.
Castro critiqued war being used to monopolize underdeveloped countries and steal their resources, attacked US policy toward Cuba and other nations in Latin America, Asia and Africa. ?From the beginning of human history? he said, wars have arisen, fundamentally, for one reason some people?s desire to deprive others of their riches.?
Let the philosophy of plunder disappear, and the philosophy of war will have disappeared,? he said. He showed how the arms race was used by big business monopolies and likened them to crows? ?feeding on corpses brought by war.? On the 50th anniversary of the United Nations, in 1995, the leader of the Cuban Revolution returned to visit the UN headquarters. His speech was again appreciated with loud applause.
?We demand a world without ruthless blockades that cause the deaths of men, women and children as silent atomic bombs,? he said, referring -among others- to the economic, commercial and financial siege imposed on Cuba by the United States in 1962.
Twenty-three years later, on September 25, 2018, the 72-year-old US President Donald Trump- kept state leaders waiting when arrived late to address the 73rd sessions of the General Assembly of the United Nations.
Unfortunately, unlike Castro whose speech drew rounds of applause, the US leader drew derisive laughter at the General Assembly and the world over when he opened his speech crowing about how much he had ?achieved? in the US since he became President. Poor Mr. Trump forgot he was addressing a world body and not a band of? political supporters. He crowed of how he had unilaterally pulled out of the 2015 Iran Nuclear Deal, (an international agreement), charging Iran had not kept to the terms of the agreement, Trump launched a campaign of economic pressure and sanctions against that country.But the UN watchdog committee International Atomic Energy Agency emphatically dismissed the charge.??
Trump also demanded all nations isolate the Iran?s regime and threatened? to sanction countries that did not fall in line. He boasted he would bring reconciliation between Palestine and Israel. Instead he stopped US funding -amounting to $350 million- to the United Nations Relief and Works Agency in the Near East for Palestine Refugees, which helps maintain refugee camps to over 5,000,000 Palestinian refugees displaced by Israeli attacks on Palestinian territories.
He spoke in glowing terms of the generosity of the UAE, Saudi Arabia, and Qatar who he said, ?have pledged billions of dollars to aid the people of Yemen?. Blissfully ignoring the fact that these three countries are even today continue to? impose a military blockade of Yemen and frequently bomb civillian targets in that country.?
The resulting hunger and malnutrition in that country, has been described by the UN itself as a humanitarian disaster. Not unexpectedly, Trump received derisive laughter from state leaders and delegates at the General Assembly. Leaders of Russia, China, France, Germany and Britain too have rejected Trump?s call to sanction Iran.?
But it was our neighbour India who showed the US,India was no vassal state, in the aftermath of Trump?s threatened sanction against India - under the Countering America?s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act (CAATSA) - for seeking to purchase weapons from Russia.
On Saturday, India signed a $5 billion deal with Russia for S-400 Triumf missile shield systems at summit talks between Premier Modi and President Putin.New Delhi also categorically stated it would continue to import oil from Iran. A slap in the face of the man who ridiculed Modi by referring to him as the ?little tariff man?.
Trump?s boorish behaviour and confrontational policies are forcing even perennial US allies to realise the US is no longer a reliable ally. The US unilateral sanctions imposed against particular states and threats of repercussion against countries not willing to fall in line with US demands is unacceptable.??
Ultimately, the US and Trump will learn that the world can make do without US goods and services. But the US needs the worlds markets for its own produce.

## Title: ?NO?  to health insurance and creeping privatization
## Section: Opinion

?NO?  to health insurance and creeping privatization
	
?
Health insurance is rapidly breaking into Sri Lanka?s health sector. Last year, the government introduced ?Suraksha,? a publicly-financed health insurance scheme to reimburse the (private) healthcare expenses of all school-goers. The government has pledged to double Suraksha?s health benefits in its second year. Various private insurance companies are competing to gain a foothold in the health insurance market. There was news of an insurance provider?s ?Health Protector? scheme, offering coverage up to Rs. 20 million with cashless benefits in hospitals across the world. A few weeks ago, another private insurance concern unveiled its exclusive scheme, ?Premier Health Benefit,? promising a similar package with Rs. 50 million coverage.? ?
?
What is health insurance??
Health insurance is essentially a way to finance healthcare. The financial ?risk? associated with ill health is shared among a group of people who purchase a specific health insurance plan. Individual dues or premiums (the monthly/annual rate for the plan) may be paid for by governments, employers, or individuals. Using the premiums, the insurer covers the costs of healthcare services for those who experience ill health (not all those insured will fall ill, hence the ?risk? of ill health is ?shared? within the group). Payments by the insurer (reimbursements) are made either directly to healthcare providers or to users who have paid out-of-pocket for the service, at the point of use.? ?
A key feature of health insurance is that it separates purchasing and provision in a health system. The insurer ?purchases? services for the insured from selected healthcare ?providers.? While the ?purchaser-provider split? enables governments to entrust purchasing and/or provision to private entities, this separation is believed to improve cost-effectiveness as (private) providers compete for insured clients, keeping quality high and costs low. However, information asymmetries and ?market failures? result in higher cost private services that are often of questionable quality, especially where regulation is weak.? ?
?
Undoing ?free health?
According to the Institute for Health Policy, in 2015, 54% of Sri Lanka?s health spending came from private sources, and, of this, about 85% was paid out-of-pocket ? a major concern for policymakers and, of course, the public. Of the remaining 15%, employers contributed about 5-8% in claims and medical benefits, and 2-3% was accounted for by the non-profit sector. The outstanding 5% came from health insurance. Although this proportion may not seem substantial, the health insurance contribution to private financing has risen from 1% in 1990, to 5% at present, suggesting that it is a growing industry. This 2015 estimate is likely to climb further as numerous schemes have been/are being rolled out, even as health insurance is presented as the solution to the crisis of out-of-pocket spending in the health sector.? ?
The publicly-financed Suraksha scheme, introduced last year, covers all students between the ages of 5 and 19 years, with benefits of up to Rs. 200,000 for hospitalization (Rs. 100,000 maximum per admission, including Rs. 1000 per day for admission in a state hospital plus Rs. 10,000 for drugs/tests not provided at the state hospital), Rs.10, 000 for outpatient services (for specified chronic illnesses), and some accident/disability cover. Here, the government purchases premiums from the insurer, Sri Lanka Insurance Corporation, which reimburses parents for claims on out-of-pocket expenses and other benefits. While this may look good on paper, schemes like Suraksha would be pointless in the absence of the public healthcare system.? ?
?
"A key feature of health insurance is that it separates purchasing and provision in a health system. The insurer ?purchases? services for the insured from selected healthcare ?providers"
In the ?free? public healthcare system, the government is both ?purchaser? and ?provider.? Without market-oriented profit- and rent-seeking, the government is able to control the costs associated with delivering healthcare. Moreover, on entering a state facility, the care received does not depend on an insurance plan that dictates which services will be covered, to what extent, and for whom. Instead, users access (available) services with no charges at the point of use. In addition, the public system delivers an expansive range of preventive health services (contrasting with health insurance, which tends to focus on more profitable hospital-based services).?
?
Universality and comprehensiveness
As a targeted health insurance scheme for school-goers, Suraksha does well on universality because it covers the entire school population, although comprehensiveness is restricted by annual limits on claims. The reason SLIC offers ?universal coverage? to students is because this age group is generally healthy and account for fewer hospital admissions. When the probability of ill health is greater, health insurance companies place limits on eligibility and claims. For example, a private insurance company?s Health Protector Scheme may be purchased only by those below 61 years and does not provide coverage beyond 70 years. Moreover, ?worldwide? coverage is limited to 250 surgeries and 37 critical illnesses. If the illness experienced is not among those listed, the user must either pay out-of-pocket or rely on public healthcare.? ?Health insurance also comes with out-of-pocket payments in the form of ?cost-sharing.? While premiums may (or not) be covered by governments and/or employers, users may be subjected to co-payments (a flat amount that the user must pay per service or item), coinsurance (a percentage of the charge that the user must pay) and/or deductibles (an amount the user must pay before coverage begins). While these payments are thought to prevent users from ?abusing? services, some health systems include protective mechanisms that exempt or limit cost-sharing based on income and other factors.??
For debt-ridden governments under World Bank and IMF pressures, like Sri Lanka, shifting to a health insurance-based system is appealing because it allows for cost-sharing, aligning with the stipulations and ideologies of international agencies.?
With Suraksha, however, the government has opted to cover the premium, impressing on the public that a health insurance-based system may be ?free? for all.? ?
?
Resisting infiltration?
Supported by the government, the health insurance industry is trying its best to expand its limited role in Sri Lanka. Suraksha was an ingenious strategy on the part of the government, literally brainwashing the younger generation into accepting an insurance-based system in favour of socialized medicine. As outlined in budget proposals of recent years, the government would also like to issue cost sheets to patients on discharge from the ?free? public system, perhaps to highlight the potential role of an insurer in ?purchasing? healthcare???
Meanwhile, the private health insurance industry is also using innovative strategies to expand markets. For instance, a private insurer launched its ?Healthiest Workplace Survey? to ?boost the low penetration levels? of health insurance in the country?s corporate sector (Daily Mirror,August 13, 2018).
?No doubt, the survey will reveal high levels of ill health among employees, and health insurance will be proposed as the solution rather than radical changes in lifestyle and working conditions.? ?
?
"According to the Institute for Health Policy, in 2015, 54% of Sri Lanka?s health spending came from private sources, and, of this, about 85% was paid out-of-pocket"
At this time when major health reforms are in the offing, we should ask ourselves what kind of a health system we envision for future generations. Should we endorse publicly-financed health insurance to pay for ?world class,? resource-intensive, hospital-based, private healthcare services (for the few with supplemental benefits via employers or individually purchased plans) or should we call for strengthening the ?free? public system that provides a semblance of equity, universality and comprehensiveness? If it is the latter, we really need to say ?NO? to spreading privatization through health insurance expansion.? ?

October 1st World Elders? day: Inhumanity in Human but Humanity in Animals
	
As stated by Rev. Fr. Augustine Fernando in his lengthy details in a local newspaper of Sept. 21, 2018, some human beings in the process of getting civilized and cultured through education, get enlightened and in addition to being lawful in public conduct, also become urbane, empathetic, refined and courteously formal, gracious, cordial, suave, sober and self denying for the safe of others.?
I, myself, being a retired public servant for 30 years and 84 years of age at present, my fundamental rights infringed, violated the Universal Declaration of Human?Rights, Protection of Elders? Rights, International Code of conduct for Public Officials and Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration Act No. 17 of 1981, Section 20 and Establishment Code and treated as ?Oxen? who is outlive the period of usefulness by public servants of the Ministry of Health, Human Rights Commission and Public Service Commission from 1984.?
My bitter experience from these public servants mentioned above made miserable who undervalue the life of the people, abuse their position, twist the truth of many a situation to create problems. They try every casuistry to be on the safe side, even contravening the law, who in the elevated authority resort to bring the law or stretch the law to the extreme to suit their ends and pretend to be socially and legally correct (the Ombudsman, the Late Justice Ranaraja stated that public servants are reluctant to admit their mistakes knowing very well of their mistakes (August 9, 2003). It is a sorry plight that there is no provision that violators of such protections are brought to book and inflict punishment on them for their violations and infringements.?
Humanity in Animal
During summer in the Chicago, a small boy went to the Brook Field Zoo, jumped over the wall and had accidentally fallen into the cave where the gorillas were kept.No one thought this boy would do so. The crowd was watching the situation in tense. The Security Officer Craig pulled the Alarm Signal 13 and all officers came rushing to the scene preparing? to flush water towards the gorillas. But there was no necessity whatsoever. The Gorilla, named Binti Jua, slowly approached the boy who was lying unconscious after the fall. All were seen shocked, Binti Jua chased away the fellow animals who were rushing to the scene on hearing the alarm to harm the boy, carried him like its own child, signalled Craig who was at the gate. Craig went near and Binti Jua handed over the boy to him and took all the gorillas back to the cave. The unconscious boy was given first aid and was saved.?
This was written by Jenifer Holandu in his book ?Unlikely Heroes? which is one of his surprising incidents out of 37. The writer says that animals always respect human beings but human beings do not respect them.

Tomorrow, October 9, is World Philatelic Day: Collecting history  in STAMPS
	
STAMPS MAY DIE OUT. BUT THAT WON?T MEAN THE EXTINCTION OF PHILATELIC SCIENCE, SAYS EXPERT COLLECTOR
?
?
ulshan Ellawela went to England in 2005 to work as an electronic engineer and returned to Sri Lanka as a philatelist so involved with that he has written two books on the subject.? ?
Philately remains esoteric to Sri Lankans even today because it is known to many as stamp collecting, a matter of children?s albums.? ?
Even adult collectors who indulge in the hobby remain ignorant of philately?s depth and each as a social science.? ?
While working as an electronic engineer in London, Dulshan Ellawela began collecting stamps and other philatelic items related to the colonial era (pre-independence Sri Lanka).? ?
While studying at Ananda College, Colombo, he began collecting stamps as a schoolboy hobby. As his knowledge of the subject grew, he realised that Victorian Era stamps are hard to find in Sri Lanka and expensive.? ?
In London, he began frequenting auctions and was able to buy Victorian Era philatelic items related to Sri Lanka at bargain prices. He discovered the highly valuable ?Dull Rose? stamp in one such lot. The Dull Rose is the? postage stamp that is considered to be the rarest and most valuable stamp issued in the country.
He found out that most of the ?British Ceylon? stamps were in the UK, not here. He began buying them as much as he could, with the intention of establishing a Victorian Era philatelic collection in Sri Lanka.? ?
Dulshan has first-class honours in engineering. But his hobby seems to take priority over everything else. Ceylon fiscal stamps are his pet research area (Revenue and telegraph stamps of the Queen Victoria era). These include foreign bills, stamp duties, judicial, warehouse warrants, Receipt stamps and telegraphs.? ?
There have been dire predictions that philately will die out in a changing world. But Dulshan sees the future differently.? ?
Digital technology may replace the postage stamp in the foreseeable future, in the same way, it is used to send parcels in the UK.? ?
?
"He found out that most of the ?British Ceylon? stamps were in the UK, not here. He began buying them as much as he could, with the intention of establishing a Victorian Era philatelic collection in Sri Lanka."
?
The process is as follows ? the weight is measured, the payment is made online, the bar code is printed and pasted on the parcel, which is then dropped into the depot or courier service; finally, at the sorting office the barcode is scanned and sent to the relevant area for distribution.? ?
The same thing can happen with the postage stamp. But that won?t mean the extinction of philatelic science. On the contrary, the adhesive postage stamp would become a sought-after collector?s item, giving the hobby a new boost.? ?
He is the author of two books in philately ? Ellawela?s Ceylon/Sri Lanka Stamp Catalogue (1857-1948) and The world?s first postage stamps issued in philatelic history. He is also a collector of Victorian memorabilia such as ceramics.? ?
The author says that the first and bigger book (Ellawela?s Ceylon/Sri Lanka Stamp Catalogue) is the first book of its kind published in Sri Lanka with correct colour variations, specimen stamps and Gutter Pairs. This book contains stamps from the Queen Victoria era (1857) to King George VI (1948).It contains too, some very rare specimen stamps and Ceylon Gutter pairs, altogether some 635 stamps from 1857 to 1947.
The author is offering to conduct free lectures on philately for schools.

UNP MP Thushara Indunil said today his party was not on panic mode over speculation of moves being made to form an interim government in the wake of discussions between President Maithripala Sirisena and former president Mahinda Rajapaksa.
He told a news briefing that instead his party would obtain the support of six SLFP MPs to form its own government in place of the current national unity government.
?We have 106 MPs and need the support of six more members to secure a majority in Parliament. Some SLFP members have expressed their willingness to join us if we decide to form our own government. We have already held several rounds of discussions with them and as such forming a UNP government is not much of a challenge,? the MP said.
?We don?t expect the President to join the 16 SLFP dissidents and the joint opposition members who abandoned him at the 2015 presidential election,? he said and challenged the JO and the 16 disidents to topple the government by defeating next month's 2019 Budget.
?If the JO is keen to topple the government, this will be a good opportunity to do so. We are confident that it is impossible for them to do so because of the internal rifts that are bugging the JO,? he said. (Sheain Fernandopulle)
