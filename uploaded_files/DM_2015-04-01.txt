Janashakthis motor insurance sets industry benchmark: Janashakthi COO
	
Falling fuel prices led to a significant increase in vehicle registrations in January, with 4,928 units being registered up from 4,311 in December and 1,958 units a year ago, a report from JB Securities said.
In the wake of this surge, purchasing a motor insurance policy tailored to your needs becomes vital. Those looking to purchase a motor insurance policy should always ensure that the vehicle is insured according to the correct prevailing market value and always remember to ask about policy conditions and benefits, said Janashakthi Insurance Chief Operating Officer Dayalanie Abeygunawardena.
It is also important to inform the insurance agents about the purpose an insured vehicle is being used for, as premiums and cover offered tend to vary. This in turn can lead to misunderstandings when making a claim, she added.
At Janashakthi, we aim to offer the best to our customers. We do this not just through superior service but also by offering advice, she said.
For instance, many customers are unaware of the documents necessary when signing up for an insurance policy. Third party insurance applicants need to bring only the vehicle registration, while for comprehensive insurance the vehicle registration book is a requisite along with the current and previous tax receipts if applicable. The vehicle is also inspected if it is a new insurance policy.
It is also important to know whom to call in the event of an accident or in an emergency. Janashakthi, for instance, has a 24-hour call centre, which is fully equipped with trained staff, who are geared to guide the customers for any situation, Dayalanie explained.
The innovative Full Option Locator App also allows customers to enter their vehicle or reference number to report an accident, with a dedicated customer care representative contacting them within a few minutes.
Customers also need to be aware of the types of claim settlements available. Janashakthi offers three options  rapid settlement, where the assessor estimates the damage on-site and communicates the amount to the customer, with claim settlement benchmarked at six hours. There is also cash in lieu settlement, where Janashakthis internal assessors evaluate the damage and provide an agreed amount upon discussion with the customer (with claim settlement benchmarked at 12 hours) and normal settlement, where customers raise a repair estimate, with claim settlement benchmarked within 24 hours. In all cases, the customers have to fulfil all the necessary requirements to qualify for the approved time frames. 
Janashakthi has further revolutionised claim settlement, with the introduction of its new Easy Claim service. A customer whose claim falls within the stipulated value need no longer visit one of Janashakthis branches to pick up a claim but can pick up the approved claim payment within 24 hours or less from the ATM, eliminating the need to stand in queues at the bank. 
Another vital point customers have to consider include the repair services insurance companies offer. Janashakthi facilitates to source spare parts and supply good quality spares to its customers thus expanding their value-added services. This service is offered free of charge to their customer base islandwide.
Janashakthi has consistently been a first mover in the motor segment, entering the market when others were hesitant to do so. Over the years, we have established ourselves in the segment not just through our product but through superior service. Our aim is to be the guiding partner to our customers, especially during their troubled times. Our most popular free vehicle scan services conducted islandwide at key locations is testament to our true understanding towards our customers, Dayalanie explained.
An Associate Member of the Chartered Insurance Institute, UK and a Chartered Insurer, Dayalanie also holds an MBA from Edith Cowan University, Australia and counts over 25 years experience in the insurance industry.

	The political circles these days are abuzz with the news that moves are afoot to arrest at least two Diyawanna members on serious charges and they are likely to be accommodated in a state-run lodge like the one at Welikada after being produced in courts.
One of these Diyawanna members hailing from Colombo is facing drug-related charges. The other one is facing a multitude of charges ranging from the commission of frauds and breaches of trust to operating illegal aviation services. He has been returned to Diyawanna from a district in the South.
They say that the legal authorities have given the nod for their arrest following establishing prima facies cases against them.
Meanwhile, another story doing the rounds says that the errant Diyawanna member from the South is set to betray a member of a leading political clan in the Deep South in a bid to escape from his present predicament.

Measures for passengers safety by CAA
	
	Following the incident of a Germanwings Airbus A320 co-pilot who allegedly locked the pilot out and then crashed the plane in the French Alps, the Civil Aviation Authority of Bandaranaike International Airport yesterday said it will require SriLankan airlines and Mihin Air always to have two authorised crew members in the cockpit.
	"When one of the pilots leave the cockpit, the pilot in charge will require a chief flight attendant to enter the cockpit and thus guarantee at all times that the door can be opened to allow entry," the Director General of Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), H.M.C.Nimalsiri said.
	He also said that a new set of safety standards as measures to be taken in an emergency had been included into the criteria followed by pilots and co-pilots.
	Medical checkups and training programmes for the airline staff had been focused thoroughly by the CAA and through the new standards, CAA hopes to ensure the safety of airline passengers.
	During the first three months of this year there have been four airline accidents around the world including TransAsia Airways flight 235 crash into a river killing 42 people, Delta Airlines flight 1086 skidding off and injuring over a dozen of people, Air Canada flight 624 hit the power lines leaving 23 people injured and the Germanwings flight 9525 crash killing 150 people on board.(Piyumi Fonseka)

Once bitten twice shy!
	
	
	This one is a main character in the opposition. Now that he is raised to a next high status in the opposition, he is more ebullient than ever before.
 A Romeo from his young days, his cupidity has not waned with age. This bigwig recently received an invitation to lunch from a party politico from a city suburb. And he readily accepted it. He called at the residence of the host at the appointed time carrying a heavy package containing an assortment of expensive cosmetics and perfumery as well as delicious chocolate bars. Like a gallant knight figuring as the hero in tales of romance, the opposition bigwig first presented a symbolic red rose flower and next the gift package to a beaming hostess  the wife of the politico.
The hostess, a charming and comely young lady, cottoned on to the intention behind the expensive gifts. But she hid her discomfiture behind a welcome smile and played the ideal hostess.
A few days later, the opposition heavyweight called the same host and expressed his wish to call at his residence.
The politico who had to be in the good books of the opposition bigwig for his political survival told the latter: You are quite welcome, Sir. Its an honor to have you as our guest!
The opposition bigwig called at the residence of the politico with a gift package as on the previous occasion. But this time round, only the host came forward to receive him.
In response to a quizzical look from a visibly dismayed guest, the host had to explain that his wife was sick and was confined to her bedroom!

	The track records of at least four Blue members of the group that crossed the floor of the Diyawanna House in a move towards forming a national government had set a poser to the government top brass.
The complaints lodged with the bribery and corruption authorities against the ones who were earlier in charge of foreign employment, Samurdhi, wildlife and telecommunications are far too serious for the authorities in the saddle to turn a blind eye, they say. Meanwhile, both anti-corruption and Police sleuths have begun wondering whether they should risk their necks by going ahead with the investigations into the allegations against these former bigwigs who are now restored to political power and glory they had been used to under the previous regime.
However, the anti-corruption authorities have now received orders from the top to make a public announcement assuring that the investigations into allegations against all political heavyweights irrespective of their former or present status are proceeding smoothly.

	This young politico  a scion of a well-known political family also lent his voice to the anti-corruption cry ahead of the last big poll and quit the then government following in the footsteps of the Compassionate One and was eventually elevated to a Ministerial level.
The father of this politico was once the virtual monarch of the area and his father- in-law is also a political heavyweight.
The Ministerial one was accorded a grand reception following his appointment to high office.
His office has just begun receiving the bills in respect of goods and services supplied in connection with this grand reception. The first bill received was the one for the milk rice supplied. And the accountants broke out in a sweat when they saw the amount billed, they say. It was well over Rs.100,000. After getting over the initial shock, the accountants had begun looking up the relevant financial regulations to check whether there is provision to settle such a high bill.
Meanwhile, the Ministerial one has pulled up the officials for delaying the payment, but the latter are in a funk about having anything to do with the bill.

Meanwhile, the construction work on a new office for the Ministerial one estimated to cost a massive amount is already underway. People will have to pray for divine intervention if this is the kind of yahapalanaya in practice elsewhere too under this regime, say the employees.

China agrees to write off US$ 30 M from OCR cost
	
	China had agreed to write off US$ 30 million from the total amount which it had lent to Sri Lanka for the construction of the Outer Circular Road (OCR) which connects several highways, the Sri Lankan Government announced today.
	The announcement was made by a group of ministers at a media news briefing held last evening. This had been communicated by the Chinese government during the visit of President Maithripala Sirisena to China recently.
	Minister of Health Dr Rajitha Senaratne said the project had been over-priced in order that politicians of the previous regime who negotiated the deal on behalf of the Sri Lankan Government would be left with a sizable commission. The amount which would be written off therefore is a part of a commission which was to go into someones pocket, he said. Responding to a question raised by journalists as to whether the reality is that no one obtained any commission out of the project physically although allegations were still been levelled at ministers of the previous regime, the minister said the usual procedure that was followed was that part of the commission was given as an advance.
	In addition Minister Senaratne said the Chinese Government had given a grant worth more than US$ 300 million to the health sector alone including Rs. 11.5 billion to set up a special hospital to treat kidney disease in Polonnaruwa. In addition he said a nine storied OPD unit for the Colombo National Hospital was also to be built with Chinese assistance.
	Justice Minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe, who was also present, revealed that the Chinese government had offered them a grant of Rs 4 billion to renovate the Supreme Courts Complex in Colombo. Minister of Urban Development Rauff Hakeem also offered his views and said the Chinese President had conveyed to President Sirisena his idea of setting up a Silk Route Fund through which Sri Lanka would also benefit.

A 20-foot container imported from China which contained shoes valued at more than Rs. 2 million had been seized by the Customs today, Sri Lanka Customs Spokesman Leslie Gamini said.
He said that the caontainer had been imported under forged documents. The raid was conducted by the Sri Lanka Customs Drug Prevention unit.
The consignment was imported from china on March 16 by an importer from the Kelaniya area and the goods were declared as Speakers and sanitary ware.
Officials said that they found 3,816 pairs of shoes in the container.
There may be a loss about Rs.1.8million tax revenue to the government if it had passed through, Gamini said.
However, the suspect had paid only Rs. 900,000 tax for the goods, he said.
A Cess of Rs. 500 levied for a pair of shoes. The government has implemented these Cess Levies for supporting local industries. Hence Sri Lanka Customs regularly conducts these types of detections for safeguarding the local industries, he said.
As per the instructions of K.D.R. Christy, Director of Customs and Parakrama Basnayake, Deputy Director of Customs, this detection was made by Nandanaath Gunawardane, Superintendant of Customs, S.R. Jayarathne, R.H.J. Somaweera, U.DJ. Monty, Asst. Superintendant of Customs and Nuwan Wijewardhana, Inspector of Customs. (Chaturanga Pradeep)Pix by Kushan Pathiraja

Emergency medical assistance services for ATL customers
	
As part of its promise to make insurance open to all, Amna Takaful (ATL) recently partnered with Falck Sri Lanka to provide its individual medical insurance policyholders with access to world-class emergency medical services (EMS). As part of the strategic partnership, all of Amna Takafuls Hale & Hearty and KruthaGuna policyholders will be entitled to free pre-hospital emergency care, provided by Falck Sri Lanka.
Based in Copenhagen, Denmark, Falck is the largest multinational ambulance service provider in the world, operating 1800 ambulances in 47 countries and responding to two million emergency calls each year. Falck is revolutionizing the healthcare system and the companys EMS has evolved from a simple system that merely provides emergency transportation to one that delivers timely transport combined with high-quality medical treatment and care throughout a patients journey to the hospital. Now all Hale & Hearty and KruthaGuna policyholders will be provided with added peace of mind, as they will have free access to emergency medical services in Colombo and its suburbs.
Commenting on the partnership Amna Takaful PLC Chief Executive Officer Fazal Ghaffoor stated, We are proud to partner Falck Sri Lanka as part of our ongoing effort to provide our customers with completely hassle-free insurance solutions. Our partnership with Falck is both new and unique in the industry and extends beyond merely providing a benefit, to meeting an important need in society.
Since a medical emergency requirement can occur at any time, this service will ensure that ATLs Hale & Hearty and KruthaGuna policyholders and their family members can benefit from Falck Sri Lankas high-quality EMS at any time, at zero cost.
Falck Sri Lanka Chief Executive Officer Jens Paul Madsen stated, Falck is truly honoured to partner with Amna Takaful, a renowned insurance provider in Sri Lanka. We value ATLs commitment to strengthening the medical insurance offering in Sri Lanka and this partnership will also play a crucial role in creating awareness about the importance of EMS. From our experience world over, we are of the view that pre-hospital emergency services have a lot of scope in Sri Lanka because they are able to deliver a high level of care to those in need.
Regardless of where they are in Colombo and its suburbs, now ATLs Hale & Hearty and KruthaGuna policyholders will have access to prompt and reliable emergency medical services. The ambulance services provided by Falck will ensure that policyholders are taken care of in their most critical time of need. It is widely recognized that most cases of injury are aggravated because of the manner in which injured patients are transported to hospitals.
As part of its vision to serve the entire Western Province by March 2015, Falck has expanded its services from a head office in Ratmalana to EMS stations in Nawala, Wattala and Negombo. The expansion allows Falck to be more accessible and provide timely care. Falck aims to respond to medical emergencies within Colombo and its immediate suburbs as well as Negombo within 15 minutes from when an emergency call is made.
Hale & Hearty is a unique hospitalization cover which is designed to suit the medical requirements of both individuals and families. Customers can select schemes that provide an annual cover of Rs.100,000 upwards per individual, based on their specific needs. Besides the standard benefits that are offered as part of the medical policy Hale & Hearty pays back the cost incurred due to the usage of an ambulance for hospitalization due to accidents or sickness. 
The policy also operates on a cashless claims settlement basis, so when facing unforeseen medical circumstances, policyholders can focus on obtaining proper care for themselves and their loved ones, whilst ATL attends to the financial burden. Additionally, policyholders can also benefit from cashless facilities at over 20 leading hospitals across Sri Lanka.
KruthaGuna is the only hospitalization scheme in Sri Lanka that is designed for senior citizens and covers pre-existing ailments (from the second year onwards). KruthaGuna policyholders are also provided with a special grant to purchase wheelchairs and fund their home nursing needs. The policy is offered on a reimbursement basis and customers can select from three schemes starting with an annual cover of Rs.100,000 per annum, per individual.

Champika more suitable for Presidency: Warnasinghe
	
Commenting on the reports that JHU General Secretary Champika Ranawaka was aspiring to become the Executive President and that was why he was against the 19th Amendment, JHU National Organiser Nishantha Sri Warnasinghe said Minister Ranawaka was more suitable for the Presidency than any of the others who were spreading rumours linking the minister and the presidency.
The JHU will decide when to field him as the President or whether to nominate him. It is a decision for the party to take, he said today.
He lashed out at Professor Nirmal Ranjith Dewasiri, author Gamini Viyangoda and the Janatha Vimukthi Peramuna for claiming that Minister Ranawaka was aspiring to become the Executive President in 2020 and that was why the JHU was against the 19th Amendment.

Gnanasara Thera questioned by police
	
Bodu Bala Sena (BBS) General Secretary Ven. Galagodaaththe Gnanasara Thera was yesterday questioned by the Buddha Sasana Ministrys special police unit set up to investigate religious disputes.
The Thera said he was asked to report to the special police unit last evening and give a statement on the remarks he had made at a news conference held on February 19 at the BBS Head Office in Kirulapana.
This is a move to tarnish my image and that of our organisation by some religious extremists, he told Daily Mirror.
However, special unit OIC M.P.D.I. Kulasekara said the questioning was a result of a complaint filed by five Muslims who had been disturbed and worried by the remarks made by the Thera. The remarks were posted on the BBS website.
The OIC said the men had initially filed a complaint against the Thera at the Kirulapana Police Station and statements had been recorded by them. (Piyumi Fonseka)

He is mulling his next move
	
	This Blue bigwig from the South was among those elevated to Ministerial level with the formation of the national government.
 Soon after being sworn in, he left Colombo for the South to attend a religious ceremony held in a Buddhist temple there. Incidentally the Chief Guest at the event was the deposed Big Boss. On his way to the temple ceremony, a crowd had jeered at him. And it was a highly perturbed Ministerial one who later sat next to his former boss when the ceremony got underway. They were making small talk, but the Ministerial one could not shake off an uneasy feeling bothering him ever since the unexpected unnerving incident. His former Boss who detected the gloom in his mood, remarked: You look upset over something. Arent you happy that you have got a Ministerial office
Sir, the portfolio I got is useless  its nothing compared to the one I held earlier. My present job is confined to overseeing the payment of salaries to the House staff, the Ministerial one said. He added as an afterthought: I am mulling my next move.
The ceremony over, both the new Ministerial one and his former boss called at the residence of the Nilame of Devinuwara Devalaya as the latters dinner guests. The gloomy feeling had weighed heavily on the Ministerial one even at the time they parted ways following the dinner, our sources say.

He scaled down the show to suit the office he got!
	
	A high-up in the new government from Uva summoned his active supporters in the district for a powwow at his residence a few days ahead of the swearing-in ceremony.
 He told them: I am getting a good portfolio at Cabinet level. So you people should arrange a grand reception for me on my return from the swearing- in ceremony. Hurrah! the supporters cried out in glee. We are going to put up cut-outs, banners and posters everywhere. We will turn the entire area into one big carnival. Well-heeled with funds from a generous master, the enthusiastic followers lost no time in buckling down to the task on hand.
Highly pleased with the pomp and fanfare organized by his faithful followers, the politico dressed in his Sunday best left for Colombo for the swearing-in. Once at the main secretariat, the politico found to his shock and dismay that he was billed to get only a deputy office. However, he soon resigned himself to the unforeseen situation deriving solace from the thought that something was better than nothing. Then he remembered the grand reception befitting a VIP of Cabinet rank organized by his followers. He immediately rang up the supporters who played a lead role in organizing the reception. Dismantle all pandals and cutouts, remove all banners, he told them.
The supporters who were working day and night to make the event a success, were taken aback by this order. Why do you want to send all our efforts down the drain Havent they given you what you expected they asked.
I am getting something  a deputy office and it is not worth making a big fuss about! was the politicos stock reply to them all.
