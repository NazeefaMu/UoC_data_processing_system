110 civil society groups align with UNFGG
	
	Some 110 civil society organisations and trade unions today signed a 14-point people?s pledge with the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) for a fair, democratic and people-friendly Constitution.
	Prime Minister and United National Party (UNP) Leader Ranil Wickremesinghe signed the agreement on behalf of the UNFGG under the patronage of National Movement for Social Justice Leader Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera, Ministers Karu Jayasooriya, Patali Champika Ranawaka and Rajitha Senarathne.
	Included in the pledge were constitutional amendments, the abolishing of the executive presidency and the establishment of parliamentary democracy through a reformed electoral system based on a mix of the first-past-the-post and the proportional representation systems in place of the preferential voting system.
	Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe, who addressed the gathering at the Sri Lanka Foundation Institute, said the country's current vibrant environment of peace, harmony and freedom will continue under the UNP government.
	?People are not even aware that an election is taking place in the country because of the unprecedented level of freedom in the country under our government,? Mr.Wickremesinghe said.
	Ven. Maduluwawe Sobhitha Thera said it was of no use trying to mend and patch up the existing constitution because the time was ripe for a new constitution to replace the version currently in operation.
	The organisations proposed for the implementation of independent commissions under the 19th Amendment and the setting up of the National Audit Bill and the Right to Information Act.
	They underscored the need for human rights in line with international human rights standards and the expansion and strengthening of civil, economic, political, cultural, social, women's and children's rights.
	The people?s pledge also called for national policies for all sectors and the establishment of reconciliation, acceleration of the ongoing investigations into financial crimes, bribery and corruption. (Piyumi Fonseka)

Lankan refugee sentenced to 20 years' jail for murder
	
	A man found guilty of the stabbing murder of a fellow Sri Lankan refugee in Adelaide's north has been jailed for at least 20 years.
	Ketheshwaran Sivaperuman, 35, bled to death after being stabbed once with a large kitchen knife at his Elizabeth South home in January last year.
	The Supreme Court heard his killer, Satheeswaran Suppiah, 31, stabbed Sivaperuman after a falling-out, in which Suppiah was called "a lady-boy".
	Suppiah was also a refugee from Sri Lanka.
	The men were neighbours at the time of the murder and the court heard at one stage the pair even lived together.
	About one month before the murder, the men "had a falling out", Justice David Lovell said.
	The court was previously told on the day of the murder, Suppiah had been drinking heavily, and had hidden the knife in his shorts before going to Sivaperuman's house.
	Suppiah had tried to blame another man for the crime.
	He said he only had the knife to cut apples, but another man grabbed his hand and forced the knife into the victim's stomach.
	The court was told Sivaperuman was stabbed in the abdomen with such force the blade damaged his spine and exposed his intestine.
	He suffered severe blood loss and died with minutes at the scene.
	After the stabbing Suppiah returned to his house and rang police and the ambulance.
	"One of the tragedies of this case is that you, Ketheshwaran (Sivaperuman) and witnesses to the murder fled to Australia to avoid violence and persecution," Justice Lovell said.
	"In a single moment on the 16th of January you simultaneously destroyed your own life, the life of Ketheshwaran (Sivaperuman) and the lives of people around him."
	A jury found Suppiah guilty of murder in May, but Justice Lovell said he had not accepted responsibility for the crime.
	"This was a savage and deliberate attack," Justice Lovell said.
	"There's no doubt in this case that you were significantly affected by alcohol."
	The victim's widow in Sri Lanka has received a small amount of compensation and assistance to repatriate the body.
	Suppiah has been sentenced to life with a non-parole period of 20 years, which is the minimum for murder.(ABC)

BOC among Top 5 in ?The Banker? rankings
	
		 		 
		 
			
Bank of Ceylon has created history by being ranked among the Top 5 banks in the Asia-Pacific Region (excluding China and Japan) in terms of Return on Capital by (ROC) ?The Banker? Magazine becoming the first Sri Lankan bank to achieve such a performance ranking from an internationally recognised entity.
This unique milestone comes as a kind of ?icing on the top? as Bank of Ceylon has yet again been ranked among the Top 1000 banks in the world, and with a country rank of No.1, ahead of all other Sri Lankan banks also by the same UK based ?The Banker? magazine.?
The story of Bank of Ceylon?s entry into the Top 1000 Banks in the World begins in 1997 when it entered the Top 1000. It was to take more than ten years before any other Sri Lankan bank could enter these leagues. By the year 2000 other local banks were being rated among the top 1000-2000 banks but with a rank close to the mid point of the 1000 to 2000 range. Bank of Ceylon continued to be ranked among the Top 1000 up to 2001.
By this time other banks in the region such as those in India, Indonesia, China and the rest of world were growing much faster than Sri Lankan banks which bore the burden of the ongoing conflict in the North and East. Bank of Ceylon re-emerged in 2012 and, as usual, ahead of all other Sri Lankan banks and has continued in the Top 1000 ever since.
With the aspiration to continue the legend Bank?s Chairman, President?s Counsel Ronald C. Perera stated ?Bank of Ceylon accepts these achievements of being able to strengthen banks presence among top 1000 Banks in the world with the No.1 country ranking despite the challenging global and local financial environment. At the same time this is the best moment to recall that BOC was the first Sri Lankan to be enlisted among top 1000 banks in the world. Being Bankers to the Nation, we consistently make sure that strength/ encouragement received from these achievements are passed down to deliver best-in-class banking service to our customers.?
?Bank of Ceylon has always been on a steadfast track to be exemplarily in the Sri Lankan banking industry. We have initiated several projects with Boston Consultancy Group (BCG) to transform the bank?s operations and processes to come up with more elegant and comfortable banking to delight our customers whilst providing the best ROI for our main stakeholder. Being recognized for our commitment shows that we are moving ahead in the right direction? stated Bank?s General Manager D.M. Gunasekara.?
BOC has also set an unrivalled record by becoming the only business to be the No.1 Brand in the country for seven consecutive years as ranked by Brand Finance Lanka, a subsidiary of Brand Finance network (UK). Bank of Ceylon?s brand value has increased significantly to Rs.38 billion in 2015 compared to Rs.31 billion in 2014.

## Title: Ceylinco Life promotes life insurance with new ?Supreme? policy

Ceylinco Life promotes life insurance with new ?Supreme? policy
	
		 		 
		 
			
An attractive new policy that will pay up to 50 percent of the basic sum assured in lump sums every four years without any diminution of the policyholder?s maturity entitlements has been launched by Ceylinco Life, sparking fresh interest in life insurance.
Branded ?Ceylinco Life Supreme,? the new policy offers comprehensive life cover, lump sum payments every four years, ?above average maturity value and optional rider covers for critical illness, hospitalization or major surgery.
It differs from other life insurance plans as it guarantees to pay the sum assured or the accumulated fund balance, whichever is higher, at maturity or in the event of premature death, with no deductions in respect of the lump sum payments made.
?Life insurance just became a little more exciting as a result of this unique policy,? Ceylinco Life Managing Director and CEO R. Renganathan said. ?With lump sum payments ranging from 10 per cent to 20 per cent of the sum assured being paid every four years, the policyholder earns a good return while enjoying the protection of the country?s life insurance leader.?
?Ceylinco Life Supreme is therefore a life insurance policy and an investment rolled into one product that offers protection and the opportunity to make aspirations a reality,? he said.
A Ceylinco Life Supreme policy of 12 years will pay 20 percent of the sum assured in the fourth and eighth years of the policy, and pay the full maturity value at the end of the 12th year. A 16-year policy will pay lump sums equivalent to 15 percent of the sum assured in the fourth, eighth and twelfth years, and still pay the maturity value, while a 20 year policy will make four payments of 12 per cent each in the first 16 years of the policy.
On this basis, a 30 year old who obtains a 20-year policy with a basic cover of Rs 500,000 will receive four payments of Rs 60,000 each every four years -- a total of Rs 240,000 in lump sum payments -- in addition to the sum assured or the accumulated balance, which, assuming an annual dividend of 7 per cent could be in the region of Rs 950,000.
Similarly, a 24 year policy will receive five payments, each 10 percent of the sum assured between the fourth and twentieth year, and receive the full maturity value at the end of the term, resulting in the policyholder recovering 50 per cent of the sum assured in addition to the maturity benefit.
Additionally, policyholders have the option of increasing the value of their policies by adding any of the rider benefits available. These include the Ceylinco Life Family Protection benefit that enhances cover, the ?Yugadivi? benefit that extends cover to the spouse, Family Digasiri benefit that covers against 36 critical illnesses, Major Surgery benefit that provides cover for 526 major surgeries and many other similar benefits offered by the life insurance leader.

	?Another reason is that he wanted to give his family the benefit of living and growing up in Australia. Watch this space, as there are quite a few Sri Lankan cricketers who could emulate Wele in the years to come. A lot of them have already applied for citizenship there? added Murugesar.
	Welegedara, 34, has played 21 Test matches for Sri Lanka between 2007 and 2014, capturing 55 wickets and has also played 10 ODIs and two T20 Internationals for the country.
	Welegedara said he decided to quit after being repeatedly ignored by the selectors.
	?Selectors called me last evening and asked me to turn up for practices with Sri Lanka A team. I think they must have got the news of my move and suddenly remembered about me,? Welegedara told ?Daily Mirror?.(Channaka de Silva)

?WorldRemit, the ?WhatsApp of money?, recently launched instant Mobile Money transfers in Sri Lanka.?
Customers in 50 countries can now send money direct to eZ Cash mobile wallets ? just like an instant message.
?WorldRemit?s ground breaking mobile-to-mobile remittance service already enables people to send funds straight to Mobile Money wallets in countries across Africa, Asia and Oceania.?
Now customers can send instant, low-cost money transfers direct to the mobiles of family and friends in Sri Lanka.
?eZ Cash is currently available to Dialog, Etisalat and Hutch subscribers, totalling 14 million people. Sri Lankans, even those without bank accounts, can use eZ Cash to send money to friends, pay water and electricity bills, shop for goods at physical merchants and online, and even pay for health or life insurance premiums.
?It is estimated that there are around three million Sri Lankans living abroad. Remittances to Sri Lanka contributed US$7.036 billion to the Sri Lankan economy in 2014 ? nearly 10 percent of total GDP ? according to the World Bank.
?Alix Murphy, senior mobile analyst at WorldRemit comments: ?We already offer mobile-to-mobile money transfers for countries as far flung as Ghana, Indonesia and Fiji. We?re delighted to roll out the same service to Sri Lanka ? quick and convenient transfers that can be sent just like an instant message.?
?In early 2015, WorldRemit received a US$100m funding round led by Technology Crossover Ventures.
