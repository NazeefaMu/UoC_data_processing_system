Bhuvneshwar wrecks Sri Lanka for 238
	
Bhuvneshwar Kumar captured his maiden five-wicket haul as India restricted Sri Lanka to a modest total of 238 in the fifth and final One Day International (ODI) in Colombo a short while ago.
Captain Upul Tharanga (48 from 34 balls) gave Sri Lanka a flying start, but none at the other end managed to provide any support.
Despite a few early wickets, Lahiru Thirimanne (67) and Angelo Mathews (55) consolidated the innings in the middle order.
However, the Indian bowlers pulled things back in the last 10 overs, to wrap up the hosts for a lowly 238.
India already leads the series convincingly with a 4-0 margin.

Membership tops 2 million - Podujana Peramuna
	
The Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) had recruited more than two million members to the party, it said in a statement today.
In a special two month membership drive, initiated under the patronage of former Parliamentarian Basil Rajapaksa, the SLPP had achieved the target. This is also shown by the record attendance at the May Day rally held at the Galle Face Green, the statement said.
The SLPPs membership drive titled "Samaajikathwaabhishekaya", under the theme Build a village that protects the country was held islandwide followed by a series of conferences.
Through seminars, we were able to set several new political trends. The SLPP is the only party in the country to carry out an active political campaign country wide, it said.
In each electorate people showed willingness to get membership. It is a victory to get this type of a massive response from the general public which helped to reach the target of two million members, it said.

MR should have order probe then not me: Talatha
	
Justice and Foreign Employment Minister Thalatha Athukorale said ex-president Mahinda Rajapaksa had a responsibility to order an inquiry into the untimely death of her brother, UNP's former general secretary Gamini Athukorale in 2002, if he had any suspicions about it.
Responding to journalists on the remarks made by Mr. Rajapaksa that the new Justice Minister, should order a probe into her brothers death, Minister Athukorale said she did not have any doubt on the circumstances that led to her brother's death.
She said this after visiting the Ramanna Nikaya Mahanayake the most Ven. Napane Vijithasiri Mahanayaka Thera.
The new Justice Minister said a canard on the sudden death of her brother was spread at the time with the intention of tarnishing the image of UNP leader Ranil Wickremesinghe who was planning to contest the 2005 presidential election.
She said she was well aware of the secret deals Mr. Atukorale had with Mr. Rajapaksa before his sudden death from a heart attack on January 2, 2002 and added that it was weird and bizarre as to why he suggested that she should initiate a probe into the death of her brother after 10 years.
Mr. Atukorale who was also the deputy leader of the UNP was appointed the Minister of Transport, Highways and Civil Aviation after the UNP won the parliamentary elections held on December 5, 2001. He died of a heart attack at the age of 51, serving only a month as a cabinet minister.
As the younger sister of my brother, I was well aware of the covert alliances my brother had with Mr. Rajapaksa and President Chandrika Kumaratunga. If Mr. Rajapaksa had a slightest doubt on the death of my brother he could have ordered a probe after becoming the President in 2005. He is suggesting that I must hold an inquiry with ulterior motives and with malice, the minister said.
On the comments made by former justice minister Wijedasa Rajapakshe that he was removed from Cabinet for refusing to influence the Attorney Generals Department, the minister said there was a time the AGs Department was blatantly influenced by Mr. Rajapaksa.
"Mr. Rajapaksa taking over the AGs Department was undemocratic, unfair and affected the independence of that department. It was under the Rajapaksa rule that a highly independent and unbiased Chief Justice was summarily sent home in 28 hours. Field Marshal Sarath Fonseka, who led the war against the LTTE was arrested illegally and sent to the prison after a sham Court Martial," she said.
The minister assured that under the 'yahapalanaya government' the judicial independence and the independence of the AGs Department would be upheld and protected. (Sandun A Jayasekera)

Sack SF from his portfolio: Wimal
	
National Freedom Front (NFF) leader Wimal Weerawansa said today Minister and Field Marshal, Sarath Fonseka should be removed from his portfolio for making a traitorous statement on former army commander Jagath Jayasuriya just as former minister Wijeyadasa Rajapakshe was removed for violating collective Cabinet responsibility.
He told a news conference that if the government failed to do so one could then assume that the statement made by Mr. Fonseka was its view as well.
The government should take action against the minister. Former minister Rajapakshe was removed for making a statement against the sale of the Hambantota port. So why should Mr. Fonseka not removed for making a traitorous statement, Mr. Weerawansa asked.
He said if he had evidence against Mr. Jayasuriya, he should have complained to the police to take legal action against him without making allegations before the whole world and added that several military personnel had been punished on such complaints.
Channel4 is making allegations against Mr. Jayasuriya. Mr. Fonsekas allegations would fuel such sinister moves. If there are any complaints, there are ways of taking action against the wrongdoers. It is not his duty or responsibility to make statements which betray the army, Mr. Weerawansa said.(Ajith Siriwardana)

Wont allow anyone to touch Jagath Jayasuriya: President
	
President Maithripala Sirisena said today he would never allow former Army Commander (Rtd) General Jagath Jayasuriya or any other war hero to be hauled before an international criminal court or war tribunal as long as he remained the President of Sri Lanka.
He said the threat of war crimes charges, economic sanctions and the hostile attitude of the global community against Sri Lanka was the direct result of the Mahinda Rajapaksa regimes failure to create an atmosphere of reconciliation, reconstruction and rehabilitation in a country and a nation which was in tatters after the war.
Addressing a massive gathering of party supporters and well wishers who had converged from all parts of the country to celebrate the SLFP's 66th anniversary celebrations held at Campbell Park, Borella last afternoon, the President recalled ex-president Rajapaksas unilateral decision to declare presidential election two years ahead of time said he wrote to him highlighting six points as to why he should not hold an early election.
I told him in writing in April 2014 not to hold an early presidential poll for six reasons when such an idea was mooted. The then government had miserably failed to introduce reforms and a proper reconciliation process to build the shattered lives of the people in the North and East. We also had so much of work to complete which the government had failed to do. All constituent party leaders of the UPFA also were of the view that the government must complete its full term before declaring the poll. But he did not listen and went ahead and perished. Mr. Rajapaksa felt he could not face the impending economic melt down, the crisis brewing in the domestic front, the extremely hostile attitude of the global community and UN agencies. The SLFP Central Committee, the Cabinet and the leaders of other political parties of the UPFA were dumb and blind to these developments,the President said. "Under this highly inhospitable global and domestic environment, what would have been the situation had there been no regime change and I was not elected as the President."
As the newly elected President, he said he explained how he met world leaders and requested them to give him some space to rebuild the nation, save the country from disaster, introduce reform programmes, restore democracy, the rule of law, media and judicial freedom and put in place a result oriented reconciliation process to which all leaders agreed and promised full support.
Consequent to the positive and cooperative atmosphere the unity government was able to build up about Sri Lanka among the international community after the January 2015 victory, Sri Lanka was able to regain the GSP+ facility and the EU withdrew the export ban on fish exports. The UNHRC gave Sri Lanka a grace period of two years until September 2019 to address the human rights issues highlighted in the Geneva resolution co-sponsored by Sri Lanka, he said.
He said the Unity Government had done a lot for the country during the past two years and asked what would have been the position of the SLFP if the UNP went for an election after the 2015 presidential election victory.
I admit that we have made some lapses and mistakes. But I dont condone the unfair criticism of the Yahapalana Government because we have been able to do much for the country having saved it from a disaster, the President said.
He said the manner in which some people were using the new and unrestricted freedom was somewhat unusual and the insults, mudslinging, canards and misinformation posted on Facebook, media websites and other electronic and print media against me and against the Yahapalana Government was unprecedented.
"The SLFP was formed by the founding father S.W.R.D.Bandaranaike to take the country on a new path. The concept of patriotism, our country, our culture and our nation mindset was first mooted with the establishment of the new party departing from the west-aligned culture that existed since independence," the President said. "In the short period of three and half years that the SLFP ruled the country from 1956, Mr. Bandaranaike was able to introduce a series of people-friendly programmes amid heavy opposition from rival political parties. He had a new vision and new ideology for the country. There is no leader like Mr. Bandaranaike who was insulted, ridiculed and harassed. He was branded Sevala Banda' and a spineless leader by his political opponents. Sir John Kotalawela, the Prime Minister before Mr. Bandaranaike said Mr. Bandaranaike let loose the dogs he had caged indicating the socialist and progressive policies he adopted for the nationalization programme and other people friendly projects."
The President said Mr. Bandaranaike mortgaged his Rosemead Place residence to fund the SLFP and after his assassination in September 1959, Ms. Bandaranaike had to leave the place with her three children as she was not in a position to pay the debt, but Sir John intervened and saved the day for her.
But this is how out past leaders did politics. They did not come to politics, to get commissions and bribes and embezzle billions like certain other politicians who took to politics as a business. Nepotism was never an issue in the SLFP in the past," he said.
The President appealed to SLFPers to assist him to rescue their beloved party that had been infected with corruption, nepotism, crimes and waste in the recent past and take the party to victory in 2020 through a clean and robust political campaign.
"Our vision and mission is to create a Sri Lanka free of corruption, waste and nepotism. The SLFP is capable of doing that and our aim is to form a SLFP government in 2020 with those values. I am ready to achieve that target with your support, blessings and cooperation, he said.
Ministers Nimal Siripala De Silva, S.B. Dissanayaka, Sarath Amunugama, Susil Premajayantha, W.D.J. Seneviratne, Jaffna District UPFA member Angajan Ramanathan and former SLFP MP and SLFP youth organization General Secretary Shantha Bandara presented the various resolutions.(Sandun A Jayasekera)
