$16.4 million "Monkey Kingdom" launched today in Sri Lanka
	
-Extension to France by Sri Lanka Tourism in November!!
The epic $16.4 million Monkey Kingdom Directed by Mark Linfield and Alastair who also directed Bears and narrated by Tina Fey will debut it's launch today at Excel Cinema and then across the country by EAP Films which is memorable given the Hollywood success that the film has had in the last four months in the United States said Dr. Rohantha Athukorala Chairman Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau.
Athukorala cited how one typical American kid had said "My favorite part of this movie is when all the monkeys are playing with each other and swinging from their homemade original jungle gym and the lower class runs out of food and have to find a way to survive. They then raid humans house and raid their kitchen. They even confiscate all the eggs from the hen house!! It is hysterical to see a monkey running off with a sub sandwich"
A top producer in the US commented my favorite character is Kip, Mayas son ! He is a cute baby monkey that is so innocent and, most of the time, has no idea what is going one. He depends on his mom for protection. Maya is on the low end of the social hierarchy. She is a female monkey with a nice personality unlike the three sister queens who act as if they own everything. I love how Maya protects her baby at all costs. 
This is the eighth True Adventure film and the sixth released theatrically by Disney nature, the in dependent film label of Walt Disney Studio. The last such documentary fetched $35 million in ticket sales.
Sri Lanka Tourism Spring boarding on the US success is planning to stage a special screening of French version of this movie  Au Royaume des Singes for travel trade professionals in Paris, France during November said Dr. Athukorala who believes that rather than just awareness of Sri Lanka as a tourist destination we must build equity of the brand among the targeted travelers and industry professionals in the country.
Sri Lanka Tourism will join hands with Sri Lankan Airlines to organize the private screening of Au Royaume des Singes at Gaumont Champs Elysees Marignan with the participation of over 6000 travel trade professionals. During the special preview, SL Tourism will conduct educational session for the travel trade on the history and culture of the country and showcase the cultural diversity through traditional dance performances and culinary delights. This initiative will be backed by a comprehensive promotional campaign on web sites, on cinemas, outdoor advertising and community involvement projects to create high level of awareness about the history and culture of Sri Lanka among the target French travelers with the hype created by the film said Miss Sarangi Thilakasena , Market Head for France at the Sri Lanka Tourism Promotions Bureau. This will be hitting French cinemas on 11th November 2015 she said.
The film is directed by Mark Linfield and Alastair Fothergill, who were responsible for other Disney blockbusters such as Earth, which grossed more than $100 million at the box office. Their last movie 2012 movie Chimpanzee, filmed in West Africa, grossed almost $35 million, a record for a wildlife documentary. The film has the potential for Sri Lanka to create top of the mind brand recall among families, nature and cultural tourism enthusiasts around the world said Ms.Thilakasena.

	The Pivithuru Hela Urumaya (PHU) general secretary Udaya Gammanpila said today the SLFPs decision to form a national government with the United National Front for Good Governance (UNFGG) was against the mandate because people voted for the UPFA in protest of UNFGGs manifesto.
	Mr. Gammanpila said there was no mentioning of forming a national government in UPFAs manifesto and that former president Mahinda Rajapaksa completely rejected the national government concept in his election rallies.
	People voted for UPFA because they rejected UNPs manifesto and forming a national government with them is against the mandate. We saw what happened to those who acted against the mandate at the general election. The same thing will happen to those who act against the mandate at the next election, he said.
	Mr. Gammanpila told media when he arrived at the SIU to make a statement that they were committed to uphold the mandate and said they would not hesitate to come forward if something detrimental happen to the country.
	He said a false complaint had been lodged against him by Minister Champika Ranawaka and three others to sling mud at him before the election and police had realised the true nature of the complaint and that the police would not expect to continue the investigations into the complaint.
	Mr. Gammanpila said he would take legal action against those who lodged the false compliant to tarnish his image.(Ajith Siriwardana and Indika Sri Aravinda)WATCH

New laws to tackle crime: Champika
	
The new-UNP led government would give priority to introduce legislation strengthening financial crimes and similar other crime busting and to give more legal teeth to the Bribery Commission as existing laws were not sufficient to deal with financial mismanagement, embezzling, corruption and fraud, former minister Patali Champika Ranawaka said.
Addressing the media after a successful election campaign that brought the UNP-led rainbow coalition - the UNFGG - to power, Mr. Ranawaka said there was a huge challenge before the new government as the confidence and expectation reposed on the new government by over 5 million voters were immense.
The people expect the government to continue the investigations by the Financial Crimes Investigation Division (FCID), the Police, the CID and the Bribery Commission on corruption, money laundering, misuse of state assets, ethanol and drug peddling in a more vigorous footing and bring perpetrators to book as early as possible. But the current laws and the judicial system are not strong enough to successfully tackle those crimes and convict and punish those charged. That is why we need new legislation to strengthen the relevant law enforcement institutions and the judicial system to address this problem sooner than later, Mr. Ranawaka stressed.(Sandun Jayasekara)

Shaveen declares campaign expenditure
	
	Independent contestant, Shaveen Bandaranayaka, the son of former Chief Justice Shirani Bandaranayake, who had managed to bag 149 votes at the recently concluded Parliamentary election has declared a detailed breakdown of his election campaign expenditure.
	Shaveen had posted the declaration on his Facebook last week (14), providing a detailed breakdown of the expenditure incurred on his campaigning activities. According to the post he had spent a total of Rs. 178,164 between July 14  August 14 to which included costs borne on leaflets, Facebook advertisements and newspaper advertisements. The highest expenditure had been on Facebook advertisements - Rs. 65,805 that amounted to a 37% off the total campaigning expenses. 
	He has noted the finances were borne through his personal savings.
	Although Shaveen declared his campaign expenditure duly, despite being a first-time contestant many of the seniors in the field of politics in Sri Lanka are yet to follow suit. The issue of campaign financing and its impacts on a democratic political system was highlighted by several election monitors that held media briefings following the conclusion of the poll on Wednesday. It was pointed out by the Commonwealth observers that setting limitations on election campaigning is important as the campaign financing disparity among candidates can be a major hindrance to democracy.(Lakna Paranamanna)

SLFP agrees to join National Govt.
	
The SLFP Central Committee today decided to form a national government with the UNP for two years with either party failing to secure an overall majority to form a government at this election.
The UNP, the party with the single highest number of seats, got 106 seats in the new parliament, falling short of seven more slots for the simple majority. The SLFP-led UPFA received 96 seats.
The SLFP Central Committee even appointed a six-member committee headed by former President Chandrika Kumaratunga to work out the modalities for the formation of this government with the UNP. It comprises former Ministers S.B. Dissanayake, Dr. Sarath Amunugama, Mahinda Samarasinghe, Susil Premajayantha and Nimal Siripala de Silva.
However, a section of the SLFPs new parliamentary group is opposed to the formation of a national government. President Maithripala Sirisena met the newly elected SLFP members yesterday to discuss the national government concept.
The President said the party should take people oriented decisions regarding national issues and only then it would propel the country to new heights.
At the meeting, a committee headed by Ratnapura district MP elect John Seneviratne was appointed to hold talks with the other members of the group, and submit a report on their ideas regarding the national government. The committee comprises Mr. Susil Premajayantha, Anura Priyadarshana Yapa, Keheliya Rambukwella and Kumara Welgama.
In the meantime, another set of senior members held the view that the SLFP should get the Cabinet portfolios of Finance, Law and Order, Trade, Education and Highways in such a government. They opined at the meeting the party should not compromise for less influential ministerial posts as in the 100-day government. (Kelum Bandara)
