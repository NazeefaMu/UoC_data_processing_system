Assault on SL envoy: Malaysia to review KLIA security procedures
	
Police are reviewing the security procedures at the Kuala Lumpur International Airport (KLIA) following Sunday's assault on Sri Lanka's High Commissioner to Malaysia Ibrahim Sahib Ansar.
This is to being done to establish if there is a need to deploy more personnel there, or for changes to be made on security duty procedures. Federal police Management Department director Datuk Seri Zulkifli Abdullah said any changes on security procedures at the KLIA will be determined from an assessment by the Selangor police chief.
"I believe that the Selangor police chief is looking into this matter, and we (Management Department) are open to suggestions.
"If there is a need to increase the number of personnel at KLIA, we will increase, or (improve) the way duties are carried out. "Because sometimes, adding more people might not be the answer, but it is about the way we do the job, how we uti0lise the technology we have and so forth," he told reporters at the Royal Malaysian Police College in Cheras, in Kuala Lumpur earlier today.
Zulkifli was representing the Inspector-General of Police at the annual assembly of police's civilian officers. He said the review, however, is not a mere reaction as police always conduct reviews on security procedures from time to time. At the press conference, Zulkifli said police are also hopeful that the government would hire more civilian officers, especially professionals, to assist the force in their management.
He said police now have around 14,000 civilian officers, with less than 10 per cent from professional backgrounds. The force needs an additional of 1,000 more.

Bribery Com. files action against Aluthgamage
	
The Bribery Commission today filed action against former Sports Minister Mahindananda Aluthgamage for allegedly using state funds to import game boards worth over Rs.53.1 million to be distributed in the run up to the 2015 Presidential Election campaign.
The Commission filed charges against the former Minister and the Storekeeper of the Sports Ministry Nishantha Gunasekara at the Colombo Chief Magistrates Court under case number 59720/1/2016.
According to Bribery Commission sources, Aluthgamage had ordered the Cooperatives Wholesale Establishment (CWE) to purchase a stock of Carom Boards and Draughts Boards worth the said amount on behalf of the Ministry of Sports.
Accordingly, 14, 000 Caroms Boards and 11, 000 Draughts Boards had been imported from India during the period between September 01, 2014 to December, 2014 in five shipments.
In the Bribery Commission probe disclosed that the Sports Ministry Storekeeper Nishantha Gunasekara had signed the papers acknowledging receipt of the consignment of game boards to the Ministrys storeroom but it had not reached there.
Instead the consignment had been sent to a private warehouse at Mabima in Biyagama where most of the goods to be distributed in favour of former President Mahinda Rajapaksas 2015 Presidential Election Campaign had been stored, the sources said.
The game boards, which were initially imported to be distributed among schools and youth clubs countrywide had been distributed in the election campaign to encourage the supporters, the sources further said. The case will be taken up on September 27. (Kurulu Koojana Kariyakarawana)

Capital Alliance trailblazes new frontier in financial markets with digital signature capability
	
Sri Lankas leading investment banking firm and the preferred partner in financial markets, Capital Alliance (CAL), is taking its digital initiatives forward and is the first company in Sri Lanka to allow customers onboard in a fully paperless manner using e-Signatures.
This groundbreaking adoption of technology by CAL empowers customers to open an account by placing digital signatures while being anywhere in the world thus eliminating the need to fill application forms manually. The entire process has been formulated in compliance with the provisions of the Electronic Transactions Act No. 19 of 2006 and is expected to revolutionize convenience and speed related to investment banking transactions.
In rolling this out, CAL has partnered with eMudhra Ltd, which is a leading Certifying Authority in Asia and is a pioneer in e-Signatures, digital identity, and authentication solutions with marquee clients in BFSI (Banking, Financial services and Insurance) and various other sectors.
Ajith Fernando, Managing Director, CAL, commented on this path-breaking innovation, CAL is proud to introduce the digital signature facility for the first time in the country. This service will enable speedy transactions in a highly secure manner that protects customer data privacy. With this facility we have technically turned each smart phone into a branch, thats approximately 6 million additional branches.
We were an institutional player thus far as we didnt see an economical way of taking our products to the retail market, but this service enables us to enter the retail space. Our company has always been technology-driven with a fully integrated software system that seamlessly integrates the back-office system with an online trading system. This is yet another digital innovation by CAL to demonstrate our cutting edge technology expertise. We are committed to leveraging technology and innovation to deliver the utmost convenience and benefits of digital banking.
Kaushik Srinivasan, Director, eMudhra, said: Using eMudhras solutions helps in minimizing the use of physical documents and provides authenticity of e-documents. The ease of use and accessibility through various devices make it extremely convenient and easy for customers to access their documents quickly and securely from anywhere anytime.
The system comprises of both automatic and manual verifications to ensure the authenticity of customers. There are some foolproof automatic validation measures that are inbuilt in the system in order to safeguard clients interest and data security.
Once the client fills in basic data (Name, email, mobile phone number and interested product), an auto generated URL and portal password will be sent to the users email box in order to complete the application form. This URL is valid for 24 hours only. Once the application is filled and customer wishes to place his or her digital signature, an OTP (One time password/passcode) will be generated and sent to clients given mobile number. This is the two factor authentication in addition to the password via email.
Adding another layer of security, the customer application forms will be encrypted using PKI infrastructure to ensure the authenticity of the user so that no tampering takes place during the application transmission from front-end to back-office. Apart from the above mentioned automatic verifications, two manual verifications will be carried out, one by the back-office user to validate the supporting documents and content on the application; and the other by the Relationship manager to get to know the customer and validate submitted information in an in-depth manner.
In addition to the above, the system has a practically unbreakable PKI encryption to validate the authenticity and the legitimacy of the application form submitted; auto generated passwords, SMS which are time bound and expires after a defined lifetime; ability to generate the internal workflow, therefore least manual interaction is required; detailed audit logs capable of providing information in case of a dispute; and is locally hosted at CAL, therefore, customer information resides within CAL.

Duminda, four others sentenced to death
	
Former Parliamentarian Duminda Silva and four others were sentenced to death by the Colombo High Court today over the 2011 killing of former presidential adviser Bharatha Lakshman Premachandra and three others.
The verdict was given on 1/2 majority by the trial at bar comprising Judges Shiran Gunaratne (President), Pathmini N Ranawaka and MCBS Morais.
The accused were convicted on charges of rioting, unlawful assembly with common objective to commit a crime, criminal intimidation causing death or grievous hurt and the charge of murder under the Penal Code and Firearms Ordinance.
The verdict was divided when the president of the trial at bar, Judge Shiran Gunaratne delivered his judgment acquitting all 13 accused from all charges filed against them due to the lack of integrity of the witnesses produced by the prosecution during the trial and prosecutions inability to prove beyond reasonable doubt over the given charges precisely.
Accused Withanalage Anura Thushara de Mel (1st accused) was convicted on eight charges while other accused Chaminda Ravi Jayanath alias Dematagoda Chaminda (3rd accused), Sarath Bandara and Janaka Bandara Galagoda (10th accused), who had gone missing, and Duminda Silva (11th accused) were convicted on ten counts each.
Apart from the murder charge, the third, seventh, tenth and eleventh accused were fined Rs. 40,000 and imposed 26 and a half years Rigorous Imprisonment with lifetime imprisonments over the other charges while the other first accused of the case was fined Rs. 20,000 and imposed 22 and a half years rigorous imprisonment with lifetime imprisonments.
Eight accused, Chandana Jagath Kumara, Lanka Rasanjana, Malaka Sameera, Widanage Amila, Suranga Premalal, Saman Kumara Abeywickrama, Rohana Marasinghe and Liyanarachchi Shaminda were acquitted by the trial at bar unanimously over all charges filed against them into the incident as the prosecution failed to prove charges on them beyond reasonable doubt.
Delivering the majority judgment, High Court Judge Pathmini N Ranawaka observed that the prosecution had proved during the trial, that the 11th accused of the case, Duminda Silva had lead the other suspects to the crime carrying the intention to kill the victim, Mr. Premachandra using the event as an opportunity, since it was evident that the accused had a long running resentment with the victim.
The Judge also held that according to the medical reports submitted in court by the prosecution; the accused Mr. Silva had been influenced with alcohol when the brawl and shooting were taken place within the Kolonnawa electorate, during the Local Government elections in October, 2011 against the victims side.
Rejecting the defence argument raised during the trial that the Duminda Silva was first shot by the opposition at the shooting the Judge ascertained that the accused as a parliamentarian and a well known person about the armed security attached to the Mr. Premachandra, he should have acted having the awareness of the consequences could occur from such a shooting..
Defence counsel Anil Silva PC who appeared for the convict Duminda Silva observed that such a verdict of an accused carrying a serious illness of life threatening being convicted with capital punishment was seen in first time in the country's legal arena.
Meanwhile, delivering dock statements before the death penalty was pronounced, all four convicts including Duminda Silva told court that they were innocent and not guilty over the charges put forward against them.
Earlier, the Attorney General had filed indictments against 13 individuals including Duminda Silva on 17 counts over the killing of Mr. Premachandra, and three of his aides.
The killing took place within the Kolonnawa electorate, during the Local Government elections in October, 2011. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

Everything You Need To Know About the New iPhone 7
	
The wait is over, the iPhone 7 is here. Apple unveiled its new generations of smartphones;iPhone 7 and iPhone 7 plus. Both models will be available to preorder on Friday, September 9th, and begin shipping a week later on September 16th.
In Dailymirror Tech, we ran a write up on awesome features of iOS 10 , and this new operating system will ship with latest iPhone models.
Without further ado, lets have a look on all new shiny iPhone 7. Heres everything you needto know about the new iPhone 7.
Reengineered Home button
The home button has been reengineered from the ground up and it is customizable on the iPhone 7. The iPhone 7s solid state home button is now Force Touch sensitive and works together with Apples Taptic engine to be more responsive to a wider range of frequencies.The new home button is used throughout iOS, providing unique feedback for messages,notifications, ringtones and navigation.Waterproof DesignBoth the iPhone 7 and 7 Plus are waterand dustresistant (IP67), meaning youre free to get them wet without worry. That means youll be able to take either of them underwater for about 30 minutes, up to 1 meter deep.Improved Physical DesignWhile the new iPhones maintain the same basic shape and styling of the 6/6s generations, a number of improvements have been made to the physical design. It also comes in two new finishes, black and jet black, the latter of which appears to be a point of pride for Apple, with a glossy, mirrored design. The camera and antennas have been embedded into the phones aluminium body, making for cleaner lines.
New camera system
Apple has upgraded the iPhones camera system with a f/1.8 aperture, sixelement lens, a larger sensor, a flash with four discrete LEDs, and a builtin flicker sensor  all of which means that the camera should take better photos, even in weird, flickering fluorescent lighting.
But the biggest camera improvement is exclusive to the heftier iPhone 7 Plus, which has a dual camera system that, for the first time, allows for 2x optical zoom without any loss of image quality. Switching between the two cameras is seamless: just tap the 1x or 2x button in the camera app and it switches automatically, or smoothly zoom between them using an onscreen slider.
Better Stereo Sound
For the first time, the iPhone 7 now has onboard stereo speakers  one at the top and one atbottom of the device. Apple says this makes the sound it produces twice as loud, andincreased dynamic range means it should sound better as well. However, those speakersare exactly where the headphone jack used to be.
No More Headphone Jack
Apple is notorious for being the first to drop longstanding technological standards, and thistime around its the ubiquitous 3.5mm headphone jack. The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus no longerfeature a 3.5mm headphone jack. That means youll have to rely on a Lightning converter foryour current headphones, or upgrade to a pair of Bluetooth earbuds.
Apple will be including earpods with a lightning cable connection in the box, along with a small lightning to headphone jack adapter cable for using your standard headphones.
Better Performance
The iPhone 7 and 7 Plus utilize Apples most powerful processor ever  the A10 Fusion. Its a 64bitquadcore processor thats 40 percent faster than the A9 in the iPhone 6S and 6S Plus. Apple says its 120 times faster than the original iPhone.
Long Battery Life
The battery is also the best ever compared to previous iPhones. Apple says the new iPhone 7 will last 2 hours more than the iPhone 6S, and the iPhone 7 Plus will add an additional hour over the iPhone 6S Plus. Well just have to wait until the 16th of September to see the first teardowns that will reveal the actual battery capacity.

JO urges Govt. to declare definite date for LG elections
	
The Joint Opposition today urged the Government to declare a definite date to hold the local government election despite making contradictory statements.
Addressing a media briefing, Joint Opposition MP Mahinda Yapa Abeywardena said President Maithripala Sirisena had once stated that the local government election would be held on January 12 even though subject Minister Faiszer Musthapha had stated that it would be held in February.
It is evident from these contradictory statements that the Government is not keen on holding the local government election as they fear that they would be defeated in the election. The people are losing faith in the Government with these contradictory statements, he added.
He said the Joint Opposition would declare from which party they would participate in the local government election with the publics recommendation, once the date of the nominations is announced.
Meanwhile, he said the assault on Sri Lankas High Commissioner Ibrahim Ansar at Kuala Lumpur on Sunday was well calculated incident though some parties attempted to interpret it as an isolated incident.
He said the Joint Opposition condemned the assault on Mr. Ansar and the Sri Lankan Government should be more responsible while handling such issues in the future.
The Government's unacceptable process which continues as the reconciliation has worsened these issues to the extent that we have lost its control, he added. (Kalathma Jayawardhane)

The Committee on Public Enterprises (COPE) will present its next report, with details of the controversial bond issue, in Parliament on October 13 this year, its chairman Sunil Handunnetti said yesterday.
Mr. Handunnetti said this in response to an allegation by Joint opposition MP Bandula Gunawardena that there was a sinister move to sweep the bond issue under the carpet.
"There is no sinister move to sweep the issue under the carpet; COPE is working according to a road map with regard to the Bond issue, and the details of it will be included in the next report which will come out on October 13," he said.
He said that all the documents pertaining to the bond issue would be included in the report.
It will be possible to have a debate on this report once it is presented in the House" he said.
Mr Gunawardena asked why the COPE report which was presented in Parliament last month did not give special consideration to the Bond issue.
We believe that there is a move to sweep the bond scam under the carpet through various means. Several tactics have been adopted for this purpose, such as changing the membership of COPE," he said. (Yohan Perera and Kelum Bandara)

Serious blow to London banks if UK quits single market: EU commissioner
	
AFP - The EU will not allow Britain to cling to advantages for its financial industry while blocking free movement of labour in the wake of Brexit, commissioner Valdis Dombrovskis warned yesterday.
We cannot tolerate cherry-picking, the Brussels financial services chief told German business daily Handelsblatt.
Its up to the British government. If it decides not only to leave the EU but the single market as well, there will be serious effects on the City of London, he said.
Londons financial district has benefited from Britains EU membership as a foothold in the single market for British and non-EU banks.
Huge volumes of euro-denominated trade pass through Britain thanks to so-called passporting rules, which allow the UK to host transactions in the single currency despite not itself being a part of the eurozone.
But in the wake of the nations June 23 vote to quit the European Union, that access may be under threat.
Without a deal to remain a part of the internal market -- which Dombrovskis insisted must include the four freedoms of movement of capital, goods, services and labour -the City of London risks losing those rights.
Several major players in the sector, including US giant JP Morgan and Swiss UBS, have warned that thousands of jobs could leave the Square Mile financial district for the continent if that happens.
Eurozone banking centres including Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and Dublin are all elbowing for position to benefit from any mass exodus from the City.
The commissioner offered some crumbs of comfort for the UK, saying that the question of passporting was not immediately up for discussion -and noted that new prime minister Theresa May has yet to trigger a two-year exit negotiation period.
In the meantime, he said, the UK remains an EU member and will have to implement any and all financial regulation decided on by Brussels.
Britain is also certain to lose the European Banking Authority regulator, Dombrovskis continued, telling Handelsblatt that all EU authorities must of course be headquartered in the EU.
Dombrovskis intervention comes on the same day as EU president Donald Tusk travelled to London for talks with May to discuss the Brexit process.
At the beginning of the meeting on Downing Street, Tusk told May: Im aware that it is not easy but I still hope you will be ready to start the process as soon as possible.

Six year old girl found killed and buried
	
The body of a 6-year-old Vedda girl who is believed to have been murdered was found buried in the jungle near Neelankeni in Sampur today.
According to police, the girl was living with her grandmother in a Vedda village and had gone missing last morning when she was reportedly playing with a 17-year-old boy from the neighbourhood.
Soon after the girls disappearance the residents had alerted the police and a search operation had been launched.
The police, on suspicion, had questioned the boy who had played with her in the morning and gone to a place in the forest that the boy had led them to -- where the missing girl was said to have last been seen.
Police had failed to hold the boy as he had left the scene shortly afterwards.
The body had been identified as that of the missing girl. It had been taken to the Muttur Hospital mortuary for the post mortem. Her mother had left the country sometime ago for employment.
A team from the Sampur Police are conducting inquiries on the instructions of the Trincomalee Division SSP. (Amadoru Amarajeewa)

Thajudeen Murder: Carlton House included in Pres. Sec. phone network
	
Senior State Counsel Dilan Ratnayake informed Court that it had been revealed that Carlton House in Hambanthota had been included in the internal phone network connection of the Presidential Secretariat.
Earlier, the CID had informed court that there were phone calls from the Presidential Secretariat and Temple Trees to Narahenpita Police OIC Damien Perera on the day that Wasim Thajudeen was found dead.
The state counsel also said that, according to statements recorded from a few witnesses, the former chief JMO Ananda Samarasekara had dispatched body parts of Wasim Thajudeen from the refrigerator a few days prior to his retirement.
The CID had also informed court that it had begun an investigation concerning the missing body parts under the Public Property Act -- because the body parts had earlier been taken into the former JMO's custody as case productions and, therefore, they belonged to the state.
Considering the requests of the aggrieved party and the prosecution, Magistrate Nishantha Peiris ordered the Director General of the Colombo National Hospital to submit a comprehensive report on whether former SDIG Anura Senanayake had received treatments at the CNH or any other hospitals from 2003 to date (regarding his so- called illnesses). The magistrate also ordered the DG to submit a medical report on the present medical condition of the SDIG and the necessity for him to be treated continuously at a paying ward in the CNH.
The prosecution said that the suspects -- former SDIG Anura Senanayake and former Narahenpita Crimes OIC Sumith Perera -- had been charged under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of acommon intention) of the Penal Code, and that according to the provision in Section 13 of the Bail Act, a person who had been charged with an offence punishable with death or with life imprisonment, shall not be released on bail except by a judge of the High Court.
They had been arrested by the CID and charged under Sections 113 (Conspiracy) and 32 (Liability for act done by several persons in furtherance of a common intention) of the Penal Code in connection with the murder of ruggerite Wasim Thajudeen.
Considering that the suspects had already filed revision bail applications in the High Court, the magistrate re-remanded the suspects till September 21.
The former SDIG and the former Crimes OIC have also been charged with causing the disappearance of evidence, fabricating false evidence, using it to shield the offender and conspiring under Clauses of 189,198 and 296 of the Penal Code. (Shehan Chamika Silva)

We hope to recruit more Tamils for Security Forces: PM
	
Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe told Parliament today the Government was hoping to increase the percentage of Tamils in the Security Forces, the Police Service and the Prison Service.
Responding to a question asked by EPDP leader Douglas Devananda, the Prime Minister said Sri Lanka's first Army Commander Anton Muthukumara was a Tamil. He said there were Tamil-speaking officers in Police Service, but the situation changed after 1978.
He said the LTTE started killing Tamil police officers and this hindered recruitment because it resulted in Tamils being discouraged from joining the service.
"Specially after 1983, recruitment of Tamils became much less. There were not enough educated Tamils to be recruited from the estate sector. Even those with educational qualifications joined other services," he said.
The Prime Minister said 216 personnel were recruited to the police service from the North and the East and this was only the beginning. Besides, he said 409 others were recruited as prison officers.
"Now we have must increase the percentage in the Security Forces, Police Service and the Prison Service, he said. (Kelum Bandara and Yohan Perera)
